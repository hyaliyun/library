E. Smith, the final novel in his Skylark series. Written as Smith's last novel in 1965 and published shortly before his death, it expands on the characterizations of the earlier novels (written 1919 - about 1938) with some discrepancies (some of which may relate to unwritten background developments). Marc DuQuesne, the major villain of the three previous novels, is shown to have matured, reformed, and been offered a chance at what amounts to a pardon for his prior crimes against the heroes. The book ends with Dick Seaton and DuQuesne teaming up to perpetrate a galaxy-wide genocide against the Chlorans, causing all their suns to go nova. This act is condoned with the argument that otherwise the Chlorans would have eventually broken out of their galaxy and taken over the entire universe; Seaton compares the Chlorans to a cancer which must be destroyed \\"to the last cell\\". The Chlorans themselves, though depicted earlier in the book as extremely cruel, were not bent on exterminating humans but only enslaving and exploiting them. Skylark DuQuesne was first serialized in IF Worlds of Science Fiction beginning in June 1965 before being published in 1966 by Pyramid Books. The novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1966.

Built in 1887 to a design by Henry M. Francis, it is the town's most architecturally elaborate school building. It served as the town's high school until 1961, and now houses the local council on the aging. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The former Murdock School building is located in the town center of Winchendon, on flanking the west side of Monument Park, west of the commercial downtown area. It is 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick and covered by a slate roof. It is richly detailed in the Romanesque style, with a gabled pavilion projecting from its front facade. Prominent features of the projecting section are a tall square tower at the right side, with a pyramidal roof topped by a copper finial and cross. The left side of the projection has a less tall chimney adorned with brick corbelling and covered by a copper cap. The main entrance is in the center of the projection, recessed under a wide round arch. The school was built in 1887 with funds donated by Captain Ephraim Murdock, Jr., whose father had previously donated the Winchendon Academy building to the town, and was a friend of educator Horace Mann. Operation of the school was originally funded by a trust fund established by Murdock, providing a college preparatory education at no cost to Winchendon students, and was administered by the town's school committee. In the early 20th century, the trust fund began to run out of funds, and the town took over funding. The building served the town as a school building until 1962, when a new high school (now an elementary school) was built to the north.

He developed a valuable system of intubation in diphtheria cases. O'Dwyer is often cited as the \\"father of laryngeal intubation in croup\\". Life 'City Hospital, Blackwell's Island' Joseph P. O'Dwyer was born on October 12, 1841 in Cleveland, Ohio, and was educated in London, Ontario. After two years of apprenticeship in the office of one Dr. Anderson, he entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York from which he was graduated in 1865. He won first place in the competitive examination for resident physicians of New York's Charity Hospital, on Blackwell's Island. The island housed a penitentiary, women's asylum, and other facilities for the criminal, the insane, and the destitute. Opened in 1860, City Hospital was renamed Charity Hospital in 1870, and was among New York City's largest institutions for the treatment of illnesses among the poor. O'Dwyer was in charge of the medical service during a cholera epidemic. During his service, a typhus epidemic also broke out. O'Dwyer contracted typhus, but made a full recovery. After the completion of his service, in 1868 he set up in private practice on Second Avenue near Fifty-fifth St. Four years later (1872), he moved to Lexington Avenue near Sixty-sixth St. and began his long association with the New York Foundling Asylum.Walsh, James Joseph. \\"Joseph O'Dwyer.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 4 July 2015 Intubation New York Foundling Asylum, 175 East 68th Street In the 1800s diphtheria was a devastating disease, especially lethal in children. The cause of death was usually asphyxia due to an obstructed airway. A tracheotomy was often a necessary procedure to save a patient suffering with diphtheria from suffocation. This was, at that time, a high-risk procedure, even post- operative. In 1858, Paris pediatrician Eugene Bouchut devised a method to bypass the diphtheria pseudomembrane obstructing the larynx without resorting to a tracheotomy. However, Bouchut's proposal was not well received, due in part to the opposition of Armand Trousseau, the known authority on tracheotomies. The use of tracheotomy had fallen into disrepute at the Foundling Hospital with a record 100% death rate,Northrup, W.P., American Practitioner and News, Volumes 25-26, 1898, p.200 among children due to suffocation when diphtheria brought about closure of the larynx. O'Dwyer and his colleague at the Foundling Hospital, W.P.Northrup, experimented with various approaches to keep the laryngeal airway open.Gelfand, Craig. \\"Diptheria: Dr. Joseph O'Dwyer and his intubation tubes\\", Caduseus, Vol.3, No.2, summer 1987 At first, O'Dwyer experimented with his device on cadavers. Sr. Irene with children at New York Foundling The use of a tube for intubation had often been attempted but unsuccessfully. After five years of study, working with surgeon George Fell, by 1885 O'Dwyer had devised a set of tubes of graduating in size to fit children from one to ten years of age. He also developed a procedure for the insertion and extraction of the tube, using specially designed instruments.Truax, Charles. The Mechanics of Surgery, Chicago, 1899 After a number of refinements the final tubes, made by George Tiemann and Company of New York, were made of brass, lined with gold, and came in five different sizes. These were later supplanted by Annandale's rubber endotracheal tube. The method proved successful in relieving difficulty in breathing. In 1885, O'Dwyer presented his findings. According to Sperati and Felisanti, O'Dwyer's modifications in Bouchut's concept \\"were determinant\\". O'Dwyer's tubes of hard rubber or metal had rounded edges and were therefore, well tolerated. The O'Dwyer Method was first published in the N. Y. Medical Journal in 1888, as \\"Intubation of the Larynx\\". O'Dwyer's design was supported by Abraham Jacobi, the leading pediatrician at that time. O‚ÄôDwyer‚Äôs tubes and method was quickly adopted by American physicians and became the first widely used endotracheal technique. Before his death it was universally acknowledged that he had made the most important practical discovery of his generation. Use of O'Dwyer's intubation tubes required considerable practice. O'Dwyer wrote and spoke extensively to educate his fellow practitioners.O'Dwyer, Joseph P., \\"Intubation in Larygeal Stenosis caused by Diptheria\\", American Lancet, 1893 His tubes and the accompanying instruments for intubation and extubation, with his methods for the care of these patients, came to be employed throughout the medical world, gradually reducing the use of tracheotomy for croup, and thereby \\"leading to a significant reduction in the death rate\\". Bouchut and O'Dwyer met in Berlin in 1890 at the X International Congress of Medicine which focused on laryngeal intubation, and where both acknowledged the other's contribution to the development of the procedure. Afterwards O'Dwyer devoted himself to the study of pneumonia. In 1896 he served as president of the American Pediatric Society. He was also active at Presbyterian Hospital. The O'Dwyer method replaced tracheotomy until around 1895 when the development of antitoxins for diphtheria became more common.Gifford, Robert R. M., \\"The O'Dwyer Tube\\", Clinical Pediatrics, March 1970 When the development of antitoxins reduced the need for intubations, O'Dwyer was among the early practitioners to switch from intubation where appropriate. Death W.P. Northrup wrote, \\"Intubation is O'Dwyer's monument. It is equally true that it killed him.\\" By this Northrup refers to the fact that others rushed to adopt the still developing technique, resulting in a variety of negative results due in large part to their own inexperience. Correspondence from these untrained practitioners caused O'Dwyer a great deal of stress. \\"All the unhappy results all tales of misadventure, and all the unfavorable criticisms came directly to him.\\" Still grieving his late wife, O'Dwyer worried much and slept little. In December 1897 he developed symptoms of a diphtheria-related myocardiopathy, likely contracted while treating a young patient. He died on January 7, 1898. Known for his charities, Dr. O'Dwyer had declined to patent his invention, thereby sacrificing large pecuniary gains.Condon, Peter, Edward Devine, Daniel Moncrieff O'Connor, Andrew Hilliard Atteridge, and Thomas Meehan. \\"The Irish (in countries other than Ireland).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 14 March 2020 O'Dwyer did not make much money from the development of his intubation method and according to his friend Northrup, \\"died poor\\". The trustees of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons established the O'Dwyer Scholarship to provide for the education of his son and namesake, which then was allowed to lapse upon Joseph Jr.'s graduation.\\"The O'Dwyer Scholarship\\", Albany medical annals. Albany, N.Y., 1899 Family friends arranged for the education of his three other sons. Legacy His work at the Foundling Hospital helped greatly to make that institution one of the best of its kind. In private practice, O'Dwyer attended over 3,000 confinements, many of them in poor neighborhoods.Northrup, W. P., \\"Joseph O'Dwyer M.D.\\", Address before the J.C. Wilson Medical Society, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, February 19, 1904 O'Dwyer introduced the use of tubes in children with diphtheritic pseudomembranes in the larynx, to substantially increase their survival chances at a time when tracheotomy still had a high failure rate. The tubes proved of great value in stenosis of the larynx due to various other diseases and to strictures of the larynx, especially consequent on burns or scalds. Subsequent modifications further enhanced its application. The Fell-O'Dwyer apparatus supplied practical instrumentation for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The Fell-O'Dwyer Apparatus was widely used in cases of asphyxia, even in those caused by overdosage of anaesthetics. Some of his pioneering work anticipated methods of intensive care medicine.

Unlike other bands with a more ironic take on the lounge scene, Combustible Edison took the music seriously and strove to add to what its members saw as a canon of works by Esquivel, Henry Mancini and Martin Denny. Said Trouser Press, \\"As the band that poured the first shot in the Cocktail Revolution, this Boston-area combo brought lounge music into the '90s‚Äîor, more accurately, transported tastemakers back to the suburbia of the '50s‚Äîwith strikingly authentic interpretations of some of the most unauthentic sounds known to mankind.\\" The band ended in 1999. History Connecticut natives Liz Cox (drums, vocals) and Michael Cudahy (guitar, vocals) formed indie rock band Christmas in Boston in 1983. They issued three albums, In Excelsior Dayglo (1986), Ultra Prophets of Thee Psykick Revolution (1989) and Vortex (posthumously released in 1993). Cudahy's brother Nick was a member of the Christmas lineup for the second album. In 1991, Michael Cudahy ‚Äî now re- dubbed \\"The Millionaire\\" by fellow Providence bon vivant Robert Jaz ‚Äî wrote a stage show titled \\"The Tiki Wonder Hour\\", and formed the 14-piece Combustible Edison 'Heliotropic Oriental Mambo and Foxtrot Orchestra' to accompany the performance. After three performances of \\"Tiki Wonder Hour,\\" the orchestra shortened its name to Combustible Edison and slimmed down to five core members: Cox (renamed \\"Miss Lily Banquette\\", on vocals and various percussion instruments), The Millionaire (guitar), Nick Cudahy (bass), Mr. Peter Dixon (keyboards) and Aaron Oppenheimer (drums and percussion). Combustible Edison signed to Sub Pop Records and released their debut album, I, Swinger, in 1994. A live review by Los Angeles Times critic Chuck Crisafulli noted that the album \\"perfectly duplicates the '50s cool and hi-fi exotica of such lounge icons as Martin Denny\\", while Trouser Press said, \\"I, Swinger is a faithful replication of bargain-bin exotica, right down to a sleeve festooned with cocktail recipes and calculatedly dated hep-cat liner notes\\". The group performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 23, 1994. Around this time the band relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1995, the band recorded the soundtrack to the film Four Rooms, produced by Mark Mothersbaugh. \\"Vertigogo\\", the film's main theme, was submitted for consideration for an Academy Award, but was ultimately disqualified from consideration because of its incomprehensible lyrical content, despite the fact that the band submitted a lyric sheet with their best written approximation of the lyrics. The group's second studio album, Schizophonic! was issued in 1996. During this period, Dixon was replaced by keyboardist Robert \\"Brother Cleve\\" Toomey, a former WMBR DJ who was previously a member of the Swinging Erudites, the Del Fuegos, the Fabulous Billygoons, and Barrence Whitfield & the Savages. By the time of Combustible Edison's final album, The Impossible World (1998), drummer Michael \\"Laughing Boy\\" Connors had replaced Oppenheimer, and they had incorporated more modern electronic elements. The group split during the 1999 tour for The Impossible World. Other projects After Combustible Edison, Michael Cudahy helped build the internet radio station and music community site LuxuriaMusic, which launched in 1999. A cocktail enthusiast, Cudahy was credited with coining the term \\"Cocktail Nation\\" as well as the Combustible Edison cocktail. The recipe for the cocktail was featured on the back cover of Combustible Edison's debut album, and was later collected by Paul Harrington in his 1998 book Cocktail: The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century. Continuing to use his Millionaire moniker, Cudahy contributed three solo tracks to the 2003 compilation album Music to Lose Your Knickers By, and in 2004, he paired with Eric Bonerz to form Super Casanova, issuing the album Eternity Now. Cox sang the Lesley Gore-cowritten \\"My Secret Love\\" on the soundtrack for the 1996 film Grace of My Heart, and \\"Oahu\\" on the 6ths' 2000 album Hyacinths and Thistles. She is currently involved with Community MusicWorks, a community-based music education and performance organisation. Dixon released an instrumental solo album in 2007 titled Shady Planet. Toomey, an acclaimed DJ (including a current stint as DJ Sharaabi Kapoor), cocktail creator and bartender, later played and recorded with his group Brother Cleve and His Lush Orchestra, country band Wheelers & Dealers, and Miki Singh & Jetset (later renamed Dragonfly). Connors joined the Toomey-produced tiki music ensemble Waitiki in 2006, and also formed his own combo Funk House.

The film is a dark comedy that explores office culture and its effects and often uses surrealism to achieve its thematic goals. The film is set in Calgary, Alberta, where many downtown buildings are connected by the Plus 15, an extensive network of indoor skywalks. Because of this network, the hustle and bustle of the traditional \\"main street\\" has been replaced by recirculated air, food courts, and fluorescent lights. The result is a bleak and often humorous dark comedy about Canadian corporate culture.  Plot  The film centres on a group of office colleagues in downtown Calgary, Alberta, who bet a month's salary on who can last the longest without going outside by using the system of covered walkways that connect the buildings. The film takes place over one lunch hour on day 28 of the month-long competition. Things start to become complicated as the office prepares for the company founder's retirement party. The film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the (non- openable) window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through. In the movie, one of the characters has accumulated a 2-litre pop bottle full of marbles in the hopes of breaking his window. The dark joke for this is referenced in the film as: \\"a 15 bus takes you downtown, [but] a bottle of marbles takes you way downtown.\\" Cast *Fab Filippo as Tom Bennett *Don McKellar as Brad *Marya Delver as Sandra West *Gordon Currie as Curt Schwin *Jennifer Clement as Vicki *Tammy Isbell as Kathy *Tobias Godson as Randy *James McBurney as Phil Production The majority of the film was shot in TD Square, the Calgary Eaton Centre, and Bankers Hall.

Life The son of a postal official, Meissner studied law in Stra√üburg from 1898 to 1903, where he also became a member of the Stra√üburg Student Youth Fraternity (Burschenschaft) Germania. Later, he also studied in Berlin and earned his Doctor of Laws in 1908, at the age of 28, in Erlangen, Bavaria. Afterward, he became a bureaucrat for the national railroad, the Reichsbahn, in Stra√üburg. Between 1915 and 1917, he participated in the First World War in the 136th infantry regiment. Until 1919 he was more active behind the front as a military railroad official, first in Bucharest, then in Kiev. He was then accepted into the diplomatic service and from 1918 acted as a German charg√© d'affaires to the Ukrainian government in Kiev. Thanks to his good contacts, in 1919, Meissner became Acting Advisor in the \\"Bureau of the Reichspr√§sident\\", who was then the Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, and by 1 April 1920, Meissner had risen to Ministerial Director and Leader of the Bureau. Ebert raised Meissner to the rank of State Secretary (Staatssekret√§r) in November 1923. Meissner continued in that post under Ebert's successor, Paul von Hindenburg. When Hitler merged the functions of head of state (the president) and head of government (the chancellor) in August 1934, Meissner's office was renamed the \\"Presidential Chancellery\\" and restricted in its responsibilities to representative and formal matters of protocol, while all more political matters were assigned to the Reich Chancellery under the direction of Hans Lammers. On 1 December 1937, Meissner was promoted to Minister of State (Staatsminister) and Chief of the, now again re-named, \\"Presidential Chancellery of the F√ºhrer and Chancellor\\". He was now equal in rank to a Reichsminister. After the Second World War, Meissner was arrested by the Allies and interrogated as a witness during the Nuremberg Trials. In July 1947, he appeared as a character witness for the accused former State Secretary Franz Schlegelberger. Meissner was finally prosecuted in the Wilhelmstrasse Trial, but the court acquitted him on 14 April. Two years later, in May 1949, he was accused again, this time in Munich, and was adjudged a fellow traveler. His appeal was turned down, but the proceedings were called to a halt in January 1952. In 1950, Meissner published a memoir covering his unusual bureaucrat's career in a book, State Secretary under Ebert, Hindenburg and Hitler. The writer Hans-Otto Meissner (1909‚Äì1992) was his son. Role in history Meissner, who lived with his family in the palace of the German president between 1929 and 1939, undoubtedly enjoyed major influence upon the presidents, especially Hindenburg. Together with Kurt von Schleicher and a few others, Meissner, in 1929 and 1930, furthered the dissolution of the parliamentary system by means of a civil presidential cabinet. His role in the appointment of Hitler to chancellor from December 1932 to January 1933 remains a controversy among historians. As a member of the \\"camarilla\\", Meissner was certainly no small influence as State Secretary because of his close relations with Hindenburg. Together with Oskar von Hindenburg and Franz von Papen, Meissner organized the negotiations with Hitler to depose von Schleicher and to appoint Hitler to the post of Chancellor. For the Nazis' part, the talks were facilitated through Wilhelm Keppler, Joachim von Ribbentrop and the banker Kurt Freiherr von Schr√∂der, a former officer and head of the old-guard conservative \\"Herrenklub\\" (Gentlemen's club) in Berlin in which von Papen was also active. Neither Hitler nor Hindenburg, as of the end of 1932, would have initiated contact to each other, so great was their mutual distaste. Meissner submitted his resignation in 1933 but was turned down, and he assumed responsibility primarily for delegation duties. In 1937, the Nazi regime raised him to the rank of Staatssminister, with the title \\"Chief of the Presidential Chancellery of the F√ºhrer and Chancellor\\". However, politically, he never was a member of the Nazi Party and his influence in the Hitler regime was distinctly minor.  List of works  * Die Reichsverfassung.

Kingsley is most famous for his 1969 influential electronic instrumental composition \\"Popcorn\\". Kingsley conducted and arranged many Broadway musicals, and composed for film, television shows and commercials. His compositions were eclectic and vary between avant-garde and pop styles. Kingsley also composed classical chamber works, and his opera Raoul was premiered in Bremen, Germany in 2008. His work was recognized with a Tony Award nomination for Best Conductor and Musical Director, two Clio Awards for his work in advertising music, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Bob Moog Foundation. Kingsley died on December 10, 2019 at the age of 97 in Manhattan, New York.  Early life  Kingsley was born G√∂tz Gustav Ksinski in 1922 in Bochum, Weimar Republic, the son of Marie Christina, a homemaker, and Max Ksinski, a carpet dealer and pianist. His father was born Jewish and his mother, originally Catholic, converted to Judaism. He grew up in Berlin where his parents ran a large carpet shop. They had originally met in Essen, when his father, returning from Berlin on a business trip, had dropped in to a wine bar managed by two sisters, one of whom soon became Kingsley's mother. The elder Ksinski had spent the evening playing the piano in the bar, after which romance quickly blossomed. Kingsley became a member of a Zionist youth movement and at the age of 15 left Germany in 1938, a few days before Kristallnacht and joined kibbutz Ein Harod, Mandatory Palestine, while his parents stayed behind at that time. At the kibbutz he taught himself to play the piano. He joined the Hagana Jewish Settlement Police (Notrim) and also played jazz in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. He studied at the Jerusalem conservatory of music. His parents and brother had escaped to Cuba, from where, eventually, they succeeded in obtaining visas for the United States, where Kingsley met up with them eight years later.  Musical career  His career as a pop musician took off with the release of The In Sound from Way Out! album in 1966, which he recorded with Jean-Jacques Perrey. The Perrey and Kingsley duo went on to record Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out, released the next year, and subsequently went their separate ways. Kingsley then pursued a solo career recording Music to Moog By, released in 1969, a classic Moog album consisting mainly of cover songs, originally by The Beatles, Beethoven, and Simon and Garfunkel, but there also was original material, like his best known composition, Popcorn, which became his \\"signature song\\". His next musical effort was with a band called First Moog Quartet: they only recorded one album entitled First Moog Quartet, released in 1970, which consisted of live recordings from his nationwide tour featuring four Moog synthesizers. Some of these compositions are more experimental, featuring spoken word and beat poetry backed by synthetic noises and tones. Kingsley then moved beyond the Moog, and later pioneered the use of the earliest Fairlight and Synclavier digital synthesizers. = \\"Popcorn\\" = Many artists have covered \\"Popcorn\\", including Hot Butter, Aphex Twin, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, Marsheaux, Muse, Crazy Frog and The Muppets. The composition was used in the Soviet animated series Nu, pogodi!. Also particularly interesting is the cover version of the Italian pop group La Strana Societ√† from 1972, whose ensemble back then included Umberto Tozzi, who was still unknown at the time, but which would later achieve world fame with hits such as \\"Gloria\\", \\"Tu\\" and \\"Ti Amo\\". = Other notable works = Kingsley (with Perrey) is also credited with composing the song \\"Baroque Hoedown\\", released in their 1967 album, used by Walt Disney Productions for the Main Street Electrical Parade at its theme parks; and the song \\"The Savers\\", best known as the theme for the game show The Joker's Wild. He also wrote the logo sting (animated logo accompanied with music) for WGBH-TV in Boston, that appears throughout the United States on PBS programming produced by the station.

The majority of isolates have come from domestic cats exhibiting symptoms characteristically associated to rabies virus infection. There have been two reported cases of humans being infected with Mokola virus. Classification Mokola virus (MOKV) is a member of the genus Lyssavirus, which belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae. MOKV is one of four lyssaviruses found in Africa. The other three viruses are the classic rabies virus, Duvenhage virus and Lagos bat virus. Emergence Mokola virus was first isolated from Crocidura shrews collected in the Mokola forest, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria MOKV was first isolated in Nigeria, in 1968, from three shrews (Crocidura species) found in the Mokola forest, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The virus was shown to be morphologically and serologically related to rabies virus. Since the initial isolation of MOKV, the virus has been mainly isolated in domestic cats and small mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. There have been two recorded cases of human infection with MOKV, with both instances occurring in Nigeria. Both cases involved young Nigerian females. The first patient, who had been suffering from a fever and convulsions, recovered fully from infection. The second case, which occurred in 1972, involved a 6-year-old girl who had been suffering from drowsiness. The second patient ultimately suffered from paralysis and a terminal coma as a result of the MOKV infection. The origin of the MOKV in both human cases of MOKV infection remains unidentified. Genome and structure The MOKV genome consists of a non-segmented, single- stranded, negative-sense RNA molecule of 11,939 nucleotides in length. It is estimated that 90.3% of the MOKV genome consists of protein-encoding or signal-encoding sequences. The genome encodes five proteins: matrix protein M; transmembrane glycoprotein G; nucleoprotein N; phosphoprotein P; and the RNA- dependent RNA polymerase L. MOKV is an enveloped virus, with the envelope lined with spikes consisting of the viral protein G. MOKV exhibits the 'bullet-shaped' morphology that is characteristic of members of the Rhabdoviridae family. Evolution This virus appears to have evolved between 279 and 2,034 years before the present. Transmission The human cases of human MOKV infection have demonstrated the zoonotic potential of MOKV but as a natural reservoir has yet to be identified, transmission of the virus is poorly understood. Considering the MOKV isolates from small mammals and domestic cats; it has been suggested that small mammals, which are preyed upon by domestic cats, may be the natural MOKV reservoir. Unlike other lyssaviruses, MOKV is able to replicate inside mosquito cells in vitro, suggesting that insects may be implicated in MOKV transmission. Pathology Symptoms provoked by MOKV infection are similar to the symptoms associated with rabies virus infection, such as fever and headache. Ultimately, both MOKV and rabies virus infection can lead to death by encephalitis. The similarity between the symptoms associated with MOKV and rabies virus may be the reason why there are so few case records of MOKV infection, as MOKV infection might be falsely diagnosed as rabies virus infection. There is one significant difference between the symptoms observed in domestic cats infected with MOKV and those with rabies virus. MOKV-infected domestic cats do not demonstrate the unprovoked aggressive behaviour typically associated with rabies virus- infected mammals. Control At present, there is no medical or veterinary vaccine that protects against MOKV infection. It has long been established that, in spite of the relatedness between MOKV and rabies virus, immunisation with the rabies vaccine does not confer protection from MOKV infection. Isolation of MOKV from a number of domestic cats vaccinated with the rabies vaccine has demonstrated this. In order to neutralize rabies virus, the rabies vaccine targets the transmembrane glycoprotein G on the viral envelope. Variation in the amino acid sequences of the antigenic domain III within protein G between rabies virus and MOKV has rendered the rabies vaccine ineffective against MOKV infection.

Some remains of the church survive. History The priory was founded in c. 1190 by Robert Fitz-Henry, Lord of Lathom, for Augustinian canons. In 1390 the Lordship of the Manor and lands of Lathom passed to the Stanley family, several of whom were buried in the Priory, notably Sir Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley, K.G., of Lathom and Knowsley, in February 1459, his wife Joan in 1466, and their son Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.Richardson, Douglas, Magna Carta Ancestry, Baltimore, Md., 2007, p.771. The priory was dedicated to St. Nicholas. There was an associated leper hospital. Fitz-Henry endowed it with land in Burscough, the entire adjoining township of Marton, the chapel of St. Leonard of Knowsley, all the mills on his demesne, and the patronage of three parish churches‚Äîat Ormskirk, Huyton, and Flixton. The ownership of Flixton however proved problematic. From the 1330s until the dissolution, the vicar of Ormskirk was always one of the canons of the priory. A Royal Charter that was granted by Edward I of England in 1286 to the monks at Burscough Priory permitted a regular market nearby in Ormskirk. As a priory with an income of less than ¬£200, it was dissolved under the act of February 1536. At the time of its surrender the religious community consisted of only five canons, including the prior. The Earl of Derby made attempts to save the church, in which many of his family had been buried, but they came to nothing. Following the dissolution eight bells from the Priory were moved to Ormskirk Parish Church, where a tower had to be built specially, as the existing steeple could not support them. The remaining bells were removed to Croston church. The tenor bell at the Ormskirk Church (the third bell from the Priory) has a Latin inscription which translates as \\"J.S. de Burscough, Esq., and E. my wife, made [this bell] in honour of the Trinity. R.B. 1497\\". It also bears the symbols of the rose, portcullis and Fleur-de-lis which suggests that the bell was presented in honour of a visit from Henry VII as these were some of his favourite badges. The Priory gives its name to the local high school, the Burscough Priory Academy, until recently known as the Burscough Priory Science College. The school has an enrolment of around 750 pupils of ages 11‚Äì16 years.

On the south side of the nave was a cloister square. The seal used on the surrender deed of the priory shows a view of the monastic buildings. The parts still standing above ground consist of the two piers which originally supported the north side of the crossing tower of the church. They survive to some height above the springing of the crossing arches, although the voussoirs of the arches themselves have been removed. There are fragmentary walls projecting from the eastern pier to the north and east, while the other incorporates a small trefoil-headed recess or aumbry. These remains probably date from the late 13th century.

The Registry maintained by The Jockey Club, called the American Stud Book, dates back to the club's founding and contains the descendants of those horses listed, as well as horses imported into North America up to the present. Participants in the Registry program agree to allow the Registry to conduct genetic testing to verify parentage as well as arbitrating any disputes between owners. The Jockey Club has taken the position that it will not allow cloned Thoroughbreds to be registered in the American Stud Book, making it impossible for such horses to compete in most races. The Club has consistently prohibited artificial insemination throughout its history, only allowing the registration of horses born through \\"natural\\" procreation. Naming of foals is also controlled by The Jockey Club and includes a number of conventions. Names may not consist of more than 18 letters (with spaces and punctuation marks counting as letters), contain initials such as C.O.D., F.O.B., etc., or end in \\"filly,\\" \\"colt,\\" \\"stud,\\" \\"mare,\\" \\"stallion,\\" or any similar horse-related term. Names may also not end with a numerical designation such as \\"2nd\\" or \\"3rd,\\" whether or not such a designation is spelled out. Names of persons may not be used unless written permission to use their names is on file (examples of such permission are actor Jack Klugman, whose namesake competed in the Kentucky Derby, and tennis star Chris Evert, whose namesake is in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame). The names of \\"notorious\\" people may never be used, nor can namesakes of racetracks, races, or stable names. Trademarks and copyrighted names are similarly not allowed as are vulgar, obscene or offensive ones. The list also protects names of currently active horses as well as horses enrolled in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame or other well-known horses, including winners of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup or Breeders' Cup events. =Charities= Created in 1984, The Jockey Club Research Foundation was joined along with the Grayson Foundation, established in 1940 by George D. Widener, Jr., William Woodward, Sr. and John Hay Whitney, amongst others. It is now known as the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation Inc. The Grayson- Jockey Club Research Foundation is the nation‚Äôs leading source of equine research funding and it helps all breeds. The Jockey Club Safety Net Foundation is a charitable trust that provides, on a confidential basis, financial relief and assistance to needy members of the Thoroughbred industry and their families. Assistance includes financial aid, medication, surgical and hospital costs, therapeutic equipment, voice-recognition computers for quadriplegics and wheelchair-accessible vans, among other needs. =NTRA= The Jockey Club formed the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) in 1998 with the Breeders' Cup Limited, Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, Keeneland Association, Oak Tree Racing Association and the National Thoroughbred Association. The Jockey Club maintains a seat on the Board of Directors of the NTRA. Breeding Bureau Believing the Thoroughbred was the best breed of horse and could pass on its superior traits to other breeds, in 1906 The Jockey Club of New York established the Breeding Bureau. Its purpose was to provide Thoroughbred stallions as sires that would produce a variety of top quality half-breed general purpose horses. During World War I, the Breeding Bureau expanded the part of the program which had been providing horses for the United States Army Cavalry Remount Service. Some of the prominent Thoroughbred runners who were donated to the Cavalry Remount Service include: * Gold Heels - winner of the 1902 Suburban Handicap * Sir Huon - winner of the 1906 Latonia and Kentucky Derbys; * George Smith - winner of the 1916 Kentucky Derby; * Behave Yourself - winner of the 1921 Kentucky Derby; * Hurryoff - winner of the 1933 Belmont Stakes. Experimental Free Handicap Since 1933, the Jockey Club has compiled the Experimental Free Handicap, a weight-based assessment of the previous year's 2-year-olds based on a theoretical race at a distance of 1 1/16 miles.

It is named after Big Ben, the colloquially used nickname for the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. Rules Before the start of the game, the following cards are separated from the decks: , , , , , , , , , , , . These cards are used to form a circle arranged like numbers on a clock face with the on the \\"9 o' clock\\" position, the at the \\"12 o' clock\\" position, and the at the \\"8 o' clock.\\" This will be the foundations, or the \\"inner circle\\" (otherwise known as the \\"clock\\"). Twelve piles of three cards are then dealt around the inner circle. These piles form the tableau, or the \\"outer circle.\\" The top cards of the outer circle are available for play to the inner circle or around the outer circle. Building on the outer circle is down by suit, while the foundations in the inner circle are built up by suit until the last card corresponds to its position on the clock (i.e. the should be built up to , for instance). Building is also continuous, with Aces placed over Kings in the inner circle and vice versa in the outer circle. The minimum number of cards in each pile in the outer circle is three. A pile containing less than three cards is said to have gaps; an empty pile has three \\"gaps,\\" a pile having one card has two \\"gaps,\\" and a pile with two cards has one \\"gap.\\" As cards are built, \\"gaps\\" are formed and the only way these are \\"filled\\" is by dealing cards from the stock. Building on a pile having cards less than three is like \\"filling a gap\\" from the tableau and is therefore not allowed. It is the player's discretion when to fill the \\"gaps,\\" but when the player decides to do so, one has to fill all \\"gaps,\\" i. e. replenish all piles with less than three cards so each of them contains three cards once again. For example, two piles are empty, one pile has one card left, and two piles have two cards left. So the player has to fill a total of 10 gaps. He does this by dealing cards one card per pile at a time clockwise starting from the pile above the \\"12 o' clock\\" foundation. No building is done until this process is complete. The player can do this as long as there are \\"gaps.\\" Sometimes, the player cannot make any moves even when all piles contain three cards each. So the player can deal cards from the stock one at a time. Cards that cannot be built either onto the inner or outer circles are placed on the wastepile (as a suggestion, one can place the waste pile at the center of the inner circle for convenience). Again, cards at the wastepile cannot be used to fill \\"gaps.\\" But once the stock is exhausted, there are no re-deals; the game ends sooner after this or later. The game is won when all foundations show cards corresponding to their positions in the clock ( on \\"11 o' clock,\\" on \\"12 o' clock,\\" on \\"1 o' clock,\\" and so on.)

Often known by his nom de guerre Argala (Slim), he took part in the so called Operation Ogre, which consisted in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco, Spain's Prime Minister, in 1973. Five years later, he was in turn assassinated by a car bomb in Anglet, French Basque Country by a group directed by far right members inside the Spanish Navy (including an official of the SECED secret service and another of the Naval military intelligence agency, Servicio de Inteligencia Naval and the other belonging to the Alto Estado Mayor). This group reportedly received assistance from people such as former OAS member Jean Pierre Cherid, former Triple A Argentine member Jos√© Mar√≠a Boccardo and Italian neofascist Mario Ricci, member of Avanguardia Nazionale.¬´Yo mat√© al asesino de Carrero Blanco¬ª, El Mundo, December 21, 2003 (English account of El Mundo article)  Early life  Be√±aran was born in Arrigorriaga, in Biscay, close to the industrialized city of Bilbao, but not far from Arratia, a valley with a typical Basque style of life. His mother, Felicidad Orde√±ana Uriarte, was from Arantzazu. She was a Basque speaker, but only spoke Spanish at home. His father Pablo Be√±aran Ormazabal was from Arrigorriaga. Though his father was a Basque nationalist, he could not speak Basque, even though his father was a Basque speaker. They had four children: Jose Miguel (1949), Maite (1951), I√±aki (1952) and Pablo (1955). Be√±aran grew up in two very different environments: the Francoist schools he was educated in and his Basque nationalist home. Workers strikes and police repression in the mid-1960s contributed to his concerns about the class system. He began studying Marxist theories at a young age. As Basque nationalism and cultural awareness grew stronger in the 1960s Be√±aran enthusiastically participated in Basque language schools, festivals, and other cultural activities. In 1968, he joined the separatist group ETA with some friends. He began studying engineering, but he quit before finishing his studies and began working in a bank. He then began studying human sciences. In May 1970, at the age of 21, Be√±aran was forced to escape when the police noticed his involvement in ETA activities. He was reluctant to do so as both his parents were ill, with his father eventually dying that same year. He went to O√±ati and a family gave him shelter there. He then took the nickname I√±aki, living in various locations over the next few years.  Underground activity with ETA  In 1969, almost all of ETA's directorate board were arrested in Bilbao and Cantabria, and different discussions began inside the organization. At a subsequent meeting held in Itsasu, the organization split into three different groups: ETA V, ETA VI and Celulas Rojas. At that time, Argala was member of the organization's cultural branch, the Cultural Front. He did not attend the meeting held in Itsasu, the Itsasu Assembly, and at first he remained with the Cultural Front within ETA VI. In December 1970, the took place. On December 2, ETA V kidnapped the German consul, Behil in Donostia. ETA VI then organized Operaci√≥n Botella, an operation to break out prisoners. Argala joined the operation, which involved digging tunnels into the prison. While the tunnels managed to reach under the building, they failed to succeed, as they failed to break the prison walls. Argala joined ETA V in January 1971. They were a small group that made their ideology very clear. Argala helped militants like Txomin Iturbe and Eustakio Mendizabal build a theory based on Marxist theories,Argala: Political autobiography while stressing Basque national values. He spent some time in Paris undertaking organizing tasks and then he went back to Biscay as leader of the Cultural Front. He divided his life between the towns of Eibar and Elgoibar. However, the fact that he was involved in the Cultural Front did not keep him from taking part in the Military Front. On 30 September 1971, he participated in the assault of Banco de Vizcaya together with Eustakio Mendizabal and some other members, getting away with 10 million pesetas. In 1971, ETA began setting up hideouts in Madrid, where they could contact some other left-wing groups, with a view to establishing an anonymous and safe rearguard and creating a local armed cell in Madrid. Argala made many trips to the Francoist state's capital. They shelved the idea of creating a local armed group in the short term, and instead began to consider staging attacks themselves in Madrid. It was here that Argala made his first contacts with Alfonso Sastre and . Further actions On 19 January 1972, an ETA group formed by Txomin Iturbe, Mikel Lujua, Tomas Perez Revilla and Argala kidnapped the businessman Lorenzo Zabala Suinaga in Abadi√±o, Biscay. The workers of the company Precicontrol were on strike, with some of them, including some friends of Argala, on a hunger strike in the church of Eibar. ETA wanted to support labour conditions and turned their attention to the workers' demands. They declared that if the company's management didn't meet their workers' demands, they would kill Zabala on 28 January. The demands were satisfied and Zabala was freed on 22 January. In October 1972, ETA V organized an assembly to clarify each faction's position and to try to reunite them as a single organization. The meeting was meant to be in Hasparren, in the Northern Basque Country. Argala and some other members of the Cultural Front, decided not to cross the Spanish-French border out of concern for their own safety. The Guardia Civil had spotted the group Argala was supposed to join and opened fire on them. Jonan Aranguren, known as Iharra, was killed, but the rest of the group managed to escape. Missing a meeting was considered a breach of discipline, so Argala and Ignacio P√©rez Beotegui, known as \\"Wilson\\" were stripped of all responsibilities in the organization. The assembly issued a ban on both militants from setting foot in Southern Basque Country or from undertaking any politically related work. As a result of this ban, Argala and Wilson were forced to relocate to Madrid. They obtained information about Luis Carrero Blanco, planning to kidnap him in exchange for the freedom of all imprisoned Basque activists. More militants joined them in Madrid and by May 1973 plans were complete to carry out the kidnapping. Due to various problems, the kidnapping was delayed. Later on the ETA member Eustakio Mendizabal, aka \\"Txikia\\", was killed in Algorta, forcing the organization's directorate to delay the abduction. From that moment on, the Madrid group was called the Commando Txikia. Carrero Blanco was appointed prime minister of the Spanish government and undertook more security measures. With the difficulties in kidnapping Carrero Blanco Argala's group tried to kidnap the Secretary of Trade Alberto Ullastres, but he was away when a cell formed by ETA members came up in his house on 7 November. Argala and his group began plotting to kill Carrero Blanco instead, in what would be known as Operaci√≥n Ogro. The Commando Txikia also considered other options: killing Manuel Fraga, killing Alfredo Sempr√∫n and breaching the walls of the Segovia prison to break out anti-Franco prisoners. On 25 September, they attacked a government arms store to obtain explosives, scattering propaganda of an invented revolutionary group as a distraction. On 20 December 1973, posing as workmen, members the cell triggered the bomb that went off in a tunnel under the Madrid street as the car of Carrero Blanco passed by on his way home from Mass. Franco's right-hand man initially survived the attack, though he later died in hospital, while his chauffeur and bodyguard were also killed. Argala was the only ETA member able to identify the mysterious man who gave Carrero Blanco's schedule and itinerary to ETA.  Assassination  He was arrested several times in the French Basque Country between 1975 and 1977, and confined to different French regions by French authorities. However, he was released and by 1978 he lived in Anglet. By then Argala was a charismatic leader of ETA (m), with the PNV historic figure Telesforo Monzon calling him in the Txiberta talks, where a possible Basque nationalist collaboration was discussed and eventually ruled out. However, the Spanish home office was targeting him and tracked him down, as declared by mercenaries who were being used to execute the Government's policy in the French Basque Country. Argala was assassinated by a car bomb on 21 December 1978 in the town of Anglet, in the French Basque Country. According to \\"Leonidas\\", a former member of the Spanish Army involved in the bombing against Argala, \\"the explosives came from a North American base. I don't remember exactly whether they were from Torrej√≥n de Ardoz or Rota, but I do know that the Americans did not know what they would be used for. It was a personal favor to Pedro el Marino\\" (referring to Pedro Mart√≠nez, who provided the explosives). The device was planted by a Guardia Civil captain. Responsibility for Argala's assassination was claimed by the Batall√≥n Vasco Espa√±ol (BVE). According to Leonidas, however, \\"BVE, ATE and Triple A are only acronyms\\", used to suit each situation.

It was based upon Bruce Chatwin's 1980 novel The Viceroy of Ouidah. The film depicts the life of a fictional slave trader. It was filmed on location in Brazil, Colombia and Ghana. Plot In 1880s, Francisco Manoel da Silva (Klaus Kinski) is a debauched Brazilian rancher who has reluctantly gone to work at a gold mining company after his ranch is ruined by drought. When he discovers that he is being financially exploited, he murders his boss and goes on the lam to pursue a career as an outlaw. He becomes the notorious Cobra Verde (Green Snake), the most vicious bandit of the sert√£o. In a visit to town, da Silva encounters and subdues by force of character an escaping slave, an act that impresses wealthy sugar baron Dom Oct√°vio Coutinho (Jos√© Lewgoy). Dom Coutinho, unaware that he is dealing with the legendary bandit, hires da Silva to oversee the slaves on his sugar plantation. When da Silva subsequently impregnates all three of the Dom's daughters, the sugar baron is furious, but the situation becomes even more complicated when he discovers that da Silva is none other than the infamous Cobra Verde. As punishment, rather than kill him or have him prosecuted, Dom Coutinho decides to send da Silva on the impossible mission of re-opening the slave trade with Western Africa. The bandit is aware he is likely to be killed in Africa, but accepts anyway. He travels by sea to Dahomey, West Africa (present-day Benin), where he must negotiate with the fearsome King Bossa Ahadee of Dahomey (played by His Honour the Omanhene Nana Agyefi Kwame II of Nsein, a village north of the city of Axim, Ghana). Amazingly, da Silva succeeds in convincing the King to exchange slaves for new rifles. He takes over Elmina Castle and takes Taparica (King Ampaw), sole survivor of the previous expedition, for a partner. They begin operating the slave trade across the Atlantic to Brazil. Soon, however, the fickle king has them captured and brought before him. The King accuses da Silva of various crimes that he has no knowledge of, including poisoning the King's greyhound, and sentences him to death. He and Taparica are rescued the night prior to da Silva's decapitation by the King's nephew, who negotiates a blood alliance with da Silva, planning to overthrow the King. The ambitious bandit trains an enormous army of native women, and leads them on a raid to successfully overthrow King Bossa. Against all expectations, the slave trade is successfully maintained under the new King, thanks to da Silva's resourcefulness. However, da Silva eventually falls out of favour with the new King, and discovers that in the meantime the Portuguese have outlawed slavery and seized his assets, and the English have placed a price on his head. Despite the adversity, da Silva is glad that finally a change has come. The exhausted bandit tries desperately to take a boat to water, but despite his best efforts, he is unable to accomplish the task. He collapses next to the ship as the tide slowly laps in. The film ends with the image of an African man stricken with polio walking along the shore, and a group of young native women laughingly chant over the credits.  Cast  * Klaus Kinski - Francisco Manoel da Silva * King Ampaw - Taparica * Jos√© Lewgoy - Don Octavio Coutinho * Salvatore Basile - Captain Fraternidade * Peter Berling - Bernab√© Production The film was shot in Ghana, Brazil and Colombia. Herzog showed Kinski photographs of the places where he would like to work. Kinski was interested in some landscapes in Colombia, but Herzog did not agree. However, Kinski made the trip with a group of friends to some remote places that fascinated him: the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Cape of the Sailing, on the peninsula of La Guajira, Colombia. Herzog finally decided on Villa de Leyva and Valle del Cauca, in the South American country. Kinski said then: \\"Herzog does not know that I give life to the dead scenery\\". The film was based upon Bruce Chatwin's 1980 novel The Viceroy of Ouidah, which was itself based on the Brazilian slave trader Francisco F√©lix de Sousa and his role in helping King Ghezo overthrow his brother Adandozan as King of Dahomey with the help of Ghezo's Dahomey Amazons. Tension between Herzog and Kinski Cobra Verde was the last film that Werner Herzog would make with Klaus Kinski. Their now-legendary personality conflict peaked during the film. The film's production was especially affected by Kinski's fiery outbursts. The cast and crew were continually plagued by Kinski's wrath, most famously culminating in the film's original cinematographer Thomas Mauch walking out on the project after a perpetual torrent of verbal abuse from Kinski. Herzog was forced to replace Mauch with Viktor R≈Ø≈æiƒçka.DVD Verdict Review - Cobra Verde Herzog's opinions of Kinski are deeply explored in his 1999 documentary retrospective, My Best Fiend, where he examines their unique friendship, the associated hatred, and the legacy that both qualities were responsible for. The filming of Cobra Verde and relationship of Herzog and Kinski was also the subject of a 1987 Swiss documentary film, Location Africa.

With support from members of the city council, he developed Eagles Court in 1998 in response to a 1997 Monday Night Football game between the Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. With over 60 fistfights reported at the nationally televised game, stadium violence became an embarrassment for the city. McCaffery presided over the court, which was convened in the basement of Veterans Stadium, and handed out fines or jail time to fans arrested during games. Prior to protests at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, McCaffery announced a plan for the preventive detention of protesters. Because of this, defense attorneys asked him to recuse himself from trials involving the protests, but he refused, without hearing the arguments. He was elected to the Superior Court in 2003Commonwealth of PA - Elections Information and successfully ran for the Supreme Court in 2007, where he was a landslide winner attaining over 2 million votes statewide. Resignation McCaffery abruptly resigned from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on October 27, 2014, one week after his October 20, 2014 suspension by four fellow Justices and the public disclosure by Chief Justice Ronald Castille that Justice McCaffery had sent or received 234 emails containing pornography between late 2008 and May 2012 to an agent in the attorney general's office. The Chief Justice had requested copies of the emails from Attorney General Kathleen Kane. A fellow justice, Michael Eakin, (who abstained from the suspension vote) also had gone public with an accusation he filed on October 17, 2014, that Justice McCaffery tried to coerce him into taking his side against Chief Justice Castille. The justices voting to suspend McCaffery cited King's Bench power to \\"protect and preserve the integrity\\" of the state's judicial system. The justices, in their order suspending McCaffery, directed the state Judicial Conduct Board, which was already investigating McCaffery, to determine within 30 days whether there was \\"probable cause to file formal misconduct charges\\" against him. The court said McCaffery may also have allowed his wife, who was his chief legal clerk, to collect legal referral fees while she was a state court employee, and he may have tried to fix a traffic ticket for her. In his concurring statement on the suspension, Chief Justice Castille described McCaffery as exhibiting the traits of a sociopath. The Supreme Court confirmed McCaffery's resignation in an order lifting his suspension. McCaffery's retirement agreement not to seek senior judge status and not seek future judicial positions ended the state Judicial Conduct Board investigation of him. By retiring instead of being impeached, McCaffery was able to keep an $11,000 per month retirement benefit ($134,000 annual pension) from the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) paid for by Pennsylvania taxpayers, even after he cashed out $455,000 of his own contributions plus interest.

Contemporary Mayanism places less emphasis on contacts between the ancient Maya and lost lands than in the work of early writers such as Godfrey Higgins, Charles √âtienne Brasseur de Bourbourg and Augustus Le Plongeon, alluding instead to possible contacts with extraterrestrial life. However, it continues to include references to Atlantis. Notions about extraterrestrial influence on the Maya can be traced to the book Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von D√§niken, whose ancient astronaut theories were in turn influenced by the work of Peter Kolosimo and especially the team of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, authors of Le Matin des magiciens. These latter writers were inspired by the fantasy literature of H. P. LovecraftColavito 2005 and publications by Charles Fort. However, there remain elements of fascination with lost continents and lost civilizations, especially as popularized by 19th century science fiction and speculative fiction by authors such as Jules Verne, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and H. Rider Haggard. Mayanism experienced a revival in the 1970s through the work of Frank Waters, a writer on the subject of Hopi mythology. His Book of the Hopi is rejected \\"as largely ersatz by Hopi traditionalists\\". In 1970, Waters was the recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation grant to support research in Mexico and Central America. This resulted in his 1975 book Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness, a discussion of Mesoamerican culture strongly colored by Waters' beliefs in astrology, prophecy, and the lost continent of Atlantis. It has gained new momentum in the context of the 2012 phenomenon, especially as presented in the work of New Age author John Major Jenkins, who asserts that Mayanism is \\"the essential core ideas or teachings of Maya religion and philosophy\\" in his 2009 book The 2012 Story: The Myths, Fallacies, and Truth Behind the Most Intriguing Date in History. Mayanism has gained renewed vigor due to pseudoscientific nonfiction by authors such as Erich von D√§niken, Zecharia Sitchin, and Graham Hancock, whose theories range from invoking ancient astronauts and other extraterrestrials from outer space to revivals of the idea that ancient peoples from lost lands brought wisdom and technology to the Mayas. The implication of this is that the Mayas had access to aspects of ancient knowledge, spiritualism, philosophy, and religion that are useful for coping with the modern world, whether by avoiding Armageddon, embracing a mystical Apocalypse, or constructing a future Utopia. Mayanism has a complex history that draws from many different sources on the fringes of mainstream archaeology. It has gained growing attention through its influence on popular culture through pulp fiction, science fiction, fantasy literature, and more recently cinema, graphic novels, fantasy role-playing games (especially Dungeons & Dragons), and video games. It has also drawn inspiration from the success of The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield, a novel that refers to the fictional discovery of a Pre-Columbian self-help manuscript in South America. Mayanism has been promoted by specific publishing houses, most notably Inner Traditions - Bear & Company, which has produced a number of books on the theme of 2012 by authors such as Jos√© Arg√ºelles, John Major Jenkins, Carl Johan Calleman, and Barbara Hand Clow. Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc. has published works by New Age authors Daniel Pinchbeck and John Major Jenkins that have further contributed to a growing interest in Mayanism. History Mayanism can be traced to sources such as the sixteenth-century book Utopia by Thomas More, who developed the concept of a utopia in the New World (an idea first explored by Christopher Columbus in his 1501 Book of Prophecies). During the eighteenth century, speculations about the origins of ancient Maya civilization sought to associate Maya history with Biblical stories of Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. This included speculation about legendary culture heroes such as Votan and Quetzalcoatl. In the early nineteenth century, Alexander von Humboldt and Lord Kingsborough contributed further to such speculation. Humboldt and Kingsborough were in turn cited by Godfrey Higgins, whose Anacalypsis (1833) contributed to the emergence of perennial philosophy and claims that all religions had a common, ancient origin in a Golden Age of the distant past.Hoopes 2011aHoopes 2011b In the late nineteenth-century, Charles √âtienne Brasseur de Bourbourg made significant academic contributions (including re-discovery of the Popol Vuh), but towards the end of his career became convinced that the ancient Maya culture could be traced to the lost continent of Atlantis. For example, in 1857 Brasseur identified Votan as a Phoenician ruler who founded Palenque and in an article published in 1872 attributed mythological Mesoamerican cataclysms to an early version of pole shift theory. Brasseur's work, some of which was illustrated by the talented but very inaccurate Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Waldeck, influenced other works of pseudoscience and pseudohistory, such as the research of D√©sir√© Charnay, Augustus Le Plongeon, Ignatius L. Donnelly, and James Churchward. Le Plongeon and Donnelly in turn influenced the work of writers such as Madame Blavatsky Originally published in who brought misconceptions about the ancient Maya into early New Age circles. These ideas became part of a belief system fostered by psychic Edgar Cayce in the early twentieth century and later popularized in the 1960s by author Jess Stearn. One example of early Mayanism is the creation of a group called the Mayan Temple by Harold D. Emerson of Brooklyn, a self-proclaimed Maya priest who edited a serial publication titled The Mayan, Devoted to Spiritual Enlightenment and Scientific Religion between 1933 and 1941. Attempts at a synthesis of religion and science, a common theme in Mayanism, are one of the contributions from Theosophy while Emerson would be an early example of a plastic shaman in Mayanism. Basic beliefs Mayanism has no central doctrine. However, a basic premise is that the ancient Maya understood aspects of the human experience and human consciousness that remain poorly understood in modern Western culture. This includes insights into cosmology and eschatology as well as lost knowledge of advanced technology and ecology that, when known, can be used to improve the human condition and create a future Utopia. However, as a New Age belief system, Mayanism scorns academic scholarship, giving preference to knowledge gained through revelation and prophecy and to traditional knowledge. The beliefs of Mayanism tend to be characterized by a combination of esotericism and syncretism, rather than being the result of either formal controlled field research or detailed scholarly research that has been based on a broad range of primary sources. December 21, 2012 The significance of this date in Mayanism stems from the ending of the current baktun cycle of the Maya calendar in 2012, which many believed would create a global \\"consciousness shift\\" and the beginning of a new age. This has come to be known as the 2012 phenomenon. Speculation about this date can be traced to the first edition of The Maya (1966) by Michael D. Coe, in which he suggested the date of December 24, 2011 as one on which the Maya believed \\"Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation.\\". This date became the subject of speculation by Frank Waters, who devotes two chapters to its interpretation, including discussion of an astrological chart for this date and its association with Hopi prophecies in Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness (1975). The significance of the year 2012 (but not a specific day) was mentioned briefly by Jos√© Arg√ºelles in The Transformative Vision: Reflections on the Nature and History of Human Expression (1975) and (without reference to the ancient Maya) by Terence McKenna and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching (1975). Waters' book inspired further speculation in the mid-1980s, including revision of the date by the McKennas, Arg√ºelles, and John Major Jenkins to one corresponding with the winter solstice in 2012. Interpretations of the date became the subject of further speculation by Jos√© Arg√ºelles in The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology (1987), promoted for the 1987 Harmonic Convergence. It received further elaboration in the Novelty theory of Terence McKenna. The supposed prediction of an astronomical conjunction of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy with the winter solstice Sun on December 21, 2012, referred to by Jenkins in Maya Cosmogenesis 2012: The True Meaning of the Maya Calendar End-Date (1998) and Galactic Alignment:The Transformation of Consciousness According to Mayan, Egyptian, and Vedic Traditions (2002) as having been predicted by the ancient Maya and others, is a much-anticipated event in Mayanism. Although Jenkins suggests that ancient Maya knowledge of this event was based on observations of the \\"dark rift\\" in the Milky Way as seen from Earth (this dark rift, it is said by some Mayan scholars, was believed by some Mayans to be one of the entrances to Xibalba), others see it as evidence of knowledge imparted via ancient contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. The relevance of modern \\"dark rift\\" observations to Pre- Columbian and traditional Maya beliefs is strongly debated, and academic archaeologists reject all theories regarding extraterrestrial contact, but it is clear that the promotion of Mayanism through interest in 2012 is contributing to the evolution of religious syncretism in contemporary Maya communities. Psychonaut author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date, linking it to beliefs about crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of entheogens and mediumship in his 2006 book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl. Carl Johan Calleman differs in that he sees 28 October 2011 and not 21 December 2012 as the pivotal end date. Calleman does not see the date as an apocalypse but a slow transformation of consciousness with people beginning to experience a higher 'unity consciousness'. Mayanism, shamanism, and \\"Toltecs\\" Shamanism has become a significant component of Mayanism, in part due to the scholarly interpretation of ancient Maya rulers as shamans and the popularity of Carlos Castaneda, whose books described his apprenticeship to a Yaqui sorcerer. However, Castaneda's work is seen as being fictional, inaccurate, misleading, and plagiaristic, and there is substantial evidence to support the interpretation that both \\"Carlos\\" (a character in Castaneda's books) and don Juan (the sorcerer) are fictional creations. Although the Yaqui are indigenous to the Sonoran Desert region of northern Mexico and southern Arizona, far from the Maya region, Mayanism often conflates the concept of Toltec (Castaneda) with the Toltec who interacted with the ancient Maya. This stems from 19th century speculations by Brasseur and Charnay about the Toltecs as a white, Aryan race that brought advanced civilization to the Americas either through a migration from Asia across the Bering Strait (according to Charnay) or emigration from the lost continent of Atlantis (according to Brasseur).

Biography He was raised in Frost, Texas, roughly 50 miles south of Dallas, until the age of 13. After his parents were divorced, his mother remarried and moved the family to the Pacific Northwest in 1991, where he attended Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington. Alienated by his southern roots, the isolation led him to focus all of his attention on learning to play guitar and writing songs. Inspired by seeing many punk shows including bands like Jawbreaker and Fugazi, he started several different musical projects while in high school. When his former band Lying on Loot disbanded in 1996, Votolato, along with friends Rudy Gajadhar (drums) and Andrew Hartley (bass), started playing under the name Waxwing. His younger brother Cody (The Blood Brothers) soon joined the band on second guitar, and the band recorded their debut 7\\" for Henry's Finest Recordings. In 1999, Second Nature Recordings released their first full-length, entitled For Madmen Only. Blending straight-up rock with elements of post-hardcore, and Cody's metal reminiscent guitaring, Waxwing soon established a strong local following. The band then signed with Second Nature Recordings out of Kansas City, MO. The band then released three full-length albums: For Madmen Only in 1999, One for the Ride in 2000, and Nobody Can Take What Everybody Owns in 2002. By this time, the band's profile in the Seattle music scene had grown substantially, causing them to consistently sell out at local clubs like the Crocodile Cafe and The Paradox Theater. In 1999, Votolato branched out from his work with Waxwing, having written a handful of songs which did not really fit in with their more aggressive, fast-tempo style. Along the way he has toured with the likes of Damien Jurado, Small Brown Bike, The Get Up Kids, The New Amsterdams, Owen and The Casket Lottery, members of the latter having provided assistance as backing musicians on occasion. His studio albums have also been littered with appearances from some of Seattle's finest musicians (including players in the bands Red Stars Theory, Sharks Keep Moving, The Blood Brothers, Death Cab for Cutie, and Pedro the Lion, and Sub Pop solo artist Rosie Thomas). On the production side, Votolato has worked with Matt Bayles (Pearl Jam, Botch, Murder City Devils, Hayden) and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie). It is a creative input which has helped see Votolato progress stylistically with every release, from his low-key self-titled album released in 1999 - all pretty much recorded live - right through to his recent, alt-country, folk-esque offering, Makers. A video was shot for the first track of Makers, \\"White Daisy Passing\\" - a song which also appeared on an episode of the popular TV show The OC. Votolato also starred in the film The Edge of Quarrel, which he worked on with Dave Larson from Excursion Records. It also includes members of the Murder City Devils and Botch, and is about a gang war between straightedgers and punk rockers and his attempts to achieve peace between the two opposing groups. He has been married to his wife, April Votolato, for over 10 years, and they live in Seattle with their two children.

Three years after, Upper Deck became licensor for the O-Pee-Chee brand, having released sets up to present.  History = Beginning = The O-Pee-Chee Gum Company got its start in 1911 when brothers John McKinnon (J.K.) McDermid and Duncan Hugh (D.H.) McDermid started to manufacture chewing gum. According to O-Pee-Chee literature, both brothers had been in the gum business and knew the business very well. The brothers had worked for C.R. Somerville, a gum manufacturing plant in London, Ontario. After the Somerville firm was sold to American Chicle Company in 1908 and the plant moved to Toronto, the McDermid brothers took over the box division and eventually purchased it in 1910 (Somerville Paper Box Limited). Shortly thereafter, they started O-Pee-Chee and produced their first box of Gipsy gum. The name O-Pee-Chee is an Ojibwe word meaning \\"the Robin\\" as is found in The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It also happened to be the name of McDermid's summer cottage in Grand Bend Ontario. O-Pee-Chee main building in London, Ontario. It was used until 1989 when a new plant was built in London East In terms of company genealogy, the McDermids owned the O-Pee-Chee Company Limited (as renamed in 1921) and Somerville Paper Box Limited until 1944. They sold Somerville Paper Box Limited to Garfield Weston in 1945 and changed their own O-Pee-Chee Co. Ltd. from a public company (since 1921) to a private company. The company was now run by John Gordon McDermid, the son and nephew of the McDermid brothers. The younger McDermid ran the company until his death in 1953 after which Frank Leahy took over the company. Leahy was the President of the O-Pee-Chee Co. Ltd. before he purchased the company from the McDermid estate in 1961. Leahy ran the business until his death in 1980, after which Gary Koreen stepped in and purchased the company from his wife, Mary-Margaret (the daughter of Frank Leahy). The sales for the first year of operation of O-Pee-Chee Company Limited were $177,389.84 with a profit of $4,766.92. The products manufactured were chewing gum, mints and various types of popcorn - especially Krackley Nut. In that year, there were 30 employees in the plant and the annual payroll was $31,614.38, including management salaries and bonuses. In 1921, O-Pee-Chee Gum Company was sold to a trust with the intent of incorporating the Company and changing its name to O-Pee-Chee Company Limited. Initially, it was incorporated as a public Company with five shareholders and four directors - all members of the McDermid family. In 1928, a manufacturing facility was built at 430 Adelaide Street in London. Initially, this plant was erected primarily to supply a substantial export gum business to the United Kingdom.East London Industrial Heritage Recommendations - Full Report From 1928 until 1989, this plant housed some of the most modern gum and candy making equipment available in the world. During the depression years, the Company operated mainly at a loss. In 1933, a licensing agreement was signed with a Buffalo firm, W & F Manufacturing, Co. who made paraffin chewing gum and novelties. This allowed O-Pee-Chee to sell these products in Canada as well as in Great Britain, Scotland, and Ireland. In the mid-1950s, Gurley Novelties, a candle company in Buffalo, New York, also signed with O-Pee-Chee, so candles could be sold In Great Britain, Scotland, Ireland, and eventually Canada. O Pee Chee sold Gurley Novelty candles under the name Gaybrite and TinselTown in Ireland and Scotland. About this time, Frank P. Leahy joined the firm as Sales Manager and John Gordon McDermid, the son of J.K. McDermid, also became active in the business. = Entering to cards market = Trading cards were a big part of the O-Pee-Chee business. Their first card sets were produced in the mid 1930s: a baseball \\"diamond\\" set (much larger than traditional cards) in 1934,O-Pee-Chee Trading Cards, 1933-34 on Biblioteca and Archives of Canada (Archived, 1 Oct 2007) five hockey sets between 1934 and 1938, a new baseball set in 1937,O-Pee-Chee baseball cards history on CardBoardConnection.com a Mickey Mouse set in 1935,1935 O-Pee-Chee Mickey Mouse cards on Pre-War Cards and a Fighting Forces set in 1939.1939 O-Pee-Chee Fighting Forces on Trading Card DB They made a few more sets in the 1940s, but it was not until the late 1950s that the company started to distribute cards on a regular basis. The McDermids owned and operated both O-Pee-Chee Company Limited and Somerville Paper Box Limited until 1944 when they sold the Somerville business to Garfield Weston. In 1945, O-Pee-Chee Company Limited was changed from a public company to a private company. For many years, National Novelty Company was a subsidiary of O-Pee-Chee Company acting as a retail outlet, selling candy goods over the counter, and also servicing gum vending machines in the area. With the arrival of World War II, accompanied by sugar and other commodity rationing, O-Pee-Chee Company existed mainly because of war contracts to supply dried egg powder to Europe and the United Kingdom. Employees, who worked at O-Pee-Chee during the war, recall the incident when a boat carrying a load of egg powder was sunk in the St. Lawrence River by a German submarine and the shipment had to be returned to London for repacking. During this time, the only gum product manufactured was Thrills - a product which is still being sold today. D.H. McDermid died in December 1942 and J.K. McDermid died of a heart attack in 1945 at age 79. J.K. was a charter member of the London Rotary Club and was an active executive of the Red Cross and YMCA He was a prominent member of the Talbot Street Baptist Church and deeded his property to the congregation where the First Baptist Church now stands in London. John Gordon McDermid became President in 1946 and ran the Company until his death in 1953. Under the able leadership of the new President, Frank P. Leahy, the Company flourished in the late 1950s. In 1958, a licensing agreement was arranged with a manufacturer in Brooklyn, New York, which dramatically increased the future potential of O-Pee-Chee Company. Subsequent to this, in 1961, Frank Leahy purchased the Company from the McDermid estate. About this time, another licensing agreement was signed with a large candy company located in St. Louis, Missouri. These two licensing arrangements, which still exist today, allowed O-Pee-Chee Company to manufacture and market the products of these two firms in Canada. Immediately, new products became available to the Canadian market which substantially increased the Company's sales volume, allowing for more efficient manufacturing and marketing techniques. = U.S. companies deals = In 1958, after the O-Pee-Chee Company entered into a marketing agreement with the Topps Company of the United States, O-Pee-Chee promoted annual trading card sets in Canada. Popular with kids, the standard packs included a stick of bubble gum with a stack of picture cards. In that first year, O-Pee-Chee helped produce hockey (1957-58 NHL) and football (1958 CFL) cards. In the 1960s, O-Pee-Chee and Topps worked closely together to produce sports and entertainment sets. The three sports promoted by O-Pee-Chee were baseball, gridiron football and ice hockey. Starting in 1961, the printing and production for these cards was moved to the O-Pee-Chee headquarters in London, Ontario, Canada. Those first Canadian sets were the 1961 CFL and 1961-62 NHL sets. While those two sets were unique to the Canadian marketplace, the hockey series did compete against a Parkies hockey series up until 1963-64. Starting in 1965, parts (or sometimes all) of the Topps baseball (Major League Baseball) series was produced as an O-Pee- Chee series in Canada. 1990‚Äì91 hockey card with the \\"Topps\\" brand (left); and the \\"O-Pee-Chee\\" logo (right) In the early 1960s, Beatlemania overtook North America with O-Pee-Chee Company having the rights to manufacture and market the Beatle Bubble Gum Cards for the Canadian market. In 1964, O-Pee-Chee produced four very popular entertainment card series featuring The Beatles.O-Pee-Chee The Beatles in color Up until 1967, the annual O-Pee-Chee (also known as Topps) hockey series was produced in Canada. After an American Topps \\"test\\" series was produced in the summer of 1967 (it looked just like the regular Canadian 1966-67 hockey series), O-Pee-Chee and Topps produced two annual hockey sets from 1968-69 onwards. The hockey double (an O-Pee-Chee set in Canada and a Topps set in the United States) coincided with the NHL's 1967 expansion from six to 12 teams. So while the 1967-68 series highlighted a six- team NHL, the two 1968-69 series highlighted a 12-team NHL. Of note, the Topps set would often be released first, but would include fewer cards than the O-Pee-Chee series. Also of interest, the card backs were primarily written by Topps, but the O-Pee-Chee card backs added a French translation. In 1970, due to Canadian federal legislation, O-Pee-Chee was compelled to add French- language text to the backs of its baseball cards.\\"A Brief History Of O-Pee- Chee\\" by Grant Rainsley It also happened to be the year after the Montreal Expos began to play in the majority Francophone province of Quebec. The practise of making bilingual cards had already been established for hockey. While O-Pee-Chee baseball sets were typically smaller than their Topps counterparts, its hockey sets for the Canadian market were larger. O-Pee-Chee also occasionally produced independent card sets of particular interest to Canadian collectors, such as one for the 1973 centennial of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the 1970s, O-Pee-Chee's last CFL set was produced in 1972. After World Hockey Association cards were first featured in the 1972-73 hockey series, an annual WHA series was produced from 1974-75 to 1977-78. Apart from sports card, the company also produced movie and T.V. \\"spin off\\" cards such as Happy Days (1976),Happy Days cards on Collectors.com Charlie's Angels (1977)1977 O-Pee-Chee Charlie's Angels checklist on Trading Card DB and Superman (1978).Superman movie cards From 1977 to 1989, O-Pee-Chee produced cards based on popular motion pictures including Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980),Empire Strikes Back cards Return of the Jedi (1983), E.T. (1982)1982 E.T. box busters on Beckett.com and Batman Returns (1992)Batman Returns trading card set In the 1980s, O-Pee-Chee (and Topps) produced annual album and sticker series for hockey and baseball (with the stickers produced by Panini). The stickers were so popular that Topps neglected to produce a hockey card series in either 1982-83 or 1983-84. (In fact, the stickers were so popular that by 1987-88 Panini had obtained its own license to produce NHL stickers in Canada). After working at O-Pee-Chee Company for nearly fifty years, Frank Leahy died suddenly in 1980. Gary E. Koreen, his son-in-law, who had been active in the business since 1968, became President and is now the owner of the business. In 1989, O-Pee-Chee Company moved into a new plant in London East which accommodates all Manufacturing, Raw Material and Finished Goods Storage plus Offices and Employee Facilities. This investment improves present manufacturing capabilities and provides for future growth and expansion. In 1990-91, O-Pee-Chee and Topps were joined in the NHL card market by Pro Set, Score and Upper Deck. That year, O-Pee-Chee produced a unique O-Pee-Chee Premier hockey series that was wildly popular with card collectors. Both an O-Pee-Chee and O-Pee-Chee Premier hockey series was produced in each of three successive seasons, but then in 1993-94 and 1994-95 only a Premier series was produced. As for baseball, the O-Pee-Chee Premier MLB series was produced from 1991 to 1993 while the last O-Pee-Chee MLB series was produced in 1994. = Last time and acquisition = The 1994 Major League Baseball strike and 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout and the accompanying damage to the baseball card industry hit O-Pee-Chee particularly hard. The company announced that it would leave the card business and refocus its efforts on candy. However, a number of changing circumstances kept them in the card business as well as candy. The 1994-95 hockey season was the last for O-Pee-Chee as a full company, though the Topps marketing arrangement kept the name alive. In 1996, O-Pee-Chee was bought by Nestl√© Corporation. In 1995-96, Topps included O-Pee- Chee cards in its signature product as a parallel set. It did the same in 1998-99 when it returned to the NHL market after a two-year hiatus. Later that year, O-Pee-Chee was re-introduced fully, as Topps used the company name for its Chrome set. One year later, O-Pee-Chee once again had a base-brand set. After Mr. Koreen sold his company, he kept the O-Pee-Chee brand name alive in the card collecting market through licences with the Topps and Upper Deck companies. From 1996 to 2004, the O-Pee-Chee name was used under license by Topps; since 2007, the O-Pee-Chee name has been owned by the Upper Deck Company. O-Pee-Chee cards continued to be produced through the 2003-04 hockey season. Prior to the start of the 2004-05 season, the NHL and NHLPA did not renew hockey-card licenses with the Topps Company (as well as In The Game or Pacific Trading Cards). Instead, the hockey market entered an exclusive five- year agreement with the Upper Deck Company to produce licensed NHL cards. In 2006, Upper Deck entered into an agreement with O-Pee-Chee to revive the O-Pee-Chee brand. Upper Deck's initial O-Pee-Chee Hockey product was released during the 2006-07 season. Upper Deck lost its Major League Baseball license in 2010. They continued to use the O-Pee-Chee brand for ice hockey. Vintage O-Pee-Chee cards are much sought-after today for their market value, and cards for popular players command high prices.

Playboy Entertainment Group, 529 U.S. 803 (2000), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court struck down Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which required that cable television operators completely scramble or block channels that are \\"primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming\\" or limit their transmission to the hours of 10 pm to 6 am.United States v. Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc., .  Background  In order to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed, the U.S. Congress enacted Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 on the basis of a handful of complaints. No congressional hearing was held.First Amendment Center, The Playboy Signal Bleed Case Should Never Have Been A Case Section 505 required cable television operators providing channels ‚Äúprimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programs‚Äù either to completely scramble or otherwise block those channels, or to limit their transmission hours to when children were unlikely to view. Administrative regulations defined children as unlikely to view programming between 10 pm to 6 am.. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. challenged Section 505's constitutionality, claiming that the provision violated the First Amendment. =Procedural history= A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware held that Section 505 was a content-based restriction on speech that was subject to strict scrutiny. In order to satisfy a strict scrutiny analysis, the Government was required to prove that it was ‚Äúnarrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.‚ÄùCNN, \\"Supreme Court says adult programming restrictions on cable are unconstitutional\\" The Government offered three interests to justify Section 505: (1) protecting children from being exposed to sexually explicit material; (2) supporting parents' rights to raise their children as they see fit; and (3) ensuring an individual's right to privacy in the home. The District Court agreed that the interests the statute advanced were compelling but concluded that it violated the First Amendment because the Government might further its interests through less restrictive alternatives. One less restrictive means is Section 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, upon request of a subscriber to fully scramble or otherwise block a channel that the subscriber does not wish to receive. The United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court, seeking to have the judgment reversed. A group of sexologists filed an amicus brief on behalf of Playboy arguing that there was no state interest in shielding minors from sexually explicit signal bleed. The brief's authors included Elizabeth Rice Allgeier, Vern L. Bullough, Milton Diamond, Harold I. Lief, John Money, and Ira L. Reiss.Amici Curiae Brief  Opinion of the Court  Affirming the District Court, the Supreme Court held, in an opinion authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, that Section 505 was a content-based restriction because the provision singled out not only particular programming but also particular programmers. Moreover, although the Court accepted the Government's compelling interests, it nevertheless concluded that the provision violated the First Amendment's free speech clause because the Government failed to prove that Section 505 was the least restrictive means of preventing children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed. The Court stated that Section 504 presented such an alternative means of regulation. The Government argued that Section 504 was less effective than the blocking and time- channeling provision of Section 505. However, the Court held that Section 504, combined with ‚Äúmarket-based solutions such as programmable televisions, VCR's, and mapping systems‚Äù can eliminate signal bleed without restricting a cable operator's ability to transmit its programming to those who want to receive it.Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. at 821. The Court concluded that because of the existence of such alternatives, which could be equally effective at furthering the Government's interest, the overly restrictive Section 505 violated the First Amendment. Justices Stevens, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg joined with Kennedy in the majority. = Concurrences = Stevens and Thomas filed concurring opinions. Stevens's concurrence specifically addressed Scalia's criticisms of the majority opinion. Stevens argued that Scalia defined obscenity too broadly and could include practices that were merely deceptive. Thomas noted in his concurrence that he would have decided the case differently if the broadcasts were of obscene material. He posited that the government had merely argued that the broadcasts were indecent. First Amendment protections have more sway over merely indecent material than outright obscene material. Thus, the balancing of interests weighed in favor of upholding First Amendment protection. = Dissents = Justice Stephen G. Breyer authored a dissent, arguing that the majority of the court had not made a \\"realistic assessment of the alternatives.\\"Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. at 846 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia. Justice Scalia also authored his own dissent arguing that Section 505 is constitutional because it regulates the business of obscenity.

When opened by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield on 20 December 1920 the picture house was the largest and most luxurious cinema in Sheffield, often referred to as the \\"Picture Palace\\" because of the luxurious cream and gold colour scheme, and dark mahogany seats trimmed with green velvet. The picture house also boasted many intricate decorations and carvings, a mosaic floor in the foyer and a glass canopy with a marble pillar to the outside of the building. History The first film to be shown was The Call of the Road (IMDB entry). The cinema had seating for 1,560 people and also included a ballroom and a billiard hall (the latter is still in operation). Cine-variety played a major role at the Abbeydale until 1930 and the arrival of the \\"talkies\\" talking films; from this time the stage was used purely to house the sound equipment. In the mid-1950s the cinema was purchased by the Star Cinema Group which decorated the entire building and installed new projection and sound equipment, including a wide screen. The cinema closed on 5 July 1975 and was subsequently used as an office furniture showroom until 1991. In 1989 the building was given a Grade II listing by English Heritage being a good example of an early 1920s mid-sized suburban cinema with both cinema and theatre facilities. In 1991 the sprung floor in the ballroom was removed, and local businesses \\"Abbey Snooker\\" and \\"Bar Abbey\\" occupied the site. In 2003 the Friends of Abbeydale Picture House--boasting patrons including Michael Palin, Peter Stringfellow and the John Lewis Partnership--was formed to \\"restore and manage the 'Picture Palace' as a community centre for the performing arts and visual media.\\" The group took ownership of the building on 21 December 2005 and re-opened it in September 2008 following a restoration of the auditorium and installation of a new stage. The Abbeydale Picture House hosted regular performances and fundraisers to raise money towards the ongoing restoration of the building. In June 2012 a stage adaptation of Hi-de-Hi! was produced by the picture house in conjunction with the family of the late David Croft. The building is open for guided tours as part of the Heritage Open Days program. The Friends of Abbeydale Picture House eventually went into administration and the building went into receivership On 30 October 2012 the picture house was sold at auction to Phil Robins, for ¬£150,000 with the intention to renovate the building and bring it back into public use as a climbing and sports centre. During this period further renovations were undertaken by Phil Robins, assisted during 2015-16 by Hand Of. In January 2017 Abbeydale Picture House was leased to CADS Trust, a Sheffield-based arts charity, who are continuing the restoration project. The building is now regularly open to the public as a mixed use community arts venue as work progresses.

Native to densely vegetated habitats in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, its popularity as a cage-bird and songster has led to it being introduced elsewhere. Taxonomy White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus) male, Khao Yai National Park, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand It was formerly classified as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, causing it to be commonly known as the white-rumped shama thrush or simply shama thrush. =Subspecies= The nominate race is found in the Western Ghats and parts of southern India while leggei is found in Sri Lanka. Race indicus is found in the northern parts of India.Rasmussen PC & Anderton, JC (2005) Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Smithsonian Institution & Lynx Edicions, , pp. 395‚Äì396 Race albiventris is found in the Andaman Islands and now usually considered a distinct species, the Andaman shama. Race interpositus from southwestern Asia-China to Myanmar, Thailand and the Mergui Archipelago. Southern China has race minor while mallopercnus is found in the Malay peninsula. Race tricolor is found in the Sumatra, Java, Banka, Belitung and Karimata islands. Race mirabilis from the Sunda Strait, melanurus from northwestern Sumatra, opisthopelus, javanus, omissus, ochroptilus, abbotti, eumesus, suavis (Borneo), nigricauda, stricklandii and barbouri are the other island forms. The last two are sometimes regarded as a separate species, the white-crowned shama (C. stricklandii). Description Male at Durrell Wildlife Park, Jersey They typically weigh between and are around in length. Males are glossy black with a chestnut belly and white feathers on the rump and outer tail. Females are more greyish-brown, and are typically shorter than males. Both sexes have a black bill and pink feet. Juveniles have a greyish- brown colouration, similar to that of the females, with a blotchy or spotted chest. Behaviour=Breeding= The white-rumped shama is shy and somewhat crepuscular but very territorial. The territories include a male and female during the breeding season with the males defending the territory averaging 0.09 ha in size, but each sex may have different territories when they are not breeding. In South Asia, they breed from January to September but mainly in April to June laying a clutch of four or five eggsWhistler, H (1949) Popular handbook of Indian birds. Gurney and Jackson. p. 110 in a nest placed in the hollow of a tree. During courtship, males pursue the female, alight above the female, give a shrill call, and then flick and fan out their tail feathers. This is followed by a rising and falling flight pattern by both sexes. If the male is unsuccessful, the female will threaten the male, gesturing with the mouth open. The nest is built by the female alone while the male stands guard.Ali, S. and Ripley, S. D. (1973). Handbook of the birds of India and Pakistan. Vol. 8., Oxford Univ. Press, Bombay, India. The nests are mainly made of roots, leaves, ferns, and stems, and incubation lasts between 12 and 15 days and the nestling period averaged 12.4 days. Both adults feed the young although only the female incubates and broods. The eggs are white to light aqua, with variable shades of brown blotching, with dimensions of about . =Feeding= They feed on insects in the wild but in captivity they may be fed on a diet of boiled, dried legumes with egg yolk and raw meat.Jerdon, T. C. (1863) Birds of India. Vol 2. part 1. page 131 =Voice= Calls Sonogram The voice of this species is rich and melodious which makes them popular as cage birds in South Asia with the tradition continuing in parts of Southeast Asia. It is loud and clear, with a variety of phrases, and often mimics other birds. They also make a 'Tck' call in alarm or when foraging. One of the first recordings of a bird song that was ever made was of this species. This recording was made in 1889 from a captive individual using an Edison wax cylinder by Ludwig Koch in Germany.Ranft, Richard (2004) Natural sound archives: past, present and future. An. Acad. Bras. Ci√™nc. 76(2):456‚Äì460 Distribution and habitat They are native across scrub and secondary forests in South and Southeast Asia, but have been introduced to Kauai, Hawaii, in early 1931 from Malaysia (by Alexander Isenberger), and to Oahu in 1940 (by the Hui Manu Society). Their popularity as a cage bird has led to many escaped birds establishing themselves. They have been introduced to Taiwan where they are considered an invasive species, eating native insect species and showing aggression towards native bird species. In Asia, their habitat is dense undergrowth especially in bamboo forests. In Hawaii, they are common in valley forests or on the ridges of the southern Koolaus, and tend to nest in undergrowth or low trees of lowland broadleaf forests.

G. Thursfield, ‚ÄòEvans, Edward Ratcliffe Garth Russell, first Baron Mountevans (1880‚Äì1957)‚Äô, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011. Evans was seconded from the Navy to the Discovery expedition to Antarctica in 1901‚Äì1904, when he served on the crew of the relief ship, and afterwards began planning his own Antarctic expedition. However, he suspended this plan when offered the post of second- in-command on Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole in 1910‚Äì1913, as captain of the expedition ship . He accompanied Scott to within 150 miles of the Pole, but was sent back in command of the last supporting party. On the return he became seriously ill with scurvy and only narrowly survived. After the expedition he toured the country giving lectures, and returned to his naval duties as a commander in the summer of 1914. He spent the First World War as a destroyer captain, becoming famous as \\"Evans of the Broke\\" after the battle of Dover Strait in 1917. He commanded a cruiser at Hong Kong in 1921‚Äì1922, where he was awarded a medal for his role in rescuing passengers from the wrecked-vessel , and then spent several years commanding the Home Fisheries Protection Squadron before being given command of the modern battlecruiser . He later commanded the Australian Squadron and the Africa Station before becoming Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, one of the Navy's senior Home Commands; during this time, unusually for a serving officer, he was also Rector of the University of Aberdeen. After four years at the Nore, he handed over command in early 1939, and was appointed Civil Defence Commissioner for London during the preparations for the Second World War; after the German invasion of Norway he travelled there to liaise with King Haakon VII, a personal acquaintance. He remained in a civil defence role throughout the War, though he had officially retired from the Navy in 1941, and was raised to the peerage in 1945, sitting in the House of Lords as a Labour member. Early life Edward Ratcliffe Garth Evans, known to his family and friends as \\"Teddy\\", was born in London on 28 October 1880, at a mews near Berkeley Square. He was the second of three sons born to Frank Evans and his wife Eliza, n√©e McNulty.www.burkespeerage.com Frank Evans, a young barrister at Lincoln's Inn, hailed from a large Lancashire family of Welsh descent; his father had been a provision merchant in Oldham. Eliza McNulty's family were of Irish origin and lived at Deptford.Pound, pp. 1‚Äì3 The family were respectably middle-class, but the three Evans children did not behave as respectably as might be expected; when Edward was nine, he and his brothers frequently roamed far into the East End, on one occasion being detained by the police after a theft. Edward and his older brother Joe were admitted to the Merchant Taylors' School in 1890, when he was ten, and were expelled for fighting and truancy a year later. He was then sent to a relatively modern school in the countryside near Croydon, which aimed to educate \\"troublesome boys\\";Pound, p. 5 despite being the youngest boy and often victimised and homesick, he enjoyed the rural environment and responded well to the teaching. He later attended a school in Maida Vale where he obtained high marks but slipped back into his old misbehaviour; the headmaster responded by making him a prefect, which shocked Evans into self-discipline. He became one of the school's star performers, with a string of prizes, before leaving at 14.Pound, pp. 3‚Äì8 Evans sought a career at sea, and while at school had tried, but failed, to obtain a cadetship with the Royal Navy training ship . The alternatives open to him were to be \\"crammed\\" by an expensive tutor and resit the Britannia examination, or to attend the cheaper privately run training ship HMS Worcester, which mainly trained officers for the Merchant Navy. His father chose the latter, and Evans joined the Worcester in January 1895. He was heavily bullied, but by the middle of his second year had found his place, and gained a reputation as an able and diligent ‚Äì if still troublesome ‚Äì cadet. He won several prizes, culminating in a coveted Navy cadetship in his final year.Pound, pp. 8‚Äì13 The newly commissioned Midshipman Evans was posted to the cruiser in the Mediterranean in 1897, a ship noted for her immaculate presentation and strict conduct, which was not entirely to Evans' taste. In August he became seriously ill with brucellosis, after drinking contaminated milk, and was sent home to recover for three months. During this time, he gained a lasting fanaticism for physical fitness, walking forty or fifty miles in a day and swimming for hours in the sea; he would maintain this state of fitness for decades to come. After returning to duty, he was posted to the battleship and then the sloop , following which he was examined and passed as a sub-lieutenant. He then studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, interrupted with a posting to , where he first encountered then-Lieutenant Robert Falcon Scott.Pound, pp. 14‚Äì19 First Antarctic expedition, 1902‚Äì04 In July 1901, the British National Antarctic Expedition ‚Äì the \\"Discovery Expedition\\" ‚Äì sailed from London aboard , with Scott in command. Part of the planning for the expedition had provided for a relief ship to follow a year later, in case Discovery was lost in the Antarctic; on reading a newspaper article about this some months later, Evans saw an opportunity for adventure and wrote to Sir Clements Markham, the organising force behind the expedition. He met Markham twice in the following weeks, and made a strong impression. In early 1902, Evans was seconded from the Navy to be second officer aboard the relief ship, the , an ageing ex-whaler.Pound, pp. 23‚Äì26 The Morning sailed from London in July 1902, and after a severe storm and a refit in Christchurch, New Zealand, headed for the Antarctic on 6 December to search for the expedition in their winter quarters, somewhere in the Ross Sea.Pound, pp. 29‚Äì32 After working steadily south-east from Cape Adare and along the ice- front to Cape Crozier, the limit of their search range, they found a message from the expedition, directing them back towards McMurdo Sound. Here the two crews met ‚Äì the two ships were separated by fifteen miles of ice, requiring long sledge journeys ‚Äì with Evans among the first party to greet the Discoverys crew. A week later, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson returned from their journey inland, sick with scurvy and snow-blindness, but triumphant at having reached 82¬∞17‚Ä≤S, a new \\"Farthest South\\". Evans privately recorded that having known the three was \\"a great thing in my life\\".Pound, pp. 36‚Äì43 At the end of March 1903 the Morning was ordered to return, leaving supplies with the Discovery, still sealed in the ice. Several crew were exchanged, including Shackleton, who was considered not healthy enough to remain for the winter, though personal conflicts with Scott may have played a part in the decision. Once back in New Zealand, Evans applied for a temporary posting to stationed in the country, while the Morning was refitted for another relief voyage, this time organised by the Admiralty rather than the Royal Geographical Society. She sailed south again in November, in company with a second relief ship, Terra Nova, and met the Discovery in January 1904. Evans was given charge of a party of men laying explosives to blast a channel through eight miles of ice, which they achieved in eleven days, bringing the Discovery out just before a heavy gale struck.Pound, pp. 45‚Äì51 In recognition of his work with the expedition, Scott named a mountain overlooking the Sound as Mount Evans. Shortly before sailing south for the second time, Evans' engagement to a New Zealand woman, Hilda Russell, had been announced. Hilda was the daughter of T.G. Russell, a prominent local solicitor, and the niece of G.W. Russell, one of the Members of Parliament for the Christchurch area. Evans arrived back in Christchurch on 1 April 1904, and the couple were married on 13 April. They arrived back in England in October, where Evans was awarded the Bronze Polar Medal and rejoined the navy, specialising as a navigation officer. In 1907 he briefly considered applying to join Shackleton's Antarctic expedition, but decided instead that it was important to spend more time in his naval career, to avoid limiting his future prospects.Pound, pp. 47, 51‚Äì53 Second Antarctic expedition, 1910‚Äì13 In 1909, Evans finally succumbed to the lure of the Antarctic, and announced ‚Äì with Markham's blessing ‚Äì that he would organise an expedition to explore King Edward VII Land. He planned an expedition to the Pole, but as a secondary objective; \\"the circum-navigation of the great Antarctic continent appealed to me far more\\".Evans (1946), p. 80 Evans initially sought support in Cardiff for a Welsh National Antarctic Expedition. Around the same time, Scott began planning a new expedition in response to Shackleton's recently completed Nimrod Expedition ‚Äì the two were by this time rivals ‚Äì and on hearing of this Evans abandoned his own project, transferring his funding and support to Scott. In return, Scott appointed him second-in- command. Evans brought so much Cardiff and Welsh sponsorship that Scott named Cardiff the home port of the expedition ship, Terra Nova and made Evans Captain. Despite this partnership, the two were never close, with the clash between Scott's reserve and Evans' openness accentuated by the difference in rank and age.Pound, pp. 53‚Äì56, 63‚Äì64 Scott later described Evans in his diary as carried by \\"boyish enthusiasms\\" and \\"well-meaning, but terribly slow to learn\\",Pound, p. 81 deeming that he was much more capable as a sailor than an explorer on land, and probably would never be suited to command his own expedition.Pound, pp 81‚Äì2 The expedition landed on the west side of Ross Island on 4 January 1911,Pound, p. 72 at a site Scott named Cape Evans in Evans' honour. Evans joined the main shore party, leaving the Terra Nova in the hands of Lieutenant Harry Pennell, and worked to establish a series of depots along the Great Ice Barrier for the use of the Polar expedition later in the year.Pound, pp. 72‚Äì80 After wintering in the Cape Evans hut, the party began to prepare for the main journey in August and September. Evans was given command of the Motor Party, which was to leave first, taking four men and two tracked motor sledges south onto the Barrier with supplies for the main expedition, which would follow with dogs and ponies.Pound, pp. 84‚Äì88 In the event, the motor sledges failed to work as planned; the engines proved unreliable, frequently refusing to start until heated, or stopping after a short distance. The first broke down permanently on 30 October, five days after starting, and the second followed a day later. The four men reorganised their loads and pushed south pulling a single sledge with of equipment and supplies. They managed about the same speed as before the breakdown, and made the rendezvous six days ahead of the main party, who caught up with them on 21 November. Two of Evans' party (the motor mechanic and an assistant) returned north, and the Motor Party was reorganised as the \\"Man-hauling Party\\". with Evans leading Chief Stoker Lashly, Surgeon-Lieutenant Atkinson and C. S. Wright, a Canadian physicist. The group pushed onwards until 5 December, when they were halted by a blizzard for four days, working through their supplies but unable to press south. The remaining ponies from the main expedition had to be shot before moving on. On arriving at the Beardmore Glacier on 10 December, their route off the Barrier, the dog parties were also sent back, leaving the entire expedition to be man-hauled.Pound, pp. 89‚Äì97 At this point, the expedition was made up of three groups of four men, all man-hauling their sledges. However, two of the groups were relatively rested, whilst Evans and Lashly had been pulling a sledge since 1 November. This began to tell, with the group dropping behind and causing tensions with Scott, who grew frustrated and impatient with Evans' perceived carelessness and disorganisation.Pound, pp. 97‚Äì98 On 20 December, the first supporting party turned back, leaving eight men to press onwards; Evans' team was reorganised comprising himself, Lieutenant Bowers, Lashly, and Petty Officer Crean. On 3 January, Scott announced that Evans would not continue to the Pole, but would take his team, the Last Supporting Party, back north. Evans privately attributed this to his physical exhaustion ‚Äì he and Lashly had pulled a loaded sledge for six hundred miles by this stage ‚Äì and recorded his reactions stoically, though Bowers described him as \\"frightfully cut up\\".Pound, p. 105 The groups parted emotionally on 4 January, and Evans, Lashly and Crean turned to head back, only from the Pole ‚Äì Bowers had remained with the main party.Pound, pp. 101‚Äì107 The journey back was difficult, as until this point the sledges had been handled by four-man teams, and the reduction to three slowed them considerably. In an attempt to save several days, the party descended from the plateau by sledging several hundred feet down the deeply crevassed Shackleton Icefalls onto the Beardmore Glacier, rather than take the slower and safer climb down the mountainside. The three emerged battered but without major injury, despite having reached speeds that Evans estimated at close to sixty miles per hour.Pound, pp. 108‚Äì110 Once on the glacier, however, Evans began to suffer severe physical problems. He was initially afflicted with snow- blindness, making him unable to see clearly, and later began to develop the early signs of scurvy. These signs rapidly multiplied, leaving him weakened and constantly in severe pain, and within a couple of weeks he had deteriorated to the point that he was being pulled on the sledge by Lashly and Crean.Pound, pp. 111‚Äì115 Evans was the only one to develop scurvy to this degree, and a number of arguments have been put forward as to the reason. However, it seems likely that the root cause was that unlike the other explorers, Evans had apparently tried to avoid eating seal meat (in particular seal liver) during the winter, which he disliked but which was a rich source of Vitamin C.May, pp. 73‚Äì76 As his companion Frank Debenham put it many years later, \\"Teddy really was a very naughty boy and wouldn't eat his seal meat\\".May, p. 75 On 13 February, Evans attempted to order them to abandon him, but they refused, in what Evans later called \\"the first and last time my orders as a naval officer were disobeyed\\".Pound, p. 116 They were finally forced to halt by a blizzard on 17 February, thirty-five miles from the base camp at Hut Point, when it became clear that the two men would no longer be able to pull the sledge. Lashly remained to look after Evans while Crean headed north; after walking for eighteen hours, he arrived at the hut where he met Atkinson with an assistant and a dog team. They headed south as soon as the weather cleared, finding Evans near to death, and carefully brought him back to the camp. He arrived there a few days before the Terra Nova returned, and he was returned to the ship to be nursed back to health. He remained bedridden until April, when he arrived in New Zealand.Pound, pp. 116‚Äì119 After meeting Amundsen, recently returned from the Pole, and being reunited with his wife, Evans headed back to England, where he spent the northern summer of 1912 recuperating and raising funds for the Expedition. There, he met King George V, who promoted him to the rank of commander. Returning south later in the year, Evans commanded the Terra Nova on its relief journey; it arrived at McMurdo Sound on 18 January, the anniversary of Scott's arrival at the Pole, to be greeted by the news of the polar party's death. Recording his \\"overwhelming sorrow\\" at the news, Evans assumed formal command of the expedition in lieu of Scott, and organised the final departure of the expedition from the continent.Pound, pp. 119‚Äì125 Evans' wife, Hilda, became ill with peritonitis on board the Oranto on 14 April 1913 whilst on her way to England with her husband after his return from Scott's second and fateful expedition. She was operated on by the ship's doctor on 15 April. Conscious when the ship reached Naples on the 17th she stayed on board but after setting back to sea, she died at midnight of 18 April. Hilda was buried in Toulon, France. A memorial to Hilda Evans is to be found in Linwood Cemetery, Bromley, Christchurch, New Zealand at Block 46 Plot 205 ‚Äì the Russell family grave. In 1921 Evans published through Collins, a first hand account of the Discovery Expedition entitled South With Scott. Out of print for many years, the book attracted interest as the centenary of the Expedition approached and it was re-examined from a counter revisionist perspective, most notably by Karen May of the Scott Polar Institute. First World War Following his Antarctic service, Evans had a successful naval career, serving at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 in the rank of commander. On 20 April 1917, while on night patrol of the Dover Barrage near Goodwin Sands, he commanded the destroyer in an action against six German destroyers of the Kaiserliche Marine that had started to bombard Dover. Along with , Evans engaged the German destroyers in what became known as the Battle of Dover Strait. A torpedo from HMS Swift sank one of the enemy destroyers, . Then the Broke deliberately rammed another, , almost breaking it in two. The two ships became locked together and for a while there was close-quarters fighting on Broke's deck until the Broke managed to break free. The German destroyer sank while the remaining German warships escaped. The badly damaged Broke was towed home, while the equally damaged Swift made her own way back. The action gained him immediate promotion to the rank of captain, award of the DSO, and made Evans a popular hero, feted in the British press as \\"Evans of the Broke\\". Evans wrote an account of his activities on the Dover Patrol in his book Keeping the Seas (1920). Evans married Norwegian Elsa Andvord in 1916, by whom he had two children: Richard Evans, 2nd Baron Mountevans (born 1918), and Cdr the Hon Edward Evans (born 1924), both of whom left children. Inter-war service Admiral Sir Edward Evans in 1944 While in command of on the China Station, Evans rescued 200 survivors from the SS Hong Moh. His actions, including swimming to give direction on the sinking ship, earned him several awards for life-saving. In February 1928 he was promoted to rear-admiral commanding the Royal Australian Navy Fleet (formally titled \\"Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron\\"). In November 1932 he was made vice-admiral. He was commander-in-chief of the Africa Station and Deputy High Commissioner of the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland, Swaziland and Basutoland from 1933 to 1935. He served as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, an operational command position of the Royal Navy based at Chatham in Kent, from 1935 to 1939 and was promoted to admiral in July 1936. Evans was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1935, and appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (KGStJ) in 1937. Second World War Recalled in 1939, the following year Evans participated in the Norwegian Campaign, after which he retired from the Royal Navy on 9 January 1941. During the remainder of the Second World War he served as London Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence. On 12 November 1945, he was created a Peer as Baron Mountevans, of Chelsea in the County of London. He was Rector of the University of Aberdeen from 1936 to 1942. Retirement On 4 March 1947 Mountevans was on board a Norwegian vessel, MV Bolivar, when it broke in two and was wrecked on the Kish Bank 13 kilometers from Dalkey Island. He and 44 others on board were rescued by the D√∫n Laoghaire and Howth RNLI lifeboats. In 1947 Evans chaired a committee to formalise the rules of professional wrestling in the UK. These rules became known as the Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules. Evans died in Norway on 20 August 1957. He is buried in the family plot at the V√•r Frelsers gravlund cemetery in Oslo.

Career Tucker began his career playing cover versions of Juan Atkins' electro hits from the 1980s with his childhood friend Tommy Hamilton. The live ensemble achieved local renown for combining break-dancing, and Tucker's mobile DJing while manually playing repetitive, high-speed synthesizer basslines. They later became known as Regime, then RX-7, and finally, in 1994 they became Aux 88. They were joined by BJ Smith (Posatronix) and Lamont Norwood (DJ Dijital). Tucker's first 12\\" EP was a collaboration with Juan Atkins and Jesse Anderson, under the name \\"Frequency\\" in 1990. Aux 88 released the album \\"Bass Magnetic\\" and were the first group to revive Electro in the mid-to-late 1990s. As such they have been credited with eventually inspiring the genre known as electroclash. In the mid-1990s they described their own sound as Techno-Bass, a fusion of influences from Detroit techno, electro, Miami bass. As co-founder of Puzzlebox recordings in 1996 with Anthony \\"Shake\\" Shakir, Tucker also joined the tradition of independent dance music publishing and vinyl record pressing in Detroit. He utilized, along with other artists, the National Sound Company vinyl lathe which was used to produce the records of legendary Detroit Soul labels such as Motown. In 2006, Tucker's song \\"Plastic People\\" was featured on the DJ mix album A Bugged Out Mix by Miss Kittin, which charted at number one-hundred seventy on the French Albums Chart. Music Among his influences, he cites 1970s Funk such as Parliament, Kraftwerk and classical music, particularly Johann Sebastian Bach. The distinction of his solo work and production credits, is in their blending and refinement of syncopated, minimalist Electro and Techno rhythms influenced by the tonal undulations of Miami Bass and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. True to the Detroit techno tradition, Tucker's music is often emotive of a machine-like consciousness and a mental imagery of solipsism, urban alienation and decay. This is often expressed, masked or sublimated through metaphors of high technology, science fiction and space travel and conveyed through affected analogue synthesizer timbres. This harks back to Kraftwerk's description of their music ‚Äì \\"Electronic blues made with a jazz improvisation technique.‚Äù ReferencesExternal links * optic- universe.com ‚Äì Keith Tucker's website Optic Universe * aux88.com ‚Äì official website of AUX 88  Keith Tucker at Last.fm Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Detroit Category:American techno musicians ","title":"Keith Tucker"},{"id":"2296810","text":"Edmond L√©vy (born 1934) is a French classical historian.

(1888). Ancien Japon, p. 79. The clan was split into three branch families, the ≈ågigayatsu, Inukake and Yamanouchi Uesugi, which boasted considerable influence. The Uesugi are perhaps best known for Uesugi Kenshin (1530‚Äì1578), originally from the Nagao clan, one of Sengoku's more prominent warlords. The family name is sometimes rendered as Uyesugi, but this is representative of historical kana usage; the \\"ye\\" spelling is no longer used in Japanese. In the Edo period, the Uesugi were identified as one of the tozama or outsider clans, in contrast with the fudai or insider daimy≈ç clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.

Kanj≈´ji Shigefusa was a 13th generation descendant of the clan's great progenitor. Near the end of the 13th century, he received Uesugi domain in Tango Province, and he adopted the name of \\"Uesugi\\" after arriving and establishing himself. The three main branches of the Uesugi are the Inukake, the Yamanouchi and the ≈ågigayatsu. Muromachi period The mother of the Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji (1305‚Äì1358) was a daughter of Uesugi Yorishige and a granddaughter of Shigefusa. The three Uesugi branch families are descendants of Uesugi Yorishige. Throughout the Muromachi period, members of the clan were appointed shugo (provincial governors), and would also dominate the post of Kant≈ç Kanrei (shogun's deputy in Kant≈ç). They gained such power in the Kant≈ç region that, when in 1449 Kanrei Ashikaga Shigeuji killed his deputy Uesugi Noritada to significantly diminish if not eliminate the family's power, the Uesugi rose up and drove Shigeuji out of the area, asking the shogunate in Kyoto for another Kanrei. This development left the Uesugi extremely powerful within the Kant≈ç region, more so than ever before, and the clan quickly expanded and grew, splitting into three branches, named after their home localities. The ≈ågigayatsu became based at Kawagoe Castle, in Musashi Province, while the Yamanouchi were in Hirai, in K≈çzuke Province. The third branch, the Inukake, held a castle in the region as well. The three would begin fighting for domination of the clan and the region almost as soon as the split occurred, and intense fighting continued for roughly twenty-five years, until the end of the ≈ånin War came about in 1477, bringing with it the end of the shogunate. Though the ≈ågigayatsu and Yamanouchi branches both survived this conflict, the Inukake did not. Sengoku period Traditionally the ≈ågigayatsu relied on the ≈åta clan, while the Yamanouchi relied on the Nagao of Echigo Province as the pillars of their strength. ≈åta D≈çkan, a vassal of the ≈ågigayatsu Uesugi, who were less numerous than their Yamanouchi cousins, lent them a great boost of power by building Edo Castle for them in the 1450s. On the other hand, Nagao Tamekage, Deputy Constable of Kamakura in the first decades of the 16th century, allied himself with H≈çj≈ç S≈çun, who would later become one of the Uesugi's strongest rivals. The expansion of the H≈çj≈ç into the lower Kant≈ç forced the two branches of the Uesugi to become allies. In 1537, Kawagoe fell to H≈çj≈ç Ujitsuna. Then in 1545, both of the branches of the Uesugi shared defeat, and attempted to regain their power. However, the ≈ågigayatsu branch family came to an end with the death of Uesugi Tomosada, during a failed attempt to retake Kawagoe castle that year. Uesugi Norimasa, the holder of Hirai castle, which had fallen in 1551 to the H≈çj≈ç, took up arms with his retainer, Nagao Kagetora in Echigo. Kagetora then adopted the surname of \\"Uesugi\\" after campaigning against the H≈çj≈ç in Sagami Province; he would later take the name Uesugi Kenshin, and become one of Sengoku's most famous generals, battling the H≈çj≈ç and Takeda Shingen for control of the Kant≈ç. At the end of the Sengoku period, Kenshin's adopted son Uesugi Kagekatsu, then head of the clan, was a supporter of Ishida Mitsunari during the battle of Sekigahara. As a result of being on the losing side of the conflict, the Uesugi were afterwards much reduced in power. Edo period Uesugi Kagekatsu was given the tozama domain of Yonezawa (300,000 koku) in Dewa Province, in Honsh≈´'s T≈çhoku (Northeast) Region. Much research has been done on the economics of Yonezawa in the Edo period, particularly by Mark Ravina among others, and it is taken as fairly representative of a tozama (outsider) domain. Yonezawa was far from the capital, with far less direct political control from the shogunate, and also less trade and urbanization. Yonezawa was largely an agricultural domain, making it again a good representation of agricultural and social developments among the peasantry in this period. Despite agricultural advances and generally high growth in the 17th century, Yonezawa, like most parts of the country, experienced a considerable drop in growth after 1700; it may in fact have entered stagnation or decline. The official koku revenue of the Uesugi daimy≈ç was cut in half in 1664, but the clan continued to expend as before, maintaining the same lordly standard of living. Yonezawa, again representative of many other domains, entered debt, and was especially hard-struck by famines in the 1750s. The situation became so bad that in 1767, daimy≈ç Uesugi Shigesada considered giving the territory back to the shogunate. Instead, he allowed his adopted son Uesugi Harunori to take over as daimy≈ç; through agricultural and moral reforms, and series of other strict policies, Harunori turned the domain around. In 1830, less than ten years after Harunori's death, the shogunate officially praised Yonezawa as an exemplar of good governance. The Meiji Restoration in 1868 brought the abolition of the han system, that is, the end of the domains, the feudal lords, and the samurai class. Meiji period and modern era The head of this clan line was ennobled as a count in the Meiji period. The present head of the clan, Uesugi Kuninori (born 1942) is a professor at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Ministry of Education.

The story follows superhuman Meriem Cooper, a 19-year-old jungle woman who battles dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures in the Cretaceous period. Root credits the artist William Stout, as well as the Playboy cartoon feature Little Annie Fanny, as his inspirations for the character. The artists Devon Massey and Robert Durham have done much of the cover art for the series and related one-shots and spin-offs. Publication history Regarding the character's creation, Root said, He added that Meriem was \\"patterned after pretty much all the women I really respect. She's got a body with kind of a Little Annie Fannie face with Danni Ashe's boobs and Nina Hartley's butt.\\" Meriem Cooper first appeared in Basement Comics' Cavewoman #1 (Dec. 1993), the first issue of a black-and-white, miniseries that ran for six issues. She reappeared in the popular eight-issue miniseries Cavewoman: Rain (1996‚Äì1997) from Caliber Comics, and Cavewoman: Odyssey #1 (1999), the only issue of a planned five-issue miniseries from Caliber Comics. She also appeared in the four-issue series Cavewoman: Missing Link (1997‚Äì1998), and the three-part series Cavewoman: Jungle Tales (1998). During her early years Meriem also appeared in several one-shot comics, like Cavewoman Meets Explorers (1997), jointly from Basement Comics and Explorer Press; Jungle Tales of Cavewoman (1998), released in both a standard and a mature-audience edition; and Cavewoman: Color Special (1999), reprinting a story in the comic Threshold #7. After 2000, Meriem appeared in the ongoing series Cavewoman: Pangaean Sea. After the events of Cavewoman: Rain the town of Marshville was destroyed, and Meriem and the inhabitants migrated to the shores of the Pangaean Sea. This was the last lengthy Cavewoman series to date, and by far the longest.

Fictional character biography The story of Cavewoman is rooted deeply in science fiction and fantasy. Meriem Cecilbie Cooper is born in July 1980 to parents Robert Addam Cooper and Gail Nicole Reicher, in the fictional town of Marshville, Oregon. After Robert dies of unknown causes, Gail turns to drugs, which leads her to fall in with an unsavory secret group of government agents. Eventually wanting to sever her ties with this group for Meriem's sake, Gail seeks the help of Meriem's scientist-inventor grandfather Francis Peacock Reicher affectionately called \\"Gramp.\\" After first being thwarted, Gramp makes a mysteriously superhuman return, defeating the agents easily and taking 8-year-old Meriem away on a hovercycle from the future. At Gramp's laboratory, Meriem discovers a time machine and a body-enhancing device that allows a living being to pass through the time stream. It is here that she first meets Klyde, Gramp's 15 ft. gorilla who has been accidentally altered by the body enhancer. Gramp then enhances Meriem as well, but accidentally instead of going 70 years into the future Gramp, Klyde and Meriem are transported 70 million years into the past. Thus the trio begins an ongoing adventure through time while on the run from dinosaurs and a secret branch of the government. Meriem and Gramp settle in a large cave and begin a struggle for survival. As events transpire, Gramp is killed early on by a Tyrannosaurus and Meriem leaves the cave. After a fierce fight with local carnivores, Meriem ends up naked when her clothes were torn off during the fight. After more than ten years, and growing into a buxom 19-year-old, Meriem lived in the local jungles naked, savage, happy, and free. Dinosaurs were taught to fear her. Meriem becomes reunited with Klyde, who attacks her and almost kills her. She then returns to the cave. Not wanting to be naked and savage anymore, she eventually makes a jungle bikini (with dinosaur teeth hanging on the strings) out of a leopard-printed snakeskin blanket. She also avenges her grandfather by slaying the Tyrannosaurus responsible for killing him, but rescues two Tyrannosaurus hatchlings from Velociraptors. One named Harmony becomes Meriem's companion while the other named Peace became her enemy. Later, the whole town of Marshville is transported into a prehistoric past. When this takes place, Meriem becomes their guide and protector in the prehistoric world. The civilians had to protect themselves from the dangerous dinosaurs by building an electric fence around Marshville. She eventually leads most of the Marshville citizens safely to the Pangaean Sea. Powers and abilities Meriem's various superhuman powers come from her enhanced molecular structure. It was altered and enhanced by Gramp, so that she could survive the rigors of time travel. Meriem stands at 5'8\\", weighs 350 lbs,Cavewoman #1, pg. 4 and possesses extraordinary strength and stamina. She is strong enough to rip a Velociraptor's arm out of its socket.Cavewoman: Rain #6, pg. 13 She has also picked up a downed street lamp.Cavewoman: Rain #5, pg. 33 Meriem's strength also allows her to leap lengthy distances, such as between buildings in New York City,Cavewoman: Pangaean Sea #2, pg. 18 or leaping onto the top of a truck's trailer from street level.Cavewoman: Rain #6, pg. 4 She is strong enough to leap through the forest with a full-grown man on her back. Meriem is also highly resistant to injury. A high-caliber gunshot to the backCavewoman: Pangaean Sea #2, pg. 5 and bites from Velociraptors have failed to penetrate her tough skin. She can survive falls from great heights, such as when she fell from a cliff to the beach. Things that have been proven able to penetrate her skin, or otherwise injure her, are attacks that are directed with great strength or force, such as a Tyrannosaurus bite, Klyde's blows, or armor- piercing ammunition. Meriem's enhanced molecular structure gives her an enhanced healing effect that reduces the healing time of wounds. The effect is hastened proportionally to her food intake: the more food consumed, the more quick the healing. Meriem always gets hungry after she gets injured. Meriem has healed dinosaur bites, armor-piercing bullet wounds, and even a Yeti yanking off all of her head hair: the next morning she had grown her hair back. The worst injury Meriem is shown taking is when she battled a berserk Klyde during Cavewoman: Rain. Klyde beats her to the extent that she stops breathing and appears dead. She remains in this \\"death state\\" while her enhanced molecular structure slowly repairs itself, without Meriem being able to eat anything to hasten the healing process. The citizens of Marshville bury her, thinking she is truly dead, though the healing effect repairs the damage after two weeks. Meriem also has above average running speed, described as moving at \\"30 miles per hour\\". Once, when she ran, her boyfriend Bruce had to ride after her on his motorcycle in order to keep up with her.Cavewoman#2, pg. 24 She is an extremely powerful swimmer and can hold her breath for long periods when fighting underwater. She has also proven resistant to the effects of drowning, being capable of expelling water from her lungs even when unconscious. Meriem's senses of smell and hearing are also enhanced. In addition, she has psychic powers, the limits of which have not been revealed. She can see Gramp as a kind of spirit who appears to her from time to time, offering advice and insight. No one can see or hear Gramp but Meriem. She has psychic bonds with Klyde and Harmony. Meriem's sight is also extremely good: she can see an ant up to two miles away. She is also an expert knife thrower, and can decapitate a pterodactyl with a thrown blade. She is also highly efficient with a knife in hand-to-hand combat, and is also an expert with a spear. Meriem is also accomplished in wrestling and boxing.

San Carlos de R√≠o Negro is a small city of about 1200 inhabitants in the Venezuelan state of Amazonas. It serves as the administrative capital of the municipal district of R√≠o Negro, inhabited primarily by Amerindian people, in particular the Yanomami and Baniwa (Kurripako) peoples. It sits on the opposite side of the Rio Negro from the Colombian city of San Felipe.  History  The city of San Carlos de R√≠o Negro was founded in 1759 as a camp set up by the expedition captained by Jos√© Solano y Bote. The expedition moved into the area to explore the extent of the limits of exploration as defined by the Treaty of Madrid between the Crowns of Portugal and Spain. Jos√© Solano y Bote set up his exploration base there on the banks of the Rio Negro with the few men that had survived the trek up the Orinoco River. Most of the men that accompanied the expedition, including the famous Swedish botanist Pehr L√∂fling, succumbed to tropical diseases, especially yellow fever. In May 1800, the explorers Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland visited the town, constituting the southernmost point of their expedition of the Amazon Basin.  Geography  The city is located a few kilometers from the mouth of the Casiquiare canal, an important fluvial artery that connects the Amazon Basin with the Orinoco River, thus uniting Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil, and is above sea level. Within the city is a rocky formation called Piedra del Cocuy, an excellent climbing place in one of the most bio-diverse areas on Earth. = Travel = Because of its remote location, there are few ways to get into and out of the city.

He shares the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. He split with the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1991 to form Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) and the multi-sectoral group Sanlakas. From the split, he led the formation of the Partido ng Manggagawang Pilipino (Filipino Workers' Party), an underground revolutionary socialist party, which, after his death, merged with the Sosyalistang Partido ng Paggawa (Socialist Party of Labor) and the Partido para sa Proletaryong Demokrasya (Party for Proletarian Democracy). During the First Quarter Storm, he was a member of Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (Democratic Association of the Youth) in the 1970s. After only a year in college at the University of the Philippines, he decided to go underground and do full-time organizing work in the factories and urban poor communities in the northern sector of Metro Manila. Ka Popoy was elected Secretary of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee of the CPP in the mid-70's and spearheaded the broad formation which challenged the Marcos dictatorship in 1978 Batasan Pambansa elections. The Central Committee of the CPP admonished Ka Popoy and the whole regional committee for advocating participation in 1978 Batasan Pambansa elections because it ran counter to the CC call to head to the counryside to wage armed struggle against the dictatorship. Ka Popoy was only to return at the helm of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee after the EDSA uprising of 1986. In spite of the differences with the central leadership, Ka Popoy strived harder to strengthen revolutionary work in the capital city. Ka Popoy is also known to be the only Party leader that during the struggles with the CPP that put forward the most comprehensive and in- depth critique against the basic Party documents of CPP-NPA which are now popularly known as Counter-Thesis 1 (PSR: A Semi-feudal Alibi for Protracted War, PPDR: Class Line vs. Mass Line and PPW: A New-Type Revolution of the Wrong Type) and Counter-Thesis 2 (On the Reorientation of the Party Work and the Reorganization of the Party Machinery). He was shot dead in Bahay ng Alumni, University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City on February 8, 2001. His assassination is widely speculated to have been carried out by his former associates in the Communist Party. The assassins and the culprits have not yet been apprehended as of 2008. On July 2007, the Quezon City Prosecutor‚Äôs Office decided to drop the case on eight suspected communist assassins since the witnesses were unable to attend the preliminary investigations. Personal life Filemon grew up in Caloocan City. He was a track and field athlete of Caloocan High School. He was of short stature (perhaps about 5'6\\" in height). His belligerence started to manifest during his early high school days whenever he voices out his communistic beliefs by being argumentative against a few teachers that contradicted his ideologies. Then Superintendent of City Schools, Mrs. Modesta G. Boquiren \\"played politics\\" and heeded his voice on occasions by not contradicting him. Lagman found friendship with Mrs. Boquiren's nephew Florante \\"Randy\\" Deguzman as his temporary running mate in high school. Filemon graduated in 1970 while Florante in 1971. They've lost contact in College days. Filemon's first wife was Dodi Garduce, while second wife was Bobbie Jopson (sister of another revolutionary martyr Edgar Jopson, owners of Jopson's Supermarket in Sampaloc, Manila). His brother is current Albay congressman Edcel Lagman. Death and Legacy When Martial Law was declared on 21 September 1972, Lagman established the first network of the underground revolutionary movement in Navotas. He organized, along with his comrades, the labor unions in factories and other work sites, launched mass mobilizations, developed a political mass base among workers and recruited more party members for the CPP. At the height of the CPP split, Lagman wrote the biggest critique on CPP founding chair Jose Maria Sison's book Philippine Society and Revolution--the Counter- thesis.Guidote, Caridad. The Intellectuals and the Problems of Development in the Philippines. 1973.Amado Guerrero (1970). Philippine Society and Revolution. Revolutionary School of Mao Tsetung Thought. Lagman argued in his critique that Philippine society was capitalist in a backward and underdeveloped way, rather than being semi-feudal and semi-colonial. Lagman thus posited that a workers-led revolution must be waged to dismantle capitalism, instead of a protracted people's war from the countryside. Lagman was ambushed and shot to death by two unknown assassins on the afternoon of 6 February 2001, at the east-side steps of the University of the Philippines Bahay ng Alumni in Diliman, Quezon City. At the time of his death, Ka Popoy was working on the launch of the Partido ng Manggagawa, the workers' political party that would participate in the 2001 mid-term elections, among other revolutionary tasks for the Filipino working class.

He was the fourth son and sixth of eight children of Rev. Daniel Crosby Greene, a Congregational minister, and Mary Jane (Forbes) Greene. His parents, descendants of colonial Massachusetts families, had been among the earliest American missionaries in Japan, arriving in 1869 and serving until their deaths (the mother's in 1910, the father's in 1913); they were deeply involved in bringing modern Western education to the Japanese during the Meiji era. Two of their other children achieved prominence, Evarts Boutell as an American historian at Columbia and Jerome Davis Greene as a foundation administrator, banker, and secretary of the Corporation of Harvard University. Roger Greene was born in Westborough, Mass., while his parents were on furlough in the United States. After earlier schooling in Japan, he entered Harvard, from which he received a B.A. degree in 1901 and an M.A. the following year. He then obtained a position with the consular service and over the next twelve years held posts in Brazil, Japan, Siberia, and China; at Hankow (1911‚Äì1914) he performed with distinction as consul general during the Chinese revolution. Perhaps as a result of his missionary heritage, Greene became uncomfortable in his role as agent of the interests of the United States, feeling an obligation to mankind more broadly conceived. He therefore surrendered a highly promising diplomatic career to accept in 1914, an opportunity to join in the philanthropic activities of the Rockefeller Foundation, of which his brother Jerome was then secretary. Greene began as a member of the foundation's commission which surveyed the medical and public health needs of China. The commission's recommendations led to the establishment, later in 1914, of the China Medical Board, to foster medical education in China through the improvement of hospitals and medical schools and the granting of fellowships to missionary and Chinese physicians. Wallace Buttrick of the General Education Board accepted the directorship of the board, and Greene was made resident director in China. He remained in China until 1935, becoming director of the China Medical Board in 1921 and serving from 1927 to 1929 as vice- president of the Rockefeller Foundation in the Far East. He also took a particular interest in one of the board's projects, the Peking Union Medical College, and became acting director in 1927. During his years with the China Medical Board, Greene developed close ties with China's westernized intellectuals, most notably the philosopher-diplomat Hu Shih. He was deeply involved in projects directed toward the modernization of China, especially in the field of public health. He also kept up a steady correspondence with members of the Department of State responsible for American policy toward China. With China torn by civil strife in the 1920s, Greene urged a policy of noninterference, arguing that the Chinese were entitled to the freedom that Americans had enjoyed in the 1860s: the freedom to fight their civil war until one side won a decisive victory and could unify and determine the future of the country. In 1927-1928 he led a group of Americans in Peking, mostly missionaries, who successfully opposed a plan by the American minister for intervention in cooperation with the other great powers. Greene's opinion carried special weight at this time because Nelson T. Johnson, his former prot√©g√© in the consular service, had taken over responsibility for East Asian affairs within the State Department. Tension developed, however, between Greene and the Rockefeller Foundation. This was partly the result of Greene's character and style. To many he seemed the archetypical New Englander, austere, righteous, and rigid; and he was, indeed, highly principled and uncompromising. He regarded with contempt the increasing involvement of John D. Rockefeller III in China Medical Board affairs and would do nothing to appease that young man's sensibilities. A host of financial issues, born of the board's depression-ridden desire to cut expenses, served as irritants, but the major issue became the future of the department of religion at Peking Union Medical College. In founding the college in 1916, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., had acquired the facilities of a British missionary medical school and had declared his intention to continue the school's religious atmosphere. Greene, however, had come to believe that the effort to instill Christianity in medical and nursing students was an anachronism in modern China. As Chinese nationalism grew more intense in the 1920s and 1930s, both students and faculty objected to the department of religion. Regarding the department as expendable during the budget crisis, Greene fought hard for his beliefs, but lost out in a confrontation with the Rockefellers. He resigned from the China Medical Board in 1934, and later the same year, by direction of the board, submitted his resignation from the Peking Union Medical College as of July 1935. Greene emerged from semi-retirement in the late 1930s as a leader in organizations formed to work for the support of China and Great Britain against Japan and Germany. From 1938 to 1941 he served as chairman of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression and from 1940 to 1941 as associate director of William Allen White's Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. For both organizations he lobbied with federal officials for American assistance to China. More than any other private citizen, Greene had the attention of Stanley K. Hornbeck, the State Department's powerful senior advisor for Far Eastern Affairs. Almost alone, he kept the Committee to Defend America from focusing its entire campaign on the war in Europe. Ill health curtailed Greene's activities shortly before Pearl Harbor, but he was able during the war to serve part-time as a consultant to the State Department's Division of Cultural Relations. He maintained a deep interest in Chinese affairs, and while he gradually, with misgivings, came to regard the Kuomintang as China's best hope, he was outraged by the attacks on John S. Service and other Americans who had reported favorably on Chinese Communist activities. He also lent active encouragement to the development of East Asian studies in the United States. Greene's home in his later years was Worcester, Massachusetts. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida, of cardiac failure and chronic nephritis and was buried in Westborough, Mass. He was survived by his wife, Kate Brown, whom he had married on May 8, 1920, and their two children, Edward Forbes and Katharine Curtis. He was also the great- great grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. Further reading [Greene's papers, at Harvard, are a basic source.

Palacios is Peru's record cap holder and played most of his career for Sporting Cristal, which was the team he started his career and later retired with at the end of the 2011 season.  Early life  Roberto Palacios grew up in the Chorrillos District in Lima. Palacios was introduced to soccer at an early age by his soccer-loving dad, and he played on regional teams in his early years . Club career Palacios became a player of Sporting Cristal, where he played in his youth. Palacios made his debut with Sporting Cristal in 1991, when his team faced Deportivo Municipal in late October 1991. Palacios then scored his first goal in the following week against Universitario de Deportes. Palacios was a successful player, and scored many goals for both his clubs and the National Team. He is nicknamed \\"El Chorrillano\\" or \\"Chorri\\". He was regarded, at his peak, by some as one of the best Peruvian players of the 90's. In Peru, Palacios has only played for one club, Sporting Cristal. Outside of Peru he has played for several clubs such as Puebla F.C. (Mexico), Cruzeiro Esporte Clube (Brasil), Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara (Mexico), Monarcas Morelia (Mexico), Deportivo Cali (Colombia) and Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito from Ecuador. While playing for LDU Quito, \\"Chorri\\" was involved in a fight\\"Barcelona vs liga pu√±etiza\\", YouTube. Retrieved 20 January 2012. and got suspended. This was caused because he scored a chalaca goal. International career \\"Chorri\\" was well known for his amazing 'chorrigolazos' (for his ability to surprise top goalkeepers by scoring from far away despite his small size) which nearly took Peru to the last 3 FIFA World Cups. Palacios had a long run with the Peru national football team that resulted in a record 128 caps and 19 goals for his country. He retired from the Peruvian National squad on May 25, 2012. Outside football Roberto Palacios and his father were part of the Million Man March. Palacios is also a children's activist. He frequently works with UNICEF to help feed the poor children of Africa, and sometimes even by flying over and donating football gear and accessories.

Welcome page verified 2010-12-18.<\\\\--Defunct reference, April 2017. The museum has been advertised as Louisiana's Civil War Museum and as Louisiana's Oldest Museum. This \\"Adjunct of the Howard Memorial Library Association\\", according to Frank T. Howard's letter of 8 Jan. 1891, was placed in the \\"possession\\" the Board of Governors of the Louisiana Historical Association \\"to be set apart forever for the use of\\" that organization. Sully & Toledano designed the hall, which was completed in 1888, following the Richardsonian Romanesque style of the Howard Library designed by H.H. Richardson. Collections The Confederate Memorial Hall contains over 5,000 historical artifacts including several rare Civil War items. It holds the personal effects and uniforms of Confederate generals Braxton Bragg and P.G.T. Beauregard, as well as over 140 regimental and other C.S.A. flags. Jefferson Davis' wife Varina Davis donated several of her late husband's belongings to the museum including items of clothing, his Bible and saddle, plus a crown of thorns from Pope Pius IX. 19th-century history Confederate Memorial Hall was established in 1891 by New Orleans philanthropist Frank T. Howard, to house the historical collections of the Louisiana Historical Association.Confederated Southern Memorial Association. 1904. History of the Confederated Memorial Associations of the South. Page 198. The museum quickly accumulated a vast collection of Civil War items, mostly in the form of personal donations by veterans. On 29 May 1893, the exhumed body of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was mourned by over 60,000 people as it lay in state in the hall, before being moved to his final resting place in Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia). Ownership dispute For much of its existence the Confederate Memorial Hall's building has been the subject of an ownership dispute that has involved numerous court battles and the involvement of several Louisiana political figures including Governors Huey Long and Mike Foster. The dispute has revolved around Howard's original donation of the building to the Louisiana Historical Association, which read \\"It is with deep satisfaction that I perform the act of formally putting into your possession the Building, which, while it is an Adjunct of the Howard Memorial Library Association, is to be set apart forever for the use of your organization.\\" In 1930 the adjoining Howard Library sought the museum's building space to store portions of their collection. Governor Long negotiated a compromise in which the museum permitted the library to store some of its books in their basement. In the 1940s the Howard Library outgrew its facilities and relocated to Tulane University. Its building was sold shortly afterwards and, after transferring to several owners, was donated to the University of New Orleans in the early 1990s. The old Howard Library building and a nearby property neighboring the Confederate Memorial Hall were then converted into the Ogden Museum of Southern Art by UNO. The location of Memorial Hall in between the two Ogden buildings gave rise to the latest dispute over the property, as visitors to the Ogden museums would have to exit each building and travel outdoors around the Memorial Hall to reach the remainder of the collection. A solution was proposed in which a tunnel between the two buildings through the Memorial Hall basement would be constructed and a proposal was drafted by Confederate Memorial Hall, but UNO withdrew from the negotiations in 1998. 21st century In 2000, Tulane University, having absorbed the Howard Library, sold its title to the Memorial Hall building to UNO, which it claimed to possess as the former owner of the Howard Library properties. In 2001 the UNO foundation announced its claims to the Confederate Memorial Hall building and initiated efforts to remove the museum from the premises. A series of court battles ensued in which title ownership to the property was granted to UNO, however efforts to evict the museum were stayed by the courts on bonds. As the case proceeded through the appellate processes, Governor Mike Foster intervened in the dispute and assisted in the drafting of a compromise between UNO and the museum that would allow Confederate Memorial Hall to remain in its historic building. In August 2003, at Foster's direction, both parties agreed to drop pending lawsuits to the building in exchange for fulfillment of a compromise agreement. Per the agreement, UNO is required to cede its title claims to the Confederate Memorial Hall museum's land and building in exchange for the construction of a connecting tunnel through the basement as was proposed in the 1997 plan. The compromise is to be implemented in full within 10 years time, or upon the completion of the tunnel, depending upon which comes first.Tulanelink. November 10, 2004.

It is characterized by high temperature, short duration, and a rapidly moving flame front. Definition A flash fire is defined by NFPA 2112NFPA 2112, Standard on Flame-Resistant Clothing for Protection of Industrial Personnel Against Short-Duration Thermal Exposures from Fire, 2018. as: :\\"A type of short-duration fire that spreads by means of a flame front rapidly through a diffuse fuel, such as dust, gas, or the vapors of an ignitable liquid, without the production of damaging pressure.\\" Characterization Flash fires may occur in environments where fuel, typically flammable gas or dust, is mixed with air in concentrations suitable for combustion. In a flash fire, the flame spreads at subsonic velocity, so the overpressure damage is usually negligible and the bulk of the damage comes from the thermal radiation and secondary fires. When inhaled, the heated air resulting from a flash fire can cause serious damage to the tissue of the lungs, possibly leading to death by asphyxiation. Flash fires can lead to smoke burns. Flash fire is a particular danger in enclosed spaces, as even a relatively small fire can consume enough oxygen and produce enough smoke to cause death of the persons present, whether by asphyxiation or by smoke inhalation. Protective clothing made of fire-retardant materials (e.g. Nomex) reduces or prevents thermal injury in the body areas that are covered by the fire-retardant material. Even normal clothing can provide partial protection. Surgical Small flash fires can occur in the operating room during surgery where the presence of ignition sources such as electrical instruments or lasers, an oxygen-rich environment, and flammable vapors (e.g. alcohol-based disinfectants) may set the stage for such an accident. While apparently smaller fires go unreported, surgical flash fires have led to burn injuries and fatalities. Incidents of surgical fires are \\"significantly under- reported\\", according to The Joint Commission. More than half of surgical fires happen inside a patient's airway or on the patient's upper body; around 10 percent of surgical fires actually happen within the body cavity, and a quarter of surgical fires happen on other parts of the body. About 70 per cent are ignited by electrosurgical tools commonly known as Bovies, devices that use a high-frequency electric current to cut tissue or stop bleeding. 20 percent of fires are sparked by hot wires, light sources, burrs or defibrillators. Another 10 percent are touched off by lasers. As far as the patients are concerned, some recover with scars and emotional damage. Some die from burns and smoke inhalation.

He led the Top of the Pops orchestra for sixteen years, wrote a catalogue of library music, and had many of his pieces used as the theme music to television series. Early years Johnny Pearson was born John Valmore Pearson in Plaistow in the London Borough of Bromley, the only child of a steel erector. At age seven, Pearson began studying piano. By nine, he had won a scholarship with the London Academy of Music, where he spent four years under English pianist Solomon. In his teens, he would give classical recitals and start a jazz band, the Rhythm Makers. During World War II, Johnny Pearson served in the Royal Artillery Band. After the war, he became one of the founding members of the Malcolm Mitchell Trio in October 1948, before leaving in 1954 after Malcolm Mitchell broke up the group to start a solo career. During his time with the trio, Johnny Pearson toured England and Europe, playing the West End and theatres. The early Malcolm Mitchell Trio consisted of Malcolm Mitchell, Teddy Broughton and Johnny Pearson. After leaving the Malcolm Mitchell Trio, Pearson turned his talents to British radio, as well as performing in the Peter York Concert Orchestra. By 1960, he was conducting the Romance in Rhythm Orchestra.John Martland Article Music Club Record Label 1997 - The Best of Johnny Pearson and his Orchestra He recorded two singles for Parlophone, \\"Waterfall\\" in mid 1959, and \\"Theme from The L Shaped Room\\" in 1962. He was then offered a solo album deal with Oriole Records, which first teamed him up with John Schroeder. The Oriole album, Piano Sweet - Piano Wild was released in 1962 and was Johnny Pearson's first full vinyl album release. Also there was a 45 single released, \\"Ooh La La\\", in 1962 but this track and its b-side did not appear on the album. After the Oriole releases, Johnny Pearson continued to perform with various concert orchestras until 1964. Working with Cilla Black In early 1964, Johnny Pearson took part in helping launch the career of Cilla Black, a rising singer who had been spotted by The Beatles producer, George Martin. She had released her first 45 single, \\"Love of the Loved\\", in 1963, but it had charted only modestly despite having been written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A scout for George Martin had spotted the track \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\" after hearing the US singer Dionne Warwick's version. Originally the song was to have been recorded in the UK by Shirley Bassey, but George Martin saw the piece as being more suitable for Black's voice. Early in 1964, \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\" was recorded by Cilla Black at London's Abbey Road Studios, in an arrangement by Pearson which featured the use of bassoons. In February 1964, it entered the UK Singles Chart, eventually reaching number 1 in both the UK and Ireland and also charting in other parts of Europe. The Dionne Warwick version was also in the UK charts at the time (although it only managed to peak at Number 42), but Cilla Black's treatment used slightly different lyrics and a different arrangement. Following the success of \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\", Pearson was invited to work on the next Cilla Black single, \\"You're My World\\", which was released in May 1964. This was also recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and again went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. Pearson also worked on other Cilla Black tracks, some of which featured on her album, Cilla Sings a Rainbow. Sounds Orchestral Sounds Orchestral was an idea by John Schroeder, who had moved from Oriole Records to become the label manager at Pye Records and was interested in producing an instrumental version of the US hit song \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\". This had been suggested to him at the time by Pye staff member, Tony Reeves. As his project moved to fruition, Schroeder looked for a piano player. His efforts came about when he was reminded of Johnny Pearson from a few years earlier, after he heard him on Radio Luxembourg. Initially paid a session fee to record \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\", Pearson was subsequently made a full partner in the Sounds Orchestral project.John Schroeder, April 1991- Sequel Records Cast Your Fate Album CD reissue covernotes \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\" was a number 5 hit in the UK Singles Chart in early 1965. Sounds Orchestral would end up recording some seventeen albums between 1965 and 1977. Some have subsequently been reissued on CD. Top of the Pops Pearson first appeared on the BBC music show Top of the Pops in January 1965 playing piano with Sounds Orchestral on \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\", which charted at the time. The following year in 1966, Pearson took charge of the Top of the Pops Orchestra, established after the Musicians' Union forbade miming on televised musical performances. By the summer of 1980, the Musicians' Union went on strike after budget cuts led to the BBC terminating several orchestras, including that of Top of the Pops. During the strike, Top of the Pops was off the air from June to August 1980. Pearson continued contributing to the programme until the 900th episode in the summer of 1981. Pearson's arrangement for the Top of the Pops Orchestra of Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" was the theme tune to Top of the Pops for most of the 1970s.  The Dusty Springfield TV Series During 1966, as well as Top of the Pops, Johnny Pearson worked and directed the orchestra for the Dusty Springfield shows which were recorded by the BBC, for television. It featured Johnny Pearson directing a full 32 piece orchestra. There were a total of twelve episodes made, six in 1966 and six in 1967. In recent years, the surviving nine episodes have been remastered and released as \\"Dusty Springfield Live at the BBC\\", on DVD. KPM In 1966, Johnny Pearson also started his long association with the KPM library record label. KPM was originally known as Keith Prowse Music. KPM would later become part of the EMI Group of companies but was able to retain its independence due to its specialist nature. Pearson's involvement with KPM was to last many years until 1978, which is when he switched over his music library efforts to Bruton Music. Johnny Pearson would however again later return to KPM during 1988. That year's KPM 1000 Series double release Johnny Pearson Piano and Orchestra included several pieces featured in the second run of All Creatures Great and Small, which did not have the accompanying soundtrack release that the original run did. Johnny Pearson's earliest contributions at KPM came in the form of contributing to KPM's in house orchestra, the Group-Forty Orchestra. KPM's Group-Forty Orchestra was an orchestra that existed between 1959 and 1966. Its role was to record background music for radio and television. From 1967, Johnny Pearson started appearing on many of KPM's music library recordings, in his own right. The Carpenters In October 1971, Johnny Pearson helped produce the BBC Television special, Carpenters: Live at the BBC, featuring the American musical duo of Karen and Richard Carpenter. It was broadcast the following month on British TV and elsewhere. In early 1973, Pearson was again contacted by Richard Carpenter to ask permission to use one of his songs, on the then forthcoming Carpenters LP, Now & Then. This track, originally titled \\"Autumn Reverie\\", first appeared on the 1968 KPM album, Gentle Sounds, and was retitled \\"Heather\\" by producer John Bettis in the Carpenters' version. Richard Carpenter apparently first heard the track as background music for a commercial for the US health food supplement maker, Geritol, and loved it straight away.Interview with Richard Carpenter by Mike Ragogna, The Huffington Post, on 11 May 2009 \\"Autumn Reverie\\" would also feature again on the 1974 Johnny Pearson LP Touch Me in the Morning, and as background music on the British television series, All Creatures Great and Small (1978‚Äì90). Johnny Pearson and his Orchestra As leader of the Johnny Pearson Orchestra, he reached number 8 in the United Kingdom chart in early 1972 with \\"Sleepy Shores\\", the theme from the television series Owen, M.D. (1971‚Äì73). The Johnny Pearson Orchestra, which as a musical project was begun in 1972, ran side by side with his other projects. At the time, these projects included working on albums with John Schroeder for Sounds Orchestral and also providing library music to Britain's KPM Records. Instead of the slightly jazzy sounding, Sounds Orchestral albums, Pearson was offered a project for easy listening and romance music, based on the success of his \\"Sleepy Shores\\" hit. This time he teamed up with music executive Larry Page, who wanted to move his label Penny Farthing into the easy listening genre. The albums were released outside the UK in Europe, Australia, Canada and the US. In 1978, Larry Page decided to rename his Penny Farthing label to Rampage Records, to reflect a more modern outlook. One of the first singles and albums from the Rampage label, would be another of Pearson's international hits, the eponymous theme from All Creatures Great and Small. Library and theme music=In the United Kingdom= Pearson was a successful composer of theme music for television series. Examples of his work included The Rat Catchers, All Creatures Great and Small, General Hospital, Captain Pugwash, Triangle, 3-2-1, Mary Mungo & Midge and ITN's News at Ten (the last of which formed part of \\"The Awakening\\", a piece otherwise known to American audiences as the main title theme to the 1974 animated film Journey Back to Oz). He also wrote the scores to Michael Winner's swinging 60's comedy film The Jokers (1967), the Robert Horton TV spy movies The Spy Killer (1969) and Foreign Exchange (1970), the Grampian Television start-up music \\"Sounds On\\", and the ATV startup theme \\"Midlands Montage\\", as well as music used during intervals between schools programmes on ITV. =In the United States= In the United States, Pearson's best-known composition is \\"Heavy Action\\", originally used as the theme to the BBC sports show Superstars, and subsequently adopted by ABC's Monday Night Football (the NFL's weekly nationally televised showcase) and the SFM Holiday Network. In 1989, Edd Kalehoff composed and recorded a new arrangement of this music for later seasons of Monday Night Football. His piece \\"Graveyard\\" was used in The Ren and Stimpy Show and SpongeBob SquarePants, and his piece \\"Mini Walking\\" was used on Sesame Street as the score for the animated story segment Nancy the Nannygoat by Tee Collins and part of the score for Bill Cosby's Aesop's Fables animated special from Filmation. NFL Films has used many of his other compositions for its Super Bowl and other highlight films. Pearson's \\"Power Drive\\" was known in the U.S. and Canada for use in some episodes of the 1967-70 cartoon series Spider-Man, as well as being the theme for Los Angeles station KNXT/KCBS-TV's afternoon movie series The Early Show for much of the 1970s and into the 1980s, as well as for their Saturday night movie show The Fabulous 52 from the late 1960s until the end of its run in 1974. \\"Power Drive\\" and \\"Evening Sky,\\" among others, were also used as background music by NFL Films. =In Australia= In Australia, his best-known library music piece was \\"Power Drive,\\" which was used as the theme for the 1969-75 police drama Division 4. Some of Johnny Pearson's library music was also used as background scene music for the Ten Network series, Prisoner. Also during late 2011, another Johnny Pearson track, And a Very Good Morning to You, from 1970, was used as a piece of background music, on the Nine Network series, Underbelly. The track \\"Sleepy Shores\\" was also used as incidental music in some of the courting scenes from the 1970s ABC TV drama series, Certain Women. =In the Netherlands= In the 1970s, Johnny Pearson composed the music score for the Dutch TV series Sil de Strandjutter, performed by his orchestra. Pearson's composition \\"Heather\\", as performed by the Carpenters, has served as the background music to the \\"Plaat & zijn Verhaal\\"-section (\\"A record and its story\\") at Radio Veronica, in which a song's lyrics are translated into Dutch and read by the DJ. This composition, in the Carpenters' version, was also the last music to be heard before Radio Veronica went off the air in 1974. The 1980s and later After leaving Top of the Pops, Pearson continued to work on independent projects throughout the 1980s. In 1982, released the instrumental album On Golden Pond through Larry Page's Page One Records. In 1984, Pearson assembled another orchestra, the Johnny Pearson Studio Orchestra, and contributed to John Paul Jones' motion picture soundtrack, Scream For Help. Following this, during 1985, he worked on producing music for the BBC TV production drama Maelstrom. Notable on the recordings for Maelstrom is the track \\"Camellia Waltz\\", which was treated to sound like an old 78rpm record. Other tracks by Pearson for the series came from his work with KPM. In 1987, together with business partner Adrian Kerridge, Pearson negotiated the purchase of CTS Studios, in Wembley.History of CTS Studios In 1988, he returned to the KPM record label and the recording of two new library CDs for the radio and television industry. Both were recorded at CTS Studios in Wembley, with Adrian Kerridge. After the 1980s, Pearson made occasional live appearances as part of a quartet. During 1993, Johnny Pearson worked with Shirley Bassey on a new album recording. Titled \\"Shirley Bassey sings the songs of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\", this was recorded at the CTS Studios. With Johnny Pearson mainly conducting, the album was subsequently released through EMI. More recently, it has now been reissued on compact disc. In 1996, Johnny Pearson recorded a CD of library music, for the radio and television industry, titled Simply Piano. This was followed in 2005 by another CD, Simply Piano 2. Death Johnny Pearson died at the age of 85, on 20 March 2011. He is survived by Alex, his wife of many years whom he married in 1963. Discography Johnny Pearson at one time had at least four different projects going at the same time: Sounds Orchestral, as pianist; Johnny Pearson and his Orchestra; work with KPM Records, with background music for radio and television; and as arranger with Top of the Pops.

Standard Gas and Electric Company, 306 U.S. 307 (1939), was an important United States Supreme Court case in United States corporate law that laid down the \\"Deep Rock doctrine\\" as a rule of bankruptcy and corporate law. This holds that claims, as creditors, upon an insolvent subsidiary company by controlling shareholders or other insiders, like managers or directors, will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors. Facts The Deep Rock Oil Corporation was an undercapitalized subsidiary of the defendant Standard Gas Company. Judgment The Supreme Court held that, where a subsidiary corporation declares bankruptcy and an insider or controlling shareholder of that subsidiary corporation asserts claims as a creditor against the subsidiary, loans made by the insider to the subsidiary corporation may be deemed to receive the same treatment as shares of stock owned by the insider. Therefore, the insider's claims will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors, i.e. other creditors will be paid first, and if there is nothing left after other creditors are paid then the insider gets nothing. This also applies (and indeed the doctrine was first established) where a parent company asserts such claims against its own subsidiary. The doctrine will be applied where equity requires, particularly where the subsidiary was undercapitalized at the time that it was established, and can thereby be shown to have been mismanaged for the parent corporation's benefit.

It began on January 20, 1917, as the Association of American Horse Shows, later changed to the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA). In 2001, the organization changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) and, in 2003 it merged with the United States Equestrian Team (USET). In 2017, USEF rebranded as US Equestrian. In 2019, USEF abandoned and sold its own laboratory to the University of Kentucky. Competitions governed by US Equestrian include dressage, driving, endurance riding, eventing, hunt seat equitation, hunter, jumper, para-equestrian, reining, roadster, saddle seat equitation, vaulting, and western riding competition including equitation, western pleasure, reining, trail, western dressage, and related events. The organization also governs breed shows held in the United States for the Andalusian, Lusitano, Arabian, Half-Arabian/Anglo-Arabian, Connemara, Friesian, Hackney, Morgan, American Saddlebred, National Show Horse, Paso Fino, Shetland, and Welsh breeds. US Equestrian keeps track of yearly points accumulated at individual horse shows throughout the year and gives awards based on these points at the end of the year. Horse shows governed under the USEF are given an AA, A, B, or C rating. Shows with an AA rating are the most prestigious and often offer the most prize money, whereas shows with a C rating are more local, usually awarding less prize money. Competitions recognized by the USEF must follow its rules and bylaws.

Vanderbilt. Their intention was to unite in order to assure clean competition in the show ring. They formed the Association of American Horse Shows, which by its first annual meeting on January 29, 1918, included the organizers of 26 well-known horse shows. The association incorporated in June 1918. Membership grew to list 35 member shows in 1919, and 67 shows by 1924. By the time of Vanderbilt's death in 1925, the organization had enrolled almost 70 shows as members of the organization. Alfred B. Maclay was the next individual elected president. Early in his term, in 1927, the association printed its first set of rules, consisting of a six- page pamphlet. The rules were revised continually and have been added to throughout the history of the association. When Maclay's term ended in 1936, membership included 183 shows. Maclay was followed by Pierre Lorillard as president. He served a year before Adrian Van Sinderen was elected. Under Van Sinderen, the office was relocated to 90 Broad Street in Manhattan. By the end of Van Sinderen's tenure in 1960, the rule book had grown to one hundred and sixty-eight pages. The need for show stewards, representatives of the association to be present at and report on recognized shows, was recognized in the minutes of a 1930 executive committee meeting. It was not until the 1948 rule book that stewards were written in, however, and not until the 1960 rule book that licensing of stewards was in place and recognized in the rules. In February 1933 the original name, the Association of American Horse Shows, Inc., was changed to the American Horse Shows Association, Inc. At the same meeting, individual members were recognized in addition to show members. In 1935, a committee reported on their investigation of the transfer of control of the United States' membership in the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) membership from the United States Cavalry Association to the AHSA. The transfer of membership took place after the 1936 Summer Olympics, and after that, in the United States, the FEI rules applied only to international military classes. By this time, AHSA membership had grown to include 183 members and shows. By 1937, the new rule book reflected the growth of the association by dividing the United States into five zones, each with a vice president and a five-member regional committee. In 1939, the association began publication of the monthly magazine, Horse Show, with an initial circulation of 1,200 copies. By this time there were 187 recognized shows, and 800 individual members. In 1960, the association began sending licensed stewards to each affiliated show to report and verify that the show was following the association's rules. In 1999, the association moved from its Manhattan office to the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky. In 2001, AHSA changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) to represent the organization's role more effectively in the United States. At that time, the organization had over 80,000 individual members. There were more than 2,700 member competitions, 100 affiliate organizations, and 26 breeds and disciplines were recognized. In 2003, USA Equestrian and the United States Equestrian Team (USET) joined together to take on responsibilities as a national governing body and became the United States Equestrian Federation.

The term \\"quartzose sandstone\\" can also be used for a quartz arenite. Quartz arenites are the most mature sedimentary rocks possible, and are often referred to as ultra- or super-mature, and are usually cemented by silica.

The two primary sedimentary depositional environments that produce quartz arenites are beaches/upper shoreface and aeolian processes,Prothero, D.

The older Fort St. Philip is located opposite of Fort Jackson on the eastern bank; this West Bank fort was constructed after the War of 1812 on the advice of Andrew Jackson, for whom it is named. The fort was occupied off and on for various military purposes from its completion until after World War I, when it served as a training station. It is now a National Historic Landmark and historical museum owned and operated by Plaquemines Parish. Fort Jackson was the site of the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip from April 16 to April 28, 1862, during the American Civil War. The Confederate-controlled fort was besieged for 12 days by the fleet of U.S. Navy Flag Officer David Farragut. Fort Jackson fell on April 28 after the Union fleet bombarded it and then sailed past its guns. A mutiny against the officers and conditions then occurred and the fort fell to the Union. Union forces then went on to capture New Orleans.North & South, Volume 11, Number 2, Page 18, accessed April 16, 2010, \\"Mutiny at Fort Jackson\\" Following the engagement, Fort Jackson was used as a Union prison.

The fort was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina's storm surge in 2005. Between Katrina and Hurricane Rita the following month, much of the fort sat under water for up to six weeks. Many of the historic exhibits in the fort were destroyed, and the fort itself suffered structural damage. The fort was used to treat oily birds in the early weeks of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Born in Loudun, Renaudot received a doctorate of medicine from the University of Montpellier in 1606. He returned to Loudon where he met Cardinal Richelieu and P√®re Joseph. In the 1610s, Richelieu became more powerful and Renaudot followed him to Paris. Renaudot, born a Protestant, converted to Catholicism. He became the physician of Louis XIII of France. In 1630, Renaudot opened the bureau d'adresse et de rencontre, where prospective employers and employees could find each other. With the support of Richelieu, he established the first weekly newspaper in France, La Gazette, in 1631. Starting in 1633, he organized weekly public conferences on subjects of interest and published the proceedings; the conferences were discontinued in 1642, when Richelieu died. About 240 conference proceedings were translated into English and published in London in 1664 and 1665. Renaudot opened the mont-de-pi√©t√©, the first pawnshop in Paris, in 1637. Appointed \\"General Overseer of the Poor\\" by Richelieu, he initiated a system of free medical consultations for the poor (1640). In 1642 he published a self-diagnostic handbook, the first treatise on diagnosis in France. After the deaths of his benefactors, Richelieu and Louis XIII, Renaudot lost his permission to practice medicine in Paris, due to the opposition of Guy Patin and other academic physicians.

It is the fourth installment in the handheld version of the Mega Man series. The game continues the quest of the protagonist Mega Man in the struggle with his long-time nemesis Dr. Wily, who sends out a disruptive radio signal to cause a rampage, citywide destruction from dormant robots. Mega Man IV features the traditional action platforming gameplay of the prior games while introducing one new feature, the ability to purchase items with power- ups found throughout each stage. As with previous Game Boy releases, the game incorporates gameplay elements and bosses from two sequential Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5. The game has received a warm critical reception. In 2013, Mega Man IV was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year. Plot The plot of the game once again involves the protagonist Mega Man trying to thwart the world domination plans of the infamous Dr. Wily. On a seemingly peaceful day in a large city, Wily appears in the sky in his flying saucer and sends out a radio transmission that causes all the robots at the annual Robot Master Exposition to go on a rampage. He then sends eight new rebuilt robots of his own to different parts of the city to lead the destruction. Having resisted this reprogramming signal, Mega Man responds by defeating all four of these previous foes in battle and chases Wily to a large tank. Inside the tank, the hero encounters Ballade, yet another robot specially designed to kill him. Mega Man defeats this new enemy, pursues the remaining enemies in the city, and returns to the tank. There, he has a victorious rematch with Ballade, only to see Wily quickly retreat to his space station. Dr. Light fits Mega Man's companion Rush with a space flight ability, allowing the hero to lead a one-man assault on Wily's new stronghold. Mega Man beats Wily, but is unable to blast his way out of the exploding space station. At the last moment, Ballade arrives and self-destructs in repentance, creating a hole through which Mega Man can safely escape. Gameplay At its core, the gameplay is still the same as the previous 3 Mega Man Game Boy games. The player takes on the role of Mega Man as he traverses a series of two sets of selectable action/platforming stages in any order desired. The player's initial weapon, the \\"Mega Buster\\", can fire both small shots and much larger and more powerful, charged blasts. Each stage is populated with various types of enemy robots and a single Robot Master exclusive boss. Beating the Robot Master will earn the player its special \\"Master Weapon\\" for use throughout the rest of the game. Clearing 2 of the Robot stages also gives the player access to abilities from Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a springboard for reaching high platforms or a jet for crossing large distances. Also, the game's first four Robot stages each house a letter (\\"B-E-A-T\\") that spell out the name of the bird Beat. Collecting all 4 letters endows the player the ability to summon upon Beat to assist by attacking enemies. On the other hand, the game's latter four Robot stages each house letters that spell (\\"W-I-L-Y\\") which would be imperative to collect in entering to the first part of Dr. Wily's fortress. The stages also contain hidden passages where the character Proto Man leaves the player items, often giving \\"Super Tanks\\" that refill all weapons energy and health energy. Mega Man IV carries on the Game Boy line's tradition of recycling elements from two consecutive Mega Man NES releases, most prominently with its bosses. The first four Robot Masters (Toad Man, Bright Man, Pharaoh Man, and Ring Man) are originally from Mega Man 4 and the latter four (Crystal Man, Napalm Man, Stone Man, and Charge Man) are from Mega Man 5. Mega Man IV also introduces a shop feature to the series. In addition to various restorative items like health, weapon power, extra lives, energy tanks that can be stored for later use, the player can pick up \\"Power Chips (P-Chips)\\" dropped by enemies or in designated spots in the stages. Dr. Light's lab can also be visited from the stage select screen, wherein the player can purchase various items using the P-Chips collected. One such item is the newly introduced \\"Auto Charger\\" (or \\"Energy Balancer\\", which was originally conceived for Mega Man 5 but removed), which automatically takes weapon energy capsules and restores it in the weapon with the least amount of energy left, provided that there is no refillable special weapon selected. Also, for the first time in the Mega Man Game Boy series, the Robot Master re- match sequence (where Mega Man must fight all 8 Robot Masters again in a teleportation hatch in Dr. Wily's castle) is implemented, as opposed to the previous three Mega Man Game Boy titles, where Mega Man fought Wily straight on after going through the castle. Development Using features from two previous NES titles, as well as some new elements, series artist Keiji Inafune was happy with the flow from Mega Man III to Mega Man IV. Inafune was also satisfied with how the Mega Man Killers Enker, Punk, and Ballade turned out. The artist had fun thinking up new ideas for Ballade's second form, which included the horns on his head turning up, larger bombs, and shades covering his eyes. Reception and legacy Mega Man IV has been well-received critically. Major gaming magazines Nintendo Power and Game Players have called the graphics and gameplay \\"exceptional\\" and \\"terrific\\", although the former was disappointed by its few surprises. Electronic Gaming Monthly described Mega Man IV as one of the best Game Boy games to date, due to its near flawless recreation of the action and technique of the home console games and graphics which push the Game Boy hardware \\"to its limits and then some\\" (though they did complain of screen blurring). They also praised the music and the extremely long, challenging levels. Mega Man IV was re-released on April 13, 2001 for the Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan alongside its four Game Boy counterparts. The 5 games that comprise this subseries were to be released on a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004, but was cancelled. The boss Ballade would later appear as part of a downloadable content stage for Mega Man 10 in 2010. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man IV is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console which came out in October 23, 2013 in Japan and on May 15, 2014 in North America.http://www.nintendo.com/eshop/mega-may Nintendo ReferencesExternal links *Official Rockman website Category:1993 video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Platform games Category:Mega Man (Original Series) Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Action video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Superhero video games Category:Mega Man spin-off games ","title":"Mega Man IV (Game Boy)"},{"id":"2297036","text":"Tanadgusix Corporation or TDX is a shareholder-owned Aleut Alaska Native village corporation founded in 1973.

Saint John Common Council consists of a mayor (chair) and 10 councillors. The city has a ward system with four of roughly equal population. This municipal arrangement was first adopted in the 2008 municipal election after a plebiscite held October 9, 2007. The mayor is directly elected along with two councillors that run at large. The councillor at large, which gains a plurality of votes, becomes the deputy mayor. Each ward elects two councillor. Since the incorporation of Saint John in 1785, the mayor has served as the chief representative of the city. Officeholders were first appointed by the Governor of New Brunswick, under an order in council. By the end of the end of the nineteenth century, the mayor was elected by the alderman of Common Council. In 1854, the office was directly elected by Saint John residents. As head of the largest city in New Brunswick, many mayors have served as elected officials at the federal and provincial level both before and after their tenure. Since 1785, 67 individuals have held the office of mayor. Notably, Samuel Davis, 1977-1980, served as the first elected Jewish Mayor of Saint John. In 1983 Elsie Wayne was elected the first woman mayor. She served until 1993. While serving only two years, Thomas J. Higgins was the first Catholic Mayor of Saint John.

It was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000. In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, as Land of Olives and Vines ‚Äî Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem, Battir. History=Antiquity= Ancient Betar, whose name Battir preserves, was a second-century Jewish village and fortress, the site of the final battle of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The modern Palestinian village is built north east of the ancient site Khirbet el-Yahud (Arabic, meaning \\"ruin of the Jews\\" ) and \\"is unanimously identified with Betar, the last stronghold of the Second Revolt against the Romans, where its leader, Bar-Kokhba, found his death in 135 CE.\\"David Ussishkin, \\"Soundings in Betar, Bar-Kochba's Last Stronghold\\"D.

It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all Muslims, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 Ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 115 In 1838 it was noted as Bittir, a Muslim village in the Beni Hasan district, west of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 123Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 324-325 French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the place in 1863,Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 387 ff while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count only included men. It was further noted that it had \\"a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the mosque\\".Socin, 1879, p. 148 It was also noted as located in the Beni Hasan districtHartmann, 1883, p. 122 also noted 62 houses In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. 20-21 In 1896 the population of Bettir was estimated to be about 750 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 125 In the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the railroad to Jerusalem, which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.A Window on the West Bank, by Bret Wallach Village women going to market, 1913 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jerusalem, p. 14 increasing in the 1931 census to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 37 In the 1945 statistics the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 24 with a total of 8,028 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 151 Battir train station 1934 =Jordanian era= During the 1948 war, most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking. The armistice line was drawn near the railroad, with Battir ending up just meters to the east of Jordan's border with Israel. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway, thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the Six-Day War. Battir came under Jordanian administration following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and was later, in a move not widely recognized internationally, annexed by Jordan on 24 April 1950 when the Jordanian parliament declared the unification of the two banks. The Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 23 = Post-1967= Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Battir has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 1445. Since the signing of the 1995 accords, it has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Battir is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of Battir land was classified as Area B, while the remaining 76.3% was classified as Area C. In 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967, in 2012 the population was estimated at about 4,500. Geography Battir is located 6.4 km (horizontal distance) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. \\"Valley of the Soldier\\"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain. The PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge. At an altitude of around 760 m above sea level, Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16o C. =Ancient irrigation system and terraces= Battir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates.West Bank barrier threatens villagers' way of life. BBC News. 2012-05-09. The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years.A Palestinian Village Tries to Protect a Terraced Ancient Wonder of Agriculture. The New York Times. 2012-06-25.Threatened village proposed as next UNESCO world heritage site . Ma'an News Agency. The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era Hejaz Railway was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir \\"a week lasts eight days, not seven.\\" According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of UNESCO, \\"There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village.\\" Battir's ancient terraces, 1893 In 2007, the village of Battir sued the Israeli Defense Ministry to try to force them to change the planned route of the Israeli West Bank barrier which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), which approved the fence‚Äôs original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir‚Äôs terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded, stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence. This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain ‚Äúwhy should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.‚Äù The Defense Ministry has to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013. A separate petition against the separation barrier has also been filed by the nearby Jewish city Beitar Illit, fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement. In 2011 UNESCO awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for \\"Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes\\" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system. In May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in Paris to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its World Heritage List. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to \\"maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage,\\" making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems. the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late. In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted \\"The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape.\\" In January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the IDF request to build the separation barrier through the village 'Israeli Supreme Court rules against separation wall in Battir,' Ma'an News Agency 4 January 2015. Archaeology Roman Inscription found near Battir mentioning the 5th and 11th Roman LegionsAn old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village. Archaeologist D. Ussishkin dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road. A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion, which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during Emperor Hadrian's reign.Clermont-Ganneau, 1899, pp. 463-470.

It is the third game in the handheld version of the Mega Man series. The game follows the title character Mega Man as he fights the evil Dr. Wily, whose latest attempt to conquer the world involves sucking energy from the Earth's core to power a new machine. Along with foes from his past, Mega Man must contend with the next robot in Wily's line of \\"Mega Man Killers\\", Punk. Like its two consecutive predecessors on the Game Boy, the game combines elements from two previously released Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles: Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4. In 2013, Mega Man III was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year. Plot The story of Mega Man III consists of the hero Mega Man battling the evil scientist Dr. Wily, who is using a converted oil platform in the middle of the ocean to draw energy from the Earth's core to power a new machine. After annihilating eight robots whom Wily had previously used, Mega Man makes his way to Wily's lab, where he encounters the mad doctor attempting to escape. A powerful robot designed specifically to destroy the hero, Punk, confronts Mega Man but is defeated. Mega Man chases Wily onto the oil platform (which emerges from the water as Wily's latest fortress) and halts his enemy's plans once again. Gameplay The game combines elements from the NES games Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4. Shown here is Snake Man's stage. Mega Man III shares the action and platform gameplay set forth the NES Mega Man games. The player is able to choose between 4 stages that are immediately available. Mega Man's primary method of attack is his \\"Mega Buster\\", which can fire an unlimited number of small shots or can be charged by holding the down the button and then releasing a larger and more powerful blast. Beating the Robot Master boss at the end of each stage allows the player to add its unique weapon to Mega Man's arsenal. The player can also gain access to Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a \\"Coil\\" mode to let the player jump higher or a \\"Jet\\" mode for flying large distances across the screen. Another companion robot, Flip Top Eddie, will appear in certain stages to randomly lend the player health, weapon power, extra lives, or storable Energy Tanks for completely refilling health. Mega Man III features four Robot Master adversaries from Mega Man 3 (Snake Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Gemini Man) and four from Mega Man 4 (Dive Man, Drill Man, Skull Man, and Dust Man). Development Series contributor Keiji Inafune stated Capcom outsourced the development of Mega Man III (known in Japan as Rockman World 3) and the rest of the Game Boy titles to the same company that worked on Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge due to a bad experience with the one that worked on Mega Man II. \\"I decided to look at World 3 as a fresh new start, and I remember digging into it with renewed zest,\\" Inafune claimed. \\"Punk, in particular, was a favorite of mine and I used my sway as the producer to have him included in Mega Man Battle Network.\\" Reception and legacy Mega Man III was given a positive review from the North American Electronic Gaming Monthly, which noted its use of familiar gameplay and a large amount of visual detail. In contrast, the United Kingdom's Nintendo Magazine System called it \\"a prime example of flogging a dead horse. Not really bad, but made unplayable by the sheer frustration level.\\" The editors of GameSpot consider Mega Man III a rare find because it was never re-released in budget form likes the two games before it. Mega Man III was made available on March 13, 2001 for the Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan alongside the other four Game Boy Mega Man games. All five games were to receive an enhanced remake compilation on the Game Boy Advance in 2004, but the project was ultimately cancelled. A redesign of Punk was featured in the spin-off game Mega Man Battle Network 3. A stage featuring the boss Punk was part of the downloadable content for Mega Man 10 in 2010. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man III is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console, which came out in October 9, 2013 in Japan, in North America on May 8, 2014,http://www.nintendo.com/eshop/mega-may Nintendo and in the PAL region on August 14, 2014.

Plot The storyline of Mega Man II involves the hero Mega Man battling his arch nemesis Dr. Wily as the latter once again attempts to take over the world. This time around the evil genius has stolen an experimental \\"Time Skimmer\\" from the world's Chronos Institute and used it to travel 37.426 years into the future. Meanwhile, Mega Man is sent to investigate an underground passageway containing enemy Robot Masters from his previous adventures. Mega Man destroys them again and makes his way to Wily's fortress, which contains four more Robot Masters from his past. Once they are destroyed, Mega Man advances and comes upon Quint, a future version of himself. Wily had captured Quint in the future, remodeled him, and brought him back to the present. After Mega Man beats him, Quint relinquishes his \\"Sakugarne\\" jackhammer weapon to the hero. Mega Man follows Wily to a space station and defeats him. Gameplay The game continues the Game Boy series trend of recycling elements from the two consecutive NES titles: Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3. Shown here is the boss fight with Crash Man. As with other games in the series, Mega Man II is a standard side-scrolling platformer that lets the player take control of the hero Mega Man as he traverses stages and defeats various enemies and bosses. The player is able to run, jump, and shoot as in the previous game, but is now able to slide along the ground as well. The outset of the game allows the player to choose among four stages to be completed in any order. Beating the Robot Master boss at the end of the stage allows the player access to its unique weapon for the remainder of the game. These weapons have limited ammunition that can be refilled by picking up items dropped by enemies. Spare energy tanks can be obtained and selected to completely refill the player's health. Defeating some Robot Masters will grant Mega Man access to three adaptors for his canine companion Rush to be used in different environments. The Rush Coil allows Mega Man a very high jump; the Rush Marine turns the dog into a submarine for easy underwater mobility; and the Rush Jet lets Mega Man cross large distances. Like Dr. Wily's Revenge, Mega Man II takes many elements from the NES Mega Man games. The first four stages and their bosses (Wood Man, Air Man, Clash Man, and Metal Man) come from Mega Man 2. After traveling to Wily's fortress, four new stages become available via a teleportation room. The bosses for these stages (Top Man, Hard Man, Magnet Man, and Needle Man) are taken from Mega Man 3. Development Capcom outsourced the development of Mega Man II to a different company than the one that had worked on Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge. Series artist Keiji Inafune admitted that the design quality of Mega Man II feeling different from the other games was the result of the developer having very little knowledge of the series. For the next game in the Game Boy line, they decided to forgo using the developer for Mega Man II again. Release Mega Man II has been re-released as part of the Nintendo Player's Choice line of budget titles in North America. The game was made available on the Japanese Nintendo Power cartridge service on March 13, 2001. Capcom announced a compilation release of the five Game Boy Mega Man games for a release in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance, but it was cancelled. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man II was planned to release on the 3DS Virtual Console, which released in Japan on September 25 2013, in North America on May 8 2014.http://www.nintendo.com/eshop/mega-may Nintendo and in the PAL region on August 7, 2014. Reception Mega Man II Gameboy received average reviews. Jeremy Parrish of 1UP.com opined Mega Man II as \\"Not Worth It!\\", summarizing it as \\"a random assortment of enemies and stages from Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 from NES, downsampled and downscaled for Game Boy\\". Adaptation=Archie Comics= The Mega Man Archie Comics series incorporated elements of the game, though a full adaptation was not produced before the series went on hiatus. Quint notably appeared twice in issue 20, displaying elements of his own character as well as that of Rockman Shadow, the primary antagonist of Rockman & Forte Mirai kara no Ch≈çsensha. He subsequently made appearances in issue 55, in which Dr. Light saw in vision his conflict with the present day Mega Man followed by Mega Man's transformation into Quint in the future.

It was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on a 1945 novel written by Josephine Leslie under the pseudonym of R.A. Dick. In 1945, 20th Century Fox bought the film rights to the novel, published only in the United Kingdom at that time. It was shot entirely in California. Plot In England in the early 1900s, young widow Lucy Muir moves to the seaside village of Whitecliff despite the disapproval of her mother-in-law Angelica Muir and domineering sister-in-law Eva Muir. She rents a place called Gull Cottage, though it has a reputation as being haunted by the spirit of a seaman who committed suicide there. On the first night after moving in with her young daughter, Anna, and her loyal maid, Martha, Lucy is visited by an apparition of the former owner, a roguish but harmless sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Gregg tells Lucy that his death four years ago was not a suicide but instead the result of accidentally kicking the valve on a gas-fired room heater in his sleep. Gregg explains that he had wanted to turn Gull Cottage into a home for retired seamen and does not appreciate her presence, having personally frightened away previous visitors. He didn't leave a will ‚Äì including his plans for the house ‚Äì because he hadn't anticipated dying so soon. However, due to Lucy's headstrong attitude as well as her appreciation of the house, Gregg reluctantly agrees to allow her to live in Gull Cottage and promises to make himself known only to her. It is not long before Angelica and Eva arrive with the news that Lucy's investment ‚Äî her only source of income ‚Äî has dried up, and they insist that Lucy move back to London with them. However, Gregg convinces Lucy to stay, using his ghostly abilities to drive her in-laws from the house. He suggests that Lucy publish a book, a dictation of his memories from his time at sea, for which she will take credit. During the course of writing the book they fall in love. Both realize it is a hopeless situation, and Gregg tells Lucy she should find a living man to marry. In London, Lucy becomes attracted to Miles Fairley, a suave author who writes children's stories under the pen name Uncle Neddy and arranges for an interview with his publisher. The Captain's lurid and sensational recollections, titled Blood and Swash, become a bestseller, providing Lucy with royalties which she uses to buy Gull Cottage. Fairley follows her back to Whitecliff and begins a whirlwind courtship. Captain Gregg, though initially disgusted by their relationship, decides to leave, as he considers himself an obstacle to Lucy's chance at happiness. While Lucy is asleep, Captain Gregg places in her mind the suggestion that she alone wrote the book and that his presence was merely a dream. He then fades away. Fairley sends a note cancelling a planned visit to Gull Cottage, saying he will be in London for a few days. Later, Lucy visits London to sign a contract, obtaining Fairley's London address from the office clerk and paying a surprise visit. Lucy discovers that Fairley is already married with two children, and his wife tells her that Fairley has romanced other women in the past. Heartbroken, Lucy returns to Whitecliff to spend the rest of her life as a recluse, with Martha looking after her. Anna, now grown, returns with a Royal Navy lieutenant she plans to marry. In the course of a conversation with her mother, Anna reveals that she too had seen Gregg's ghost, whom she regarded as a childhood friend, and knew about her mother's relationship with Uncle Neddy. Lucy reveals that fate has not been kind to Fairley; his wife and children have left him, and he has become fat, bald, and a heavy drinker. Many years later, now ailing and under a doctor's care, Lucy complains to Martha that her arm hurts and rejects the glass of hot milk Martha has brought for her. After Martha leaves the room, Lucy takes a sip, but the glass falls to the floor as she dies. Captain Gregg's ghost reappears and reaches out to Lucy, whose young spirit takes his hands and leaves her aged body. They gaze lovingly at each other, then walk arm in arm out of the house into an ethereal mist.

Sanders' casting came about when Richard Ney, the original actor playing the role, was fired for being inadequate in the part.Lee Server, Screenwriter: Words Become Pictures, 1987 p 108-109 Bernard Herrmann, the composer of the film's music, regarded it as his finest score. Reception The New York Times called The Ghost and Mrs. Muir \\"a pleasurable film, despite its failings,\\" singling out Edna Best for \\"by far the best performannce [sic]\\". In the writer's opinion, Harrison \\"has such an ingratiating personality that this compensates in large measure for the lack of characterization in his role,\\" but Tierney \\"is a pretty girl, but has no depth of feeling as an actress.\\" Variety, on the other hand, praised the actors and the film unreservedly: > ‚ÄúGene Tierney gives what undoubtedly is her best performance to date. It‚Äôs > warmly human... the out-of-this-world romance pulls audience sympathy with > an infectious tug that never slackens. In his role as the lusty, seafaring > shade, Rex Harrison commands the strongest attention...Philip Dunne‚Äôs script > lards the R. A.

Awards and honors Charles Lang received a 1947 Academy Award nomination for his black- and-white cinematography on the movie. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì #73 * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores ‚Äì Nominated * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Fantasy Film Adaptations to other media The Ghost and Mrs. Muir was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the December 1, 1947 broadcast of Lux Radio Theater with Charles Boyer and Madeleine Carroll and was adapted on the August 16, 1951 Screen Director's Playhouse with Boyer and Jane Wyatt. A 90-minute adaptation by Barry Campbell of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 December 1974 with Bryan Pringle as Captain Gregg, Gemma Jones as Lucy Muir, and Philip Bond as Miles.https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/57f31f8299b042319c3553009c06ed2d From 1968 to 1970, a TV series titled The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, starring Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare, aired on NBC and then ABC. It had the same premise and main characters as the book and film, but it was a situation comedy, downplaying the romantic fantasy elements and focusing on broad humor. The time and setting were changed, with the action taking place in a contemporary American coastal town (although the ghost was portrayed as being from the Victorian era). For the series, Mrs. Muir's first name was changed from Lucy to Carolyn, and the children's names were changed from Cyril and Anna (in the original novel) to Jonathan and Candace. In April 1994, Variety continued its reporting on Sean Connery's being slated to play the Captain in a version of the story for 20th Century Fox. The project was still ‚Äúin the pipeline‚Äù in 1997. On June 3, 2005, a musical based on the film and the book, written and directed by James J. Mellon, had its world premiere at the NoHo Arts Center in Los Angeles. Variety gave it a mixed review. DVD and Blu Ray releases The film was released on Blu-ray in 2013 by 20th Century Fox after being selected in Fox's Voice Your Choice promotion. It previously was released on DVD as part of the 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

This is a very rare result; only two ties have occurred in the 2,000 Tests played since 1877. The first was in 1960 and the second in 1986. On both occasions, the aggregate scores of both sides (teams) were equal at the conclusion of play and the side batting last had completed its final innings: 10 batsmen had been dismissed or, from the perspective of the side bowling, 10 wickets had been taken. In other words, after four completed innings, with each innings ending either by a declaration or 10 wickets having fallen, the runs for both teams were exactly the same. In cricket, a tie is distinct from a draw, a much more common result in Tests, which occurs when play concludes without victory by either team (except where a Test has been formally abandoned). Both tied Tests involved the Australian cricket team. Both ended in the last possible over of play on the last day with a ball to spare, meaning that within the space of several minutes all four normal Test match results were possible: a win for the batting side, a win for the fielding side, a draw or a tie. Bob Simpson is the only person to be involved in both tied tests ‚Äî as a player for Australia in the first, and as the Australian team coach in the second. First tied Test, 1960 The first tied Test was played between the West Indies and Australia.Scorecard from CricketArchive The match was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, known as \\"the Gabba\\", in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, between 9 and 14 December 1960.Article from The Hindu by Jack FingletonArticle from BBC SportLast over from Cricketfundas.com = West Indies 1st innings = After a disastrous start of 65‚Äì3, Garfield Sobers made a rapid 132 in 174 minutes. Alan Davidson took 5‚Äì135. West Indies were all out for 453 runs. = Australia 1st innings = Norm O'Neill made 181 in 401 minutes. Australia were all out for 505, a lead of 52. = West Indies 2nd innings = Alan Davidson took 6‚Äì87 and West Indies made 284, setting Australia a target of 233 runs to win. = Australia 2nd innings = Davidson and Australian captain Richie Benaud set an Australian 7th-wicket partnership record of 134 in matches against the West Indies.  Last over  Wes Hall was bowling, with the clock showing 5:56. Australia stood at 227‚Äì7, needing six runs to win from the 8-ball over (the standard for tests in Australia at the time) with three wickets in hand. * 1st ball: Wally Grout, facing, was hit on the thigh. Benaud called him through for a single to take strike. Five runs were needed to win from seven balls. * 2nd ball: Benaud attempted a hook shot but was caught behind by wicket-keeper Gerry Alexander. The score was 228‚Äì8. * 3rd ball: The new batsman, Ian Meckiff, cut to mid-off. No run. Still five runs to win from five balls. * 4th ball: The ball flew down leg-side without making contact with Meckiff's bat. Grout called him through for a bye. Alexander threw the ball to the bowler's end to try to run out Meckiff, but his throw missed and Meckiff made his ground. Four runs to win from four balls. * 5th ball: Grout fended a bouncer to square leg, where Rohan Kanhai was ready to take the catch. Hall also attempted to take the catch in his follow-through, resulting in a fielding mix-up which allowed Meckiff and Grout take a single and the catch was not taken. Three runs to win from three balls. * 6th ball: Meckiff swung desperately and sent the ball towards the mid-wicket boundary. The batsmen ran two runs as Conrad Hunte scooped the ball up just inside the fence. The batsmen attempted a third run for victory but Hunte's return was flat and true, straight into the gloves of Alexander, who whipped off the bails before Grout could get home. The teams were tied. Australia were on 232‚Äì9, requiring one run to win with one wicket in hand and two balls remaining. * 7th ball: The new batsman, Lindsay Kline, pushed the ball to square leg and set off for a single. Joe Solomon scooped up the ball and, with one stump to aim for from 12 metres out, threw the ball in and hit the stumps, running Meckiff out by a few inches. Australia were all out for 232 and the match ended in the first tie in 84 years of Test cricket. Second tied Test, 1986 The second tied test was the first Test of a three Test series, played between Australia and India, at the M. A.

One run required off two balls. * 5th ball: The ball hit Singh on his back leg and umpire Vikramraju called him out leg before wicket after a loud appeal. India were all out for 347, Matthews having taken 5‚Äì146 (10‚Äì249 in the match) and Ray Bright 5‚Äì94, and the match was the second tie in Test cricket. Dean Jones and Kapil Dev were joint Men of the Match. Draws with scores level In addition to the two tied Tests, there have been two Tests which ended when time expired with the scores level in the fourth innings, but with the batting side still having wickets in hand. These matches are considered to be draws, rather than ties. *The first such Test was in 1996, between Zimbabwe and England at Bulawayo, when England, chasing 205 to win, finished on 204‚Äì6. With three runs required for victory off the final ball, Nick Knight ran two but was run out attempting the third. * The second such Test was in 2011, between India and the West Indies at Mumbai, when India, chasing 243 to win, finished on 242‚Äì9. With two runs required off the final ball, Ravichandran Ashwin completed the first run and was run out attempting the second.

The hatched circles show the outline of the barrel to which the firebox was attached. A Round-topped firebox cross section shown for comparison. Note the angling of the stays. Pacific-type flat-topped inner firebox The Belpaire firebox is a type of firebox used on steam locomotives. It was invented by Alfred Belpaire of Belgium in 1864. Today it generally refers to the shape of the outer shell of the firebox which is approximately flat at the top and square in cross-section, indicated by the longitudinal ridges on the top sides. However, it is the similar square cross-section inner firebox which provides the main advantages of this design i.e. it has a greater surface area at the top of the firebox where the heat is greatest, improving heat transfer and steam production, compared with a round-top shape. The flat firebox top would make supporting it against pressure more difficult (e.g. by means of girders, or stays) compared to a round-top. However, the use of a similarly shaped square outer boiler shell allows simpler perpendicular stays to be used between the shells. The Belpaire outer firebox is, nevertheless, more complicated and expensive to manufacture than a round-top version. Due to the increased expense involved in manufacturing this boiler shell, just two major US railroads adopted the Belpaire firebox, the Pennsylvania and the Great Northern.William D. Middleton; Rick Morgan; Roberta L. Diehl. 2007. Encyclopedia of North American Railroads. Indiana University Press. p. 1009. . In Britain most locomotives employed the design after the 1920s, except notably those of the LNER. Description In steam boilers, the firebox is encased in a water jacket on five sides, (front, back, left, right and top) to ensure maximum heat transfer to the water. Stays are used to support the surfaces against the high pressure between the outside wall and the interior firebox wall, and partially to conduct heat into the boiler interior. In many boiler designs, the top of the boiler is cylindrical above the firebox, matching the contour of the rest of the boiler and naturally resisting boiler pressure more easily. In the Belpaire design, the outer upper boiler wall sheets are roughly parallel with the flat upper firebox sheets giving it a squarer shape. The advantage was a greater surface area for evaporation, and less susceptibility to priming (foaming), involving water getting into the cylinders, compared with the narrowing upper space of a classic cylindrical boiler. This allowed G.J. Churchward, the chief mechanical engineer of the Great Western Railway, to dispense with a steam dome to collect steam. Churchward also improved the Belpaire design, maximising the flow of water in a given size of boiler by tapering the firebox and boiler barrel outwards to the area of highest steam production at the front of the firebox. The shape of the Belpaire firebox also allows easier placement of the boiler stays, because they are at right angles to the sheets. Despite these claimed advantages, other locomotive boilers such as the LNER pacifics had flat-topped inner fireboxes with round-topped outer shells and with as good a thermal performance as the Belpaire type, without suffering major problems with staying between shells. In the USA, the Belpaire firebox was introduced in about 1882 or 83 by R. P. C. Sanderson, who at the time was working for the Shenandoah Valley Railroad (essentially a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, since they shared the same financial backing from E. W. Clark & Co.). Sanderson was an Englishman (later naturalized as an American citizen) who had attained his engineering degree from Cassel in Germany in 1875. Having obtained knowledge of a special form of locomotive boiler (the Belpaire), Sanderson wrote to an old acquaintance from his college days who was working at the Henschel locomotive factory at Cassel. He sent Sanderson a tracing of Henschel's latest Belpaire boiler. When shown the design, Charles Blackwell, Superintendent of Motive Power for the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, was very pleased with the design and placed an order with the Baldwin and Grant locomotive works for two passenger engines, afterwards numbered 94 and 95, and five freight engines, afterwards numbered, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 60. That marked the beginning of the use of the Belpaire-type locomotive boiler in the United States.HAPS AND MISHAPS: The Autobiography of R. P. C. Sanderson, 1940, Philadelphia The Pennsylvania Railroad used Belpaire fireboxes on nearly all of its steam locomotives. The distinctive square shape of the boiler cladding at the firebox end of locomotives practically became a \\"Pennsy\\" trademark, as only the Great Northern used Belpaire fireboxes in significant numbers in the USA.

It is owned by Entercom and serves the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. KQKS's current slogan is #1 For Today's Hottest Music, referring to a musical mix of R&B;, hip hop and Rhythmic Pop hits. Its studios and offices are located in the Denver Tech Center district, and the transmitter is on Green Mountain in Lakewood. KQKS broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 subchannel airs comedy programming, feeding translator station 103.1 K276FK in Denver, known as \\"Comedy 103.1.\\" KQKS History=KLMO-FM Longmont= KQKS's origins began in December 1986, when Western Cities Broadcasting purchased KLMO-FM in Longmont. KLMO-FM had signed on in September 1964, the FM counterpart of AM 1060 KLMO (now KRCN).Broadcasting Yearbook 1967 page B-27 Western Cities would move the transmitter site closer to Denver, increase power from 28,000 watts to 100,000 watts, and antenna height was would be increased from 88 feet to 980 feet. The call sign was switched to KQKS, and the format flipped to Adult Contemporary. At the time, the station broadcast at 104.3 FM and was known as \\"104.3 Kiss FM.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-01-09.pdf =Top 40 KS104= In mid-1987, the branding was shortened to \\"KS104\\". On August 1, 1987, amidst heavy competition against three other FM adult contemporary stations in Denver, and with only one Top 40 station in the market, KQKS segued to a Mainstream Top 40 format, again as \\"KS104.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-08-07.pdf By 1989, KQKS evolved into a Dance-leaning Rhythmic Top 40 outlet. But by 1993, the station shifted back to mainstream contemporary hits when it was left as the market's sole surviving Top 40 radio station. The air staff at the time included Mark Speers and Laurie Michaels in mornings, PJ Cruise in middays, Michael Hayes in afternoons, Sweet G in evenings, Ed Atkins in late evenings, JJ Cruze on overnights, and Brody Scott on swing. By 1995, KS104 was competing heavily against KWMX and KALC, particularly for the young female audience. As a direct result, KQKS returned to a rhythmic contemporary direction that year. But by 1996, KQKS was struck by a major blow when the entire on-air staff defected across the street to the newly minted Rhythmic Contemporary rival KJMN, and began attacking \\"KS104\\" on- air and on the streets. =Move to FM 107.5= In November 1996, Western Cities sold \\"KS104\\" to Jefferson-Pilot Communications (now known as Lincoln National Corporation) for $15 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-74 Jefferson-Pilot had no disc jockeys on the air for two months. Jefferson- Pilot was also the owner of 107.5 KHHT at the time. On January 8, 1997, Jefferson-Pilot moved KQKS to 107.5 and relaunched it as \\"KS1075\\", replacing KHHT. KQKS's former home at 104.3 FM switched to Classic Country on January 18.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-01-17.pdfhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-01-24.pdf (104.3 is now sports radio KKFN-FM.) The move boosted KQKS's ratings, resulting in KJMN throwing in the towel on March 30, 1997. Since then, KQKS has faced several competitors, but none of them has overtaken KQKS, which maintains a top 5 status in the Denver Nielsen ratings. In 2009, Clear Channel Communications flipped KPTT (which had once competed against KQKS as Top 40/CHR KFMD from 2000 to 2005) to Rhythmic Top 40, resulting in KQKS adding more rap to its playlist. While Rap and Hip-hop accounts for over 50% of KS1075's playlist, the station, like most of the other Rhythmic outlets in the United States, has added some Rhythmic Pop/Dance tracks due to changing tastes among its listeners. As of 2020, KQKS continues to compete against KPTT, which has shifted back to mainstream Top 40/CHR, as well as increased competition from rimshot KFCO, which shifted to a current- focused Rhythmic presentation after nearly 4 years of having a classic hip-hop format, only to return to Top 40/CHR in May 2020, leaving KQKS as the market's only Rhythmic Top 40. =Ownership Change= In late 2005, Lincoln Financial Group acquired Jefferson-Pilot, which in turn resulted in Lincoln Financial becoming KQKS' parent company. The firm decided to keep Jefferson-Pilot's broadcasting properties in its portfolio despite offers by other broadcasting groups to buy the stations. On April 3, 2006, KQKS and the other stations began replacing the ownership on-air liners \\"A Jefferson-Pilot Station\\" with \\"A Lincoln Financial Station.\\" In June 2007, Lincoln Financial announced that would put its television and radio stations up for sale. KQKS and its sister stations in Denver were among the properties being shopped around by Lincoln Financial, until the company suspended those plans in 2008. On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced it would purchase Lincoln Financial Group's entire 15-station lineup in a $106.5 million deal, and would operate the outlets under a local marketing agreement (LMA). On December 22, 2014, Entercom announced that it would retain KQKS and its current format.\\"Entercom Acquires Lincoln Financial Media\\" from Radio Insight (December 8, 2014) The FCC approved the deal on June 26, 2015.\\"FCC OKs Lincoln Financial-Entercom Deal\\" from All Access (June 26, 2015) 107.5 History=Country KLAK-FM= On July 9, 1966, KLAK-FM signed on, originally broadcasting at 107.7.Broadcasting Yearbook 1967 page B-27 It was owned by Lakewood Broadcasting Service and it simulcast the Country format of its sister station AM 1600. In 1970, it relocated to 107.5 and became KJAE, switching its format to Top 40. But this first attempt at contemporary hits would be short lived. The station returned to Country in 1973 and restored the KLAK-FM call sign. In 1978, it changed call letters to KPPL (\\"K-People\\"), airing a Beautiful Music/MOR format, followed by a brief stint with a Modern Rock format in 1983. =Top 40/CHR Y108= In February 1983, KPPL and AM sister station KLAK were acquired by Malrite Communications, and would become a sister station to CHR powerhouse WHTZ (Z100) in New York, which went on the air the same year. In July 1984, 107.5 switched to Top 40/CHR and took the call sign KRXY, adopting the moniker \\"Y108 FM\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1984/RR-1984-08-03.pdf It was the top rated CHR station in Denver during the mid and late 1980s, competing against KOAQ (Q103) until that station transitioned to an adult contemporary format in 1986, and against KPKE until that station flipped in 1987. KRXY also simulcast at night on 1600 AM as \\"KRXY-AM\\" during this time. Program directors were Robin Mitchell, Scott Fischer (interim), John Driscoll, Mark Bolke, and Dom Testa who took over PD duties in 1991. The music directors were Geina Horton, Todd Cavanah, and Dom Testa. The Y108 morning show was hosted by, in sequence, Chuck Buell, John Driscoll, and Dave Otto. Afternoon personalities included Beau Matthews, Scott \\"Scruff\\" Thrower, and Dom Testa. Evenings featured Bwana Johnny and Michael \\"Moondoggie\\" Moon. Don MacLeod was heard on late nights and weekends. In October 1987, Malrite Communications sold KRXY to Capitol Cities/ABC Radio for a reported $10.7 million.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-10-16.pdf =KWMX/KHHT= KRXY was overtaken in the ratings by KQKS (then at 104.3) in 1991; by this time, KRXY began to lean toward Adult Top 40, and eventually dropped the \\"Y-108 FM\\" moniker, becoming \\"Mix 107.5\\" with a Hot AC format in June 1991.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-06-15.pdf After Jefferson-Pilot bought the station from ABC in January 1993, its call letters were changed to KWMX on January 20.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-05.pdf In the mid-1990s, KWMX would compete against KOSI and KALC.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1992-2.pdfhttps://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1994-2.pdf In response, KWMX adjusted its playlist to a Modern Pop/Rock direction that KALC was also embracing at the time. In early 1996, the moniker changed slightly to \\"107-5 The Mix.\\" The move proved unsuccessful for KWMX.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1996-2.pdf In July 1996, KWMX's morning show was let go. At midnight on August 2, the station began stunting with audio from movies as \\"America's Radio Movie Channel.\\" At 5 p.m. on the 2nd, KWMX officially flipped back to Top 40, and changed its moniker to \\"K-Hits 107.5.\\" On August 30, 1996, the call letters switched to KHHT to match the \\"K-Hits 107.5\\" moniker.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-08-09.pdf;\\"Changing formats mean battle on rock 'n' roll front\\", The Denver Post, August 6, 1996.

The song, produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, was a commercial failure upon its original release in Europe in 1991. But by late 1992, it began receiving airplay on KQKS after one of the staffers heard a remix done by Hot Tracks, breathing new life into it. The record climbed up the charts, becoming a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, Top 40 Mainstream and Rhythmic Contemporary charts in 1993. Boy Krazy mentions KQKS in their thank you credits on the single which can be found on their first (and only) 1993 self-titled album.

The physical examination typically occurs after a thorough medical history is taken, that is, after the physician asks the patient the course of their symptoms. The abdominal examination is conventionally split into four different stages: first, inspection of the patient and the visible characteristics of their abdomen. Auscultation (listening) of the abdomen with a stethoscope. Palpation of the patient's abdomen. Finally, percussion (tapping) of the patient's abdomen and abdominal organs. Depending on the need to test for specific diseases such as ascites, special tests may be performed as a part of the physical examination. An abdominal examination may be performed because the physician suspects a disease of the organs inside the abdominal cavity (including the liver, spleen, large or small intestines), or simply as a part of a complete physical examination for other conditions. In a complete physical examination, the abdominal exam classically follows the respiratory examination and cardiovascular examination. The information gathered from the physical examination of the abdomen, along with the information from the history, are used by the physician to generate a differential diagnosis and ultimately a treatment plan for the patient. Purpose The purpose of the abdominal exam is to get more information that could indicate what is causing the patient's symptoms. The physician gains information by inspecting, auscultating, palpating, and percussing the abdomen. Positioning and environment A suggested position is for the patient to be supine (on their back), with their arms to their sides. The patient should be placed in an environment with good lighting, and should be draped with towels or sheets to preserve privacy and warmth. The patient's hips and knees should be flexed (in a bent position) so that their abdominal muscles remain relaxed during the examination. Asking the patient to indicate areas that may be tender or painful is recommended to avoid exacerbating the pain during inspection and to increase the patient's comfort. Although physicians have had concern that giving patients pain medications during acute abdominal pain may hinder diagnosis and treatment, separate systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Rational Clinical Examination refute this. Inspection Although it may not seem very important, the doctor is actually gaining a lot of information when looking at the abdomen during an exam and can pick up important indications that something may be going on below the surface. First, the doctor looks at the surface, outline, and movements of the abdomen, checking to see if there is anything odd or out of the ordinary. Looking at the skin, the doctor is looking for anything abnormal like scars, stretch marks, lesions, dilated veins, or rashes. The doctor then determines the shape of your abdomen, looking for any bumps, abdominal distension, or depressions. The doctor will also check your belly button for abnormalities like a hernia. Finally, the doctor will look at the movement of the abdomen checking specifically for waves or odd flexing. Auscultation Auscultation refers to the use of a stethoscope by the examiner to listen to sounds from the abdomen. Unlike other physical exams, auscultation is performed prior to percussion or palpation, as both of these could alter the regularity of bowel sounds. Some controversy exists as to the length of time required to confirm or exclude bowel sounds, with suggested durations up to seven minutes. Bowel obstruction may present with grumbling bowel sounds or high-pitched noises. Healthy persons can have no bowel sounds for several minutes McGee, S, Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis, 3rd Edition. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier- Saunders; 2012 and intestinal contractions can be silent. Hyperactive bowel sounds may be caused by partial or complete bowel obstruction as the intestines initially try to clear the obstruction. Absence of sounds may be caused by peritonitis, paralytic ileus, late-stage bowel obstruction, intestinal ischemia or other causes.Jarvis, C.(2008). Physical Examination and Health Assessment. 5th edn. Saunders Elsevier, St Louis Some authors suggest that listening at a single location is enough as sounds can be transmitted throughout the abdomen.Reuben, A. (2016). Examination of the abdomen. Clinical Liver Disease, 7(6), 143‚Äì150. doi:10.1002/cld.556 A prospective study published in 2014 where 41 physicians listened to the bowel sounds of 177 volunteers (19 of which had bowel obstructions and 15 with an ileus) found that \\"Auscultation of bowel sounds is not a useful clinical practice when differentiating patients with normal versus pathologic bowel sounds. The listener frequently arrives at an incorrect diagnosis. Agreement between raters was also low (54%).\\".Felder, S., Margel, D., Murrell, Z., & Fleshner, P. (2014). Usefulness of Bowel Sound Auscultation: A Prospective Evaluation. Journal of Surgical Education, 71(5), 768‚Äì773. doi:10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.02.003 This article suggests focusing on other indicators (flatus, pain, nausea) instead. There is no research evidence that reliably corroborates the assumed association between bowel sounds and gastro-intestinal motility status.Massey RL. Return of bowel sounds indicating an end of postoperative ileus: is it time to cease this long-standing nursing tradition? Medsurg Nurs . 2012;21(3):146‚Äì150 The examiner also typically listens to the two renal arteries for abnormal blood flow sounds (bruits) by listening in each upper quadrant, adjacent to and above the umbilicus. Bruits heard in the epigastrium that are confined to systole are considered normal.MD, Lynn B. Bates' Guide to Physical Examination and History-Taking, 11th Edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 11/2012. Palpation Examination of the abdomen of a child. The examiner should first talk to the patient and explain what this part of the examination will involve. He or she will typically palpate all nine areas of the patient's abdomen, and being mindful of areas of discomfort, begin by palpating areas of no pain. This is typically performed twice, first with light pressure and then with deeper pressure to better exam the abdominal organs. On light palpation, the examiner tests for any palpable mass, rigidity, or pain on the surface. On deep palpation, the examiner is testing for any organomegaly (enlarged organs.) Typically, the clinician is looking for enlargement of the liver and spleen or abnormal masses in the intestines. Sometimes the physician looks for the kidney and uterus as well. Reactions that may indicate pathology include: * Guarding: muscle contraction as pressure is applied. * Rigidity: indicating peritoneal inflammation. * Rebound: pain on release. *Referred pain: pain produced away from the area being palpated. Percussion Percussion can be performed in all four quadrants of the abdomen and may reveal a painful response by the patient. During the abdominal examination, percussion may allow the estimation of location and quantity of gas, hard or soft masses, and sizes of certain organs, such as the liver and the spleen. Abnormal findings may include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and urinary retention. Organomegaly of the liver and the spleen can be appreciated by percussing in a particular manner: *Hepatomegaly by percussing from the right iliac region to the right hypochondrium *Splenomegaly by percussing from the right iliac region to the right hypochondrium and the left iliac to the left hypochondrium Examination of the spleen may reveal Castell's sign or alternatively Traube's space. Dull sounds on the abdomen could suggest pregnancy, an ovarian tumor, a distended bladder, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Dullness on either side of the abdomen could suggest ascites. Some other areas of the abdomen may sound dull suggesting that there may be some fluid or feces. The dullness of the liver can be appreciated by percussing at the edge of the lower chest right above the costal margins. The resonant sounds of gastric air bubbles can be appreciated at the left side. In rare cases, when organs are reversed as is the case in situs inversus, resonant (hollow) sounds would be expected on the right side and liver dullness on the left.

Category:Diagnostic gastroenterology Category:Physical examination ","title":"Abdominal examination"},{"id":"2297133","text":"In medicine, Murphy's sign is a maneuver during a physical examination as part of the abdominal examination. It is useful for differentiating pain in the right upper quadrant. Typically, it is positive in cholecystitis, but negative in choledocholithiasis, pyelonephritis, and ascending cholangitis. During physical examination Classically, Murphy's sign is tested for during an abdominal examination in supine position; it is performed by asking the patient to breathe out and then gently placing the hand below the costal margin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line (the approximate location of the gallbladder). The patient is then instructed to breathe in. Normally, during inspiration, the abdominal contents are pushed downward as the diaphragm moves down (and lungs expand). If the patient stops breathing in (as the gallbladder is tender and, in moving downward, comes in contact with the examiner's fingers) and winces with a \\"catch\\" in breath, the test is considered positive. In order for the test to be considered positive, the same maneuver must not elicit pain when performed on the left side. Predictive value Murphy's sign has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value, although the specificity is not high. However, in the elderly the sensitivity is markedly lower; a negative Murphy's sign in an elderly person is not useful for ruling out cholecystitis if other tests and the clinical history suggest the diagnosis. History The sign is named after American physician John Benjamin Murphy (1857‚Äì1916), a Chicago surgeon from the 1880s to the early 1900s, who first described the hypersensitivity to deep palpation in the subcostal area when a patient with gallbladder disease takes a deep breath.

In 1967 she was president of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS), which was dedicated to ending oppressive minority rule and achieving equality for all South Africans. According to Marshall, \\"There was no access to justice in South Africa...There were a few courageous barristers who agreed to represent people charged with political crimes, but, by and large, if you were a black South African, you had no justice. The death penalty was imposed in vastly disproportionate numbers. Many of the offenses were applicable to black South Africans only.\\".lsc.gov In June 1966, as a NUSAS vice president, she welcomed U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy to South Africa, in place of union's president Ian Robertson, who had been banned from political appearances. Marshall emigrated to the United States to escape political persecution. In Johannesburg she attended Kingsmead College, and in Delaware she graduated from the Tatnall School. She earned a master's degree in education from Harvard in 1969, and a J.D. degree from Yale in 1976. She acquired United States citizenship in 1978. In 1984, she married then-New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, to whom she remained married until his death in 2013. Legal career From 1976 to 1989, she was an associate and a partner in private practice at the Boston law firm of Csaplar & Bok. From 1989 to 1992, she was a partner in the Boston law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart. Also from 1991 to 1992, she was president of the Boston Bar Association, the oldest bar association in the United States. From 1992‚Äì1996, she was general counsel to Harvard University. Marshall was appointed to be an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1996 by Republican Governor William F. Weld. She was named as chief justice in September 1999 by Republican Governor Paul Cellucci, to begin her term on October 14, 1999. She is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court, the oldest appellate court in the Western Hemisphere, and the first to serve as chief justice in its more than 300-year history. In the course of her term, she wrote more than 200 opinions. Marshall wrote the ground-breaking decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that declared that the Massachusetts constitution does not permit the state to deny citizens the right to same-sex marriage. On July 21, 2010, Marshall announced her decision to retire from the court, effective at the end of October. Marshall said her decision was prompted by a desire to spend more time with her husband Anthony Lewis, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease. After stepping down from the bench, she rejoined Choate, Hall & Stewart. Marshall served as the senior fellow of the Yale Corporation until 2016, the governing body of Yale University. She is the first woman to hold the position, and previously served a term as a Corporation fellow from 2004 to 2010.

Founded by Filemon \\"Momoy\\" Ca√±ete of the Doce Pares Club, SME served as vehicle for his own personal expression of the art and methodology of the club of which he was a co-founder and instructor. The name San Miguel (or Saint Michael) is taken from Michael (archangel), the slayer of Satan, and is one of the major strikes used in Eskrima (From right shoulder to left hip). The system San Miguel Eskrima is blade-based martial art system wherein various weapons are used as a primary training tools to teach universally transferable skills. There are two schools of thought on the birth of the San Miguel Eskrima style: The first, sees the San Miguel Eskrima part of an older style called Eskrima of God and Founded by the Ortega Family and more recently by Father Miguel Ortega, Father Jose Ortega and Father Nicolas Ortega in 1930 in Talaga (Argao). \\\\- Father Miguel Ortega, was President of the Church of Talaga City, Co-Founder of the Eskrima style of God and Founder of the style of San Miguel Eskrima called SM Dubli X, style that preferred Long Distance and Medium Distance using passing and rushing shots. Among the few students of Father Miguel Ortega we find Filemon Momoy Canete, who later gives his name to his personal interpretation of San Miguel Eskrima Dubli X, \\"San Miguel Eskrima\\" in Cebu City. \\\\- Father Nicolas Ortega was responsible for the training of the Filipino rebels during the Japanese invasion, and was awarded a National recognition still present today in front of the church of Talaga with a statue that represents it. \\\\- Father Jose Ortega, co-founder of the Eskima of God, taught the style of the Church to the Seminarists of Talaga. The Foundation of the Eskrima of God is linked to a lineage that took place within the Ecclesiastical Order, from Priest to Priest over time and the style began in the late 1800s. In the first school of thought the San Miguel Eskrima founded by the GM Momoy Canete would have only been a small technical part of the style San Miguel Eskrima Dubli X (which in turn was part of the older style called Eskrima of God) or The San Miguel Eskrima X System, to which Momoy gave the name in appreciation and respect towards his Original Master Father Miguel Ortega and in which passing shots were preferred, and double passing strokes, short strokes using the technique of Arco de abaniko and totsada, without an emphasis specific to only one type of weapon, but single stick, double stick, knife, double knife, espada y daga (sword and dagger) (taught to Momoy not by Father Miguel Ortega but by Gm Jesuis Qui to Cebu City), bankaw, saguidas. The steps of the San Miguel Eskrima X System were cross legs and Linambay. While in the second school of thought, in San Miguel Eskrima special emphasis is placed on training with the espada y daga (sword and dagger) that Momoy has learned from Jesuis Qui. The system encompasses single and double stick, dagger, long blade, bullwhip, staff as well as non- weapon, empty hand areas such as striking, elbows, takedowns, chokes, knees and kicks. Like all eskrima systems, San Miguel Eskrima uses the rattan stick as a primary teaching tool in place of other bladed weapons. San Miguel Eskrima is characterized by constant movement, efficiency and simplicity. Proper and precise body mechanics are emphasized, as do proper striking involving speed and power. Although the system trains with both low stances and stand up stances more common in today's Doce Pares as influenced by Momoy's brother Cacoy, the former (low) stances are preferred by SME practitioners for its power and stability. However, both low and high stances are employed when the situation arises. The system encompasses close quarter (corto) fighting with weapons and empty hands, long range (largo mano) and throws/grappling (dumog). San Miguel Eskrima training is skill based, as opposed to technique based. Constant drilling, forms and \\"repitacions\\" are combined with one-on-one touch hands guided sparring with the instructor. It is for this skill based approach that SME needs to be taught in a more intimate setting between instructor and student or a smaller group where touching hands with an instructor is essential. It is through this type of interaction that sensitivity is heightened and the instructor \\"guides\\" the student. For certain aspects of San Miguel Eskrima such as drills and forms, these aspects of San Miguel Eskrima make it difficult to teach in a large classroom and seminar based environment. A common source of confusion is that San Miguel Eskrima is separate from Doce Pares; not realizing that San Miguel was a particular expression and methodology of Momoy within the Doce Pares Club and system. Many of the current Doce Pares drills have their roots and terminology in Momoy. Momoy was the Club's founder and its longest instructor until his death in 1995. Filemon \\"Momoy\\" Ca√±ete - founder Born Filemon Ca√±ete, on November 22,1904, in the central Philippine island of Cebu, Momoy was the chief instructor of the Doce Pares Club for 55 years until his death in 1995. Together with Lorenzo Saavedra, Teodoro Saavedra, Rostico Cobarrubias and others they formed the Labangon Fencing Club in 1920. In 1932, Momoy joined both Saavedras and his other brothers to form the Doce Pares Club. After that period, Momoy begins to teach outside the Doce Pares Club and more precisely in the San Carlos Seminary, where he teaches a group of seminarians including Jonathan Lao, Nicolas Sellon, Alberto Dacayana Sr and Tarcisio Buno. Momoy was part of Cebu's famed Ca√±ete clan of eskrimadors (martial artists that practiced eskrima). His brothers included Eulogio (Euling, b. 1919), Tirso, Ciriaco (Cacoy), Rufino and Silvestre. Organizations With the passing of its founder, Momoy's son Andres \\"Kano\\" Ca√±ete has become one of the current official recognized bearers of the system. The remaining top students, former well-known fighters of Momoy and now Grandmasters, Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Culanag, Urbano \\"Banoy\\" Borja, Federico Mendoza Jnr, Edring Casio, Genaro \\"Naro\\" Mendoza serve as the Advisory Council of the system and Dacayana Alberto Sr. He will be the first Student of Momoy to open the Club of San Miguel Eskrima in Mambalin Street along with Idring Casio and Prudencio Ondo Caburnay(Lapunti Arnis). The council oversees all functions of the San Miguel Eskrima organization including curriculum and organizational direction.

It is published by Seven Seas Entertainment. The first volume of Amazing Agent Luna was one of Seven Seas Entertainment's four initial releases. In July 2005 Amazing Agent Luna became the first of Seven Seas Entertainment's titles to have its second volume released. It is Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling OEL manga. There are 11 volumes out with volume 11 released on October 27, 2015. Seven Seas Entertainment has also released 4 omnibus volumes. The first containing volumes 1-3, the second containing volumes 4-5, and the third containing volumes 6-7, with a fourth containing volumes 8-9. The fifth, containing the final 2 volumes, was released on December 15, 2015. It has also created a spin-off series, Amazing Agent Jennifer, which focuses on Jennifer Kajiwara, Luna's biological mother. This series contains 2 volumes. Plot The story follows Luna, a genetically bred super-spy created by the US government. At age 15, Luna is given her toughest assignment yet: after being raised in isolation and only trained as a spy, she must now pose as a normal high school girl. Since she never knew real parents or friends, things quickly become very confusing for her. She makes friends with Oliver, a skater with a crush on her; and Francesca, a nice girl who used to be friends with Luna's rival. But she also has to deal with the emotions and events many teenagers face. To make matters much harder on Luna, the boy she develops a crush on, Jonah, is the son of her main enemy, Count Von Brucken. Characters ;Luna: The main protagonist who does not know a lot about the real world, and often gets confused about things she does not understand. Even though she's been raised in solitude for most her life, she's a fast learner and quickly picks up on things. She is an amazing spy and fighter, but rather than being a mission-focused agent, Luna is gentle and quite sensitive and yearns for the comfort of family and friends. Her name as a student is Luna Collins. When enrolled into Nobel High, her honest and kind personality quickly earned her a friendship with Francesca and Oliver, and becomes closer to Jonah, but she soon begins to juggle between her secret duties as an agent and being honest with her friends. Luna has feelings for Jonah but likes Oliver as just-a-friend. In the 4th book, she kissed Jonah with him promising that he'd keep her secrets. ;Count Heinrich Von Brucken: The main antagonist in the whole series. He's more of a comic villain. Luna breaks into his embassy in Paris where she discovers files on students in Noble High for \\"Project Scion\\". What project Scion truly is remains a mystery until the very end. It is a plan to take the sons and daughters (scions) of the important people sending them there, clone and genetically enhance them, replace the clones' minds with the minds of Bruckenstien loyalists who have been studying them for years, then place them back in Noble High as \\"students\\". ;Francesca Aldana: Francesca is the daughter of Spanish diplomats. She is described to have red hair. She once hung out with Elizabeth Westbrook and her gang until Luna appeared to the school. From the first day Francesca met Luna, she became fast friends with her and Oliver Riggs. Elizabeth gave Francesca the choice of either hanging with her or hang with Luna and Oliver. Francesca eventually chooses Luna and Oliver and Elizabeth has picked on her ever since. Francesca, in the 4th book, is shown to have some feelings toward Oliver but because Oliver's crush on Luna blinds him so, she disregards it and falls in love with Timothy, a boy at the school. She often expresses how gross she thinks the genetic engineering and clones are, so Luna telling her about her secrets will be hard. :Soon, Luna is forced to recruit Timothy into her work, first to save Jia Lin, and then more often afterwards. As Timothy spends more time secretly helping Jia and Luna, in addition to both keeping secrets from her, Francesca doesn't take the exclusion from Timothy and her friends quite well, and her friendship with Luna becomes strained. Unlike Luna's and Oliver's more serious family problems and their issues with Luna's spy work, because Francesca is mostly left out of Luna's secret life, most of the difficulties she endures are of her social life at school. She briefly returns to Elizabeth's side, but eventually reconciles with Luna. ;Oliver Riggs: The son of Charles Riggs, a security guard at the U.N. His mother, Bowie O'Shea, was a musician who left after Oliver was born. Oliver was the outcast at Nobel High, being a 'loser skater'. When Luna came to their school, Oliver develops a crush on her. He knows that Luna likes Jonah very much, but he does not accept it. He does not notice that Francesca has or had a crush on him. He later finds out Luna's identity when they are being attacked by a clone of Elizabeth Westbrook. :Later, it is discovered that Oliver's father is working with Count Von Brucken, and he gets arrested. Oliver then lives with his mother, who is pretty easygoing despite their distant relationship, but does try to take care of him. But when Oliver discovers that Luna's agency is forcing Brucken to work for them, he gets angry at Luna for letting Brucken live in their house, while Oliver's father is still in jail. His relationship with Luna becomes strained, but he nonetheless keeps her secret. :Oliver soon becomes good friends with Heather, one of Elizabeth's lackeys. Heather warms up to Oliver's kindness, and becomes sick of Elizabeth's bossiness. Oliver hangs with Heather while he is still upset with Luna, but still doesn't confirm that Heather is actually his girlfriend. He eventually reconciles with Luna, and he, Luna, and Francesca reaffirm their friendship with each other. ;Jonah Von Brucken: The son of Luna's main enemy, Count Von Brucken. He goes to the same school as Luna. He is mysterious, brooding, and handsome. He later ends up falling in love with Luna. He was expelled in the third book for beating up a boy named Erich Kohler. In the 4th book, he was able to return to Nobel High. Also in the 4th book, he tells Luna he knows everything about her, ever since their first meeting in Paris. During the end of their mission with Charles trying to break into the UN files the first time, he promises Luna that he'd protect her secret and kisses her. He later nearly betrays her when he learns that her Control Agent was the one who killed his mother, but saves Luna, Francesca, and Oliver in the end. ;Jennifer \\"Control\\" Kajiwara: Luna's by-the-book control agent, Control poses as Luna's mother, but hates working with Dr. Andy. Contrary to Dr. Andy's priorities, Control is usually more concerned with the integrity of the mission rather than Luna's welfare. Ironically, Control, who has raised Luna ever since she was \\"born\\" in a secret lab, is the closest thing Luna has to a mother. In the 4th book, it is shown that she's developed feelings for Andrew \\"Andy\\" Collins. She is later revealed to be Luna's real mother and the reason she is so set on Luna not failing is so that government will not terminate her. At the end of the third book, Control takes over the position of science teacher at Nobel High. In the seventh book, it is revealed that Control and Dr. Andy both have feelings for each other and they both share a kiss which Luna walks in on. ;Andrew \\"Andy\\" Collins: Usually called \\"Dr. Andy.\\" He poses as Luna's father, and at first dislikes working with Control. Unlike Control, he is very concerned about Luna's emotional health, and often gives Luna social advice that Control is unable to provide. In the 4th book, he quits over Control's pushing him to make Luna Okay with killing, but he decides to stay for Luna's sake and due to Control threatening his safety once he leaves. His feelings for Control have been confirmed in the 6th book. ;Timothy Hyatt: A very smart boy attending Noble High. After Dr. Warren is busted for her cloning experiments he was dragged along by his friend Martin who started using the lab to clone dates for the upcoming spring dance, the first of which rampaged and died shortly after being made from poor cloning. He offers to help Francesca with science and develops a crush on her. Despite Martin's insisting he will not clone her for the dance. Later the boys are hired by Von Brucken but Timothy turns on them and frees Elizabeth. :He is dating Francesca. Luna is often forced to ask for his help in her secret work, first to help Jia Lin, and then in future missions when his intelligence becomes vital. Because his and Luna's secret work divides his time with Francesca, and because they have to keep it a secret from her, Francesca becomes upset with them for their dishonesty. ;Elizabeth Westbrook: The daughter of a British Scientist and Diplomat. She is the most popular girl at Nobel High, and a stereotypical spoiled princess and stuck-up brat. She was once friends with Francesca until Luna came to Nobel High and Francesca became friends with Luna and Oliver. Elizabeth gave Francesca a choice between her or Luna. Francesca decided to be with Luna and Oliver, so Elizabeth started to pick on her. She went out with Jonah Von Brucken as a way to tick off Luna, but she broke the relationship after the first semester. She is later kidnapped by Count Von Brucken under his belief that she is the secret agent he's been looking for. They make a genetically enhanced clone of her and were going to kill her but Timothy turned sides and rescued her. :Elizabeth is usually seen with at least two lackeys who follow her, whom she expects to be completely loyal and obedient to her and dump other friends like Luna. She is very vain and bossy, and her insufferable personality gradually costs her some of her friends. Francesca leaves her early in the series to become friends with Luna and Oliver, Jia Lin also becomes friends with Luna and Timothy, and Heather becomes friends with Oliver and becomes fed up Elizabeth's attitude. ;Principle Ohlinger: The good hearted principal of Luna's high school. She was kidnapped and had her intelligence switched with that of an owl until Luna and Ohlinger's pet owl, Aristotle, saved her and was able to switch Ohlinger's mind back into her body. ;Mark Dreyfus: The ex-Navy Seal gym teacher at Noble High. He is one of the first to learn of Luna's secret. Some of the students find him big and scary, but after learning Luna's secret, he becomes very helpful to her whenever needed. He later starts a romantic relationship with Oliver's mother and proposes to her, and she accepts, which Oliver is not so happy about. ;Bowie O'Shea: Oliver's mom who returns to take care of him after his father gets arrested. She did have a crush on Dr. Collins, but whatever happened between them is over according to volume six. She's a musician who was on tour when she arrived. She later becomes good friends with Mark Dreyfus, the gym teacher of the school. He eventually proposes to her, which she accepts. ;Jia Lin: A beautiful and reserved Chinese exchange student. She was initially friends with Elizabeth and her group, but Elizabeth tried to recruit her into her group because she mistook Jia's silent demeanor as being stuck up just like Elizabeth. When she gets damaged during a fight between Luna, Jonah and Anders, she discovers that she is actually a robot, built by her supposed father. Distraught to learn that she isn't human, she begins to question and deny the value of her own life, despite some of her friends still being there for her even after learning what she is. Luna recruits Timothy to repair her, and then recruits him again when Jia gets kidnapped and her heart is turned into a fusion bomb. Luna and Timothy manage to save her, and she moves away afterwards, grateful to her friends. :Jia is soon forced out of hiding, due to the fusion technology within her being highly desired by various corrupt parties, including Luna's and Jennifer's superiors, and it falls to Luna, Jonah, and Anders to protect her. ;Anders Haugen: A student at Nobel High, who becomes Luna's love interest after she and Jonah become more distant. Anders is actually an agent of Knightfall, and secret organization that works to sabotage secret government operations. Though on opposite sides with Luna, he believes that he is right to fight Luna's agency, which is seemingly becoming more corrupt and immoral. He pursues Luna's affections, and Luna eventually reciprocates, albeit reluctantly. :Luna eventually breaks up with him, being unable to commit to his organization. Despite that, he still insists that he is her ally, which may turn out true when Luna's agency pursues Jia Lin and turns against Luna and her family and friends.

He settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended seminary, and was ordained Priest of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis on April 10, 1852. =Priestly career= He was a missionary to slaves in Potosi and Old Mines, Washington County, Missouri in 1852 and 1853. He was priest at Saint John Apostle and Evangelist church and founded Saint Michael's parish, both in the City of St. Louis, Missouri. In 1857, he started a series of missions in outstate Missouri, ministering mainly to transient Irish railroad workers and Catholic settlers. He ministered primarily in Chillicothe, Macon City, Brookfield, Mexico, and Cameron, Missouri. In 1859 he started a settlement of Irish in southern Missouri, which was wiped out during the American Civil War; this deserted area is now called the Irish Wilderness. The northern Missouri missions suffered greatly during the war, not due to military battles, but by attacks of bushwackers and guerillas. The public school system collapsed during the war, and Father Hogan set up a school for two years. After the war, Father Hogan was arrested for failing to take the Ironclad oath, a requirement of the Radical Missouri constitution of 1865; this provision was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. =Catholic History= Hogan was appointed as the head of the newly erected Diocese of Saint Joseph on March 3, 1868, and was consecrated Bishop by Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick of Saint Louis on September 13, 1868.

Biography Ludwig D√∂derlein was born at Jena. His father was Johann Christoph D√∂derlein, professor of theology at Jena. After receiving his preliminary education at Windsheim and Schulpforta (Pforta), he studied at Munich, Heidelberg, Erlangen and Berlin. He devoted his chief attention to philology under the instruction of such men as F. Thiersch, G. F. Creuzer, J. H. Voss, F. A. Wolf, August Boeckh and P. K. Buttmann. In 1815, soon after completing his studies at Berlin, he accepted the appointment of ordinary professor of philology in the academy of Bern. In 1819 he was transferred to Erlangen, where he became second professor of philology in the university and rector of the gymnasium. In 1827 he became first professor of philology and rhetoric and director of the philological seminary. Works D√∂derlein's most elaborate work as a philologist was marred by over-subtlety, and lacked method and clearness. He is best known by his Lateinische Synonymen und Etymologien (1826-1838), and his Homerisches Glossarium (1850-1858). To the same class belong his Lateinische Wortbildung (1838), Handbuch der lateinischen Synonymik (1839), and the Handbuch der lateinischen Etymologie (1841), besides various works of a more elementary kind intended for the use of schools and gymnasia. Most of the works named have been translated into English. To critical philology D√∂derlein contributed valuable editions of Tacitus (Opera, 1847; Germania, with a German translation) and Horace (Epistolae, with a German translation, 1856-1858; Satirae, 1860).

In commercial airliners  Diagram of a chemical oxygen generator system Chemical Oxygen Generator, Cut-away View Commercial aircraft provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen. The oxidizer core is sodium chlorate (NaClO3), which is mixed with less than 5 percent barium peroxide (BaO2) and less than 1 percent potassium perchlorate (KClO4). The explosives in the percussion cap are a lead styphnate and tetrazene explosive mixture. The chemical reaction is exothermic and the exterior temperature of the canister will reach .

The key reaction is: :2 NaClO3 ‚Üí 2 NaCl + 3 O2 Potassium and lithium chlorate, and sodium, potassium and lithium perchlorates can also be used in oxygen candles. An explosion caused by one of these candles killed two Royal Navy sailors on , a nuclear-powered submarine, under the Arctic on 21 March 2007. The candle had become contaminated with hydraulic oil, which caused the mixture to explode rather than burn. In the Vika oxygen generator used on some spacecraft, lithium perchlorate is the source of oxygen. At 400 ¬∞C, it releases 60% of its weight as oxygen: :LiClO4 ‚Üí LiCl + 2 O2 Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generators Advances in technology have provided industrial oxygen generator systems for use where air is available and a higher concentration of oxygen is desired. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen. Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the oxygen generator, producing an oxygen-enriched gas. Nitrogen separation membrane equipment is also used. Uses Chemical oxygen generators are used in aircraft, breathing apparatus for firefighters and mine rescue crews, submarines, and everywhere a compact emergency oxygen generator with long shelf life is needed. They usually contain a device for absorption of carbon dioxide, sometimes a filter filled with lithium hydroxide; a kilogram of LiOH absorbs about half a kilogram of CO2. *Self-contained oxygen generators (SCOGs) are used in submarines. *Self- contained self-rescue devices (SCSRs) are used to facilitate escape from mines. *On the International Space Station, chemical oxygen generators are used as a backup supply. Each canister can produce enough oxygen for one crewmember for one day.

An MPhil typically includes a taught portion and a significant research portion, during which a thesis project is conducted under supervision. An MPhil may be awarded to postgraduate students after completing taught coursework and one to two years of original research, which may also serve as a provisional enrollment for a PhD programme. Australia In Australia, the Master of Philosophy is a research degree which mirrors a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in breadth of research and structure. Candidates are assessed on the basis of a thesis. A standard full-time degree often takes two years to complete. Belgium and Netherlands In Belgium and the Netherlands, the MPhil is a special research degree, and is only awarded by selected departments of a university (mostly in the fields of arts, social sciences, archaeology, philosophy and theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students aiming for an academic career. After finishing these programmes, students normally pursue a PhD programme. The Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science decided in 2009 not to recognize the MPhil degree. Accordingly, Dutch universities stopped awarding this degree and now award the legally-recognized Master of Arts or Master of Science degrees instead.De MPhil graad wordt niet meer verleend, Leiden University. Canada The MPhil is offered at some Canadian universities as a two-year degree involving coursework, examinations, and practice at academic writing. At some institutions, successful completion leads to a guaranteed place on a PhD course with \\"advanced standing\\", reducing the length of the PhD by a year. India Indian universities offer MPhil degrees as the most advanced master's degree in the fields of arts, science and humanities. The duration is typically two years long and includes both a taught portion and an extensive research portion. Several universities offer enrollment in their integrated MPhil‚ÄìPhD program and MPhil degree holders are usually exempted from some of the doctoral coursework requirement. In July 2020, the Government of India announced that as part of its new National Education Policy MPhils would be discontinued in India. https://www.livemint.com/education/news/mphil-to-be-discontinued-and-other- key-points-in-national-education-policy-11596022845294.html Finland In Finland, the regular master's degree filosofian maisteri translates to \\"Master of Philosophy\\". As in English, the term \\"philosophy\\" does not imply a specialization in theoretical philosophy. These degrees are regular master's degrees, not special \\"higher\\" degrees (cf. Licentiate and Doctor of Philosophy). In the past, filosofian maisteri signified that the degree was earned through actual studying, in contrast to honorary master's degrees that were granted upon application to bachelor's degree graduates. Malaysia In Malaysia, the MPhil degree is commonly offered in a number of older and more- established universities in Malaysia, including the University of Malaya, Multimedia University (MMU), Wawasan Open University, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC), Monash University Sunway Campus (MUSC) and Curtin Malaysia Campus. In most cases, the MPhil is largely a research degree, with only a minor taught component. On a case-by-case basis, candidates must pass a viva voce examination before the degree is awarded. For UNMC and MUSC, the Faculty of Engineering offers a standalone MPhil degree which will lead to the PhD. The MPhil is normally regarded as a more prestigious master's degree than typical taught master's degrees such as the MA, MSc or MEng. Specifically for the University of Malaya, if the desired field of research does not belong to any of the specialized faculties, it is normally categorized under the MPhil supervised by the Postgraduate Institute. In November 2012, the Malaysian Qualifications Agency issued programme standards for postgraduate studies in which MPhil is attributed to Master programme by research and mixed mode (coursework and research). Norway In Norway, the degree of MPhil was a master's degree (180 ECTS credits) at a level equivalent to an MA or MSc However, unlike a standard MA or MSc, which have a thesis worth 60 ECTS, the MPhil has a research workload of up to 180 ECTS. Upon completion, the MPhil graduate usually qualifies for acceptance to a PhD program. Nevertheless, the MPhil is most often taken as a standalone qualification. The MPhil degree was considered to be equivalent to US and UK PhD degrees and from the early 1900s the PhD established itself as the usual translation of Danish and Norwegian master's degrees into English. This must be seen in the context of the fact that the PhD originally designated research education in the US and eventually equivalent degrees in the UK which had a similar scope and fulfilled a similar function as the master's degree in Denmark and Norway, as the final degree taken at the beginning of a research career, while the doctorates in Denmark and Norway were often taken by middle-aged and well-established academics. In Denmark and Norway, PhD in the 20th century was therefore not necessarily or necessarily regarded as identical to a \\"doctorate\\" as understood in Denmark and Norway. Also in the UK, PhD was explicitly introduced as a \\"lower doctorate\\" according to US model calculated on younger researchers than those who took the traditional doctorates, and the PhD degree was awarded without defense and with less ceremonial Pakistan In Pakistan, the MPhil is one of the most advanced master's degrees offered by public and private universities in several different fields of study. This is usually a two-year full-time program which includes teaching and research that leads to the PhD. The degree of MPhil also serves as a requirement to gain admission into a Doctoral program in Pakistan. Spain In Spain, the MPhil degree is equivalent to the Diploma de Estudios Avanzados, or DEA. In order to obtain it, the student has to complete a full year of doctoral courses and training in research methods, as well as doing original research towards a thesis. United Kingdom In most UK universities, the MPhil is a research degree. The completion of an MPhil typically requires two years of full-time (or five years or more of part-time study) and the submission of coursework and a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate (typically 25,000 to 50,000 words). It is common for students admitted into a PhD program at a UK university to be initially registered for the degree of MPhil, and then to transfer (or upgrade) to the PhD upon successful completion of the first (or sometimes the second) year of study: this will often involve the submission of a report or dissertation by the student, and possibly an oral examination or presentation. Conversely, a PhD candidate may transfer to an MPhil programme or be awarded the degree of MPhil if they do not meet the requirements for the award of a PhD. Usage can be different at the ancient universities. The MPhil at Oxford and Cambridge can be either a taught degree or a research degree, and may take one or two years, depending on the course. Cambridge University offers one- and two-year-long MPhil degree programs across all of its departments and faculties. This takes the place of the MA at other universities, as the Oxbridge MA is awarded to BA graduates after a certain period without any further study. At Oxford University, the MPhil is usually a two-year master's degree, although some programs are one-year. The MPhil requires a lengthy thesis and more examinations than a one-year master's degree (such as the MSc or MSt). The ancient Scottish universities, who for historical reasons award the Scottish MA upon completion of four-year first degree programs in arts and humanities subjects, differ in their use of MPhil or MLitt for postgraduate research degrees, but are slowly standardizing to the MPhil as a research degree and the MLitt as a taught degree. United States Although most American universities do not award the MPhil, a few award it under certain circumstances. At some of those institutions (including Yale University, Columbia University, New York University, George Washington University, The New School, and the CUNY Graduate Center), the degree is awarded to PhD candidates when they complete their required coursework and qualifying examinations prior to the completion and defense of a doctoral dissertation. This formalizes the more colloquial \\"All But Dissertation\\" status; as such, defense of a dissertation proposal is sometimes required for conferral. Other colleges and universities, such as the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania, offer a standalone MPhil as an advanced graduate degree in various fields.

It is located in Ali Sadr Kabudarahang County about 100 kilometers north of Hamadan, western Iran (more accurately at 48¬∞18'E 35¬∞18'N). Because of the cave's proximity to large cities such as Hamadan, it is a highly recommended destination for tourists from all corners of the world. Tours of the cave are available by pedalos. The Ali-Sadr cave was rediscovered by a shepherd from Ali-Sadr village in which the cave is located. Faces of discovers, engraved on a stone board near cave entrance Description Ali-Sadr Cave Ali-Sadr is the world's largest water cave, where you sit in a boat and watch the view. This cave is located at 48¬∞18'E 35¬∞18'N, in the southern part of Ali Sadr village. The cave is entered at the side of a hill called Sari Ghiyeh which also includes two other caves called Sarab and Soubashi, each 7 and 11 kilometers from Ali-Sadr Cave. Apparently, the water in Ali-Sadr cave stems from a spring in Sarab. In the summer of 2001, a German/British expedition surveyed the cave, finding to be 11 kilometers long. The main chamber of the cave is 100 meters by 50 meters and 40 meters high. The cave walls can extend up to 40 meters high, and it contains several large, deep lakes. The cave has a river flowing through it and most travel through the cave system is done by boat. More than 11 kilometers of the cave's water canals have been discovered so far. Some routes are 10 to 11 kilometers long and all lead to \\"The Island\\", a centrally located large atrium. Early occupation Excavations and archeological studies of the cave have led to the discovery of ancient artworks, jugs and pitchers dating back to 12,000 years ago. Animals, hunting scenes and bows and arrows are depicted on the walls and passages of the exit section. These images suggest primitive man used the cave as their abode. The cave was known during the reign of Darius I (521-485 BC) which can be verified by an old inscription at the entrance of the tunnel. However, the knowledge of the existence of the cave was lost and it was only rediscovered in 1963 by Iranian mountaineers.

It chronicles the early days of the Beatles in Hamburg, Germany. The film focuses primarily on the relationship between Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff) and John Lennon (Ian Hart), and also with Sutcliffe's German girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl Lee). It has subsequently been made into a stage production. Plot The film follows the Beatles through their pre-fame Hamburg days when Stuart Sutcliffe, the band's bassist, meets German photographer Astrid Kirchherr. Cast In addition, brief portrayals of other historical characters in these early days of the Beatles include Paul Duckworth as Ringo Starr, Paul Humpoletz as Bruno Koschmider, Wolf Kahler as Bert Kaempfert and James Doherty as Tony Sheridan. Hart had already played Lennon in the 1991 film The Hours and Times. Bakewell later reprised his role as McCartney in the 2000 television film The Linda McCartney Story. Williams reprised his role as Best in the 2000 television film In His Life: The John Lennon Story. Production=Writing= The original script was written by Iain Softley based on a series of 1988 interviews. After failing to secure funding, screenwriter Stephen Ward was brought in to completely rewrite the script in 1993. Ward interviewed Astrid Kirchherr and others who were close to the Beatles during their time in Hamburg. The project was green-lit that year. =Soundtrack= Due to the film's focus on the early days of the band, the soundtrack includes no songs written by members of the Beatles but various songs the group performed in Hamburg, written and recorded by other artists. In this respect, rather than re-create the sounds of the period, iconoclastic, rebellious musicians were recruited (as a producer noted, the Beatles' pre- recording stage act was \\"the punk of its day\\") to better convey the way the music was appreciated by audiences of the time. All musicians were members of contemporary American rock bands: * Dave Pirner (Soul Asylum): vocals (Paul McCartney) * Greg Dulli (The Afghan Whigs): vocals (John Lennon) * Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth): guitar * Don Fleming (Gumball): guitar * Mike Mills (R.E.M.): bass guitar * Dave Grohl (Nirvana): drums * Henry Rollins (Black Flag): vocals (Stuart Sutcliffe) The film's distributor happened to be PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which was then under common ownership with Polydor Records, the label that owned the rights to the Beatles' music from the Hamburg days. Release The film premiered on 14 April 1994. It was then distributed on a limited release. A DVD version was released by Universal Studios in 2005. Reception=Critics= As of July 2019, Backbeat holds a rating of 69% based on 39 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the review aggregator site. Rolling Stone liked how the film captured the early 60s period through its visual style and use of music. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars; although he thought the \\"dialogue has real wit\\" the film was let down because \\"it's never able to convince us there's a story there\\". =The Beatles and others= Paul McCartney said of the film: > One of my annoyances about the film Backbeat is that they've actually taken > my rock 'n' rollness off me. They give John the song \\"Long Tall Sally\\" to > sing and he never sang it in his life. But now it's set in cement. It's like > the Buddy Holly and Glenn Miller stories. The Buddy Holly Story does not > even mention Norman Petty, and The Glenn Miller Story is a sugarcoated > version of his life. Now Backbeat has done the same thing to the story of > the Beatles. I was quite taken, however, with Stephen Dorff's astonishing > performance as Stu. Astrid Kirchherr praised the accuracy and detail of her relationship with Sutcliffe and the Beatles. The film received further positive responses from Julian Lennon, Pete Best, and Sutcliffe's sister, Pauline, who said, \\"I still think the director did a fabulous job. It's a good movie. If you like movies, it's a great movie.\\" Stage adaptions The film's original writer and director, Iain Softley, turned the screenplay of Backbeat into a theatrical production. It premiered at Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre on 9 February 2010 featuring a live band. In 2011 another stage version opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.

It was the final game of the 1966 NFL season. It determined the champion of the National Football League (NFL), which met the champion of the American Football League (AFL) in Super Bowl I, then formally referred to as the first AFL‚ÄìNFL World Championship Game. The Western Conference champion Green Bay Packers (12‚Äì2), defending league champions, were hosted by the Dallas Cowboys (10‚Äì3‚Äì1), the Eastern Conference champions. The home field for the NFL Championship alternated between the two conferences; even-numbered years were hosted by the Eastern and odd-numbered by the Western. Starting with the 1975 season, playoff sites were determined by regular season record, rather than a rotational basis. The New Year's college bowl game at the Cotton Bowl for the 1966 season included the SMU Mustangs of Dallas. It was played the day before, New Year's Eve, which required a quick turnaround to transform the natural grass field. The two games were filled to the 75,504 capacity, but both local teams came up short. Background It was the first NFL title game played after the AFL-NFL Merger was announced in June 1966. The game was played on January 1, 1967, the second consecutive year that the NFL season ended in January, rather than December. This was seventh season for the Dallas Cowboys and their first winning record since entering the league in 1960. They were champions of the NFL's Eastern Conference with a 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 record. The Packers won the Western Conference with a 12‚Äì2 record, their eighth consecutive winning season under head coach Vince Lombardi. Tickets for the game sold for ten dollars, and kickoff was just after 3 p.m. CST, televised by CBS, following the AFL Championship from Buffalo on NBC. The final score was Green Bay 34, Dallas 27. Two weeks later, Green Bay went on to easily defeat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I in Los Angeles. Game summary The seasoned Packers, defending champions of the season, were favored by a touchdown over the talented, but young Cowboys team, who had no players with championship experience and only one player over 30, linebacker Chuck Howley. The game was expected to be a shootout, and as wary as the Packers were of Cowboys wide-out Bob Hayes, the fastest man in football at the time, Lombardi made the decision before the game not to put double-coverage on the Olympic champion sprinter. It proved to be a good gamble, as Herb Adderley and Bob Jeter held Hayes to only one reception for one yard. Lombardi also installed a special offense for the game, knowing that the Cowboys had spent time preparing to stop plays like the Packers sweep. Green Bay scored on their opening drive, with Elijah Pitts breaking free for a 32-yard run on the opening play - a misdirection play that was part of Lombardi's special game plan. Later Pitts took a circle route pass over the middle from Bart Starr at the Cowboy 5 and broke a tackle by Warren Livingston to cap a 17-yard touchdown play. Then Cowboys defensive back Mel Renfro fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Packer rookie Jim Grabowski returned it 18 yards to give Green Bay a 14-0 lead before Dallas' first play. But the Cowboys stormed back with a 13-play drive to score on Dan Reeves' 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then after forcing a punt, they drove 59 yards to tie the game at 14 with a 23-yard touchdown burst by fullback Don Perkins. Starr broke the tie on the third play of the second quarter with a 51-yard bomb to Carroll Dale over the head of CB Cornell Green. Dallas responded with a 68-yard drive to the Packers 4-yard line, featuring a 40-yard completion from Don Meredith to a wide open Reeves, but could go no further and settled for an 11-yard Danny Villanueva field goal, cutting their deficit to 21-17. Green Bay had a chance to retake a 7-point lead before halftime, but Don Chandler's 30-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Cowboys tackle Ralph Neely. Early in the third quarter, Dallas defensive back Warren Livingston recovered a fumble from Pitts on the Cowboys 21-yard line. Meredith then led the team on a 13-play drive to bring the score to within one point, 21-20, on Villanueva's 32-yard field goal. But on Green Bay's next drive, Starr completed a 40-yard pass to Dale, who beat Green to the outside. From the Dallas 16 Starr hit Boyd Dowler cutting across the field for his third TD pass of the game, giving the Pack a 28-20 lead going into the fourth quarter. Dallas safety Mike Gaechter upended Dowler after the end took several steps in the end zone, causing Dowler to leave the game (Dowler was hampered much of the season by a calcium deposit on his shoulder). Bart Starr had to guide an upset Jim Taylor to the Green Bay sideline when the fiery Green Bay fullback started looking for Gaechter. Late in the final period, Hayes fielded a punt on his own 1-yard line and was tackled inside the 5. Don Meredith hit a cold streak and missed several passes, and a Dallas punt gave Green Bay good field position on the Dallas 48. George Andrie sacked Starr on the first play, but he then picked up a key first down with a 24-yard pass to tight end Marv Fleming. Later faced with 3rd and 12, he completed a 16-yard pass to fullback Jim Taylor for a first down. Starr was again sacked on the drive, this time for an 11-yard loss by Willie Townes. But on third and nineteen, the Packers picked up a Cowboy blitz and Starr threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Max McGee (who replaced the injured Dowler). McGee had told Starr he could beat cornerback Warren Livingston to the outside (\\"Zig out\\" pattern). With just 5:20 left, the game appeared to be slipping out of reach for the Cowboys. However, defensive tackle Bob Lilly kept his team in the game by blocking Chandler's extra point attempt, keeping the deficit at 2 scores, 34-20, rather than 3. Dallas started their comeback attempt on the ensuing drive. Faced with 3rd down and 20, Meredith threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to tight end Frank Clarke, making the score 34-27. Desperately trying to run out the clock with their ensuing possession, Green Bay started out with an 18-yard reception by Fleming on the Packers 46. But on the next play, Starr was sacked for an 8-yard loss by linebacker Dave Edwards. Townes broke up a screen pass on the next play, and then Taylor was stuffed for a loss. Now faced with 4th down, a heavy rush from the Dallas defense caused Chandler's punt to go just 17 yards, giving the Cowboys the ball on the Green Bay 47-yard line with 2:12 remaining. A 21-yard catch by Clarke and a 4-yard run by Perkins advanced the ball to the Green Bay 22-yard line. Then a pass interference penalty on safety Tom Brown gave the Cowboys a first down at the Packer 2-yard line. Halfback Dan Reeves gained a yard on first down. A crucial mistake on a false start by Jim Boeke penalized the Cowboys back to the Green Bay 6 (nullifying a play where a wide-open Pettis Norman had dropped a pass in the end zone), and Reeves then dropped a pass in the flat on second down. Reeves had been scratched in the eye on his previous run but did not come out of the game in favor of rookie Walt Garrison despite clouded vision, another mental error. Meredith found tight end Pettis Norman on third down to bring Dallas back to the two-yard line, the end making the catch on his knees. On fourth down, the Cowboys attempted a rollout pass. No one on the Cowboys noticed that end Bob Hayes was in the goal line offense instead of Frank Clarke, who was typically used for better blocking. Packer linebacker Dave Robinson recognized the play from films, brushed Hayes aside, stormed into the Cowboy backfield and enveloped Meredith. Somehow Meredith got a wobbly sidearm toss away, but Tom Brown intercepted the pass in the end zone as the intended receiver, Hayes, was surrounded by Packers defenders.http://fs64sports.blogspot.ae/2011/01/1967-packers-hold-off-cowboys- to-win.html Vince Lombardi later congratulated Robinson, but in the next breath criticized him for being out of his assigned position. Starr completed 19 of 28 passes for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns, with no interceptions, though he was sacked five times. His quarterback rating for the game was a stellar 143.5. Dale caught 5 passes for 128 yards and a score. Pitts led the Packers in rushing with 66 yards and caught a TD pass. Meredith finished the game 15/31 for 238 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, while also rushing for 22 yards. Perkins rushed for 108 yards and a score, while Reeves rushed for 47 yards, caught 4 passes for 77 yards, and scored a touchdown. \\"I don't know, we haven't played Alabama yet.\\" ‚Äì Vince Lombardi after being asked what it felt like to be the greatest football team in the world just after winning the 1966 NFL Championship Game. Coincidentally, Bear Bryant's Crimson Tide wrapped up an 11-0 season the next day by routing Nebraska 34-7 in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. With the win, the Packers earned their tenth NFL championship; it was their second in a row and fourth in six seasons under Lombardi, in his eighth year as Green Bay's head coach. This was the Packers' only post-season win in the Dallas area prior to the 2010 season, when they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, played in the Cowboys' current home, Cowboys Stadium. =Scoring summary= Sunday, January 1, 1967 Kickoff: 3:05 p.m. CST *First quarter **GB ‚Äì Elijah Pitts 17 pass from Bart Starr (Don Chandler kick), 7‚Äì0 GB **GB ‚Äì Jim Grabowski 18 fumble return (Chandler kick), 14‚Äì0 GB **DAL ‚Äì Dan Reeves 3 run (Danny Villanueva kick), 14‚Äì7 GB **DAL ‚Äì Don Perkins 23 run (Villanueva kick), 14‚Äì14 TIE *Second quarter **GB ‚Äì Carroll Dale 51 pass from Starr (Chandler kick), 21‚Äì14 GB **DAL ‚Äì FG Villanueva 11, 21‚Äì17 GB *Third quarter **DAL ‚Äì FG Villanueva 32, 21‚Äì20 GB **GB ‚Äì Boyd Dowler 16 pass from Starr (Chandler kick), 28‚Äì20 GB *Fourth quarter **GB ‚Äì Max McGee 28 pass from Starr (kick blocked), 34‚Äì20 GB **DAL ‚Äì Franklin Clarke 68 pass from Meredith (Villanueva kick), 34‚Äì27 GB Officials *Referee: (7) Tommy Bell *Umpire: (15) Ralph Morcroft *Head Linesman: (30) George Murphy *Line Judge: (24) Bruce Alford *Back Judge: (25) Tom Kelleher *Field Judge: (34) Fritz Graf The NFL had six game officials in ; the line judge was added a season earlier in and the side judge arrived twelve years later in .

Subsequently, the invasions of the Gauls and the defensive activities of the Roman Republic made large changes in the map. The Umbri were Italic people of ancient Italy.Pliny, Natural History Vol 3, chap. 19. A region called Umbria still exists and is now occupied by Italian speakers. It is somewhat smaller than the ancient Umbria. Most ancient Umbrian cities were settled in the 9th-4th centuries BC on easily defensible hilltops. Umbria was bordered by the Tiber and Nar rivers and included the Apennine slopes on the Adriatic. The ancient Umbrian language is a branch of a group called Oscan-Umbrian, which is related to the Latino-Faliscan languages. Etymology They are also called Ombrii in some Roman sources. Some Roman writers thought the Umbri to be of Celtic origin; wrote that they descended from an ancient Gaulish tribe. Plutarch wrote that the name might be a different way of writing the name of the Celto-Germanic tribe , which loosely means \\"King of the .\\" He also suggested that the , another Gaulish tribe, might be connected; their Celtic name Isombres could possibly mean \\"Lower Umbrians,\\" or inhabitants of the country below Umbria.Prichard, Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind: In Two Volumes, Volume 2, p. 60 Similarly Roman historian Cato the Elder, in his masterpiece Origines, defines the Gauls \\"the progenitors of the Umbri\\". The Ambrones are mentioned, with the Lombards and the Suebi, among the Germanic tribes of Northern Europe in the poem Widsith.Widsith, lines 31-33 Furthermore, according to Roman authors, the Ambrones originated somewhere in Germany or Scandinavia.Plutarch, The Lives, The Life of Marius. Pliny the Elder wrote concerning the folk-etymology of the name: Religion During the 6th‚Äì4th centuries BC, Umbrian communities constructed rural sanctuaries in which they sacrificed to the gods. Bronze votives shaped as animals or deities were also offered. Umbrian deities include Feronia, Valentia, Minerva Matusia and Clitumnus. The Iguvine Tablets were discovered in 1444 at Gubbio, Italy. Composed during the 2nd or 3rd centuries BC, they describe religious rituals involving animal sacrifice.Poultney, 1959 Political structure Two men held the supreme magistracy of uhtur and were responsible for supervising rituals. Other civic offices included the marone, which had a lower status than uhtur, and a religious position named kvestur. The Umbrian social structure was divided into distinct groups probably based upon military rank. During the reign of Augustus, four Umbrian aristocrats became senators. Emperor Nerva‚Äôs family was from Umbria.Bradley, 2000 According to Guy Jolyon Bradley, \\" The religious sites of the region have been thought to reveal a society dominated by agricultural and pastoral concerns, to which town life came late in comparison to Etruria.\\" Roman influence Throughout the 9th-4th centuries BC, imported goods from Greece and Etruria were common, as well as the production of local pottery. The Romans first made contact with Umbria in 310 BC and settled Latin colonies there in 299 BC, 268 BC and 241 BC. They had completed their conquest of Umbria by approximately 260 BC. Incorporation into the Roman state occurred during the 3rd century BC when some Umbri were given full citizenship or citizenship without the right to vote. Also during the 3rd century BC about 40,000 Romans settled in the region. The Via Flaminia linking areas of Umbria was complete by 220 BC. Cities in Umbria also contributed troops to Rome for its many wars. Umbrians fought under Scipio Africanus in 205 BC during the Second Punic War. The Praetorian Guard recruited from Etruria and Umbria. The Umbri played a minor role in the Social War and as a result were granted citizenship in 90 BC. Roman veterans were settled in Umbria during the reign of Augustus.Bradley, 2000 Archaeological sites Map of Umbria and Picenum showing the location of the Ager Gallicus. The Umbrians descend from the culture of Terni, protohistoric facies of southern Umbria. The towns of Chianciano and Clusium (Umbrian: Camars) near modern Arezzo contain traces of Umbrian habitation dating to the 7th or 8th centuries BC. Terni (in Latin: Interamna Nahars) was the first important Umbrian center. Its population was called with the name of Umbri Naharti. They were the largest, organized and belligerent tribe of the Umbrians and populated compactly across the basin of Nera River. This people are quoted for 7 times in the Iguvine Tablets. This is confirmed not only by the Iguvine Tablets, Latin historians and by the important and privileged role played by this city in Roman times, but also by the discovery, at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, of one of the mixed burial necropolis (Urnfield culture and burial fields) larger of Europe, about 3000 tombs (Necropoli delle Acciaierie di Terni). Assisi, called Asisium by the Romans, was an ancient Umbrian site on a spur of Mount Subasio. Myth relates that the city was founded by Dardanus in 847 BC. Perugia and Orvieto are not considered of Umbrian but Etruscan origin. According to the geographical distribution of the Umbrian territory, they are located on the left side of the Tiber River, which is part of the ancient Etruria. Umbri were on the opposite side of the river. According to the map of Regio Umbria and Ager Galliucus by Emperor Augustus , the major Umbrian city-state were: Terni, Todi, Amelia and Spoleto (the current part of southern Umbria). While north Umbrian cities such as Gubbio or Citt√† di Castello will be affected by the influence of Etruscan culture (a try are the Iguvine Tablets), they will develop a form of writing that is mix of Umbrian and Etruscan language, while the southern Umbrians (the purest and conservative in terms of tradition, language and culture) will not have.

His father ran Bonded Messenger Service, a delivery company founded by his grandfather in 1955. Perlstein grew up in the Bayside and Fox Point neighborhoods of suburban Milwaukee, taking cross country trips with his parents and siblings to national landmarks like Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park. In high school, upon earning his driver's license, Perlstein would head to Renaissance Books in downtown Milwaukee, and spend hours in its basement among stacks of old magazines from the 1960s.

Early career  After graduate study in American studies at the University of Michigan, Perlstein moved to New York in 1994, settling in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. While in New York, Perlstein interned at Lingua Franca, a magazine about academic and intellectual life, where he would become an associate editor. Perlstein also began writing book reviews, for publications like The Nation and Slate. It was Perlstein's 1996 Lingua Franca essay \\"Who Owns the Sixties?\\" that won him public notice, by exposing the emerging chasm between older and younger historians. The essay also aroused the attention of a literary agent and soon after earned him a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

It is the causal agent of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE; previously known as Australian encephalitis or Australian X disease). In humans, it can cause permanent neurological disease or death. MVEV is related to Kunjin virus, which has a similar ecology, but a lower morbidity rate. Although the arbovirus is endemic to Northern Australia, it has occasionally spread to the southern states during times of heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon season via seasonal flooding of the Murray- Darling River system. These outbreaks can be \\"...decades apart, with no or very few cases identified in between\\". Vector MVEV is a mosquito-borne virus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito-bird cycle. Water birds from the order Ciconiiformes, including herons and cormorants, provide the natural reservoir for MVEV. The major mosquito vector is Culex annulirostris. Human infection occurs only through bites from infected mosquitoes; the virus cannot be transmitted from person to person. History The first epidemics of MVE occurred in 1917 and 1918 in Southeastern Australia following years of high rainfall. The virus was isolated from human samples in 1951 during an epidemic in the Murray Valley, Australia. Epidemics usually occur due to either infected birds or mosquitoes migrating from endemic areas to non-endemic areas. The New South Wales government has placed 'sentinel flocks' of chickens near known bird breeding sites as an early warning system. These flocks are tested for MVE during the mosquito breeding season. Presentation The majority of MVEV infections are sub-clinical, i.e. do not produce disease symptoms, although some people may experience a mild form of the disease with symptoms such as fever, headaches, nausea and vomiting and only a very small number of these cases go on to develop MVE. In fact, serological surveys which measure the level of anti-MVEV antibodies within the population estimate that only one in 800‚Äì1000 of all infections result in clinical disease. The incubation period following exposure to the virus is around 1 to 4 weeks. Following infection, a person has lifelong immunity to the virus. When a patient appears to show MVE symptoms and has been in an MVE-endemic area during the wet season, when outbreaks usually occur, MVE infection must be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, usually by detection of a significant rise of MVE-specific antibodies in the patient's serum. Of those who contract MVE, one-quarter die from the disease. Clone The scientific study of the genetics of MVEV has been facilitated by the construction and manipulation of an infectious cDNA clone of the virus. Mutations in the envelope gene have been linked to the attenuation of disease in mouse models of infection.

Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people. In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many middle schools across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools. Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx in New York City.  Benefits  Deborah Meier has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy‚Äîthey should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school. Positive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California.

(2009). Learning Supports and Small Schools. Los Angeles, CA: Author. Leading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalitionhttp://www.smallschoolscoalition.com and the Grauer School Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, \\"Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer.\\" Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: \\"Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one (2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride‚Äîsacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning.\\"Grauer School Small schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of The Washington Post Writers Group, \\"far and away the biggest catalyst is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less‚Äî41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model.\\"Peirce, Neal. \\"COULD SMALLER SCHOOLS BE THE AMERICAN FUTURE?\\" The Washington Post Writers Group, 21 March 2004. Research and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts. According to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co- director of the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University, \\"Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities.\\"Shakrani, Sharif. \\"A Big Idea: Smaller High Schools.\\" Education Policy Center, Michigan State University (2008). Shakrani also states that \\"a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates.\\"  Criticisms  Many criticisms stem from the fact that the term \\"small school\\" is not uniform. For instance, schools of between 400 and 1,200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied). Hence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones.Jehlen, Alain and Cynthia Kopkowski (February 2006) \\"Is Smaller Better?\\" NEA Today. The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.Shaw, Linda (November 5, 2006) \\"Foundation's small-schools experiment has yet to yield big results.\\" Seattle Times.

She began her career as a lithographer and painter of portraits, collaborating with Walter Anderson on portraits of American Episcopal bishops. Her work, Elaine, was the first public collection purchase of a woman artist. Her painting No Walk Today was purchased for more than ¬£1 million. Early life Sophie was born in Paris, the daughter of Charles Antoine Colomb Gengembre, a French architect and artist, and his English wife, Marianne Farey (1799-1883), a daughter of John Farey Sr. (1766-1826) and his wife Sophia Hubert (1770-1830). They married at St Pancras Church, London, on 12 April 1818 Her father was born in 1790 and began working as an architect at age 19. He worked primarily in municipal commissions, like the Mint of the City of Cassel, which he designed and built when he was 19. He was injured during the Revolution of 1830 on the same day that his son Philip was born. The family then went to London, where Gengembre worked as an architect for Charles Fourier. He returned to France and continued his work as an architect, designing communal schools around France. The family moved to America and adopted the surname Hubert, because of difficulties in people pronouncing their french surname. After moving to Cincinnati, Ohio, he settled in Manchester, Pennsylvania, and by 1863 had designed pro bono the Allegheny City Hall. He stopped speaking English in protest after he was offered a share of the graft of over-inflated construction costs. They lived in Paris during the early years of Sophie's life, where her father was acquainted with artists, intellectuals, and actors, like Fran√ßois Joseph Talma. Circumstances required that the family leave Paris and live in a \\"remote area in France\\" from 1829 to 1843. At seventeen she developed an interest in art when a travelling portrait painter visited her town. She had two brothers, Philip and Henry P. Gengembre. Her brother Philip changed his name to Philip Hubert, using his grandmother's maiden name, and was a successful architect in New York City. She was largely self-taught in art, but briefly studied portrait painting with Charles de Steuben in about 1843, when she lived with family friends in Paris. Soon after she began her studies, he left for Russia and did not return within the one year allotted for her studies. She did develop relationships with other women artists at the school where she gained a little more instruction. United States The song of the lark The family left France for the United States to escape the 1848 revolution. The family first settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she met her future husband, the British genre artist Walter Anderson. Her brother Henry P. Gengembre (b. 1825) was also an artist, active in Cincinnati in the early 1850s. Her portrait, figure and Brittany landscape paintings were exhibited in October 1849 at the Western Art Union Gallery. Also exhibited was a three panel set of Victorian London scenes entitled The Ladder of Love, which was described as \\"the lady, in her flowery 'May of Life,' awaits in her father's garden a stolen interview with her lover; in the second, she is seen eagerly caught in his impatient arms, ere he has yet left the ladder upon which he surmounted the garden wall; in the third, having received and given reveals of unfaltering love, she walks alone again ‚Äì beautiful in the enrobing light of a summer moon, happy in the assurance that the warmth and devotedness of her affection is reciprocated.\\" In 1851 four or more of her illustrations were included in the Historical Collections of the Great West by Henry Howe. She collaborated with Walter Anderson, her future husband, on portraits of Protestant Episcopal bishops and created other portraits in her business. She then lived in Manchester, Pennsylvania, with her parents, where she is believed to have married Walter Anderson. She worked there for the chromolithographers Louis Prang & Company. Europe A portrait of a fairy (1869). The title of the painting is Take the Fair Face of Woman, and Gently Suspending, With Butterflies, Flowers, and Jewels Attending, Thus Your Fairy is Made of Most Beautiful Things ‚Äì purportedly from a poem by Charles Ede. In 1854 the Andersons moved to London, where Sophie exhibited a still life of fruit, vegetables, game, and fish entitled An American Market Basket at the Society of British Artists by 1855. It was considered an \\"admirable composition\\" made with \\"surprising truth\\". Her genre pieces were also exhibited at the Royal Academy. They returned to Pennsylvania in 1858 for a long visit with her family, during which time she exhibited at the Pittsburgh Artist's Association in 1859 and 1860. The latter year she and her husband had work shown at the National Academy of Design. She then settled in London again around 1863. Elaine (1870) Anderson's work was widely exhibited at venues including the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA), and the British Institution. Her work, Elaine, was one of the first public collection purchases of a living woman artist. The Marquis de Murrieta contributed the painting A Fairy Messenger to a mixed charity exhibition in 1871.The painting was in the 'Exhibition for the Benefit of the Distressed Peasantry of France', London in 1871 (no.55) and priced 15 guineas. Her oil painting Foundling Girls at Prayer in the Chapel (mid-c19th ‚Äì late-c19th) is displayed at the Foundling Museum; correlating well with Anderson's typical genre painting of children and women and the Museum's focus. The painting depicts the varying ages of the foundling girls, what they wore, and references the religious aspects of their life. To manage her health issue, the couple moved to the Isle of Capri in 1871, where they lived, painted, and entertained society in a house with a large garden called Villa Castello. Capri was an artist colony at that time, its residents included Frederic Leighton, Walter McLaren, John Singer Sargent, Edouard Alexandre Sain, and Jean Benner. She exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery between 1878 and 1887. Anderson made Italian genre and Neoclassical paintings, including paintings of peasant women and children. At a time when it was difficult for women to have a successful artistic career, these paintings, generally made by men, allowed for her to have a successful career. Later years and death The couple moved to England in 1894 and lived and painted in Wood Lane Cottage in Falmouth, Cornwall. She continued to exhibit her work in London. On 11 January 1903 her husband Walter died and two months later, on 10 March 1903, she died at home in Falmouth. She was buried at Swanvale cemetery in Falmouth in the same grave as her husband. Legacy A world record price for her work of more than ¬£1 million was achieved by No Walk Today at Sotheby's, London, in November 2008. It made her \\"Cornwall's first million-pound female artist.\\" Anderson's work is in the collection of numerous museums and galleries, mainly in the United Kingdom, including Leicester Museum & Art Gallery; Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum, Bournemouth; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Birmingham City Art Gallery; Museum and Art Gallery, Walsall, Staffordshire; and the Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Staffordshire.

They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated .

The 4th Fleet Incident occurred only a year after her commissioning, and Shikinami was quickly taken back to the shipyards to have her hull strengthened. Operational history On completion, Shikinami, along with her sister ships, , , and , were assigned to Destroyer Division 19 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino- Japanese War in 1937, Shikinami covered landing of Japanese forces in Shanghai and Hangzhou.

This differs from deep veins that are far from the surface. Superficial veins are not paired with an artery, unlike the deep veins, which typically have an artery with the same name close by. Superficial veins are important physiologically for cooling of the body. When the body is too hot the body shunts blood from the deep veins to the superficial veins, to facilitate heat transfer to the surroundings. Superficial veins can be seen under the skin. Those below the level of the heart tend to bulge out. This can be readily witnessed in the hand: raised above the heart and the blood should drain; lowered below the heart and it will fill. Veins become more visually prominent when lifting heavy weight, especially after a period of proper strength training. Physiologically, the superficial veins are not as important as the deep veins (as they carry less blood) and are sometimes removed in a procedure called vein stripping, which is used to treat varicose veins.

She was the first ship to honor the historic Battle of Saratoga. Having disappeared in 1781, her fate remains a mystery. Saratoga was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Warton and Humphries. She was begun in December 1779 and launched on 10 April 1780. First cruise=Diplomatic escort= Commanded by Captain John Young, Saratoga departed Philadelphia on 13 August 1780 escorting the packet, Mercury, which was sailing for Europe carrying Henry Laurens. The former President of the Continental Congress was planning to seek money on the European continent to finance the American government. Two days later, the Saratoga passed frigates and in the upper Delaware Bay. Captain Young and Henry Laurens communicated with the frigates and they were to join Saratoga in a cruise as a squadron. The frigates, continued on up the Delaware River to replenish at Philadelphia. After waiting in vain for the frigates to return, Saratoga and Mercury passed through the Delaware Capes out to sea by themselves. Because of inadequate ballast, the Saratoga was unstable under a heavy spread of canvas and was forced to proceed much more slowly than the Mercury. Thus, the Mercury was forced to heave to each night to allow the Saratoga to catch up. This schedule continued until 23 August, when Henry Laurens released the Saratoga from her escorting duty with the suggestion that she \\"...make a short cruise and then return to Philadelphia...\\" Afterwards, the unescorted Mercury was captured by the British off Newfoundland and Laurens was imprisoned in England. =Hunting off Delaware= For more than a fortnight, Captain Young operated east of the shipping lanes while he trained his crew in operating their ship and fighting her guns. On the afternoon of 9 September, a lookout spotted a sail to the northwest. By then, Young had managed to get Saratoga into fighting shape. He headed his ship toward the unknown sail and set out in pursuit. By twilight, he was close enough to see that his quarry was a brig flying British colors. Some two hours later, Saratoga had closed within hailing distance and learned that the chase was the Royal Navy's brig, , and not about to surrender. Saratoga opened fire with a broadside and was quickly answered by Keppel, opening an inconclusive, three- hour battle. During the action, due to gale force seas, coinciding with her insufficient ballast, the Saratogas guns were unable to inflict any serious damage on Keppel. After Captain Young‚Äôs repeated efforts to close to boarding distance of the Keppel and the British brig evading those efforts, and midnight approaching, Young ordered the helmsman to end the chase and head for home. =Capture of the Sarah= Three days later, as Saratoga approached Cape Henlopen, she came upon the Sarah, a British ship bound for New York laden with rum from the West Indies. The merchantman surrendered without resisting, and the two ships proceeded into the Delaware. They anchored off Chester, Pennsylvania, the following afternoon where the Sarah was promptly condemned and sold, along with her cargo, which brought the continental treasury funds desperately needed to refit the frigate, , for sea. Second cruise The Saratoga spent three days at Chester, where she replenished her stores and took on additional iron for ballast before heading back down the Delaware toward the open sea and another cruise. She cleared the Delaware Capes on 18 September and sailed northward along the New Jersey coast. A week later, off the Jersey highlands, she came upon the Elizabeth, which had been taken in Chesapeake Bay several weeks before by British privateer, Restoration. The Saratoga captured the 60-ton American brig, and Captain Young sent the brig to Philadelphia under a prize crew. Saratoga remained in the vicinity of the Jersey highlands without encountering any further ships. Toward the end of the month, she turned south. The Saratoga cruised parallel to the coast. Captain Young constantly exercised her crew at her guns and in her rigging to sharpen their fighting capability. The crew had an opportunity to prove their seamanship when on 10 October they safely brought their ship through a storm with but superficial damage. This same storm decimated the British squadron which Admiral Rodney had sent out of New York to patrol the American coast. =Capture of the Charming Molly= That night, she turned north again. At dawn the next day, she spotted two sails far off her port bow. The Saratoga was due east of Cape Henry when she began the chase. As she closed the distance between herself and her quarry, Captain Young ordered his helmsman to head for the open water between the enemy ships which proved to be the large, 22-gun letter of marquee ship, Charming Molly, and a small schooner, the Two Brothers. When the Saratoga was between the two English vessels, Captain Young ordered the Charming Molly to surrender, but she refused to do so. After the Saratoga had fired a broadside into the Charming Molly, a boarding party, led by Lt. Joshua Barney, leapt to the merchantman's deck and opened a fierce hand-to-hand fight which soon compelled the British captain to lower his colors. An American prize crew under Lieutenant Barney promptly took the place of Charming Mollys British skipper, officers, and tars. Captain Young then set out after the fleeing sloop the Two Brothers which, when overtaken, surrendered without resistance. The second prize, Two Brothers, promptly headed for the Delaware for libeling in Admiralty court in Philadelphia. =Further prizes= From the prisoners captured on the Charming Molly, Captain Young learned that she and the Two Brothers had been part of a small merchant fleet which had sailed from Jamaica and had been scattered by the recent storm. As soon as his crew had finished temporary repairs to Charming Mollys battle-damaged hull, the Saratoga began to search for the remaining merchant fleet, a ship and two brigs. About mid-day on 11 October, a lookout saw three sails slowly rise above the horizon dead ahead, and another chase began. As the Saratoga approached the strangers, Captain Young ordered his helmsman to head between the ships. As she passed between the enemy vessels, she fired both broadsides, her port guns fired at the Elizabeth, and her starboard muzzles belched fire and iron at the brig Nancy. The enemy's shots passed above the Saratoga, causing only minor damage to her rigging while the first American salvo knocked the Nancy out of action and did substantial damage to the Elizabeth, which surrendered after taking another volley. Meanwhile, the other brig raced away; and Captain Young, being busy with his two new prizes, allowed her to escape free of pursuit. The Saratogas crew labored repairing the battered hulls of the prizes before sending them toward the Delaware Capes. About midnight, the Saratoga herself got underway northward. At dawn, near Cape Henlopen, a blue jacket sailor aloft reported seeing two unknown sails, one dead ahead and the other several miles off her port quarter. The first was later identified as American brig, Providence which was at that time a British prize heading for New York. The second ship was the 74-gun British ship-of-the-line, . Despite the proximity of the British man-of-war, Captain Young set out after the Providence and recaptured her after about an hour's chase. Captain Young quickly put a prize crew on board the Providence and then the Saratoga got underway for the Delaware. The Saratoga was anchored off Chester, Pennsylvania, at dawn on 14 October. Cruise to the Caribbean On 15 December, after being refitted at Philadelphia, the Saratoga got underway for Hispaniola to pick up a load of French military supplies which were awaiting transportation to America. New officers and men had come on board to replace those who had left the ship to man her prizes. A number of merchantmen awaited her just inside the capes hoping to be escorted to a safe offing. On the morning of 20 October, favorable weather enabled the Saratoga to put to sea escorting her 12 charges. The next afternoon, after one of the merchantmen signaled that an unknown sail had appeared, Saratoga set out to investigate. Within two hours, after seeing the British ensign flying from her mast, the Saratoga had reached within firing range and sent a warning 4-pounder shot across the stranger's bow. Instead of surrendering, the British privateer, Resolution, maneuvered to attack. The ships fired at the same instant, Resolutions gunners fired high and only did superficial damage to the Saratoga. The Saratogas broadside damaged the Resolutions hull and superstructure and forced her to surrender. Captain Young embarked the Resolutions crew in Saratoga as prisoners; and placed an American crew on the prize. The two ships then headed toward Cape Henlopen which they reached on New Year's Day, 1781. Captain Young turned his prisoners over to the Continental agent at Lewes, Delaware, and headed the Saratoga back toward the Caribbean the same day. On the morning of 9 January 1781, off the coast of then England's loyal province of East Florida, the Saratoga captured a 20-gun letter of marquee the Tonyn in a fierce battle. The Tonyn had recently sailed from St. Augustine laden with turpentine, indigo, hides, and deerskins intended for Liverpool England. Captain Young spent a day repairing the Tonyn and the Saratogas rigging, then the two ships got underway on the morning of 11 January for Hispaniola. On the 16th, Saratoga captured, without resistance, an armed brig, the Douglas, which was carrying wine from Madeira to Charleston, South Carolina, that important Southern port which had fallen into British hands. Captain Young sent this prize to Philadelphia. =Escort duty and loss= On 27 January, the Saratoga and the Tonyn reached Cap-Fran√ßais where Captain Young turned the Tonyn over to the French Admiralty court and arranged to have Saratoga docked to have her hull scraped and coated with pitch while awaiting the arrival of military cargo and French frigates to assist in convoying a fleet of Allied merchantmen. The governor of the French colony of Saint Dominique suggested that the Saratoga join her sister Continental frigates, the and the Confederacy, an American privateer, the Fair American, and a French naval brig, Cat, in a cruise through the Windward Passage to Jamaica. The little fleet departed Cap-Fran√ßais on 20 February and returned eight days later with a British ship the Diamond, which they had captured as she approached Jamaica laden with plunder taken by the British during Admiral Rodney's conquest of the Dutch Island, St. Eustatius. By mid- March, all was ready. The French warships were on hand; the Continental warships were loaded, and 29 heavily laden merchant ships were in the harbor awaiting escorts. The convoy left from Cap-Fran√ßais on the 15th, the ides of March. Three days later on 18 March, a lookout high over the Saratogas deck reported two sails far off to westward, the Saratoga left the convoy in pursuit of the strangers. About mid-afternoon, she caught up with one of the fleeing ships which surrendered without a fight. Captain Young placed an American crew on board the prize and got underway after the second ship. Midshipman Penfield, commander of the prize crew, later reported that as he was supervising his men's efforts to follow the Saratoga, the wind suddenly rose to fearful velocity and almost capsized his ship. When he had managed to get the snow-rigged merchantman back under control, he looked up and was horrified to learn that the Saratoga had vanished. After numerous successful victories and prizes, Saratoga disappeared, lost at sea. The Saratogas fate remains a mystery.

The airport is owned by the Salina Airport Authority. It is primarily used for general aviation operations, with service by one passenger airline, SkyWest Airlines (operating as United Express), subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. Salina Regional Airport is the home of the Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus Aviation Program with degrees available in Airport Management, Aviation Certificates, Aviation Electronics, Aviation Maintenance Management, Aviation Safety, Professional Pilot, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Design and Integration, and Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight and Operations. History The airport is on the site of the former Schilling Air Force Base (previously known as Smoky Hill Army Air Field and Smoky Hill Air Force Base). The construction of military airfields after the Pearl Harbor Attack that caused the entry of the United States into World War II resulted in the construction of the Smoky Hill Army Air Field (AAF) on , southwest of Salina, Kansas. The first unit associated with the airfield was the 376th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, whose engineers first laid out the base in April 1942. Construction began in May 1942 with the aid of nearly 7,000 construction workers. The airfield was officially activated on 1 September 1942 and was assigned to the II Bomber Command, Second Air Force.KANSAS HISTORICAL QUARTERLY, Summer 1959 issueAFHRA Smoky Hill Army Air Field Enough construction was completed that the 376th moved into facilities on 10 September. The first aircraft to arrive, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, arrived later that month and were assigned to the 346th Bombardment Group. The mission of Smoky Hill AAF was that of a Second Phase Heavy Bomber Operational Training Unit (OTU). Combat groups formed in First Phase training were reassigned to the airfield, training focused to teamwork of the combat crew was stressed: bombing, gunnery, and instrument flight missions were performed by full crews. Upon completion, the groups moved on to third phase the final level of training before overseas deployment to the combat theaters.Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . The 366th was joined by the 400th Bombardment Group in the training mission at Smoky Hill AAF on 31 July 1943. The 366th concentrated on B-17 Flying Fortress training; the 400th on B-24 Liberator training. The airport was the takeoff and landing point for the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, flown by Steve Fossett in the first nonstop, non- refueled solo circumnavigation of the earth from February 28 to March 3, 2005. Fossett's later nonstop non-refueled solo circumnavigation in the GlobalFlyer was also Salina to Salina, from March 14 to March 17, 2006, setting a new record for greatest distance traveled on a closed course. Salina Regional Airport has memorialized the records set by Steve Fossett with Fossett Plaza. The plaza features a memorial, seating area, plaques with the story of the Global Flyer and Steve Fossett, and a viewing area to observe the many flight operations at the airport. The airport used to be served by Great Lakes Airlines under the Essential Air Service program, however currently it is served by United Express.  Facilities and aircraft  Salina Regional Airport covers 2,862 acres (1,158 ha) at an elevation of 1,288 feet (393 m) above mean sea level. It has four asphalt runways: 17/35 is 12,300 by 150 feet (3,749 x 46 m); 12/30 is 6,510 by 100 feet (1,984 x 30 m); 18/36 is 4,301 by 75 feet (1,311 x 23 m); 4/22 is 3,648 by 75 feet (1,112 x 23 m). In the year ending January 30, 2014 the airport had 91,101 aircraft operations from general aviation, air taxi, military, and scheduled commercial. Possessed of such a long runway and located approximately 85 miles southeast from the continental center of the United States, many corporate and private jets stop at this airport to refuel and allow passengers to have a break, earning Salina the moniker \\"America's Fuel Stop.\\" Avflight Salina is responsible for all fueling and ground handling of transient and military aircraft. The airport also hosts a variety of Forward Operating Location (FOL) activity and has been the operating site for many missions by NASA, NOAA, Wings of Freedom, the Commemorative Air Force and Virgin Atlantic Global. Airline and destinations=Passenger=Environmental contamination A report from the 40th Bombardment Wing in 1953 described the problem. \\"One of the foremost and the first problems encountered was an excessive amount of solvent being required to properly wash and clean aircraft,\\" the report said. \\"Some method of reducing the amount of solvent used was needed. This problem was met by installing a system of settling tanks ... Approximately 12,000 to 14,000 gallons of solvent are used per month.\\" In 1989, the Salina School District unearthed three of 107 underground fuel storage tanks on its vo-tech property. It first became known that Trichlorethylene (TCE), a degreaser used to clean aircraft and a carcinogen, as well as other compounds disposed of on the former base, have migrated into the soil and groundwater, forming a toxic plume. In 1999, the US Army Corps of Engineers published its first remedial investigation. In 2005, the Corps shared the draft of a second remedial investigation of the contamination in the Salina Airport Industrial Area. Residents in the area of the plume were advised not to drink the water, per the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Soilwater intrusion assays in 1999 by EPA and again in 2005 showed vapor levels inside Kansas State University's Tullis building did not exceed state standards for air quality, but they may exceed federal EPA guidelines. As of 2005, the federal government had spent more than $17 million studying the problem in its jurisdiction. In December 2007 the Corps groundwater contamination cleanup was put on hold. In August 2008, the city of Salina offered to clean-up former Schilling AFB, as suggested by the Corps. In 2010, after the plume had reached residential areas near the former base, Salina officials, the Salina Airport Authority, the Salina school district and Kansas State University ‚Äì Salina (now Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus), who own 96% of the property filed a federal lawsuit in Kansas City, Kansas, for the clean up costs. In spring of 2013 the Department of Justice signed a settlement that the government would pay $8.4 million merely toward developing the plan to clean up the former base. A remedial investigation, feasibility study and cleanup remedy were estimated to cost about $9.3 million, of which the Salina public entities agreed to pay $936,300. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment oversees the cleanup process. As of September 2015 studies have continued to find groundwater contamination in soil and bedrock, and no concentrations of vapor requiring immediate action were found in an area around Salina Regional Airport.

Founded in 1948, Stonehill is located on the original estate of Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. with 29 buildings that complement the original Georgian-style Ames mansion. Stonehill College was founded by the Congregation of Holy Cross. Stonehill's engineering majors spend their last four semesters of undergraduate education at the University of Notre Dame, Stonehill's sister institution and another institution founded by the Congregation of the Holy Cross.  History  In the autumn of 1934, the Holy Cross Fathers in North Dartmouth began to look for new quarters because of increasing seminary enrollment. The current Stonehill campus was purchased from Mrs. Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. on October 17, 1935. The initial purchase included and the original Ames mansion; the congregation purchased the remaining from Mrs. Cutler two years later. Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. was the great-grandson of Oliver Ames, Sr., who came to Easton in 1803 and established the Ames Shovel Company. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts authorized the Congregation of Holy Cross to establish Stonehill College on the Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. estate on June 30, 1948. In September of that year the college enrolled 134 men as the first class. Classes were held in the mansion and in the Ames Gym. The first building built by the college was the Science Building which opened in February 1949. In 1974 the building was renovated and renamed the Tracy Science Building in honor of David Tracy, a former Stonehill advisor and trustee. After the opening of the Shields Science Center in 2009 the building was converted to be used by university administration. In June 2017 the college announced that W.B. Mason would be donating $10 million to open the Leo J. Meehan School of Business. The school is named after alumnus and W.B. Mason CEO Leo Meehan, and accommodates programs in accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, economics, and healthcare administration. The first issue of the College newspaper, The Summit, was published on November 3, 1949. In the fall of 1951 the college decided to become a coeducational organization and enrolled 19 women. The first class graduated from Stonehill on the first Sunday of June 1952 and consisted of 73 men. Academics=Degrees and academic programs= Through the May School of Arts and Sciences and the Meehan School of Business, Stonehill awards on the undergraduate level the B.A., B.S., and B.S.B.A. They have also added several master's degree programs. The Integrated Marketing Communications master's program was launched during the 2017-18 school year, a Special Education (K-8) program was launched in May 2019, and a Data Analytics program will launch in Fall of 2020. Stonehill offers 47 major programs, the opportunity to double major or participate in one of the college's 51 minor programs. =The MacPhaidin Library= The MacPhaidin Library, named in honor of Stonehill College's eighth president, Father Bartley MacPhaidin, C.S.C., was constructed in 1997 and opened in May 1998, at the college in North Easton, Massachusetts. The MacPhaidin Library is three stories high and covers 600,000 square feet. It houses a collection of 250,000 print volumes, including more than 100 full-text databases and indexes, and two computer labs.

These powers come at the cost of Rukia's own, and as a result, Ichigo concedes to work as Rukia's stand-in, fighting to protect people from evil spirits called Hollows and sending good spirits, wholes, to a dimension known as the Soul Society. In addition to the manga series, Ichigo appears in many other pieces of Bleach media, including the anime series, the four featured films, the two original video animations, rock musicals, several video games, light novels and the 2018 live-action film. Kubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role. His character has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump character popularity polls. He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in Bleach. The 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti-hero. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of Bleach, Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. In the live-action film, he is played by Sota Fukushi. Creation and conception When drawing the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach character he introduced, was originally intended to be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch.Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump interview, year 2004, issue 42 While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile. Kubo has stated that Ichigo's greatest strength is his considerate and thoughtful nature; he always thinks about other's needs. However, he also noted it as his greatest weakness, since worrying about his friends tends to put him in danger. When asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo, Orihime, and Rukia, Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn't want to focus on romance. Kubo attributes Ichigo's popularity among readers to the fact that he \\"looks cool\\". He also mentioned that as people read more about him they will discover that he is a warm and kind-hearted person. Following over fifty volumes of the manga's released, Kubo believes that Ichigo was the most developed character. He said that Ichigo leads the story and introduces readers to the events in it. When the Arrancar arc ended, Kubo rebooted the series which resulted in Ichigo losing his Soul Reaper powers. In the same way Ichigo became a Soul Reaper during the series' first chapter; he starts searching for methods to recover his original powers. Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while as a child he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Morita said that Ichigo was one of his favorite characters he ever played alongside Tidus from Final Fantasy X. Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While describing Ichigo as one of his best roles, Morita notes that voicing him can be at times difficult. Bosch has enjoyed voicing Ichigo's character due to his personal interest in the character's morals. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time. Sota Fukushi portrays Ichigo in the live-action adaptation of the series which adapts the storyline's first arc, with Johnny Yong Bosch reprising his role in the film's English dub. Appearances=In Bleach= Ichigo is one of the teenagers attending Karakura High School and having the ability to see ghosts. He meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki from a secret organization called the Soul Society who are in charge of sending souls to the afterlife. At the same time, Ichigo's family is attacked by a Hollow, a deceased spirit that became a warped soul-eating monster which Soul Reapers deal with. After being wounded in an attempt to shield Ichigo from a Hollow attack, Rukia transmits her Soul Reaper powers to him so he can save his family. In following months, Ichigo acts in Rukia's place as the Soul Reaper in protecting Karakura Town from Hollows as their friendship continues to bloom. Ichigo's past is also revealed as he faces the Grand Fisher, a hollow who killed his mother when he was nine years old. In time, the Soul Society sends two high-seated officers to take Rukia back for committing the crime of transferring her Soul Reaper powers to a human. In training with Kisuke Urahara in order to rescue Rukia, Ichigo obtains his own Soul Reaper powers and learns the name of his Zanpakut≈ç, . In his search for Rukia, Ichigo is confronted by members of Gotei 13, the main military force in the Soul Society. As he approaches the prison where Rukia is being held captive, Ichigo does battle with, faces and defeats enemy Soul Reapers including Renji Abarai, Kenpachi Zaraki, Byakuya Kuchiki, who adopted Rukia as his sister. For his match against Byakuya, Ichigo learns his Bankai, , which highly increases his speed. After a long fight, he defeats Byakuya, who confesses why he tried to kill his sister. Captain S≈çsuke Aizen, who faked his death prior, have been behind Rukia's sentencing and the chaos that plagued the Soul Society. He flees to Hollows' realm of Hueco Mundo before the other Soul Reapers can apprehend him. Ichigo's appearance while performing Bankai and using his Hollow powers. In time, Aizen begins targeting Karakura Town with an army of Arrancars, Hollows that assumed human form with Soul Reaper powers, after subjecting them to the H≈çgyoku. In order to defeat the Arrancars and to control his Hollow powers, Ichigo begins his training with the group of Soul Reaper outcasts known as the Vizard. During the Arrancar's attack on Karakura Town, Ichigo's friend Orihime Inoue has been abducted by Ulquiorra Cifer of the Aizen's strongest Arrancars: The Espadas. When the Soul Society refuses to help save Orihime, Ichigo and his friends go to Hueco Mundo to rescue her. In Hueco Mundo, after defeating the Espada Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez, Ichigo manages to save Orihime and defeat Ulquiorra. Soon after, Ichigo returns from Hueco Mundo to Karakura Town, and confront Aizen. During the battles interim, Ichigo learns a technique called the that weakens and defeats Aizen, allowing Urahara to seal him within a kid≈ç barrier, at the expense of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers. Seventeen months later, Ichigo becomes a senior in high school. The start of the Lost Agent arc describes Ichigo's life after he loses his Soul Reaper powers. One day, he meets K≈´go Ginj≈ç, a Fullbringer from the group Xcution. Ginjo offers to replenish Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers in return for helping him and his group to become ordinary humans. With their help, Ichigo unlocks his own Fullbring powers through his Substitute Soul Reaper Badge. However, Ichigo later learns that Ginjo and his ally Sh≈´kur≈ç Tsukishima, a Fullbringer with ability to change people's memories, used him to take Fullbring powers for Xcution's use. Luckily, Rukia transfers the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami through a special sword and restores Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo fights Ginjo with his improved Shinigami powers and during their duel, it is revealed that Ginjo was the first Substitute Soul Reaper. Despite learning the truth, Ichigo resolves to protect everyone and kill Ginjo, which he does after a prolonged fight. Though learning from Ginj≈ç that the Soul Society monitor and limit their powers, Ichigo tells the Court Squad that he will continue to fight by their side as he asks for their consent to bury Ginj≈ç. While patrolling Karakura Town, Ichigo is informed about invasion of Hueco Mundo by Wandenreich, a group of Quincies. He goes to Hueco Mundo with his friends to liberate it from one of the Wandenreich's high-ranked officers Quilge Opie. After dealing with Opie, Ichigo finds out that the Quincies are attacking the Soul Society. Arriving just after Captain Commander Yamamoto's death, Ichigo encounters the Wandenreich's leader Yhwach. During the fight against Yhwach that ends with a draw, Ichigo's Zanpakut≈ç is shattered while attempting to stop Yhwach from retreating. Ichigo goes back to the World of Living where he learns the truth that his mother was a pure-blood Quincy who was on a verge of hollowification after she was infected by White, Aizen's experimental Hollow. She was saved by Isshin at the cost of his Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo later learns that entity he believed to be Zangetsu is actually the embodiment of his Quincy powers while his inner Hollow is the true Zangetsu. Despite this, Ichigo still accept him as he gains his reforged Zanpakut≈ç in its new split Shikai form. During the second invasion by the Wandenreich, Ichigo and his friends confront Yhwach at the Soul King's Palace. During the prolonged fight that followed, Ichigo is defeated by Yhwach, but Tsukishima and Orihime's combined efforts fixed his broken Tensa Zangetsu, allowing him to pursue Yhwach. Together with Renji and Aizen, Ichigo faces Yhwach once again and finally kills the Quincy. As revealed in the light novel Bleach: Can't Fear Your Own World, Ichigo was a potential heir of the Soul King due to the nature of his origins and was spared the burden when a new Soul King was created from Yhwach's remains. The manga's epilogue, taking place ten years after Yhwach's defeat, depicts Ichigo and Orihime with a son named Kazui, who destroys the remnants of Yhwach's power. =In other media= Ichigo appears in each films for the series, including Memories of Nobody; The DiamondDust Rebellion; Fade to Black and Hell Verse. He also appears in both of the original video animations; fighting against a Hollow called the Grand Fisher in the first one and combating the rogue Soul Reaper Baishin in the second. In the Bleach video games, Ichigo is a playable character, including the Heat the Soul and Blade Battlers series. In some games, his Hollow form and Bankai state are available as separate characters. In Rock Musical Bleach, a musical based on the Bleach series, Ichigo is played by Tatsuya Isaka. His character is featured in two volumes from the Bleach Beat Collection CD soundtrack series which features themes composed by his Japanese voice actor, Masakazu Morita. These include the first of them, in which he is the only character and the fourth season's fourth volume along with Rukia. Ichigo also appears in the first volume of Bleach Breathless Collection CD soundtrack series together with the embodiment of his Quincy powers that posed as the Zanpakut≈ç spirit Zangetsu. Reception Amongst the Bleach reader base, Ichigo has been always highly ranked in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump popularity polls for the series. He has usually taken first place, though in early 2008 he dropped to third.Bleach manga; chapter 209, pages 2 and 3.Bleach manga Character Poll; chapter 307, pages 1 and 2. His sword, Zangetsu, also ranked third in the Zanpakut≈ç popularity polls. In the 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine poll, Ichigo was ranked one of the best male anime characters. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA), Ichigo was elected for the best anime male character in 2008. The Japanese music distributor Recochoku has made two annual survey of which anime characters that people would like to marry. Ichigo ranked tenth in the category \\"The Character I Want to Be My Groom\\" from the 2008 survey and eight in the 2009 poll. Wizard Entertainment considered Ichigo the best hero from 2007, commenting that he doesn't try to be a typical hero but he fights in order to protect his friends. He was also 20th in IGN's \\"Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time\\" with comments focused on his design and personality. Ichigo has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007, Masakazu Morita won in the category \\"Best Rookie Actor\\" for his role as Ichigo Kurosaki. Ichigo's voice actor in the English adaptation, Johnny Yong Bosch, has also been praised for his voice work on Ichigo's character by Anime News Network (ANN), which favorably compared Bosch and Morita's work. Various merchandise based on Ichigo's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key-chains. Since the series was released, replica models of Ichigo's Zanpakut≈ç and Bankai have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans. Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Ichigo's character. ANN's Melissa Harper commented that Ichigo's initial rebellious actions make him almost a stereotypical anti-hero, but note that he is soon revealed to be a more complex character with a sad past. Los Angeles Timess Charles Solomon comments Ichigo's character has little in common with protagonists from other series due to his bad temper and how he tends to fight. However, he added that readers from the series still \\"love\\" Ichigo. The way Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper was found to be relatively common by Carlos Alexandre. He noted that Ichigo's character of a \\"tough guy with a heart of gold\\" had already been done in several series. Charles White from IGN praised Ichigo's climactic fight against Byakuya Kuchiki as one of the best fights in the Bleach series, and later Ramsey Isler gave additional praise to both the design and voice acting for Ichigo's inner Hollow. Ichigo's development during the Rescue arc in which he sets to save Rukia Kuchiki from being executed have been praised by ANN's Theron Martin. He praised the scenes in which Ichigo manages to stop Rukia's execution and his subsequent demonstration of his Bankai as one of the \\"eminently satisfying landmark moments in the series\\". Wired News's Corrina Lawson stated that she liked Ichigo's strong sense of responsibility, and commented it was one of the reasons of the series' popularity. During the serialization of the manga, Tite Kubo said he received a letter from a reader who decided to name his son \\"Ichigo\\". This brought joy as well as fear to the manga artist due to how his work influenced other people. While feeling that he also made a good manga during this comment, Kubo decided to work more on the character in hopes that once the real Ichigo grows up, he would feel proud with his name.

Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry, and primarily Protestant but with some ties with Catholic lay groups and individuals. Logos Foundation was Reconstructionist, Restorationist, and Dominionist in its theology and works. Early history It was established by Paul Collins in New Zealand as a trans-denominational teaching ministry serving the Charismatic Renewal through publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins moved it to Sydney, Australia, c.1969, where it also facilitated large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook, lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales for a few years, and in the mid-1970s to Blackheath, upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like-minded fellowships and home groups into loose association with it. Publishing became a significant operation, distributing charismatic themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre-eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine, USA). It held annual weeklong conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including Derek Prince, Ern Baxter, Don Basham, Charles Simpson, Bob Mumford, Kevin Conner (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others. A Bible College was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, Mountains Christian Academy was established which was a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the Old Covenant practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this. Theologically it taught orthodox Christian core beliefs - however in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged. Those who questioned this teaching tended to leave the movement eventually. Over time, a strong cult-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question were quickly brought into line by other members with automated responses shrouded in spiritualised expression. In some instances the leadership engaged in bullying-type behavior to enforce unquestioning compliance. The group viewed itself as separate from 'the world' and any alternative views and even other expressions, denominations or interpretations of Christianity were regarded at best as suspect but mostly as false. From the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the Shepherding Movement's whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their \\"cell group\\" leader), who in turn were accountable also to their personal pastors. Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, USA (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak c.1985). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with Ern Baxter, a pioneer of the Healing Revival of the 1950s and the Charismatic Renewal of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time. In 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name, Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the Covenant Evangelical Church (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the USA). The Logos Foundation brand name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the Covenant Evangelical Church. It moved for the final time in 1986 to Toowoomba, Queensland where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements. This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people. The 1980s move to Queensland The move to Toowoomba involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in New South Wales and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the Darling Downs. In the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, it absorbed a number of other small Christian Churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations. Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals. Carter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature. More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more authoritarian and cultish. Colin Shaw was a key member at this time, who believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an \\"anointed man of God\\" and Shaw later became the \\"right-hand\\" man of Carter in his \\"outreach and missionary works\\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used this Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored under the Christian Renewal Centre's name, conferences featuring Carter. Many poorly educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches were influenced to support the wider Logos movement and to tithe from their limited funds into it. However, soon after the revelation of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to abandon the Shepherding movement at this time and engaged in soul searching and self exile for a time, fueled by severe guilt over the way these Filipino Christians were manipulated. In 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the Queensland State election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Published advertisements in the Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty. Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties. This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream Churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing them. At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law. The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when they published, \\"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\\" The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \\"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\\". These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated \\"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\\". Although similar behaviours existed prior, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation develop cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power. Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of 'spiritual covering' became a dominant theme in their teaching. This idea of spiritual covering soon perverted into a system of overt abuse of power over people's lives. This occurred despite opposition to the Shepherding movement from respected evangelical and Pentecostal leaders in the United States beginning as early as 1975. However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time that it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America. Followers in Australia, were effectively quarantined by Carter from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A. Other connections The movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), California; Christian Growth Ministries, Fort Lauderdale; and Rousas Rushdoony, the father of Christian Reconstructionism in the United States. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home schooling and ministry training. Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word \\"University\\". Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree in 1987 which was apparently issued by the Pacific College Theological. Visiting preachers from the United States were frequently gifted such 'qualifications' by Carter including a PhD purportedly issued by the University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus. The recipient thereafter used the title of Doctor in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America. Demise, dissolution and ongoing influence today The Shepherding movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people, to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix. Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position. The Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not survive long the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of adultery in 1990. Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis, \\"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\\". Like many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, he was placed on a pedestal by the movement's followers. This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability, allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years. In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed. Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first class flights and five-star hotels. The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive. Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were being channelled nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds were being managed. A significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba.

Mattel's popular Shogun Warriors toy collection included Getter Robo G's robot formations in that toy line: Getter Dragon (Dragun), Getter Liger (Raider), and Getter Poseidon (Poseidon). As a result of the popularity of these toys in the US, Jim Terry included this series in his Force Five anime lineup under the title of Starvengers. Some Starvengers episodes were re-dubbed and released by FB Productions under the Robo Formers title. The original Getter Robo series, however, has yet to appear in the U.S. (although the Shin Getter Robo OVAs have appeared). In the UK, Starvengers episodes were released on video by Krypton Force under the name Formators. Plot After the final defeat of the Dinosaur Empire and the death of Musashi Tomoe in the original Getter Robo series, Dr. Saotome (Dr. Copernicus in Starvengers), creator of Getter Robo, fears that the peace the Getter Robo team has won will be short lived and that even greater enemies will appear. Dr. Saotome's fears are justified when the Hundred Demon Empire (Hyakki Teikoku, also known as the Pandemonium Empire in Starvengers) appears. Composed of horned, devil-like alien humanoids and possessing a technology advanced enough to build giant demonic robots, this militaristic organization intends to steal Saotome's Getter Generator to fulfill their own goals of world domination. However, Dr. Saotome is prepared with the creation of an even more powerful Getter Robo, Getter Robo G and a new Getter Robo base. Also, with Musashi dead, Dr. Saotome needs a third pilot, which he finds in baseball player Benkei Kuruma. Getter Machines Like its predecessor, Getter Robo G is composed of three jet-like vehicles piloted by one of the three pilots. Dragon is the red jet, controlled by the pilot of Getter Dragon. Liger, the blue jet, is used by Getter Liger's pilot. Getter Poseidon's operator uses Poseidon, the yellow machine. All three are armed with missiles but are generally very weak and never used in combat unless absolutely necessary. They also appear when the pilots use the Open Get (Break Formation in the English Version) verbal command to break up the current form, so that they can change into another, or so they can dodge an enemy's attack. *Getter Dragon (formed from Dragon+Liger+Poseidon) - English Version - Star Dragon - piloted by Ryoma Nagare, English Version - Homer Winthrow *Getter Liger (formed from Liger+Poseidon+Dragon) - English Version - Star Arrow - piloted by Hayato Jin, but piloted by Michiru when Hayato is captured near the end.

Produced by Ben Schwalb and directed by Edward Bernds, it stars Zsa Zsa Gabor, Eric Fleming, and Laurie Mitchell. The screenplay by Charles Beaumont, about a revolt against a cruel Venusian queen, is based on an idea supplied by Ben Hecht and originally titled Queen of the Universe. Upon its release, the film was promoted by Allied Artists and distributed to some locations as part of a double feature with Frankenstein 1970 starring Boris Karloff. Plot In 1985,https://variety.com/1957/film/reviews/queen- of-outer-space-1200419077/ Captain Patterson (Eric Fleming) and his space crew (Dave Willock, Patrick Waltz and Paul Birch) take a rocket to a space station near Earth. En route, however, the space station is destroyed by an interstellar energy beam which also affects their rocketship. The space crew crash land on Venus and are captured. They learn the planet is under the dictatorship of the cruel Queen Yllana (Laurie Mitchell), a masked woman who has most men killed, keeping only mathematicians and scientists on a prison colony moon which orbits Venus. In the palace, the astronauts are aided by a beautiful courtier named Talleah (Zsa Zsa Gabor) and her friends (Lisa Davis, Barbara Darrow and Marilyn Buferd). The women long for the love of men again and plot to overthrow the evil queen to reestablish the \\"old order\\". Once Patterson is alone with the queen in her bedchamber, he has the opportunity to remove her mask, revealing that her face is horribly disfigured due to radiation burns caused by men during a war between Venus and another planet \\"10 Earth years ago\\". Later, in a fury, the queen decides to destroy Earth to protect her world and to preserve her own power. In the presence of her armed guards, Talleah and the crewmen can only watch as she aims the energy-beam \\"disintegrator\\" at Earth. Just after the queen activates the weapon, Talleah's allies arrive. As a large struggle ensues, the disintegrator begins to malfunction, explodes, and the queen dies. Talleah is now the new leader of Venus and at a subsequent ceremony announces that Patterson's rocket has been repaired and he and his crew can return to Earth. Talleah's technicians have also repaired the \\"electronic televiewer\\", which allows space command on Earth to contact Patterson. Command orders him not to attempt a return home but to remain on Venus for at least a year, until a relief expedition can arrive. Although the crew could return to Earth in their repaired ship, they are elated to follow orders and stay. The film ends with the men and Venusians celebrating in a flurry of hugs and passionate kisses. Cast * Zsa Zsa Gabor as Talleah * Eric Fleming as Captain Neal Patterson * Dave Willock as Lt.

Venusians are played by Tania Velia, Norma Young, Marjorie Durant, Brandy Bryan, Ruth Lewis, June McCall, and Marilyn Buferd, who was a former Miss America (1946). This was Buferd's final role in her decade-plus film career. Production The Three Stooges and the Bowery Boys director Edward Bernds recalled that, after producer Walter Wanger was released from prison for shooting agent Jennings Lang in the groin for having an affair with his wife Joan Bennett, Wanger could only find work at the low-rent Allied Artists (formerly Monogram Pictures). In 1952, Wanger brought a ten-page idea for a screenplay by Ben Hecht called Queen of the Universe that was a satirical look at a planet run by women. Several years later, with the idea of science fiction films being more common, Allied Artists revived the project with Wanger replaced on the film by Ben Schwalb, who was then producing the Bowery Boys films. Screenwriter Charles Beaumont did not think there was much in the Hecht screenplay, but Schwalb suggested spoofing the idea and had former Three Stooges screenwriter Ellwood Ullman touch up Beaumont's screenplay. Allied Artists retitled the film Queen of Outer Space as they thought the original title sounded more like a beauty pageant. The central plot of a planet ruled by women was recycled from other science fiction productions of the era, including Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953), Cat-Women of the Moon (1953), and the British feature Fire Maidens from Outer Space (1955). Queen of Outer Space also recycled many props, costumes, and other elements used in earlier films of the 1950s, most prominently the C-57D crewmen's uniforms and Altaira's wardrobe from Forbidden Planet (1956); models, sets, and special effects from Bernds' World Without End (1956); stock footage of an Atlas missile taking off; and a model rocketship built for Flight to Mars (1951). The model was used as well by the Bowery Boys in Paris Playboys (1954), which was co-written by Bernds and Ullman. It is noteworthy too tha the queen's guards wore uniforms that foreshadow (and may have influenced) those worn on the later Star Trek television series, coming in the same three Starfleet colors; red, blue, and gold. In her 1991 autobiography One Lifetime is Not Enough, Gabor recounts a memorable line of her dialogue in the film and cites the production costs for creating the highly tailored fashions worn by her character: Reception In 1958, the film received generally positive reviews from critics in major newspapers and in trade publications. Most reviewers, including Charles Stinson of the Los Angeles Times, approached the film in their assessments as an amusing, mildly erotic parody or spoof, not as a true science fiction offering or even a faintly serious space adventure. In his November 13 review, Stinson characterizes the feature as \\"cheery frivolity\\" with \\"well-constructed cheesecake\\", all of which is visually punctuated by \\"luscious DeLuxe color\\".Stinson, Charles (1958). \\"Zsa Zsa Gags It Up as 'Queen of Space'\\", Los Angeles Times, November 13, 1958, p. B12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. He even compliments Gabor's performance: Marjory Adams, writing for The Boston Globe, also recognized the Gabor vehicle as a \\"merry spoof of science fiction\\" that no one either on the screen or in theater audiences takes seriously, especially with regard to the actors' lines. \\"The dialogue\\", notes Adams, \\"is of the sort which might be written by a high school freshman\\", adding \\"the only unexpected twist is [Zsa Zsa] isn't the queen.\\"Adams, Marjory (1958). \\"ZSA ZSA OUT OF THIS WORLD: She Saves Rocket Squadron\\", The Boston Globe, October 25, 1958, p. 24.

It was one of the first newspapers to publish Matt Groening's Life in Hell and Rob Brezsny's Real Astrology. The company is operated by its founder and longtime executive editor, Dan Pulcrano.  History  In 1985 Dan Pulcrano invited David Cohen to launch Metro. From on initial circulation of 40,000 it grew to approximately 100,000. In 1990, Metro acquired Los Gatos Weekly and the Los Gatos Times-Observer and then merged to become Los Gatos Weekly-Times. Metro Santa Cruz began publishing in 1994. The same year, Metro Newspapers purchased the Sonoma County Independent, which, in October 2000, expanded its distribution to cover Napa and Marin counties and is now published under the North Bay Bohemian flag. In March 2009, on the publication's 15th anniversary, Metro Santa Cruz was renamed Santa Cruz Weekly. In March 2014, Metro Newspapers acquired Good Times, the Gilroy Dispatch, the Hollister Free Lance and the Morgan Hill Times, and merged Good Times and the Santa Cruz Weekly.Metro Newspapers buys weeklies in Santa Cruz, Gilroy, Morgan Hill and Hollister In 2015, Metro acquired the Pacific Sun; the Bohemian ceased distribution in Marin County and increased its Sonoma County and Napa County distribution. In 2020, the company introduced the Weeklys brand, acquired the East Bay Express, launched East Bay magazine and acquired the Scotts Valley- based Press Banner. Silicon Valley Community Newspapers Metro developed a group of weekly community newspapers, including the Los Gatos Weekly-Times, Saratoga News, Campbell Reporter, Willow Glen Resident and Sunnyvale Sun. Under Metro's ownership, the group won numerous awards, including the California Newspaper Publishers Association's \\"General Excellence\\" award in its Better Newspapers Contest. On December 17, 2001, David Cohen, a co-founder of Metro, bought the group, which at the time included six publications and left to run Silicon Valley Community Newspapers as an independent company. Cohen sold it three years later to Knight Ridder which sold the group to McClatchy Corp. McClatchy immediately resold SVCN to Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group. In 2014, Bay Area News Group marketing director Erika Brown announced that the newspapers would be distributed to subscribers of the Mercury News, rather than generally to homes in the community. Early online player Metro was an early participant in the online publishing revolution, in 1993 launching the Livewire online service, one of the first online efforts by a non-daily newspaper publisher. The service offered free email accounts, online commerce, chats, posting forums, and online articles. Virtual Valley, a similar service with an emphasis on covering Silicon Valley communities, was launched the following year and helped put the city governments of San Jose, Milpitas and Los Gatos online. Also in 1994, Metro established Boulevards, a network of web sites, each covering a major U.S. metropolitan area, that pre- dated Citysearch and Microsoft's short-lived \\"Sidewalk\\" service.

It can also be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of lactide , the cyclic dimer of the basic repeating unit. PLA has become a popular material due to it being economically produced from renewable resources. In 2010, PLA had the second highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world, although it is still not a commodity polymer. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings. PLA is the most widely used plastic filament material in 3D printing. The name \\"polylactic acid\\" does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, and is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid (polyelectrolyte), but rather a polyester.  Production  The monomer is typically made from fermented plant starch such as from corn, cassava, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp. Several industrial routes afford usable (i.e. high molecular weight) PLA. Two main monomers are used: lactic acid, and the cyclic di-ester, lactide. The most common route to PLA is the ring-opening polymerization of lactide with various metal catalysts (typically tin octoate) in solution or as a suspension. The metal-catalyzed reaction tends to cause racemization of the PLA, reducing its stereoregularity compared to the starting material (usually corn starch). The direct condensation of lactic acid monomers can also be used to produce PLA. This process needs to be carried out at less than 200 ¬∞C; above that temperature, the entropically favored lactide monomer is generated. This reaction generates one equivalent of water for every condensation (esterification) step. The condensation reaction is reversible and subject to equilibrium, so removal of water is required to generate high molecular weight species. Water removal by application of a vacuum or by azeotropic distillation is required to drive the reaction toward polycondensation. Molecular weights of 130 kDa can be obtained this way. Even higher molecular weights can be attained by carefully crystallizing the crude polymer from the melt. Carboxylic acid and alcohol end groups are thus concentrated in the amorphous region of the solid polymer, and so they can react. Molecular weights of 128‚Äì152 kDa are obtainable thus. :Two main routes to PLA Polymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides usually leads to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), which is amorphous. Use of stereospecific catalysts can lead to heterotactic PLA which has been found to show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, and to a lesser extent on the type of catalyst used. Apart from lactic acid and lactide, lactic acid O-carboxyanhydride (\\"lac-OCA\\"), a five-membered cyclic compound has been used academically as well. This compound is more reactive than lactide, because its polymerization is driven by the loss of one equivalent of carbon dioxide per equivalent of lactic acid. Water is not a co- product. The direct biosynthesis of PLA similar to the poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s has been reported as well. Another method devised is by contacting lactic acid with a zeolite. This condensation reaction is a one-step process, and runs about 100 ¬∞C lower in temperature.  Properties = Chemical properties = Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly-L-lactide (PLLA) is the product resulting from polymerization of L,L-lactide (also known as L-lactide). PLA is soluble in solvents, hot benzene, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane. = Physical and mechanical properties = PLA polymers range from amorphous glassy polymer to semi-crystalline and highly crystalline polymer with a glass transition 60‚Äì65 ¬∞C, a melting temperature 130-180 ¬∞C, and a tensile modulus 2.7‚Äì16 GPa. Heat- resistant PLA can withstand temperatures of 110 ¬∞C. The basic mechanical properties of PLA are between those of polystyrene and PET. The melting temperature of PLLA can be increased by 40‚Äì50 ¬∞C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60 ¬∞C to up to 190 ¬∞C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 1:1 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 3‚Äì10% of PDLA, there is still a substantial improvement. In the latter case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent, thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA. The flexural modulus of PLA is higher than polystyrene and PLA has good heat sealability. Several technologies such as annealing, adding nucleating agents, forming composites with fibers or nano- particles, chain extending and introducing crosslink structures have been used to enhance the mechanical properties of PLA polymers. Polylactic acid can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber (for example, using conventional melt spinning processes) and film. PLA has similar mechanical properties to PETE polymer, but has a significantly lower maximum continuous use temperature. With high surface energy, PLA has easy printability which makes it widely used in 3-D printing. The tensile strength for 3-D printed PLA was previously determined. There is also poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLDLLA) ‚Äì used as PLDLLA/TCP scaffolds for bone engineering. =Solvent welding= PLA can be solvent welded using dichloromethane. Acetone also softens the surface of PLA, making it sticky without dissolving it, for welding to another PLA surface. = Organic solvents for PLA = PLA is soluble in a range of organic solvents. Ethylacetate, due to its ease of access and low risk of use, is of most interest. PLA 3D printer filament dissolves when soaked in ethylacetate, making it a useful solvent for cleaning 3D printing extruder heads or removing PLA supports. The boiling point of ethylacetate is low enough to also smooth PLA in a vapor chamber, similar to using acetone vapor to smooth ABS. Other safe solvents to use include propylene carbonate, which is safer than ethylacetate but is difficult to purchase commercially. Pyridine can also be used however this is less safe than ethylacetate and propylene carbonate. It also has a distinct bad fish odor.  Applications  PLA is used as a feedstock material in desktop fused filament fabrication 3D printers (e.g. RepRap). PLA-printed solids can be encased in plaster-like moulding materials, then burned out in a furnace, so that the resulting void can be filled with molten metal. This is known as \\"lost PLA casting\\", a type of investment casting. PLA can degrade into innocuous lactic acid, so it is used as medical implants in the form of anchors, screws, plates, pins, rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented. PLA can also be used as a decomposable packaging material, either cast, injection-molded, or spun. Cups and bags have been made from this material. In the form of a film, it shrinks upon heating, allowing it to be used in shrink tunnels. It is useful for producing loose-fill packaging, compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware. In the form of fibers and nonwoven fabrics, PLA also has many potential uses, for example as upholstery, disposable garments, awnings, feminine hygiene products, and diapers. Thanks to its bio-compatibility and biodegradability, PLA has also found ample interest as a polymeric scaffold for drug delivery purposes. Racemic and regular PLLA has a low glass transition temperature, which is undesirable. A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures, lending it more mechanical strength. It has a wide range of applications, such as woven shirts (ironability), microwavable trays, hot-fill applications and even engineering plastics (in this case, the stereocomplex is blended with a rubber-like polymer such as ABS). Such blends also have good form stability and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra, a long-lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for treating lipoatrophy of cheeks. Progress in biotechnology has resulted in the development of commercial production of the D enantiomer form, something that was not possible until recently.

File:3D Printed Macrognathism.jpg3D printed human skull with data from computed tomography. Transparent PLA.  Degradation  PLA is degraded abiotically by three mechanisms: # Hydrolysis: The ester groups of the main chain are cleaved, thus reducing molecular weight. # Thermal degradation: A complex phenomenon leading to the appearance of different compounds such as lighter molecules and linear and cyclic oligomers with different Mw, and lactide. # Photodegradation: UV radiation induces degradation. This is a factor mainly where PLA is exposed to sunlight in its applications in plasticulture, packaging containers and films. The hydrolytic reaction is: -COO + H2O -> - COOH + -OH- The degradation rate is very slow in ambient temperatures. A 2017 study found that at 25 ¬∞C in seawater, PLA showed no degradation over a year. Pure PLA foams are selectively hydrolysed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (a solution mimicking body fluid). After 30 days of submersion in DMEM+FBS, a PLLA scaffold lost about 20% of its weight. PLA samples of various molecular weights were degraded into methyl lactate (a green solvent) by using a metal complex catalyst. PLA also be degraded by some bacteria, such as Amycolatopsis and Saccharothrix. A purified protease from Amycolatopsis sp., PLA depolymerase, can also degrade PLA. Enzymes such as pronase and most effectively proteinase K from Tritirachium album degrade PLA.  End of life  SPI resin ID code 7 Four possible end of life scenarios are the most common: # Recycling: which can be either chemical or mechanical. Currently, the SPI resin identification code 7 (\\"others\\") is applicable for PLA. In Belgium, Galactic started the first pilot unit to chemically recycle PLA (Loopla) . Unlike mechanical recycling, waste material can hold various contaminants. Polylactic acid can be chemically recycled to monomer by thermal depolymerization or hydrolysis. When purified, the monomer can be used for the manufacturing of virgin PLA with no loss of original properties (cradle-to-cradle recycling). End-of-life PLA can be chemically recycled to methyl lactate by transesterification. # Composting: PLA is biodegradable under industrial composting conditions, starting with chemical hydrolysis process, followed by the microbial digestion, to ultimately degrade the PLA. # Incineration: PLA can be incinerated, leaving no residue and producing 19.5 MJ/kg (8,368 btu/lb) of energy. # Landfill: the least preferable option is landfilling because PLA degrades very slowly in ambient temperatures.

It was replaced by The Void in 2005, and The Outlet in 2006. The show is targeted to children between the ages of eight and 12. Sally Gifford and Anthony McLean are in-studio hosts, who interview celebrities and do various comedy segments. The roles of the cast are not fixed and often vary. Morgan Waters goes on the road, across the country, interviewing children, ordinary people, and sometimes celebrities as well. At its inception, the program was named the InfoMatrix, was hosted by McLean and provided Canadian history. Gifford then joined the cast, followed by Morgan Waters, then Kythrine Butcher. Anthony left at one point (there was a special episode dedicated to his leaving), and Waters moved on to The Morgan Waters Show. Recurring segments *In each Professor Peabody segment, the professor thinks he has invented something new, but finds out his inventions are hardly original.

Ammon and his wife had originally married on February 2, 1986, and had two children, the twins Greg Ammon and Alexa Ammon, whom they adopted from the village of Medvedivtsi in the Mukachevo Region of Ukraine, in October 1992. At the time of the murder, the couple were near finalization of their divorce. The custody agreement had been signed on October 18, 2001, and the divorce settlement was expected to be consented to the following week. Four months after Ted's death, Generosa married Daniel Pelosi on January 15, 2002; she died of cancer on August 22, 2003. Early life Ted Ammon was born to Robert E Ammon, a pension coordinator from Shenango Furnace Co., Neville Island and Betty Lee Morris, a homemaker, on August 30, 1949 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ted graduated from Bucknell University. He entered the Bank of America's executive-training program following his graduation from Bucknell. His first wife, Randee Day, was also a member of the program. They married in 1973 and moved to England. Ted passed the New York bar the first time, without taking a law-school class. Career After the Ammons moved back to the United States, he secured a position with Lord, Day and Lord. He subsequently went to work at the law firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt. One of this firm's clients was the then small investment firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR). In 1983, following his legal work on a KKR deal (and his divorce from his first wife), Ammon was recruited by the private equity firm, which specialized in leveraged buyouts. Ammon served as an Associate at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. from 1984 to 1989 and as a General Partner from 1990 to 1992. He worked on many deals, notably the famous $31 billion RJ Reynolds/Nabisco takeover. He joined his colleagues in becoming a multimillionaire and was quoted numerous times in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. According to Russ Baker in the May 2002 issue of Gotham, \\"He was along for the wild ride as KKR grew into one of Wall Street's most aggressive and storied leveraged buyout outfits.\\" In 1992, Ammon left KKR in order to establish his own company, Big Flower Press. The firm became a leader in the printing of advertising inserts for newspapers. Ammon's goal was to create relationships with newspapers nationwide and then to provide them with other needed commodities. Big Flower was later renamed Vertis Holdings, Inc. Through more than thirty acquisitions, the firm diversified geographically and became a leading international supplier of integrated marketing services, including high-value printing, advertising, and imaging technology. Vertis went public in 1995; in 1999, it was acquired by a group of investors, including Ammon, in a private leveraged recapitalization. Ammon served as Chief Executive Officer from the company's inception until April 1997 and as Chairman of the Board from the company's formation through December 2000. With Vertis facing dramatically changing market conditions (e.g., a high debt multiple and a slowing pace of acquisitions), a mutually advantageous separation/payout agreement was worked out between Vertis and Ammon. During his time at Vertis, Ammon had put together a \\"deal team\\" and venture capital program, managing an in-house venture business. He also had set up several holding companies, which held the vast share of his ownership interests. These ventures directly invested in both public and non-public companies and in such general areas as technology, media, marketing and management services, and the internet. The specific fields of these companies included print and digital technology, diagnostic radiology, long-distance telephone service, and biopharmaceutical innovation. After leaving Vertis, Ted oversaw his team's venture capital investments through the entities that he had established. Much of the money that Vertis had paid to Ammon provided seed money for his investments. Two of the most profitable investments were in Moore Corporation Limited, a Vertis competitor, and in National Imaging Associates, Inc., a provider of health care services. Divorce and murder Ted's marriage turned hostile after Generosa found a receipt for a divorce lawyer in his desk. They were days from finalizing their divorce when on October 22, 2001, he was found bludgeoned to death in his East Hampton, NY weekend home. Because their divorce was not finalized and Ted's will had not been changed, Generosa inherited 50% of his estate, in accordance with the will, with the balance going to the Ammon Foundation. On January 15, 2002, Generosa married Daniel Pelosi, then sold the properties she had owned jointly with Ted.Widow's Walk New York Observer 22 December 2002. Retrieved on 13 September 2008 JPMorgan Chase & Co. was appointed along with Generosa as co- executors of the estate. Ultimately, Generosa's estate inherited Ted's estate. The estate did not pass until after her death. Pelosi was convicted of Mr. Ammon's murder in December 2004 and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Charity With a total net worth of some $100 million, Ammon created the largest scholarship fund at Bucknell. Subsequently, he complemented this endowed program with a challenge/matching grant, resulting in added incentives for others to contribute to his alma mater. He served on the boards of the Municipal Art Society, and the YMCA. He attained to the title of Chairman at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he worked closely with Wynton Marsalis. On October 22, 2012, Greg and Alexa Ammon donated a $1 million gift from the Ammon Foundation to Jazz at Lincoln Center to name the R. Theodore Ammon Archives and Music Library. \\"Ted considered the archive and music library essential to the integrity of this institution. The Ammon Archives and Music Library will be accessible to students and lovers of jazz the world over,\\" said Wynton Marsalis, Managing and Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. \\"My father's deep commitment to Jazz at Lincoln Center inspired my sister Alexa and I to continue his legacy with this naming gift for the preservation and perpetuation of the music he loved so much. Wynton's vision for The Ammon Archive and Music Library aligns with my father's commitment to enrich people's lives around the world with jazz,\\" said Greg Ammon. \\"Ammon Org gifts Lincoln Center 22 October 2012 On November 15, 2012, Jazz at Lincoln Center hosted a private ribbon cutting for The Ammon Archives and Music Library followed by the New York City film premiere of Greg Ammon's documentary, 59 Middle Lane later that evening. Proceeds from the premiere event benefited Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute. Funeral Thousands of people attended a Manhattan memorial service for Ammon in Alice Tully Hall, the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Among the Wall Street dignitaries in attendance were Henry Kravis, head of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co, Apollo Capital chief Leon Black, and Roger Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary under U.S. President Bill Clinton. Ammon's two children sat with the family but without their mother since, at the request of Ammon's sister Sandra, Generosa did not attend. At the service, Wynton Marsalis honored Ammon with a New-Orleans-style jazz send-off. Before playing the funeral march, Marsalis spoke to the congregation. \\"We want to know the particulars of death ‚Äî it repulses us, it calls us, it fascinates us ... but only the dead know the facts of death, and they never tell.\\"Widow's Walk New York Observer 22 December 2002. Generosa died of breast cancer in August 2003. She left the majority of her estate to the twins, and legal guardianship of them to their nanny, Kaye Mayne. Full custody of the twins was eventually awarded to Ammon's sister; they spent the remainder of their childhood with her in Huntsville, Alabama. David Sutcliffe played Ammon in the TV movie Murder in the Hamptons (also known as \\"Million Dollar Murder\\"). Grandmother His maternal grandmother was Neva Morris of Ames, Iowa, (August 3, 1895 - April 6, 2010), who at age 114 was the oldest person in the United States when she died.

Biography Carter was born to Claude and Enid Carter in Auckland, New Zealand. He earned a Diploma of Teaching at the Auckland Teachers College in 1956. After gaining his teaching qualification he worked as a teacher at District High School, Reporoa, New Zealand, in 1960 and 1961. In 1962, he gained a Licentiate of Theology (LTh) from Whitley College, Melbourne, and, in 1965, a Diploma of Ministry from the Baptist Theological College, Auckland. He was a minister at the Manurewa Baptist Church in New Zealand from 1962 to 1968. He awarded himself a Master of Arts degree (Pacific College Theological) in 1987. =1968-1979= In the late 1960s and 1970s, Carter he was influential in the charismatic movement's growth in mainstream churches in Australia and New Zealand, regularly organising \\"Holy Spirit Teaching Seminars\\" in Sydney. His teaching was centred on themes of Christ's authority, \\"victorious living\\" and charismatic gifts. The majority of his teachings were distributed through Logos Foundation's \\"Restore\\" magazine and short books. Carter was a charismatic leader who became involved with a number of fundamentalist authoritarian Protestant religious groups and churches in Australia and the South Pacific. Carter moved his family from New Zealand to Australia in 1969. In the mid-1970s he was instrumental in introducing to Oceania the Shepherding Movement and associated discipleship from the \\"Fort Lauderdale Five\\" of Christian Growth Ministries (CGM) in the U.S.A. The movement promoted a pyramid-like authoritarian hierarchy, in which each \\"disciple\\" was accountable to a personal pastor (usually the leader of the \\"Household\\" - the name used for cell groups) for whole-of-life direction and personal decisions, and written covenants were encouraged. All these aspects theologically distanced the Logos movement from the majority of mainstream Protestant Christians. Doctrines of submission to God's delegated authorities in order to provide \\"covering\\" and complete spiritual protection were regularly promoted and were narrowly applied to wives obeying husbands, children obeying parents and disciples obeying leaders. The concept gained momentum over time and was eventually exercised in an almost cult-like manner. Leaders in the movement were required to be addressed by titles \\"Brother\\" and \\"Sister\\", which had a side effect of distancing them socially even further from the ordinary members in the movement. \\"Brother Howard\\" announced that he was in \\"a submitted relationship\\" to the CGM apostolic group of Bob Mumford, Ern Baxter, Charles Simpson, Derek Prince and Don Basham. While the teachings appeared to be biblical and promoted disciplined living, the result for non- leaders was a disempowering of their abilities and a neglect of their individual gifts and insights. =1980-1992= In 1980, the Logos-related churches became the Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities and in the mid-1980s were renamed the Covenant Evangelical Church. In the early 1980s, Carter led the Logos movement through a shift in eschatology from pre- millenarianism (described as a theology of defeat) to post-millenarianism (described as a theology of victory) of the specific stream of Dominionist, Reconstructionist Theology. Carter's interpretations and teaching became more extreme, and his style more cultish and authoritarian, causing some of his leadership team, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre, Sydney, to leave the movement. A key member at that time, Colin Shaw, believed that Carter was an \\"anointed man of God\\" and Shaw later became the Carter's \\"right-hand\\" man in his \\"outreach and missionary works\\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used the Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church), as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Shaw coordinated and sponsored conferences featuring Carter as the lead speaker, under the Christian Renewal Centre's name. However, soon after the revelation of Carter's lifestyle, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and dispersed back into established local churches. During that period, Carter lived an extravagant lifestyle which frequently involved first- class air travel to North American and other international locations, staying at five-star hotels, and indulging in many other luxuries that were beyond the means of his loyal supporters. He drove a Mercedes Benz and lived in a large mansion with magnificent views from the Toowoomba escarpment.Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides the Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990 The Logos Foundation even owned and operated a motel in Canada with Australian staff. The financial affairs of Logos Foundation were shrouded in secrecy from most followers with little or no accountability regarding the vast sums of money that had been accumulated.Courier-Mail Newspaper, 9 August 1990 In the 1989 Queensland State election, Carter advanced the position that adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine was a more important consideration than opposition to the widespread corruption in the conservative Queensland government that had been exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Carter's campaign was vehemently anti-homosexual and, at times, the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law. An article in The Sydney Morning Herald noted: \\"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern\\". The same article quoted from a letter Carter had written to supporters at the time: \\"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\\". An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman, in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of them, who stated \\"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\\".Lyons, J., God Remains an Issue in Queensland, Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989 At the peak of his power towards the end of that period, Carter used alleged \\"personal revelations from God\\" to exert enormous influence over the lives of his followers and the direction of the organization. His \\"revelations\\" were put on a par with scripture by his followers, and at times were effectively treated as being over and above scripture. That marked an effective shift from fundamentalist religion to the overt traits of a cult. The Sydney Morning Herald article in October 1990 quoted disillusioned followers as saying: \\"...we felt we had lost control over our lives. It was all dictated to us from above and that was very oppressive. Everything centered around Howard Carter; he had all the power\\". By the late 1980s, what remained of the Shepherding Movement worldwide had descended into manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. Carter played these factors skilfully to entrench his own position and ensure the continuation of Logos Foundation. In his 2010 thesis, Hey (2010) identified, \\"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\\" =1990-1991= In 1990, Carter lost control of Logos Foundation as a result of an adultery scandal. Carter's alleged submission and accountability to the Fort Lauderdale Five, who were purported to provide a fail-safe discipleship that would in part protect him from personal failures, was a farce. When Carter was exposed, it became known that he had engaged in \\"sexual affairs that dated back many years\\" Death and legacy Carter died from eye cancer in 1992 in Toowoomba, Queensland.

It is based on poems from Po√®mes anciens et romanesques (Henri de R√©gnier, 1890). Composition=\\"Three Scenes at Twilight\\"= Based on comments in various Debussy letters and in Leon Vallas's biography, it has generally been assumed that composition of the Nocturnes began in 1892 under the title Trois Sc√®nes au Cr√©puscule (\\"Three Scenes at Twilight\\"), an orchestral triptych. However, the lack of actual manuscripts makes it impossible to determine whether such works were truly related to the Nocturnes. Trois Sc√®nes au Cr√©puscule was inspired by ten poems by Henri de R√©gnier entitled Po√®mes anciens et romanesques (published in 1890). R√©gnier was a symbolist poet, and his poems contain vivid imagery and dreamlike associations of ideas. In a letter to Jacques Durand on 3 September 1907, Debussy writes \\"I am more and more convinced that music, by its very nature, is something that cannot be cast into a traditional and fixed form. It is made up of colors and rhythms\\"; he found suitable material in the imagery of these poems. Debussy may have begun creating the work for an intended performance in New York City, promoted and sponsored by Prince Andr√© Poniatowski, a banker and writer, and a confidant to whom Debussy frequently expressed himself in long letters. The New York performance was to consist of the premiere of Debussy's Fantaisie for piano and orchestra completed two years earlier, a rather traditional work in classical form but a tradition which Debussy in the next two years would reject and musically move away from (resulting in the Fantaisie never being performed or published in his lifetime); his experimental oratorio La Damoiselle √©lue, from four years prior, also still unperformed as yet; and the Twilight Scenes, which Debussy told the prince were \\"pretty much finished\\" even though he hadn't put anything on paper yet. The American concert deal fell through. Debussy was already working with difficulty on his opera Rodrigue et Chim√®ne, a biography of El Cid; it has been said that he eventually destroyed its complete score because he felt he could no longer write \\"that kind of music\\" to \\"that kind of literature\\", but his biographer says he merely concealed them and they remained in private collections. He was also working on another orchestral triptych after a cycle of three poems by another symbolist poet, St√©phane Mallarm√©, called L'apr√®s-midi d'un faune, that was more in keeping with the new style of music and inspiration Debussy was seeking. He had in fact asked Henri de R√©gnier, a close associate of Mallarm√©, to inform the latter of his interest in setting the poems to a new kind of musical impression. Mallarm√© was vehemently opposed to juxtaposing poetry and music and was strongly against Debussy's compositional idea. After he heard the completed Pr√©lude based on his first poem, however, Debussy had evidently caused him to completely reverse his belief, as he expressed his astonishment in lavishing praise and admiration in a personal letter to the composer. =Three Nocturnes for solo violin and partitioned orchestra= Nocturne in Black and Gold ‚Äì The Falling Rocket from a series of impressionist paintings by Whistler Meanwhile, Debussy's Sc√®nes au Cr√©puscule, after R√©gnier's poetry, were completed in piano score in 1893, but before Debussy had a chance to orchestrate them he attended the premiere performance of his String Quartet in G minor in December, given by the Ysa√øe Quartet led by Belgian violin virtuoso Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. Debussy was impressed and flattered by Ysa√øe's interest in his music and decided to rewrite his Twilight Scenes into a piece for solo violin and orchestra. In 1894, after completing the first movement of his Mallarm√© triptych entitled Pr√©lude (to \\"The Afternoon of a Faun\\"), he began the recomposition of the Twilight Scenes in a new inspired style, retitling the new version Nocturnes after a series of paintings of the same name by James McNeill Whistler, who was living in Paris at the time. In September he described the music to Ysa√øe as \\"an experiment in the different combinations that can be achieved with one colour‚Äîwhat a study in grey would be in painting\\". Whistler's most famous painting was a portrait of his mother called Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1. Debussy scored the orchestral part of the first of the three pieces for strings alone; the second for three flutes, four horns, three trumpets, and two harps; and the third for the two groupings together. The first version of the Nocturnes seems to be the one described; he later abandoned the idea of the solo violin arrangement when he was unable to get Ysa√øe to undertake the performance. Following the abandonment of Rodrigue et Chim√®ne in 1893, Debussy had immediately begun work on an opera more to his liking, Pell√©as et M√©lisande, which occupied him with no small measure of trouble over the next nine years, until it premiered on 30 April 1902. Thus it wasn't until 1896 that he informed Ysa√øe that the music for the Nocturnes had pretty much been completed and he still wanted Ysa√øe to perform the solo violin part. By 1897, Debussy had decided to dispense with a solo violin part and the orchestral groupings, and simply write all three movements for a full orchestra. He worked for the next two years on the Nocturnes, and once confessed to his friend and benefactor, the publisher Georges Hartmann, that he was finding it more difficult to compose these three orchestral nocturnes than a five-act opera. Wanting to equal the sensation caused by the success of \\"The Afternoon of a Faun\\" piece, he drove himself toward an over-perfectionism with the Nocturnes. Having worked on the composition for as long as seven years, constantly revising it and changing its very structure several times, he expected it to live up to his own grand, avant-garde views: =Completion and further revision= A full score of the manuscript of the Nocturnes was signed with the completion date of 15 December 1899. The manuscript bears a dedication to Georges Hartmann, who helped to support Debussy financially beginning in 1894. It was published under contract to Hartmann's publisher, under the Eug√®ne Fromont imprint in 1900. This printed score contained dozens of errors. The first two movements, Nuages and F√™tes, received their premiere on 9 December 1900 in Paris by the Lamoureux Orchestra conducted by Camille Chevillard. The third movement Sir√®nes could not be staged because the female choir needed for it was unavailable. The complete work was premiered by the same orchestra and conductor on 27 October 1901. Though these initial performances received a cool response from the public, they were more positively hailed by fellow musicians. A review by Pierre de Br√©ville in the Mercure de France has been translated as saying: \\"It is pure music, conceived beyond the limits of reality, in the world of dreams, among the ever-moving architecture that God builds with mists, the marvelous creations of the impalpable realms.\\" For several years after their publication, almost until the day he died, Debussy continued to tinker with the composition, at first making corrections to dozens of errors in his copy of the published score, then moving on to adjusting small passages and fundamentally revising the orchestration. Debussy made many subtle changes to Sir√®nes to integrate the wordless singing of the women's chorus with the orchestra. Two of these scores exist with Debussy's changes in different colors of pencils and inks, and often these changes are contradictory or simply alternate versions. As Debussy told conductor Ernest Ansermet when the latter asked which were the right ones: \\"I'm not really sure; they are all possibilities. Take this score with you and use whatever you like from it.\\" Debussy continued to modify the composition just as he had for the seven years prior to its publication, sometimes just not satisfied or sometimes thinking of a new experiment in sound, a new color combination of instrumental timbres he hadn't heard yet. Many of these changes were finally incorporated into a \\"definitive version\\" published in 1930 by Jobert. This version continues to be performed today. A comprehensive version addressing many more of Debussy's \\"possibilities\\" was published in 1999 by Durand, edited and annotated by Denis Herlin. One reviewer states \\"in this new critical edition for the Debussy ≈ìuvres compl√®tes, all of the most important questions concerning the establishment of a text of the Nocturnes for practical performance have been confidently answered.\\" Herlin has carefully traced and analyzed four printings of the Nocturnes by Fromont, ending in 1922; multiple scores by Jean Jobert between 1922 and 1930; multiple versions of a heavily revised Jobert score appearing between 1930 and 1964; a 1977 edition by Peters of Leipzig; and a study score from Durand. The Nocturnes were performed as a ballet in May 1913, with Loie Fuller dancing. The Nocturnes are considered one of Debussy's most accessible and popular works, admired for their beauty and for holding new possibilities and wonder upon repeated hearings. Movements There are three movements, each with a descriptive title. The entire work lasts approximately 25 minutes. Debussy wrote an \\"introductory note\\" to the Nocturnes and each of the individual movements, printed in the programme for the first complete performance in 1901: =I. Nuages (\\"Clouds\\")= Theme Parallel seventh chords Instrumentation 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 (soprano) clarinets in B, 3 bassoons; 4 valve (French) horns in F; 2 timpani in B & D, harp; (strings): 1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses.

NotesWhistler and Debussy Debussy's biographer, L√©on Vallas, said that Debussy's description of the Sirens movement reminded him of James Abbott McNeill Whistler's \\"Harmonies in blue and silver\\", saying \\"The painter was a favourite with Debussy, and their art has often been compared.\\" The two were mutual influences, with Whistler borrowing from musical vocabulary to name his pictures, while Debussy chose painters' terms to entitle his symphonies. Arrangements The complete work was transcribed in 1910 for two pianos by Maurice Ravel and Raoul Bardac (Debussy's pupil and stepson), and was first performed in 1911. F√™tes was arranged for solo piano by the English pianist Leonard Borwick, and the arrangement has been recorded by Emil Gilels, among others. F√™tes has also been transcribed for large symphonic wind ensemble by Merlin Patterson and William Schaefer.

Coolgardie safe at Kalgoorlie's Mining Museum, part of the Western Australian Museum. The Coolgardie safe is a low-tech food storage unit, using evaporative cooling to prolonging the life of whatever edibles are kept in it. It applies the basic principle of heat transfer which occurs during evaporation of water (see latent heat and heat of evaporation). It was named after the place where it was invented ‚Äì the small mining town of Coolgardie, Western Australia, near Kalgoorlie-Boulder. History Coolgardie was the site of a gold rush in the early 1890s, before the Kalgoorlie-Boulder gold rush. For the prospectors who had rushed here to find their fortune, one challenge was to extend the life of their perishable foods ‚Äì hence the invention of the Coolgardie safe. The safe was invented in the late 1890s by Arthur Patrick McCormick, who used the same principle as explorers and travelers in the Outback used to cool their canvas water bags: when the canvas bag is wet the fibers expand and it holds water. Some water seeps out and evaporates. It is most effective when air continually moves past it, such as when in a moving vehicle or when exposed to a breeze. This technology is commonly thought to have been adopted by explorer and scientist Thomas Mitchell, who had observed the way some Indigenous Australians used kangaroo skins to carry water.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/search_tags.php?tag=Food+safes  Principles of operation  The Coolgardie safe was made of wire mesh, hessian, a wooden frame and had a hot dip galvanised iron tray on top. The galvanised iron tray was filled with water. The hessian bag was hung over the side with one of the ends in the tray to soak up the water. Gradually the hessian bag, acting as a wick, would draw water from the tray by the process of capillary action. When a breeze came it would pass through the wet bag and evaporate the water. This would cool the air inside the safe, and in turn cool the food stored in the safe. This cooling is due to the water in the hessian needing energy to change state and evaporate. This energy is taken from the interior of the safe (metal mesh), thus making the interior cooler. There is a metal tray below the safe to catch excess water from the hessian. It was usually placed on a veranda where there was a breeze. The Coolgardie safe was a common household item in Australia until the mid-twentieth century. Safes could be purchased ready-made or easily constructed at home. Some of the metal panel safes are highly decorated.

Haskell was not the first physician to perform intact dilation and extraction. However, Haskell's 1992 presentation to the National Abortion Federation Risk Management Seminar in Dallas was the first detailed presentation of the technique.

The novel describes the adventures of a half-Native American, half-English woman, who is shipwrecked on an island. The protagonist uses her knowledge of Christianity to convert the indigenous inhabitants on the island as part of her survival mode. This work belongs to the literary genre of the Robinsonade, in that - like other works of its era - it emulates Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. Although there are many similarities to Defoe's novel, the differences are what make The Female American distinctive. For instance, the narrator is not only a woman but is also biracial, as the daughter of a Native American princess and an English settler who resided in Virginia. The protagonist is also multilingual. Although Defoe's protagonist (Robinson Crusoe) chooses to leave his home and set out into an unexplored and dangerous life abroad, Winkfield's protagonist's (Unca Eliza Winkfield) trials and adventures are forced upon her. It is only in the latter part of the narrative that the female protagonist finds a living condition on the island that is more favorable than her American or European origins. In addition, the novel engages with the theme of finding one's home away from the native land, which can be identified in a range of fiction of 18th-century England. While Defoe's protagonist remains condescending towards the native people that he encounters and easily deserts his companions for personal salvation, Winkfield's protagonist is compassionate and benevolent towards the indigenous community, embracing its practices. Similarly, the native people that Unca Eliza discovers easily accept Christianity unlike Man Friday in Michael Tournier's modern revision of the Robinson Crusoe narrative, Friday. Historical references to colonial America and eighteenth-century England, the fantasy of a feminist utopia, and the woman's role in colonialism and religious conversion are just a few of the components of this narrative. One of the criticisms that accompanied its publication in 1767 was that female readers might possibly partake in similar adventures, thus questioning their lives and limitations. The fear was that the virtue of the women of this period would be potentially endangered. In order to assuage such concerns, the introduction emphasizes that the story is not only \\"pleasing and instructive\\" but \\"fit to be perused by the youth of both sexes, as a rational, moral entertainment.\\" Plot summary=Volume I= The poem opens with a declaration of the author's intention to relate the events of her life, which introduces the first major theme of female adventure outside of the domestic sphere. She describes her grandfather's plantation in Virginia, and the massacre of settlers by the native Indians, which leaves her grandfather dead and her father, Mr. William Winkfield, captured. As her father is about to be put to death by the Indians, a young Indian princess, named Unca, saves his life and secures his liberty by taking a liking to him and putting him in favor with the king. Unfortunately, his troubles mount when the sister of the young princess grows equally fond of him, and solicits him for marriage. He responds unfavorably, claiming love only for Unca, so she poisons him and leaves him for dead. Unca comes upon him and saves his life yet again, and they remove themselves from the village to live with the settlers. They are not there long before their daughter, Unca Eliza, is born, and they are visited by two Indian men sent from Alluca, the jealous sister of princess Unca. The two men reveal daggers and a skirmish leaves Unca and one of the assassins dead, while Mr. Winkfield escapes death and takes the remaining assassin prisoner. Under the council of the other settlers, he decides to set him free, sending him back to the village with a promise of revenge on Alluca from Mr. Winkfield. She dies of grief before revenge can be had, and sends her heart and a request for forgiveness to Mr. Winkfield. Overcome with grief for his murdered wife, Mr. Winkfield decides to return to England with his daughter in order to take care of his sick brother. While there, Unca Eliza grows up in the company of her cousins, is educated and exposed to Christianity, under which she was baptized, and notes with what great attention the English attend to her due to the complexion of her skin and her mixed Indian and English dress. Shortly after arriving in England, the grief-stricken Mr. Winkfield desires to return to Virginia, but intends for Unca Eliza to remain in England to finish her education. When she is eighteen years old, she is summoned by her father to return, and she makes the journey alongside her cousin, John Winkfield, who solicits her for marriage. She denies him, claiming she will never marry a man who cannot use a bow and arrow any better than she. Soon after arriving back in Virginia, Unca Eliza's father dies, and she is left alone. She desires to return to England when she is twenty-four, so she purchases a sloop and assembles a crew for the journey. On the way, her chosen captain solicits her for marriage to his son, but she refuses in the same manner as before. He is outraged by this, and threatens to leave her on an uninhabited island - securing all her money to him - if she does not reconsider. An altercation ensues, and the captain is thrown overboard by two slaves. (He is later recovered.) He gives Unca Eliza another opportunity to reconsider, but she does not, and he leaves her on an uninhabited island. Once on the island, Unca Eliza, realizing she is a castaway grieves, then quickly devotes herself to God realizing how lucky she is to be alive. Unca Eliza finds an abandoned hermitage shortly after, which she takes as her shelter. Inside, she finds a manuscript of the previous occupant telling her how to survive as they have. The manuscript implies the occupant may soon be dead. She begins settling into her new lifestyle. She learns how to fend for herself and begrudgingly eats some goats and roots. After several weeks of this, she realizes the gravity of her situation and is much distressed, and comes down with a debilitating fever. Once she recovers, she consults the manuscript for more information, and learns that there is life on the island after all. She decides to explore her new habitation and understands the hermitage to be a religious temple of the sun, which contains numerous mummies. Upon returning from her explorations, she is startled by the presence of the hermit, who she thought was no longer on the island. The hermit dies overnight, and Unca Eliza makes more explorations and discovers an underground passageway leading to an idol of worship. While she is there she discovers that she can climb inside \\"the oracle\\" and it allows her voice to be heard for a great distance. A tempest brews outside, trapping her in the passageway. Afterward, the temple is visited by a group of Indians, as the manuscript predicted, and Unca Eliza hides in the secret passageway. While she is in there, she resolves to convert the Indians to Christianity (\\"from their idolatry\\") and develops a plan to hide within the body of the idol and to speak to the Indians when they arrive for their worship on the following year. An earthquake ensues during her practicing of the plan, and upon its conclusion, she discovers it has destroyed her abode. When the Indians arrive for their worship, she converses with the high-priest from within the idol, instructing the Indians in Christian principles. '''''' =Volume II=Chapter I By the end of Volume I, Unca has instructed the Indians to come back to visit her the following week for further instructions. She takes this time to reconsider what she had said to the Indians and how she should continue on with them. She also explored the island and discovered an extraordinary four footed animal. It was the size of a large dog, with long legs, a slender body, it had uncommonly large eyes which projected far from its head, and two rows of sharp but short teeth. This creature excited Unca's curiosity so she followed it. Other animals who were larger than it, fled at the sight of it. It came to a grassy area and extended itself as if dead, with eyes shut and lips closed. She sat down at some distance to watch it. The hair on his body was thick and long, five or six inches (152 mm), and formed bunches of clusters. A great number of field mice came up to him and began nibbling at the clusters of hair. It continued to lie still until a considerable number of mice had employed themselves among it. He then got up and shook violently, but the mice were stuck on him. He turned around, extended his long neck and began eating the mice greedily. In a few minutes he ate near three hundred of them because his body was almost covered in mice. Unca's curiosity was satisfied. Chapter II The day had come when the Indians were instructed to return to the island for further instructions. Unca took her place in the statue and waited. Only seven priest returned so she asked them why they did not bring their people? The high priest responded that it was their business to instruct their people after she has taught them. The priest explained that if she taught everyone, then they no longer had any means of employment. Unca told them that she will not teach them only and that they should not fear. She instructed the priest to go back and return with their people. He agreed and told her that they will return with their people in the morning because it will take up too much time in one day to complete this task. The next morning, the priest returned with a considerable number of people. She lectured for three hours and then told them to break for refreshments. She also instructed them to retire further from her so that she may emerge from the statue and take a refreshment for herself. She encouraged the people to ask her questions but they responded that \\"our priest know all, teach our priest and they will teach us\\". She concluded from this answer that the priest had instructed the people in private and then reminded everyone of what she had told them the previous day. Finishing her lecture, she told everyone that she had much more to teach them and that they should return once a week. The high priests being old should come if he pleased and all other could also choose to come if they wished. Unca excused the Indians and soon they all left the island. Chapter III Being suspicious of the priest because they would never suffer to be useless to their people, Unca decided that she must live among the Indians. Unca wished to make more progress with her teachings and it would be hard to do so from the statue once a week. It would also be inconvenient for them to come during the rainy season. She also considered her living arrangement. It would be hard for her to live underground during the summer and she would be confined to it also in the winter. After much thought she decided that it would be absolutely necessary to live with the Indians. She planned to introduce herself to the Indians but keep them ignorant of who she was and how she came to them so that she \\"might preserve a superiority over them\\". When the Indians returned to the island, she told them that they were ignorant of the true God and that God will send a holy woman to instruct them more fully. She told them to not be fearful or suspicious of that person who will be a woman. She will bring holy writings. They must respect her, do everything she commands, do not ask her where she comes from or when she is leaving, when she wishes to visit the island do not follow her or do anything that she forbids. Unca told them that she does not wish to force this woman upon them. They tell her to \\"Let her come! We will love and obey her!\\" She then instructed them to come back three days later, two hours after sunrise, and they will see the woman dressed like a high priest. After the Indians received her instructions and left, Unca began preparing for her departure. Chapter IV Unca rises early and begins preparing for the return of the Indians. She dresses herself in white and adorns herself in ornate jewelry of gold and precious stones. She leaves her shelter, locks it, and covers it up. Unca arrives at the statue and awaits the return of the Indians with her a staff, her bow and arrow, and a bundle of treasures. She also remembers to pray to God, that He might take away her fear and guide her on this grand task. The Indians arrive and the high-priest greets Unca respectfully. Unca announces her intentions: she will live with them for some time and instruct them on God's teachings, which she says will make them \\"happy for ever.\\" Unca does not fail to mention a set of rules which include the following: they must obey her orders, learn her teachings, and never ask where she came from, or when she is leaving. At this, the high- priest responds with bows of acceptance and gratitude but follows with a proposal that surprises Unca. Since their previous king had died recently and left no heirs, he asks Unca to take her place as their queen. She thanks him for the offer but declines saying she will be only their \\"instructor.\\" They all agree and Unca presents the high-priest and many of the people with rings from her treasures. A few of the Indians come forward and offer Unca some food and drink and Unca stands to say grace. This marks the beginning of her Christian teachings. She then mentions Jesus Christ and explains the Christian understanding that he is the son of God to whom they owe their thanks and praise. Chapter V Before embarking with the Indians, Unca prays to God. After the prayer, she sings a hymn in the Indian language to demonstrate the Christian ritual for the Indians. She leaves with the large group by canoe, and is welcomed in the Indian country where she is provided with lodging and 6 Indian servant girls. She is presented with gifts of liquor, dried meat, flowers, and fruit. Unca begins daily instruction for the priests on Scripture, and a weekly public instruction to spread the Christian faith. She reflects upon her surprise at the willingness and enthusiasm of the Indians to learn about Christianity. Unca also begins to translate her prayer books and the Bible from English into the Indian language. She admits that she is not happy living among the Indians, and that she knows she is perceived to be more than mortal and deliberately takes advantage of this. In her spare time, she shoots her bow and arrow, and revisits her old island. Two years pass living with the Indians, and Unca completes her translation of the Bible, the Catechism, and most of her Prayer Book. She is proud to have replaced the Indians religion of idolatry with Christianity. Chapter VI Returning on a regular trip to her island, Unca immediately perceives Europeans approaching the Idol. Concerned that they might try and enslave the Indians she ascends into the Oracle. Realizing that her cousin is among them she decides to speak to them through the Idol. Their discussion confirms that it is her cousin Winkfield and Unca assures him - via the Oracle's booming voice - that she is alive. She then asks them to sing a hymn her uncle wrote during which she sets up an Indian instrument to play through the Oracle's mouth and dresses herself in ceremonial robes. Unca sneaks up behind them and holds a sun staff in front of her face, slowly revealing herself, further terrifying the company in the process. While her cousin is relieved to see her alive, the rest of his company has been deeply disturbed by the loud speech of the Oracle, the music which Unca made it play, and her sudden appearance in luxurious robes. Unca tells her cousin that she will explain all these things in good time, but the company is so frightened by her that they are unable to speak. Chapter VII The company returns to their ship and Cousin Winkfield explains that the day after Unca was left on the island Captain Shore captured the vessel that she was on. The same Captain brought her cousin here to look for her, but now he is concerned the rest of the party has frightened the crew so much that she might not be able to get on board. Unca needs to leave for a while to settle things in her adopted home, but her cousin does not want her to leave at all. She insists and while she is waiting with her cousin and Captain Shore the crew members send a representative party to meet them. The party states that they are so terrified by Unca that they declare her to be the bride of Satan. Unca's cousin then agrees that she should return to her village and they make plans to meet on her island in the morning to set sail, which should give him time to calm down the crew. Chapter VIII As Unca leaves the sailors let out a shout for joy and she returns to the Idol to think about what has happened. She cries over her own folly and worries that her cousin might be murdered until she is exhausted and seeks some refreshment. Walking to her provisions she is immediately met by her cousin who tells her that they will not let him on board the ship. He assures her that Captain Shore will attempt to calm down his crew and will return in the morning to take them both on board. Unca and her cousin sit down to eat and he relates the fantastical claim of the crew: that they had seen her fly, filling the air with the smell of brimstone. Captain Shore challenged their claims saying that they are mutineers, but the crew insists that they are not, they just refuse to have the She-Devil or her friends on board. Unca and Winkfield decide to return to the island in the morning to see what Captain Shore has accomplished with his crew. Chapter IX Unca meets up with her canoe and tells the Indians - who had never seen a white man - that he is a relation of hers, which satisfies them. As they return to her village Unca tells her story to her cousin, who wishes to join her on her Christian mission. She discourages him and he proposes to her, which she delays answering as they have arrived on shore. They dine with the priests and return to her island in the morning. They spend most of the day on the island and are about to give up hope of seeing the ship when they find a note that Captain Shore has left for them. In it he states that the crew is resolute in their foolishness and the best he can do is leave Winkfield's effects on the shore and return for him with a new crew. This will take a year at least, but he will tell his family that both he and his cousin are alive, and when he returns he will leave them a means to signal his ship. Winkfield is happy because he can renew his suit of Unca, who only loves him as a friend and relation. She does consider that marriage would give them the chance to be alone together, as being alone with a man she is not married to hurts her modesty. Chapter X Winkfield's effects are taken to the village including some clothes for Unca for which she is very grateful. They also introduce chickens to the island along with a gun, telescope, and other goods, the result of which is to make the Indians as impressed with him as they are with Unca. Winkfield and Unca observe the sabbath and preach in English and the native dialect until Winkfield is fluent in the native language. Unca becomes so impressed with Winfkield that they are married within two months of his arrival and have both church and Indian ceremonies. The Indians are now baptized, married, and are \\"admitted to the Lord's supper.\\" At this point Unca asks her husband Winkfield how his arrival came about. Winkfield recounts how Captain Shore sought out audience with his father and related the story of her abandonment. Captain Shore tells them that he became a pirate out of need, but vowed not to kill anyone, and made his crew promise the same. They were about to simply rob Unca's ship when they saw her Indian servant hanging from the yard-arm and demanded that the captain explain himself. The Indian is taken down and he tells Shore the entire story of the captain's treachery and Unca's abandonment on the island. Chapter XI Shore continues to recount his story saying that he found Unca's effects on board the ship, but is resolved to make the captain confess. Shore threatens to hang the captain at the yard- arm upon which the captain immediately admits to everything. Shore is about to hang the captain when he has a religious epiphany and repents, resolving to change his ways, repair his past, and bring the captain to proper justice in England. The captain is restrained and Unca's wounded servants are attended to; the male servant dies within a few days, but the two female servants survive. Shore then tells his crew that he hopes to lead them to repent just as he led them to sin and they all agree not to be pirates anymore. He hopes that Winkfield Sr. will help them procure a pardon so that they may turn in the captain and start their lives anew. He also pledges that whoever can prove that he robbed them will have their stolen effects returned. Shore then asks if Winkfield Sr. will accept this proposal, if he will not, then Captain Shore will leave them unharmed. They agree to the plan and give Shore passage to France so that he may await his pardon in safety. Chapter XII Winkfield continues to relate the story to Unca, stating that they received the conditional pardon for Shore and brought the captain and his crew to justice. While Shore was preparing to return to his crew he spent a great deal of time with cousin Winkfield who had hoped to find the island where Unca was abandoned in the hopes of bringing her home or properly mourning her. Winkfield is given permission by his family to search for Unca and Captain Shore is glad to take him to the island he suspects Unca to be upon. Winkfield has thus filled in Unca on all that had happened between her abandonment and her discovery. Their life continues on the island with Winkfield returning to Unca's island every two weeks until he finds a cannon with which to signal Captain Shore's ship. Captain Shore then spends three days in their village, further updating them on events in England. The treacherous captain was brought to trial and hanged along with three of his crew-mates. Captain Shore delivered the pardon to his crew and spent time returning stolen goods to their original owners. Unca and Winkfield then tell Shore what they have been doing and Shore asks to join their village, which they consent to. They then return to Unca's island to collect the gold to pay for their needed purchases and destroy the Idol to prevent the Indians from worshiping it ever again. Winkfield and Shore then return to England to get the family's blessing and to bring back books and other needed items. Shore and Winkfield return to the island and Unca sends back her manuscript whose final passage states that none of them have any intention of returning to Europe ever again. Major themes=Female authority= Female authority is a major theme in The Female American. This is evident from the outset of the novel, beginning with the great power and political influence of the young princess in the Indian tribe. Also, despite the fact that the book follows the Robinsonade genre conventions, it explores the possibility of a female adventurer rather than a typically male one. Unca Eliza is a powerful and independent heroine who commands respect outside of the normal domestic setting. For instance, she displays her dominance in her numerous denials for marriage. In response to her cousin's persistent proposals, she contends: > \\"I would never marry any man who could not use a bow and arrow as well as I > could; but as he still continued his suit, I always laughed at him, and > answered in the Indian language, of which he was entirely ignorant; and so > by degrees wearied him into silence on that head\\" (51). This also exemplifies Unca Eliza's superior worldliness, and her ability to compete on an equal level with her male counterparts. What complicates this theme is that Unca Eliza, though solitary on the deserted island, is aided in survival by the experiences and manuscript of a male character. However, it is ultimately Unca Eliza's decision to trust in God, and the ingenuity of her endeavor to convert the Indians to Christianity, that provide her with a successful way off the island. However, even with this authority, Unca Eliza, does conform, at the end of the novel, to what is expected of her. She marries. Even when her cousin has not accomplished the task of mastering the bow and arrow. It seems this event is the author's attempt of satisfying the readers of the day. They would expect the woman to marry because isn't that what every 18th century woman strives for? For Unca Eliza the marriage serves more as a way to have companionship. She does not lose her independence and works beside her husband instead of under him. This may not be considered authority but equality. = Performance and gender roles = When Unca decides to convert the Indians to Christianity the use of performance is important to note because the reader can visually see how Unca uses the body of a male cleric to promote her ability as a female missionary, a role usually designated to men. Before Unca‚Äôs performance, she describes the sun idol saying that, ‚ÄúThe image itself, of gold, greatly exceeded human size: it resembled a man clad in a long rob or vest‚Äù (Winkfield 86). Kristianne Vaccaro is surely right in reference to this part when she says ‚Äúwhat is most significant about the text‚Äôs‚Äîand, ultimately, about Unca‚Äôs‚Äîperformance of these religious ‚Äútruths‚Äù is that she herself cannot access them without first playing the role of male cleric‚Äù (Vaccaro 136). Unca uses the body of the sun idol to instill religious truths because she herself would not be able to do so as a female. Once the performance begins, the reader can clearly see how Unca has used the body of the sun idol to perform her duty as a female missionary. She narrates that ‚ÄúHigh-Priest. Did God send you to teach us? Answer. He brought me hear, and I will teach you.‚Äù (Winkfield 104). Unca has successfully convinced the Indians of her religious truths and has used the sun idol to her aid in establishing her authority not only over the Indians but the reader as well. Unca no longer refers to herself as Unca but ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù signaling that the reader can now take all that she says for truth because she has successfully transformed into her role as a female missionary. This performance was necessary because Unca could not assert her authority without first performing a role she was not physically in reality; the role of a male cleric. Unca‚Äôs performance allows her to move through genders fluidly and assert her authority as a female missionary to both the Indians and the reader. While this performance does help Unca to establish authority in this instance, the loss of Unca's voice towards the end of her narrative complicates her position as both a female authority figure and missionary. The Female American is no longer in the voice of Unca but ‚Äúwe‚Äù as she succumbs to marrying her white European cousin, they narrate ‚Äú As we never intended to have any more to do with Europe, captain Shore and my husband ordered the ship, by whom, for my father and mother‚Äôs satisfaction, I sent over these adventures‚Äù (Winkfield 162). Unca has become a ‚Äúwe‚Äù, much different from her previous position as the ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù showing that once her cousin came back, societal gender roles were put back into play and it did not matter what Unca did to try and assert herself. She even changes her ‚Äúhistory‚Äù into ‚Äúadventures‚Äù because it is no longer a history about her life but her helping her husband, the missionary, in this new world. Unca may seem to be a trailblazer at the beginning of her narrative but only exposes herself to be a pawn used to ‚Äúkeep intact the social hierarchies from which [she] arises‚Äù (Vaccaro 150). =Imperialism and religious conversion= Unca's faith in God and her desire to convert the Indians to Christianity prompt her to speak forth from the Idol as a type of \\"Queen\\" or female \\"God.\\" This raises the issue of capitalist accumulation, colonial conquest, and political imperialism which many theorists have associated with Defoe's novel, Robinson Crusoe. There are several situations and events in the novel which portray Unca's relation to this theory. After Unca first speaks to the Indians through the masking of the Idol, she is uncertain whether she had done an evil act. Although she does affirm that Idol Worship is contrary to Christian doctrine, but she bravely used this same idol to dispel a belief in false gods. Then speaking through this idol, she revealed her true intent, and through her diligence, she converts the natives to Christianity. > \\"I heartily repented that I had ever spoken to them... Thus I was distracted > whether I determined to stay, or go; to stay was attended with certain > evils; to go, too probably, with very great ones. Miserable wretch! cried I, > what shall I do? tears succeeded; and I could think no more, with any > coherence\\" (110). While she is unsure of the morality of her decision to speak to them as a God, she still goes on to enforce her superiority over them: > \\"[B]y keeping them ignorant of who I was, or how I came to them, I might > preserve a superiority over them, sufficient to keep them in awe, and to > excite their obedience: yet I determined to speak no untruth\\" (110). Unca's desire to \\"preserve a superiority over them\\" stems from an even deep- seated fear and an increased longing for protection and safety. To her, God is a powerful force, yet in a moment of despair, He is not her savior. Unca turns to a statue, a false idol, to give her protection from the unknown and in an attempt to preserve her life, she readily embraces this new found \\"superiority\\" and power over the Indians. She does however, retain her dignity by remaining truthful throughout her conversations with the Indians. The fact that she had slaves who \\"begged\\" to go with her on her travels is yet another incident which can be seen as Capitalist Accumulation. And relating her strategies with those of Robinson Crusoe's, hers seem more manipulative than severe. She does have two weapons: a knife and a bow and arrow. However, she only uses them (the knife) when absolutely necessary. Early in the novel there is another scene that discusses imperialism. In this scene, Unca's father is reflecting on a conversation he once had with his elder brother, who was a clergyman. His brother clearly disagrees with imperialism and tries to dissuade Unca's father from invading other countries: \\"We have no right to invade the country of another, and I fear invaders will always meet a curse; but as your youth disenables you from viewing this expedition in that equitable light that it ought to be looked on, may your sufferings be portionably light! for our God is just, and will weigh our actions in a just scale\\" (37). Even though Unca's father had this dramatic warning from his brother, he still goes on to try and conquer foreign countries. His brother even tries to infuse guilt into his speech, but it still does not register with Unca's father. Unca's father's attitude is clearly reflected in Unca when she uses the idol statue to convert the Indians. Historical relevance Unca Eliza Winkfield's grandfather is said to be Edward Wingfield, the first President of the Virginia colony. Winkfield was dismissed as president when the Colony of Virginia fell under a harsh food shortage, which in turn caused many internal political disputes about Winkfield's ability to successfully govern Virginia. His immediate predecessors were John Ratcliffe and then the famous John Smith. After being expunged from his presidential duties, Edward Winkfield wrote a famous text by the name of \\"Discourse on Virginia.\\" In this text he speaks of his true passions, his resentment of being asked to leave, future plans that he had for Virginia, outlooks on Virginian society in general and the faults of Virginia that could possibly lead to its Demise.

When that country achieved independence, all other members of her family chose to claim British citizenship and either return to the UK or migrate to other countries. May Agnes was the only member of her family to move to India. She married Mr. D'Souza, an Indian Christian from Goa, which was in those days a Portuguese territory. The couple settled in the neighbourhood of Byculla in Mumbai, or Bombay as it was then known. It was in the same house in Byculla that Banker grew up, under the care of his grandmother.

His refusal to identify himself as belonging to a caste, religion or community caused many conflicts during his childhood, since it was at odds with India's traditional caste-based social structure. This culture of segregation and systematic bias turned him away from his estranged biological father's religion Hinduism, and Banker grew up with little or no exposure to Hindu culture, religion or literature. He identified himself with other minorities and his closest friends were Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Jews. He took Persian and Urdu lessons for a time and even won a college-level prize for Urdu-Translation in collaboration with a Pakistani friend.

Three of his early novels to be published were crime thrillers, claimed to be the first written by an Indian novelist in English. They gained him widespread attention and still continue to be regarded with critical approval. Most recently, literary critic Zac O'Yeah wrote: \\"Slimmer and much more hard-boiled are three striking crime novels written by Ashok Banker many years ago. I still remember reading The Iron Bra, a blood-soaked story of a female investigator, Sheila Ray, whose finger rests lightly on the trigger as she defends her family‚Äôs reputation and takes on gangsters in a particularly unforgettable shootout. The growing city‚Äôs construction sites were a crucial component in the tight plot. Tragically, my own copy is long lost and second-hand copies cost $129 (approx. Rs6,000) plus shipping on an online bookshop, so it looks like it‚Äôs high time to have this gem of a crime novel reissued in an omnibus edition along with Banker‚Äôs Ten Dead Admen and Murder & Champagne (all three originally published in 1993).\\"\\"Murder in the city\\" Article on Indian Crime Fiction at Livemint, Wall Street Journal India website. His Kali Rising is a contemporary radical feminist thriller series featuring only women protagonists. The first book, Blood Red Sari, was launched at the Tata Literature Live! literary festival in Mumbai in November 2012. =Science fiction, fantasy and horror= The stories of his \\"Devi\\" series are short works featuring Avatars of the Hindu goddess Devi, and have appeared in various science fiction, fantasy, and horror magazines. Several of these genre publications have claimed that his was the first speculative fiction by an Indian author writing in English to be published. Due to his early association with the scifi genres, his work is often found on several recommended reading lists and discussed in seminars, conventions, essays and books. His Gods of War was released by Penguin in 2009. But it was his recasting of Indian mythology in the mould of \\"western-style fantasy\\" that got him international attention and made him an important addition to the history of post- Independence literature. =Autobiographical work= Three of his novels contain autobiographical elements and are closely related to one another. His first novel (though the fifth published) Vertigo is about a man struggling to make a successful career and home life in Bombay (the former name of Mumbai). Byculla Boy takes its name from the Byculla suburb of Bombay where he and his mother grew up. Beautiful Ugly and the complementary documentary of the same title are a tribute to his mother, portraying the tragic events of her life.My mother and I: An intensely personal note by Ashok Banker on his film project Beautiful Ugly (Expanded and Revised by Ashok on 22 June) =Mythological retellings= Banker is best known for his Ramayana Series, a freely imaginative retelling of the ancient Sanskrit epic poem. The series is ranked at No.1 on the \\"Internet Book List\\".\\"Internet Book List\\" : Internet Book List website. The eight-book Series was published in 56 countries and 7 languages to considerable critical acclaim. In India, the Series continues to enjoy popularity and sales. It is often credited with being either directly or largely responsible for the current resurgence of interest in mythology. It has been called \\"super-cool\\" (The Hindu), \\"a milestone\\" (India Today) and \\"a magnificent labor of love\\" (Outlook) and appeared on most major recommended reading lists during its publication.

He has been credited as the author of the first ebook by an Indian author, the first online serial novel, the first multimedia novel, and numerous other early experiments with digital publishing.

The Imperial Bank of India (IBI) was one of the oldest and the largest commercial bank of the Indian subcontinent, and was subsequently transformed into the State Bank of India in 1955. Initially, as per its royal charter, it acted as the central bank for British India prior to the formation of the Reserve Bank of India in 1950. Origin The Imperial Bank of India came into existence on 27 January 1921 through the reorganisation and amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks of colonial India into a single banking entity. The decision of his majesty's government was certainly influenced by the 1912 book \\"Indian Currency and Finance\\" authored by John Maynard Keynes.https://www.jstor.org/stable/2222811?seq=1 The Presidency Banks were the Bank of Bengal, established on 2 June 1806, the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840), and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). The Imperial Bank was 80% privately owned while the rest were owned by the state. Activities The Imperial Bank of India performed all the normal functions which a commercial bank was expected to perform. In the absence of any central banking institution in India until 1935, the Imperial Bank of India also performed a number of functions which are normally carried out by a central bank. Milestones *In 1924, at Apollo Street, currently called Mumbai Samachar Marg, Mumbai, a magnificent stone structure with fretted windows, was constructed to house a branch of the Imperial Bank of India. * In 1933, Sir Badridas Goenka, an important public figure and business tycoon of his time, and a prominent member of Marwari community of Calcutta, became the first Indian to be appointed as the Chairman of the Imperial Bank of India. Epilogue The Reserve Bank of India, which is the central bank of India, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, which was renamed on 30 April 1955 to the State Bank of India. This transformation from the Imperial Bank of India to the State Bank of India was given legal recognition through an Act of the Parliament of India, which came into force from 1 July 1955. On that day, the bank had 480 branches and sub-offices, as well as three local head offices; slightly more than a quarter of the resources of the Indian banking industry was under its control and command. The branch network of the State Bank of India has since grown to 24,050 branches as of 31 March 2018. In 2007, the Reserve Bank of India transferred its stake in the State Bank of India to the Indian Government.

Marie Jos√®phe was the mother of three kings of France, including Louis XVI, as well as Madame √âlisabeth. Childhood Maria Josepha was born on 4 November 1731 in Dresden Castle to Augustus III, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and Maria Josepha of Austria. Maria Josepha was the ninth of sixteen children and the fifth daughter. Dauphin Louis, eldest son of King Louis XV of France, was widowed on 22 July 1746 when his wife, Infanta Maria Teresa, died giving birth to their only child, a daughter named after herself. King Ferdinand VI of Spain, Maria Teresa's half-brother, had offered the Dauphin another sister, Infanta Maria Antonia. Instead, the King of France and his all-powerful mistress Madame de Pompadour wanted to open up diplomatic channels. The marriage between Maria Josepha and the Dauphin had first been suggested by her uncle Maurice de Saxe. Louis XV and his mistress were convinced that the marriage would be advantageous to French foreign affairs. France and Saxony had been on opposing sides in the recent War of the Austrian Succession and thus the marriage between the Saxon princess and the Dauphin would form a new alliance between the two nations. There was one problem with the suggested bride: Maria Josepha's grandfather Augustus II of Poland had deposed Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski from the Polish throne. Leszczy≈Ñski was the father of Maria Leszczy≈Ñska, Louis XV's wife and mother of the Dauphin. The marriage was said to have humiliated the simple-living Queen, even though she and Maria Josepha would later get on well. Other proposals came from Savoy in the form of Princess Eleonora of Savoy or her sister Maria Luisa of Savoy. Both were refused. Despite the disapproval of the Queen, Maria Josepha married the Dauphin on 9 February 1747.  Dauphine  Portrait by Jean Marc Nattier, 1751 Prior to the marriage, tradition demanded that the bride wear a bracelet which had a picture of her father on it; the Queen seeing the Dauphine asked to see the bracelet. The witty Maria Josepha then revealing the bracelet to the Queen showed a portrait of the Queen's father. The Dauphine said that the portrait represented the fact that the Duke of Lorraine was Maria Josepha's grandfather by marriage. The Queen and the court were strongly impressed by the tact of this girl of 15 years. The Dauphine was also very close to her father-in-law Louis XV. At the time of the marriage, the Dauphin was still grieving for his Spanish wife. This grief was very public on the part of the Dauphin but Maria Josepha was praised greatly for her conquering the heart of the Dauphin \\"bit by bit\\". Despite Maria Josepha being the patient wife, the Dauphin's grief worsened in April 1748 when his only child with the Infanta died at the age of two. The Dauphin was deeply affected by the child's death. Maria Josepha later commissioned a painting (now lost) of her stepdaughter to be left over her cradle.MARIE-TH√âR√àSE, FILLE A√éN√âE DU DAUPHIN LOUIS-FERDINAND The new Dauphine was very grateful to Madame de Pompadour for helping arrange her marriage, and always maintained a good relationship with the royal mistress. Like her husband, Maria Josepha was very devout. Together with her mother-in-law, she formed a counterbalance to the libertine behaviour of her father-in-law and his court. The couple were not fond of the various entertainments held at Versailles every week, preferring to stay in their apartments which can still be seen on the ground floor of Versailles overlooking the Orangerie. The couple's first child was a daughter, born in 1750 on the feast day of Saint Zephyrinus and named Marie Z√©phyrine. The birth was greeted with much joy by her parents even though Louis XV had been disappointed the child was not a male. She died in 1755.Spawfourth. Tony, Versailles, New York, 2008, p.200-1 Their second child, Louis, was born on 15 September 1751. The royal couple concentrated so much time and energy on their eldest son that their other children suffered from neglect. He died on 22 March 1761 after having fallen from a toy horse. He started limping and a tumour began to grow on his hip. This was operated on, but he never recovered the use of his legs. The couple's second son, Xavier, was born in 1753, and died a year later. As a result, their third son, Louis Auguste, born on 23 August 1754, became second in line to the French throne after his father. Thanks to Maria Josepha's close relationship with the King and the Dauphin, the relationship between father and son was soon repaired. The Dauphin was at the center of the D√©vots, a group of religious-minded men who hoped to gain power when he succeeded to the throne. They were against the way Louis XV openly had affairs at court in blatant view of the Queen. Naturally they were not popular with Louis XV. Her father-in-law named his loving daughter-in-law la triste Pepa; in 1756, Frederick II of Prussia invaded her native Saxony and that started the Seven Years' War, which France later joined. Politically reserved, she exerted herself only once, in 1762, in vain, for the preservation of the Society of Jesus in France. The Society had been dissolved by order of the Parlement of Paris, inspired by Jansenist magistrates, against the will of the King. Later life The death of her husband, on 20 December 1765, dealt Maria Josepha a devastating blow from which she never recovered, sinking into a deep depression which lasted till her own death 15 months later. To save her the torment of remaining with memories of her dead husband, Louis XV re-arranged the allocation of apartments within Versailles, so that Maria Josepha moved out of the apartments that she had shared with her husband and into the apartments of Madame de Pompadour, who had died in 1764. There, the king visited her more than he had in the past, paid her many kind attentions, and discussed with her the possible wedding of her son, the new dauphin. Maria Josepha was not pleased with the idea of her eldest son marrying a daughter of Maria Theresa of Austria, in whose favour Maria Josepha's own mother (a cousin of Maria Theresa) had been disinherited. Soon, Maria Josepha's health declined. She died on 13 March 1767 of tuberculosis, and was buried in the Cathedral of Saint-√âtienne in Sens. The marriage of her son, the future Louis XVl, with Maria Theresa's daughter Marie Antoinette was celebrated three years later.

It has 25,726 inhabitants, a city situated on the northern coast of Alagoas state, Brazil, being the easternmost city of that state. As the main destination in the State of Alagoas after its capital city, Maragogi attracts visitors from Macei√≥. From Japaratinga beach, on the southern tip, a ferryboat crosses Manguaba River into Porto das Pedras, where visitors find virtually deserted beaches. Maragogi was initially a small village called Gamela. In 1887, it was granted the status of an adopted the name of Isabel, to honor the Brazilian Princess who signed a law ending slavery in Brazil. Later on, in 1892, it was named as Maragogi after the river that baths the city. \\"Maragogi\\", according to some historians, comes from ‚ÄúMarahub-gy‚Äù, or river of the Marauba tribes. Geography=Climate= Maragogi has a typical tropical climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and trade winds blowing from the ocean. January is the warmest month, with mean maxima of 31 ¬∞C and minima of 22 ¬∞C and more sun; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with means of 26 ¬∞C and 17 ¬∞C and more rain. =Vegetation= Maragogi has a tropical forest. Rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 2,000 mm (about 78 inches or 2 meters) and 1700 mm (about 67 inches). The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients. There are several common characteristics of tropical rainforest trees. Tropical rainforest species frequently possess one or more of the following attributes not commonly seen in trees of higher latitudes or trees in drier conditions on the same latitude. Demographics The Zona da Mata in Alagoas State. High population density. As of the census of 2007, the population was 25,726 hab. =Maragogi Ethnic Groups= According to the 2007 census, the racial makeup of the city was: *Majority White and Multiracial. *Minority Black. =Maragogi Demographics History= 1\\\\. Amerindians, Brazil's indigenous population, came from human groups that migrated from Siberia across the Bering Strait around 9000 BC. 2\\\\. Portuguese colonists and settlers, arriving from 1500 onward. 3\\\\. Diverse groups of immigrants from Europe arriving in Maragogi during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. And now, because of tourism. 4\\\\. African slaves brought to the country from 1530 until the end of the slave trade in 1850. Economy=Tourism= Maragogi is located on the Coral Coast ‚Äì Costa dos Corais ‚Äì 130 kilometers of continuous living tropical reefs on the coast of Northeast Brazil. The municipality is the second most visited city after Maceio the state capital of Alagoas. Its major attraction is the \\"Gal√©s\\", a group of tropical pools formed at low tide about 6 kilometers from the city's beach. They are served by 15 large registered catamarans leaving from various points in the municipal area. Individual tours are also available. In 2015 the city started to host sports events, with the launching of the first Trail Running competition on the region: the WINGSMAN Maragogi and then started to become the destination for adventure and outdoors tourism along with the traditional tourist looking for the best beaches in the country. Maragogi's history includes the battles between Dutch and Portuguese colonizers as well as the growth of the sugar cane and coconut plantations that formed the first wealth of the region. Today, it is tourism that provides the most important economic impact in the region. But, its potential remains unexplored. Even so, the busy waterfront in the City of Maragogi has a variety of restaurants, stores and stalls selling local arts and crafts. Trips to snorkel or scuba dive the reefs can be interspersed by excursions on the reefs themselves or a sail (or even fish) on the local \\"jangada\\" sailing rafts. The deserted beaches of Maragogi and other rural attractions can be accessed by renting beach buggies readily available at the hotels and pousadas. = Places of interest = Tourism office at Maragogi Beach  Maragogi Beach  Beaches in Maragogi have calm waters, without strong waves, with coral reefs and fine sands. During low tide, sand banks emerge forming natural pools, known as Croas (5 km away from the coast) and Gal√©s (6 km away). \\"Jangadas\\" and boats can take tourists to these pools. On the beach's southern tip, between Vila de Japaratinga and Pontal, visitors find the less urbanized beaches with 20-m high sea cliffs. Visitors can also go on a boat ride to coral reefs 6 km away from the coast. Maragogi beach is near Maragogi River, with calm waves, flat sands and coral reefs.

He is the older brother of major league catchers Jos√© Molina and Yadier Molina. Initially regarded as a \\"good glove, no hit\\" catcher with a strong arm and an exceptional ball blocker, Molina won a Gold Glove as the top defensive player at his position in consecutive seasons in and . But he also developed into a very good contact hitter and free-swinging power hitter. Between 2000 and 2007, he struck out just 331 times, and in 2000 led the American League in average at-bats between strikeouts, with 14.3. He is the only player in history to hit a home run and not get credit for the run. He was regarded as one of the slowest baserunners of his day. Bengie currently provides color commentary on the Spanish language radio broadcast for the St. Louis Cardinals. High school and college Molina graduated from Maestro Lad√≠ High School with honors in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, and played shortstop for Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona, in 1991 and 1992. Angels in . Professional career=Anaheim Angels/Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (1998-2005)= Molina entered the major leagues by playing two games for the Anaheim Angels in , and a handful of games in . He became the Angels' regular catcher in 2000 and remained so through the season. Over his last few seasons with the Angels, his backup as catcher was his brother, Jos√© Molina. Molina got his first championship ring in 2002 after the Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in seven games in the 2002 World Series. =Toronto Blue Jays (2006)= Molina's contract with the Angels expired after the 2005 season, and the team decided not pursue him because of the salary he would demand. He signed a 1-year $5 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a mutual option for a second year. After signing with the Blue Jays, Molina expressed his anger at the Angels over how he parted company with them. \\"The way they let me go without a notice, without calling me, that said a lot,\\" Molina said. \\"That's what really hurts me. I think I built a good relationship with them,\\" he said. \\"They never let me know. They just threw me like a piece of trash.\\" Molina's agent, Alan Nero, later confirmed however, that both he and Molina had in fact received calls from the Angels informing them of the team's decisions. Nero suggested that Molina's comments were born of his disappointment that he was not retained by the Angels. While Molina was expected to catch most of the Jays' season with Gregg Zaun serving as his backup, his difficulties with right-handed pitchers led the Jays to use a platoon system. =San Francisco Giants (2007‚Äì2010)= After the 2006 season, Molina became a free agent and signed a three-year, $16 million deal with the San Francisco Giants. Molina hit his 100th home run on September 5, 2007, off Jorge Julio in the sixth inning of a 5‚Äì3 victory against the Colorado Rockies. Brothers Bengie and Yadier Molina Molina was announced as the Willie Mac Award winner for 2007 (for spirit and leadership) in a pregame ceremony on September 21, 2007. He got the most out of 1,617 votes from the fans. Later in that September 21 game, Molina knocked in career RBI number 500 in the bottom of the first on a single that scored Dave Roberts. They lost the game to the Cincinnati Reds 9‚Äì8 in 11 innings. In 2007, Molina walked only 2.9% of the time, the lowest percentage in the NL. On September 26, 2008, Molina became the first player in MLB history to hit a home run and not get credit for a run scored. In the 6th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit a ball off the right field wall at AT&T; Park which the umpire called in fair play, and wound up at first base. Emmanuel Burriss immediately ran out to first base to pinch run for Molina before anyone else could intervene, as Giants manager Bruce Bochy discussed the matter with the umpires. However, the umpires used instant replay and subsequently ruled the hit a home run, but refused Bochy the opportunity to reinsert Molina into the game. San Francisco continued the game under protest, but won 6‚Äì5 in the 10th inning. Preceding the same game, Molina had received the Willie Mac Award for the second year in a row. In 2009, he led the majors in sacrifice flies (with 11), and walked in only 2.5% of his plate appearances, the lowest percentage in majors for those with qualifying plate appearances. On January 19, 2010, Molina re-signed a 1-year $4.5 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. =Texas Rangers (2010)= Following one of the Giants' longer losing streaks of the season, and the sudden emergence of rookie catcher Buster Posey, Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers on June 30, 2010, for relief pitcher Chris Ray and a player to be named later, which was minor league RHP Michael Main. As two of the Giants' best pitchers commented upon Molina's departure, his contributions to the Giants were very significant. \\"He helped me mature and succeed. I've said time and time again that he deserves half of those awards that I've gotten,\\" said Tim Lincecum, the reigning two-time National League Cy Young Award winner. \\"The things he's done for me ‚Äì for calling a game, to give me confidence throwing different pitches in different counts ‚Äì really, really, really benefited me,\\" Matt Cain said of Molina. Notorious for his lack of baserunning ability, on July 16, 2010, Molina hit for the cycle against Boston. He had (in order) a single, double, home run (grand slam), and triple. He was then pinch run for and left the game in the top of the 8th inning after hitting the triple, with a leg injury. He is the fifth Texas Ranger to hit for the cycle. He is also the first catcher in MLB history to hit a grand slam and hit for the cycle in the same game. During the 2010 American League Division Series Molina (again despite his poor baserunning ability) stole a base in Game 5, his first in over four years. He also hit a home run in Game 1. In Game 4 of the 2010 American League Championship Series, with 2 outs in the 6th inning and the Rangers trailing the New York Yankees, 3‚Äì2, Molina hit a three- run home run off A. J. Burnett. The home run, arguably one of the most important in Rangers history, proved to be the game-winner for the Rangers and gave the underdog Rangers a commanding 3‚Äì1 lead in the series. The Rangers won the ALCS against the Yankees in six games, which allowed the Rangers to enter the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Since the Texas Rangers made it to the World Series, along with the San Francisco Giants, Molina became the sixth player to play for the two World Series teams in the same season. Due to having played for both Giants and Rangers during the 2010 season, Molina was guaranteed to receive a World Series ring regardless of whether his current or former team won the World Series. In the 2010 World Series, Molina batted only .182 with one RBI. The Rangers eventually lost the World Series to the Giants in five games. After the season was over, Molina was released as a free agent. Molina spent most of the 2011 season on free agency and eventually retired. Coaching career Molina as a Rangers coach (2014) =St. Louis Cardinals (2013)= After his retirement, Molina accepted the Cardinals' offer on December 14, 2012 to be their assistant hitting coach to John Mabry. =Texas Rangers= Molina joined the Rangers' coaching staff for the 2014 season as their first base coach and catching instructor.

It belongs to the true woodcreepers (tribe Dendrocolaptini) of the ovenbird family (Furnariidae). It is the only member of the genus Sittasomus, but includes 15 vocally and morphologically distinct subspecies in 5 groups, some of which are candidates for a future split. Description and Ecology This small woodcreeper is a slender bird, typically long, and weighing . The head, upper back and underparts are lighter or darker greyish olive, and the wings, tail and lower back are light rufous. The bill is short and thin. The normal call is a fast, high-pitched trill wu- wu-wu-we-we-we-we-ee-ee-ee-ee-we-we-we-we, but this varies geographically. It breeds from southern Mexico through tropical Central and South America to northern Argentina and Uruguay, and also on Tobago. The species is found throughout the Amazon basin, but is absent from its lowest reaches, including much of the adjacent Guyanas. There, the subspecies of the northeastern Amazon (S. g. axillaris) ranges at least to the Pakaraima Mountains, where it is fairly common at ASL, descending to about ASL on occasion. The olivaceous woodcreeper has also been recorded from extreme southern Guyana and the Essequibo River (which may be its eastern limit in the region). It is apparently completely absent from eastern Guyana eastwards through Suriname and French Guiana. In Uruguay, the olivaceous woodcreeper was found for the first time in 1997 in the gallery forests of the Yaguar√≥n River, in Cerro Largo Department. Since then, it has also been recorded near Cuchilla de Mangrullo, as well as in the Sierra de los R√≠os. The olivaceous woodcreeper is a common and widespread bird of forests and other woodlands. It feeds on insects and spiders. It normally forages on tree trunks or large branches or on the ground, usually singly. These birds may associate with foraging groups of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) to snatch prey startled by the monkeys. They can also be occasionally seen catching flying prey like termites in mid-air, and will sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks. In some places (e.g. in the Serra de Paranapiacaba of Brazil), they may even form a core species of such flocks. It builds a nest lined with dead leaves in a tree hole and lays three white eggs. Due to its extremely wide range, the olivaceous woodcreeper is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

He was the Boies Professor of United States History at the University of Pennsylvania. Early life Hackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1933, and educated in the Birmingham public school system. He was a graduate of Ramsay High School. After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years. Career Hackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975. From 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976. Hackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993. He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton. His defining initiative in the job was his first: \\"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997. Hackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement and the 1960s. Among the articles and books on history that Hackney published, Populism to Progressivism in Alabama won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association. Dixie Redux: Essays in Honor of Sheldon Hackney, an edited collection of essays authored by his former students and collaborators will be released in November 2013. Hackney was credited at the University of Pennsylvania with raising undergraduate minority enrollment from 13 to 30 percent and with increasing the endowment from about $160 million to $1 billion. Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called Water buffalo incident, a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation, The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War , was published in 2002. During his confirmation, critics derided him as the \\"pope of political correctness.\\" \\"I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan\\", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. \\"I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well.\\" He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney. Personal life and death Hackney was the son-in-law of Virginia and Clifford Durr. Hackney died at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79. He had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

He played for four teams in MLB, and for the Puerto Rican national team in the World Baseball Classic (WBC). Noted for his abilities in pitch-framing and in handling pitching staffs, Molina is a two-time World Series champion in MLB and a two-time silver medalist with Puerto Rico. Molina is the middle of three brothers (older brother Bengie and younger brother Yadier), all of whom have played catcher in Major League Baseball. They are the only three brothers in MLB history to all win World Series rings. Bengie and Jos√© did it together as members of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, and Yadier with the 2006 and 2011 Cardinals. Jos√© later won a second ring with the 2009 New York Yankees. Personal life Molina graduated from Maestro Ladi High School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico in 1993, and attended Ladislao Martinez High School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. Professional baseball career=Chicago Cubs= Molina was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of the 1993 amateur draft. His first major league team was the Cubs, for which he played 10 games as a September callup in 1999. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= He joined the then-Anaheim Angels in 2001 as a free agent, but played only a handful of games before establishing himself during the 2002 season as the Angels backup catcher for his brother, Bengie. In 2002, Molina got his first World Series ring as the Angels won the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants. In 2005, he hit a career-best six home runs, and tied his career-high with 25 RBI, as he hit .306 against lefties. Following Bengie's departure from the Angels, Molina entered the 2006 season as the Angels' new starting catcher, though it was expected that rookie Jeff Mathis would also see substantial time handling the team's catching duties over the course of the season. However, Mathis struggled during the first month of the season and, as a result, he was ultimately demoted to the minor leagues. Molina himself then struggled offensively, and the promising offensive performance of Mathis' replacement on the roster, rookie Mike Napoli, once again relegated Molina to the role of backup catcher. Still, he played in a career-high 78 games and had a career-best 225 at-bats in 2006. =New York Yankees= Molina with the New York Yankees in 2007 On July 21, 2007, Molina was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Jeff Kennard. At the time of the trade, he had a .237 lifetime batting average, but had hit lefties much better (.269). He would go on to hit .318 for the Yankees with 1 home run. On December 3, 2007, the Yankees signed Molina to a two-year deal. He served as the team's starting catcher following a shoulder injury to Jorge Posada, but returned to the backup role when the Yankees acquired Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez. Molina was successful in eight of nine sacrifice bunt attempts in 2008. On September 21, 2008, Molina hit the last home run in the original Yankee Stadium, in the Yankees' final game at the ballpark, which was against the Baltimore Orioles. Following this event, Molina expressed satisfaction at being the final answer to the question presented by Babe Ruth in his last public speech at the facility, which closed by stating, \\"I was glad to have hit the first home run in this park. God only knows who will hit the last.\\" Controversy emerged around the home run ball hit by Molina in a dispute regarding ownership involving fans and Yankee Stadium security. Later in 2008, the ball would come to auction, where it was estimated by auctioneer Guernsey's at $200,000-$300,000. ESPN stated \\"[the ball] was expected to fetch up to $400,000, but was pulled after offers fell short of the suggested opening bid of $100,000.\\" and blamed the economic crisis of 2008. In 2009, Molina again served as the Yankees' primary backup catcher, catching most of A. J. Burnett's games when possible and hitting .219 in 138 at bats (52 games). On October 29, 2009 in Game two of the 2009 World Series, he picked off Jayson Werth at first base becoming the first Yankees catcher to pick a baserunner off in the World Series since Yogi Berra who did the same in the 1950 World Series, also against the Philadelphia Phillies. Molina got his second World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Phillies in the 2009 World Series in 6 games. =Toronto Blue Jays= On February 19, 2010, Molina signed a one-year contract that included an option for 2011 with the Toronto Blue Jays. He had one of his best offensive seasons in 2010, producing a .681 OPS with 6 home runs over 57 games. Molina returned to the Blue Jays for the 2011 season, providing veteran guidance to rookie J. P. Arencibia. The club picked up his option for $1.2 million. In a rarely seen lineup move, Molina was named the designated hitter on May 27, 2011 against the White Sox. In addition to getting three hits off Mark Buehrle, Molina and Rajai Davis executed a double steal; this was only Molina's 11th stolen base in his 12-year career. =Tampa Bay Rays= On November 28, 2011, Molina signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. After posting a .223 average with 8 home runs and 32 RBI, Molina's 2013 contract option for $1.8 million was picked up by the Rays. On December 2, 2013, after another season with Tampa Bay in which he hit .233 with 2 home runs and 18 RBI, Molina signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Rays. Molina was released on November 24, 2014. =Coaching career= On November 6, 2015, Molina was hired as the minor league catching coordinator for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to work with catchers in their farm system. Defense Blue Jays In the minors, Molina was rated as the best defensive catcher in the Pacific Coast League by Baseball America in 2002. In his years with the Cubs and Angels, he displayed better than average range as a catcher, and also played 9 games at first base. In 2004, he threw out 22 of 45 base stealers (48.89%), tops in the AL (minimum of 40 attempts). He also led AL catchers with five pickoffs in 2004, despite only 57 starts. In 2005, he caught more than half of those who attempted to steal against him, again the best percentage in the AL. In 2008, he again played excellent defense, and displayed his excellent arm, replacing the injured Jorge Posada. In a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 25, 2010, Molina set a Blue Jays club record by throwing out four attempted basestealers in one game, including defending American League basestealing champion Carl Crawford, who was thrown out twice. This was the first time an AL catcher had caught four basestealers in one game since Terry Steinbach in 1992. World Baseball Classic Molina earned a silver medal as a backup catcher to his brother Yadier on the Puerto Rican team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

His father, who died in 1990, was a photographer. Erickson had a stutter which was more pronounced when he was child, and teachers believed he couldn't read. This motif occasionally has recurred in novels such as Amnesiascope. Erickson studied film at UCLA (BA, 1972), then journalism (M.A. 1973). For a few years he worked as a freelance writer for alternative weekly newspapers. His first novel, Days Between Stations, was published in 1985. Along with two non-fiction books, Leap Year and American Nomad, Erickson has published a total of ten novels in a dozen languages. Erickson himself appeared briefly as a fictional character in Michael Ventura's 1996 novel, The Death of Frank Sinatra. Erickson has written for the New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Smithsonian, Rolling Stone, Conjunctions, American Prospect and Los Angeles magazine among others, and twice has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award.

A motion picture adaptation of Zeroville starring James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jacki Weaver and Megan Fox was released in September 2019.  Recurring motifs  Erickson's novels revolve around controversial and sometimes misunderstood concepts. One is slavery, both actual and metaphorical. Arc d'X begins with the story of the love affair between Thomas Jefferson and a slave girl, Sally Hemings. In a number of Erickson's novels men are profoundly trapped by what they seek or purport to possess, and in virtually all of his novels‚Äîparticularly The Sea Came in at Midnight and Our Ecstatic Days where female characters dominate‚Äîa female protagonist is the catalytic figure who sets events into motion. Another important theme in Erickson's novels is parenthood and the loss of a child. Our Ecstatic Days follows a mother's search for her missing son over the course of a quarter century. The Occupant from The Sea Came in at Midnight is left by his wife and child. In Days Between Stations Adolphe and Maurice Sarre are abandoned by their mother and Lauren's son Jules dies. The profound estrangement from his father of Zeroville's central character, Vikar, leads to his obsession with movies, and later he becomes a paternal figure to the teenage Zazi after her mother dies. In These Dreams of You, the adoptive parents of the four-year-old Ethiopian orphan Sheba set out to find the girl's birth mother; in turn Sheba and her brother reappear twelve years older in Shadowbahn on a road trip to reunite with their mother and reconcile with the memory of their father. Sometimes Erickson relies on autobiographical information filtered through an unconventional imagination. Amnesiascope is almost a memoir in which actual people and events from Erickson's life mix with his imagination. Recurring themes are music (in These Dreams of You and Shadowbahn) and filmmaking, presented from the perspective of a director (Days Between Stations and The Sea Came in at Midnight), screenwriter (Rubicon Beach), critic (Amnesiascope) and film editor (Zeroville). Often the films are transgressive and rejected by the audience. \\"For all his time-traveling, his dream logic, his cinematic jump-cuts, his erotic interludes, his post apocalyptic future worlds,\\" Sarah Vowell wrote for Salon in 2000, \\"...[Erickson's] narrative voice never quite sheds its fundamental idealism.\\" The preeminent theme of America dominates Erickson's novels from Rubicon Beach to Amnesiascope to These Dreams of You, culminating with Shadowbahn. Some of this work that has been described as apocalyptic now appears prescient. Since the late 1980s these stories have anticipated America's political crumbling and the slow obliteration of the world in which Erickson's characters live. Long before general public awareness of climate change, nature itself became an alien force out of control in Erickson's books (the long winter in Paris, sand storms in L.A. and the disappearance of water in Venice and the Mediterranean region in Days Between Stations; the earthquake in Amnesiascope; the lake that floods L.A. in both Rubicon Beach and Our Ecstatic Days; the vanishing rain in Shadowbahn). The characters of the novels often live in metropoles‚ÄîL.A., New York City, Berlin, Paris or Tokyo‚Äîin which unexpected natural phenomena cause chaos and reveal how brittle civilization actually is. Erickson makes occasional use of somewhat supernatural elements such as bizarre artifacts (a bottle with human eyes from Days Between Stations), the extraordinary gifts of some characters (Catherine from Rubicon Beach), and impossible historical events (the Twin Towers' reappearance in the Dakota Badlands from Shadowbahn). The most powerful force of Erickson's universe is love, often passionate, sensual, overpowering, unstoppable. Lovers hurt each other but at the same time cannot live without each other. When the love is lost, people become empty, bitter or full of hatred. The affection is almost like possession. Erickson's characters appear in multiple books. Besides the children of These Dreams of You who are grown in Shadowbahn, Adolphe Sarre from Days Between Stations is alluded to in Zeroville and Amnesiascope, Lauren from Days Between Stations reappears briefly in Arc d'X, and Carl has recurring cameos in Days Between Stations, Tours of the Black Clock, Amnesiascope and The Sea Came in at Midnight. Lauren and Janine from Days Between Stations, and Catherine and Leigh from Rubicon Beach, are imaginings of the protagonist in the subsequent Tours of the Black Clock. Wade and Mallory from Rubicon Beach reemerge as major characters in Arc d‚ÄôX as does Sally Hemings who is introduced in the supposedly nonfiction Leap Year. Viv from Amnesiascope returns years later as the adoptive mother in search of her daughter's past in These Dreams of You, and Maxxi Maraschino from The Sea Came In At Midnight is mentioned on a concert poster in Zeroville. Kristin features in both The Sea Came in at Midnight and Our Ecstatic Days while Banning Jainlight from Tours of the Black Clock manifests as an altered incarnation with the same name in Our Ecstatic Days. Cale from Rubicon Beach returns, in altered form with his name spelled Kale, in Our Ecstatic Days. Erickson's friend and fellow novelist Michael Ventura shows up in Leap Year, Amnesiascope and American Nomad.

It is a comical retelling of the Jonah tale, with a Newfoundland whaler as protagonist, but in this instance the whale gets his comeuppance.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quotjack-was- every-inch-a-sailorquot-emc. It may have been adapted from a New York City music-hall song \\"Every Inch a Sailor\\", which itself was a burlesque of \\"HMS Pinafore\\". This song was covered by Canadian children's singing group Sharon, Lois and Bram on The Elephant Show.  Lyrics  Upon the isle of Newfoundland there lived a sailor boy He was a handsome sailor lad, his father's pride and joy He was born on board his father's ship on a dark and stormy morn And he helped the crew harpoon a whale on the day that he was born Chorus: :Jack was every inch a sailor :Five and twenty years a whaler :Jack was every inch a sailor :He was born upon the bright blue sea When Jack grew up to be a man he sailed from shore to shore He sailed his ship around the world a dozen times or more Harpooning whales was play to him for he was very strong And he was also very tall and his beard was very long CHO One night while Jack was standing watch a storm began to blow It blew so hard that soon the ship was tossing to and fro A great big wave rolled up to Jack and washed him to the rail And he was tossed into the sea and swallowed by a whale CHO Now when that whale had swallowed Jack it soon began to shake For this old whale had got himself a mighty stomach ache Well now, said Jack, this poor old whale don't know what he's about And he grabbed that whale all by the tail and pulled him inside out CHO Another version of the song is this: :'Twas twenty-five or thirty years since Jack first saw the light, :He came into this world of woe one dark and stormy night; :He was born on board his father's ship as she was lying to, :'Bout twenty-five or thirty miles southeast of Baccalieu. : :::CHORUS: ::Oh, Jack was every inch a sailor, ::Five and twenty years a whaler; ::Jack was every inch a sailor, ::He was born upon the bright blue sea. : :When Jack grew up to be a man he went to the Labrador, :He fished in Indian Harbour where his father fished before; :On his returning in the fog he met a heavy gale, :And Jack was swept into the sea and swallowed by a whale. : :::CHORUS : :Oh, the whale went straight for Baffin Bay, 'bout ninety knots an hour, :And every time he'd blow a spray he'd send it in a shower; :Oh, now, says Jack unto himself, I must see what he's about, :He caught the whale all by the tail and turned him inside out. : :::CHORUS  References  See also  * List of Newfoundland songs Category:Canadian folk songs Category:Comedy songs Category:Songs about animals Category:Songs about sailors Category:Songs about fictional male characters Category:Sea shanties Category:Traditional children's songs Category:Newfoundland and Labrador folk songs Category:Baffin Bay Category:Jonah Category:Year of song unknown Category:Songs based on Canadian history ","title":"Jack Was Every Inch a Sailor"},{"id":"2297677","text":"Penelope Ann \\"Penny\\" Valentine (13 February 1943 ‚Äì 9 January 2003) was a British music journalist, rock critic, and occasional television personality. Biography Penny Valentine was born in London, of Jewish and Italian ancestry. In 1959 she became a trainee reporter, first on the Uxbridge Post, and in the early 1960s on Boyfriend, a weekly magazine for teen girls. In 1964, she joined the staff of Disc, a weekly pop music magazine (later Disc and Music Echo), as a journalist and record reviewer, becoming for a time Britain's most influential reviewer of new pop singles. According to fellow journalist Richard Williams, \\"She was probably the first woman to write about pop music as though it really mattered.\\" She loved soul music, and supported singers such as Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye before they became famous. In 1965 she also recorded the novelty single I Want To Kiss Ringo Goodbye which celebrates The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr. As a young woman, she also wrote articles for a variety of publications on the then-current \\"Swinging London\\" phenomenon. Chris Welch commented that she \\"was part of a social whirl of receptions, parties and night-clubbing that made Swinging London such fun...The Beatles and Rolling Stones certainly preferred to be interviewed by the vivacious young lady from Disc magazine than by some spotty chap in a raincoat.\\" She also made regular appearances on Juke Box Jury in the mid-1960s. In 1970 she left Disc to join a new magazine, Sounds, and in 1973 was hired by her friend Elton John to become the press officer for his record label, The Rocket Record Company. She also wrote for Record Mirror, and Melody Maker, and in the 1970s for the American rock magazine Creem. After a period working in New York City, she returned to London in 1975 to help launch another new magazine, Street Life, later joining Time Out before leaving in 1980 to help found the more politically radical City Limits. She became active in a number of bodies, including Women in Media and the National Union of Journalists. After gaining a BA in film studies and English, she then pursued a freelance career teaching and writing. With Vicki Wickham, she wrote a biography of Dusty Springfield entitled Dancing With Demons (2000). Valentine died at the age of 59 in 2003 after suffering from cancer for some time.

A political leader, state assemblyman, and state senator for over 30 years, Velella was indicted in 2002 on 25 counts of bribery and conspiracy for allegedly accepting at least $137,000 in exchange for steering public-works contracts to the paying parties.\\"Press Release Issued By Manhattan District Attorney (May 9, 2002)\\" He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a class E felony, admitting that he helped clients obtain business from government agencies, and that the clients paid fees in excess of $10,000 to his father's law firm, in exchange for a year in jail.\\"New York Times, State Senator Quits in a Deal Over a Bribery Indictment (May 14, 2002)\\" As part of the plea agreement reached with the Manhattan District Attorney, Velella resigned his seat in the State Senate and his position as Chairman of the Bronx County Republican Party. He was also disbarred. He served a total of six months (in two separate stints) of his sentence at Rikers Island. Biography Velella was born on September 25, 1944, in East Harlem, then a heavily Italian-American neighborhood, in Manhattan.\\"Official Guy Velella New York State Senate Biography\\" Velella's father, the late Vincent J. Velella, was a lawyer who became wealthy through real estate deals. The Velella family moved to the Bronx in the late 1950s. In 1967, Velella graduated from St. John's University, Jamaica, New York. He then earned a law degree from the Suffolk School of Law (today the Suffolk University Law School) in Boston, Massachusetts, and joined his father's law practice. In 1972, aged 28, Velella, a Republican, ran for the New York State Assembly in the East Bronx. The incumbent Democrat withdrew from the race unexpectedly, and Velella won the race. He served in the Assembly from 1973 to 1982, sitting in the 180th, 181st, 182nd, 183rd and 184th New York State Legislatures. After redistricting, Velella found himself running in a new Democratic district in 1982, which then covered Throggs Neck and Parkchester. In a bitter campaign, he ran against popular Assemblyman and head of the Parkchester Tenants Association John C. Dearie.\\"New York Times, 2 'Nice Guys' Vie in Dearie- Velella Assembly Race (October 18, 1982)\\" After losing that election by a wide margin, Velella told the Bronx News, a local weekly newspaper, that he was done with politics. In January 1983, Velella returned to practicing law full- time. Despite his pledge that his political career was over, Velella was elected to the local school board. Many political observers expected Velella to run for the seat in Congress held by Mario Biaggi, a Democrat, when he retired. Velella returned to elected office on April 22, 1986, when he was elected to the New York State Senate, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John D. Calandra. The three-way race was bitter and costly, as JoAnn Calandra, Calandra's widow, backed by the late senator's partisans and patronage recipients, and hoping to capitalize on the late senator's ties to the Senate Majority establishment, sought to retain family control of the seat. The Democratic candidate, Michael Durso, also generated interest. The 34th Senate District included mostly white neighborhoods in the Bronx and parts of lower Westchester County, areas hand-picked by Calandra during the last redistricting and including portions of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and all of Pelham. Velella received the endorsements of the Right to Life Party and the Bronx section of the Conservative Party of New York. In a battle that echoed those for the Republican nomination and the Senate Seat itself, Velella also became chairman of the Bronx Republican Party. He was subsequently re-elected to the State Senate in November 1986 and in every subsequent election until November 2002, sitting in the 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd, 194th and 195th New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat on May 14, 2004, as part of a plea bargain reached on criminal charges that he took bribes to help businesses win lucrative state contracts. According to the text of the indictment, the bribes were in the form of payments to the Velellas' law firm for little or no work. Popularity in district As a state senator, Velella brought millions of state dollars into his district, which funded local projects. Velella also endeared himself to his constituents through his advocacy on their behalf with the federal, state, and city government. Velella's success in securing money for his district and excellent record on constituent service made him very popular in his district, including conservative Democrats (or \\"Reagan Democrats\\").Norwood News, \\"Velella's Voting Record Is in Eye of Beholder\\" (November 2, 2000) Influence As one of the handful of Republican State Senators from New York City, Velella exercised considerable influence in the state legislature and in both Westchester County and New York City politics. Over the decades, many Democrats in the Assembly often turned to Velella to introduce their legislation in the New York State Senate, which was controlled by the Republicans from 1966 until 2009. In 1989, Velella became chairman of the powerful Senate Insurance Committee. In this capacity, Velella secured passage of numerous laws affecting the insurance industry in New York. Velella reached the height of his influence and power during the mid-1990s. He enjoyed access to important elected officials, many of them Republicans, such as U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Governor George Pataki, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and NYS Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. Velella used his many contacts to secure patronage jobs for his supporters. Other key backers such as Bill Newmark, the chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, joined his legislative payroll. During Rudy Giuliani's first mayoral bid in 1989, Velella and D'Amato acted together to deny Giuliani the support he needed to beat David Dinkins, the eventual Democratic nominee, even going so far as to engineer a completely spurious candidacy on the part of cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder to challenge Giuliani in the Republican primary. Victor B. Tosi, Velella's executive assistant and a long-time Bronx Republican activist, served as Lauder's campaign manager. Lauder lost the primary, but the nearly $13 million he spent on negative campaign commercials damaged Giuliani's candidacy. In the general election, Velella endorsed Giuliani, who went on to lose narrowly to Dinkins. Later, when D'Amato and the Governor-Elect Pataki decided to foment a coup against then-Majority Leader Ralph Marino, who had clashed repeatedly with Pataki during the latter's brief tenure in the New York State Senate, Velella acted as Pataki's and D'Amato's agent, drafting Senate Members for a Thanksgiving coup in 1994 against Long Island's Marino and in favor of upstate Rensselaer County's Joe Bruno. This occurred even though Velella had been, upon the retirement of former Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson, one of a small circle who had helped to engineer Marino's ascension to the Leader's post and was one of Marino's most visible and rewarded allies during the ensuing years. While serving in the state legislature, Velella also maintained a thriving law practice, which benefited from his Senate role as Insurance Chairman.\\"New York Times, In Albany, Ally of Insurers Profits From Them (February 4, 2001)\\" He was a partner, with his father, in Velella, Velella, Basso, and Calandra, a law firm in the Morris Park section of The Bronx. After his conviction, Velella surrendered his law license. In 2004, the law firm changed its name to Velella, Basso, and Cirrincione and then, after the retirement of Vincent Velella, to Basso and Cirrincione. The law firm is now known as Velella & Basso.https://www.bassolawny.com/ Controversies and scandals In 1987, Velella admitted that he had fathered a child out of wedlock with an Albany woman with whom he had had a longtime affair.\\"New York Daily News, Charge Labor Big Ripped Off Unions (October 11, 2004)\\" The year before, Velella's supporters distributed campaign literature that championed him as an advocate of family values and criticized liberal Democrats for undermining sexual morality. Velella later said he had made financial arrangements with the child's mother to support his newborn daughter, Alexandra Velella. In 1993, Velella was accused of fixing local school board elections. No criminal charges were filed.New York Times (May 14, 1996) \\"Web of Patronage in Schools Grip Those Who Can Undo It\\" City-wide races In 1981, then-Assemblyman Velella ran for New York City Council President against the incumbent Democrat, Carol Bellamy and lost by a landslide. In 1985, Velella ran for New York City Comptroller against the three-time Democratic incumbent, Harrison J. Goldin, but also lost by a wide margin. As Bronx Republican Chairman In 1986, Velella became the chairman of the Bronx Republican Party. He resigned that position in 2004. Critics charged that Velella did nothing to build the local GOP and maintained a \\"non-aggression pact\\" with the Bronx County Democratic organization.Village Voice, A Bronx Tale (August 16, 2000) With the exception of himself, no other Republican was ever elected to any office in the Bronx during his 18-year term. In 1994 and 1996, Velella ran with the endorsement of the Bronx Democratic Party. Although he maintained a cordial and mutually-beneficial relationship with the Bronx Democratic political machine, Velella did work hard to get Republicans elected to prominent offices. In 1992, Velella campaigned for Senator D'Amato, who was facing a tough re-election fight against Democratic challenger, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams. D'Amato was narrowly re-elected. Velella and Giuliani put aside their previous animosity, and the Bronx Republican leader enthusiastically campaigned for him in 1993. On Election Day, Velella oversaw a \\"ballot security program,\\" which sought to deter voter fraud at the polls. In 1994, Velella devoted his resources to the Pataki and Vacco campaigns, which were both successful. In 2001, Velella endorsed former Bronx Borough President and Congressman Herman Badillo, who became a Republican in the 1990s, in the race to succeed the term-limited Mayor Giuliani. In the Republican primary, Badillo faced billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who won the endorsement of the city's four other Republican county chairmen in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. When Velella realized he was the only Republican county chairman in the city supporting Badillo, Velella stopped actively campaigning for Badillo and publicly called on him to withdraw from the race. Velella explained to the New York Post that he didn't like primaries although he enthusiastically backed Lauder in 1989 against Giuliani. Bloomberg won the primary handily. Velella then campaigned for Bloomberg, who went on to narrowly defeat Mark Green in the general election. StopGuy.com In late 2002, a number of Morris Park residents expressed their concerns over a (now- defunct) web site with the domain www.morrispark.com. The site reportedly contained pornographic images, racial and ethnic jokes and insults, and criticism of local businesses, community leaders and politicians, including Velella.New York Times (December 15, 2002) \\"Neighborhood Report: Morris Park; A Trojan Horse on the Web Has Ethnic Insults and Smut\\" The site's domain was registered under what was believed to be a false name, and its owner has never been identified. Velella announced that he would draft legislation that would require web site operators to register with the New York State Attorney General. Velella's action sparked the creation of a now-defunct \\"Stop Guy\\" Web site. Early release controversy On June 21, 2004, Velella was sentenced to one year in jail for bribery under a plea deal, but was released from Rikers Island on September 28, 2004 after less than twelve weeks by the Local Conditional Release Commission, an obscure New York City agency. (Ironically, in the State Senate, Velella had voted to abolish the LCRC.) His early release sparked outrage, especially in the media. Both the New York Post and New York Daily News, which both endorsed Velella in past campaigns, published editorials demanding his return to jail. The New York Post pasted Velella's face on a Monopoly \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card and published it daily in its opinion section. Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for an investigation into the circumstances of Velella's early release. The city's Department of Investigations, which looked into the matter, found that the Local Conditional Release Commission had violated established procedures when it granted Velella's request. Mayor Bloomberg then forced the resignation of all four commission members in October and reconstituted the panel by appointing five new members, who on November 19, 2004, ordered Velella back to prison. Although Velella appealed the decision, the New York State Appeals Court refused to give him another reprieve.\\"New York Times, It's Back to Jail For Velella, 3 Months After His Disputed Release (December 28, 2004)\\" He returned to Rikers Island in late December to resume his sentence, and was released on March 18, 2005, after serving only 182 days of his original one-year sentence. Additional notoriety Guy Velella received slot #94 in reporter and conservative commentator Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America, citing his change in stance of crime and justice issues before and after his incarceration .

It is the first major ridge in the far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains, and reaches its highest elevation (the state's highest), 1,803 feet, at High Point in Montague Township. Kittatinny Mountain forms the eastern side of Wallpack Valley; the western side comprises the Wallpack Ridge (highest elevation: above sea level. Protected areas Most of the range is publicly owned and protected. In the far northeast, High Point State Park protects the area around High Point itself. Further southwest, Stokes State Forest encompasses much of the range from the southern boundary of High Point State Park to the eastern boundary of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. The recreation area encompasses the entire southern half of the range, and also contains the smaller Worthington State Forest, which also protects the southwestern end of the range near the Delaware Water Gap itself. Geology thumb The name comes from a Lenape Native American word meaning \\"endless hill\\" or \\"great mountain\\". The highest peak in the range is High Point at , which is also the highest point in the state of New Jersey. This peak is located in High Point state park and has a road leading to the top. The second highest mountain is Sunrise Mountain, located within Stokes State Forest. The elevation here is and has a road leading almost to the top. At the top there is a shelter with a roof but no sides. The Kittatinny Mountain is of the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate which is mainly composed of quartz. Due to the hardness of the quartz, the mountain is extremely resistant to weathering. Around four hundred fifty million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America. The North American plate went under the chain of islands. The islands went on top of the edge of North America creating the Highlands and the Kittatinny Valley which is the Ordovician Martinsburg Shale. Quartz and other sedimentary conglomerate was transported to the inland sea, which was over part of the Martinsburg Shale. A small continent then collided with North America around four hundred million years ago. Geologic pressure resulted, which caused compression and then folding and faulting resulted. The folding ran perpendicular to the directional forces. During folding, intense heat melted silica which cemented the quartz and other stones together. Also the intense heat allowed the rock layers to bend, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born. Near the base of the west side of the mountain is the Silurian High Falls Formation, which is red and green shale and sandstone. The east side of the mountain near the base is of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation which contains slate, shale and sandstone. The top of the mountain has a fairly even elevation ranging between and . There are two exceptions. One is Culver's Gap, which was created by an ancient stream which was diverted and is now a wind gap. The base of Culver's Gap is at least below the top of the mountain. Culver's Gap is located near Culver's Lake, just west of Branchville. The second is a small gap in the mountain, south of Catfish Pond, which is north of the gap. This gap is about deep. Culver's Gap was a route used by Paleo Indians and the Lenape Native Americans to go through the mountain to trade and hunt. The second is a groove or depression in the mountain ridge near Catfish Pond. This is about deep as the base of the depression is and the top of the mountain at that place is . The top of the mountain ranges from 50 meters wide to nearly wide. West of the Kittatinny Mountain, at the northwestern end is the Port Jervis trough, also called the Minisink Valley. Next to the mountain on the western side is the Flatbrook Valley or Walpack Valley which runs from Steam Mill to Flatbrookville. From the Delaware Water Gap to the New York line is but the ridges continues into New York State where it is known as the Shawangunk Mountains. The ridge continues to nearly Kingston, New York. The Wisconsin glacier covered the entire mountain about 21,000 BC, and melted about 13,000 BC. The terminal moraine is located near Belvidere. The glacier has left end moraines, periglacial rock fields, and kettles, at the northern end of the mountain in Stokes State Forest. The area was a Tundra biome after the glacier melted and then became a Taiga biome as the climate warmed. At that time coniferous trees such as spruce and pine inhabited the area. The area warmed more around 8000 BC so oak, maple, birch, willow, and other deciduous trees began to grow. Paleo Indians Paleo Indians inhabited the Delaware River Valley around 10,500 BC. after the Wisconsin Glacier melted. They hunted, fished and gathered plants to eat in the Delaware Valley and on Kittatinny Mountain. They had no permanent camps and traveled often in search of food. As the glacier melted, grasslands developed which eventually turned into coniferous and later deciduous forests after thousands of years. Big game roamed the grassland which allowed Paleo Indians to survive. Around 8000 B.C. deciduous trees began to grow, in which nut trees began to grow to allow the collection of nuts. This allowed Paleo Indian populations to increase slowly. The Marshall Creek Mastodon found just north of the Gap was dated at 10,210BC ¬±180 years. Other big game existed at the time such as caribou and muskox. Native Americans The Lenape Native Americans that came to the area two thousand years ago from the Mississippi River valley traveled on the mountain in search of plant foods and game. They collected acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts, beech nuts, chestnuts, and butternuts from the deciduous forest and collected water from fresh streams. The Lenapes also hunted deer, elk, and bear on the mountain. Waterfalls, cliffs and lakes thumb There is one waterfall on the western side of the mountain known as Buttermilk Falls. This is about south of US Route 206, in which a dirt road leads to the base of it. A wooden staircase has been built near it, so people can climb to the top. A second falls is seasonable during heavy rains next to Interstate 80 near the Big Cliffs. Water slides over the rocks and drops over a small ledge before going under Interstste 80. There are several cliffs on the mountain. The largest is located at the Delaware Water Gap. The cliff is up to high and starts at Interstate 80 and extends about 400 meters along the mountain The second largest cliff is located north of the Gap, on the eastern side. Small rock faces exist on the western face and eastern face along the mountain. The southeastern face of the mountain has a steeper pitch than the northwestern face. The top of the mountain has 14 lakes and ponds. Sunfish Pond, Catfish Pond, Mountain Ridge Lake, Blue Mountain Lake, Long Pine Pond, Lake Success, Crater Lake, Hemlock Lake, Kittatinny Lake, Steeny Kill Lake and Lake Marcia are some of them. Lake Marcia is the lake with the highest elevation on the mountain, above sea level. This lake is located in High Point State Park which is at the northern end of Kittatinny Mountain. Flora and fauna The mountain is a northern deciduous forest of various oaks, hickories, maples, birches, walnut, elm, ash, birch, sycamore, cherry, beech, chestnut, and sweet gum. Wild blueberries and rhodendrum also grow on the mountain. Animals such as whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, gray fox, bobcats, beaver, black bears as well as a large variety of birds inhabit the mountain. Turkey Vultures and Red Tail Hawks are also common. Fish such as trout, pickerel, and bass are also in the lakes. Mining Copper mining began in the 1750s at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine, which is north of the Gap, off Old Mine Road. This mine is located in the Silurian High Falls Formation on the west side of the mountain. This sandstone is very hard and made mining very difficult. The copper was between 2 and 3 percent in the ore which made mining unprofitable. Mining was done in the 1800s, by various companies which went bankrupt. The mine sold several times. Silver mining began in the 1880s with John Snook digging a mine at the northern end and western face of the Kittatinny mountain in an area now known as Stokes State Forest. He extracted silver ore for a short time and the silver ore was depleted. The mine is now flooded with water. Map of the \\"Sedimentary Appalachians\\" Province in the New York Bight region including the Valley and Ridge Province and the Allegheny Plateau and the Catskill Mountains Kittatinny and Flatbrook Valleys To the east of the Kittatinny Mountain, is the Great Kittatinny Valley. This is drained by the Paulinskill river in the south and the Wallkill River in the north. The Big Flatbrook drains the mountain on the northwestern end beginning at Steam mill swamp and flows in a southwesterly direction which drains into the Delaware River near Flatbrookville. This area is known as the Flatbrook Valley. The Port Jervis trough is at the northwestern end of the mountain. The Delaware River flows near the mountain at the south end, finally cutting across the ridge at the Delaware Water Gap just south of Mount Tammany. The Kittatinnies are a far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. In Pennsylvania, the ridge forming the Kittatinnies becomes known as Blue Mountain and runs southwest for , nearly to Maryland. In Franklin County, Pennsylvania, however, a parallel ridge to Blue Mountain is named \\"Kittatinny Mountain\\"; the Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels through both ridges (a very short distance apart) with the western tunnel named \\"Kittatinny Mountain\\" and the eastern one \\"Blue Mountain.\\" To the north in New York, the ridge is known as the Shawangunk Mountains which goes to Kingston, New York.

Mozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785‚Äì1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after completing his Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major. As he intended to perform the work himself, Mozart did not write out the soloist's part in full. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Chronologically, the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos. The work is one of only two minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos features a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, in E major‚Äîthe relative major of C minor‚Äîfeatures a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, is a theme and eight variations in C minor. The work is one of Mozart's most advanced compositions in the concerto genre. Its early admirers included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. Musicologist Arthur Hutchings declared it to be, taken as a whole, Mozart's greatest piano concerto. Background The concerto was premiered at the Burgtheater (pictured) in Vienna. Mozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785‚Äì86, during his fourth season in Vienna. It was the third in a set of three concertos composed in quick succession, the others being No. 22 in E major and No. 23 in A major. Mozart finished composing the No. 24 shortly before the premiere of his comic opera The Marriage of Figaro; the two works are assigned adjacent numbers of 491 and 492 in the K√∂chel catalogue. Although composed at the same time, the two works contrast greatly: the opera is almost entirely in major keys while the concerto is one of Mozart's few minor-key works. The pianist and musicologist Robert D. Levin suggests that the concerto, along with the two concertos that precede it, may have served as an outlet for a darker aspect of Mozart's creativity at the time he was composing the comic opera. The premiere of the concerto was on either 3 or 7 April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna; Mozart featured as the soloist and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard. In 1800, Mozart's widow Constanze sold the original score of the work to the publisher Johann Anton Andr√© of Offenbach am Main. It passed through several private hands during the nineteenth century before Sir George Donaldson, a Scottish philanthropist, donated it to the Royal College of Music in 1894. The College still houses the manuscript today. (product page) The original score contains no tempo markings; the tempo for each movement is known only from the entries Mozart made into his catalogue. The orchestral parts in the original score are written in a clear manner. The solo part, on the other hand, is often incomplete: on many occasions in the score Mozart notated only the outer parts of passages of scales or broken chords. This suggests that Mozart improvised much of the solo part when performing the work. The score also contains late additions, including that of the second subject of the first movement's orchestral exposition. There is the occasional notation error in the score, which musicologist Friedrich Blume attributed to Mozart having \\"obviously written in great haste and under internal strain\\". Music=Overview= The concerto is divided into the following three movements: The concerto is scored for one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. This is the largest array of instruments for which Mozart composed any of his concertos. It is one of only two of Mozart's piano concertos that are scored for both oboes and clarinets (the other, his concerto for two pianos, has clarinets only in the revised version). The clarinet was not at the time a conventional orchestral instrument. Robert D. Levin writes: \\"The richness of wind sonority, due to the inclusion of oboes and clarinets, is the central timbral characteristic of [the concerto]: time and again in all three movements the winds push the strings completely to the side.\\" The solo instrument for the concerto is scored as a \\"cembalo\\". This term often denotes a harpsichord, but in this concerto, Mozart used it as a generic term that encompassed the fortepiano, an eighteenth-century version of the modern piano that among other things was more dynamically capable than the harpsichord. =I. Allegro= The first movement is longer and more complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre. It is in ; among Mozart's 27 piano concertos, No. 4 in G Major, No. 11 in F major and No. 14 in E major are the only others to commence in triple metre. The first movement follows the standard outline of a sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period. It begins with an orchestral exposition, which is followed by a solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda. Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation. Exposition The orchestral exposition, 99 measures long, presents two groups of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures, it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 140 \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\time 3/4 c2.(\\\\p^\\\\markup { \\\\column { \\\\line { Principal theme } \\\\line { \\\\bold { Allegro } } } } es2.) aes2( g4) fis4-. es'-. r8. fis,16 aes4( g f!) e-. des'-. r8. e,16 ges4( f es!) d-. b'-. r8. d,16 es4-. c'-. r8. es,16 aes4 aes,( a bes b c) f g g, c } The solo exposition follows its orchestral counterpart, and it is here that convention is discarded from the outset: the piano does not enter with the principal theme. Instead, it has an 18-measure solo passage. It is only after this passage that the principal theme appears, carried by the orchestra. The piano then picks up the theme from its seventh measure. Another departure from convention is that the solo exposition does not re-state the secondary theme from the orchestral exposition. Instead, a succession of new secondary thematic material appears. Musicologist Donald Tovey considered this introduction of new material to be \\"utterly subversive of the doctrine that the function of the opening tutti [the orchestral exposition] was to predict what the solo had to say.\\" One hundred measures into the solo exposition, which is now in the relative major of E, the piano plays a cadential trill, leading the orchestra from the dominant seventh to the tonic. This suggests to the listener that the solo exposition has reached an end, but Mozart instead gives the woodwinds a new theme. The exposition continues for another 60 or so measures, before another cadential trill brings about the real conclusion, prompting a ritornello that connects the exposition with the development. The pianist and musicologist Charles Rosen argues that Mozart thus created a \\"double exposition\\". Rosen also suggests that this explains why Mozart made substantial elongations to the orchestral exposition during the composition process; he needed a longer orchestral exposition to balance its \\"double\\" solo counterpart. Development The development begins with the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, this time in the relative major of E. The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material. In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question. The final question is asked in C minor and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme. The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration. After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as \\"one of the few [occasions] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained\\", and which Tovey describes as a passage of \\"fine, severe massiveness\\". The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme. This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme. Recapitulation, cadenza and coda The wide range of thematic material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form, contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, which has not been heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza. Mozart did not write down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no evidence of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Faur√©, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one. The conventional Mozartian coda concludes with an orchestral tutti and no written-out part for the soloist. In this movement, Mozart breaks with convention: the soloist interrupts the tutti with a virtuosic passage of sixteenth notes and accompanies the orchestra through to the final pianissimo C-minor chords. = II. Larghetto = Alfred Einstein said of the concerto's second movement that it \\"moves in regions of the purest and most moving tranquility, and has a transcendent simplicity of expression\\". Marked Larghetto, the movement is in E major and cut common time. The trumpets and timpani play no part; they return for the third movement. The movement opens with the soloist playing the four-measure principal theme alone; it is then repeated by the orchestra. : \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 8 = 100 \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 bes4^\\\\markup { \\\\column { \\\\line { Principal theme } \\\\line { \\\\bold { Larghetto } } } } bes8. bes16 bes8( es) es4 g8( d es f) bes,2 g'4 g8. g16 bes8.( g16) es4 d,8 d d d es4 r4 } This theme is, in the words of Michael Steinberg, one of \\"extreme simplicity\\". Donald Tovey refers to the fourth bar, extremely bare and lacking any ornamentation, as \\"naive\\", but considers that Mozart intended for it to be so. Mozart's first sketch of the movement was much more complex. He likely simplified the theme to provide a greater contrast with the dark intensity of the first movement. After the orchestra repeats the principal theme, there is a very simple bridge or transitional passage that Girdlestone calls \\"but a sketch\\" to be ornamented by the soloist, arguing that \\"to play it as printed is to betray the memory of Mozart\\". Following the bridge passage, the soloist plays the initial four- measure theme for a second time, before the orchestra commences a new section of the movement, in C minor. A brief return of the principal theme, its rhythm altered, separates the C minor section from a section in A major. After this new section, the principal theme returns to mark the end of the movement, its rhythm altered yet again. Now, the theme is played twice by the soloist, the two appearances being connected by the same simple bridge passage from the beginning of the movement. Girdlestone argues that here \\"the soloist will have to draw on his imagination to adorn [the simple bridge passage] a second time\\". The overall structure of the movement is thus ABACA, making the movement in rondo form. In the middle statement of the principal theme (between the C minor and A major sections), there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast. The form of the movement is nearly identical to that of the second movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in B major, K. 570. = III. Allegretto = The third movement features a theme in C minor followed by eight variations upon it. Hutchings considered it \\"both Mozart's finest essay in variation form and also his best concerto finale.\\" : \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 112 \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 \\\\partial 4 g4\\\\p(^\\\\markup { \\\\column { \\\\line { Theme } \\\\line { \\\\bold { Allegretto } } } } es) es( d) d( c) r r g'( c) c( es fis,) g r r g( aes) aes-.( aes-. aes-.) \\\\grace { aes32( bes32} c4) bes8 aes g4 g \\\\grace { g32( a32} bes4) a!8 g g4( fis) \\\\partial 2. g r r \\\\bar \\":..:\\" \\\\break \\\\partial 4 g( f) g( es) g( d) r r aes~ aes( g fis f) es r r c( des) des-.( des-. des-.) \\\\grace { des32( es32} f4) es8 des! c4 c \\\\grace { c32( d!32} es4) d8 c c4( b) \\\\partial 2. c r r \\\\bar \\":.\\" } The tempo marking for the movement is Allegretto. Rosen opines that this calls for a march-like speed and argues that the movement is \\"generally taken too fast under the delusion that a quick tempo will give it a power commensurate with that of the opening movement.\\" Pianist Angela Hewitt sees in the movement not a march but a \\"sinister dance\\". The movement opens with the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to C minor. The soloist does not play any part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment. Variations II to VI are what Girdlestone and Hutchings independently describe as \\"double\\" variations. Within each variation, each of the eight-measure phrases from the theme is further varied upon its repeat (AXAYBXBY). Variations IV and VI are in major keys. Tovey refers to the former (in A) as \\"cheerful\\" and the latter (in C) as \\"graceful\\". Between the two major-key variations, Variation V returns to C minor; Girdlestone describes this variation as \\"one of the most moving\\". Variation VII is half the length of the preceding variations, as it omits the repeat of each eight-measure phrase. This variation concludes with an extra three-measure passage that culminates in a dominant chord, announcing the arrival of a cadenza. After the cadenza, the soloist opens the eighth and final variation alone, with the orchestra joining after 19 measures. The arrival of the final variation also brings a change in metre: from cut common time to compound duple time. Both the final variation and the coda which follows contain numerous neapolitan-sixth chords. Girdlestone referred to the \\"haunting\\" effect of these chords and stated that the coda ultimately \\"proclaims with desperation the triumph of the minor mode\\". Critical reception Ludwig van Beethoven admired the concerto and it may have influenced his Piano Concerto No. 3, also in C minor. After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked to a colleague that \\"[w]e shall never be able to do anything like that.\\" Johannes Brahms also admired the concerto, encouraging Clara Schumann to play it, and wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. Brahms referred to the work as a \\"masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas.\\"; the quote is Wen's translation from the work of Richard Heuberger, Erinnerungen an Johannes Brahms, Tutzing, 1971, p. 93. According to Heuberger, Brahms' original statement in German was: \\"ein Wunderwerk der Kunst und voll genialer Einf√§lle\\". Among modern and twentieth- century scholars, Cuthbert Girdlestone states that the concerto \\"is in all respects one of [Mozart's] greatest; we would fain say: the greatest, were it not impossible to choose between four or five of them.\\" Referring to the \\"dark, tragic and passionate\\" nature of the concerto, Alfred Einstein states that \\"it is hard to imagine the expression on the faces of the Viennese public\\" when Mozart premiered the work. The musicologist Simon P. Keefe, in an exegesis of all of Mozart's piano concertos, writes that the No. 24 is \\"a climactic and culminating work in Mozart's piano concerto oeuvre, firmly linked to its predecessors, yet decisively transcending them at the same time.\\" The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is \\"not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed\\". Arthur Hutchings's view is that \\"whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'.\\" Notes, references and sources=NotesReferencesSources=        External links * * 24 Category:Compositions in C minor Category:1786 compositions ","title":"Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)"},{"id":"2297714","text":"The Human Rights Party (HRP) was a left-wing political party that existed in Michigan during the early and mid-1970s. The party achieved electoral success in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. It eventually expanded to include several other Michigan cities with large student populations. In 1975, the HRP became the Socialist Human Rights Party, and it later merged with the Socialist Party of Michigan. right Origins of the HRP The organization was established in 1970 under the leadership of Zolton Ferency, and it quickly gained strength following the 1971 ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which gave 18-year-olds the right to vote. In October 1971, the Radical Independent Party of Ann Arbor, Michigan (RIP), which had been formed by members of the Students for a Democratic Society, New University Conference, and International Socialists, merged with the HRP. The Human Rights Party‚Äôs platform included calls for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from foreign soil, the end of the ROTC and Selective Service, repeal of laws against homosexuality and prostitution, the closure of all state prisons, and provision of day care and health care based on ability to pay. Working to gain electoral votes among the city's large population of students at the University of Michigan, the HRP succeeded in electing two candidates to the Ann Arbor city council in 1972, and successfully defended one of the seats in 1974. Building support through rock concerts, local radio spots, and coverage in the underground press, the HRP won 25 percent of the 30,000 ballots cast in the 1972 Ann Arbor municipal election.Agis Salpukas, \\"Ann Arbor Radicals Got Students‚Äô Aid,\\" New York Times, 9 Apr. 1972, p. 62. The party's victors in the city-council races ‚Äì Jerry DeGrieck, a history student at the University of Michigan, and Nancy Wechsler, a U-M graduate, both 22 years of age ‚Äì defeated two professors, both of whom were Democrats, and one of whom was an incumbent member of the City Council. As DeGrieck later noted, the party garnered substantial support not only from students, but also from low-income voters and factory workers.\\"Ann Arbor Radicals Win 2 Council Seats,\\" Chicago Tribune, 4 Apr. 1972, p. 10. In two other Ann Arbor wards, reported the New York Times, \\"the Human Rights Party drew off enough votes from the Democratic candidates to help conservative Republicans win.\\"Agis Salpukas, \\"Ann Arbor Radicals Got Students' Aid,\\" New York Times, 9 Apr. 1972, p. 62. In the next-door city of Ypsilanti, the HRP elected two city council members in 1974, both of whom were re-elected in 1976. During the 1972 election, the HRP chose a fifteen-year-old Sonia Yaco, an activist affiliated with Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor, as its Ann Arbor school-board candidate. Yaco's demands for a student voice in school governance earned her 1,300 votes as a write-in candidate, or eight percent of the total, and indirectly influenced the establishment of the experimental alternative Community High School later that year.Mike Mosher, \\"Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor: Young, Gifted and Media-Savvy\\" , Bad Subjects, no. 47 (January 2000). One of the first HRP candidates was Lawrence (\\"Larry\\") Pallozola, who unsuccessfully ran for school board in Garden City, Michigan, in the early 1970s. The HRP in government=Ann Arbor City Council= From April 1972 to April 1973, the two Human Rights representatives were able to significantly influence the decisions of the Ann Arbor city council, since no political party held a majority. In addition to the HRP members, there were five Republicans and four Democrats. During their time on city council, HRP members successfully pushed for a number of progressive ordinances, including the city's famously lenient \\"five-dollar pot law,\\" which had the effect of decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use (see Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan). In addition, the HRP led a push for a citywide anti- discrimination ordinance, which banned discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, age, and religion. The ordinance was the first of its kind in Michigan. In 1972, the pioneering ordinance was amended to add sexual orientation, and to require affirmative-action measures by city contractors. On zoning issues, the party worked to restrict the construction of fast-food chains in the city's downtown area. Alongside its electoral work, the HRP put on a number of protests, supported area workers' strikes, organized city tenants, and aided the anti-war movement. As Nancy Wechsler told the Wall Street Journal, the HRP also fought successfully to set aside federal revenue- sharing dollars for health and child care at a time when \\"most cities are spending revenue-sharing money for more police cars.\\"Wechsler quoted in \\"Youthful Office Holders Find Jobs Frustrating But Still Buy the System,\\" Wall Street Journal, 5 Jun. 1973, p. 1. At a joint press conference following a homophobic incident at a local restaurant, both of the 1972 HRP winners, Nancy Wechsler and Jerry DeGrieck, came out as gay and lesbian during their term on city council - thus simultaneously becoming the first openly lesbian and openly gay elected public officials in the United States. When Wechsler declined to run for reelection in 1974, her seat was won by HRP candidate Kathy Kozachenko. Already publicly known to be a lesbian, she thus became the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in the United States.Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud, \\"Gay and Proud,\\" Michigan Daily, 12 Feb. 1999 =Ypsilanti City Council= In 1974 the HRP activists in Ypsilanti helped to pass the Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative, a $5 fine for marijuana use or possession.Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative covered in \\"Ann Arbor Votes $5 Fine for the Use of Marijuana,\\" New York Times, 3 Apr. 1974, p. 10. In the same election, the HRP elected council members Eric Jackson and Harold Baize to their first term of office. Jackson and Baize championed anti- discrimination, fair rental practices, women's rights, and environmental issues. When Ypsilanti police ignored the voter's mandate by enforcing State marijuana laws rather than the Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative, Jackson and Baize called for an emergency meeting of the city council to deal with the issue. Although most of the other members of the city council boycotted the meeting, hundreds of citizens did not, resulting in a near riot. Human Rights Party city council members Eric Jackson and Harold Baize were re-elected in 1976 and continued their struggles for progressive policies. Following the loss of ballot status for the Michigan HRP, Harold Baize was elected to a third term as a Democrat in 1978. The Ypsilanti HRP changed its name to the Democratic Socialist Caucus and elected other members to the city council as well as electing Peter Murdock as mayor. At one point, the DSC controlled nine of the eleven city council seats as well as the mayor's position. It ceased to exist in 1986. The HRP and instant-runoff voting in Ann Arbor With the introduction of a strong third party in Ann Arbor, concerns grew among Democrats and HRP supporters that the city's progressive vote would be split, thus allowing Republicans to win offices on pluralities. This scenario came to pass soon after the emergence of the HRP. In 1973 Republican James E. Stephenson won the mayoral office with a plurality, defeating Democratic candidate Franz J. Mogdis and HRP candidate Benita Kaimowitz despite garnering only 47% of the vote. To head off a repeat of this result, the HRP spearheaded a petition campaign to place the Instant-runoff voting (IRV) system on the city ballot in spring of 1974. Most Democratic and HRP voters supported the proposal, which passed with 52% approval. In April 1975, during the first (and only) Ann Arbor mayoral race using IRV, the Republican incumbent James E. Stephenson received 49% of the first-choice ballots, leading his Democratic challenger Al Wheeler, who received 40%, and the HRP candidate Carol Ernst with 11%. However, since most HRP voters had ranked Wheeler as their second choice, these votes moved to the Democrat's column, and Wheeler won the election by a slim 121 votes, becoming the city's first African American mayor.Jonathan Marwil, A History of Ann Arbor (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1990), 164-165. The election represented the first use of IRV in a U.S. mayoral contest. The IRV system survived a court challenge by Republicans, but Ann Arbor voters repealed the system in an April 1976 special election. The IRV system was not again used in a United States election until San Francisco began using a similar system in 2004. End of the HRP With the nationwide decline in student activism, the Human Rights Party's power waned in the mid-1970s. In 1973, Ann Arbor's Democratic/HRP governing coalition lost power, as Republican James E. Stephenson won the mayoralty and Republicans also took control of seven of the ten council seats.\\"Ann Arbor,\\" Washington Post, 4 Apr. 1973, p. A20. The Ann Arbor chapter lost its last remaining city-council seat in 1976. In 1975, the HRP became the Socialist Human Rights Party, and it later merged with the Socialist Party of Michigan. Some members joined the Democratic Party. However, several of its landmark initiatives, notably the Ann Arbor anti-discrimination ordinance and the lenient municipal marijuana penalties, survive in modified form to this day.

She and her husband, Rich LeFevre, are said to form the \\"First Family of Competitive Eating\\" in spite of having normal weights and ages around 60, and are both top ranked members of the International Federation of Competitive Eating. The childless couple has combined to take two of the top seven places in Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2003, 2004, and 2005. She is nicknamed \\"The Madam of Etiquette\\" for her relative degree of decorum while consuming mass quantities of food quickly. Her trademark technique is called the \\"Carlene Pop,\\" in which she bounces up and down while eating to get the food to settle. LeFevre grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and met her husband at a square dance in Daly City, California. She has worked as an elementary school teacher, aerobics instructor, and a Mary Kay cosmetics saleswoman. Her first notable gastronomic achievement was finishing the famed 72 ounce steak from the Big Texan steakhouse in Amarillo, Texas in 1985. The restaurant provided her meal for free after she finished the steak in under an hour. She has bested the Big Texan's challenge on more than ten occasions since then, and one such event was filmed for the Ripley's Believe It Or Not television program in 2000.

Windsor Star, November 7, 1986. and aspired to revive the freeform style and creative experimentation associated with rock radio stations in the 1960s and 1970s. The show's original host was Ron Robinson.\\"CBC's Night Lines: a renaissance for rock radio\\". The Globe and Mail, September 27, 1986. Ralph Benmergui succeeded him, and was in turn followed by David Wisdom, who hosted the program from 1987 until the end of its run. During the early years with hosts Robinson and Benmergui the show was produced from CBC Winnipeg by Ross Porter. When David Wisdom took over the hosting duties in 1987, the show moved to CBC Vancouver and was produced by Susan Englebert. Features Regular features of the show during Wisdom's tenure included: * Ten Singles in Alphabetical Order. After host David Wisdom alphabetized his mammoth 7\\" vinyl 45 rpm singles collection by artist, he set aside time each weekend to play one single each by ten consecutive alphabetized artists, starting at \\"A\\" and continuing until he reached the end of his collection in the \\"Z\\"s (approximately nine years later). * Listener requests via answering machine. Night Lines listeners could call up an answering machine in CBC's Vancouver studios and, after answering a \\"skill- testing question\\" (by rule, something open-ended and usually bordering on philosophical, such as \\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\\"), request a song for Wisdom to play during the following weekend's shows. Regular callers to the request line became part of the show's fabric. Some consistent callers included Vicki from Surrey (who later moved and became Vicki from Vancouver), Gilbert from Transcona (who used a mock-Gilbert Gottfried voice on the answering machine), Norm from Richmond, Rocky from Thunder Bay, Milton the Cabbie, Joanna from Hamilton, Sonya from Port Lambton, Ontario, Sean from Brandon, Manitoba, and Lori from Southfield, Michigan (USA). * Soundbite Sensation Contests. Once each year, Wisdom would create a 6-to-8 minute audio collage containing bits of 50-100 different songs, and challenge listeners to identify the songs found within, with prizes (usually Night Lines T-shirts) going to the top entries. The collages usually had a unifying theme, among them guitar riffs, beginnings of songs, and celebrity names sung in song lyrics. * The Hour of Power, in which control of the airwaves was turned over to an audience member for one hour each weekend. When this feature started, listeners would send in scripts containing text for Wisdom to read on-air and lists of songs to play in-between the spoken text. As time went on, more and more Hours of Power were performed live in-studio by listeners, musicians, friends of David Wisdom's, etc. Grant Lawrence, now one of the hosts on CBC Radio 3, began his association with the CBC as a contributor to Night Lines, calling the show to share stories about life on tour with his band The Smugglers. Cancellation Night Lines ended on August 31, 1997. The show's final episode featured an in-studio performance by Rheostatics. Rheostatics subsequently released that performance on CD as The Nightlines Sessions. Wisdom went on to cohost the new series RadioSonic with Leora Kornfeld. RadioSonic eventually evolved into today's CBC Radio 3. Some individual tracks from Night Lines sessions by other bands, including Pluto, cub, Huevos Rancheros and The Smugglers, were released in 2006 on the compilation album Mint Records Presents the CBC Radio 3 Sessions.

Description Amaranthus blitum is an erect or semi-prostrate annual plant. The single or branched stem can grow to tall. The green or purplish leaves are up to long on stalks of a similar length and are arranged spirally. They are simple, roughly triangular in shape and have entire margins. The inflorescence is a spike with the tiny male and female flowers clustered together. The fruits are small globular capsules containing disc-shaped seeds. Distribution and habitat Native to the Mediterranean region, it is naturalized in other parts of the world, including much of eastern North America, much of tropical Africa, Western Europe and Japan. In Britain it was first recorded in the wild in 1771 when it appeared in Essex. It occurred more frequently in scattered locations in southern England in the 19th century but has since decreased. It is established in Guernsey and elsewhere as a casual plant, springing up on waste ground, rubbish tips and cultivated areas, probably from wool waste, coconut fibre or birdseed. Uses Although not cultivated, this plant is gathered from the wild and eaten in many parts of the world.Grubben, G.J.H. & Denton, O.A. (2004) Plant Resources of Tropical Africa 2. Vegetables. PROTA Foundation, Wageningen; Backhuys, Leiden; CTA, Wageningen. The Greeks call the Amaranthus blitum var. silvestre, (Modern Greek: ), and eat the leaves and the tender shoots cooked in steam or boiled and then served with olive oil, lemon and salt. Similarly, it is also picked as young shoots in Lebanon and cooked in olive oil, onion, chilli, and burghul, seasoned with salt and drizzled with lemon juice before eating with pita bread. It is considered a side dish and particularly popular in the north of Lebanon. Related plants The closely related Amaranthus viridis, the slender amaranth or green amaranth, is also widely eaten.

Examples and definitions  The notion of covering system was introduced by Paul Erd≈ës in the early 1930s. The following are examples of covering systems: :\\\\\\\\{0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {3}),\\\\ 1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {3}),\\\\ 2(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {3})\\\\\\\\}, and :\\\\\\\\{1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {2}),\\\\ 2(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {4}),\\\\ 4(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {8}),\\\\ 0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {8})\\\\\\\\}, and :\\\\\\\\{0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {2}),\\\\ 0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {3}),\\\\ 1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {4}), \\\\ 5(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {6}),\\\\ 7(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {12}) \\\\\\\\}. A covering system is called disjoint (or exact) if no two members overlap. A covering system is called distinct (or incongruent) if all the moduli n_i are different (and bigger than 1). A covering system is called irredundant (or minimal) if all the residue classes are required to cover the integers. The first two examples are disjoint. The third example is distinct. A system (i.e., an unordered multi- set) :\\\\\\\\{a_1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {n_1}),\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ a_k(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {n_k})\\\\\\\\} of finitely many residue classes is called an m-cover if it covers every integer at least m times, and an exact m-cover if it covers each integer exactly m times. It is known that for each m=2,3,\\\\ldots there are exact m-covers which cannot be written as a union of two covers. For example, :\\\\\\\\{1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {2});\\\\ 0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {3});\\\\ 2(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {6});\\\\ 0,4,6,8(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {10}); :1,2,4,7,10,13(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {15});\\\\ 5,11,12,22,23,29(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {30}) \\\\\\\\} is an exact 2-cover which is not a union of two covers. The first example above is an exact 1-cover (also called an exact cover). Another exact cover in common use is that of odd and even numbers, or :\\\\\\\\{0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {2}),\\\\ 1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {2})\\\\\\\\}. This is just one case of the following fact: For every positive integer modulus m, there is an exact cover: :\\\\\\\\{0(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {m}),\\\\ 1(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {m}),\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ {m-1}(\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ {m})\\\\\\\\}.  Mirsky‚ÄìNewman theorem  The Mirsky‚ÄìNewman theorem, a special case of the Herzog‚ÄìSch√∂nheim conjecture, states that there is no disjoint distinct covering system. This result was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erd≈ës and proved soon thereafter by Leon Mirsky and Donald J. Newman. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado. Primefree sequences Covering systems can be used to find primefree sequences, sequences of integers satisfying the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, such that consecutive numbers in the sequence are relatively prime but all numbers in the sequence are composite numbers. For instance, a sequence of this type found by Herbert Wilf has initial terms :a1 = 20615674205555510, a2 = 3794765361567513 . In this sequence, the positions at which the numbers in the sequence are divisible by a prime p form an arithmetic progression; for instance, the even numbers in the sequence are the numbers ai where i is congruent to 1 mod 3. The progressions divisible by different primes form a covering system, showing that every number in the sequence is divisible by at least one prime.  Boundedness of the smallest modulus  Paul Erd≈ës asked whether for any arbitrarily large N there exists an incongruent covering system the minimum of whose moduli is at least N. It is easy to construct examples where the minimum of the moduli in such a system is 2, or 3 (Erd≈ës gave an example where the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 120; a suitable cover is 0(3), 0(4), 0(5), 1(6), 1(8), 2(10), 11(12), 1(15), 14(20), 5(24), 8(30), 6(40), 58(60), 26(120) ) D. Swift gave an example where the minimum of the moduli is 4 (and the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 2880). S. L. G. Choi proved that it is possible to give an example for N = 20, and Pace P Nielsen demonstrates the existence of an example with N = 40, consisting of more than 10^{50} congruences. Erd≈ës's question was resolved in the negative by Bob Hough. Hough used the Lov√°sz local lemma to show that there is some maximum N<1016 which can be the minimum modulus on a covering system.  Systems of odd moduli  There is a famous unsolved conjecture from Erd≈ës and Selfridge: an incongruent covering system (with the minimum modulus greater than 1) whose moduli are odd, does not exist. It is known that if such a system exists with square-free moduli, the overall modulus must have at least 22 prime factors.

In warfare, ramming is a technique used in air, sea, and land combat. The term originated from battering ram, a siege weapon used to bring down fortifications by hitting it with the force of the ram's momentum, and ultimately from male sheep. Thus, in warfare, ramming refers to hitting a target by running oneself into the target. Today, hand-held battering rams are one tool among many used by law enforcement and military personnel for door breaching.Eastern Arizona Courier. Jon Johnson. 31 August 2008. Police nab stalker in women‚Äôs attic Forcible entry by criminals has been implemented using such methods as vehicles rammed into buildings. Naval warfare Bronze Roman naval ram, dated before 241 B.C. Includes winged decoration of the goddess of Victory. View from US destroyer Caron at the moment of ramming by Soviet light frigate (FFL 824) on 12 February 1988 The ram was commonly used in antiquity, and was an important part of the armament of the galleys of Imperial Rome. The ancient Greeks used their trireme vessels for ramming as well. In ancient China, rams were largely unknown, as the lack of a keel and the flat shape of the junk's bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur. The ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the American Civil War, at the Battle of Hampton Roads, when the armored Confederate warship rammed the Union frigate , sinking her almost immediately. Another significant success of the ram in wartime was at the 1866 battle of Lissa, between Italy and Austria. The Italian ironclad Re d'Italia had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian Ferdinand Max, the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral Tegetthoff. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank. During the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian ironclad repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette , sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship. During World War I, rammed and sank German submarine . This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British troop ship HMT Olympic rammed in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to scuttle and abandon ship. In World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed destroyers took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the Royal Navy from early 1943, after was dry-docked for three months following sinking in December 1942 and was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of in March 1943. rammed ; and rammed . On 29 January 1943 the Japanese submarine was rammed and wrecked by the New Zealand naval trawlers, and in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, Guadalcanal, during Operation Ke. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each. On 5 November 1942 the rammed the Soviet submarine –© 305 in the Sea of √Öland and sank it. Vetehinen was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact, Vetehinen launched a torpedo, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. Vetehinen then opened fire with its deck guns and managed to damage the Soviet submarine, which by then had started an emergency dive. The captain of Vetehinen, determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel, which at last was a success. During anti- submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water. The tactic was used by the famous British anti-submarine specialist Captain Frederic John Walker from December 1941 to the end of the war. The British destroyer (formerly USS Buchanan, supplied under Lend-Lease) was disguised as a German destroyer for the purpose of ramming the gates of the Normandie dry dock at St. Nazaire on 28 March 1942. This was to prevent the Normandie dock ever being used by the German battleship . It was the only dock on the Nazi- occupied Atlantic coast capable of repairing such a large vessel. The operation was a success, and a large explosive time bomb charge hidden in the bow of the ship exploded the next day, putting the dock out of commission for five years. On 2 August 1943, while returning from a \\"Tokyo Express\\" night reinforcement mission in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese destroyer Amagiri spotted USN PT boats at a range of about 1,000 yards. Rather than open fire‚Äîand give away their position‚Äîthe destroyer captain, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, turned to intercept and closed in the darkness at 30 knots. PT-109, commanded by Lt. John F Kennedy, was rammed and crushed by the slower, less maneuverable Japanese destroyer. Lt. Commander Gerard Roope, the captain of the G-class destroyer , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for the 1940 ramming of the German cruiser following a close-range action in bad weather off the Norwegian coast. More recent claims suggest that Admiral Hipper was actually attempting to ram Glowworm and the two ships simply collided. During the Cod Wars between Britain and Iceland, unarmed fishing trawlers found themselves opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as Royal Navy coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, ocean-going tugs and frigates to protect them and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences. In 1988, two US naval ships, destroyer and cruiser , were lightly rammed by Soviet Mirka II-class light frigate (FFL 824) and Burevestnik-class frigate Bezzavetny (FFG 811) inside contested Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, near the port of Foros. None of the ships involved suffered significant damage. On 30 March 2020, the Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguat√° rammed the cruise ship RCGS Resolute after failing to damage it with a volley of gunfire. The Naiguat√° was badly damaged from striking the strengthened hull of the Resolute, built to break ice, and she sank shortly afterwards. Air warfare Ramming in air combat is a last-ditch tactic that was used when all else had failed. The ramming pilot could use his entire aircraft as a ram or he could try to destroy the enemy's controls using the propeller or wing to chop into the enemy's tail or wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition, yet was still eager to destroy an enemy, or when his plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most ramming occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically, or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as by pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones or by single-engine aircraft against multiple-engine bombers. Defenders rammed more often than invaders. A ramming attack was not considered suicidal in the same manner as kamikaze attacks‚Äîthe ramming pilot stands a chance of surviving, though it was very risky. Sometimes, the ramming aircraft itself could survive to make a controlled landing, though most were lost due to combat damage or the pilot bailing out. Ramming was used in air warfare in the first half of the 20th century, in both World Wars and in the interwar period. In the jet age, as air combat speeds increased, ramming occurred much less frequently‚Äîthe probability of successfully executing (and surviving) a ramming attack approached zero. Ground warfare In World War II, at least one incident of a tank ramming an enemy tank has been reported. In 1944, an Irish Guards Sherman rammed a Tiger II during Operation Goodwood. Siege warfareTerrorism and vehicle ramming attacks The FBI describes \\"vehicle ramming attacks‚Äîusing modified or unmodified vehicles‚Äîagainst crowds, buildings, and other vehicles\\". Such attacks are often carried out by lone-wolf terrorists. Examples of ramming attacks as acts of political terrorism include the September 11 attacks, the 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack, the 2006 UNC SUV attack, the 2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack, and the 2008 Jerusalem vehicular attack. Ram-raiding is sometimes used by criminals to breach shops to steal cash or merchandise. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Hardesty, Von. Red Phoenix: The Rise of Soviet Air Power 1941‚Äì1945.

He is the second-best melee fighter in Section 9,Official Log 1, page 23. and is the second in command under Major Motoko Kusanagi.Midnight Animation's Batou Page. Retrieved on September 13, 2008. He is a battle-hardened cyborg special operative with a long distinguished military career and a no-nonsense attitude. Though he looks imposing, he has a tsundere personality, being known for his warm heart, sense of humor, and love for animals. Conception and creation Batou's serves as pointman whose combat specialty is \\"near combat.\\" Batou often acts as the Section 9 team's comedic relief. =Background= Batou's limbs are all prosthetic; despite the fact that exercise provides negligible benefit, Batou enjoys jogging and weightlifting as a hobby. Shirow's characterization of Batou in the manga, and indeed the other members of Section 9, is notably more light-hearted than the characterization used in Mamoru Oshii's films of the same name. His eyes, though prosthetic, often bulge comically when he is alarmed. He frequently jokes with Motoko, Togusa, the Tachikomas, and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cybercriminal named Koil Krasnov. Batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up Section 9 Chief Aramaki, demanding an explanation for Yano's death, then storms off announcing (in the English translation), \\"That‚Ä¶ Koil is dead meat!\\" Batou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make Section 9 fix the mess of another organization, such as the AI hijacking of the Jigabachi choppers in the SAC series. However, in the Ghost in the Shell movie he appears more stoic and silent than his TV and manga counterpart. Particularly in Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, Batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter.Batou: \\"So what are you saying? Having Saito do the dirty work for them makes it fine? You're not bothered at all?\\" Saito: \\"Batou! It's okay. I'm used to it.\\" (Bandai, English) - In addition, he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned. =Design= Stand Alone Complex character designer Hajime Shimomura said that Batou's image was based on the Minotaur.Official Log 1, page 84. While his name is officially romanized as \\"Batou\\", in some copies of the first film's subtitles and credits, it is spelled \\"Bateau\\" (the French word for \\"boat\\"). The name \\"Batou\\" means \\"horse\\" in Japanese and may refer to Japanese Buddhism's Batou Kannon (Horse-Headed Kannon)http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/kannon.shtml#batou with his small robotic implant eyes and long face as visual references. It also means \\"eight-headed\\" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since \\"Kusanagi\\" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology. =Relationships= Of all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to \\"speak freely\\" without permission. Appearances in media=In literature= Batou originally appeared in the manga authored by Masamune Shirow, serialized in Kodansha's \\"Young Magazine Pirate Edition\\" from 1989 to 1991. Unlike S.A.C., where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-C.I.A. operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run. In Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface, Botou's head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, \\"Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,\\" to which Batou remarks, \\"A persimmon maybe?\\" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an ultimatum: \\"If you can't be serious you can leave the room.\\" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the Puppet Master, but his request is denied. =In films=Animated film The portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. Ghost in the Shell and Innocence depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by Akio ≈åtsuka in Japanese and Richard Epcar in English in all Ghost in the Shell media with the exception of The Laughing Man and Individual Eleven OVAs where he is voiced by David Kaye in English, and Arise, where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and Christopher Sabat respectively. Batou is the central character of Innocence, which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in Innocence is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the Innocence DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a Basset Hound named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of Togusa and his family. Ishikawa, Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made. After shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched prosthetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other Ghost in the Shell incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a \\"Jericho 942,\\" based on the real Jericho 941 made by IMI but chambered for .50AE. In Innocence, he is also seen with a compact S&W; pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The Innocence prequel novel, \\"After the Long Goodbye,\\" notes that Batou's S&W; pistol is chambered for the .40 S&W; cartridge. Live action film Pilou Asb√¶k portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film. \\"The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual,\\" said Asb√¶k. \\"So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world.\\" Asb√¶k had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the Ghost in the Shell source material. \\"I didn‚Äôt have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that‚Äôs 80 percent of my personality!\\" he said.http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/01/ghost-in-the- shell-meet-the-section-9-team The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian. =In television=Stand Alone Complex series In Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film Solid State Society more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous. Batou had served in a military special forces unit and often states that he was a Ranger-trained soldier with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his prosthetic body has little to gain from exercise, Batou often lifts weights and jogs. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission. Batou is the favorite superior of the Tachikomas because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his \\"personal\\" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with organic oil, both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the Tachikomas' AI starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI. Batou is often seen driving a yellow Lancia Stratos coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In Solid State Society, Batou drives a yellow Ford GT with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that \\"his tastes had changed.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Ghost in the Shell characters Category:Anime and manga sidekicks Category:Anime and manga martial artists Category:Fictional characters from Kant≈ç Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Time travelers Category:Fictional Japan Ground Self-Defense Force personnel Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga Category:Fictional Japanese police detectives Category:Fictional Japanese police officers Category:Fictional military sergeants Category:Fictional World War IV veterans Category:Male characters in anime and manga ","title":"Batou"},{"id":"2297858","text":"People Who Fell from the Sky is a 1995 album by Mind Funk.

His most famous client was Lance Armstrong. Biography Ferrari was born in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, where he still lives. In 1978, he obtained his degree in Medicine and Surgery at the University of Ferrara. His doctoral thesis concerned the measurement of anaerobic threshold in the sport of running. Ferrari was a consultant to the Italian Track and Field Federation (FIDAL) from 1977 to 1980. He became a specialist in sports medicine at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1981. He was co-author of more than 20 papers in journals of sports physiology. He studied parameters of athletes in a variety of sports, such as track and field, cycling, swimming, skiing, and speed-skating. Subsequently, until 1983, he was the sports physician of the National Italian Biathlon team (FISI). Eventually he settled on his lifelong interest in the development of training programmes for professional cyclists. One of Ferrari's earliest successes was coaching Francesco Moser to achieve the hour record in 1984, crushing Eddy Merckx's mark by more than a mile. Initially Ferrari worked with Professor Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara, who developed testing techniques for human performance, using methods such as monitoring the heart rate during exercise and recovery. Another controversial Italian doctor, Luigi Cecchini, is their common disciple. They have shared the care for some cyclists throughout their careers. From 1984 onwards, Ferrari achieved extraordinary improvements in the fitness of many cyclists. Ferrari popularised the use of VAM, a parameter now used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed. =Cycling team doctor and increasing prominence= In 1994, Ferrari was the team doctor for Gewiss. The team had an excellent season, winning many races. In the Fl√®che Wallonne, the team realized a historic triple victory. Concerned by the domination of the Italian team, some observers pointed a finger of suspicion at the team doctor. Far from calming this controversy, Ferrari compared erythropoietin to orange juice. \\"EPO is not dangerous, it's the abuse that is. It's also dangerous to drink 10 liters of orange juice\\". This statement cost him his job as team physician. But his reputation was made, and his name thereafter was associated with use of EPO in particular. In 1995, Ferrari started his own private medical practice. =Clientele= Professional bicycle racers who were clients, in some capacity, of Ferrari include: Lance Armstrong, Michael Rogers, Alexander Vinokourov, Michele Scarponi, Denis Menchov, Giovanni Visconti, Yaroslav Popovych, Alessandro Bertolini, Gianluca Bortolami, Gianni Bugno, Mario Cipollini, Claudio Chiappucci, Roman Kreuziger, Armand de Las Cuevas, Fernando Escart√≠n, Gianni Faresin, Giorgio Furlan, Ivan Gotti, Andreas Kappes, Kevin Livingston, Eddy Mazzoleni, Axel Merckx, Thomas Dekker, Abraham Olano, Daniele Pontoni, Tony Rominger, Paolo Savoldelli, Filippo Simeoni, Pavel Tonkov, Enrico Zaina and Beat Zberg. Perhaps the most famous athlete to have been coached or advised by Ferrari is Lance Armstrong. Ferrari claims they were introduced to each other by Eddy Merckx in 1995. Earlier that year, Armstrong had begun doping. (at 5m20sec) Ferrari was involved with the US Postal Service Cycling Team until October 2004, helping Armstrong train during several of his seven consecutive Tour de France victories. Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's teammate who later confessed to doping, worked with Ferrari for one year, according to his own account in a television interview. =Sporting fraud trial= In October 2004, Ferrari was sentenced to one-year prison (suspended) and a fine of 900 euros, for sporting fraud and abusive exercise of the profession of pharmacist. Ferrari's conviction in Italian court was based partly on testimony from Italian bicycle racer Filippo Simeoni. Admitting he had been doped since 1993, Simeoni told how he became affiliated with Ferrari in 1996. Simeoni testified that, in addition to a prescription of EPO hormone, \\"we spoke about Andriol (testosterone), which I was to use after hard training sessions, with the aim of increasing my muscular power. Dr. Ferrari recommended I use Emagel the morning before controls, and another product to decrease my hematocrit.\\" Ferrari argued, in his defense: \\"Andriol is easily detectable for several days in a normal urine test, so, it is impossible that I suggested he take one Andriol 20 hours before another race.\\" Lance Armstrong responded to Ferrari's guilty verdict for malpractice in the Italian Court case: :\\"I was disappointed to learn of the Italian court's judgment against Dr. Michele Ferrari. Dr. Ferrari has been a longtime friend and trusted adviser to me and the USPS team, during which time he never suggested, prescribed or provided me with any performance-enhancing drugs... However, I have always said that I have zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs. As a result of today's developments, the USPS team and I have suspended our professional affiliation with Dr. Ferrari as we await the release of the full verdict...\\" Ferrari then announced his intention to appeal his sentence. Ferrari was acquitted of all charges against him on May 27, 2006, because, according to the court, \\"the facts do not exist\\" to support the charges. =2012 USADA indictment and lifetime ban= On 13 June 2012, Ferrari was officially charged by USADA with administration and trafficking of prohibited substances. As Ferrari did not formally contest this indictment, he was issued a lifetime ban from professional sport in July 2012. In December 2012, Ferrari still protested his innocence in an interview with Al Jazeera. He notably stated about Lance Armstrong in that interview: ‚ÄúSo, either he was clean ‚Äì and in my opinion, he was clean and he says he was clean ‚Äì or the tests are not powerful,‚Äù Ferrari added, before laughing: ‚ÄúOr the UCI was corrupt.‚Äù In January 2013, after Lance Armstrong had confessed to using PEDs, Ferrari claimed on his blog that the cyclist could have achieved similar blood values and performance with altitude training. =2013 revelation= In November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC). AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999‚Äì2001. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum one day before Armstrong was scheduled to give a deposition under oath. In written testimony for the suit, Armstrong admitted under oath that Ferrari had been one of four individuals who had supplied him with PEDs during his cycling career.

A Roman Senator during the waning days of the Roman Republic, Decius solves mysteries, while at the same time working his way steadily up the cursus honorum. The SPQR series takes the form of Decius's memoirs, written during the reign of Augustus Caesar, when he has outlived all his friends and enemies, and no longer cares whom he offends or what anyone might do to him. Character history Born in 95 BC into the prominent Caecilii Metelli family, a (fictional) nephew of Metellus Pius, Decius began his career serving as a military legate and scout commander, in the civil war against Quintus Sertorius, during which he receives a scar from an Iberian spear. He holds several political and judicial offices in the turbulent days leading up to the Roman Civil War. He becomes an ally of Cicero, a reluctant ally of Cato the Younger, a close friend of Titus Annius Milo, and a mortal enemy of Publius Clodius Pulcher. He later marries Julia, the (fictional) niece of Julius Caesar (by a lucky accident, the political marriage desired by his family coincides with his and Julia's own wishes). Immediately before the Civil War, he is touring southern Italy as praetor peregrinus (a sort of roving magistrate who adjudicates cases related to resident non-citizens). The volume most recently published in English, The Year of Confusion, takes place the year before Caesar's assassination, while Caesar is exercising his dictatorship in Rome. Decius is the sole surviving member of his family (or at least the only member still in the Senate), since his family connection with Caesar has separated him from the rest of his family, who have been disgraced and destroyed for their support of Pompey. Decius's activities between the previous novel, Oracle of the Dead and the events of Confusion are not detailed in the novels (except for a reference at the end of the fourth, The Temple of the Muses, that he was in Egypt with Caesar during his famous mediation between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra). By the time of his memoirs' writing, he is an elderly senator during the reign of Augustus, whom he despises so much that he refuses to refer to him except as \\"The First Citizen,\\" one of his more innocuous titles. Augustus leaves Decius alone, knowing him to be powerless, and even occasionally calls on him to solve a mystery (the subject matter of some of the short stories). It is confirmed in Oracle that Julia, his wife, has predeceased him. Their inability to conceive a child is a source of tension in their marriage during the novels, but, according to the short story \\"The Will\\", he has at least one grandson, indicating that he and Julia had at least one child before she died. After Decius solves the murder of Julia the Elder's lover in 22 BC, clearing Julia of all suspicion, Augustus offers him the position of Rex Sacrorum. Decius declines, declaring that he views exile on an unknown island as being preferable. His exploits after that are unknown. Cursus Honorum *90/91 BC: Decius is born. *Scout commander in the Spanish army of his uncle Metellus Pius, against Sertorius. *SPQR I: The King's Gambit: Decius uncovers a plot to subvert Lucullus's command in the East, on the eve of his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus.

It was developed in 1943 by Hans Mueller. In this technique, the effect of a particular optical element is represented by a Mueller matrix‚Äîa 4√ó4 matrix that is an overlapping generalization of the Jones matrix. Introduction Disregarding coherent wave superposition, any fully polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized state of light can be represented by a Stokes vector ; and any optical element can be represented by a Mueller matrix (M). If a beam of light is initially in the state \\\\vec{S}_i and then passes through an optical element M and comes out in a state \\\\vec{S}_o, then it is written : \\\\vec{S}_o = \\\\mathrm{M} \\\\vec{S}_i \\\\ . If a beam of light passes through optical element M1 followed by M2 then M3 it is written : \\\\vec{S}_o = \\\\mathrm{M}_3 \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{M}_2 \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{M}_1 \\\\vec{S}_i\\\\right) \\\\right) given that matrix multiplication is associative it can be written : \\\\vec{S}_o = \\\\mathrm{M}_3 \\\\mathrm{M}_2 \\\\mathrm{M}_1 \\\\vec{S}_i \\\\ . Matrix multiplication is not commutative, so in general : \\\\mathrm{M}_3 \\\\mathrm{M}_2 \\\\mathrm{M}_1 \\\\vec{S}_i e \\\\mathrm{M}_1 \\\\mathrm{M}_2 \\\\mathrm{M}_3 \\\\vec{S}_i \\\\ . Mueller vs. Jones calculi With disregard for coherence, light which is unpolarized or partially polarized must be treated using the Mueller calculus, while fully polarized light can be treated with either the Mueller calculus or the simpler Jones calculus. Many problems involving coherent light (such as from a laser) must be treated with Jones calculus, however, because it works directly with the electric field of the light rather than with its intensity or power, and thereby retains information about the phase of the waves. More specifically, the following can be said about Mueller matrices and Jones matrices: > Stokes vectors and Mueller matrices operate on intensities and their > differences, i.e. incoherent superpositions of light; they are not adequate > to describe either interference or diffraction effects. ... Any Jones matrix > [J] can be transformed into the corresponding Mueller‚ÄìJones matrix, M, using > the following relation:* : \\\\mathrm{M = A(J \\\\otimes J^*)A^{-1}}, where * > indicates the complex conjugate [sic], [A is:] :\\\\mathrm{A} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} > 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -i & i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\end{pmatrix} and ‚äó is the tensor (Kronecker) product. ... While the Jones > matrix has eight independent parameters [two Cartesian or polar components > for each of the four complex values in the 2-by-2 matrix], the absolute > phase information is lost in the [equation above], leading to only seven > independent matrix elements for a Mueller matrix derived from a Jones > matrix.

He was instrumental in the post-war capture of former Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann and also played an essential role in starting the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. Life and work Bauer was born in Stuttgart, to Jewish parents, Ella (Hirsch) and Ludwig Bauer. He attended Eberhard-Ludwigs- Gymnasium and studied business and law at the Universities of Heidelberg, Munich and T√ºbingen. In 1928, after receiving his PhD in law (at 25, the youngest Doktor der Rechte [Jur.Dr.] in Germany), Bauer became an assessor judge in the Stuttgart local district court. By 1920, he already had joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). In the early 1930s, Bauer was, together with Kurt Schumacher, one of the leaders of the SPD's Reichsbanner defense league in Stuttgart. In May 1933, soon after the Nazi seizure of power, a plan to organize a general strike against the Nazis in the Stuttgart region failed, and Schumacher and Bauer were arrested with others and taken to Heuberg concentration camp. The more prominent and older Schumacher, who had been an outspoken opponent of the Nazis as an SPD deputy in the Reichstag, remained in concentration camps (which destroyed his health) until the end of World War II, whereas the young and largely unknown Bauer was released. A short time later Bauer, like most Jews, was dismissed from his civil service position. In 1935, Bauer emigrated to Denmark. After the German occupation, the Danish authorities revoked his residence permit in April 1940 and interned him in a camp for three months. In October 1942, he fled to Sweden after the Danish government resigned and the Nazis declared martial law, which endangered the Jewish population in Denmark. The fact that Bauer was a homosexual ‚Äì something he was careful to keep to himself ‚Äì placed him in even further peril should he remain in Germany or in Nazi-occupied Denmark. To protect himself, he formally married the Danish kindergarten teacher Anna Maria Petersen, in June 1943. In Sweden, Bauer founded, along with Willy Brandt, the periodical Sozialistische Trib√ºne (). Bauer returned to Germany in 1949, as the postwar Federal Republic (West Germany) was being established, and once more entered the civil service in the justice system. At first he became director of the district courts, and later the equivalent of a U.S. district attorney, in Braunschweig. In 1956, he was appointed the district attorney in Hessen, based in Frankfurt. Bauer held this position until his death in 1968. In 1957, Bauer relayed information about the whereabouts in Argentina of fugitive Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann to Israeli Intelligence (the Mossad) that allowed Eichmann to be captured. Bauer thus was instrumental in bringing him to trial in Israel in 1960. Bauer also was active in the postwar efforts to obtain justice and compensation for victims of the Nazi regime. In 1958, he succeeded in getting a class action lawsuit certified, consolidating numerous individual claims in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, which opened in 1963. In 1968, working with German journalist Gerhard Szczesny, Bauer founded the Humanist Union, a human- rights organization. After Bauer's death, the Union donated money to endow the Fritz Bauer Prize. Another organization, the Fritz Bauer Institute, founded in 1995, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to civil rights that focuses on history and the effects of the Holocaust. Fritz Bauer's work contributed to the creation of an independent, democratic justice system in West Germany, as well as to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the reform of the criminal law and penal systems. Within the postwar German justice system, Bauer was a controversial figure due to his political engagements. He once said, \\"In the justice system, I live as in exile.\\" Bauer died in Frankfurt am Main, aged 64. He was found drowned in his bathtub. A post mortem examination found that he had taken alcohol and sleeping tablets. Works * Die Kriegsverbrecher vor Gericht (\\"War Criminals in Court\\"), with a postscript by Hans Felix Pfenninger.

A subset Y of an algebraic structure X is said to exhibit closure with a twist if for every two elements : y_1, y_2 \\\\in Y there exists an automorphism \\\\phi of X and an element y_3 \\\\in Y such that : y_1 \\\\cdot y_2 = \\\\phi(y_3) where \\"\\\\cdot\\" is notation for an operation on X preserved by \\\\phi. Two examples of algebraic structures which exhibit closure with a twist are the cwatset and the generalized cwatset, or GC-set. Cwatset In mathematics, a cwatset is a set of bitstrings, all of the same length, which is closed with a twist. If each string in a cwatset, C, say, is of length n, then C will be a subset of \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n. Thus, two strings in C are added by adding the bits in the strings modulo 2 (that is, addition without carry, or exclusive disjunction). The symmetric group on n letters, \\\\text{Sym}(n), acts on \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n by bit permutation: :::p((c_1, \\\\ldots, c_n)) = (c_{p(1)}, \\\\ldots, c_{p(n)}), where c = (c_1, \\\\ldots, c_n) is an element of \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n and p is an element of \\\\text{Sym}(n). Closure with a twist now means that for each element c in C, there exists some permutation p_c such that, when you add c to an arbitrary element e in the cwatset and then apply the permutation, the result will also be an element of C. That is, denoting addition without carry by +, C will be a cwatset if and only if :::\\\\forall c\\\\in C : \\\\exists p_c\\\\in \\\\text{Sym}(n) : \\\\forall e\\\\in C : p_c(e+c) \\\\in C. This condition can also be written as :::\\\\forall c\\\\in C : \\\\exists p_c\\\\in \\\\text{Sym}(n) : p_c(C+c)=C. =Examples= *All subgroups of \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n -- that is, nonempty subsets of \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n which are closed under addition-without-carry -- are trivially cwatsets, since we can choose each permutation pc to be the identity permutation. *An example of a cwatset which is not a group is :F = {000,110,101}. To demonstrate that F is a cwatset, observe that : F + 000 = F. : F + 110 = {110,000,011}, which is F with the first two bits of each string transposed. : F + 101 = {101,011,000}, which is the same as F after exchanging the first and third bits in each string. *A matrix representation of a cwatset is formed by writing its words as the rows of a 0-1 matrix. For instance a matrix representation of F is given by ::: F = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. To see that F is a cwatset using this notation, note that ::: F + 000 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = F^{id}=F^{(2,3)_R(2,3)_C}. ::: F + 110 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,2)_R(1,2)_C}=F^{(1,2,3)_R(1,2,3)_C}. ::: F + 101 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = F^{(1,3)_R(1,3)_C}=F^{(1,3,2)_R(1,3,2)_C}. where \\\\pi_R and \\\\sigma_C denote permutations of the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively, expressed in cycle notation. *For any n \\\\geq 3 another example of a cwatset is K_n , which has n-by-n matrix representation ::: K_n = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & \\\\vdots & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Note that for n = 3, K_3=F. *An example of a nongroup cwatset with a rectangular matrix representation is ::: W = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. =Properties= Let C \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^n be a cwatset. * The degree of C is equal to the exponent n. * The order of C, denoted by C, is the set cardinality of C. * There is a necessary condition on the order of a cwatset in terms of its degree, which is analogous to Lagrange's Theorem in group theory. To wit, Theorem. If C is a cwatset of degree n and order m, then m divides 2^n!. The divisibility condition is necessary but not sufficient. For example there does not exist a cwatset of degree 5 and order 15. Generalized cwatset In mathematics, a generalized cwatset (GC-set) is an algebraic structure generalizing the notion of closure with a twist, the defining characteristic of the cwatset. = Definitions = A subset H of a group G is a GC-set if for each h\\\\in H, there exists a \\\\phi_h\\\\in\\\\text{Aut}(G) such that \\\\phi_h(h) \\\\cdot H = \\\\phi_h(H). Furthermore, a GC-set H ‚äÜ G is a cyclic GC-set if there exists an h\\\\in H and a \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\text{Aut}(G) such that H = {h_1, h_2, ...} where h_1 = h and h_n = h_1 \\\\cdot \\\\phi(h_{n-1}) for all n > 1. = Examples = *Any cwatset is a GC-set, since C + c = \\\\pi(C) implies that \\\\pi^{-1}(c) + C = \\\\pi^{-1}(C). *Any group is a GC-set, satisfying the definition with the identity automorphism. *A non-trivial example of a GC-set is H = {0, 2} where G = Z_{10}. *A nonexample showing that the definition is not trivial for subsets of Z_2^n is H = {000, 100, 010, 001, 110}. = Properties = *A GC-set H ‚äÜ G always contains the identity element of G. *The direct product of GC-sets is again a GC-set. *A subset H ‚äÜ G is a GC-set if and only if it is the projection of a subgroup of Aut(G)‚ãâG, the semi-direct product of Aut(G) and G. *As a consequence of the previous property, GC-sets have an analogue of Lagrange's Theorem: The order of a GC-set divides the order of Aut(G)‚ãâG. *If a GC-set H has the same order as the subgroup of Aut(G)‚ãâG of which it is the projection then for each prime power p^{q} which divides the order of H, H contains sub-GC-sets of orders p,p^{2},...,p^{q}. (Analogue of the first Sylow Theorem) *A GC-set is cyclic if and only if it is the projection of a cyclic subgroup of Aut(G)‚ãâG.

Pushkar Lake is surrounded by 52 bathing ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, especially around Kartik Poornima (October‚ÄìNovember) when the Pushkar Fair is held. A dip in the sacred lake is believed to cleanse sins and cure skin diseases. Over 500 Hindu temples are situated around the lake precincts. Tourism and deforestation in the surroundings have taken a heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme. Geography Pushkar city and lake, viewed from hill above Pushkar Lake around which the Pushkar town has developed is in the Ajmer district in the state of Rajasthan, India amidst the Aravalli range of hills. The mountain range known as Nag Parbat (\\"snake mountain\\") separates the lake from the city of Ajmer. The valley is formed between the two parallel ranges of the Aravalli hills (in elevation range of running south-west to north-east. Situated at northwest from Ajmer, the artificial Pushkar Lake created by building a dam is surrounded by deserts and hills on all three sides.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 196 The lake is categorized as a \\"Sacred Lake\\" under the list of \\"Classification of Lakes in India\\". The soil and topography in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use pattern in the Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30% of the area under shifting sand dunes, 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 201 =Climate= The region experiences semi-arid climatic conditions with dry and hot summers and cool winters. The summer months of May and June are the hottest, with a maximum temperature of around . During the winter months, the maximum mean temperature is in the range of . Rain mainly occurs during a short spell of two months during July and August. The recorded average rainfall is in the range of . Rainfall is also recorded some times during winter months of January and February. From April to September, strong winds blowing in the southwest to northeast direction add to the formation of sand dunes. =Hydrology= Foot bridge of arches to cross the inlet channel to the lake during parikrama of ghats and temples on ghats The Pushkar Lake drains a catchment of the Aravalli hills covering an area of . The lake has a water surface area of . It is a perennial lake sourced by the monsoon rainfall over the catchment. The depth of water in the lake varies from season to season from . The total storage capacity of the lake is 0.79 million cubic metres (1.03 million cu yd). As the lake periphery is encircled by 52 ghats of various sizes, the surface water flow from the catchment into the lake is channeled through a series of arches under a footbridge, long at the southern end. The footbridge facilitates the parikrama (circumambulation) that is performed by pilgrims around the lake covering all the 52 ghats (covers an area of ).City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 216 Flora and fauna Pushkar Lake, when full, is rich in fish and other aquatic life. The depth of the lake has substantially shrunk - to less than from a maximum of - resulting in the death of large fish weighing , caused due to the viscous water and the lack of oxygen for the fish to survive. Since the region where the lake and its valley is situated is arid, the flora and fauna recorded relate to desert plants, including cactus and thorny bushes, as well as desert animals like camels and cattle. Man-eating crocodiles used to be a menace in the Puskhar Lake, resulting in the deaths of people. Pilgrims were aware of this fact, yet many considered it as lucky to be eaten by crocodiles. The crocodiles were caught with nets by the British and shifted to a nearby reservoir. History An artist's view of Pushkar Lake in late 18th century during British rule Pushkar Lake's history dates back to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The inscriptions found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route. In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveller Fa Xian made reference to the number of visitors to Pushkar Lake. A story tells of a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lakeshore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was astonished to see that the Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems. The creation of Pushkar Lake, as an artificial lake, is also credited to the 12th century when a dam was built across the headwaters of the Luni River. The 10th Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh (1666‚Äì1708), is said to have recited the Sikh sacred text Guru Granth Sahib on the banks of the lake. During the Mughal rule, there was a short break in the lake's importance due to the levy of a pilgrim tax and a ban on religious processions. In 1615‚Äì16, the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1569‚Äì1627) built his hunting lodge (seen now in total ruins) on the shores of the Pushkar Lake to celebrate his victory over the local Rajput Rana (king). He came to this lodge 16 times for hunting during his stay in Ajmer, about from Pushkar. This act violated the local tradition of not killing any animals in the precincts of the sacred lake. He also committed an idolatrous act by breaking the image of Varaha - the boar Avatar of the god Vishnu, as it resembled a pig and symbolically hurt Islamic sensitivity. Thereafter, Jahangir's grandson emperor Aurangzeb (1618‚Äì1707) destroyed and desecrated several temples, which were later rebuilt. However, during the rule of Jahangir's father, Emperor Akbar (1542‚Äì1605), there was a revival of not only the lake but also the Ajmer's Dargah dedicated to sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti, of whom Akbar was a devout follower. The Rajput rulers of Amber, Bundi, Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts to restore the importance of the lake and its surrounding temples. Credits given for modern additions to the building of ghats and the renovation/construction of temples go to Maharaja Man Singh I of Amber for the Raj Ghat and Man temple; Maha Rana Pratap for the Varaha temple; Daulat Rao Scindia for Kot Tirth Ghat, the Marathas-Anaji Scindia to the Koteshwar Mahadev temple and Govind Rao, the Maratha governor of Ajmer for Shiva Ghat; to the British rule for combining the religious pilgrimage with a cattle fair to generate taxes for improving the lake and its surroundings; and gifting of the Jaipur Ghat and the Main Palace on the ghat in 1956 by the Maharaja of Jaipur.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar pp. 195-196 Religious significance There are various legends from Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata and the Puranic scriptures which mention the Pushkar Lake and the town of Pushkar surrounding it. Early morning view of the ghats at the Pushkar Lake. According to the Hindu scripture Padma Purana, Brahma saw the demon Vajranabha (Vajranash in another version) trying to kill his children and harassing people. He immediately slew the demon with his weapon, the lotus-flower. In this process, the lotus petals fell on the ground at three places, where springs emerged creating three lakes: the Pushkar Lake or Jyeshta Pushkar (greatest or first Pushkar), the Madya Pushkar (middle Pushkar) Lake, and Kanishta Pushkar (lowest or youngest Pushkar) lake. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the flower (\\"pushpa\\") fell from Brahma's hand (\\"kar\\") as \\"Pushkar\\".City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 195 It is also said that the sacred Sarasvati River emerged at Pushkar as five streams. The three lakes were assigned their presiding deities as the Hindu Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, respectively. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the lotus fell as 'Pushkar'. Brahma then decided to perform a yagna at the place, at the main Pushkar Lake. However, his wife Savitri (called Sarasvati in some versions) could not be present at the designated time to perform the essential part of the yagna. Brahma, therefore, married a Gujjar,a dominant agricultural race named Gayatri and completed the yagna with his new consort sitting beside him. However, when Savitri finally arrived at the venue, she found Gayatri sitting next to Brahma in her rightful place. Agitated, she cursed Brahma that he would be worshipped only in Pushkar. As a result of this, yagna performed in the presence of all the gods, it is said that a dip in the lake created at this place is credited with holiness, assuring salvation from all sins. It is now one of the five holiest centres of pilgrimage for Hindus. Ramayana and Mahabharata refer to Pushkar Lake as Adi Tirtha, or the \\"original sacred water-body\\". The famous Sanskrit poet and play-writer Kalidasa also referred to this lake in his poem Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam. The Ramayana mentions that Vishwamitra performed penance at Pushkar Lake for a thousand years. In spite of Brahma appearing before him and granting him the higher status of a rishi instead of a royal-sage (rajarishi), Vishwamitra continued his penance, but, the celestial nymph apsara, Menaka came to the lake to take a bath. Vishwamitra was enamoured by her beauty and they decided to live together in pursuit of pleasure for ten years. Then, Vishwamitra realized that his main activity of penance was disturbed. He, therefore, took leave of Menaka and went away to the north to continue his meditation. Vishwamitra was also described as building the Brahma temple at Pushkar after Brahma's yagna. Mahabharata mentions that Pushkar is a holy place of the god Vishnu, considered as the Adi Tirtha where millions of tirthas united during sunrise and sunset, and visiting the lake and taking a holy bath in the lake would wash off all sins. Morning view of one of the ghats on the lake According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes collectively called Panch-Sarovar ('Sarovar' means \\"lake\\"). Namely, Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar; hence, Pushkar is considered one of the most sacred places in India. It is also the belief of devotees that a dip in the waters of the lake on Kartik Poornima would equal the benefits that would accrue by performing yagnas (fire-sacrifices) for several centuries. Pushkar is often called \\"Tirtha-Raj\\" - the king of pilgrimage sites related to water-bodies. The scriptures also mention that doing parikrama (circumambulation) of the three lakes (the main Pushkar, Madya Pushkar where there is a Hanuman temple and an old Banyan tree, and Kanistha Pushkar where a Krishna temple exists), which cover a distance of , during the Kartik Poornima day would be highly auspicious. International Business Times has identified Pushkar as one of the ten most religious places in the world and one of the five sacred pilgrimage places for the Hindus, in India. Cultural attractions The Brahma temple at Pushkar Pushkar Lake and its precincts offer a plethora of monuments of national importance, such as the Pushkar city, the Brahma temple at Pushkar and the ghats on the periphery of the lakes. The lake is the central divine theme for the popularity of all the monuments seen in the town and the fairs held here. =Pushkar city= Pushkar city, with a population of 14,791 at the 2001 census, is one of the oldest cities in India. The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a darshan (sight) of god Vishnu. Thus, its uniqueness lies in the fact of its historic-religious-cultural background, and as a result it attracts approximately 100,000 visitors every month, apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair. However, Pushkar Lake is central to its sustenance as a religious centre.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar pp. 199, 208 The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16.12 million (said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan), out of which the foreign tourists were about 63,000.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar pp. 217-218 =Temples= Apart from the sacred Lake, Pushkar is said to have over 500 temples (80 are large and the rest are small); of these many old temples were destroyed or desecrated by Muslim depredations during Aurangzeb's rule (1658‚Äì1707) but were re-built subsequently. The most important of these is the Brahma temple. Though the current structure dates to the 14th century, the original temple is believed to be 2000 years old. Pushkar is often described in the scriptures as the only Brahma temple in the world, owing to the curse of Savitri, but also as the \\"King of the sacred places of the Hindus\\". Although now the Pushkar temple does not remain the only Brahma temple, it is still one of very few existing temples dedicated to Brahma in India as well as the most prominent. Hindu pilgrims, including holy men and sages visit this temple after taking a ceremonial sacred bath in the Pushkar Lake. Other notable temples around the lake include Varaha temple - dedicated to Varaha (the boar incarnation of god Vishnu), Savitri temple and Gayatri temple, dedicated to the consorts of Brahma. =Ghats= Ghats (stone steps laid on a gradual bank slope to descend to the lake edge) at Pushkar are integral to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats on the periphery of the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats, as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument), have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further works as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar pp. 209-212 While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (Varaha). Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display. A coinage known as \\"Puskar Passport\\" used by visitors to the lake and the ghats denotes the red thread that is tied on the wrists of pilgrims by the priests (for a dakshina - an unspecified fee). This indicates that the pilgrim has visited Pushkar Lake and is usually not approached by priests again for further rites and fees. Pushkar Fair The devotees are taking a holy dip at Pushkar lake on the occasion of Kartik Purnima on 24 November 2007 Pushkar Lake and its precincts become very heavily populated during the annual Pushkar Fair or Pushkar mela, which has both a religious as well as an economic aspect. During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima ‚Äì the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October‚ÄìNovember), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 208 The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels. In this fair held on the banks of the lake, camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake. Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes. The fair on Kartik Poornima, the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake. It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan.City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 219 The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances, music, camel races, and the cattle fair. The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair. This event is held between the Rajasthanis and foreigners; locals invariably win the event. Status and conservation issues The natural environment of Pushkar Lake and its precincts has become increasingly degraded in the last few decades. The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the deforestation of the surrounding area. The critical issues related to the conservation of the lake have been identified as:City Development Plan for Ajmer and Pushkar p. 232 * Siltation during the rainy season due to soil erosion of the denuded hills and inappropriate agricultural practices flowing through the three feeder streams namely, the Gomukh, the Nag Pahar and Savitri. * Shifting sand dunes from hills and surrounding areas causing a rise of the bed level of the lake. * Upstream interception by farmers through check dams for farming practices causing reduction in inflows. This reduction is reflected in the full reservoir level of not being achieved during most years, resulting in pilgrim displeasure and the reduction in maximum depth of the lake, reported now as only . * Large inflow of sewage from the ghats and the surrounding habitation has caused serious water pollution. * Alarming rate of fall in groundwater level has occurred in the vicinity of the lake due to high extraction for various uses. In recent years, storage in the Pushkar Lake has been reduced alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the situation became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks near one of the upper ghats, fed by tube wells from groundwater sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake. =Water quality issues= The lake does not meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high concentration of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation. =Restoration works= Pushkar Lake being dredged to fight silting To supplement water supply to the lake, even as early as in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water supply to the lake. However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake on a list of five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased. Development plans are under various stages of implementation to address the critical issues related to the lake. They aim to improve water quality, increase water storage capacity, prevent encroachment of the lake periphery, improve the ambiance around the lake, as well as to introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes. Sewage outfalls into the lake are proposed to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders into the lake and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation in the bed of feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation to reduce the risk of death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.

In 1991, Congress set aside 76 miles (120 km) for preservation under the management of the National Park Service with assistance from the local Niobrara Council. Several \\"outstandingly remarkable values\\" have been designated to be protected along the Niobrara National Scenic River, including: Fish and Wildlife, Scenery, Fossil Resources, Geology, and Recreation. The river was designated by Backpacker magazine as one of the 10 best rivers for canoeing in the United States. Along the National Scenic River are numerous waterfalls that empty into the river from the surrounding cliff and canyon walls; the highest one is Smith Falls, which drops almost 63 feet (19 m) into the river valley. There are short sections of Class I and II rapids on the river, and several locations further downstream require a portage around the rapids. The westernmost 26 miles (40 km) of the Scenic River section, from the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge (just east of Valentine) to the Rocky Ford portage, offer outstanding canoeing, kayaking, and tubing opportunities. Although the remainder of the river can be paddled, access is limited by private landholder permission. Around 75,000 people visit the river annually, with the months of June through August being the busiest. Water levels decline slightly in late summer, but the river can still be enjoyed by canoe, kayak, and inner tube. To reach the first public access on the Scenic River section, drive northeast of Valentine on Nebraska Highway 12 until the sign for the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge put-in. Considered an extraordinary example of a Great Plains river, the Niobrara is home to over 500 plant species many at or beyond their usual range, including many not otherwise naturally found within several hundred miles. These species include birch, ponderosa pine and a rare hybrid aspen (quaking X bigtooth). Species from six different vegetation communities can be found in proximity. Northern boreal forest types occur on north facing slopes where shade and abundant ground water create cooler microclimates. Species growing here include paper birch, aspen, ferns and club mosses. Rocky Mountain forest plants include ponderosa pine, serviceberry, and horizontal juniper. Eastern deciduous forests grow on the moist bottom lands and islands of the Niobrara. They include American elm, basswood, cottonwood, green ash, bur oak, hackberry and box elder. Three types of prairie are found in the river valley, displaying a botanical transition between among the eastern tallgrass prairie, the Sandhills mixed-grass prairie, and Northern Mixed-grass prairie. Mule deer, beaver, mink, pronghorn, river otter and even bison can be found in the area. Approximately 300 bison and a few dozen elk are protected in the 19,000 acre (77 km2) Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge, which is located along the river. In the Niobrara river, minnows such as sand shiners, red shiners and flathead chubs search for their food of aquatic insects near streambank margins. Larger fish, such as rainbow and brown trout, prefer cooler, clear water where springbranch canyon tributaries enter the river. Channel catfish, a popular game fish, prefer deeper waters or cover during the day and feed at night in the riffles. Softshell, snapping or painted turtles may be found sunning on logs in summer. The scenic river is spanned by 15 bridges, including six which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The Bridges of the Niobrara covers five NRHP-listed bridges; County Line Bridge (Cherry County, Nebraska) is newly listed in 2018.

Her youthful and lively interpretations made her an ideal interpreter of roles such as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos and Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro. Early life She was born Hulda Geiringer in Vienna, and studied singing with Otto Iro, piano with Maria Wetzelsberger, and dancing at the Vienna Music Academy. She debuted, as Hulda Gerin, in 1937 in Benatzky's operetta Herzen im Schnee at the Vienna Volksoper. Her operatic debut came in 1939, when she sang Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro at the Zurich Opera. In 1941, the famous conductor Clemens Krauss engaged her for the Munich State Opera, where she sang with much success. From this time she used Hilde G√ºden as her stage name. However, she had some Jewish ancestry, and this forced her to leave Germany under the Nazis. Rumour has it that she was almost arrested by the Gestapo in Munich, but she had by then obtained a fake passport showing that she was a Roman Catholic Polish woman and could avoid arrest. Post-war career In Italy, Tullio Serafin invited her to sing Sophie (Der Rosenkavalier) in Rome and Florence. From then on, she gained great successes in Paris, Milan, London, Venice, Glyndebourne, and other major cities. She made her debut at Salzburg Festival in 1946 by singing Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni in 1946. In 1947, she started a long membership with the Vienna Staatsoper, where she was still of the greatest stars up to 1973. In December 1951, she debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as Gilda in Rigoletto. In 1953, she sang Ann Trulove in the first U.S. performance of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress at the Metropolitan Opera. From late 1950s, she moved from light roles to lyric ones in the same operas; from Susanna to Countess Almaviva (Le nozze di Figaro), from Zerlina to Donna Elvira (Don Giovanni), from Despina to Fiordiligi (Cos√¨ fan tutte), from Nannetta to Alice Ford (Falstaff), and from Musetta to Mimi (La boh√®me). She was also praised for her performances of Violetta in La traviata, Marguerite in Faust, and Mica√´la in Carmen. She was a most versatile and accomplished singer. Besides her usual Mozart and Richard Strauss, she was also an ideal operetta singer. Her Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus is considered one of her best roles. In the bel canto repertoire, she became a famous Gilda in Rigoletto and Adina in L'elisir d'amore. She was also noted for her Lieder and oratorio work. She died, aged 71, in Klosterneuburg. Recordings During the 1950s and 1960s, Hilde Gueden made dozens of recordings with the best artists of her generation, especially for the Decca/London label.

Other uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda. It is taken by mouth, often in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hydroxychloroquine is being studied to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äë19), but all clinical trials conducted during 2020 found it is ineffective and may cause dangerous side effects. Common side effects may include vomiting, headache, changes in vision, and muscle weakness. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, vision problems, and heart problems. Although all risk cannot be excluded, it remains a treatment for rheumatic disease during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is in the antimalarial and 4-aminoquinoline families of medication. Hydroxychloroquine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 128th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than five million prescriptions. The speculative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID‚Äë19 threatens its availability for people with established indications. Medical uses Hydroxychloroquine treats rheumatic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and porphyria cutanea tarda, and certain infections such as Q fever and certain types of malaria. It is considered the first-line treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain types of malaria, resistant strains, and complicated cases require different or additional medication. It is widely used to treat primary Sj√∂gren syndrome but does not appear to be effective. Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of post-Lyme arthritis. It may have both an anti-spirochete activity and an anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Contraindications The drug label advises that hydroxychloroquine should not be prescribed to individuals with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. There are several other contraindications, and caution is required if the person considered for treatment has certain heart conditions, diabetes, or psoriasis. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects are nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Other common adverse effects include itching and headache. The most serious adverse effects affect the eye, with dose-related retinopathy as a concern even after hydroxychloroquine use is discontinued. Serious reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In rare situations, hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in cases of serious skin reactions such as Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Reported blood abnormalities with its use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis. For short- term treatment of acute malaria, adverse effects can include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heart problems, reduced appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Other adverse effects noted with short-term use of Hydroxychloroquine include low blood sugar and QT interval prolongation. Idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. For prolonged treatment of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, adverse effects include the acute symptoms, plus altered eye pigmentation, acne, anemia, bleaching of hair, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, cardiomyopathy, convulsions, vision difficulties, diminished reflexes, emotional changes, excessive coloring of the skin, hearing loss, hives, itching, liver problems or liver failure, loss of hair, muscle paralysis, weakness or atrophy, nightmares, psoriasis, reading difficulties, tinnitus, skin inflammation and scaling, skin rash, vertigo, weight loss, and occasionally urinary incontinence. Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both psoriasis and porphyria. Children may be especially vulnerable to developing adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine. =Eyes= One of the most serious side effects is retinopathy (generally with chronic use). People taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of macular toxicity, whereas the risk begins to increase when a person takes the medication over five years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000 grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be computed from a person's height and weight. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the cornea and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine. The macular changes are potentially serious. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a \\"bull's eye\\" macular lesion which is absent in early involvement.  Overdose  Overdoses of hydroxychloroquine are extremely rare, but extremely toxic. Eight people are known to have overdosed since the drug‚Äôs introduction in the mid-1950s, of which three have died. K Marquardt, K, Albertson, T, Treatment of hydroxychloroquine overdose, Am J Emerg Med, Sep 2001; 19(5):420-4, doi: 10.1053/ajem.2001.25774, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11555803/ Chloroquine has a risk of death in overdose in adults of about 20%, while hydroxychloroquine is estimated to be two or threefold less toxic. Serious signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within an hour of ingestion. These may include sleepiness, vision changes, seizures, coma, stopping of breathing, and heart problems such as ventricular fibrillation and low blood pressure. Loss of vision may be permanent. Low blood potassium, to levels of 1 to 2 mmol/L, may also occur. Cardiovascular abnormalities such as QRS complex widening and QT interval prolongation may also occur. Treatment recommendations include early mechanical ventilation, heart monitoring, and activated charcoal. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required with epinephrine being the vasopressor of choice. Stomach pumping may also be used. Sodium bicarbonate and hypertonic saline may be used in cases of severe QRS complex widening. Seizures may be treated with benzodiazepines. Intravenous potassium chloride may be required, however this may result in high blood potassium later in the course of the disease. Dialysis does not appear to be useful. =Detection= Hydroxychloroquine may be quantified in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of sudden or unexpected death. Plasma or serum concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1-1.6 mg/L during therapy and 6‚Äì20 mg/L in cases of clinical intoxication, while blood levels of 20‚Äì100 mg/L have been observed in deaths due to acute overdosage.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 12th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2020, pp. 1024-1026.  Interactions  The drug transfers into breast milk. There is no evidence that its use during pregnancy is harmful to the developing fetus and its use is not contraindicated in pregnancy. The concurrent use of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin appears to increase the risk for certain serious side effects with short-term use, such as an increased risk of chest pain, congestive heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (Tagamet) or digoxin (Lanoxin). Hydroxychloroquinecan increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which may contribute to the development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of hydroxychloroquine. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine. While there may be a link between hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, this risk may be low in those of African descent. Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug label for hydroxychloroquine lists the following drug interactions: * Digoxin (wherein it may result in increased serum digoxin levels) * Insulin or anti-diabetic medication (wherein it may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment) * Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs (as Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing serious abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular arrhythmias) if used concurrently) * Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the seizure threshold (co-administration with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold may increase risk of convulsions) * Antiepileptics (concurrent use may impair the antiepileptic activity) * Methotrexate (combined use is unstudied and may increase the frequency of side effects) * Cyclosporin (wherein an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when used together). Pharmacology=Pharmacokinetics= Hydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, large distribution volume, and elimination by the kidneys. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5) metabolize hydroxychloroquine to N-desethylhydroxychloroquine. Both agents also inhibit CYP2D6 activity and may interact with other medications that depend on this enzyme. =Pharmacodynamics= Antimalarials are lipophilic weak bases and easily pass plasma membranes. The free base form accumulates in lysosomes (acidic cytoplasmic vesicles) and is then protonated, resulting in concentrations within lysosomes up to 1000 times higher than in culture media. This increases the pH of the lysosome from four to six. Alteration in pH causes inhibition of lysosomal acidic proteases causing a diminished proteolysis effect. Higher pH within lysosomes causes decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many immunologic and nonimmunologic consequences. These effects are believed to be the cause of a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide production by neutrophils. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak diprotic base that can pass through the lipid cell membrane and preferentially concentrate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. The higher pH of these vesicles in macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells limits the association of autoantigenic (any) peptides with class II MHC molecules in the compartment for peptide loading and/or the subsequent processing and transport of the peptide-MHC complex to the cell membrane. =Mechanism of action= Hydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells. In inflammatory conditions, it blocks toll-like receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9), which recognizes DNA- containing immune complexes, leads to the production of interferon and causes the dendritic cells to mature and present antigen to T cells. Hydroxychloroquine, by decreasing TLR signaling, reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process. In 2003, a novel mechanism was described wherein hydroxychloroquine inhibits stimulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the antimalarial mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved. The most accepted model is based on hydrochloroquinine and involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing death. Hydroxychloroquine increases the risk of low blood sugar through several mechanisms. These include decreased clearance of the hormone insulin from the blood, increased insulin sensitivity, and increased release of insulin from the pancreas. Hydroxychloroquine has been suggested to be a zinc ionophore, and may derive an anti-cancer action from increasing intracellular zinc uptake. Hydroxychloroquine can decrease tumor growth by cutting off the fuels that promote mitochondrial function. There are multiple phase I and II trials testing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Society and culture=Cost= The wholesale cost in the developing world was about per month , when used for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. In the United States the wholesale cost of a month of treatment is about . In the United Kingdom this dose costs the National Health Service about ¬£5.15. =Brand names= It is frequently sold as a sulfate salt known as hydroxychloroquine sulfate. 200 mg of the sulfate salt is equal to 155 mg of the base. Brand names of hydroxychloroquine include Plaquenil, Hydroquin, Axemal (in India), Dolquine, Quensyl, Quinoric. =Misinformation versus science= Beginning in March 2020, US President Donald Trump began promoting hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, citing small numbers of anecdotal reports. Trump stated in June that he was taking the drug as a preventive measure, stimulating unprecedented worldwide demand and causing shortages of hydroxychloroquine for its prescribed purpose of preventing malaria. After issuing an emergency use authorization for physicians to use the drug to treat hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 infection, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew the authorization in June after finding hydroxychloroquine was unlikely to be effective and had serious side effects. During ensuing months, additional studies found the drug was not effective, and in late July, Anthony Fauci stated, \\"We know that every single good study ‚Äî and by good study I mean randomized controlled study in which the data are firm and believable ‚Äî has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of COVID-19.\\"  Research = COVID-19 = There is no strong scientific evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for preventing or treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äë19). While its use is not approved by the FDA for COVID‚Äë19 treatment, from April to June 2020, there was an emergency use authorization for its use in the United States, and it has been used off label for potential treatment of the disease. On 24 April 2020, citing the risk of \\"serious heart rhythm problems\\", the FDA posted a caution against using the drug for COVID‚Äë19 \\"outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial\\". On 15 June, the FDA revoked its emergency use authorization, stating that it was \\"no longer reasonable to believe\\" that the drug was effective against COVID-19 or that its benefits outweighed \\"known and potential risks\\". On 29 May 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a list of references of observational studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID‚Äë19. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hydroxychloroquine in 821 participants found that it did not treat COVID‚Äë19 infection, although the study had limitations. In June, use of hydroxychloroquine in the UK RECOVERY Trial was discontinued when an interim analysis of 1,542 treatments showed it provided no mortality benefit over 28 days to people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection. Timeline U.S. President Donald Trump says he has been taking hydroxychloroquine. On 17 March 2020, Didier Raoult announced in an online video that a trial involving 24 patients from southeast France supported the claim that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective in treating for COVID-19. On 20 March, he published a preliminary report of his study online in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. A later peer review found the study was ‚Äúirresponsible.‚Äù On 17 March 2020, the AIFA Scientific Technical Commission of the Italian Medicines Agency expressed a favorable opinion on including the off-label use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID‚Äë19. During a press briefing on 19 March 2020, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, promoted the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID‚Äë19. Trump claimed that chloroquine had been \\"approved very, very quickly\\" by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) while discussing treatments for COVID‚Äë19. The FDA later said it had not given approval for the drug to be used in treatment of COVID‚Äë19, but was now allowing chloroquine under compassionate use guidelines. Trump's remarks led to a shortage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia. In the United States in March 2020, several state pharmacy boards reported that some doctors and dentists were writing prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, to themselves, family members, and staff. Sudden demand spikes caused by hospital use for severely ill COVID‚Äë19 patients and prescriptions for prophylaxis have resulted in shortages; doctors have expressed concern that patients who have long taken hydroxychloroquine for other approved indications, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, will be unable to procure needed medicine. News outlets reported on 24 March 2020 that, in the state of Arizona, a man had died, leaving his wife in critical condition, as a result of ingesting a product containing chloroquine phosphate designed for treating sick fish. The couple believed the fish treatment could prevent them from contracting COVID‚Äë19. Although chloroquine phosphate is a related compound to hydroxychloroquine, unlike hydroxychloroquine it is used for the treatment of fish parasites and infections. It has a different chemical structure from chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which, when used in humans and other animals, could result in death. In early April 2020, a Texas nursing home administered hydroxychloroquine to dozens of residents who had COVID-19. The facility's medical director, Dr. Robin Armstrong, acquired the drug through his connections to the Republican Party; he made the request through Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and used for certain people who are hospitalized with COVID‚Äë19. In anticipation of product shortages, the FDA issued product-specific guidance for chloroquine phosphate and for hydroxychloroquine sulfate for generic drug manufacturers. On 24 April 2020, \\"due to risk of heart rhythm problems\\", the FDA cautioned the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID‚Äë19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial. On 29 April 2020, based on a preprint retrospective cohort study posted 10 April 2020, on medRxiv of more than 320,000 individuals that were not infected with COVID‚Äë19, but had been treated with a combination of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, an article published in The FASEB Journal cautioned against this combination to treat patients with COVID‚Äë19 outside the context of a clinical trial. This was due to safety concerns with this combination and lack of evidence showing benefit to combining these medications. However the article suggested the combination could be used to treat COVID‚Äë19 patients if new strong scientific evidence showed that combination as beneficial, there is no alternative treatment available, and the patients are counselled and closely monitored. On 18 May 2020, Trump publicly stated that he was taking hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc and an initial dose of azithromycin during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic. Based on the results of a 22 May 2020 study published in The Lancet (which was retracted on 4 June 2020) the World Health Organization suspended hydroxychloroquine from its global drug trials for COVID‚Äë19 treatments on 26 May 2020, due to safety concerns in that study. It had previously enrolled 3,500 patients from 17 countries in the Solidarity Trial, which was the official name of its study of hydroxychloroquine against COVID‚Äë19. Due to the increased risks described in a subsequently retracted study, France, Italy and Belgium banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‚Äë19 treatment. None of the results used as the basis of these bans involved outpatient treatment. The first results for outpatient clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin are expected in September 2020. On 29 May 2020, the EMA issued a public health statement reminding healthcare professionals to closely monitor people with COVID‚Äë19 who are receiving hydroxychloroquine. On 3 June 2020, the WHO announced it would resume its global trial of hydroxychloroquine, after its data safety monitoring committee found there was no increased risk of death for COVID‚Äë19 patients taking it. On 4 June 2020, an article about the treatment of COVID‚Äë19 patients using hydroxychloroquine with or without macrolides that had been published in The Lancet on 22 May 2020, was retracted by its authors. Before its retraction it had claimed that hospitalized COVID‚Äë19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) did not benefit from the treatment, but instead were at greater risk of death. However, since its publication questions were raised about the accuracy of the data used in the article, prompting a third party review which resulted in the retraction of the article from the journal. On 5 June 2020, Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and chief investigator for a randomised trial on hydroxychloroquine, said: \\"the RECOVERY Trial has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\\". On 15 June 2020, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. The FDA also updated the fact sheets for the emergency use authorization of remdesivir, to warn that using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.

Carpenter was born in historic Salado in southern Bell County, Texas. In 1936, her 24-room residence there was declared a state historic monument. In 1967, a plaque was unveiled to indicate that Carpenter had once lived there. At the age of seven, she moved with her family to Austin. Carpenter stood in the forefront of the Women's Movement when it began and never wavered from her platform. Her projects and causes ranged from supporting high tech to fighting cancer. Often called the \\"funniest woman in politics\\", she was in demand as a public speaker until her death. Early life Carpenter launched her journalism career at Austin High School in Austin as the editor of the school paper, The Austin Maroon. Another aspiring journalist, Leslie E. \\"Les\\" CarpenterThe A. N. Marquis Company: Who's Who in the South and Southwest, Chicago, Ill., 1952, p. 128. (ca. 1921‚Äì1974) of Austin, was business manager of the newspaper. The two became best friends, majored in journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, and worked together on the university newspaper, The Daily Texan. Liz Carpenter was a member of Texas Orange Jackets, the University's oldest women's honorary service organization. Les firmly supported Liz when she was elected vice president of the student body, the first woman to have held that position. Media and political career In 1942, Carpenter began covering the White House and Congress for the Austin American-Statesman. For the next eighteen years, she reported on presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy as a Washington reporter. Les and Liz Carpenter were married on June 17, 1944, after he was discharged from the United States Navy during World War II. They launched the Carpenter News Bureau in the National Press Building in Washington, D.C. For the next sixteen years Carpenter covered Congress and the White House for various newspapers in Texas. She missed work only briefly when their two children, Scott and Christy, were born. She was still a working reporter at the time of the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. She soon joined the staff of Lyndon B. Johnson in his campaign for Vice President in 1960 and traveled on his foreign missions as a press spokeswoman. After Kennedy's election, she became the first woman executive assistant to the vice-president. Carpenter was in Dallas on November 22, 1963, at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She drafted the fifty-eight words that Johnson used on his return to Washington: :This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help and God's. Following Johnson's succession to the presidency, Carpenter became the first professional newswoman to be press secretary to a first lady for Lady Bird Johnson (1963‚Äì1969), for whom she also served as staff director. Carpenter also contributed to the speeches of President Johnson, particularly in the field of humor by creating the White House Humor Group. After the Johnson Administration ended in 1969, she wrote Ruffles and Flourishes, her account of her White House experiences. She was a vice president of Hill and Knowlton in Washington after leaving the White House. In 1971, she was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and co-chair of ERAmerica, traveling the country to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. She was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the International Women's Year Commission, by President Jimmy Carter to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Public Affairs, and by President Bill Clinton to serve on the White House Conference on Aging. Carpenter was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1977 to 1983. Literary career Liz Carpenter (left) with Cactus Pryor (right) in 2003. In 1974, Les Carpenter died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-two, just a year after the death of Lyndon Johnson. In 1976, Carpenter returned to Austin: \\"Family roots, the love for Texas and the University of Texas and the LBJ Library brought me back home.\\" She purchased a house, which she named \\"Grass Roots\\", located in the West Lake Hills overlooking the Austin skyline and the Colorado River Her books include: Unplanned Parenthood, Random House 1994; Getting Better All the Time, Simon and Schuster 1986, as well as countless articles and forays on the lecture circuit. Start With a Laugh, gives humorous advice on speech writing, was published by Eakin Press and launched at the opening of the National Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future in Dallas. Her most recent book, Presidential Humor, Bright Sky Press 2006, is a compilation of quips and quotes from \\"George the First to George the Worst.\\" Awards and recognition Carpenter was named a Distinguished Alumna of the University of Texas in 1975, and in 1990 was named distinguished alumnae of the Department of Communications. She was named by Governor Mark White to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. She was given the ProBene Award of the College of Liberal Arts. The Liz Carpenter Lectureship was established in 1984 by a group of her friends, including Erma Bombeck and Mark Russell, who gave a performance at the Paramount Theater to raise funds for it. In the last several years, Mrs. Carpenter's lectureship in the College of Liberal Arts has brought President Bill Clinton, President Gerald Ford, Hillary Clinton, Jehan Sadat, Maya Angelou, Bill Moyers, Jane Goodall, and writers such as Betty Friedan, Nora Ephron, Shana Alexander, and Jean Auel and nationally known humorists such as Fannie Flagg and Carol Channing. The Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year. The Award was established in 1992 by an anonymous donor who is committed to the publication of scholarly research on the history of women and Texas. The award honors Liz Carpenter, a sixth- generation Texan, for her commitment to the pursuit of the history of women in Texas and for a lifetime of achievements that qualify her as a maker of that history. She was the recipient of Alpha Phi's Frances E. Willard Award in 1980. She died in Austin, Texas in March 2010.

Its early establishment was necessary to collect revenue for the fledgling government, and over the years duties, tariffs and taxes collected by Customs have remained a major source of revenue for the country, although customs has also been used to impose various control over the movement of people and the distribution of particular products, in particular alcohol and tobacco. In 1996, the New Zealand Customs Department was renamed the New Zealand Customs Service. In recent years Customs has modernised itself in order to keep pace with new technologies and the ever- increasing volumes of international passengers and trade, while balancing its law enforcement and compliance obligations. Staffing levels sit between 1300 - 1500 nationally, with its head office located in Wellington. Staff are based at various ports and locations around New Zealand and are a mixture of frontline uniformed staff such as those seen at the airports and sea ports, as well as plainclothes staff in varying other roles.  Responsibilities  x-ray inspection unit at Ports of Auckland. Customs is a law enforcement agency in its own right, and is responsible for intercepting contraband, and checks international travelers and their baggage, as well as cargo and mail, for banned or prohibited items. Contrary to popular belief, it is not responsible for biosecurity items such as food and other agricultural items declared at ports of entry - this is the responsibility for the Ministry for Primary Industries. Customs is also responsible for assessing and collecting Customs duties, excise taxes and Goods and Services Tax on imports and protecting New Zealand businesses against illegal trade. It is second only to the Inland Revenue Department for the amount of revenue it collects for the New Zealand Government. It exercises controls over restricted and prohibited imports and exports, including objectionable material (such as child sex abuse images), drugs, firearms and hazardous waste and also collects import and export data. Customs is responsible for documentation of all imports and exports (in 2006/7 this was 47 million imports and 33 million exports). Since 1999 all documentation to Customs has been electronic. Customs works closely with New Zealand's other border agencies, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Aviation Security Service (AvSec) and Immigration New Zealand. It also works very closely with the New Zealand Police and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand in joint operations involving the importation of drugs, and with the Department of Conservation on the management of items that are subject to CITES. Customs established the Trade Single Window in 2013 to provide a single place to lodge import and export documents with all of New Zealand Government. Whilst an unarmed agency, some Customs officers are authorised to carry handcuffs and make arrests in relation to offences relating to the importation of drugs and other prohibited goods. Customs is also the administrative body of the New Zealand Government responsible for the domestic collection and control of excise tax on tobacco and alcohol. = Pseudoephedrine = Customs officers continue to make significant seizures of pseudoephedrine, a precursor for Methamphetamine. Open source media and Customs reporting to government suggests that pseudoephedrine makes up the large majority of Customs seizures. These seizures have resulted in multiple arrests and successful prosecutions by Customs and Police officers. In October 2010, then Comptroller of Customs Martyn Dunne advised a New Zealand Parliament committee that 796 kg of Pseudoephedrine, with a value of $90 million, had been seized in the nine months to 30 September, compared with 733 kg for the whole year in 2009. It was later revealed that Customs seized over a tonne of pseudoephedrine in 2010.  Office locations  Customs officers are based at the main cities in New Zealand, as well as a number of smaller ports. Its headquarters is in Wellington, New Zealand's capital city. Customs also has liaison officers based at the following overseas locations: Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Canberra, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.  Recruitment and training = Recruitment = Customs conducts national intakes, with the number of intakes per year varying dependent on the needs of the Service. Typically each intake will consist of 20 - 30 recruits who are referred to as 'cohorts'. Recruiting usually begins with Customs advertising nationwide, calling for applications for persons who meet requisite criteria. Applications are then reviewed and accepted or rejected. The majority of applicants are culled at this initial stage. Persons who pass the initial application process are then invited to 'open days' at central locations (usually Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch) during which they are given insights into the various roles Customs undertakes as well as being placed into groups and are assessed during group problem solving scenarios, where individuals are observed by assessors and are judged on various factors such as interaction, initiative and leadership traits. Those who are deemed suitable must then pass an interview, police checks and medical test before being offered a space on the next intake. = Training = Training consists of a 6 week, classroom based course. This is gives new cohorts extensive knowledge in Customs, covering Customs history, relevant legislation, questioning techniques, physical training, self-defense training, and presentations from various other work areas In Customs. During the course, multiple examinations are undertaken, and if passed, new cohorts will be awarded their \\"stripes\\" in the form of epaulettes. Following the classroom course, there is on-the-job training for one year. At the conclusion of all training, cohorts will have a graduation ceremony where they will be awarded with a certificate confirming their graduation.

He came to prominence in the 1970s as a member of the band Bruford led by drummer Bill Bruford. Musical career Berlin was born in Queens, New York, on January 17, 1953. He studied violin for ten years until he was 14, when he was inspired to play bass after seeing the Beatles. He then attended Berklee College of Music to study bass. He first came to international attention in 1977 when he was handpicked by British musician Bill Bruford for his debut album Feels Good to Me. A bandmate here was guitarist Allan Holdsworth who employed Berlin for his 1983 Warner Brothers album: Road Games. On August 30, 2013, Berlin married Gabriela Sinagra, a jazz singer and vocal coach from Rosario, Argentina. Style and appreciation In a review for his album Low Standards, Bass Musician Magazine said, \\"Anytime I mention [Jeff Berlin], there seems to be a ripple in the force and the wave of Berlin supporters or antagonists come to the surface and spout-off their opinions. No matter where you stand regarding Jeff's musical philosophy, no one can reasonably deny the simple fact that Jeff seriously knows his craft and is one of the major players of our time.\\" Berlin's playing style has been compared to that of Jaco Pastorius; however, Berlin has repeatedly stated his distaste for Jaco imitators.

The bridge links the suburb of Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai (other three being the Airoli Bridge, Mulund check naka and Dahisar check naka), and handles traffic directed towards the region to the south and east of Mumbai. The bridge has earned a reputation as a suicide spot. The Public Works Department has plans to put up barriers to deter jumpers. History The first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was conceived by Adi Kanga and was built in 1973. The bridge is 1837m in length and has a substandard 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noted on the bottom side of the prestressed girders of some spans. This led to a series of extensive repairs including external prestressing. It was simultaneously decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one. Construction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened to traffic in 1992. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic. Construction A new bridge having a 6 lane divided carriageway and length of 1837.35 m (30 m down stream) was constructed from 1987 to 1997 with several unique features in the construction and design with emphasis on durability and a formal QA/QC programme. Proof Consultants were appointed to oversee each aspect of planning, design and construction. Open foundations were taken into the bedrock with foundation concrete being laid in the dry, with the sea water being pumped out using submersible pumps. The piers in the intertidal zone were protected by epoxy coal tar paint painted on 6 mm thick m.s. plate which was considered as a lost shuttering. The superstructure was a P.S.C. box girder, one for each carriageway, constructed using balanced cantilever cast-in-situ segments. The new bridge (also the Vashi Bridge) has performed without any problems whatsoever. This bridge was constructed by U.P State Bridge Corporation Ltd. for which it was awarded the most outstanding concrete structure award. View of Navi Mumbai skyline from the railway bridge. The new bridge is also known as the 2nd Thane Creek Bridge. The lane expansion work on Vashi Bridge was scheduled to begin in 2018, with the authorities identifying Larsen and Toubro as the lowest bidder for the contract. http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vashi- bridge-expansion-a-step-closer/article23953889.ece See also * List of longest bridges in the world * List of longest bridges above water in India *Vikhroli Koparkhairane Link Road * Airoli Bridge References Category:Truss bridges Category:Bridges in Maharashtra Category:Transport in Navi Mumbai Category:Buildings and structures in Navi Mumbai ","title":"Vashi Bridge"},{"id":"2298017","title":"John Hughes (footballer, born 1964)"},{"id":"2298021","text":"Menispermaceae (Botanical Latin: 'Moonseed Family' from Greek mene 'crescent moon' and sperma 'seed') is a family of flowering plants. The alkaloid tubocurarine, a neuromuscular blocker and the active ingredient in the 'tube curare' form of the dart poison curare, is derived from the South American liana Chondrodendron tomentosum. Several other South American genera belonging to the family have been used to prepare the 'pot' and calabash' forms of curare. The family contains 68 genera with some 440 species, which are distributed throughout low-lying tropical areas with some species present in temperate and arid regions.  Description  * Twining woody climbing plants, winding anti-clockwise (Stephania winds clockwise) or vines, rarely upright shrubs or small trees, more rarely still herbaceous plants or epiphytes (Stephania cyanantha), perennial or deciduous, with simple to uni-serrate hairs. * Alternate spiral leaves, simple, whole, dentate, lobed to palmatifid (bi- o trifoliate in Burasaia), frequently peltate, petiolated, petiole frequently pulvinate at both extremes, without stipules, sometimes with spines derived from the petioles (Antizoma), venation, parallelodromous, penninerved or frequently palmatinerved, bifacial, rarely isofacial, in Angelisia and Anamirta with hydathodes derived from trichomes, domatia present in 5 genera as pits or hair tufts. Various types of stomata, frequently cyclocytic. * Rapidly growing stems with trilacunar nodes. Phylloclades are present in Cocculus balfourii. * Dioecious plants, sometimes perfect flowers in Tiliacora acuminata and Parabaena denudata. * Inflorescences in racemiform, paniculate or thyrse with partial inflorescences in a capituliform cyme or pseudo-umbel, multifloral, rarely single or paired flowers, axillary or on sharp branches or cauliflorous trunks, females frequently less branched. * Flowers small, regular to zygomorphic (Antizoma, Cyclea, Cissampelos), cyclic to irregularly spiral, hypogynous, basically trimers. Receptacle sometimes with developed gynophore. Sepals (1-)3-12 or more, usually in (1-)2(-many) whorls of 3, rarely 6, free to slightly fused, imbricate or valvate, sometimes less numerous in female flowers. Petals 0-6, in 2 whorls of 3, rarely of 6, free or fused, frequently holding the opposite stamen, sometimes less numerous in female flowers. Androecium of (1-)3-6(-40) stamens free of the perianth, free or fused together in 2-5, fasciculate or monadelphous, introrse, dehiscence along longitudinal, oblique or transversal slits. Female flowers sometimes with staminodes. Gynoecium apocarpous, superior, of (1-)3-6(-32) carpels, usually oppositipetalous, stigma apical, dry, papilous, ovules 2 per carpel, anatropous, hemianatropous to campilotropous, uni- or bitegmic, crassinucellate, the superior epitropous and fertile, the inferior apotropous and abortive, placentation marginal ventral. Male flowers sometimes with carpelodes. * Fruit compound, each unit in a straight or flattened, asymmetric drupe, more or less stipitate (rarely only one developed), not coalescing, exocarp sub-coriaceous or membranous, mesocarp pulpy, fleshy or fibrous, endocarp woody to petrous, rough, tuberous, echinate or ribbed, often with a recess in the placenta called a condyle. * Seeds slightly curved or spiral (Limaciopsis, Spirospermum), with endosperm absent or present, totally or only ventrally ruminate or not ruminate, oleaginous, embryo straight or curved, with two cotyledons flat or cylindrical, leafy or fleshy, divaricate or applied. * Pollen tricolpate, without operculum nor ribs, tectum perreticulate columellate, endexine granular; or the pollen can be colporate (Abuta), syncolporate (Tinospora), pororate or hexa-cryptoporate (with 6 apertures). * Chromosomal number: x = 11, 13, 19, 25. 2n can be up to 52.  Ecology  It is thought that the cauliflorous species are pollinated by small bees, beetles or flies although there are no direct observations of this. Birds disperse the purple or black drupes, for example Sayornis phoebe (a Tyrant flycatcher) eats the fruit of Cocculus. In Tinospora cordifolia a lapse of 6‚Äì8 weeks has been observed between fertilization and the first zygotic cell division. The menispermaceae predominantly inhabit low altitude tropical forests (up to 2,100m), where they are climbers, but some genera and species have adapted to arid locations (Antizoma species have adapted to the South African deserts or Cocculus balfouri and its phylloclades have adapted to the climate on the island of Socotra) and other temperate climates. C3 photosynthesis has been recorded in Menispermum.  Phytochemistry  The family contains a wide range of benzylisoquinoline compounds (alkaloids) and lignans such as furofuran, flavones and flavonols and some proanthocyanidins. The most notable are the wide variety of alkaloids derived from benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline and aporphine, which accumulate as dimers, as well as the alkaloids derived from morphinan and from hasubanan and other diverse types of alkaloid such as derivative of aza-fluoranthene. Sesquiterpenes such as picrotoxin and diterpenes such as clerodane diterpene are also present, while the triterpenes are scarce and where present are similar to oleanane. Ecdysone steroids have also been found. Some species are cyanogenic.  Uses  The Menispermaceae have been used in traditional pharmacopeia and drugs have been formulated from these plants that are of great use in modern medicine. These drugs are based on alkaloids and include tubocurarine from curare, a poison used by indigenous South American tribes on their poison darts, that is obtained from species of Curarea, Chondrodendron, Sciadotenia and Telitoxicum. A similar poison was used in Asia (ipos) that was obtained from species of Anamirta, Tinospora, Coscinium and Cocculus. Tubocurarine and its synthetic derivatives are used to relax muscles during surgical interventions. The roots of \\"kalumba\\" or \\"colombo\\" (Jateorhiza palmata) are used in Africa for stomach problems and against dysentery. Species of Tinospora are used in Asia as antipyretics, the fruit of Anamirta cocculus is used to poison fish and birds and the stems of Fibraurea are used to dye fabric yellow. The South East Asian species Coscinium fenestratum, a local Thai remedy for stomach ailments ( which contains berberine and related alkaloids ) was recently implicated in mass harvesting operations to prepare extracts usable as precursors in the manufacture of the drug MDMA.

Systematic position  The APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998) recognizes this family and places in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. Their trimerous flower structure is similar to the Lardizabalaceae and Berberidaceae, although they differ from them in other important characteristics. The APW (Angiosperm Phylogeny Website) considers that they form part of the Order Ranunculales, and that they are a sister group on the branch formed by the Lardizabalaceae and Berberidaceae families in a reasonably advanced clade of the order (cf. AP-website). Kinship with the Berberidaceae is further borne out by similarities in phytochemistry e.g. in the presence of berberine and related alkaloids. It is a medium-sized family of 70 genera totaling 420 extant species,APG website mostly of climbing plants. The great majority of the genera are tropical, but with a few (notably Menispermum and Cocculus) reaching temperate climates in eastern North America and eastern Asia.  Taxa included  The genetic factors within this family are very narrow, as there are many genera with one or a few species. There is not currently enough data from genetic studies to evaluate either this situation or the traditional division into five tribes (see Kessler, 1993, in the References section). This division is fundamentally based on characteristics of the seed (endosperm and cotyledons) but there is doubt as to whether the tribes are monophyletic.

Ice cream is typically sold as regular ice cream (also called hard-packed ice cream), and/or soft serve, which is usually dispensed by a machine with a limited number of flavors (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, and \\"twist\\", or \\"zebra\\", a mix of the two). Ice cream parlors generally offer a number of flavors and items. Parlors often serve ice cream and other frozen desserts in cones, cups or dishes, the latter two to be eaten with a spoon. Some ice cream parlors prepare ice cream desserts such as sundaes (ice cream topped with syrup, whipped cream and other toppings) or milkshakes, or even a blend (known as a Boston shake). History Gelato selections at a Sicilian gelateria While the origins of ice cream are often debated, most scholars trace the first ice cream parlor back to France in the 17th century. In 1686, Francesco Procopio del Coltelli opened Paris' first caf√©. The Caf√© Procope, named by its Sicilian founder, introduced gelato to the French public. The dessert was served to its elite guests in small porcelain bowls. Until 1800, ice cream remained a rare and exotic dessert enjoyed mostly by the elite. The introduction of insulated ice houses in 1800, the first ice cream factory in Pennsylvania in 1851, and industrial refrigeration in the 1870s made manufacturing and storing ice cream much simpler. The first ice cream factory was built by Jacob Fussell, a milk dealer who bought dairy products from Philadelphia farmers and sold them in Baltimore. The mass production of ice cream cut the product's cost significantly, making it more popular and more affordable for people of lower classes. In the early 1800s, an early form of a U.S. ice cream parlor was existent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that sold \\"all kinds of refreshments, as Ice Cream, Syrups, French Cordials, Cakes, Clarets of the best kind, Jellies, etc.\\" According to one source, the first U.S. ice cream parlor opened in New York City in 1790. Product overview Gelato is a type of Italian ice cream with more milk and less cream than American ice cream. Sorbet is a frozen treat made from fruit, syrup and ice. No milk or cream is used. Frozen yogurt is a common low-fat ice cream alternative with a smooth texture that is similar to soft serve ice cream. All of these frozen products may be sold in ice cream cones, cups, sundaes, and milkshakes. Some parlors may also sell ice cream cakes, ice cream bars and other pre-packaged frozen sweets. In addition to frozen dessert products, some modern ice cream parlors also sell a variety of hot fast foods. File:Italian-parlour.jpgAn Italian ice cream parlor with varieties of gelato (ice cream) File:English-parlour.jpgAn English ice cream parlor with varieties of traditional ice cream Types Entry to an ice cream parlor in the United States Parlors vary in terms of size and environment. Some only have an order window and outside seating, while others have complete indoor facilities. Some parlors have drive-through windows. There are even parlors that combine several of these methods. Some parlors remain open all year round, typically in warmer weather locations and urban areas, and others in colder climates stay open only during warmer months, particularly from March to November. For example, some ice cream parlors in Vienna, Austria close in the winter months. Some ice cream parlors in Moscow, Russia, offer alcoholic beverages along with ice cream. Ice cream parlor chains Because ice cream parlors are located throughout the world, there are both small, local franchises as well as large, global enterprises. Some of the most notable large, global ice cream parlors include Baskin-Robbins, Ben & Jerry's, Bruster's Ice Cream, Carvel, Cold Stone Creamery, Dairy Queen, Dippin' Dots, Friendly's, and H√§agen-Dazs. Yogurtland, Yogen Fr√ºz, and sweetFrog are notable frozen yogurt parlors. Just as the size, style, and selection within each ice cream parlor may differ, so may its notoriety. Each July in the United States, in honor of National Ice Cream Month, several prominent publications rank the popularity of ice cream parlors throughout the United States. In 2014, Travel + Leisure, National Geographic, Business Insider, Food & Wine, and TripAdvisor published their top ranked ice cream parlors. * Travel + Leisure: America's Best Ice Cream Shops * National Geographic: Top 10 Places to Eat Ice Cream * Business Insider: The 10 Best Ice Cream Shops In The US, According To Pinterest Users * Food & Wine: Best Ice Cream Spots in the U.S. * TripAdvisor: Best ice cream parlors in the US, ranked by TripAdvisor users See also * List of ice cream brands * List of ice cream flavors * List of frozen yogurt companies ReferencesExternal links * Category:Restaurants by type ","title":"Ice cream parlor"},{"id":"2298023","text":"The sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, codenamed Op√©ration Satanique, was a bombing operation by the \\"action\\" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure (DGSE), carried out on 10 July 1985. During the operation, two operatives sank the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet, the Rainbow Warrior, at the Port of Auckland in New Zealand on its way to a protest against a planned French nuclear test in Moruroa. Fernando Pereira, a photographer, drowned on the sinking ship. France initially denied responsibility, but two French agents were captured by New Zealand Police and charged with arson, conspiracy to commit arson, willful damage, and murder. The scandal resulted in the resignation of the French Defence Minister Charles Hernu, while the two agents pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to ten years in prison. They spent a little over two years confined to the French island of Hao before being freed by the French government. Several political figures, including then New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, have referred to the bombing as an act of terrorism or state-sponsored terrorism. Background France began testing nuclear weapons in 1966 on Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. In 1985 eight South Pacific countries, including New Zealand and Australia, signed a treaty declaring the region a nuclear-free zone. Since being acquired by Greenpeace in 1977, Rainbow Warrior was active in supporting a number of anti-whaling, anti-seal hunting, anti-nuclear testing and anti-nuclear waste dumping campaigns during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since early 1985, the ship was based in the southern Pacific Ocean, where its crew campaigned against nuclear testing. After relocating 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll, which had been polluted by radioactivity by past American nuclear tests, it travelled to New Zealand to lead a flotilla of yachts protesting against French nuclear testing at the Mururoa Atoll.The evacuation of Rongelap (from the Greenpeace website. Accessed 12 July 2010.) During previous nuclear tests at Mururoa, protest ships had been boarded by French commandos after sailing into the shipping exclusion zone around the atoll. For the 1985 tests, Greenpeace intended to monitor the impact of nuclear tests and place protesters on the island to monitor the blasts. French agents posing as interested supporters or tourists toured the ship while it was open to public viewing. DGSE agent Christine Cabon, who had previously worked on intelligence missions in the Middle East, posed as environmentalist \\"Frederique Bonlieu\\" in order to infiltrate the Greenpeace office in Auckland.The French Government and Greenpeace Agents back in court on Friday The Canberra Times, 20 November 1985, at Trove While working for the Auckland office, Cabon secretly monitored communications from the Rainbow Warrior, collected maps, and investigated underwater equipment. Sinking of the ship Fernando Pereira, a photographer who was trapped and drowned in the sinking ship Three agents on board the yacht Ouv√©a imported the limpet mines used for the bombing. Two more agents, Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart, posing as the newlywed couple \\"Sophie and Alain Turenge\\", picked up the mines and delivered them to the bombing team, consisting of the divers Jean Camas (\\"Jacques Camurier\\") and Jean-Luc Kister (\\"Alain Tonel\\"). After sufficient information had been gathered, Camas and Kister attached two limpet mines to the Rainbow Warrior berthed at Marsden Wharf. They were detonated 10 minutes apart. The first bomb went off at 23:38, blasting a hole about the size of an average car. The agents may have intended the first mine to cripple the ship so that it would be evacuated safely by the time the second mine was detonated. However, the crew did not react to the first explosion as the agents had expected. While the ship was initially evacuated, some of the crew returned to the ship to investigate and film the damage. A Portuguese-Dutch photographer, Fernando Pereira, returned below decks to fetch his camera equipment. At 23:45, the second bomb went off. Pereira drowned in the rapid flooding that followed, and the other ten crew members either safely abandoned ship on the order of Captain Peter Willcox or were thrown into the water by the second explosion. The Rainbow Warrior sank four minutes later.  France implicated  Rainbow Warrior, 1981 Operation Satanic was a public relations disaster. France, being an ally of New Zealand, initially denied involvement and joined in condemning what it described as a terrorist act. The French embassy in Wellington denied involvement, stating that \\"the French Government does not deal with its opponents in such ways\\".Diary compiled by Mike Andrews (Secretary of the Dargaville Maritime Museum) After the bombing, the New Zealand Police started one of the country's largest police investigations. They identified two of the French agents, Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart, as possible suspects. Prieur and Mafart were identified with the help of a Neighbourhood Watch group, and arrested. Both were questioned and investigated. Because they were carrying Swiss passports, their true identities were discovered, along with the French government's responsibility. The other agents of the French team all escaped from New Zealand. Christine Cabon, whose role had ended before the bombing, had left for Israel immediately prior to the sinking. After she was identified as a participant in the operation, Auckland police requested that the Israeli authorities detain her. Cabon was tipped off and fled before she could be arrested. Three other agents, Chief Petty Officer Roland Verge (\\"Raymond Velche\\"), Petty Officer Jean-Michel Bartelo (\\"Jean-Michel Berthelo\\") and Petty Officer G√©rard Andries (\\"Eric Audrenc\\"), who had carried the bombs to New Zealand on the yacht Ouv√©a, escaped by that yacht, and were arrested by Australian police on Norfolk Island, but released as Australian law did not allow them to be held until the results of forensic tests came back. They were then picked up by the French submarine Rubis, which scuttled the Ouv√©a. Rainbow Warrior, 1985 in Auckland Several agents, including Jean-Luc Kister, one of the bombers, had posed as tourists. They took a ferry to the South Island, went skiing at Mt Hutt, and then left the country using false documents about 10 days later. Another agent, Louis-Pierre Dillais, possibly the commander of the operation, was also never captured. Once it was realised that the bombing was the action of the government of a friendly state, the New Zealand government stopped referring to it as a \\"terrorist act\\", instead calling it \\"a criminal attack in breach of the international law of state responsibility, committed on New Zealand sovereign territory\\". The \\"breach of international law\\" aspect was referred to in all communications with the United Nations in order to dissuade any arguments from the French government that might imply justification for their act. Prieur and Mafart pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. France threatened an economic embargo of New Zealand's exports to the European Economic Community if the pair were not released. Such an action would have crippled the New Zealand economy, which was dependent on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom. France launched their own commission of enquiry headed by which declared the French government innocent of any involvement in the terrorist act, claiming that the arrested agents, who had not yet pleaded guilty, had merely been spying on Greenpeace. When The Times and Le Monde contradicted these findings by claiming that President Mitterrand had approved the bombing, Defence Minister Charles Hernu resigned and the head of the DGSE, Admiral Pierre Lacoste, was fired. Eventually Prime Minister Laurent Fabius admitted the bombing had been a French plot: on 22 September 1985, he summoned journalists to his office to read a 200-word statement in which he said: \\"The truth is cruel,\\" and acknowledged there had been a cover-up; he went on to say that \\"Agents of the French secret service sank this boat. They were acting on orders.\\"Evening Mail ‚Äì Monday 23 September 1985 Aftermath=Nuclear testing= Memorial to the Rainbow Warrior, at Matauri Bay in Northland, New Zealand In the wake of the bombing, a flotilla of private New Zealand yachts sailed to Moruroa to protest against a French nuclear test. At that time, French nuclear tests in the Pacific were halted. However, another series of tests was conducted in 1995. =Greenpeace and the Rainbow Warrior= A Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior benefit concert at Mt. Smart Stadium, Auckland, on 5 April 1986 included performances by Herbs, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Topp Twins, Dave Dobbyn and a Split Enz reunion. The Rainbow Warrior was refloated for forensic examination. She was deemed irreparable and scuttled in Matauri Bay, near the Cavalli Islands on 12 December 1987, to serve as a dive wreck and fish sanctuary. Her masts had been removed and put on display at the Dargaville Maritime Museum. On 14 October 2011, Greenpeace launched a new sailing vessel called Rainbow Warrior III, which is equipped with an auxiliary electric motor.Rainbow Warrior Greenpeace International, October 2011. Accessed 10 February 2015 =Reparations= Rainbow Warrior Memorial from Above In 1987, after international pressure, France paid $8.16m to Greenpeace in damages, which helped finance another ship. It also paid compensation to the Pereira family, reimbursing his life insurance company for 30,000 guilders and making reparation payments of 650,000 francs to Pereira's wife, 1.5 million francs to his two children, and 75,000 francs to each of his parents. =Foreign relations= The failure of Western leaders to condemn this violation of a friendly nation's sovereignty caused a great deal of change in New Zealand's foreign and defence policy.Keith Sinclair, A History of New Zealand Penguin Books, New Zealand, 1991 New Zealand distanced itself from the United States, a traditional ally, and built relationships with small South Pacific nations, while retaining excellent relations with Australia and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom.Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way, The Right Honourable David Lange, Penguin Books, New Zealand, 1990 Hao atoll In June 1986, in a political deal with Prime Minister of New Zealand David Lange, presided over by United Nations Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, France agreed to pay NZ$13 million (US$6.5 million) to New Zealand and apologise, in return for which Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur would be detained at the French military base on Hao Atoll for three years. However, the two agents had both returned to France by May 1988, after less than two years on the atoll. Mafart returned to Paris on 14 December 1987 for medical treatment, and was apparently freed after the treatment. He continued in the French Army and was promoted to colonel in 1993. Prieur returned to France on 6 May 1988 because she was pregnant, her husband having been allowed to join her on the atoll. She, too, was freed and later promoted. The removal of the agents from Hao without subsequent return was ruled to be in violation of the 1986 agreement. Following the breach of the arrangement, in 1990 the secretary-general awarded New Zealand another NZ$3.5 million (US$2 million), to establish the New Zealand / France Friendship Fund. Although France had formally apologised to the New Zealand Government in 1986, during a visit in April 1991 French Prime Minister Michel Rocard delivered a personal apology. He said it was \\"to turn the page in the relationship and to say, if we had known each other better, this thing never would have happened\\". The Friendship Fund has provided contributions to a number of charity and public purposes. During a visit in 2016, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls reiterated that the incident had been \\"a serious error\\". =Further investigations= In 2005, French newspaper Le Monde released a report from 1986 which said that Admiral Pierre Lacoste, head of DGSE at the time, had \\"personally obtained approval to sink the ship from the late president Fran√ßois Mitterrand.\\" Soon after the publication, former Admiral Lacoste came forward and gave newspaper interviews about the situation, admitting that the death weighed on his conscience and saying that the aim of the operation had not been to kill. He acknowledged the existence of three teams: the yacht crew, reconnaissance and logistics (those successfully prosecuted), plus a two-man team that carried out the bombing. On the twentieth anniversary of the sinking, it was revealed that Mitterrand had personally authorised the mission. A 20th anniversary memorial edition of the 1986 book Eyes of Fire: The Last Voyage of the Rainbow Warrior by New Zealand author David Robie ‚Äì who was aboard the bombed ship ‚Äì was published in July 2005. =The French agents= Twenty years after the bombing, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) sought access to a video record made at the preliminary hearing in which the two French agents pleaded guilty. The footage had remained sealed since shortly after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The two agents opposed release of the footage‚Äîdespite having both written books on the incident‚Äîand unsuccessfully took the case to the New Zealand Court of Appeal and, subsequently, the Supreme Court of New Zealand. On 7 August 2006, judges Hammond, O'Regan and Arnold dismissed the former French agents' appeal and TVNZ broadcast their guilty pleas the same day. In 2005, in an interview with New Zealand state broadcaster TVNZ, Louis-Pierre Dillais acknowledged his involvement with the bombing.Goldenberg, Suzanne (25 May 2007) \\"Rainbow Warrior ringleader heads firm selling arms to US government\\". guardian.co.uk, Retrieved 26 May 2007 In 2007 the New Zealand Green Party criticized the government over its purchase of arms from Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal, whose U.S. subsidiary was led by Dillais.NZ trades with Arms Company whose US chief executive was a lead agent in the Rainbow Warrior bombing NZ Green Party Just Peace newsletter No 110, 18 May 2007.

In September 2015, TVNZ's Sunday programme tracked down Jean- Luc Kister, one of the two bombers. Kister, who retired from the DGSE in about 2000, admitted his lead role and feelings of responsibility for the lethal attack. He also pointed to the French President, as commander of the armed forces and intelligence services assigned the operation. Reporter John Hudson, who spent two days with Kister in France, said that Kister \\"wanted an opportunity to talk about his role in the bombing... It has been on his conscience for 30 years. He said to us, 'secret agents don't talk', but he is talking. I think he wanted to be understood.\\" Kister considered the mission \\"a big, big failure\\".

Behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut-shaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by sexual violence, or some combination of these. It has been used to describe and explain behavior within social groups, including prison rape and in conflict areas where war rape is used as psychological warfare. Entire societies have been alleged to be rape cultures. It is associated with rape fantasy and rape pornography. The notion of rape culture was developed by second-wave feminists, primarily in the United States, beginning in the 1970s. Critics of the concept dispute its existence or extent, arguing that the concept is too narrow or that, although there are cultures where rape is pervasive, the idea of rape culture can imply that the rapist is not at fault but rather the society that enables rape. Many movements have addressed rape culture, such as SlutWalk and Me Too. These movements have helped share people's stories through hashtags that are embodied and connected to rape. Origins and usage The term \\"rape culture\\" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by second-wave feminists and applied to contemporary American culture as a whole. During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in consciousness-raising efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor Alexandra Rutherford, most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating were rare.Review of Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape quoted in The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was an extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was redefined as a violent crime rather than a sex crime and its motive redefined from desire for sexual pleasure to male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms.Brownmiller, Susan. Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape. Ballantine, 1975. Print Maschke, Karen J. The Legal Response to Violence against Women. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. Rape also started to be reexamined through the eyes of the victims rather than the perpetrators. The first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women, edited by Noreen Connell and Cassandra Wilson for the New York Radical Feminists. In the book, the group wrote, \\"our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society\\". This book and Susan Brownmiller's 1975 Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape were among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape. Their authors intended to demonstrate that rape was much more common than previously believed. In the book, Brownmiller comments that women never talk about rape because they do not want to be open about a \\"crime against their physical integrity\\", which explains public ignorance of rape's prevalence. Brownmiller, a member of the New York Radical Feminists, argued that both academia and the public ignore incidents of rape. She helped psychologists begin observing and studying what sparked this \\"rape supportive culture\\". Against Our Will is considered a landmark work on feminism and sexual violence and one of the pillars of modern rape studies. Sociology professor Joyce E. Williams traces the origin and first usage of the term \\"rape culture\\" to the 1975 documentary film Rape Culture, produced and directed by Margaret Lazarus and Renner Wunderlich for Cambridge Documentary Films. She said the film \\"takes credit for first defining the concept\\". The film discusses rape of both men and women in the context of a larger cultural normalization of rape. The film featured the work of the DC Rape Crisis Center in co-operation with Prisoners Against Rape, Inc. It includes interviews with rapists and victims, as well as with prominent anti-rape activists such as feminist philosopher and theologian Mary Daly and author and artist Emily Culpepper. The film explored how mass media and popular culture have perpetuated attitudes towards rape. In their 1992 Journal of Social Issues paper \\"A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change\\", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggest that the term originated as \\"rape-supportive culture\\" in Against Our Will.Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, \\"A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change\\", Journal of Social Issues, vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J. Maschke, \\"The legal response to violence against women\\", Routledge 1997, . By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to be used more widely in multiple forms of media. Overview Feminists and gender activists conceptualize rape culture as a cultural environment that encourages gender violence, as well as perpetuating \\"rape myths\\", ranging from treating rape as merely \\"rough sex\\" to blaming the victim for inviting rape. Michael Parenti believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as victim blaming, reluctance by authorities to go against patriarchial cultural norms, as well as fears of stigmatization suffered by rape victims and their families. Other sociologists posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape. One explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain \\"bad\\" or \\"misbehaved\\" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an \\"otherness\\" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped. One common rape myth is that no event is random. This promotes the idea that the women who are raped were not raped for no reason, but that they deserved it. If women believe that they were the cause of the rape, they may not go to authorities. Society also uses the stereotype of men being aggressive as an excuse for their actions. This justifies and normalizes rape. Society creates these myths, scaring women before they are even raped. Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the \\"just-world\\" hypothesis which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to their actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserve it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women. Brownmiller, in Against Our Will, discusses three ideas that helped bring awareness to some clearly defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just \\"evil\\" or \\"mentally ill\\" men as thought in previous decades. Finally, rape can occur in many different forms besides the stereotype of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger. The idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always \\"young, careless [and] beautiful\\" or they are \\"loose\\" women who \\"invite rape\\" by provoking men.\\"Gordon, Margaret T., and Stephanie Riger. The Female Fear: The Social Cost of Rape. Urbana: U of Illinois, 1991. . Although Brownmiller's idea about victim blaming was supposed to expose rape myths thus eradicating victim- blaming, blaming the victim in rape circumstances is still a common practice. Rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. In the 1960s, rapists were often seen as mentally ill or deviants in society, and this view persisted among some people into the 1990s. Rape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined as \\"acquaintance rape\\", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss. Chris O'Sullivan asserts that acts of sexism are commonly employed to validate and rationalize normative misogynistic practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted. O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at \\"frat life\\" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow \\"brothers\\", as they engage in contests over sex with women.Chris O'Sullivan, Transforming a Rape Culture, edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher & Martha Roth, , page 26 In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as part of a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.Chris O'Sullivan, \\"Fraternities and the Rape Culture\\", in Transforming a Rape Culture, edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher & Martha Roth, To some, the root cause of rape culture is the \\"domination and objectification of women\\". However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture. Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change. Reasoning about rape and rape culture is also influenced by gender and heterosexuality norms.Herman, Dianne F. \\"The Rape Culture\\". Printed in Women: A Feminist Perspective (ed. Jo Freeman). McGraw Hill, 1994. Retrieved 18 October 2011. For example, in South Africa the overriding \\"war culture\\", which emphasized masculinity and violence, led to a culture in which rape was normalized. A University of California Davis public document alleged that major causes of rape were the enforcement of women having to follow social rules and the conditioning of gender roles. Others say in a rape culture women are conditioned to assume responsibility for male sexuality, and gender roles are socially constructed and enforced on women through fear. Since the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of universities' and colleges' ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society. Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as \\"rape\\" and who is treated as a \\"genuine victim\\" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight. Their emotional responses are observed and reported during investigations to aid in deciding if the victim is lying or not. In addition, college administration officials have sometimes questioned accounts of victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventive legislation as the Clery Act, which requires colleges to report on crimes. Rape culture is closely related to slut-shaming and victim blaming, in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household. That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture. 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police. Victim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim \\"deserved it\\" because she was defined as a slut. Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did \\"want to have sex\\". Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of pornography, which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity. Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs. Prison rape is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of Just Detention International, states \\"Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay.\\" = Sexualization = Sexualization and sexual objectification are practices that contribute to the normalization of hyper-sexualized perceptions of women, which is a theme in rape culture. Hyper-sexualized or pornographic media is often attributed with perpetuating aggressive behaviors and attitudes supporting violence against women. Media depictions of violent sexual activity are also noted to increase behavioral aggression. Sexualizing imagery surfaces and reinforces misogynistic beliefs in some instances. This media can come in forms of movies, music, advertising, video games and more. Consumption of pornography has been shown to possibly encourage aggressive action as well. Positive associations between aggressive perceptions of women and consumption of pornography, especially violent pornography, have been found on multiple occasions. Individuals who more frequently consume pornography are more likely to engage in sexually aggressive acts or harbor sexually aggressive attitudes than others who consume less pornography or do not consume pornography at all. =Victim blaming and slut shaming= Victim blaming is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them. For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim their own fault. Victim blaming may also occur among a victim's peers, and college students have reported being ostracized if they report a rape against them, particularly if the alleged perpetrator is a popular figure or noted athlete. Also, while there is generally not much general discussion of rape facilitated in the home, schools, or government agencies, such conversations may perpetuate rape culture by focusing on techniques of \\"how not to be raped\\" (as if it were provoked), vs \\"how not to rape.\\" This is problematic due to the stigma created and transgressed against the already victimized individuals rather than stigmatizing the aggressive actions of rape and the rapists. It is also commonly viewed that prisoners in prison deserve to be raped and is a reasonable form of punishment for the crimes they committed. Another factor of victim blaming involves racism and racial stereotypes. Slut shaming is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behavior. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations. A study of college women from sociologists at the University of Michigan and the University of California found that slut-shaming had more to do with a woman's social class than it did with their activity. Slut shaming can create a double standard between men and women and discrimination. The SlutWalk movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.  Effects  A protester's sign refers to rape culture. Rape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as Jackson Katz, Michael Kimmel, and Don McPherson, have said that it is intrinsically linked to gender roles that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.Jackson Katz, \\"Tough Guise\\" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002 According to political scientist Iris Marion Young, victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim. Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be \\"rape free\\" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women. Others also link rape culture to environmental insecurities, where men objectify women as part of their struggle to control their immediate environment. It is also linked to gender segregation, and the belief that rape proves masculinity. Other manifestations of rape culture include denial of widespread rape, institutional apathy toward the problem of rape, minimization of rape cases by government officials, and excusing rapists as social anomalies. One concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials. The result is that men who have committed sexual assault crimes may receive little to no punishment, which serves to strengthen the rape culture in the American judicial system and American society as a whole. In addition to the law as written not being put into effect in practice, legal definitions of rape have been criticized for placing a high burden of proof on victims to demonstrate non-consent. Individuals likely use legal definitions and jury convictions in their conceptualization of ‚Äúreal rape.‚Äù Laws, which are passed by (mostly male) lawmakers, tend to represent dominant groups' interests. Larcombe et al. posit \\"a legal definition of rape as non-consensual penetration achieved through unlawful force, coercion, fraud or exploitation ‚Äì that is, containing a fault element that describes the tactic the perpetrator used to effect the assault ‚Äì may conform more closely to social and social science definitions of rape.\\" In contrast, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Kentucky, Connecticut, Arkansas, Alaska, Alabama) words alone are still not sufficient to legally prove non-consent. According to a study by Acta Obstetrecia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, of a set of \\"nearly 300 women who visited [a particular rape clinic],\\" it was found that \\"70 percent experienced at least 'significant' tonic immobility and 48 percent met the criteria for 'extreme' tonic immobility during the rape.\\" The legal process can be so traumatizing for victims that even professionals in the area would warn someone they care about against participating. = Effects on women = According to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators. For example, a number of rape myths that are held are \\"no means yes\\", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore \\"asking to be raped\\" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the \\"perpetrator\\" and want to create a type of backlash. A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a \\"slutty woman\\" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture. One effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint. Along with this were people believing women who had \\"allegedly been raped\\" were \\"asking for it\\" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior. Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman. Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen. Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physical injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape.Kilpatrick, Dean G., Heidi S. Resnick, Benjamin E. Saunders, and Connie L. Best. \\"Chapter 10 Rape, Other Violence Against Women, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.\\" Adversity, Stress, and Psychotherapy. Ed. Bruce P. Dohrenwend. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. N. pag. Print. They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault. After a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation. Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a \\"slut\\" or \\"easy\\" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them. Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions. Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others and make them feel isolated. Another effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self-reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had \\"used or damaged goods.\\" Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal \\"pure and virginal\\" stereotype that men want. Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims. If women do choose to discuss their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth. Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape. Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was \\"not a big deal\\" or \\"must not have happened.\\" Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality. Although there is a wide range of research on the consequences of sexual violence on victims, there is little information on the economic effect, especially for economically vulnerable victims such as Black and Latina women. These consequences of sexual violence disproportionately harm these specific demographics, because they make up a large portion of the group afflicted by income-poverty and asset poverty. Simply being from one of these poverty backgrounds increases the risk of sexual violence and discourages victims from reporting a rape crime as there is less confidence in the police services and there is a higher crime rate in areas of poverty. = Effects on men = \\"Toxic masculinity\\"‚Äîa concept posited by some feminist scholars‚Äîis a number of negative traits and expectations burdening men in society. Society has such strict notions regarding males and how they are supposed to act. However, when males are the victims of sexual assault people don‚Äôt normally believe it and that it cannot happen to males as normally they are the perpetrators that engage in the rape. Men are portrayed as strong, tolerant and emotionally resilient to these kinds of actions. Many of the men that are victims of rape are often blamed and told that they allowed it to happen because they did not fight hard enough. This concept of how men are supposed to act has created such strict notions of how men are supposed to present themselves. When men come forward and report the assault, they are often met with dismissal, and rejection by authority figures and medical practitioners. Often men have trouble when it comes to vulnerability and when men come forward with their assault, authority figures will often treat them little respect as their masculinity has been questioned. After a male has experienced a sexual assault, there have been many reported incidences of negative effects such as suicidal thoughts, depressive episodes, sexual dysfunctions, feelings of self- worthlessness, extreme anxiety and guilt which end up putting a strain on their future relationships. This shows that females and males have similar reactions when observing the trauma that is associated with rape victims. Sexual assault that happens upon men from other men has only been recognized as existing in prisons, however, there has been a steady incline of male rape taken place among incarcerated men. Mitchell et al., (1999) presents that male rape takes place among male college students who were either forced or pressured into sexual acts. When it comes to male sexual assault, gay men are more likely to be rape victims and will not be treated as fairly as a lesbian when it comes to the judicial system. Rumney (2009) mentions how homosexuals and the gay community are at risk of becoming rape and sexual assault victims. In addition, Rumney suggests that being labeled as homosexual, it increases their risk to be a victim of sexual assault. When a male is sexually assaulted and they are labeled as homosexual it can create negative attributes and unjust treatments towards them in by the criminal justice system. An interesting fact that Rumney found was that homosexuals males are more willing to report a rape rather than heterosexual males. Chapleau, Oswald, Russel (2008) address how we need to break down the gender differences in rape myths and learn to accept that it happens to both sexes. When it comes to how societies function on a social and ideological force, due to the fact that males and females experience the same negative effects such as rape, we need to start addressing and breaking down the rape myths. Whereas, Whatley and Riggio (1993) found that males blame the victim more than females even when the victims are males.  Prevalence  While research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States, there are a number of other countries that have been described as \\"rape supportive\\" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world. = In India = India has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as \\"damaged goods\\" who then suffer further afterwards. While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them. Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor (izzat) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister. Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth. The societal attitude of linking a woman‚Äôs celibacy with family honor compels her to safeguard the family‚Äôs honor in India. However, in the case of rape, instead of endeavoring to transform male-dominated, socially constructed, biased attitudes, people expect women to change by demanding that they dress properly or restrict their activities. Historically in India, journalistic coverage of rape and sexual abuse has been limited and typically prejudiced against the victim. Women victims who reported rape were seen as people who do not believe in preserving the honor of their family. The victim often fights a lonely battle against her tormentor where justice is not delivered timely. The increase in media coverage of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case helped to draw attention to the prevalence of sexual brutality towards women in India. According to NCRB 2015 statistics, Madhya Pradesh has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states, while Jodhpur has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities. Experts say that a woman is raped in India every 16 minutes. India, thus has been dubbed \\"the most dangerous country for women\\" by many human rights activists. = In Pakistan = Violence against women is seen as a private matter not believed to be \\"appropriate for intervention or policy changes\\". This is due to Pakistan's patriarchal society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and women to be fragile. Cultural norms also embrace violence and discrimination towards women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live alone without men. Normalization of violence against women continues to be reflected in the rates of rapes in Pakistan. Rape is not often reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders. Some Women do not come out because they want to uphold their family's honor. Victims of rape that are discovered might lose their families, their husbands and their homes. They think of themselves as \\"beghairat\\" , a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened to them and they do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by society. Women often feel discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons. A notable case occurred in 2002. 30-year-old Mukhtaran Bibi (MukhtƒÅr MƒÅ'ƒ´) was gang raped on the orders of the village council as an \\"honor rape\\" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste. In reality, he was kidnapped and sodomized by three men. Mukhar Maiai's 12-year-old brother, Abdul Shakoor (or Shakur), was abducted by three men from the Mastoi tribe, he was taken to a sugar field where he was gang raped and sodomized repeatedly. When the boy refused to stay silent about the incident, he was kept imprisoned in the home of Abdul Khaliq, a Mastoi man. When police came to investigate, Shakoor was instead accused of having an affair with Khaliq's sister, Salma Naseen, who was in her late 20s at the time. Shakoor was then arrested on charges of adultery but later released. In later trials, Shakoor's rapists were convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment. The Mastoi tribal council (jirga) convened separately regarding Shakoor's alleged affair with Naseen. They concluded that Shakoor should marry Naseen while Mai (a Gujar tribeswoman) be married to a Mastoi man. Villagers rejected this conclusion due to the belief that adultery must be punished with adultery. Mai was called to the council to apologize to the Mastoi tribe for her brother's actions. When she arrived, she was dragged to a nearby hut where she was gang raped in retaliation by 4 Mastoi men while an additional 10 people watched. Following the rape, she was paraded nude through the village . Although custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped, Mukhtaran spoke up, and pursued the case, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an anti-terrorism court sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape. = In South Africa = In a study conducted by Rachel Jewkes, Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women. Men said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for \\"fun\\" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and \\"what boys do\\". Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub- areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances. Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to \\"cleanse themselves of diseases\\". Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions. Researchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys. Rape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior. Activist Pumla Dineo Gqola says that events like the rape trial of then Vice President and now President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma are not surprising and are a reflection of ideas of masculinity and femininity in contemporary South Africa. The high rate of rape in South Africa, combined with the inability of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system to contain the crisis, have been compared to a 'gender civil war'. The majority of women in South Africa are raped by people they know. It is argued that rape in democratic South Africa has become socially acceptable and maintains patriarchal order.Helen Moffett.

Corrective rape is a hate crime committed for the purpose of converting a gay person to heterosexuality. The term was first used in the early 2000s when an influx of these attacks were noted by charity workers in South Africa.Patrick Strudwick. UK Independent.

University Rhodes University.The picture was taken at an anti-rape march during 2004. On 17 April 2016, a list of the names of 11 men and titled 'Reference List' was posted anonymously on Facebook. The post gave no descriptions or made any allegations. However, within a matter of time, students were able to connect what these students had in common which were rape allegations. The students demanded a suspension and investigation of the individuals on the list. The police were called to intervene in order to neutralize the protests at Rhodes University. This put rape in universities in the spotlight.Deborah Seddon. The Daily Maverick.‚ÄòWe will not be Silenced‚Äô: Rape Culture, #RUReferencelist, and the University Currently Known as Rhodes. With malice aforethought. 19 June 2017 14:10 (South Africa) National protest On 14 February 2012 the One Billion Rising campaign was launched globally. Its aims were to raise awareness of violence against women, to inspire action for justice and to promote gender equality. The ‚Äòbillion‚Äô in the campaign‚Äôs title refers to the UN statistic that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime: approximately one billion women and girls. Many African countries were involved in the campaign, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Often cited as one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman, South Africa‚Äôs statistics for rape and gender-based violence galvanized thousands of South Africans to rise in support of the campaign at a range of events and through various media since the campaign‚Äôs inception. On 6 August 2016, four women staged a silent protest at the IEC results announcement ceremony. The protesters said that they could not be silent given the rape and gender-based violence in South Africa. Even though President Jacob Zuma was acquitted of the charges, the young protesters says that an acquittal does not mean the president is innocent due to the failure of the legal system. Cultural values Cultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. Ukuthwala, also known as \\"wife abduction\\", is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with the intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to the marriage. There are examples of this happening in Hindu societies of India as well. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or sexual cleansing, is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically from illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such HIV/AIDS. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country. =Societies in which rape is almost non-existent = There are societies in which rape is almost non-existent, such as the Minangkabau of Indonesia.Spivak, Andrew Lawrence (2007). Dissertation: Evaluating Theories of Sexual Violence Using Rape Offenses in the National Crime Victimization Survey and the National Incident Based Reporting System. The University of Oklahoma. Department of Sociology. pp. 26‚Äì28. . According to anthropologist Peggy Sanday, rape is less likely to occur within cultures that are peaceful (have low rates of interpersonal violence), promote mutual respect between the sexes, and lack an ideology of male toughness (machismo). The society of Minangkabau has an Islamic religious background of complementarianism and places a greater number of men than women in positions of religious and political power. The culture is also matrilineal, so inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to eradicate rape without social equity of genders.  Criticisms  Some writers, academics and groups have disputed the existence or prevalence of rape culture or described the concept as harmful. Others believe that rape culture exists, but disagree with certain interpretations or analyses of it. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organization, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identified problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, \\"In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.\\" In the report, RAINN cites a study by David Lisak, which estimated that 3% of college men were responsible for 90% of campus rapes, though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape \\"has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions\\". Professor Camille PagliaTeitel, Emma (2013). \\"Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture\\", Macleans, 16 November 2013; URL accessed 16 August 2015 has described concerns about rape culture as \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"neurotic\\", an artifact of bourgeois liberal ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied with education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women she says. Paglia argues that said individuals are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply evil people in the world, who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault. Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in Time Magazine titled \\"It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria\\" suggested that \\"Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria.\\"Kitchens, C. (2014). It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria. Time Magazine, 20 March 2014. According to Joyce E. Williams, \\"the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men\\". Christina Hoff Sommers has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common \\"one in four women will be raped in her lifetime\\" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, \\"There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines.\\" Sommers and othersGilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7) have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,Christina Hoff Sommers, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women, Simon & Schuster, 1994, 22. (hb), (pb), , p. 213 while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men, even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.Robin Warshaw, I Never Called It Rape, Harper & Row, 1988 (cited here) Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.Christina Hoff Sommers, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women, Simon & Schuster, 1994, 22. (hb), (pb), Other writers, such as bell hooks, have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching \\"culture of violence\\".bell hooks, Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center, quoted in Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks, In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture. Barbara Kay, a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that \\"rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture\\" as \\"remarkably misandric\\". Jadaliyya, an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that orientalists had appropriated the term to promote racist stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men, as well as stereotypes of South Asians in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports demonizing Middle Eastern and South Asian men as \\"racially prone to rape\\" and similar tactics employed by the British as part of a racist Indophobic propaganda campaign during the 1857 rebellion casting resistance fighters as rapists. The UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape. The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.  SlutWalk  The first SlutWalk in Toronto, Ontario, 3 April 2011 SlutWalk is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made by Toronto police officer Michael Sanguinetti on 24 January 2011. While addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum, Sanguinetti said that \\"women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized\\". In addition, it also happened in India created by a group of college students to help address the violence enacted upon women. The SlutWalk happening in India shows that it is intended for women everywhere and that it should not only focus on urban women. The SlutWalk movement are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media. The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture‚Äîwhich they define as a culture in which \\"sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable\\"‚Äîand to end slut-shaming and victim blaming. One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual assault. Ringrose and Renold said that \\"the stigma relates to the way women dress and behave, but in fact male sexual aggression is the problem\\". A SlutWalk that took place in London promoted several different kinds of attire including lingerie, nipple, tassels, and T-shirts with slogans to demonstrate what women wear is not a form of consent for sex. The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors. The original SlutWalk took place in the city of Toronto, Ontario. Amber Rose is also a figure in the United States where she holds her annual Amber Rose SlutWalk in Los Angeles, California while also raising awareness for empowerment and the Amber Rose Foundation. SlutWalks have taken place in some conservative Catholic countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. According to \\"Sex and the Barrio\\" writers Edgerton and Sotirova, SlutWalk protests began in South America taking on the name \\"Marcha de las Putas\\". They are protesting the idea that women dressed in revealing clothing are asking to get raped. They held the walk in the South American capitol of Buenos Aires on 28 September 1990, a day that was named the Day for the Decriminalization of Abortion in Latin America. Due to the overwhelming Catholic influence, some SlutWalks have taken on an anti-Catholic tone in response to sermons, such as the one in Costa Rica, where a leading clergyman preached that \\"Women should dress modestly to avoid being 'objectified'\\", adding that the purpose of sex is \\"fertilization\\". The march even reached the Cathedral of San Jose just as mass was concluding.  Media Coverage  Rape culture is so prevalent within western society that it is often broadcast on social media. Media and sexual violence among individuals have been linked through social media coverage which re-enforces the notions of rape culture. Media coverage has allowed individuals the freedom to post whatever they please with little restrictions. Images that allude sexual content often demonstrate how they wish to be seen by others. This suggests that how people portray themselves online could reflect how they are treated and thus blaming the victim for inviting rape to happen. When individuals are posting provocative material about themselves it elicits a persona that reinforces the notions of gender-stereotypical ideas of being hyper-femininized. However, when there is media coverage on a case that involves rape, the reporters and news stations often sympathize with the perpetrators especially if they are younger and had a career lined up. Media coverage and reporters often pity the perpetrators because they will be forever labeled as sex-offenders, there is often little talk about the victim but rather blaming the victims.

The non-creedal church conducts programs in the areas of spirituality, social concerns, music, and arts. This church is one of two Unitarian Universalist congregations in Monroe County, the other being First Universalist Church of Rochester. The church was organized in 1829. Associated with social reform movements from its earliest days, it began attracting a group of reform activists from Quaker backgrounds in the 1840s, one of whom, Susan B. Anthony, became a national leader of the women's suffrage movement. After the first women's rights convention was held at Seneca Falls, New York in 1848, a follow-up convention, the Rochester Women's Rights Convention, was organized two weeks later at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester. Abigail Bush was elected to preside at this convention even though the idea of a woman chairing a public meeting was considered too daring even for some of the leaders of the emerging women's movement who were present. Concern with social issues has been a recurring theme in the church's history. In the late 1800s the church provided evening classes and other activities for children in the church's low-income neighborhood. At the turn of the century, church members played leading roles in the campaign to open the University of Rochester to women and in the local, state, and national campaigns for women's suffrage. In the 1930s the church provided office space for Planned Parenthood when other accommodations were difficult to find. In 1988 the church began providing classroom support to Rochester city schools. In 2006 the church initiated a program to improve the quality of life in a small township in Honduras. In 2009 it established a talk line to offer non- judgmental support to women who have had abortions. First Unitarian's building was designed by Louis Kahn and completed in 1962. It was described as one of \\"the most significant works of religious architecture of this century\\" in 1982 by Paul Goldberger, a Pulitzer-Prize-winning architectural critic. Congregation, beliefs, and programs The First Unitarian Church of Rochester in Rochester, New York, U.S., is one of the largest in its denomination, the Unitarian Universalist Association. Its senior minister is Shari Halliday-Quan. The church conducts two weekly worship services on Sundays and an occasional Saturday service. The church is non-creedal, having, in the words of its web site, \\"No single religious text. No ten commandments. No creed to which you must agree ... This respect for individual particularity and openness to diverse sources of wisdom means our community is packed with a wide array of perspectives and beliefs.\\" The church's mission statement is: \\"Creating connection by listening to our deepest selves, opening to life's gifts and serving needs greater than our own - every day!\\" The church school has a stated goal of encouraging children \\"to seek their own truths, to clarify their values, and to live lives of meaning inspired by those values.\\" The church operates on a Policy Governance system by which the board of trustees focuses on the long-term goals of the church while the parish minister oversees its operation. The board specifies the results expected from the parish minister and sets limits for his or her activities. The board does not specify how those expectations should be achieved, but it does evaluate the results. Officers of the church are elected by annual congregational meetings. In the 1970s the church developed a task force system to coordinate its activities in the area of social concerns. Members interested in a specific activity gather signatures to qualify as one of the church's task forces, which, if approved by the congregation, will be eligible to receive funds from the church budget. Oversight is provided by the Social Justice Council, which is composed largely of representatives from the task forces. Through this system, the church sponsors projects that provide classroom support for Rochester schools, temporary shelter within the church for homeless families, free Sunday suppers at a Catholic Worker program, improvements to the quality of life in a small township in Honduras, and other projects that focus on such issues as peace, reproductive rights, and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender concerns. The Council also oversees grant programs that provide financial support to community organizations. The church's music and arts programs include a choir, a house band, a handbell choir, a drama group, a chamber music series, a coffee house, and an art gallery. Interest groups sponsored by the church include Soul Matters groups that focus on monthly worship themes, several types of meditation groups, Wellspring groups with programs of daily spiritual practice, Buddhist groups, qi gong, tai chi, book discussion groups, and several types of support groups. History=Early years= The First Unitarian Church of Rochester was organized in 1829. The city of Rochester, located in western New York, was a young frontier boom town at the time, having been incorporated in 1817 and boosted by the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. The American Unitarian Association, the Unitarian national body, was also young, having been formed in 1825 by Christians who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Myron Holley Rochester Unitarians operated in the early years without a settled minister and, except for a brief period, without a church building. Informal leadership was provided by Myron Holley, a former Commissioner of the Erie Canal and one of the founders of the Liberty Party, which advocated the abolition of slavery. An early church history gave Holley primary credit for the church's establishment. In 1842 Rufus Ellis, at the age of twenty-two, agreed to come to Rochester to be the congregation's minister for a one-year period. Ellis lodged at the home of Dr. Matthew Brown, president of the congregation. Brown, who earlier was a member of the First Presbyterian Church, was one of Rochester's founders. Along with his brother, he had developed Brown's Race, the canal that delivered water power to Rochester's factory district. He also served as the first chairman of the board of supervisors of Monroe County, in which Rochester is located. Brown was an opponent of slavery; on the day in 1827 when slaves in New York State were emancipated, a delegation of African Americans visited Brown to thank him for his work to secure that legislation. Funds were raised under Ellis' leadership for a new church building that was dedicated in 1843. In a letter to his brother, Ellis noted that \\"Forty-five of the pews are already sold or rented, and are occupied by 'correct' people.\\" During Ellis' ministry the church approved a seal that contained an image of the Bible and the words \\"our Creed\\". Membership grew partly as a result of the Finney revival movement, which generated a wave of religious enthusiasm so strong in western New York that the area was sometimes called the \\"burned-over district.\\" Not all churchgoers were comfortable with the new atmosphere in their congregations, however, and some transferred to the less doctrinaire Unitarian Church. Frederick Holland, who became minister of First Unitarian in 1843, helped to stabilize the new congregation and increase its membership. He resigned in 1848 to assume leadership of the American Unitarian Association. Dissention within the Quaker community eventually led some of its members to First Unitarian. When objections were raised to abolitionist activities, about 200 people withdrew from the regional Hicksite Quaker body in 1848 and formed an organization called the Congregational Friends. This article is reprinted from Judith Wellman's \\"The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention: A Study of Social Networks\\" in Journal of Women's History 3/1 (Spring 1991), Indiana University Press This group soon changed its name to the Friends of Human Progress and ceased to operate as a religious body, focusing instead on organizing annual meetings in Waterloo, New York that welcomed anyone interested in social reform, including \\"Christians, Jews, Mahammedans, and Pagans\\". This document is a continuation sheet for the main nomination form, which contains the author's name: In July 1848, a month after the split, four women associated with the Quaker dissidents met in Waterloo with anti-slavery activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and issued a call for a Women's Rights Convention to be held a short distance away in Seneca Falls, thereby launching the modern women's rights movement. Organized on short notice, it nonetheless drew about 300 people, largely from the immediate area. Plaque commemorating the Woman's Rights Convention at First Unitarian in 1848 Momentum from this event led to the organization of another women's rights convention two weeks later at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, about west. The Rochester Convention took the significant step of electing a woman to preside, an idea that seemed so radical at the time that Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, two organizers of the Seneca Falls convention, opposed it and left the platform when Abigail Bush took the chair. She performed her duties without incident, and a precedent was established. The convention at First Unitarian was organized mainly by a circle of activists in Rochester led by Amy and Isaac Post, who had resigned from their Hicksite Quaker congregation in the mid-1840s when opposition to the Post's abolitionist activities was raised in the Quaker congregation. Several members of this circle had participated in the Seneca Falls convention, including Mary Hallowell, Catherine Fish Stebbins, and Amy Post, who convened the meeting at First Unitarian. Some of the organizers of the Rochester convention were also associated with First Unitarian, including Hallowell, Stebbins and Post. A church history written in 1929 said, \\"Our church was probably by strong majority abolitionist, an earnest group of Hicksite Quakers having attached themselves to the church as their own meeting grew inactive and faded out‚Äîthe Anthonys, Hallowells, Willises, Posts, Fishes, etc.\\" Of these families, the Anthonys were particularly significant for First Unitarian. Daniel Anthony was born a Quaker but married Lucy Reid, a Baptist, a violation of Quaker rules for which he was required to apologize to his congregation in central New York. The congregation later disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his house. Despite this patchy relationship, the Anthony children were raised as Quakers. After the Anthonys moved to Rochester in 1845, their homestead became the Sunday afternoon gathering place for progressive Quakers and other social reformers in the area. Both Daniel and Lucy Anthony attended the Women's Rights Convention at First Unitarian along with Mary, one of their daughters. Sarah Anthony Burtis, a relative, served as its acting secretary. Susan B. Anthony Susan B. Anthony, another Anthony daughter, was teaching school in central New York at the time and had little involvement with any of these activities. When she returned to Rochester in 1849, she found her family attending worship services at First Unitarian. Harper was chosen by Anthony to write her biography. She joined her family there, making it her church home and her most significant source of local connections until her death more than 50 years later. Susan B. Anthony was listed as a member of First Unitarian in a church history written in 1881. Although she no longer attended Quaker meetings in Rochester after the 1848 split, she never relinquished her membership there. Susan B. Anthony is best known as an organizer and campaigner for women's rights, but she promoted other social reforms as well. In 1851 she helped sponsor an anti-slavery convention at First Unitarian. In 1852 she helped bring 500 women to Rochester to create the Women's State Temperance Society, of which she became the state agent. In 1853 she organized a Women's Rights Convention in Rochester with the assistance of the minister of First Unitarian. In 1857 she served as clerk of the Friends of Human Progress, the social reform group created by dissident Quakers The information is on page 8 of the Proceedings in the volume for 1857. and also became upstate New York agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. She helped organize two more anti-slavery conventions in Rochester, one of which was so threatened by mob violence that she and her associates had to be escorted from the building by police for their own safety. Anthony's reform work, especially in the national campaign for women's right to vote, led her to spend most of her subsequent years on the road until advancing age required her to cut back on traveling and settle once again in Rochester. After Rev. Holland's departure from First Unitarian in 1848, the congregation entered a period of discord and short-term ministries that lasted until after the Civil War. A history of the church written in 1881 notes that some of its members during that period \\"were persons of extreme and pronounced opinions, sharply opposed to each other on political and social questions,\\" with slavery a key item of contention. There was also tension between the membership and some of the ministers of that period, not all of whom were as liberal as the congregation and one of whom went on to become a chaplain in the Confederate Army. William Henry Channing A prominent minister of First Unitarian during this unsettled period was William Henry Channing, who served from 1853 to 1854. Nationally known as a supporter of social reform, he attended the first National Woman's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850 and served on the central committee that coordinated national conventions and other women's rights activities in the following years. In Rochester he worked closely with Susan B. Anthony, writing the call for the Women's Rights Convention she organized there in 1853 and playing a leading role in it. At the 1854 New York State Women's Rights Convention in Albany, which Anthony also organized, he, along with Ernestine Rose, presented petitions to the New York State Assembly that the movement had gathered. He wrote one of the two appeals that Anthony circulated as part of her women's suffrage work in New York state. Channing wrote a brief inspirational text that has become known as \\"Channing's Symphony,\\" which reads: \\"To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly, talk gently, await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common ‚Äì this is my symphony.\\" Channing was important to the Anthony family. Mary Anthony said \\"The liberal preaching of William Henry Channing in 1852 proved so satisfactory that it was not long before this was our accepted church home.\\" Susan B. Anthony's sense of spirituality was influenced by Channing. Her friend and co-worker Elizabeth Cady Stanton said in 1898, \\"She first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her. To-day Miss Anthony is an agnostic. As to the nature of the Godhead and of the life beyond her horizon she does not profess to know anything. Every energy of her soul is centered upon the needs of this world. To her, work is worship ... Her belief is not orthodox, but it is religious.\\" Anthony expressed the latter thought in these words: \\"Work and worship are one with me. I can not imagine a God of the universe made happy by my getting down on my knees and calling him 'great.'\\" Channing had little success with his factionalized congregation. Finding that he could attract larger audiences when he spoke outside the church than within it, he even considered making a fresh start by forming a movement separate from the church. Instead he left the city for other posts, serving as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives during the Civil War. The church declined afterwards, sometimes finding it difficult to pay its ministers, none of whom served for long. In 1859 the church's building was destroyed by fire. Rochester Unitarians were once again without either minister or building, a situation that was not resolved until after the Civil War.\\" =After the Civil War= Frederick Holland, who had served as First Unitarian's minister in the 1840s, returned in 1865 as minister for an additional three years to help the congregation band together and construct a new church building, which was dedicated in 1866. The ministry of Newton Mann, who served from 1870 to 1888, was a period of stability and growth. Mann was interested in science. He owned a telescope, served a term as president of the Rochester Academy of Science and was especially interested in evolution. Mann discussed the religious significance of Charles Darwin's recently published book on evolution in a sermon delivered in Cincinnati just before the Civil War which, according to the Rochester History journal, was the first such sermon in the U.S. In 1872 Mann initiated the first public controversy over evolution in Rochester by inviting a professor to give a series of lectures on that topic at First Unitarian, which were extensively reported. In a sermon in 1874 that was also reported in the press, Mann extended the concept of evolution into the realm of religion, asserting that evolution operates on the soul as people become increasingly aware of their spiritual environment and respond by developing their spiritual capabilities. Mann supported the idea that the Bible has a human rather than a supernatural origin in A Rational View of the Bible, written in 1879, saying that a rational approach to the Bible makes it more appealing by giving it \\"a purely human quality which quite atones for all the mistakes it contains.\\" In 1870 Mann was invited to give an evening lecture at Temple B'rith Kodesh, Rochester's oldest and largest synagogue. This interfaith event, the first of its type in Rochester, contributed to a formal split between reformers and traditionalists within B'rith Kodesh and, according to The Jewish Community in Rochester by Stuart Rosenberg, \\"shook the Jewish community in America and even had reverberations abroad.\\" First Unitarian and B'rith Kodesh held a joint Thanksgiving service in 1871, and Rabbi Landsberg and Rev. Mann began the practice of exchanging pulpits, with each delivering the sermon for the other's congregation. A history of B'rith Kodesh describes the relationship between the two congregations during this period as \\"extremely close\\". In 1874 First Unitarian, B'rith Kodesh, and the First Universalist Church of Rochester began their continuing tradition of holding annual Union Thanksgiving services. In 1883 Mann helped Landsberg with part of his project to translate a new prayer book from Hebrew to English. Their translation of the song \\"Yigdal\\" has been included in the Union Hymnal of Reform Judaism and in hymnals of other denominations, including the Presbyterian Hymnal (1990). In 1884 Landsberg occupied the pulpit at First Unitarian for seven weeks while Mann was ill, attracting visitors from other denominations and, according to an early Rochester history, leading to speculation about the development of a universal church. For more information about the author of this history, William Farley Peck, see \\"Rochester History,\\" Vol VI, No. 2, page 14 http://www.libraryweb.org/~rochhist/v6_1944/v6i2.pdf The congregation of B'rith Kodesh used First Unitarian as a temporary home in 1909 after their building was destroyed by fire. In 1872 Susan B. Anthony convinced the election inspectors in her ward in Rochester that the recently enacted Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection to all citizens, implicitly gave women the right to vote. When the news spread that Anthony and her three sisters had succeeded in registering to vote, other women in Rochester also registered. Of the two dozen or so whose names are known, at least three worshiped with Anthony at First Unitarian. Mrs. Mann, the wife of First Unitarian's minister, attempted to register in her ward but was refused. On election day, only fifteen of those who had registered, including Anthony, were actually permitted to vote, and then only because the election inspector in that ward, a long-time abolitionist, defied orders and allowed them to do so. Susan B. Anthony was arrested for voting and found guilty in a widely publicized trial that generated protests across the country. In 1878 the annual meeting of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which was founded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, convened at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester on the thirtieth anniversary of the first Women's Suffrage Convention in Seneca Falls. In 1883 First Unitarian vacated its building to make way for the construction of a new post office. To replace it, the congregation purchased an existing church building from the Third Presbyterian Church of Rochester, which had moved to another location. =Gannett ministry= William Channing Gannett served as minister from 1889 to 1908. He came from a prominent Unitarian family, his father, Ezra Stiles Gannett, having written the constitution for the American Unitarian Association and served as its first secretary. William Channing Gannett himself had gained prominence as a leader of the successful movement within the denomination to end the practice of binding it by a formal creed, thereby opening its membership to non-Christians and even to non-theists. While pastor of a Unitarian church in Wisconsin before coming to Rochester, he had served as vice president of that state's women's suffrage association. Mary Thorn Lewis Gannett, Rev. Gannett's wife, was \\"very nearly his co-pastor,\\" according to a church history. Coming from a Philadelphia Quaker background, she never relinquished her membership there, attending Quaker meetings whenever she visited Philadelphia. In Rochester, however, she was active in the First Unitarian Church and assisted in the formation of several community organizations. The Gannetts focused their energy on social issues. Urging the congregation to be \\"a seven-day instead of a one-day church\\", Rev. Gannett encouraged it to become more involved with its downtown neighborhood of low- income immigrants. Advertisement for Gannett House, the church's parish house and the home of the Boys' Evening Home The Gannetts accordingly initiated the Boys' Evening Home, which opened in 1890 in the church's parish house. Within three months its membership had grown to 95 even though some of its members had to leave because they had been sentenced to the State Industrial School. By 1893 the Home had a paid superintendent and was teaching classes in manual arts and drawing, and by 1898 its offerings had expanded to include such subjects as current events, zoology, literature and journalism. A small newspaper produced by the boys campaigned against penny slot machines, which were illegal gambling devices that could be found in candy stores. The neighborhood boys came largely from Polish and Russian Jewish immigrant families. When they reached their late teens, several members of the Boys' Evening Home formed the Judean Club in Rochester, which eventually became, according to Rosenberg's The Jewish Community in Rochester, \\"the most important cultural forum in the Jewish community of that time.\\" At least four members of the Boys' Evening Home went on to become rabbis, one of whom credited Rev. Gannett with helping him choose that profession. Benjamin Goldstein, another member, became executive secretary of Temple B'rith Kodesh. Another former member, Meyer Jacobstein, was elected to the House of Representatives in Washington. Volunteers from B'rith Kodesh assisted the work of the Boys' Evening Home. Mary Gannett From 1889 to 1908 Mary Gannett led First Unitarian's Women's Alliance, through which \\"much of the church's activity was organized and executed\\". About 1902 the Women's Alliance opened the Neighborhood Friendly for Girls, which provided classes in housekeeping, cooking, and sewing for girls in the church neighborhood. The Gannetts sponsored the formation of the Unity Club in 1889, which was initiated by the Women's Alliance but was open to anyone in Rochester. With as many as a hundred members, it was divided into small classes under the tutelage of the Gannetts for the intensive study of such thinkers as Thoreau, Hawthorne, George Eliot, and the Fabians. The secretary of the Social Topics class, which examined social problems of the day, was Emma Sweet, a member of First Unitarian who was Susan B. Anthony's secretary. In 1889 Mary Gannett established the Woman's Ethical Club, an interfaith organization that discussed the ethical aspects of social topics and campaigned for the admission of women to the University of Rochester. By the middle of the 1890s, the Ethical Club was attracting several hundred women to its meetings. Other members of First Unitarian engaged in social and political work during the Gannett years. Mary Anthony, sister of Susan B. Anthony, was active in many aspects of church life and was also deeply involved with the campaign for women's rights. In 1885 a group of women gathered at her home to establish the Women's Political Club, later known as the Political Equality Club. This group of about forty women achieved several breakthroughs, including the appointment of Rochester's first police matron, the placement of women doctors on the city's health staff, and the appointment of women to state institutional boards. Mary Anthony became president of the club in 1892 and served in that capacity for eleven years. Mary Gannett was a member of the club for over twenty years and held various offices. In 1891 African American activist Hester C. Jeffrey moved to Rochester. She joined Rochester's AME Zion Church and helped organize women's clubs in the African American community. She also developed strong ties to First Unitarian, often attending services there and forming close friendships with Susan B. Anthony and Mary Gannett. She joined the Political Equality Club and created a suffrage club for African American women called the Susan B. Anthony Club. In 1895, while keeping her membership in AME Zion, she also became a member of First Unitarian. In 1891, at the age of 71, Susan B. Anthony decided to limit her work that required travel and to settle into the house she shared with her sister Mary in Rochester. She resumed routine attendance at First Unitarian, formally signed its membership book, and deepened her friendships with Rev. William and Mary Gannett. Later that year she was invited to speak at the annual Union Thanksgiving service, which was held that year at First Unitarian. Its theme was \\"The Unrest of the Times a Cause for Thankfulness\\". Anthony spoke on the women's movement. Mary and Susan B. Anthony In 1893 Susan B. Anthony became the main force behind the formation of the Rochester branch of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, which worked for the educational and social advancement of women. Mary Gannett presided at the founding meeting and became the chair of its Legal Protection Committee, often becoming personally involved in protecting working women from dishonest employers. In 1911 she became president of the organization. In 1893 Mary Anthony became corresponding secretary of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association. During the statewide drive that year for the right of women to vote in New York elections, the Anthony home was converted into campaign headquarters, with public offices in the parlor and other activities throughout the rest of the house. The campaign for women's suffrage in New York state eventually succeeded, becoming law in 1918 and providing momentum for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment nationally in 1920. In 1898 Susan B. Anthony called and chaired a meeting of 73 local women's societies to form the Rochester Council of Women, later known as the Rochester Federation of Women's Clubs. At its first meeting it renewed the campaign to elect a woman to the local school board even though women were still not allowed to vote. Mary Gannett, speaking for both the Council of Women and the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, played a major role in this campaign, which succeeded when both major parties were convinced to nominate the same woman. The Council of Women's consumer's committee, headed by Mrs. Max (Miriam) Landsberg of B'rith Kodesh and Mary Gannett, developed into the local chapter of the National Consumers League. The long campaign to open the University of Rochester to women students involved several members of First Unitarian and organizations they had helped to create. The Democrat and Chronicle, a local newspaper, writing several years after the event, said that next to Susan B. Anthony, Mary Gannett was chiefly responsible for the success of this campaign. Susan B. Anthony had formed a committee as early as 1879 to pressure the university to admit women, but without success. In 1889 the Women's Political Club renewed the campaign with a series of articles in local newspapers. During a meeting in 1891 at the Anthony home, university officials agreed to admit women if $200,000 could be raised to defray costs. The Women's Ethical Club initiated a fund-raising drive, and Susan B. Anthony and Rev. William Channing Gannett appealed for contributions at a public meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. This drive, however, was unsuccessful. In 1898 the university once again agreed to admit women if enough money could be raised and in 1899 lowered the necessary amount to $50,000. Most of that amount had already been raised, with Mary Gannett playing a leading role in that effort. Just after Susan B. Anthony returned home from a trip to Wyoming, however, she was informed the evening before the deadline that the drive was still $8000 short. With seemingly no possibility of raising additional money, and with renewed opposition among the university trustees, this drive seemed to have failed also. Determined to succeed, Susan B. Anthony, at the age of 81, rode the next morning in a carriage in a last-minute push to close the funding gap, which she accomplished by raising the entire amount from members of First Unitarian, including herself and her sister Mary. Although Susan B. Anthony worked on several local projects during this period, she remained deeply involved in national activities as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, working for an amendment to give women the right to vote. Generally known as the Anthony Amendment, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. When the Anthony sisters traveled to Berlin in 1904 for the founding of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, Susan B. Anthony was declared its first member and Mary Anthony its second. =Early to mid-1900s= Edwin Rumball Edwin A. Rumball, who served as minister from 1908 to 1915, continued the orientation toward social service that had been established in the Gannett years. In 1910 the church's parish house was expanded to provide better quarters for the Boys' Evening Home and was named Gannett House to honor Rev. Gannett, who had retired two years earlier. From 1910 to 1914 Rumball edited The Common Good, which \\"emerged as Rochester's leading journal of progressive reform\\" according to Affirming the Covenant: A History of Temple B'rith Kodesh by Peter Eisenstadt. The magazine began in 1907 as the house bulletin of the Baden Street Settlement House, which was founded by the Temple B'rith Kodesh Sisterhood to serve a neighborhood of mostly Jewish immigrants. When Rumball became editor in 1910, it expanded into a monthly journal devoted to social betterment of the city. Campaigning for such things as cleaner milk supplies and better conditions for factory workers, the publication was fatally weakened when a strike in the local clothing industry created an atmosphere of bitterness that led to a sharp decline in advertising revenues, which in turn led to the magazine's demise in 1914. Rumball became the secretary of the Rochester City Club when it was formally organized in 1910 to provide programs for weekly luncheons at a downtown hotel. Membership grew to be in the hundreds, and the programs, which included such speakers as Jane Addams and Felix Frankfurter, often made headline news. Women, who had their own Women's City Club, were expected to listen from the balcony. Mary Gannett created a stir by inviting two African American men to sit with her in the balcony who later joined the club as regular members. She was also invited to accompany two speakers to the platform: anarchist Emma Goldman and African American scholar and activist W. E. B. Du Bois. She joined the club herself when membership was opened to women in 1937. Frank Doan became the minister of First Unitarian in 1922. Formerly a professor at the Meadville Unitarian seminary, he was one of the originators of the religious humanism movement within the denomination. He retired in 1925 at the age of 48 because of ill health and died two years later. Barger is quoting from William Schulz's Making the Manifesto: The Birth of Religious Humanism, page 19. David Rhys Williams was minister from 1928 to 1958. He served as president of the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice, advocated Soviet-American cooperation, promoted the American Civil Liberties Union and supported several national legal defense campaigns. In 1933 Williams became one of the 34 signers of the Humanist Manifesto, which, among other things, declared the universe to be self-existing and not created, rejected the duality between mind and body, and called for religion to be reformed in light of the scientific spirit. Williams was an advocate of family planning and served on the executive committee of the local Birth Control League. The federal Comstock laws made it difficult at that time to be closely associated with any aspect of birth control. When Margaret Sanger, a national leader of the family planning movement, spoke at Temple B'rith Kodesh in 1932, she was arrested for answering a question from the audience about where birth control devices could be obtained. Williams preached a sermon on \\"The Spiritual Significance of Voluntary Motherhood\\" and invited Sanger to speak from the pulpit at First Unitarian a few weeks after she was arrested. A group of eight women, including Wilma Lord Perkins from First Unitarian, subsequently formed an organization that eventually became Planned Parenthood of Rochester/Syracuse. When the organization found it difficult to obtain office space elsewhere, First Unitarian provided them space in Gannett House from 1934 to 1937. In 1933 a group of Quakers began meeting in the home of Mary Gannett for the purpose of reestablishing a formal presence in Rochester, where the last Quaker organization had disbanded in 1915. The new Quaker group began holding worship services the following year in Gannett House, First Unitarian's parish house. Gannett encouraged the new organization while continuing to devote her support activities to the First Unitarian Church of Rochester. In 1940 Time magazine gave the church national publicity with an article about its ordination of James Ziglar Hanner as a Unitarian minister in an unusual ceremony that included two rabbis. Rabbi Phillip S. Bernstein of B'rith Kodesh gave Hanner his pastoral charge, basing it on the Hebrew text The Ethics of the Fathers. The service closed with the singing of Yigdal, the hymn that had been translated from Hebrew to English in 1883 by Rabbi Landsberg of B'rith Kodesh and Rev. Mann of First Unitarian. Ziglar began his ministry in Massachusetts. In 1953, during the McCarthy period, Williams' brother, Albert Rhys Williams, was accused by the House Un-American Activities Committee of having supported the Communist Party from 1919 to 1929. Rev. Williams supported his brother and criticized his attackers. Thirteen members of the congregation accused Williams of being soft on Communism and attempted to have him dismissed from the pulpit. When the issue was put to a congregational vote, the only votes against Williams were the thirteen who had made the accusation, all of whom subsequently left the church. A prominent member of First Unitarian who supported Williams during this controversy was Frank Gannett, founder of the Gannett newspaper chain, who had campaigned for the Republican nomination to run against Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential elections. In 1957 several members of the congregation formed the Rochester Memorial Society, later called the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Greater Rochester, to encourage simple rather than ostentatious funeral services. By 1975 its membership had grown to over a thousand families. As of 2011, its mailing address continued to be the same as that of First Unitarian. =New building by Louis Kahn= Louis Kahn's First Unitarian Church building In 1958 Williams announced his intention to retire after 30 years of service. Three months later, while searching for his replacement, the church was informed that a project to build a downtown shopping mall would require the space occupied by their building, forcing the church to deal with two major issues at the same time. The existing building had several deficiencies, and the church had been wrestling with problems of growth. Church committees had been investigating several alternatives including expanding the existing building, constructing a new church school, establishing daughter congregations, and purchasing the building that Temple B'rith Kodesh was vacating. The church voted to sell their building to the Midtown Plaza developers in January 1959 with the understanding that they could continue to occupy it until July 1961. Construction activity nearby, however, soon weakened the building, forcing the congregation to move in September 1959. The church held Sunday services at the Dryden Theatre of the George Eastman House until a new building could be constructed. First Unitarian's previous building was architecturally significant, having been designed by Richard Upjohn, the first president of the American Institute of Architects. The church decided to replace it with a building designed \\"by a leading 20th century architect, giving the community a notable example of contemporary architecture.\\" The congregation voted to hire Louis Kahn in June 1959 to design their new building, which was completed in 1962. =Mid-1900s to present= In 1961 the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America merged to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. The possibility of merging Rochester's First Unitarian and First Universalist churches, which had conducted a joint church school in the 1950s and whose buildings had been only a block apart before the old Unitarian church was demolished two years earlier, was considered but not acted upon. William Jenkins was minister from 1959 to 1963 and also served as president of the newly merged Unitarian Universalist Ministers' Association. Robert West was minister from 1963 until 1969, when he resigned to become president of the Unitarian Universalist Association. In 1963 the church's Social Action Committee played the key role in creating Community Interests, Inc, an organization that provided minority families with housing loans. That organization was later absorbed by the Monroe County Housing Council. In 1964 rapid growth in membership led the church to begin offering two Sunday worship services and church school sessions, with classes for older children relocated to the Harley School to ease crowding. Despite having originally informed Kahn that there would be no need to design the church to accommodate future enlargement, the church trustees decided in September 1964, less than two years after it was completed, to expand the building. Louis Kahn was hired once again as architect, and the addition was completed in May 1969. Richard Gilbert served as minister from 1970 until his retirement in 2002. Gilbert became one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II in 1973. During the 1970s Gilbert was a member of the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a group of ministers and rabbis who helped women find safe abortions at a time when it was still illegal. In 1980 Gilbert wrote The Prophetic Imperative: Unitarian Universalist Foundations for a New Social Gospel, a book used in seminars given by the denomination's Social Justice Empowerment Program. In 1983 Gilbert published the first of three volumes of Building Your Own Theology, a guidebook for examining and clarifying personal values and beliefs in a group setting. It became the most widely used adult education curriculum within the denomination. In 1982 church member Joyce Gilbert called a meeting that led to the formation of the Unitarian Universalist Musicians Network. She and Ed Schell, First Unitarian's Minister of Music, served first as members of the organizing committee and then as presidents of the new organization. With a membership of several hundred, the organization played a major role in producing the denomination's new hymnals. In 1988 the church volunteers began providing classroom support to Rochester city schools in a program called the UU/Schools Partnership. Kaaren Anderson and Scott Tayler arrived as Parish Co- Ministers in 2004. In 2006 the church began its Greater Good Project, which asks members to cut their usual Holiday spending in half and contribute the other half to community projects. In its first year the congregation contributed $79,000, part of which was used to initiate the church's Honduras Project, which works to improve the quality of life in a small Honduras township. In 2007 the church originated Wellspring, a program of spiritual deepening that has since been adopted by other Unitarian Universalist congregations. In 2009 the church's Reproductive Rights Task Force began the process of establishing a talk line to offer \\"support without judgment\\" to women who have had abortions. Staffed by church volunteers and others in the community, the talk line, which is called Connect and Breathe, began operating in 2011. It operates in the eastern part of the U.S. in conjunction with a similar talk line that was already serving the western time zones. Because of growth in membership, in 2010 the church began offering a Saturday worship service in addition to the two Sunday services.

Nnewi as a metropolitan city encompasses two local government areas, Nnewi North, Nnewi South; Nnewi North is commonly referred to as Nnewi central, and comprises four autonomous quarters: Otolo, Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi. Nnewi North also includes Ichi, an autonomous neighbouring town. The first indigenous car manufacturing plant in Nigeria is located in the city while the first wholly made-in-Nigeria motorcycle, the 'NASENI M1' was manufactured in Nnewi. , Nnewi has an estimated population of 391,227 according to the Nigerian census. The city spans over in Anambra State. Nnewi Metropolitan Area and its satellite towns is home to nearly 2.5 million residents . Dimensionally, Nnewi has an edge over all other units, being recognized by the 1953 census figures as the largest inland town of all others in the Eastern states of Nigeria.Vide the Nigerian census figures of 1996 History In Nnewi oral history and mythology, the 'ewi' () played a great role in saving the founders of Nnewi during wars. Throughout its history, Nnewi has used its military might to maintain its borders and because of this, the killing or eating of ewi in Nnewi is forbidden to the present day. Nnewi existed as an independent kingdom from the 15th century to 1904, when British colonial administration occupied the kingdom. Nnewi kingdom was founded on four quarters (large villages), namely Otolo, Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi. Each village was divided into family units called 'umunna'. Each umunna had a first family known as the 'obi'. These four quarters were these original names of the Sons of Edo: Otolo being the eldest and Nnewichi being the youngest of the sons Obi of Nnewi =The Place of Nnewi in Igbo History= Originally when the Igbos or Ibos settled in the present day Eastern Nigeria, they arrived with three leaders, two were spiritual leaders and the youngest of the three a hereditary King known as Obi a King by birthright. The first was the Eze Nri of Awka a Priest King, the second the Eze Aro of Arochukwu a King and the third the Obi of Nnewi a political and war ruler. The Obi of Onitsha was well qualified to become an Obi being disputably the first among the two sons of the Oba of Benin. The Onitsha people are visitors and later settlers in Igbo land. The Aros know this history (Nnewi being a relation and a leader among the Igbos) and this is part of the reason why there are no Aro settlements in Nnewi. The Obi of Nnewi Obi Okoli in1780s lost his throne when inside palace politics that hinged on tradition edged him out. Traditional royal law had it that the Crown Prince must perform the funeral rights of the late Obi before he can be crowned, Obi Okoli was absent and arrived home only after the late Obi Okoli 1st was buried. His Uncle (The late Obi Okoli the 1st younger brother) performed the funeral rights in his stead and took over as Igwe Nnewi he could not be enthroned as an Obi (which means the first son). The Obi Okoli royal lineage was forced into exile, they got refuge at Umune-Alam in Umudim, Nnewi where they still are to this day. The Obi Okoli family still bears the Ofor Nnewi till this day. Edo is the supreme deity of all the Alusi (Igbo: deity) in the Anaedo country. The central shrine of this unifying Alusi is at Nkwo Nnewi, the central Market. There are four other deities in Nnewi: Ana, Ezemewi, Eze and Ele. Christianity was introduced by the Europeans in 1885 and many Nnewi people now practice Christianity. Nnewi, Ichi and Oraifite made up the Anaedo state. Anaedo communities have common ancestries, beliefs and traditional value systems. Nnewi is a major trading and manufacturing center in Nigeria. Due to its high commercial activities, the city has attracted millions of migrants from other states and countries. The Ofala Nnewi is a cultural festival held every year to celebrate the coronation of the Igwe of Nnewi. Afiaolu (New yam festival) and Ikwuaru are also among traditional festivals held annually in Nnewi. Nnewi Kingdom is also known as Anaedo meaning the Land of Gold (The supreme deity and goddess of Nnewi). Geography Geographically, Nnewi falls within the tropical rain forest region of Nigeria. Though it suffers from soil leaching and erosion which has reduced the soil in some areas to a porous sandy terrain, it remains an area of rich agricultural produce and the epicenter of business trade. The city is located east of the Niger River, and about 22 kilometers south east of Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria. Government The traditional monarch of Nnewi is called the Igwe. The Igweship in Nnewi kingdom predates the arrival of Europeans, making it a unique monarchy in Igbo land. The Igbos are known for not having kings, hence the popular Igbo saying Igbo √© nwƒõ Eze, meaning 'the Igbos have no king'. In other Igbo clans, the British colonial administrators created warrant chiefs who then assumed the office and title of Igwe and are elected to this day. In Nnewi, the Igwe is the isi obi (head of the Obis) and hence the Igwe, which literally translates as the heavenly one or highness as he is the holder of the Ofo, the religious and political symbol. He is born and not made or elected, and the institution of inheritance is the traditional right and privilege. The position is neither transferable nor negotiable. He is also an Obi. Obi is the title held by ruling chiefs; it is the equivalent of a duke in the nobility. The 20th Obi of Otolo and Igwe (King) of Nnewi Kingdom, His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III The present reigning monarch is His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III; he is the longest serving monarch in Nigeria and he is currently the 20th monarch in the Nnofo Royal lineage. Igwe Kenneth Orizu III is the first class chief in Anambra state from Nnewi as well as the vice Chairman of the Anambra State House of Chiefs. The traditional rulers of Nnewi There are Obis in the four clans that make up Nnewi. The highest and the most senior obi is the Obi of Otolo, who is also the Igwe of Nnewi. Chief Afamefuna Obi, Obi Bennett Okafor and Obi George Onyekaba are the current obis of Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi, respectively. These three obis with Igwe Orizu, III as chairman constitute the Igwe-in-Council and they deliberate on the spiritual, traditional, and communal matters, in Nnewi. There is also an active town union called the Nzuko-Ora Nnewi. It is a forum through which adult Nnewi indigenes (18 years or older) can contribute to the development of Nnewi. This union was set up to encourage and promote the establishment of structures and facilities that will promote and improve the quality of life of the residents of Nnewi. =Legal system= The ancient legal system of Nnewi was not based upon a written law. It was purely a natural law, involving custom, tradition, and civil and criminal cases. The legal process in Nnewi passed through the labyrinth of extended family system. A report against an offender or a criminal in the first instance, had to be made to the head of his family at his ancestral home known as obi. The head of the family would invite elders and minor obis from his extended family unit to sit in judgment, while the complainant would also invite the elders and minor obis from his extended family side, if both of them were not from the same family. This obi would serve as the court of the first instance, depending, of course, on the nature of the offense or crime allegedly committed. The trial might end here, if both the complainant and the accused were satisfied with the judgment given, or they might take the case to the next senior obi of the same extended' family, in ascending order, until, probably, the matter got to the highest obi in the lineage. If the complainant was not satisfied at this point, he would appeal to the obi of the quarter and the leaders of his family could be summoned to defend their judgment. Through this legal procedure, guilt or innocence could easily be established, as the decision was based purely on natural justice. Punishments for offenses and criminal acts were given in relation to their gravity. A man who was found guilty of a serious crime might have no option than to be sold into slavery or expelled from the community for life. He would not be killed because the killing of human beings was against the injunction of Edo Goddess. The judicial system in Nnewi seems to have recognized three classes of cases, the minor offenses, the true criminal case, and the civil suits of debt, bride price and land. The breaking of by-laws was really an offence against some particular juju and as such was to be expiated by a sacrifice. It was, for example, forbidden to kill an \\"eke\\" snake, a type of python, or to eat \\"ewi,\\" rodent of rabbit family. It is probable these laws were never broken willingly and if broken by accident, the offender would automatically perform a sacrifice without any form of judicial trial being held. The criminal code, with regard to serious crimes, appears to have been more developed in Nnewi than elsewhere in Igboland. There were seven main classes of offences, which were known as \\"ori-obi,\\" offenses against the obi, as their investigation was always carried out in the obi of the quarter. =Politics= Nnewi has contributed its fair share of key players in Nigerian politics. A. A. Nwafor Orizu; president of the Nigerian Senate in the First Republic and later, the Acting President before the first coup d‚Äôetat of 1966, M.C.K.

See (People). Economy Agbo Edo, a forest land which belonged to Edo Nnewi deity, was cleared to make way for a new market called Nkwo Nnewi market. The development of this market propelled the fast development of the local economy. As a fast developing city and a major industrial and commercial hub in Africa, Nnewi experiences voluminous financial activities, therefore hosts major banks, and other financial institutions. Industries are dotted around the city and adjoining towns. Palm oil, cosmetics, motor, and motorcycle spare parts, books, and stationery, textiles, electric cables, and so on are produced in commercial quantity in the area. Its main trading centers include Nkwo Nnewi market (the largest spare parts market in west Africa) and Nwafor market, Eke Amaobi market, Eke Ochie, Eke Ichi Market, Orie otube Market, etc. =Agriculture and forestry= The main occupation of Nnewi people is trading and farming, therefore they depend mainly on agriculture and commerce for their daily livelihood. Most Nnewian have mbubo (home gardens) and ubi (out- station gardens) where they usually cultivate their farm products. These crops when they are harvested are usually taken to the market for sale. Most of the prime cash crops include oil palm, raffia palm, groundnut, melon, cotton, cocoa, rubber, maize, et cetera. Food crops such as yam, cassava, cocoyam, breadfruit, and three-leaf yam are also produced in large quantities. The location of Nnewi within the tropical rainforest gives it the ecological basis for production of a wide range of tropical agriculture crops with widespread potential for industrial convention. =Industries= Nnewi is home to many major indigenous manufacturing industries including Ibeto Group of Companies, Cutix and ADswitch, Uru Industries Ltd, Omata Holdings Ltd, Cento Group of Companies, Coscharis of Companies Group, Innoson Group of Companies, Ebunso Nig. Ltd, John White Industries, Ejiamatu Group of Companies, Chicason Group, Louis Carter Group, etc. The great majority of industrialists in the cluster of spare parts factories in Nnewi are also traders, and most of these traders are producing one or more of the products they specialize in marketing as traders (usually motor vehicle parts), and most began by distributing their products through their preexisting distribution networks. Nnewi is part of eastern Nigeria's industrial axis. The town has through culturally grounded institutions that act as sophisticated networks expanded to include an international dimension through trading relations with exporters from Asia. Over the last decade, the town of Nnewi has experienced relatively rapid industrialization. In excess of 20 medium-to-large-scale industries have been established across a variety of sectors. Since 1970, Nnewi residents have controlled approximately 80 to 90 percent of the motor-parts trade in Nigeria. Nkwo Nnewi Market is the major import and wholesale point for motor spare parts in Nigeria. The industrialists of Nnewi are adapting foreign technology to local needs, providing employment to thousands, and making available goods and services which are relevant actual needs of the Nigerian citizens. The first indigenous car manufacturing plant is located in the city, while the first wholly Made-in-Nigeria motorcycle was manufactured in Nnewi by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI). Auto parts Nnewi is known for the vibrant auto industry in the city, the first Igbo man to own and drive a car was SIR LOUIS OJUKWU, the father of Dim CHUKWUEMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU in 1912. By 1940, Nnewi residents were at the center of an international trading network that dominated the supply of motor spare parts in Nigeria. The town subsequently became a center for commerce and industry, and has one of the largest automotive parts markets in Africa. Nnewi Township is an authentic \\"manufacturing miracle.\\" Small and medium-sized industries have set up in the town and are producing not only for the Nigeria markets but ‚Äì albeit still to a limited extent ‚Äì for markets abroad. Industrialization of the town began around 1970 when Nnewi motor parts traders began marketing their own brand name products instead of the reproductions of \\"original\\" parts. There are several auto and motorcycle spare parts dealers in Nnewi; the Nnewi Motorcycle spare parts market is well known throughout West Africa. There is also new auto plant, the first of its kind in Nigeria, owned by an Nnewi businessman, Innocent Chukwuma, Ono and a Chinese auto Company. Culture Nnewi, as a historical city, has many cultural events and places adorned with festivities and cultural monuments, including Edo Na Ezemewi shrine, Udoogwugwu shrine (Ichi), Kamanu shrine (Ichi), and many other shrines dotted across all sections of Nnewi city. Nnewi hosts many festivals, notably amongst them is the New yam (Afiolu, also known as Ifejioku festival) which all parts of the city participates and masquerades from all federating towns participates in. The festival attracts all sorts of activities and celebrations which Nnewi residents hold in the highest esteem. In the average home of any Nnewi citizen, they usually keep kola nuts, garden egg and peanut butter in their refrigerator in case any stranger or visitor should visit their home. Every visitation to their home begins with the offering of the kola nuts to the visitor. The kola nut is indicating that the visitor is very much welcomed. The ritual of the offering of kola nut is inspired with the giving in prayers and blessing or lobby to the supreme God and other deities, for the protection of the visitor and the host. It seems to be a custom to the people of Nnewi in any of their traditional ceremonies. =Arts and crafts= Local artists thrive in this municipal rural communities. Works of art produced in the area comprises, carved doors, walking sticks of different designs, sculptures, flutes, wooden mortars and pestles, gongs, and the famous talking drums. Metal works and various types of productions are locally fashioned. =Music= The Nnewi people, just like every other Igbo group, have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, ·ªãgb√†, and ·ªãch√†k√†. Traditional marriage Igbo traditional marriage There are three types of marriages in Nnewi as also practiced across the Nigerian society: the traditional marriage held in the house of the woman; the official wedding, held in a registry office and which allows only one wife; and the religious marriage. The official marriage ceremony is called \\"Igbankwu\\", which is the Igbo word for the traditional marriage ceremony. Nnewi do not have an \\"engagement\\" ceremony. Rather, the Igbankwu is preceded by a series of events during which the potential bride's and groom's families engage each other to discuss the terms of the marriage. Perhaps this can be characterized as an engagement. Please note that Nigeria has 250 ethnic groups and each varies on marriage traditions. Further, within groups there can be even greater differentiation. =Cultural attire= Igbo women attire The traditional attire for the men is an overflowing jumper or a long-sleeved shirt worn over the gooji wrapper, which is tied around the waist, curving down to the ankles. This dress is matched with a cap and a walking stick, which aids as an instrument of support and defense. The traditional wear for the women is a blouse, worn over a loin cloth. This female attire goes with a head-tie ear rings and necklaces or traditional necklaces. =New Yam Festival= In Nnewi, the occasion of Iri-ji ohuu (new-yam eating) is a cultural festival because of its significance. Nnewi people celebrate their new yam festival usually at the end of August during which assortment of festivities mark the eating of new yam. These festivities normally include a lot of variety entertainment including performance of ceremonial rites by the Igwe (King), cultural dances by Igbo men, women and their children as well as a display of Igbo cultural activities in the form of contemporary shows, masquerade dance, and feasting at a grand scale on a wide variety of food making up the menu of the Igbos. The first day of the festival the Igwe of Nnewi will officiate the Harvest thanksgiving ceremony at his palace where the yams are offered to gods and ancestors first before distributing them to the villagers. After the prayer of thanksgiving to god, The Igwe eats the first yam because it is believed that his position gives him the privilege of being intermediaries between Nnewi communities and the gods of the land. The rituals involved in the new yam eating are meant to express the community's appreciation to the gods for making the harvest of their yams possible. This therefore explains the three aspect of Igbo worldview, that they are pragmatic, religious and appreciative. This ceremony has been celebrated for centuries and as has always presented the right conditions for all and sundry, family and friends to come together to demonstrate their commitment and solidarity to their local community. Due to this fact, the Igbos every where in the world do celebrate this event in a highly captivating manner in order to protect and celebrate the enriched cultural heritage of her people. Religion St.Cletus Catholic Church in Otolo Nnewi Religion occupies a central place in the heart of Nnewi people. This counts for the huge churches and religious practices in the city. The people of Nnewi are 96% Christian, with small fractions of other faiths: 2% traditionalist, 0.2% Jews, 0.3% Muslims and 1.5% others. Among the Christian community, the catholic and Anglican Communion shares a greater number of followers followed by other Pentecostal Christian groups. Christianity first came on the Southeastern part of Nigeria with the arrival of the Holy Ghost missionaries from Gabon to Onitsha under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Lutz late on Saturday December 5, 1885. Fr. Joseph Shanahan (The Apostle of Igboland) joined them in 1902 and when the mantle of leadership fell on him in 1905, history was set to record the evangelization of Roman Catholic Diocese of Nnewi. The stream of this evangelization was to flow through two main courses almost concurrently: one having Nnewi as its source and the other Ozubulu/Ihiala. Though individuals from various communities have come in contact with the faith as they traveled to Onitsha and other places for trade and in quest of western education, the actual planting of the seed of the gospel in Nnewi Diocese from the Catholic perspective sprang from the treks of Fr. Victor Duhaze to Ozubulu through Oguta (1906) and to Nnewi through Umuoji, Ojoto Mili Agu down to Odida Nnewichi in 1906. However, the Anglican Church was established in Nnewi from Obosi in 1893. But the seed of what is today Nnewi Diocese was sown in 1809. Requests were made by Odida. Community in Nnewichi inviting Fr. J. Shanahan. In the same year, some Ozubulu indigenes had registered the same requests for establishing a Church station at Ozubulu. Nnewi people are proud of there traditional Odinani as well as the new religion of Christianity. @(Note:The Church Missionary Society CMS under the leadership of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and Reverend Henry Townsend arrived Onitsha on July 27, 1857) Social issues=Health= Nnewi hosts a number of institutions and places of learning and healing, which include Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) and a number of international agencies. The Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, is in the forefront of providing excellent health services to the nation. The hospital and its annexes since inception has provided specialized and comprehensive medical care to the immediate community and beyond. Its mandate also includes undergraduate and postgraduate medical and paramedical training as well as research. These services have grown from strength to strength through the years fueled by comprehensive annual plans approved by the Federal Government. =Education= The ancient city of Nnewi hosts a number of traditional and formal learning institutions and places of learning, which include a Medical University: Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) Government secondary schools: Okongwu Memorial Grammar School, Maria Regina Secondary School, Nnewi High School, Ichi Technical School (Ichi Community), Ichi Girls, Akoboezemu Community Secondary School, Anglican Girls Secondary School, Nnewi- Ichi Community Secondary School etc. Private schools: Summit International School, The Good Shepherd School, New Era School, Dr. Alutu's College of Excellence School, christ the king, etc. =Crime= Crime rates are low but civil disputes such as land ownership and family inheritance exist. In more recent times, the market square and banks have experienced well publicized and organized criminal attacks that have been allegedly linked to the local police. There are now open debates on reinstating a local vigilante crime fighting group called the Bakkassi Boys,Crackdown on Nigerian vigilantes http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2181337.stm who had a multi-year stint in Nnewi in the late 1990s when crime was on the increase. This group had a modus operandi that many considered barbaric but necessary ‚Äì convicted thieves were killed in public by dismembering their body parts with a sharp machete and burning them alive. The activities of this group of men which had permission of the Governor of the state was seen by the Human rights activists and civil right movement as a violation of human rights and campaigned against their practices. Recently, Nnewi is relatively peaceful except for isolated occurrences of kidnapping of prominent local citizens for large ransoms.

She is largely viewed sympathetically by historians as an unassuming and benevolent if overly doting woman who suffered much in her long life, who tried to influence the empire as well as she could, and who was not a party to her nephew's machinations, but whose failure, leading to the downfall of the Western Han Dynasty, was her overdependence on her clan (the Wangs). Early life Wang was born the second daughter of Wang Jin, the then-Minister of Justice and Lady Li.Ban & Ban (111), Yuanhouzhuan. Although she was one of 12 children, only Wang and two brothers were born to Lady Li. Her parents tried to find Wang a husband; her suitors expired before their plans came to fruition. One suitor was the Prince of Dongping, but he died before the marriage. After this, Wang dedicated herself to studying books and playing the guqin. At age 18, she entered the palace as a palace woman, in the service of one of the imperial concubines. Consort Sima, the favorite consort of Crown Prince Liu Shi died from an illness. Crown Prince Shi was grief-stricken, became ill, and refused to see any of his concubines. His father, Emperor Xuan, suggested that Empress Xiaoxuan select palace women to attend the crown prince, as all the crown prince's concubines were so disagreeable. Wang was one of the palace women presented to the crown prince, among five others. The crown prince selected Wang, allegedly solely by the fact that she was seated closest to him at the time of selection. Three years after, Wang gave birth to a male child, Ao, whereas none of the crown prince's previous concubines had. Empress In 49 BC, Emperor Xuan died, and Crown Prince Shi became emperor. He made Consort Wang empress, and her son his heir apparent. Wang's father was created the Marquess of Yangping, a title later inherited by Empress Wang's brother Wang Feng (ÁéãÈ≥≥), who would later play a large role in government. Emperor Yuan was a relatively non-womanizing emperor, but he did have two favorite concubines in addition to Empress Wang‚ÄîConsort Fu (ÂÇÖÊò≠ÂÑÄ) and Consort Feng Yuan (È¶ÆÊò≠ÂÑÄ), each of whom bore him one son. Empress Wang apparently tried to maintain a cordial relationship with both, and she was largely successful, at least as far as Consort Feng was concerned. However, a struggle between Empress Wang and Consort Fu for their sons' heir status would erupt. As Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with his fitness as imperial heir and impressed with Consort Fu's son, Prince Liu Kang of Shanyang (Â±±ÈôΩÁéãÂäâÂ∫∑). Several incidents led to this situation. One happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan's youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±ÁéãÂäâÁ´ü) died, Emperor Yuan became angry when he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was insufficiently grieving‚Äîparticularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmates‚Äîand showing insufficient respect to Prince Jing. Prince Ao's head of household Shi Dan (Âè≤‰∏π), a relative of Emperor Yuan's grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from overgrieving, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown. As the princes further grew, several things further led to an endearment between Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang. They shared affection and skills in music‚Äîparticularly in the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan grew ill circa 35 BC‚Äîan illness that he would not recover from‚ÄîConsort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. In his illness, apparently encouraged by Consort Fu, Emperor Yuan reconsidered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead. Only the intercession of Shi Dan led Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng). Empress Dowager After the death of Emperor Yuan and the accession of Emperor Cheng, Empress Wang became empress dowager. Prince Kang, as was customary with imperial princes, was sent to govern his principality‚Äînow at Dingtao (ÂÆöÈô∂). Despite the near-coup by Consort Fu and Prince Kang, however, Empress Wang and Emperor Cheng did not bear grudges, and, against the advice of officials who were concerned that Prince Kang would become the subject of conspiracies, Emperor Cheng often summoned Prince Kang to the capital Chang'an for extended visits. As empress dowager, Empress Dowager Wang was kind but overly doting on her son and her brothers. Emperor Cheng was very trusting of his uncles (Empress Dowager Wang's brothers) and put them in important roles in government. In addition to Wang Feng, who had inherited his father's title as the Marquess of Yangping, six of Empress Dowager Wang's brothers were created marquesses, in violation of the rule laid by Emperor Gao, the founder of the dynasty, who had decreed that only those who had contributed to the empire in substantial ways could be made marquesses. Several (Wang Feng, Wang Shang (ÁéãÂïÜ), and Wang Gen (ÁéãÊ†π)), in addition to Empress Dowager Wang's cousin Wang Yin (ÁéãÈü≥), served successively as the supreme commander of the armed forces and were in effective control of the administration. After Wang Gen, Empress Dowager Wang's nephew Wang Mang served in the same role. * Wang Feng, 33 BC‚Äì22 BC * Wang Yin, 22 BC‚Äì15 BC * Wang Shang, 15 BC‚Äì12 BC * Wang Gen, 12 BC‚Äì8 BC * Wang Mang, 8 BC‚Äì7 BC The Wangs, while not corrupt in general and apparently genuinely trying to help the emperor, were largely concerned with aggrandizing their power and not with the best interests of the empire when selecting officials for various posts, and this led to a continued deterioration in the administration of Emperor Cheng, who at times considered modifying this power structure but always failed to do so. For example, in 24 BC, under the suggestion of an official Wang Zhang (ÁéãÁ´†, unrelated to the Wang clan), Emperor Cheng considered replacing Wang Feng with highly regarded official Feng Yewang (È¶ÆÈáéÁéã), the brother of his father's concubine Consort Feng. When Wang Feng realized this, Empress Dowager Wang became saddened, and in response Emperor Cheng executed Wang Zhang and relieved Feng Yewang of his post without any allegation of wrongdoing. =Succession issue= Emperor Cheng was a womanizer with many favorites. His first favorite was Empress Xu (created 31 BC), from the clan of his murdered grandmother, the first wife of Emperor Xuan. He also favored Consort Ban. Neither Empress Xu nor Consort Ban bore him a child, however, and concerned with having a grandson to be heir, Empress Dowager Wang openly encouraged Emperor Cheng to take on more and more concubines, but that did not result in the birth of an heir. Circa 19 BC, however, when Emperor Cheng was visiting the Princess of Yang'a (ÈôΩÈòøÂÖ¨‰∏ª), he became enamored with her dancing girl Zhao Feiyan (Ë∂ôÈ£õÁáï) and her sister Zhao Hede (Ë∂ôÂêàÂæ∑) and made them his concubines, and they became favored over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BC, the Zhao sisters falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of practicing magic; Empress Xu was deposed, and while Consort Ban was able to successfully plead her case, she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang. Emperor Cheng wanted to then create Zhao Feiyan as empress, but Empress Dowager Wang complained about her low birth and prior occupation as a dancing girl; she finally capitulated to her son's wishes in 16 BC, but she was never pleased with the Zhao sisters. Neither the Zhaos nor another later favorite of Emperor Cheng's, Consort Li, bore him a son either, however. In 9 BC, still heirless, Emperor Cheng appeared to come to the resolution of making either his younger brother Prince Liu Xing of Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±ÁéãÂäâËàà) or his nephew Prince Liu Xin of Dingtao (ÂÆöÈô∂ÁéãÂäâÊ¨£, Prince Kang's son) his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin's grandmother Consort Fu was endearing herself to the Zhaos and Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC. Emperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdosage of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede). Immediately there were many rumors that he had in fact had concubines who bore him sons, but that those sons and their mothers were murdered by Consort Zhao Hede (out of jealousy) and possibly Emperor Cheng himself. Grieving her husband and apparently fearful of reprisal, Consort Zhao Hede killed herself. Crown Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. A report by officials commissioned by Empress Dowager Wang concluded in 6 BC that Emperor Cheng did have two sons‚Äîone born to Consort Cao in 12 BC and one born to Consort Xu (a relative of the deposed Empress Xu) in 11 BC. However, both of the sons were murdered in their infancy by orders of Consort Zhao Hede, with at least tacit agreement from Emperor Cheng, who was enamored with her; Consort Cao was forced to commit suicide after her son was murdered. In response, apparently at the urging of Empress Dowager Wang, Emperor Ai stripped the Zhaos' relatives of their marquess titles and exiled them; only Empress Zhao Feiyan was spared (for the time being). Grand Empress Dowager When Emperor Ai ascended the throne, Empress Dowager Wang received the title that she is later most known for‚ÄîGrand Empress Dowager Wang. Initially, out of respect for her, Emperor Ai, while consolidating his own power base, left the Wangs, including Wang Mang, largely in the posts that they had been in. However, the influences of Emperor Ai's grandmother Consort Fu would soon be shown. Consort Fu was not content with her title of Princess Dowager of Dingtao; rather, she also wanted to be empress dowager. Grand Empress Dowager Wang was willing to let her have the title, and it was by her edicts that Consort Fu was also given the title Grand Empress Dowager (with a difference‚ÄîFu had the unique title, not again to be used, of Ditaitaihou (Â∏ùÂ§™Â§™Âêé) compared with Wang's regular title of Taihuangtaihou (Â§™ÁöáÂ§™Âêé)); in an analogous manner, Emperor Ai's mother Consort Ding was also given the title of Empress Dowager (Ditaihou, Â∏ùÂ§™Âêé; cf. Zhao Feiyan's title of Huangtaihou, ÁöáÂ§™Âêé)). Consort Fu was not content with titles, however, but did everything she could to control her grandson's administration. Part of her agenda involved the removal of the Wangs from government. Grand Empress Dowager Wang had no desire to contend with Fu, however, and voluntarily ordered members of the Wang family to resign and turn over power to the Fus and the Dings. Her humility and willingness to yield greatly impressed the people and the officials in government, and as the incompetence of Emperor Ai became apparent, the people and the officials‚Äîwho were largely against the Wangs during the reign of Emperor Cheng‚Äîall clamored for the return of the Wangs. This yearning came partly from a thorough miscarriage of justice perpetrated by Consort Fu in 6 BC when she, still bearing a grudge from her struggles with her former romantic rival Consort Feng Yuan (who by that time was Princess Dowager of Zhongshan and the grandmother of Prince Liu Jizi of Zhongshan), falsely accused Consort Feng of practicing magic, forced her to commit suicide, and executed and exiled a large number of her family. In response, in 2 BC, Emperor Ai recalled Wang Mang to the capital to attend to Grand Empress Dowager Wang. In 1 BC, Emperor Ai died without an heir, and this left the imperial household in immediate turmoil‚Äîduring which Grand Empress Dowager Wang would play an important role. Wang Mang's usurpation When Emperor Ai died, his male favorite (commonly believed to be homosexual lover) Dong Xian was in command of the armed forces and was the most powerful official in government, and there was great uncertainty what was going to happen next. It was at this time Grand Empress Dowager Wang would play the most crucial role in her life. She decided to immediately proceed to the imperial palace and seize the imperial seal and summon Dong. Her move caught Dong by surprise, and he was paralyzed and unable to act. Grand Empress Dowager Wang summoned Wang Mang to the palace as well and transferred the command of the imperial guard from Dong to Wang Mang. Dong, fearful of what was going to happen next, killed himself. Wang Mang immediately moved to remove all obstacles to power, but at the same time maintaining an appearance of faithfulness to the Han Dynasty. With Grand Empress Dowager Wang's assent, he removed the Fus and Dings from government, and without her knowledge, he dishonored Consort Fu's and Consort Ding's graves. Grand Empress Dowager Wang then summoned her remaining stepgrandson Prince Jizi to the throne, as Emperor Ping. During Emperor Ping's reign, Wang Mang served as regent, with Grand Empress Dowager Wang's support. When in her presence, he did everything he could to convince her of his faithfulness to the Han Dynasty and also flattered her, but at the same time continued to purge the government of potential enemies and getting his associates to use propaganda to create an aura of holiness about him. In 1, convinced of her nephew's faithfulness, Grand Empress Dowager Wang created him Duke of Anhan (ÂÆâÊº¢ÂÖ¨, literally \\"Duke who made Han secure\\")‚Äîeven though previously there had not been a single duke created in Han history. In 2, when selecting an empress for Emperor Ping, Grand Empress Dowager Wang initially ordered that girls from the Wang clan be excluded, but Wang Mang immediately mobilized a mass of petitioners to surround the palace, urging her to make his daughter empress. Grand Empress Dowager Wang relented and selected Wang Mang's daughter to be Emperor Ping's empress, and she was created as such in 4. In 3, another major event happened that greatly increased Wang Mang's power. Wang Mang's son Wang Yu (ÁéãÂÆá), dissatisfied with his father's dictatorial rule, conspired with Emperor Ping's maternal uncles, the Weis, against Wang Mang. When their conspiracy was discovered, Wang Mang had not only Wang Yu and the Weis (except Consort Wei) put to death, but also used this opportunity to accuse many actual or potential political enemies as being part of the conspiracy and to execute or exile them. This included even his own uncle Wang Li (ÁéãÁ´ã), whom he forced to commit suicide by forging an edict from Grand Empress Dowager Wang, from whom he hid the truth (and instead told that Wang Li had died of an illness). Wang Mang made Grand Empress Dowager Wang feel as if she were in control of the situation, however, by arranging for her to periodically survey the areas around the capital Chang'an to reward people with money and goods and to visit orphans and widows. He also ingratiated himself to her by building an impressive temple for her husband Emperor Yuan. In 5, Wang Mang poisoned Emperor Ping after becoming concerned that Emperor Ping was going to take vengeance for Wang Mang's executing of his uncles. He also began to lift the fa√ßade of faithfulness to the Han in Grand Empress Dowager Wang's presence, effectively forcing her to grant him the title of acting emperor (ÂÅáÁöáÂ∏ù) against her wishes and to approve his selection of Liu Ying, a great- great-grandson of Emperor Xuan, as the new emperor (as Emperor Ruzi). In 8, Wang Mang usurped the throne and established the Xin Dynasty. When he demanded that Grand Empress Dowager Wang turn over the imperial seal, she initially refused, but eventually relented. Reign of Wang Mang Tomb of Wang Zhengjun in Weiling (Ê∏≠Èôµ), Xianyang, Shaanxi Wang Mang initially wanted to abolish Grand Empress Dowager Wang's title and give her a new title, but she immediately indicated that she was greatly offended at his suggestion. In response, he kept her title but gave her an additional one‚ÄîWenmu (ÊñáÊØç), implying that she was a cofounder of his dynasty. She never acknowledged the new dynasty, and when Wang Mang changed the calendar and the holidays as well as the uniform of the imperial household attendants, she ordered her ladies in waiting to continue to observe the Han calendar and wear the Han uniforms. He tried to attend to her needs earnestly to try to please her, but his attempts failed. Circa 12, Wang Mang destroyed Emperor Yuan's temple and built another one, intended for Grand Empress Dowager Wang after her death. When she found out that her husband's temple had been destroyed, she was greatly saddened and cursed Wang Mang. She died in the spring of 13, and Wang Mang buried her, as was customary, in the same tomb as Emperor Yuan, but dug a trench between her and Emperor Yuan.

It was at Humen that Lin Zexu supervised the destruction of large quantities of seized opium in 1839. Some major battles in the First Opium War were fought here and on the waters of the Bocca Tigris. Economy Humen is a thriving city crowded with consumer goods factories. These factories also fueled population expansion from emigrating workers around the country seeking factory jobs. Furthermore, Humen is geographically advantageous for the factories due to its proximity to two large metropolitan cities and export harbors of Hong Kong and mainland China's Shenzhen. Humen has long been an important gateway to south China. Going upstream, ships plying the Pearl River can reach the eastern, northern and western regions of Guangdong and even parts of Guangxi province. The main port, Humen Port, is a first-class port open to foreign vessels.

Born in Ankober, in Shewa Province, to Feleketch Yamatawork and Tekle Mamo, Afewerk grew up under the Italian occupation during the Second World War. Following the war in 1947, Afewerk decided that he wanted to help rebuild Ethiopia and elected to travel to England to study mining engineering. Before departing, Afewerk, together with other students leaving to study overseas, was addressed by Emperor Haile Selassie. Afewerk recalls being told \\"you must work hard, and when you come back do not tell us what tall buildings you saw in Europe, or what wide streets they have, but make sure you return equipped with the skills and the mindset to rebuild Ethiopia\\". Afewerk had already shown talent as an artist as a child, decorating several walls in his home town. Whilst at boarding school in England, this talent was recognised and encouraged by his teachers. As a result, Afewerk was persuaded to switch from engineering and enroll in Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He then went on to the Slade School of Art where he studied painting, sculpture and architecture. Returning to Ethiopia as a university graduate, Afewerk could have accepted an assigned ministerial post, but instead decided to spend time travelling around the provinces of Ethiopia to get more experience of his native country and culture, which he reflected in his paintings. In 1954, he held his first one- man show in Addis Ababa, at Municipality Hall, that gave him the funds to travel around Europe for two years where he learnt how to design and construct stained glass windows. He also made a special study on Ethiopian illustrated manuscripts in the British Library, the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris and the Vatican Library. Back in Ethiopia, Afewerk opened a studio in the National Library of Ethiopia. His growing recognition lead to government commissions for murals and mosaics in St George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa, and several of his designs were used on the national stamps. He was also commissioned to produce sculptures of famous Ethiopians, although only the monumental statue of Ras Makonnen in Harrar was completed. Most notably, in 1958 he designed Total Liberation of Africa, a stained glass piece in the Africa Hall of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa. The three windows cover an area of 150 square meters, and represent the sorrow of Africa's past, the struggle of the present, and hope for Africa's future. In 1961, Afewerk held a major retrospective in Addis Ababa, which led to his painting Maskal Flower being shown at international exhibitions in Russia, the United States and Senegal. Increasing funds allowed Afewerk to travel around the continent of Africa. With much of Africa still emerging from colonialism, Afewerk became fired with black emancipation and the struggles for independence. This is reflected in his paintings of this time, with titles like Backbones of African Civilization and African Unity. In 1964, he became the first laureate of the Haile Selassie I Prize for Fine Arts. As his reputation spread abroad, Afewerk was invited to put on an exhibition in Moscow following which he toured the Soviet Union giving lectures. The American government responded with an invitation for one man exhibitions in Washington D.C. and New York and a similar lecture tour of American universities. Additional international exhibitions followed in Senegal, Turkey, Zaire, the United Arab Republic, Bulgaria, Munich, Kenya and Algeria. Through much of the 1970s, Afewerk was engaged in producing murals and mosaics for many public and religious buildings around Ethiopia, including the mural Last Judgement in the Adigrat Cathedral in Adigrat, Tigray. In 1977, his painting Unity Triptych won the gold medal in the Algiers International Festival. The early 1980s saw a second major exhibition in Moscow and an exhibition in Bonn. In 1981, his painting Self-portrait was the first work by an African artist to enter the permanent collection of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy. In 1997, he exhibited at the Biennale of Aquitaine, France, winning first prize in the international competition. He was also nominated as the Laureate of the Biennale which gave him membership of the French International Academy of Arts. Afewerk Tekle had membership of the Russian Academy of Arts, so he became the first African member in 1983. Death Afewerk Tekle died on 10 April 2012 from severe stomach ulcer complications after receiving treatment at a private hospital in Addis Ababa and was buried at the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Cathedral at Addis Ababa. Afewerk's death received wide media coverage in the country, with a national committee- arranged funeral.

It was owned by Live Nation and had a capacity of 17,137. It had previously been owned by SFX Entertainment and Clear Channel Worldwide, both predecessors of Live Nation. Background The venue was the idea of Steve Moore, former CEO of the Country Music Association. Moore began working for PACE Concerts, in Houston booking acts for AstroWorld and Six Flags Over Texas. In 1985, Moore moved to Nashville in hopes of opening a venue tailored to acts like The Beach Boys, Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band and the Eagles. The amphitheater broke ground November 11, 1985. In June 1986, the amphitheater opened as Nashville's premier outdoor venue. Venue information Located in the Nashville suburb of Antioch, the amphitheatre featured one large stage, a covered pavilion with reserved box seating, and an open-air grassy area for general admission seating. A much smaller stage was located near the venue's north entrance and usually featured local bands entertaining audiences as they entered the venue. For larger music festivals, a temporary third stage would be erected in a fenced area normally used as a parking lot. Starwood regularly hosted most of Nashville's summer concerts featuring A-list artists from all genres of music. The typical season, which generally ran from April to October, featured 20 to 25 events. Starwood was criticized for the lack of sufficient road infrastructure in the area. Though within two miles (3 km) of Interstate 24, Starwood was located along Tennessee State Route 171 (Old Hickory Blvd), a two-lane road in a primarily residential and industrial neighborhood. It was also located along U.S. Route 41 (Murfreesboro Road), a four-lane highway that does not intersect a freeway in the immediate area. Therefore, larger crowds would result in major traffic problems both before and after events. Event attendees often faced hours before and after events waiting in the traffic on the two lane road location of the main venue entrance. Aggressive security policies, such as preventing any consumption of alcohol in the parking lots before concerts, led to many concert-goers boycotting the venue through the 1990s and up to the time of its closure. Starwood Amphitheatre was not affiliated with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Naming rights AmSouth Amphitheatre logo, 2000‚Äì2003 After opening as Starwood Amphitheatre in 1985, the venue went through several name changes in its later years. Prior to the 1999 season, naming rights were sold to locally based First American National Bank for five years, and the venue was renamed First American Music Center. That October, First American National Bank merged into Alabama-based AmSouth Bancorporation. AmSouth agreed to assume the naming rights upon the merger, and after just one season with its new name, the venue was renamed AmSouth Amphitheatre in 2000. AmSouth declined to extend the naming rights agreement past the initial five-year deal, and without a new suitor, the venue reverted to its original name in 2004. Closing On February 13, 2007, Live Nation announced its intention to close Starwood Amphitheatre and cancel the 2007 season in anticipation of a potential sale, despite an earlier statement that the 2007 season would take place as scheduled. Entertainment industry insiders blame the closing on Starwood's age and size, calling it a \\"first-generation\\" outdoor venue that was only about two-thirds the size of the ones being built today and one that lacked now-standard amenities for both patrons and performers, therefore not able to attract the top-tier artists who demand larger, more modern performance venues. Starwood grossed only $4.6 million in ticket sales during the 2006 season and was one of four underperforming venues that Live Nation put up for sale following the season. Only two events were scheduled for 2007 before the announcement to close the venue: The Charlie Daniels Band's annual Volunteer Jam, and a Brad Paisley/Kellie Pickler show. The last show at Starwood featured Aerosmith and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, two bands who had played there many times over the years. Demolition and beyond The Starwood offices and concession areas were demolished during the last half of September 2007, culminating with the dynamite demolition of the stage, seating area, and dressing rooms on September 29, 2007. Live Nation announced on April 30, 2007 that the buyer of the Starwood property is Vastland Realty Group. Plans for the site were revealed the following November, when Vastland announced a $100 million mixed-use residential and commercial development named \\"Starwood Commons\\" that will feature of retail space and 250 multi-level townhomes. More than three years later, the site had not been cleared, and the landscape remained much the same as it did following demolition of the structures. In October 2010, the current owner of the site petitioned to allow live concerts on the site as the original development plans had fallen through due in part to the late-2000s recession. In December 2010, Nashville rock band August Christopher performed on the still standing, concrete stage, shooting a music video for their song \\"Down\\", which was nominated for NIMA's (Nashville Independent Musician's Association) \\"Video of the Year\\".http://www.augustchristopher.com/ Years later, the band got retroactive permission from Vastland Realty in response to a documentary titled \\"All or Nothing\\". http://a.co/7Uq2AFK Real estate developer Vastland Realty announced plans to return concerts to the site beginning as soon as Summer 2011 using a temporary stage and seating, but the plans never came to fruition. After defaulting on the loan, Vastland Realty lost the property to foreclosure. It was purchased out of foreclosure by Orange Murfreesboro, LLC in 2013 for . , the site remains undeveloped and appears much as it has since the venue's 2007 demolition.

After a long period with the Canadian National Railway, it is now operated by the New England Central Railroad. The New London Northern was the only through railroad in Connecticut not to come under the control of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. History The New London, Willimantic and Springfield Railroad was chartered in May 1847 to build from New London on the Long Island Sound north through Willimantic to Springfield, Massachusetts. On April 10, 1848, the name was changed to the New London, Willimantic and Palmer Railroad with the shift of the north terminus to Palmer. The first section, from Norwich north to Willimantic, opened in September 1849, and the part from Norwich south to New London opened the next month. The part north to Stafford opened in March 1850, and the rest of the way to Palmer opened in September of that year. A steamship line continued from New London to New York City via the Long Island Sound. The Amherst and Belchertown Railroad was chartered on May 24, 1851. Construction began on April 23, 1852, and the full line opened May 9, 1853, from Palmer north to Amherst via Belchertown. It went bankrupt in 1857, was sold at auction on October 14, 1858, and was reorganized on November 23 of that year as the Amherst, Belchertown and Palmer Railroad. The New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic and Palmer on April 1, 1861. In March 1864, it bought the Amherst, Belchertown and Palmer, extending the line north to Amherst. An extension north to Millers Falls on the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad opened in 1867. On December 1, 1871, the Central Vermont Railroad leased the New London Northern and made it its Southern Division. The connection between the two lines was made over the Vermont Valley Railroad and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad's Brattleboro Branch. The Ware River Railroad opened in stages from 1870 to 1873, running from Palmer north to Winchendon. It was leased to the New London Northern until April 1, 1873, when the Boston and Albany Railroad took it over. On May 1, 1880, the New London Northern bought the branch of the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad from Millers Falls north to Brattleboro, part of its original main line, extending the line north to Brattleboro. Just prior to that lease, in February, the narrow gauge Brattleboro and Whitehall Railroad was leased, providing a branch from Brattleboro northwest to a dead end at South Londonderry (never extended as planned to Whitehall, New York). In 1896, the Grand Trunk Railway bought the Central Vermont. The Grand Trunk was merged into the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The Brattleboro and Whitehall Railroad went bankrupt and was foreclosed in March 1905. The West River Railroad was chartered in May of that year as a reorganization, and the line was converted to . On February 3, 1995, the New London Northern's line became part of the New England Central Railroad, a regional railroad from New London north to East Alburg, Vermont. This change in operation was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission on December 9, 1994. Branches ;Palmertown The Palmertown Branch ran west from Montville, Connecticut to Palmertown. ;Fitchville The Fitchville Branch ran from Fitchville Junction, in the northwest part of Norwich, Connecticut, west to Fitchville. ;Flynt's Granite The Flynt Granite Company built the Flynt's Granite Branch Railroad to their quarries in Monson, Massachusetts. It was owned and operated by the granite company. Passenger service As noted above, the Central Vermont Railway bought the NLN. The latter's passenger service appeared on 20th century passenger timetables as a division of the Central Vermont Railway. The CV continued passenger service on the Brattleboro - Amherst - Palmer - Norwich - New London route until September 27, 1947. The Mansfield stop provided the nearest point of rail access to the University of Connecticut at Storrs.Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Pepperell Massachusetts, 2005, pp. 104 In 1989 passenger service was restored on the line when Amtrak rerouted the Montrealer over the line, however, only with stops between the Atlantic Coast and the Vermont border being New London, Amherst and Palmer. (In 1991 Willimantic was added as an intermediate stop.) However, service on the line was eliminated in 1995.

The Byzantine Empire had a great influence on the culture; Serbs were initially governing the Byzantine and Frankish frontiers in the name of the emperors and were later through their sworn alliance given independence, baptized by Greek missionaries and adopted the Cyrillic script, with Latin and Catholic influences in the southern regions. The Serbian Orthodox Church gained autocephaly from Constantinople in 1219, whereas Stefan the First Crowned was declared king by the Pope. The Republic of Venice influenced the maritime regions in the Middle Ages. The Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia in 1459 and ruled the territory for several centuries, the consequences of which suppressed Serbian culture but also greatly influenced Serbian Art, especially in the southern regions. Meanwhile, in northern regions Habsburg Monarchy expanded into modern Serbian territory starting from the end of the 17th century, culturally bounding this part of the nation to Central Europe rather than Balkans. Central Serbia was the first to emancipate as the Principality of Serbia in 1815, and started to gradually expand into Ottoman and Habsburg- held regions. Following Serbia's autonomy after the Serbian Revolution and eventual independence, the culture of Serbia was restrengthened within its people. Life=Religion= Cathedral of Saint Sava is one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world and a major symbol of Belgrade Notable medieval fresco Bathing of the Christ, a part of UNESCO world heritage site Our Lady of Ljevi≈°, burned down in 2004 unrest in Kosovo Conversion of the South Slavs from Slavic paganism to Christianity began in the early 7th century, long before the Great Schism, the split between the Greek Orthodox East and the Roman Catholic West, the Serbs were first Christinaized during the reign of Heraclius (610‚Äì641) but were fully Christianized by Eastern Orthodox Missionaries (Saints) Cyril and Methodius in 869 during Basil I, who sent them after Knez Mutimir, had acknowledged the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. After the Schism, those who lived under the Byzantine sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Roman sphere of influence became Catholic. Later, with the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, one part of Serbs converted to Islam. Their modern descendants are considered to be members of the Gorani and Bosniak ethnic groups. The White Angel, 1235 The Serbian Orthodox Church was the westernmost bastion of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Europe, which shaped its historical fate through contacts with Catholicism and Islam. During World War II, the Serbs, living in a wide area, were persecuted by various peoples and organizations. The Catholic Croats within the Independent State of Croatia recognized the Serbs only as \\"Croats of the Eastern Greek faith\\" and had the ideological vision that 1/3 of the Serbs were to be murdered, 1/3 were to be converted and the last third expelled. The outcome of these visions was the death of at least 700,000 people, the religious conversion of 250,000 and the expulsion of 250,000. =Names=Given names As with most Western cultures, a child is given a first name chosen by their parents but approved by the godparents of the child (the godparents usually approve the parent's choice). The given name comes first, the surname last, e.g. \\"≈Ωeljko Popoviƒá\\", where \\"≈Ωeljko\\" is a first name and \\"Popoviƒá\\" is a family name. Female names end with -a, e.g. Dragan -> Dragana. Popular names are mostly of Serbian (Slavic), Christian (Biblical), Greek and Latin origin. Some examples are: * Serbian: Dragana, Du≈°an, Milan, Milica, Milo≈°, Nemanja, Uro≈°, Vuk * Greek: Aleksandar, Anastasija, Anƒëela, ƒêorƒëe, Jelena, Katarina, Nikola, Stefan * Biblical: Ana, Lazar, Luka, Jovan or Ivan, Marija, Marko, Matija, Mihajlo, Pavle, Petar * Latin: Antonije, Roman, Srƒëan, Valentina Surnames Most Serbian surnames (like Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin) have the surname suffix -iƒá (pronounced , Cyrillic: -–∏—õ). This is often transliterated as -ic or -ici. In history, Serbian names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, -ich or -itch. This form is often associated with Serbs from before the early 20th century: hence Milutin Milankoviƒá is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch. The -iƒá suffix, with variants \\"-oviƒá\\"/\\"-eviƒá\\", is originally a Slavic diminutive and its meaning has been extended to creating patronymics. Thus the surname Petr(ov)iƒá signifies little Petar, as does, for example, \\"-sen\\"/\\"-son\\" in Scandinavian and to a lesser extent German and English names or a common prefix Mac (\\"son of\\") in Scottish & Irish, and O' (grandson of) in Irish names. It is estimated that some two thirds of all Serbian surnames end in -iƒá but that some 80% of Serbs carry such a surname with many common names being spread out among tens and even hundreds of non-related extended families. Other common surname suffixes are -ov or -in which is the Slavic possessive case suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. Those are more typical for Serbs from Vojvodina. The two suffixes are often combined. The most common surnames are Markoviƒá, Nikoliƒá, Petroviƒá, and Jovanoviƒá. Cuisine Most people in Serbia will have three meals daily, breakfast, lunch and dinner, with lunch being the largest and most important meal. However, traditionally, only lunch and dinner existed, with breakfast being introduced in the second half of the 19th century. burek) served with the national drink Rakia =Background= Traditional Serbian cuisine is varied and can be said to be a mix of European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. ƒÜevapi consisting of grilled heavily seasoned mixed ground meat patties is considered to be the national dish. Other notable dishes include Koljivo used in religious rituals, Serbian salad, Sarma (stuffed wineleaf), pilav (pilaf, Middle eastern meal similar to rizzoto), Moussaka and bean soup (prebranac). ƒåesnica is a traditional bread for Christmas Day. =Homemade meals= A number of foods which are simply bought into Supermarkets from the West, are often made at home in Serbia. These include rakija (fruit brandy), slatko, jam, jelly, and pickled foods (notably sauerkraut, ajvar and sausage). The reasons for this range from economical to cultural. Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition. =Desserts= Serbian desserts are a mixture of other Balkan desserts and desserts native to central Serbia. Desserts served are usually U≈°tipci, Tulumbe, Krofne and Palaƒçinke (crepes). Slatko is a traditional Serbian dessert popular throughout Serbia and it can be found in most Serbian restaurants in the Balkans and in the diaspora. =Drinks= Beer is widely consumed in Serbia. The most popular brands are Jelen Pivo and Lav Pivo. Rakija, a type of fruit brandy is also widespread, with the plum rakija (≈°ljivovica, symbol of ≈†umadija), and grape rakija (loza, southern Serbia). This is the national drink of Serbia and is common in other Mediterranean countries. Domestic wine is also popular. Turkish coffee (called domaƒáa or srpska kafa) is widely consumed as well. Language Serbian is the only European language with active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. On the picture: Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá's Serbian folk poems, 1841 Serbs speak the Serbian language, a member of the South Slavic group of languages, specifically in the Southwestern Slavic subgroup together with other Serbo-Croatian varieties and Slovenian. It is mutually intelligible with the Croatian and Bosnian language (see Differences in standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) and most linguists consider it one of the standard varieties of the common Serbo-Croatian language. The Serbian language comprises several dialects, the standard language is based on the Stokavian dialect. It is an official language in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Romania, it is a regionally recognized minority language. There are also historical variants of the Serbian language, namely Old Serbian and Slavonic-Serbian, a blend of Church Slavonic, Russian and Serbian. Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, a major dramatist, writer and the founder of several institutions of culture, such as the National Museum of Serbia Serbian is the only European language with active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles, the Cyrillic itself has its origins in Cyril and Methodius transformation from the Greek script. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian is Ljudevit Gaj's version shared by all Southwestern Slavic languages. Loanwords in the Serbian language are mostly from Turkish, German and Italian, words of Hungarian origin is present mostly in the north and Greek words mostly in the liturgy. Two Serbian words that are used in many of the world's languages are vampire and paprika. Slivovitz and ƒáevapƒçiƒái are Serbian words which have spread together with the Serbian food/drink they refer to. ≈†ljivovica is borrowed via German; paprika itself entered Serbian via Ottoman Turkish. Vampire entered most West European languages through German-language texts in the early 18th century and has since spread widely in the world. Literature Miroslav's Gospel is one of the earliest works of Serbian literature dating from between 1180 and 1191 and one of the most important works of the medieval period. This work was entered into UNESCO's Memory of the World program in 2005. Serbian epic poetry was a central part of medieval Serbian literature based on historic events such as the Battle of Kosovo. In the 20th century, Serbian literature flourished and a myriad of young and talented writers appeared. The most well known authors are Ivo Andriƒá, Milo≈° Crnjanski, Me≈°a Selimoviƒá, Borislav Pekiƒá, Danilo Ki≈°, Milorad Paviƒá, David Albahari, Miodrag Bulatoviƒá, Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá, Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá and many others. Jelena Dimitrijeviƒá and Isidora Sekuliƒá are two early 20th century women writers, while Svetlana Velmar-Jankoviƒá was the best known female novelist in mid 20th and early 21st century. Ivo Andriƒá won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. Miroslav's Gospel printed in 1186, UNESCO's Memory of the World Register Milorad Paviƒá is one of the most widely acclaimed Serbian authors, most notably for his Dictionary of the Khazars, which has been translated in 38 languages. Traditions and customs Serbs have many traditions. The Slava is exclusive custom of the Serbs, each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar, thus the Serbs celebrate Christmas on January 7, shared with the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists. * Slava, Serbian Orthodox Patron saint veneration * Kumstvo, God-parenthood in the Serbian Orthodox Church * Pobratimstvo, blood-brotherhood * Kolo, Serbian folk dance in circle. * Serbian Christmas traditions ** Badnjak (Serbian), Christmas tradition * Serbian epic poetry, Epic poetry * ƒåuvari Hristovog groba is a religious/cultural practice of guarding a representation of Christ's grave on Good Friday in the Church of St. Nicholas by the Serbian Orthodox inhabitants in the town of Vrlika The Serbs are a highly family-oriented society. A glance into a Serbian dictionary and the richness of their terminology related to kinship speaks volumes. Slava is a family feast prepared in honour of family's Patron Saint. It was inscribed in UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Of all Slavs and Orthodox Christians, only Serbs have the custom of slava. The Slava is the celebration of a family's patron saint; unlike most customs that are common for the whole people, each family separately celebrates its own saint (of course, there is a lot of overlap) who is considered its protector. A slava is inherited, mostly, though not exclusively from father to son (if a family has no son and a daughter stays in parental house and her husband moves in, her Slava, not his, is celebrated). Each household has only one saint it celebrates, which means that the occasion brings all of the family together. However, since many saints (e.g. St. Nicholas, St. John the Baptist, St. George, St. Archangels of Gabriel and Michael, and the Apostles St. Peter and Paul) have two feast days, both are marked. The traditional dance is a circle dance called kolo, which is common among Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians. It is a collective dance, where a group of people (usually several dozen, at the very least three) hold each other by the hands or around the waist dancing, forming a circle (hence the name), semicircle or spiral. It is called Oro in Montenegro. Similar circle dances also exist in other cultures of the region. Badnjak is a central tradition in Serbian Christmas celebrations Serbs have their own customs regarding Christmas. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar, so Christmas currently falls on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar. Early in the morning of Christmas Eve, the head of the family would go to a forest in order to cut badnjak, a young oak, the oak tree would then be brought into the church to be blessed by the priest. Then the oak tree would be stripped of its branches with combined with wheat and other grain products would be burned in the fireplace. The burning of the badnjak is a ritual which is most certainly of pagan origin and it is considered a sacrifice to God (or the old pagan gods) so that the coming year may bring plenty of food, happiness, love, luck and riches. Nowadays, with most Serbs living in towns, most simply go to their church service to be given a small parcel of oak, wheat and other branches tied together to be taken home and set afire. The house floor and church is covered with hay, reminding worshippers of the stable in which Jesus was born. Christmas Day itself is celebrated with a feast, necessarily featuring roasted piglet as the main meal. The most important Christmas meal is ƒçesnica, a special kind of bread. The bread contains a coin; during the lunch, the family breaks up the bread and the one who finds the coin is said to be assured of an especially happy year. Christmas is not associated with presents like in the West, although it is the day of Saint Nicholas, the protector saint of children, to whom presents are given. However, most Serbian families give presents on New Year's Day. Santa Claus (Deda Mraz (literally meaning Grandpa Frost)) and the Christmas tree (but rather associated with New Year's Day) are also used in Serbia as a result of globalisation. Serbs also celebrate the Old New Year (currently on January 14 of the Gregorian calendar). On Orthodox Easter, Serbs have the tradition of Slavic Egg decorating. Another related feature, often lamented by Serbs themselves, is disunity and discord; as Slobodan Naumoviƒá puts it, \\"Disunity and discord have acquired in the Serbian popular imaginary a notorious, quasi-demiurgic status. They are often perceived as being the chief malefactors in Serbian history, causing political or military defeats, and threatening to tear Serbian society completely apart.\\" That disunity is often quoted as the source of Serbian historic tragedies, from the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 to Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Even the contemporary notion of \\"two Serbia's\\"‚Äîone supposedly liberal, pro-European, Eurocentric and pro-western, and the other conservative, nationalist, Russophilic and Eurosceptic‚Äîseems to be the extension of the said discord. Popular proverbs \\"two Serbs, three political parties\\" and \\"God save us from Serbs that may unite!\\", and even the unofficial Serbian motto \\"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\\" (Samo sloga Srbina spasava) illustrate the national frustration with the inability to unite over important issues. Humour Serbian has a long tradition of humour and popular jokes. The most common type of humour is Black Humour and Serbian jokes are often imitated by other peoples from the Balkans, often with a twist. As with many other peoples, there are popular stereotypes on the local level: in popular jokes and stories, northern Serbs of Vojvodina (Lale) are perceived as phlegmatic, undisturbed and slow; Montenegrins are lazy and pushy; People from Pirot are misers; Bosnians are raw and simple; Serbs from Central Serbia (≈†umadija) are often portrayed as capricious and malicious, etc. Also, policemen and blondes are mocked as being stupid. Visual arts Migration of the Serbs (1896) by Paja Jovanoviƒá depicts the Great Serb Migrations, on display in the National Museum of Serbia. There was some resumption of artistic endeavour after the restoration of the Serbian patriarch in 1557. Djordje Mitrofanoviƒá was the leading painter of the early 17th century with his work on the church at the Moraƒça Monastery considered as amongst his best. ≈†id under Snow (1935) by Sava ≈†umanoviƒá A Baroque church 'Our Lady of the Rocks' on an island in the Boka Kotorska, in Montenegro is one of the most notable pieces of architecture in the Serbian lands from the early modern period. There are many fine specimens of silverware dating from the 17th century there. Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of Nikola Ne≈°koviƒá, Teodor Kraƒçun and Jakov Orfelin. There was somewhat of a resurgence in Serbian art in the 19th century as Serbia gradually regained its autonomy. Prince Aleksandar commissioned the building of a Monument to the Insurgents in Karaƒëorƒëev Park in 1848 in Vraƒçar. Serbian paintings showed the influence of Neoclassicism and Romanticism during the 19th century. Anastas Jovanoviƒá was a pioneering photographer in Serbia taking the photos of many leading citizens. Kirilo Kutlik set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. Nade≈æda Petroviƒá was influenced by Fauvism while Sava ≈†umanoviƒá worked in Cubism. After World War I, the Belgrade School of Painting developed in the capital with some members such as Milan Konjoviƒá working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as Marko ƒåelebonoviƒá working in a style called Intimisme based on the use of colours. The most famous Serbian painters were Paja Jovanoviƒá and Uro≈° Prediƒá, painting in the Realist style. Their monumental paintings of historical events have inspired generations of Serbian artists. Performing arts=Music= Marija ≈†erifoviƒá won the Eurovision Contest for Serbia in 2007. Serbian music dates from the medieval period with strong church and folk traditions. Church music in Serbia of the time was based on the Osmoglasnik a cycle of religious songs based on the resurrection and lasting for eight weeks. During the Nemanjiƒá dynasty and under other rulers such as Stefan Du≈°an, musicians enjoyed royal patronage. There was a strong folk tradition in Serbia dating from this time. Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac During Ottoman rule, Serbs were forbidden to own property, to learn to read and write and denied the use of musical instruments. Church music had to be performed in private. Gusle, a one-stringed instrument, was used by Serbian peasants during this time in an effort to find a loophole through the stringent Ottoman laws. Filip Vi≈°njiƒá was a particularly notable guslar (gusle player). In the 18th century, Russian and Greek chant schools were established and the Serbian Orthodox Church accepted Church Slavonic into their liturgy. Folk music enjoyed a resurgence in the nineteenth century. Stevan Mokranjac, a composer and musicologist collected folk songs as well as performing his own work. Kornelije Stankoviƒá wrote the first Serbian language works for choirs. Traditional Serbian folk music remains popular today especially in rural areas. Western rock and pop music has become increasingly popular especially in cities with rock acts such as Riblja ƒåorba and ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá incorporating political statements in their music. Turbo-folk combined Western rock and pop styles with traditional folk music vocals. Serbian immigrants have taken their musical traditions to nations such as the US and Canada. Marija ≈†erifoviƒá won first place at the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest, and Serbia was the host of the 2008 contest. Several notable composers used motifs from Serbian folk music and composed works inspired by Serbian history or culture, such as: Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Arthur Rubinstein, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Schubert, Hans Huber and other. =Theatre and cinema= A still from The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Leader Karaƒëorƒëe, the first feature film released in the Balkans. Serbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The Serbian National Theatre was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company. Bitef, Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia. Cinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 feature films being produced before the start of World War II. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939. The National Theatre in Belgrade, founded in 1869 Cinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was Du≈°an Makavejev who was internationally recognised for Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's Montenegro was made in Sweden in 1981. Zoran Radmiloviƒá was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period. Serbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. Emir Kusturica won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the Cannes Film Festival, for When Father Was Away on Business in 1985 and then again for Underground in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing Black Cat, White Cat. Serbian handcrafts Serbia has a long tradition of handicrafts. ƒêakovica in Kosovo was known for its black pottery. Pirot in southern Serbia became known for its ceramics under the Ottomans with the potters following Byzantine designs. It also became a centre for the production of Kilims or rugs. The Slavs introduced jewellery making to Serbia in the sixth century AD. Metalworking started to develop on a significant scale following the development of a Serbian state. Workshops were set up in towns, large estates and in monasteries. The Studenica Monastery was known for the quality of its goldsmithing. Coins were minted not only by the kings but some of the wealthier nobility. The nobility also was influenced by the wealth of the Byzantine court. Metalworking like many other arts and crafts went into decline following the Ottoman conquest. However, there was a partial revival in later centuries with a strong Baroque influence notably the 17th century silverware at \\"Our Lady on the Rocks\\" on Boka Kotorska. Media As of 2001, there were 27 daily newspapers and 580 other newspapers published in Serbia. Some of these newspapers have Internet editions. Politika founded in 1904 is the oldest daily newspaper in the Balkans. There were also 491 periodical magazines published in Serbia with the Nedeljne informativne novine (NIN) and Vreme amongst the most notable. Television broadcasting started in 1958 with every country in the former Yugoslavia having its own station. In Serbia, the state television station was known as RTB and became known as RTS (Radio Television of Serbia) after the breakup of Yugoslavia. From the time of Yugoslavia until the Bulldozer Revolution in 2000, state broadcasting was controlled by the ruling party. The RTS station was bombed during NATO's 1999 air-strikes against Yugoslavia, as they claimed this was being used for propaganda. There was some private broadcasting with the B92 radio and television station starting in 1989 although it was shut down in 1999 during the hostilities. After the fall of Milo≈°eviƒá, RTS became known as \\"new\\" RTS as an assertion of independence while B92 commenced broadcasting. During 2001, there were 70 television centres in Serbia of which 24 were privately owned. In 2003, there was a return to censorship as the Government of Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá temporarily imposed a state of emergency following the assassination of Zoran Djindjic and the European Federation of Journalists continues to hold concerns over media freedom in the country. Sport Novak Djokovic Long jumper Ivana ≈†panoviƒá, World and European champion Serbia is very successful in many sports. Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, water polo, sport shooting, handball, volleyball and tennis. The two most popular football clubs in Serbia are Red Star Belgrade and FK Partizan. Their supporters are the Delije and the Grobari, respectively. The Serbian national football team participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In basketball, Serbian clubs are successful and participate regularly in European competitions, where they often make quarter-final and semi-final appearances. The Serbian national basketball team is successful in international competitions, having won several FIBA World Championship, EuroBasket and Olympic gold medals. Serbian men's and women's teams are also World Champions in sports such as water polo and volleyball. Serbian tennis players have been successful. Novak Djokovic is the current World No. 2 and he has won sixteen Grand Slam Singles titles so far. Janko Tipsareviƒá, Viktor Troicki, Jelena Jankoviƒá and Ana Ivanovic are also successful. The Serbia Davis Cup team won the 2010 Davis Cup Final held in the Belgrade Arena. Cultural institutions Matica srpska based in Novi Sad, the oldest matica in the world. At the beginning of the 21st century, there were 32 art galleries and 142 museums in Serbia. Belgrade has many of the most significant with the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade, the Gallery of Frescoes featuring Orthodox Church art, the Ethnographic Museum and the Princess Ljubica's Residence. Novi Sad contains the Museum of Vojvodina, Gallery of Matica Srpska as well as the Petrovaradin fortress. Matica Srpska is the oldest and most notable cultural and scientific organisation in today's Serbia. Its name is translated in Serbian as the Serbian matrix or parent body of the Serbs. It was founded in 1826 in Budapest and moved to Novi Sad in 1864. Amongst other achievements, it compiled a six-volume study of the Serbian language between 1967 and 1976. Its journal Letopis Matice Srpske is one of the oldest periodicals examining scientific and cultural issues anywhere in the world. Vojvodina province of Austro-Hungary became attractive for Serbs ever since the fall of Serbia in the 15th century, and was the site of the Great Serbian Migrations, when Serbs colonized the area escaping Turkish vengeance. Sremski Karlovci became the spiritual, political and cultural centre of the Serbs in the Habsburg Empire, with Metropolitan of the Serbian Orthodox Church residing in the town. To this day, Serbian Patriarch retains the title of Metropolitan of (Sremski) Karlovci. The town featured the earliest Serb and Slavic grammar school (Serbian: gimnazija/–≥–∏–º–Ω–∞–∑–∏—ò–∞, French: Lyc√©e) founded on August 3, 1791. In 1794, an Orthodox seminary was also founded in the town, ranking second oldest in the world (after the Spiritual Academy in Kiev). Novi Sad is home to Serbia's oldest professional theatre, founded in 1861 as Serbian National Theatre (serbian: Srpsko Narodno Pozori≈°te), followed by Belgrade in 1868; however two other cities claim this title: City of Kragujevac Knjazesko Srbski Teatar since 1835 and Subotica since 1851 (*there were theatres throughout Serbia long before that time but cannot be classified as \\"professional\\"). There is a network of libraries with three national libraries, 689 public libraries, 143 higher education libraries and 11 non-specialised libraries as at 1998. The National Library of Serbia is the most significant of these. Project Rastko founded in 1997 is an Internet library of Serb culture. Roots to the Serbian education system date back to 11th and 12th centuries when first Catholic colleges were founded in Vojvodina (Titel, Bac). Medieval Serbian education however was mostly conducted through the Serbian Orthodox monasteries (UNESCO protected Sopoƒáani, Studenica, Patriarchate of Peƒá) starting from the rise of Ra≈°ka in the 12th century, when Serbs overwhelmingly embraced Eastern Orthodoxy rather than Roman Catholicism. The first European-style higher education facilities however were founded in Catholic Vojvodina, Teacher's College in Subotica in 1689, although several facilities have functioned even before (e.g. Jesuit School in Belgrade, since 1609). Following short-lived Serbian independence between 1804 and 1813, Belgrade officially became an educational centre of the country (excluding Vojvodina). The University of Belgrade is the biggest and most prestigious institution of higher education in Serbia, founded as the Belgrade Higher School in 1808. The Gymnasium Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj was founded in 1810 and many important Serb cultural figures studied there. Within the Government of Serbia, the Serbian Ministry for Culture is responsible for administering its cultural facilities. National symbols Serbian tetragrammatic cross. The Serbian state Flag *The Serbian flag is a red-blue-white horizontal tricolour. *The Serbian eagle, a white two-headed eagle, which represents dual power and sovereignty (monarch and church), was the coat of arms of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. *The Serbian cross is based on the Byzantine cross, but where the Byzantine Cross held 4 Greek letter 'V' (or 'B') meaning King of Kings, ruling over Kings, the Serbian cross turned the Byzantine \\"B\\" into 4 Cyrillic letters of 'S' (C) with little stylistic modification, for a whole new message (traditionally rendered as Samo sloga Srbina spasava ‚Äì Only Unity Saves the Serbs). If displayed on a field, traditionally it is on red field, but could be used with no field at all. Both the eagle and the cross, besides being the basis for various Serbian coats of arms through history, are bases for the symbols of various Serbian organizations, political parties, institutions and companies. Serbian folk attire varies, mostly because of the very diverse geography and climate of the territory inhabited by the Serbs. Some parts of it are, however, common: *A traditional shoe that is called the opanak. It is recognizable by its distinctive tips that spiral backward. Each region of Serbia has a different kind of tips. *A traditional hat that is called the ≈†ajkaƒça. It is easily recognizable by its top part that looks like the letter V or like the bottom of a boat (viewed from above), after which it got its name. It gained wide popularity in the early 20th century as it was the hat of the Serbian army in the First World War. It is still worn everyday by some villagers today, and it was a common item of headgear among Bosnian Serb military commanders during the Bosnian War in the 1990s. However, the \\"≈†ajkaƒça\\" is common mostly for the Serbian population living in the region of Central Serbia (≈†umadija), while Serbs living in Vojvodina, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia had different types of traditional hats, which are not similar to \\"≈°ajkaƒça\\". Different types of traditional hats could be also found in eastern and southern parts of Central Serbia.

She succeeded Queen Zabibe (Arabic meaning \\"Raisin\\"). Tiglath-Pileser III (Pileser (Babylonian (Pulu) son of Ashur-nirari V), the king of Assyria, was the first foreign ruler to bring the Arabs under his control. When Samsi rebelled against him by joining an alliance forged by Rakhianu of Damascus, Pileser attacked and defeated Samsi, made her and her alliance partners surrender, and pay a tribute to remain in power. She ruled for 20 years and her successor was Queen Iatie, in about 700 BC. History The Assyrian chronicles describe Queen Samsi as a powerful ruler who was bold enough to face the Assyrian kings in the 730s and 720s. She and others are mentioned as rulers of the regions far to the west of Assyria who were aware of the Assyrian kings and had trade with them in spices Samsi and her predecessor and successor queens had led embassies and caravans carrying spices and incense to the Near East and Syria from the Arabian Peninsula. Tiglath-Pileser III Samsi had come to power as a vassal of Assyria, succeeding the former Arabian queen Zabibe, who had abdicated in Samsi's favour. Zabibe's oath of allegiance was continued by Samsi on taking the throne; she swore by the sun, the god of Arabia, that she would be loyal to Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser gave formal recognition to this accession. Later, however, she changed her mind and rebelled, joining an alliance made by Rakhianu of Damascus to fight the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 732 BCE. The Assyrian army under King Tiglath-Pileser III (ruled 745‚Äì727 BCE) had recently subjugated the land of Edom and now turned its attention to the anti- Assyrian forces in Arabia and the Levant. According to the Assyrian records, Tiglath-Pileser attacked many Arab tribal areas and defeated Samsi in the neighborhood of Mount Sa-qu-ur-ri (a place not identified). The Assyrians took many prisoners of war, 30,000 camels, and more than 20,000 oxen as booty. An inscription records that 9,400 of her soldiers were killed, and in addition 5,000 bags of various types of spices, altars of gods, armaments including an ornamental staff of her goddess, and her estates were seized. As she fled to the desert, Tiglath-Pileser set fire to the remaining tents at the battle site. After her defeat, Samsi was said by the Assyrian chroniclers to have fled the battlefield like a \\"wild she-ass of the desert\\". She did not remain at liberty for long, as she was soon captured and brought as prisoner to Tiglath-Pileser. He appointed a qepu or governor over her and 10,000 soldiers, and restored her to her kingdom. It is also said that she had escaped to the land of Bazu/Basu and later surrendered. The terms of surrender to Tiglath- Pileser involved a tribute to be paid by Samsi. The Assyrians chose to restore her as they needed a pliable Arab ruler in order to maintain the lucrative north-south trade route from Assyrian territory across Arabia. Seven other kingdoms involved in Arabian commerce were also required to pay tribute and provide security to their incense trade; these seven kingdoms were Massa, Tyma, Saba, Haiappa (Ephah), Badana, Hattia, and Idibi'lu. The tribute agreed to be paid by the Arabs included gold, silver, male and female camels, and all types of spices.

White lions in the area of Timbavati were thought to have been indigenous to the Timbavati region of South Africa for centuries, although the earliest recorded sighting in this region was in 1938. Regarded as divine by some African cultures, white lions first became known to the English-speaking world in the 1977 through the book The White Lions of Timbavati. Description White lions are not albinos. Their white color is caused by a recessive trait derived from a less-severe mutation in the same gene that causes albinism, distinct from the gene responsible for white tigers. They vary from blonde to near-white. This coloration does not appear to pose a disadvantage to their survival. The white lions have been reintroduced into their natural habitat and have been hunting and breeding successfully without human intervention for a significant amount of time. Breeding and genetics A recessive gene gives white lions their unusual colors. A similar gene also produces white tigers. White lions can therefore be selectively bred for zoos, animal shows and wildlife parks. Such breeding involves inbreeding and can result in inbreeding depression (genetic defects, reduced fertility, and physical defects), although this has not yet been found to cause hind-limb paralysis or serious heart defects, which would indicate a severe level of inbreeding. Some are concerned about white lions mating with lions of other alleles, due to possible extinction of the white lion allele. However, this is not valid as the offspring will inherit the recessive white gene and therefore make it possible to produce white offspring in a later generation, thus making the allele more widespread. Some critics maintain that white lions should not be introduced into the wild because of the inbreeding that has taken place in zoos and breeding camps. However, ethical reintroduction programs such as The Global White Lion Protection Trust have ensured through the use of scientific methodologies that the lions in their program are not inbred. =White lions of unknown ancestry= * A white lion breeding program is currently underway at Inkwenkwezi Private Game Reserve in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. * Four white lion cubs were born at the Papanack Park Zoo outside Ottawa. They have since been released into the main reserve with the other tawny lions. * In March 2017, an attempt to smuggle white lions from Afghanistan to Pakistan was quashed. The origin of the lions was unclear at first,Pajhwok 2017. Bid to smuggle 6 white lions to Pakistan frustrated. Pajwhwok Afghan News before Border Police Commander-General Ne'matullah Haidari said that they were African.

Border Police Seize Six Lions At Spin Boldak Crossing Tolonews Lory Park Zoo Lory Park Zoo is currently in possession of two adult white lions (Daniel and Heidi), who have produced eight cubs. A litter of three cubs was born in 2012 and all three were hand-reared. A second litter of five cubs was born in 2013; three were removed for their own well-being while the remaining two (a male, Gabriel, and a female, Gazelle) were left with the parents. Both cubs are still with the parents and have not been handled by humans. A male cub was traded for other animals in August 2013 and now lives at the Hodonin Zoo in the Czech Republic. Kruger and Umfolozi In 1979, three litters containing white lions were recorded in Kruger National Park. In March, a female lion with three white cubs was observed near Tshokwane. In September, three white cubs (from two different lionesses) were seen. Another litter of white female cubs was captured from Kruger National Park and treated for sarcoptic mange. A white lion was observed in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in Zululand. Rustenburg Wildlife Rehabilitation Center In 2018, Mufasa, a three-year-old, was in the process of being sold in South Africa after he was taken from an owner illegally keeping him as a pet. An anonymous buyer wanted both Mufasa and a female lion named Soraya, intending to protect both. Over 280,000 signed a petition asking that Mufasa not be auctioned, fearing a buyer might just want the lion for hunting. =Eurasia= The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria opposes the deliberate breeding of white lions. West Midland Safari Park In 2004, four white lions arrived at West Midland Safari Park, the only white lions in the United Kingdom. Roland (or Rowland), the male, and three lionesses (Marin, Natasha, and JoAnn; spellings undocumented) settled into the Kingdom of the White Lion exhibit at the park very well. In 2008 one lioness had four cubs in the space of nine hours, doubling the total to eight in England. The pride at the Park in Worcestershire is the only pride of white lion in the UK. Newspapers and bloggers reported that the four cubs born at West Midlands Safari Park, in 2008 (names: Caspar, Kiara, Lara and Toto; spellings undocumented) had been sold to perform in a Japanese circus. It is alleged that the lions were given to British businessman Jim Clubb, who runs Amazing Animals, which also goes by the name Heythrop Zoological Gardens, in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

Genetics Genetically, the white lion is the same subspecies as the tawny South African lion (Panthera leo melanochaita), which is found in some wildlife reserves in South Africa, and in zoological parks around the world. White lions are not albinos, but leucistic. They have pigment visible in the eyes (which may be the normal hazel or golden color, blue-gray, or green-gray), paw pads and lips. Blue-eyed white lions exist and may be selectively bred. The leucistic trait is due to a recessive mutation in the gene for Tyrosinase (TYR), an enzyme responsible for the production of melanins.Yun Sung Cho et al. (2013). \\"The tiger genome and comparative analysis with lion and snow leopard genomes\\", Nature Communications 4: 2433, More severe mutations in the same gene have been found to cause albinism in many species, while another less severe mutation in the same gene is responsible for the Chinchilla coloring trait seen in several mammals. Reduced pigment production decreases the deposition of pigment along the hair shaft, restricting it to the tips. The less pigment there is along the hair shaft, the paler the lion. As a result, \\"white\\" lions range from blonde to near- white. The males have pale manes and tail tips instead of the usual dark tawny or black. In the wild within their natural endemic range From the 1970s onwards, prized for their rarity, the white lions and many 'normal' coloured (tawny) lions carrying the white lion gene were removed from the wild and put into captive breeding and hunting programs and sent to zoos and circuses around the globe. No adult white lion had been seen in their natural habitat since 1994. The Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) therefore initiated a world-first re-establishment of white lions within their natural habitat in 2004, based on successful reintroduction techniques. The wild born offspring of rehabilitated white lions were integrated with resident wild tawny lions, and released through a soft release process. Three prides of white lions of high genetic integrity integrated with tawny lions have been successfully established, and are hunting self-sufficiently in their natural habitat, at a predation rate comparable to the wild tawny lions in the same habitat.Turner, J. A., Vasicek, C. A., & Somers, M. J. (2015). Effects of a colour variant on hunting ability: the white lion in South Africa. Open Science Repository Biology, Online(open-access), e45011830. doi:10.7392/openaccess.45011830Valeix, M. (2015). Review of \\"Effects of a colour variant on hunting ability - the white lions in South Africa\\": http://www.open-science-repository.com/review-of-the-article-effects-of-a- colour-variant-on-hunting-ability-the-white-lion-in-south-africa.html The genetic marker determining the white colouration was identified in a collaborative study with 5 other countries in October 2013, and is being used to ensure genetic integrity and ultimately to determine the frequency of occurrence of the gene in the wild population. The primary aim of the Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) is to harness the cultural importance of white lions to local indigenous communities,Tucker, Linda \\"Mystery of the White Lions - Children of the Sun God\\" 2003 Npenvu Press. to help protect the Kruger to Canyon (K2C) Biosphere and the greater lion population in this region. This approach is based on the international precedent of the Kermode Bear (Ursus americanus kermodei) in British Columbia, whereby this rare, white variant of the American black bear (Ursus americanus) has been declared a critically endangered subspecies due to its conservation and cultural value, such that the Kermode Bear is being used as a flagship species for protecting a 4000 000 ha wilderness area.Marshall, H. D. & K. Ritland. (2002). Genetic diversity and differentiation of Kermode bear populations. Molecular Ecology, 11: 685-697 As with the Kermode Bear, by protecting the white lions, their entire population within their endemic area would be protected. Subsequently, white cubs were born in the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and in the Nwanetsi Area of Kruger National Park in 2014 and 2015, confirming that white lions are a natural occurrence and the recessive gene is still present in the wild population. In light of the recent decision by South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) at CITES 2016, to continue to allow the hunting of captive bred lions (\\"canned hunting\\"), and the trade in lion bones from captive bred lions, the Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) asserts that the survival of lions in the Greater Kruger Park Region is likely to come under threat, and the white lion is the ideal capstone animal to help better protect all lions in the Greater Kruger Park Region. As the proposed policy stands for the management of lions in South Africa,Funston, P.J., M. Levendal, & Department of Environmental Affairs. (2014). Draft Biodiversity Management Plan for the lion (Panthera leo) in South Africa. https://www.environment.gov.za/sites/default/files/gazetted_notices/nemba_africanlion_managementplan_gn351g38706.pdf the WLT asserts that the legalization of the lion bone trade will increase the supply and therefore demand of wild lion trophies and especially lion bones, increasing poaching and illegal hunting and threatening the future of wild lion populations in South Africa.

The Australian brushturkey has also been introduced to Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It is the largest extant representative of the family Megapodiidae, and is one of three species to inhabit Australia. Despite its name and their superficial similarities, the bird is not closely related to American turkeys, nor to the Australian bustard, which is also known as the bush turkey. Its closest relatives are the wattled brushturkey, Waigeo brushturkey, and malleefowl. Biology It is a large bird with black feathers and a red head. Its total length is about and a wingspan of about . The subspecies A. l. purpureicollis from the northern Cape York Peninsula is smaller than the more widespread nominate subspecies. It has a prominent, fan- like tail flattened sideways, and its plumage is mainly blackish, but with a bare red head, and a yellow (in the nominate subspecies) or purple wattle (in A. l. purpureicollis). The males' wattles become much larger during breeding season, often swinging from side to side as they run. The males' heads and wattles also become much brighter during the breeding and nesting season. The underside of the body is sprinkled with white feathers, more pronounced in older birds. The brushturkey is a clumsy flyer and cannot fly long distances, only taking to the air when threatened by predators or to roost in trees at night and during the heat of the day. Leaf litter nest of an Australian brushturkey in northern Sydney. They build large nests on the ground made of leaves, other compostable material, and earth, high and up to across. Mound- building is done by a dominant male, and visited by a succession of local females, for mating and egg-laying. The male works tirelessly, collecting material from all around, and also diligently repelling rival males, which are keen to usurp his position. The effort involved eventually wears him down, and he will ultimately be defeated by a new king. The eggs are very large (90 √ó 45 mm), and the young are fully fledged on hatching. They can fly within hours, as soon as the feathers are dry. The eggs are hatched by the heat of the composting mound, the temperature of which is regulated by adding or removing material to maintain the temperature in the incubation temperature range. The Australian brushturkey checks the temperature by sticking its beak into the mound. Like some reptiles, incubation temperature affects the sex ratio of chicks, but the mechanism is different between reptiles and these birds, with reptiles exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination, and megapodes exhibiting temperature-dependent embryo mortality. The sex ratio in brushturkeys is equal at incubation temperatures of 34¬∞C, but results in more males when cooler and more females when warmer (p=0.035). Whether the parents use this to manipulate the sex of their offspring by, for instance, selecting the nesting site accordingly, is unclear. Warmer incubation also results in heavier, fitter chicks (p<0.0001), but how this is linked to gender is also unknown. The same nesting site is frequently used year after year, with the old nests being added to each breeding season. The average clutch of eggs is between 16 and 24 large white eggs, which are laid September to March. Sometimes, up to 50 eggs laid by several females may be found in a single mound. The eggs are placed in a circle roughly down, apart, always with the large end up. The newly hatched young dig themselves out of the mound and then have to care for themselves. Brushturkey eggs are a favourite food of goannas, snakes, and dingoes and dogs, though brushturkeys were also a staple of Aboriginal Australians. Often, goannas exhibit wounds on their tails from having been pecked by brushturkeys that ferociously chase them away from their nests. In situations where they come into contact with humans, such as picnic areas in national parks and suburban gardens, brushturkeys exhibit little fear and often boldly attempt to steal food from tables and raid compost bins. They nest in suburban gardens, and in search of material for their nests remove enormous amounts of mulch from gardens. Habitat The Australian brushturkey inhabits rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests, but can also be found in drier scrubs and open areas. In the northern part of its range, the Australian brushturkey is most common at higher altitudes, but individuals move to the lowland areas in winter. In the south, it is common in both mountain and lowland regions. Brushturkeys are now common in urban environments and can be found in backyards in both Brisbane and Sydney. Population Brushturkeys are fairly common presently, but in the 1930s, the bird was supposed to be approaching extinction. Feeding Brushturkeys feed upon insects, seeds, and fallen fruits, which are exposed by raking the leaf litter or breaking open rotten logs with their large feet. The majority of food is obtained from the ground, with birds occasionally observed feeding on ripening fruits among tree branches. Human interaction Male brushturkey on tiles, Cooktown, Queensland The Australian brushturkey can damage gardens when raking up the ground looking for food. It can also cause extensive damage to food crops. The Department of Environment, Climate Change, and Water provides hints for living with brushturkeys in urban environments. They are sometimes hunted for food, including as part of the diet by traditional Aboriginal Australians. Their eggs, which weigh on average , are also sometimes eaten. The Australian brush- turkey is fully protected in Queensland. Under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 it is an offence to harm brush turkeys.https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2017-07-03/act-1992-020 For a class 1 offence it is 3000 penalty units or two years imprisonment. For a class 4 offence it is 100 penalty units or $13,345.00 Au.http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/nca1992237/s88.html In New South Wales, shooting a brush turkey has resulted in fines of up to $22,000 under the Biodiversity Conservation Act.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-08/brush-turkey-arrow-attack-in-the- suburbs/10467510 References *Edden, R. and Boles, W.E. 1986.

She was awarded the FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and Woman International Master (WIM) in 1950, and Woman Grandmaster (WGM) in 1976. She was the first woman awarded the International Master title. Rudenko was also USSR women's champion in 1952.  Early life and swimming career  Rudenko was born in 1904 in Lubny, in the Poltava region of what is now Ukraine. At age 10, Rudenko was taught how to play chess by her father‚Äîalthough, at first, she was more interested in swimming. After secondary school, she moved to Odessa and took a degree in economics. Rudenko became the swimming champion of Odessa in the breaststroke. In 1925, she was swimming vice-champion of Ukraine (breaststroke). She started a career as an economic planner for the Soviet Union, and chess became a hobby. Chess career Rudenko began playing tournament chess in 1925 after a move to Moscow. In 1928, she won the Moscow women's championship. She then moved to Leningrad, where she met and married scientist Lev Davidovich Goldstein; in 1931 they had a son. In Leningrad in 1929 she began training with chess master Peter Romanovsky. She won the Leningrad women's championship three times. In World War II, Rudenko organized a train to evacuate children from the Siege of Leningrad. She described this as the most important accomplishment in her life. Women's World Champion Vera Menchik died in 1944 during an air raid. After the war, in the winter of 1949-1950, the World Chess Federation FIDE held a tournament in Moscow to determine the new women's champion. Sixteen women from twelve countries competed, with the four Soviet players taking the top four spots. At the time Rudenko was roughly 40 years old, and she won (scoring nine wins, one loss, and five draws). She held the Women's World Championship title until losing it to Elisaveta Bykova in 1953 in the next championship cycle. Her score was 6‚Äì8 (five wins, seven losses, and two draws). Rudenko's post-war chess trainers were Alexander Tolush and Grigory Levenfish.  Legacy  Rudenko was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame in 2015. She was honored with a Google Doodle on the 114th anniversary of her birth, 27 July 2018. ReferencesExternal links * *E. Bishard about L.

The first European to explore the district was Thomas Burr in September 1842. His promising reports soon led to occupation of the district by pastoralists, one of whom was Herbert Bristow Hughes (c. 1821 ‚Äì 18 May 1892). When the present town was surveyed he named it for his wife, Laura n√©e White (c. 1829 ‚Äì 5 January 1909). Laura is administered by the Northern Areas Council, and is in the state electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey. It was formerly the council seat of the Corporate Town of Laura (1882-1932) and the District Council of Laura (1932-1988), as well as the District Council of Booyoolie (1876-1932), which covered the area surrounding the township. The Laura Community Development and Tourism Association Incorporated liaises with the Northern Areas Council in preserving the amenity of the rural centre, with the support of many volunteers in community projects. The LCDTA's major project is operating the community-owned Laura Caravan Park. Profits from the caravan park operations are then used for improvements in the township. The Spiny Daisy (Acanthocladium dockeri) was rediscovered in 1999 near Laura. The species, which was last seen in the South Australian Riverland in 1910, was found along a roadside.  Attractions = Current = The Laura Folk Fair is a two-day event held in April every year. There is no admission fee which makes the Folk Fair a family friendly outing. The Laura Country Music Festival has been held annually in July since 2011. Laura is famous as the home of Golden North ice cream which has been manufactured in the town since 1923 (the factory being the biggest employer in the district), and was a boyhood home of poet C. J. Dennis, whose first poem was published in the Laura Standard newspaper. = Former = The Wilmington railway line was built from Gladstone railway station to Laura in 1884. It was extended from Laura in 1910 to Booleroo Centre, and finally to Wilmington in 1915. It closed in 1969. The historic former Laura Courthouse in Hughes Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Media Between 1889 and 1948, Laura had its own newspaper, the Standard. Its first iteration, Laura Standard (subtitled: and Beetaloo, Wirrabara, Melrose, Booleroo Centre and Yarrowie Advertiser) ran from 1889. In 1917 it merged with Crystal Brook Times to form Laura Standard and Crystal Brook Courier.

The school was opened in 1956, to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding North Brisbane population whose children were members of the post-World War II baby boomer generation. Kedron is a co-educational and non-denominational school, renowned in Brisbane for offering a Special Education Unit for hearing- impaired students and also for its accredited International Students Program. In 2007 the school joined the Healthy State system and removed a large proportion of junk food including all soft drinks.  History  Kedron State High School is situated on 134 000 m¬≤ of land bordering Kedron Brook and Kedron Park. Originally inhabited by the Aboriginal Enoggera tribe, the site was also owned by Queensland's first Resident Judge, Alfred Lutwyche. From the 1880s onward it was used as a racecourse which was later partially owned by businessman John Wren in 1912. Kedron was established in 1956; the school derives its name from a valley mentioned in the Bible and located in Palestine. Over the years, enrolment has ranged from 274 students in 1956 to 1700 in 1976. Since its inception, almost 20 000 students have attended Kedron. A language census conducted in 2003 revealed 38 languages were spoken within the school community. Halfway through each year, Kedron celebrates a week called 'Kedron Week' where for one week everyday, assemblies and activities are held to celebrate the many different activities the school holds. Also because the school is highly multi-cultural students from foreign countries greet the school on assembles in their own national language. Music, dancing, races, games and stories are usually put to show. In 2006, Kedron celebrated their 50th anniversary.  Student achievements  Kedron is a traditional school which focusses primarily on scholastic excellence. Its students have achieved High Distinctions, Distinctions and Credits in Australasian Schools Competitions run by the University of New South Wales in English, Computer Science & Literacy, Science and Writing, and various other competitions. There have also been pupils selected to attend the National Youth Science Forum in Canberra and national winners in the National History Challenge. There is also a strong focus on school-leavers' performance in statewide academic rankings; Kedron's Queensland Core Skills Test (QCS) preparation program has proven highly effective with 8 students in 2009 achieving an Overall Position (OP) of 1, the highest possible rank in the state. Kedron also has a very strong focus on the arts. The music program in Kedron is very high achieving. In 1975, a Kedron band travelled to Longreach to play at the opening of the Stockman's Hall of Fame. They were followed 30 years later by a new generation of Kedron musicians to play at an anniversary celebration of the Hall's opening. As of 2007, a Kedron student has become the third in three years to win the coveted Pierre de Coubertin Award for sporting excellence, an initiative of the Australian Olympic Committee.

Alex Sichel received a grant from the Princess Grace Foundation to make a film about the riot grrrl music scene and then asked her sister to collaborate with her. The soundtrack featured musicians and bands such as Ani DiFranco, Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland and many more. Plot This film focuses on Claude (Alison Folland), a teenage girl who lives in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, and is the story of her sexual discovery and budding lesbianism during summer vacation. Claude's best friend is Ellen (Tara Subkoff). Her plan to start a band with Ellen is subverted when Ellen begins dating Mark (Cole Hauser). Claude discovers that Luke (Pat Briggs), a gay musician who has just moved into her apartment building, has been stabbed to death in what might have been a hate crime. Ellen hints at the fact that she was there when Luke was killed, but Claude keeps her mouth shut in order to protect her. Claude then goes to a gay bar and meets Lucy (Leisha Hailey), a pink-haired guitarist who is playing in the house band. Claude goes to Lucy's apartment, but freaks out and leaves, returning to her apartment to find Ellen waiting for her. They have a fight which ends with Claude screaming that she would die without Ellen. Claude goes out along with Ellen and Mark on one of their dates; Mark gives Ellen downers which make her violently ill. Claude brings her to the bathroom and forces her to vomit, and Ellen refers to Claude as her \\"Knight in Shining Armor.\\" Mark is visibly furious but manages to contain himself. Claude leaves and goes to Lucy's apartment again, but leaves after a brief make-out session. On the way home, Claude is ambushed in the street by Mark, who questions her relationship with Ellen. Claude threatens to tell the police about Mark's possible involvement in Luke's death due in large part that she is worried that he is leading Ellen down a dark path. Claude goes home to find Ellen waiting for her. Claude tells her that they need to tell the police about Mark, but Ellen says she would go to jail if they knew about her involvement. Claude says she would never let that happen. Claude kisses Ellen and tells her that she loves her. Ellen tells Claude not to say that, and Claude leaves. The next day, Claude cleans out her room, removing all traces of Ellen. She goes to the police before work. Later, the police comes into her workplace and takes Mark away for questioning. Ellen tells Claude that she hates her. Claude says that she knows, and that she's sorry. Claude then starts seeing Lucy.

Reception=Critical= Critical response to All Over Me was generally positive. Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 86% approval rating based on 28 reviews, with an average score of 7.26/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"All Over Me takes a serious, sensitive approach to teen lives and romantic relationships that are all too often ignored or misunderstood\\". Critics were impressed with this directorial debut and described it as powerful and conspicuously well-made. They praised the Sichel sisters for telling a story of adolescence and friendship which is at once honest, realistic and authentic, while remaining subtle, subdued and compassionate. Emanuel Levy called it complex and interesting, and Marjorie Baumgarten called it a film for \\"riot grrrls of all ages\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised it as a confident first feature but said that it has more style than substance. Its detractors included Don Willmot, who found it melodramatic, and E!, which described it as titillating but contrived; \\"a walk on the mild side\\". Alison Folland was widely praised by critics for her performance as Claude. Emanuel Levy called her an instinctive actress who \\"dominates every frame of the picture\\". Janet Maslin said Folland brings a \\"wistful sincerity\\" to the role. Tara Subkoff was also praised for a performance compared by some to Rosanna Arquette. Not all the critics liked her portrayal of Ellen; E! called her \\"merely grating\\". With its coming-of-age theme and exploration of teenage sexuality, All Over Me drew comparisons from critics to other films, in particular Larry Clark's Kids and Maria Maggenti's The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love, both from 1995. Although similarities were noted, All Over Me was praised for its differences to these two films. E! called it gentler than Kids, and Muskewitz said All Over Me was less exploitative than that film. Emanual Levy described it as the far more interesting and complex of the two. Ron Wells said \\"thank god it's not Kids\\" and Bernstein said that \\"comparison misses the point\\". When comparing it to The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love, Emanuel Levy called All Over Me \\"much more accomplished\\". SplicedWire called it \\" an ideal companion feature for Todd Solondz's Welcome to the Dollhouse, another female-centred coming-of-age film from the mid-1990s. =Awards= All Over Me won the Teddy Award for Best Feature Film at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, the Open Palm Award at the 1997 Gotham Awards and the Outstanding Film (Limited Release) Award at the 1998 GLAAD Media Awards. Alison Folland was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. Music The film score for All Over me was composed by Miki Navazio. The soundtrack to the film was released on the TVT label on April 29, 1997. It features songs from several indie and riot grrl musicians interspersed with parts of Navazio's score. =Track listing= # \\"Hello\\" (Lori Barbero, Kat Bjelland, Maureen Herman) performed by Babes in Toyland # \\"Ellen and Claude Jammin\\" (Miki Navazio) # \\"Shy\\" performed by Ani Difranco # \\"Hole In The Ground\\" (Mary Timony) performed by Helium # \\"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\\" (Corin Tucker, Lora McFarlane) performed by Sleater-Kinney # \\"Game Song\\" (Tuscadero) performed by Tuscadero # \\"Jackie Blue\\" (Larry Lee, Steve Cash) performed by The Ozark Mountain Daredevils # \\"Claude Sees Ellen And Mark\\" (Navazio) # \\"Squeezebox Days\\" (Leisha Hailey) performed by The Murmurs # \\"Dragon Lady\\" (Carla Bozulich, Daniel Keenan, Kevin Fitzgerald, William Tutton) performed by Geraldine Fibbers # \\"Dynamite\\" (Alison Pipitone) performed by Pipitone # \\"Empty Glasses\\" (Kim Deal) performed by The Amps # \\"Descent\\" (Remy Zero) performed by Remy Zero # \\"6 a.m. Jullander Shere\\" (Tjinder Singh) performed by Cornershop # \\"The Kiss\\" (Navazio) # \\"Dimming Soul\\" (Michelle Malone) performed by Malone # \\"Pissing in a River\\" (Patti Smith, Ivan Kral) performed by Patti Smith Group # \\"Superglider\\" (Isabel Monteiro, Daron Robinson) performed by Drugstore # \\"Finale\\" (Navazio) # \\"Something's Burning\\" (12 Rounds) performed by 12 Rounds See also * List of LGBT films directed by women ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1990s teen drama films Category:1997 films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:American teen drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Lesbian-related films Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films Category:1997 LGBT-related films Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:1997 drama films Category:1997 independent films ","title":"All Over Me (film)"},{"id":"2298250","text":"Catherine Cusack (born 21 December 1968, in London) is an English actress of Irish descent, best known for portraying Nanny Carmel Finnan in long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street in 1992 and 1993.

It is a naturally occurring red/yellow dye. It is formally derived from 9,10-anthraquinone by replacement of three hydrogen atoms by hydroxyl (OH) groups. Purpurin is also called verantin, smoke Brown G, hydroxylizaric acid, and C.I. 58205. It is a minor component of the classical lake pigment \\"madder lake\\" or Rose Madder.  History  Madder root has been used for dying cloth at least since 1500 BC.Madder Root catalog entry at Natural Pigments website. Accessed on 2010-01-22. Purpurin and alizarin were isolated from the root by Pierre Robiquet and Colin, two French chemists, in 1826. They were identified as anthracene derivatives by Gr√§be and Liebermann in 1868. They also synthesized alizarin from bromoanthraquinone, which, together with the conversion of alizarin into purpurin published previously by M. F. De Lalande, provided the first synthetic route to purpurin.Chemical news and journal of industrial science, Volume 30, Page 207 The positions of the OH groups were determined by Bayer and Caro in 1874‚Äì1875. Wahl, Andre; Atack, F. W (1919) The Manufacture Of Organic Dyestuffs. G. Bell And Sons, Limited. Online version accessed on 2010-01-22. Natural occurrence Purpurin occurs in the roots of the madder plant (Rubia tinctorum), together with alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone). The root actually contains colorless glycosides of the dyes. Properties Purpurin is a crystalline solid, that forms orange needles melting at ,CRC Handbook of Chemistry & Physics, 90th Ed. but becomes red when dissolved in ethanol, and yellow when dissolved with alkalis in boiling water. It is insoluble in hexane but soluble in chloroform, and can be obtained from chloroform as reddish needles. Unlike alizarin, purpurin is dissolved by boiling in a solution of aluminum sulfate, from which it can be precipitated by acid. This procedure can be used to separate the two dyes.Irving Wetherbee Fay (1919) The chemistry of the coal-tar dyes. Van Nostrand Online version accessed on 2010-01-22. Like many dihydroxy- and trihydroxyanthraquinones, pupurin has a purgative action, although only 1/20 as effective as 1,2,7-trihydroxyanthraquinone (anthrapurpurin).

Online version at archive.org, accessed on 2010-01-30. Uses Purpurin is a fast dye for cotton printing and forms complexes with various metal ions. However it fades faster than alizarin on exposure to sunlight. A study published in Nature journal Scientific Reports suggests that the purpurin could replace cobalt in lithium-ion batteries. Eliminating cobalt would mean eliminating a hazardous material, allow batteries to be produced at room temperature, and lower the cost of recycling batteries. Extracting purpurin from farmed madder is a simple task; alternately, the chemical could be synthesized in a lab.

The island is accessible from the mainland at low tide by means of a causeway. History The castle is located in what was once the very volatile border area between England and Scotland. Not only did the English and Scots fight, but the area was frequently attacked by Vikings. The castle was built in 1550, around the time that Lindisfarne Priory went out of use, and stones from the priory were used as building material. It is very small by the usual standards, and was more of a fort. The castle sits on the highest point of the island, a whinstone hill called Beblowe. Lindisfarne's position in the North Sea made it vulnerable to attack from Scots and Norsemen, and by Tudor times it was clear there was a need for a stronger fortification, although by this time the Norsemen were no longer a danger. This resulted in the creation of the fort on Beblowe Crag between 1570 and 1572 which forms the basis of the present castle. Depiction of the castle in the 1840s After Henry VIII suppressed the priory, his troops used the remains as a naval store. In 1542 Henry VIII ordered the Earl of Rutland to fortify the site against possible Scottish invasion. By December 1547, Ralph Cleisbye, Captain of the fort, had guns that included a wheel-mounted demi-culverin, 2 brass sakers, a falcon, and another fixed demi-culverin.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries, (1998), 134. However, Beblowe Crag itself was not fortified until 1549 and Sir Richard Lee saw only a decayed platform and turf rampart there in 1565. Elizabeth I then had work carried out on the fort, strengthening it and providing gun platforms for the new developments in artillery technology. These works in 1570 and 1571 cost ¬£1191.Colvin, Howard, ed., The History of the King's Works, vol. 4 part 2, HMSO (1982), 674‚Äì679. When James I came to power in England, he combined the Scottish and English thrones, and the need for the castle declined. At this time the castle was still garrisoned from Berwick and protected the small Lindisfarne Harbour. In the eighteenth century, the castle was occupied briefly by Jacobite rebels, but was quickly recaptured by soldiers from Berwick who imprisoned the rebels; they dug their way out and hid for nine days close to nearby Bamburgh Castle before making good their escape. The castle during the 2016-2018 renovation In later years the castle was used as a coastguard look-out and became something of a tourist attraction. Charles Rennie Mackintosh made a sketch of the old fort in 1901. In 1901, it became the property of Edward Hudson, a publishing magnate and the owner of Country Life magazine. He had it refurbished in the Arts and Crafts style by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It is said that Hudson and the architect came across the building while touring Northumberland and climbed over the wall to explore inside. The walled garden, which had originally been the garrison's vegetable plot, was designed by Lutyens' long-time friend and collaborator, Gertrude Jekyll between 1906 and 1912. It is some distance away from the castle itself. Between 2002 and 2006 it was restored to Jekyll's original planting plan which is now held in the Reef Collection at the University of California, Berkeley. The castle, garden and nearby lime kilns have been in the care of the National Trust since 1944 and are open to visitors. Lutyens used upturned disused boats (herring busses) as sheds. In 2005, two of the boats were destroyed by arson. They were replaced in 2006 and the third boat has now been renovated by the National Trust. The replacement of the two burned boats by two new boat sheds features on a DVD Diary of an Island. This shows a fishing boat from Leith being cut in half in a boatyard in Eyemouth and the two \\"sheds\\" being transported to the island and lifted into place by crane. The Spanish architect Enric Miralles used Lutyens' upturned herring busses as an inspiration for his design of the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.BBC NEWS  Scotland  Scots Parliament architect dies The castle was closed for major renovation and restoration works from November 2016 to April 2018. Lutyens' renovation Castle entrance The entrance to the castle is quite dramatic and involves a steep climb around the rocky base. Lutyens' original slope was unprotected by either rails or fences in an attempt to emphasise the exposed nature of the site. When the future George V and Queen Mary visited in 1908, it is said they were alarmed by the slope and the cobbled surface. Once inside the castle, the entrance hall is sectioned off by large stone pillars, somewhat reminiscent of a church nave with the dark reddish-brown of the stone contrasting with the whitewashed plasterwork. The space is completed by a bare stone floor. The kitchen is almost as bare, and is dominated by a large stone fireplace. Here, as at Castle Drogo, Lutyens uses the space in interesting ways. Throughout the castle, he has used stone, brick, slate and wood to create simple forms, and uses textures to demonstrate a rustic, spartan life-style. Despite being a castle it remains a homely space where the human scale is room size, but with incongruous architectural elements. In the scullery there is a tiny window over a stone sink surrounded by the mechanism used to operate the portcullis. After descending to the dining room one is inside the remnants of the Tudor fort. The vaults here and in the adjacent ship room are entirely functional as they support the gun battery above. The wide chimney-piece contains an old bread-oven; here Lutyens has emphasised the age of the room with Neo-Gothic traceried windows framed by curtains which swing out to lie flat along the wall. One of the end walls is painted a rich Prussian blue, which contrasts with the herring-bone patterned red-brick floor. Next door is the ship room where a green wall fulfils a similar role. The furniture is in keeping, with much dark wood in the tables and cabinets. The few upholstered chairs and sofas have now faded to gentle tones. The largest bedroom, the east, is bright and airy and again has curtains on pull-out poles. The long gallery was a new space created by Lutyens, intended to echo the grand galleries of Elizabethan and Jacobean houses. The scale is much smaller, but again the use of exposed stone arches and oak beams provides a grand yet rustic feel. Further on, an upper gallery has a raised platform at one end. From here an oak door leads onto the upper battery with its views along the coastline. The music room at the castle was used by Guilhermina Suggia, and a cello is left in the room today to mark her frequent visits.  Filming location  Lindisfarne Castle has provided a shooting location for a number of films. Roman Polanski's 1966 Cul-de-sac, starring Donald Pleasence, Lionel Stander and Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac, was shot entirely in and around the castle. It serves as the residence for Pleasence and Dorl√©ac's characters. Polanski later returned to the castle to shoot scenes for his The Tragedy of Macbeth (1971), in which it stands in for Glamis Castle. The castle's use in Macbeth inspired the producers of the TV series Cold Feet (1998‚Äì2003) to use it as an exterior filming location in one episode, though interior scenes were shot at Hoghton Tower in Lancashire.Tibballs, Geoff (2000). Cold Feet: The Best Bits‚Ä¶. London: Granada Media: p. 211\\\\. . It was also used as a stand-in for Mont San Pierre in the 1982 film The Scarlet Pimpernel starring Anthony Andrews. In the British television show Wolfblood, filming was done there for an episode. Some external shots of the castle are used in the fourth season of the period television drama Reign.

They were record producer Phil Spector's first vocal group. History Following graduation from Fairfax high school in Los Angeles, California, Phil Spector became obsessed with \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\", a song he had written for his group, the Teddy Bears. After a hasty audition at Era Records, which offered to finance a studio session, the Teddy Bears ‚Äì Phil Spector, Marshall Leib, Harvey Goldstein (who left the group early on), lead singer Annette Kleinbard, and last minute recruit, drummer Sandy Nelson ‚Äì recorded the song at Gold Star Studios at a cost of $75. Released on Era's Dor√© label in August 1958, it took two months before \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\" began to get airplay. It went on to become a global hit. The record stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 for 23 weeks, in the Top Ten for 11 of those weeks, and commanded the number 1 chart position for three weeks. It also reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over two and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. At 19 years old, Spector had written, arranged, played, sung, and produced the best-selling record in the country. Although subsequent releases by the Teddy Bears on the Imperial label were well-recorded soft pop, they did not sell, and within a year of the debut, Spector disbanded the group. Their demise was hastened by Kleinbard being seriously injured in 1960 in a car accident. Spector was not the only Teddy Bear who went on to a career after the group broke up. Harvey Goldstein became a certified public accountant. Annette Kleinbard continued to write and record songs, and changed her name to Carol Connors. Among her credits are the Rip Chords hit \\"Hey Little Cobra\\", and the Academy Awards nominated Rocky theme song, \\"Gonna Fly Now,\\" co-written with Ayn Robbins. Leib joined the Hollywood Argyles, played guitar on some of Duane Eddy's records and produced material recorded by the Everly Brothers amongst others. Discography ;Studio album *The Teddy Bears Sing!

The defendant may question both the memory of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the identification is the result of a false memory), and the perception of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the witness had poor eyesight, or that the crime occurred in a poorly lit place). Because the prosecution in a criminal case must prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must convince the jury that there is reasonable doubt about whether the witness actually saw what he or she claims to have seen, or recalls having seen. Although scientific studies have shown that mistaken identity is a common phenomenon, jurors give very strong credence to eyewitness testimony, particularly where the eyewitness is resolute in believing that their identification of the defendant was correct.  Studies  Researchers like Elizabeth Loftus have challenged eyewitness testimony based on the fact that people's memory can be distorted. In her study she questioned eyewitnesses about a videotape of a car accident. Witnesses were asked \\"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\\" However, some witnesses were asked the same question with the verb \\"hit\\" replaced by the verb \\"smashed\\". Those who were asked the question with \\"smashed\\" as the verb said the cars were moving faster than those who were asked the same question with the verb \\"hit.\\" Additionally, when asked if there was broken glass at the scene, those who heard \\"smashed\\" were more likely to say there was than those who heard \\"hit.\\" There was no broken glass in the videotape. Hers is only one example of studies that show memory can be susceptible to distortions.  Case studies  With genetic fingerprinting and DNA evidence now commonplace, many convictions based on eyewitness testimony are being re-examined. According to statistics, over 75% of the cases of DNA exonerations have involved mistaken eyewitness identification. Abraham Lincoln used mistaken identity as a defense for William \\"Duff\\" Armstrong in 1858. He referred to a farmer's almanac to prove that a witness could not have seen Armstrong in the moonlight, as claimed, because the position of the moon that night would not have provided sufficient illumination. Armstrong was acquitted. =Adolf Beck= A famous case of mistaken identity in the United Kingdom is the case of Adolf Beck, who served several years in prison as a swindler, was released upon completion of his sentence, and then arrested again on the same charges before the actual swindler of similar appearance was apprehended. =Ronald Cotton= Another case demonstrating mistaken identity is the case of American Ronald Cotton. In 1984, Jennifer Thompson was raped. During the attack, she studied the attacker's face, determined to identify him if she survived the attack. When presented with a photo lineup, she identified Cotton as her attacker. Twice, she testified against him by saying she had identified him. When presented with Bobby Poole, an inmate who boasted to fellow inmates that he had committed the crimes for which Cotton was convicted, she said she had never seen him before. After Cotton served 10.5 years of his sentence, attorneys arranged for DNA testing of him and Poole. Poole's DNA matched that collected from Thompson's rape kit, proving that he had raped her. Thompson has since become a critic of eyewitness testimony because of its proven unreliability. She was filled with remorse after learning that she had contributed to Cotton, an innocent man, being convicted and sent to prison. Upon release for wrongful conviction (proved by DNA analysis), Cotton was awarded $109,150.69 in compensation from the state of North Carolina. Cotton and Thompson have reconciled and become close friends; they conduct speaking tours to promote reform of procedures for eyewitness testimony. After Cotton was released, Poole was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to raping Thompson., Common Dreams She wrote to him but he never responded. He died in prison in 2000., People SODDI defense The SODDI defense (\\"Some Other Dude Did It\\" or \\"Some Other Dude Done It\\") is often used when there is no question that a crime occurred, such as in murder or assault cases, where the defendant is not asserting self-defense. The SODDI defense in a murder, rape or assault case is often accompanied by a mistaken identity defense and/or an alibi defense. Another common scenario where the SODDI defense is available is where the police find contraband in a car or residence containing multiple people. In this scenario, each person present could assert that one of the other people possessed the contraband. The defense does carry a risk: It may be legal in some jurisdictions to falsely assert one's innocence while it is illegal to falsely blame another person for the crime. In Holmes v.

The plant is treated as a kind of biological factory, which processes light, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients into harvestable parts. Main parameters kept into consideration are temperature, sunlight, standing crop biomass, plant production distribution, nutrient and water supply. Modelling Modelling is essential in theoretical production ecology. Unit of modelling usually is the crop, the assembly of plants per standard surface unit. Analysis results for an individual plant are generalised to the standard surface, e.g. the leaf area index is the projected surface area of all crop leaves above a unit area of ground. =Processes= The usual system of describing plant production divides the plant production process into at least five separate processes, which are influenced by several external parameters. Two cycles of biochemical reactions constitute the basis of plant production, the light reaction and the dark reaction.Amthor JS (2010) From sunlight to phytomass: on the potential efficiency of converting solar radiation to phyto- energy. New Phytologist 188:939-959 * In the light reaction, sunlight photons are absorbed by chloroplasts which split water into an electron, proton and oxygen radical which is recombined with another radical and released as molecular oxygen. The recombination of the electron with the proton yields the energy carriers NADH and ATP. The rate of this reaction often depends on sunlight intensity, leaf area index, leaf angle and amount of chloroplasts per leaf surface unit. The maximum theoretical gross production rate under optimum growth conditions is approximately 250 kg per hectare per day. * The dark reaction or Calvin cycle ties atmospheric carbon dioxide and uses NADH and ATP to convert it into sucrose. The available NADH and ATP, as well as temperature and carbon dioxide levels determine the rate of this reaction. Together those two reactions are termed photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis is determined by the interaction of a number of factors including temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide. * The produced carbohydrates are transported to other plant parts, such as storage organs and converted into secondary products, such as amino acids, lipids, cellulose and other chemicals needed by the plant or used for respiration. Lipids, sugars, cellulose and starch can be produced without extra elements. The conversion of carbohydrates into amino acids and nucleic acids requires nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. Chlorophyll production requires magnesium, while several enzymes and coenzymes require trace elements. This means, nutrient supply influences this part of the production chain. Water supply is essential for transport, hence limits this too. * The production centers, i.e. the leaves, are sources, the storage organs, growth tips or other destinations for the photosynthetic production are sinks. The lack of sinks can be a limiting factor for production too, as happens e.g. in apple orchards where insects or night frost have destroyed the blossoms and the produced assimilates cannot be converted into apples. Biennial and perennial plants employ the stored starch and fats in their storage organs to produce new leaves and shoots the next year. * The amount of crop biomass and the relative distribution of biomass over leaves, stems, roots and storage organs determines the respiration rate. The amount of biomass in leaves determines the leaf area index, which is important in calculating the gross photosynthetic production. * extensions to this basic model can include insect and pest damage, intercropping, climatic changes, etc. =Parameters= Important parameters in theoretical production models thus are: ;Climate: * Temperature ‚Äì The temperature determines the speed of respiration and the dark reaction. A high temperature combined with a low intensity of sunlight means a high loss by respiration. A low temperature combined with a high intensity of sunlight means that NADH and ATP heap up but cannot be converted into glucose because the dark reaction cannot process them swiftly enough. * Light ‚Äì Light, also called photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) is the energy source for green plant growth. PAR powers the light reaction, which provides ATP and NADPH for the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and molecular oxygen. When temperature, moisture, carbon dioxide and nutrient levels are optimal, light intensity determines maximum production level. * Carbon dioxide levels ‚Äì Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the sole carbon source for plants. About half of all proteins in green leaves have the sole purpose of capturing carbon dioxide. :Although CO2 levels are constant under natural circumstances [on the contrary, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily for 200 years], CO2 fertilization is common in greenhouses and is known to increase yields by on average 24% [a specific value, e.g., 24%, is meaningless without specification of the \\"low\\" and \\"high\\" CO2 levels being compared]. :C4 plants like maize and sorghum can achieve a higher yield at high solar radiation intensities, because they prevent the leaking of captured carbon dioxide due of the spatial separation of carbon dioxide capture and carbon dioxide use in the dark reaction. This means that their photorespiration is almost zero. This advantage is sometimes offset by a higher rate of maintenance respiration. In most models for natural crops, carbon dioxide levels are assumed to be constant. ;Crop: * Standing crop biomass ‚Äì Unlimited growth is an exponential process, which means that the amount of biomass determines the production. Because an increased biomass implies higher respiration per surface unit and a limited increase in intercepted light, crop growth is a sigmoid function of crop biomass. * Plant production distribution ‚Äì Usually only a fraction of the total plant biomass consists of useful products, e.g. the seeds in pulses and cereals, the tubers in potato and cassava, the leaves in sisal and spinach etc. The yield of usable plant portions will increase when the plant allocates more nutrients to this parts, e.g. the high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice allocate 40% of their biomass into wheat and rice grains, while the traditional varieties achieve only 20%, thus doubling the effective yield. :Different plant organs have a different respiration rate, e.g. a young leaf has a much higher respiration rate than roots, storage tissues or stems do. There is a distinction between \\"growth respiration\\" and \\"maintenance respiration\\". :Sinks, such as developing fruits, need to be present. They are usually represented by a discrete switch, which is turned on after a certain condition, e.g. critical daylength has been met. ;Care: * Water supply ‚Äì Because plants use passive transport to transfer water and nutrients from their roots to the leaves, water supply is essential to growth, even so that water efficiency rates are known for different crops, e.g. 5000 for sugar cane, meaning that each kilogram of produced sugar requires up to 5000 liters of water. * Nutrient supply ‚Äì Nutrient supply has a twofold effect on plant growth. A limitation in nutrient supply will limit biomass production as per Liebig's Law of the Minimum. With some crops, several nutrients influence the distribution of plant products in the plants. A nitrogen gift is known to stimulate leaf growth and therefore can work adversely on the yield of crops which are accumulating photosynthesis products in storage organs, such as ripening cereals or fruit-bearing fruit trees.  Phases in crop growth  Theoretical production ecology assumes that the growth of common agricultural crops, such as cereals and tubers, usually consists of four (or five) phases: * Germination ‚Äì Agronomical research has indicated a temperature dependence of germination time (GT, in days). Each crop has a unique critical temperature (CT, dimension temperature) and temperature sum (dimensions temperature times time), which are related as follows. :: GT = \\\\frac{TS}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^N (T-T_\\\\text{crit})} :When a crop has a temperature sum of e.g. 150 ¬∞C¬∑d and a critical temperature of 10 ¬∞C, it will germinate in 15 days when temperature is 20 ¬∞C, but in 10 days when temperature is 25 ¬∞C. When the temperature sum exceeds the threshold value, the germination process is complete. * Initial spread ‚Äì In this phase, the crop does not cover the field yet. The growth of the crop is linearly dependent on leaf area index, which in its turn is linearly dependent on crop biomass. As a result, crop growth in this phase is exponential. * Total coverage of field ‚Äì in this phase, growth is assumed to be linearly dependent on incident light and respiration rate, as nearly 100% of all incident light is intercepted. Typically, the Leaf Area Index (LAI) is above two to three in this phase. This phase of vegetative growth ends when the plant gets a certain environmental or internal signal and starts generative growth (as in cereals and pulses) or the storage phase (as in tubers). * Allocation to storage organs ‚Äì in this phase, up to 100% of all production is directed to the storage organs. Generally, the leaves are still intact and as a result, gross primary production stays the same. Prolonging this phase, e.g. by careful fertilization, water and pest management results directly in a higher harvest. * Ripening ‚Äì in this phase, leaves and other production structures slowly die off. Their carbohydrates and proteins are transported to the storage organs. As a result, the LAI and, hence, the primary production decreases.  Existing plant production models  Plant production models exist in varying levels of scope (cell, physiological, individual plant, crop, geographical region, global) and of generality: the model can be crop-specific or be more generally applicable. In this section the emphasis will be on crop-level based models as the crop is the main area of interest from an agronomical point of view. As of 2005, several crop production models are in use. The crop growth model SUCROS has been developed during more than 20 years and is based on earlier models. Its latest revision known dates from 1997. The IRRI and Wageningen University more recently developed the rice growth model ORYZA2000. This model is used for modeling rice growth. Both crop growth models are open source. Other more crop-specific plant growth models exist as well. =SUCROS= SUCROS is programmed in the Fortran computer programming language. The model can and has been applied to a variety of weather regimes and crops. Because the source code of Sucros is open source, the model is open to modifications of users with FORTRAN programming experience. The official maintained version of SUCROS comes into two flavours: SUCROS I, which has non-inhibited unlimited crop growth (which means that only solar radiation and temperature determine growth) and SUCROS II, in which crop growth is limited only by water shortage. =ORYZA2000= The ORYZA2000 rice growth model has been developed at the IRRI in cooperation with Wageningen University. This model, too, is programmed in FORTRAN. The scope of this model is limited to rice, which is the main food crop for Asia. =Other models= The United States Department of Agriculture has sponsored a number of applicable crop growth models for various major US crops, such as cotton, soy bean, wheat and rice. Other widely used models are the precursor of SUCROS (SWATR), CERES, several incarnations of PLANTGRO, SUBSTOR, the FAO- sponsored CROPWAT, AGWATER, the erosion-specific model EPIC, and the cropping system CropSyst. A less mechanistic growth and competition model, called the conductance model, has been developed, mainly at Warwick-HRI, Wellesbourne, UK. This model simulates light interception and growth of individual plants based on the lateral expansion of their crown zone areas. Competition between plants is simulated by a set algorithms related to competition for space and resultant light intercept as the canopy closes. Some versions of the model assume overtopping of some species by others. Although the model cannot take account of water or mineral nutrients, it can simulate individual plant growth, variability in growth within plant communities and inter-species competition. This model was written in Matlab. See Benjamin and Park (2007) Weed Research 47, 284‚Äì298 for a recent review.

The Neo-charismatic movement is considered to be the \\"third wave\\" of the Charismatic Christian tradition which began with Pentecostalism (the \\"first wave\\"), and was furthered by the Charismatic movement (the \\"second wave\\"). As a result of the growth of postdenominational and independent charismatic groups, Neo-charismatics are now believed to be more numerous than the first and second wave categories.. As of 2002, some 19,000 denominations or groups, with approximately 295 million individual adherents, were identified as Neo-charismatic. History The True Jesus Church is a Neo-charismatic church founded in Beijing, China. This particular True Jesus Church serves the Chinese community in Edinburgh. The \\"first wave\\" of Charismatic Christianity is Pentecostalism, which originated in 1901 in Kansas and later spread to Texas, Los Angeles, and then to other countries. Pentecostals formed their own churches and organizations, but by the 1960s their emphasis on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and signs and wonders began to influence mainline Protestant denominations and the \\"second wave,\\" or the charismatic movement, began. The Neo-charismatic movement, dubbed the \\"third wave\\", dates from the early 1980s and was a result of the growth of Pentecostal experiences among independent and indigenous Christian groups. Although the Neo-charismatic movement emerged in the 1980s, many churches in Africa were already exhibiting Neo-charismatic tendencies in the early twentieth century as some churches combined indigenous cosmologies with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The greatest concentration of Neo-charismatic churches is found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In some regions, especially Africa and Latin America, Neo-charismatics are sometimes condemned by Pentecostals and Charismatics for their spiritual practices or for combining local cosmologies with Christian beliefs. C. Peter Wagner is a leader among Neo-charismatics in the U.S., and is known for naming the Neo- charismatic movement the \\"third wave\\" of Charismatic Christianity. Peter Wagner, who originally called this form of Christianity the \\"Third Wave\\" and is a theoretician of the Church Growth Movement, advocated for the principle of spiritual warfare against demons through his book Spiritual Power and Church Growth.Yannick Fer, La th√©ologie du \\"combat spirituel\\": Globalisation autochtonie et politique en milieu pentec√¥tiste/charismatique, in J. Garcia- Ruiz et P. Michel (eds.), N√©o-pentec√¥tismes, Labex Tepsis, pp. 52-64, 2016.Wagner, Peter C. Spiritual Power and Church Growth, Altamonte Springs, Fl. Strang Communications, USA, 1986. John Wimber, who founded the Association of Vineyard Churches in 1982, put forward the principle of \\"miraculous healing\\" as an element of the Christian life in his book Power Healing. The current of \\"power evangelism\\" was developed through the work of John Wimber and publicized through his book Power Evangelism. Together, Wagner and Wimber taught a course on Neo-charismatic spiritual gifts called \\"Signs, Wonders, and Church Growth\\" at Fuller Theological Seminary for four years starting in 1982. George Otis Junior is one of the originators of \\"spiritual mapping,\\" which is a practice among some third wave adherents that includes uncovering the histories of buildings and geographical locations to understand how those histories might be contributing to demonic possession in the present. In 2011, the movement (grouped with the charismatic movement), has 305 million people. Pew Research Center, Global Christianity ‚Äì A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World‚Äôs Christian Population, USA, December 19, 2011 Defining characteristics In terms of congregational governance, no single form, structure, or style of church service characterizes all Neo- charismatic services and churches. The Neo-charismatic categorization is broad and diverse and includes any group that is not considered Pentecostal or Charismatic but still emphasizes the power of the Holy spirit and supernatural signs and wonders. Pentecostals comprise Pentecostal denominations, charismatics bring Pentecostal tendencies to mainline denominations, but Neo- charismatics are indigenous, independent, post- and non-denominational Christian groups without formal denominational ties. The term non- denominational is used more often by churches than the Neo-charismatic term.Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 66 Example of laying on of hands during a service in Ghana. Members of the Neo-charismatic movement, like those in the Pentecostal movement and Charismatic movement, believe in and stress the post-Biblical availability of gifts of the Holy Spirit. These spiritual gifts, or charismata, frequently include but are not limited to glossolalia (speaking in tongues), healing, and prophecy. Additionally, Neo- charismatic Christians practice the laying on of hands and seek the \\"infilling\\" of the Holy Spirit, although a specific experience of baptism with the Holy Spirit may not be requisite for experiencing such gifts. Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, Jan Milic Lochman, John Mbiti, Jaroslav Pelikan, The Encyclodedia of Christianity, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 2008, p. 445-446 Young-hoon Lee, The Holy Spirit Movement in Korea: Its Historical and Theological Development, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 4 Neo-charismatic practices look very similar to Pentecostal and Charismatic practices, but the terminology used by Neo-charismatics to describe their practices is distinctly different from the typical terminology used by Pentecostals and Charismatics. Many Neo-charismatics believe that the \\"end times\\" are near, practice intercessory prayer that invokes the power of the Holy Spirit, and view their work as helping to transform the Church into the Kingdom of God on earth.McAlister, Elizabeth. \\"Possessing the Land for Jesus.\\" In Spirited Things: The Work of \\"Possession\\" in Afro-Atlantic Religions, edited by Paul Christopher Johnson, 177-205.Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2014. p. 179. Similar to many Pentecostal and Charismatic groups, Neo-charismatics use electronic means of communication for broadcasting messages and worship services on social media, websites, radio stations, and television channels. Use of media resources enables Neo- charismatics to reach new audiences and grow their networks by reaching previously unreached people through technological means, and such communication has allowed for \\"democratized access to the Holy Spirit\\" because of the increasing forms of media that have been made available.  Notable practices  Due to the diversity among churches and organizations that can be classified under the Neo-charismatic label, not all Neo-charismatics adhere to the following practices even if many of them do observe these sorts of rituals and beliefs. = Spiritual warfare = The fight against spiritual demons occupies an important place in Neo-charismatic teachings and prayers. The exorcising of demons is sometimes also referred to as deliverance ministries because a person or object is \\"delivered\\" or saved from an evil spiritual force. Spiritual mapping, a subset of practices under the broad umbrella of spiritual warfare, is the process by which defiled land, houses, and churches are discovered through careful observation of the history of the region and are subsequently illustrated on a map. A relatively well-known example of this type of spiritual mapping occurred in Amarillo, Texas by the group Repent Amarillo.McConeghy, David Walker. \\"Geographies of Prayer: Place and Religion in Modern America.\\" PhD diss., University of California Santa Barbara, 2013, p.75. If traumatic or evil histories are uncovered, mass exorcisms are sometimes organized to drive out territorial demons or historical demons in an ancestral line. \\"Prayerwalking\\" is also an encouraged form of spiritual warfare among some Neo-charismatics and is connected to spiritual mapping. In prayerwalking, believers pray against evil spirits while walking through areas that are known as places where historical evil took place or are places where evil takes place currently.McConeghy, David Walker. \\"Geographies of Prayer: Place and Religion in Modern America.\\" PhD diss., University of California Santa Barbara, 2013, p. 14. = Power evangelism = The ability to bring about \\"signs and wonders\\" by Christians who have confessed their belief in the Holy Spirit and have been anointed to do miracles is an important aspect of Neo-charismatic evangelism. Healing and financial prosperity are examples of \\"power encounters,\\" or supernatural acts, that occur in this type of evangelism.George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 87 Neo- charismatics believe power evangelism, in which supernatural wonders accompany the sharing of the Gospel message, is more effective than evangelism without signs and is more similar to the type of evangelism that first century Christians used. = Structural renewal = Some Neo-charismatics are interested in the reconfiguration of church leadership to reflect a structure they believe is upheld in Ephesians 4:11-13, \\"The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.\\"Eph. 4:11-13, New Revised Standard Version Bible In this passage, there are five \\"offices,\\" including apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor and teacher. Pastors, teachers, and evangelists are commonly found in evangelical churches, but some Neo-charismatic groups and movements, like Five Fold Ministry and the New Apostolic Reformation, seek to restructure their church organization to actively include apostles and prophets.John Weaver, The New Apostolic Reformation: History of a Modern Charismatic Movement, McFarland & Company, USA, 2016, p. 87  Controversies  Various Christian groups have criticized the Pentecostal and charismatic movement for too much attention to mystics manifestations, such as glossolalia which would be the most important spiritual sign for a believer, falls to the ground, moans and cries, during worship services, as well as his anti-intellectualism. Wolfgang Vondey, Pentecostalism: A Guide for the Perplexed, A&C; Black, UK, 2012, p. 37-38 In 2013, the Evangelical pastor John F. MacArthur criticized the charismatic movement for the majority support for prosperity theology which led to financial scandals and moral, its proximity to the New Age where God is presented as a servant of the needs of believers, false prophecies and disorderly worship services.

It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2) in broadleaf canopies. In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used: *Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground surface area *Projected (or one-sided, in accordance the definition for broadleaf canopies) needle area per unit ground area *Total needle surface area per unit ground area The definition ‚Äúhalf the total leaf area‚Äù pertains to biological processes, such as gas exchange, whereas the definition ‚Äúprojected leaf area‚Äù was disregarded because the projection of a given area in one direction may differ in another direction when leaves are not flat, thick, or 3D-shaped. Moreover, ‚Äúground surface area‚Äù is specifically defined as ‚Äúhorizontal ground surface area‚Äù to clarify LAI on a sloping surface. The definition ‚Äúhalf the total leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area‚Äù is suitable for all kinds of leaves and flat or sloping surfaces.  Interpretation and application  right LAI is a measure for the total area of leaves per unit ground area and directly related to the amount of light that can be intercepted by plants. It is an important variable used to predict photosynthetic primary production, evapotranspiration and as a reference tool for crop growth. As such, LAI plays an essential role in theoretical production ecology. An inverse exponential relation between LAI and light interception, which is linearly proportional to the primary production rate, has been established:Firman, D. M., and E. J. Allen. ‚ÄúRelationship between Light Interception, Ground Cover and Leaf Area Index in Potatoes.‚Äù The Journal of Agricultural Science 113, no. 3 (December 1989): 355‚Äì59. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859600070040. https://www.niab.com/uploads/files/Light_interception_ground_cover_LAI_Firman_Allen_1989.pdfAsner, Gregory P, Jonathan M O Scurlock, and Jeffrey A Hicke. ‚ÄúGlobal Synthesis of Leaf Area Index Observations: Implications for Ecological and Remote Sensing Studies.‚Äù Global Ecology, 2003, 15. http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~mdisney/teaching/teachingNEW/GMES/LAI_GLOBAL_RS.pdf :P=P_\\\\max \\\\left(1-e^{-c\\\\cdot LAI}\\\\right) where Pmax designates the maximum primary production and c designates a crop-specific growth coefficient. This inverse exponential function is called the primary production function. LAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).  Determining LAI  LAI can be determined directly by taking a statistically significant sample of foliage from a plant canopy, measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area. Indirect methods measure canopy geometry or light extinction and relate it to LAI. =Direct methods= Direct methods can be easily applied on deciduous species by collecting leaves during leaf fall in traps of certain area distributed below the canopy. The area of the collected leaves can be measured using a leaf area meter or an image scanner and image analysis software (ImageJ) and mobile applications (Leafscan, Petiole, Easy Leaf Area). The measured leaf area can then be divided by the area of the traps to obtain LAI. Alternatively, leaf area can be measured on a sub-sample of the collected leaves and linked to the leaf dry mass (e.g. via Specific Leaf Area, SLA cm2/g). That way it is not necessary to measure the area of all leaves one by one, but weigh the collected leaves after drying (at 60‚Äì80 ¬∞C for 48 h). Leaf dry mass multiplied by the specific leaf area is converted into leaf area. Direct methods in evergreen species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area. It is very difficult (and also unethical) to apply such destructive techniques in natural ecosystems, particularly in forests of evergreen tree species. Foresters have developed techniques that determine leaf area in evergreen forests through allometric relationships. Due to the difficulties and the limitations of the direct methods for estimating LAI, they are mostly used as reference for indirect methods that are easier and faster to apply. =Indirect methods= hemispherical photograph of forest canopy. The ratio of the area of canopy to sky is used to approximate LAI. Indirect methods of estimating LAI in situ can be divided in two categories: # indirect contact LAI measurements such as plumb lines and inclined point quadrats # indirect non-contact measurements Due to the subjectivity and labor involved with the first method, indirect non-contact measurements are typically preferred. Non-contact LAI tools, such as hemispherical photography, Hemiview Plant Canopy Analyser from Delta-T Devices, the CI-110 Plant Canopy Analyzer from CID Bio-Science, LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer from LI-COR Biosciences and the LP-80 LAI ceptometer from Decagon Devices, measure LAI in a non-destructive way. Hemispherical photography methods estimate LAI and other canopy structure attributes from analyzing upward-looking fisheye photographs taken beneath the plant canopy. The LAI-2200 calculates LAI and other canopy structure attributes from solar radiation measurements made with a wide-angle optical sensor. Measurements made above and below the canopy are used to determine canopy light interception at five angles, from which LAI is computed using a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies. The LP-80 calculates LAI by means of measuring the difference between light levels above the canopy and at ground level, and factoring in the leaf angle distribution, solar zenith angle, and plant extinction coefficient. Such indirect methods, where LAI is calculated based upon observations of other variables (canopy geometry, light interception, leaf length and width, etc.) are generally faster, amenable to automation, and thereby allow for a larger number of spatial samples to be obtained. For reasons of convenience when compared to the direct (destructive) methods, these tools are becoming more and more important. =Disadvantages of methods= The disadvantage of the direct method is that it is destructive, time consuming and expensive, especially if the study area is very large. The disadvantage of the indirect method is that in some cases it can underestimate the value of LAI in very dense canopies, as it does not account for leaves that lie on each other, and essentially act as one leaf according to the theoretical LAI models. Ignorance of non-randomness within canopies may cause underestimation of LAI up to 25%, introducing path length distribution in the indirect method can improve the measuring accuracy of LAI.

Here the road forks, with the Port Wakefield Road (A1 - National Highway 1) continuing to the north, and the Main North Road turning northeast and continuing as route A20. It continues through the outer northern suburbs, passing Mawson Lakes and Salisbury, crossing the Little Para River and passing Elizabeth and Smithfield before entering Gawler. In Gawler, it crosses the South Para and North Para Rivers, and the Barossa Valley Way branches to the east between them. Just north of Gawler, it passes under the Sturt Highway which heads east to the Barossa Valley, Riverland, northern Victoria and New South Wales. This is where the name Horrocks Highway takes over from the historic name of Main North Road. The environment changes from the urban environment to undulating land, mostly cleared for grain cropping. Several of the towns have grain storage bunkers or silos. It crosses the Light River then crosses and follows the Gilbert River to where the Barrier Highway branches northeast towards Riverton and Burra. Over the next ridge, it crosses the Wakefield River and enters the southern end of the Clare Valley. The dominant scenery changes from grain crops to grapevines from Auburn to Clare, then returns to grain fields again north of the Hutt River as it passes through the Southern Flinders Ranges. It crosses the Broughton River near Yacka and on to Wilmington at the eastern side of Horrocks Pass. As the Horrocks Highway is in the valley between the southern Flinders Ranges and northern Mount Lofty Ranges, it is in the relatively wetter climate south of Goyder's Line. At Wilmington, Main North Road diverges from the Horrocks Highway. Main North Road turns northwest from Wilmington to pass through Horrocks Pass to Winninowie where it meets the Augusta Highway south of Port Augusta. The Horrocks Highway continues northwards from Wilmington to Quorn. Commuter route In the metropolitan area, the road is a major commuter route to the central business district in the Adelaide city centre. The portion of Main North Road between the city centre and Mawson Lakes is a 15-minute public transport 'Go Zone', with the maximum wait for a bus being 15 minutes during peak times (7:30 am ‚Äì 6:30 pm weekdays) and 30 minutes on weekends and evenings. Bus routes via Main North Road generally begin with the prefix \\"22x\\". The bus service is provided by SouthLink for Adelaide Metro. Route numbers From North Adelaide, the route numbers used along the road are: * A1 to Gepps Cross, where it becomes National Highway A1 (part of the national Highway 1) and continues as Port Wakefield Road to Perth * A20 to north of Gawler, where National Highway A20 follows the Sturt Highway towards Sydney. * B82 through the Clare Valley and beyond to Wilmington. * B56 to Stirling North, south-east of Port Augusta. In late 2010 when the Northern Expressway was completed, National Highway A20 was diverted to the new road as National Highway M20. Main North Road and the southern section of the Gawler Bypass Road were then designated as State Route A52. In late 2016, the Northern Expressway was designated M2, and route 20 returned to Main North Road as state route A20 to Gepps Cross.

History  The gym company was launched in 1999 in Preston, Lancashire as part of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, initially headquartered in Milton Keynes. In 2013 headquarters were moved to the Barbican in London leaving a small call centre in Milton Keynes. In South Africa the company bought the assets of the 'Health and Racquet Club' chain after the latter's parent company, Leisurenet, had been placed in liquidation in October 2000 for 319.6 million South African Rand (approximately ¬£24.5m as at November 2011). The South African company also runs Virgin Life Care. In 2002, by which point the company had 350,000 members, Branson sold 55 percent of the company to Bridgepoint Capital for ¬£40 million. In 2005, Branson bought out Bridgepoint's stake in the business for ¬£134.5 million. It subsequently expanded its operations in 2004 to Italy. By 2005 the company had 25 clubs in the UK, 77 clubs in South Africa and 12 clubs in Continental Europe. It opened its first Australian club in Sydney in late 2008, with further clubs launch in Singapore and Thailand in 2014. On 1 November 2006 it took over the UK-based operation of the more prestigious Holmes Place chain, thus increasing its UK chain of clubs from 24 to 72 overnight. On 26 April 2011 it announced the takeover of UK gym operator Esporta's 55 clubs increasing the UK business to 124 clubs. In 2013, Virgin Active expanded into the South East Asian market, first opening a club in Singapore at the heart of the CBD. Located on Level 6, Tower 2, One Raffles Place. Playing a significant role in opening the first club in South East Asia was Christian Mason, the newly appointed 'Managing Director South East Asia'. Christian Mason then went on to opening 13 more clubs in both Singapore and Thailand. The current Group CEO is founder Matthew Bucknall. In 2014 Virgin Active launched a new low-cost gym called Virgin Active RED. The RED gyms focuses on first timers who may be intimidated by training by strategically placing exercise equipment in different stages around the gym and further having touch screen computers and other technologies placed in these predefined area's teaching the user how to do the exercise correctly. On 16 April 2015, it was reported that Virgin Group and their private equity backers had sold 80% of Virgin Active to the South African investment firm Brait, owned by the billionaire Christo Wiese. The sale price was ¬£682 million for an 80% stake, valuing the business at ¬£1.3 billion, including debt, and the transaction was completed in July 2015. The company will continue to operate under the Virgin Active brand. In 2016 they began the sale of 35 clubs to Nuffield health In 2017 they completed a sale of 15 clubs to David Lloyd Controversy  In December 2015, the South African Competition Tribunal announced that it is investigating Virgin Active's South African operations and the Discovery Group for contravening the Competition Act. The investigation continues. Accidents and Deaths  In March 2003, 32 year old City banker Katarzyna Woja stepped out of the lift at the Virgin Active (then Holmes Place) Broadgate Health Club in central London, when its cable snapped and the hydraulic cabin plunged downwards. Woja became trapped between the cabin's mantel and the lift shaft and was dragged downwards, suffering horrific injuries. She died soon after. Although she was with seven other people in the lift, she was the only one injured in the accident, as she was the last one to step out of the lift. Following a lengthy investigation by health and safety experts Holmes Place (bought by Virgin Active) was charged with six breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act while the lift manufacturer ThyssenKrupp was charged with four breaches. In December 2011 Virgin's flagship club in High Street Kensington was accused of covering up the death of model and city worker Elsa Carneau, who drowned in the swimming pool at the west London club. A fire crew and paramedics tried to revive the Imperial College graduate for almost an hour before she was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Westminster coroner's court heard that staff at the club administered CPR incorrectly and falsified paperwork relating to CCTV checks to pretend that they had been monitoring the pool in a ‚Äúdistasteful‚Äù attempt to cover their tracks. Firemen also described how a man, who said he was a member of staff, had stood by filming efforts to resuscitate Carneau on his mobile telephone. Pierre Carneau, the victim's father criticised Virgin active for not apologising for the accident. He stated \\"It was an accident waiting to happen. If things had been done properly, I think there‚Äôs a chance our daughter may still be alive.‚Äù Virgin Active admitted health and safety breaches and was fined ¬£100,000 at Southwark Crown Court in December 2013. An investigation found ‚Äúserious shortcomings in the management of risks connected with swimming activity at the club‚Äù going back to 2009. In April 2014, three gym goers were injured when a suspended ceiling collapsed on to a line of rowing machines at the Virgin Active on Chiswick High Road, in West London.

An independent film, it won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival and launched the careers of Solondz and Heather Matarazzo. The story follows the unpopular middle schooler Dawn as she goes to extreme lengths trying to earn the respect of her vicious fellow students and her disinterested family. Dawn reappears in two of Solondz's other films, Palindromes and Wiener-Dog. Plot Eleven-and-a-half- year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy, unattractive, unpopular seventh-grader living in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey. Her older brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Her younger sister Missy is spoiled and manipulative; she pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Her mother Marj is a shrewish woman who dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Her father Harv is a meek man who sides with Marj over Dawn. Her only friend is an effeminate sixth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. At home, Marj punishes her for calling Missy a \\"lesbo\\" and refusing to apologize. Her teacher unfairly keeps her after school after one of her bullies Brandon McCarthy tries to copy her answers on a test. Later, Dawn gets in trouble again after accidentally hitting another teacher in the eye with a spitball in self-defense when Brandon and his friends bully her during an assembly. Mark's classmate Steve Rodgers, a handsome and charismatic aspiring rock musician, agrees to join the band in exchange for Mark's help in school. Dawn pursues him romantically when they spend time together, though one of Steve's former girlfriends tells her that she has no chance of being with him. After Dawn calls Brandon a \\"retard\\" during a confrontation, he threatens her with rape. His first attempt to assault her after school fails, but shortly afterward, he phones her, ordering her to meet him again the next day. When she complies, he takes her to a junkyard, where he starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her instead. At dinner that evening, when she refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for her parents' 20th anniversary party, Marj has Mark and Missy destroy it and gives them Dawn's share of dessert. Dawn and Brandon spend time in her clubhouse, but she confesses to him her feelings for Steve, causing him to storm out. Ralphy, who was spying on them, tries to comfort Dawn, but she angrily rejects him when he insults Brandon, leaving her with no friends. At the anniversary party, Dawn intends to proposition Steve, but gets cold feet and is rebuffed. Steve plays with Missy, who pushes Dawn into a kiddie pool. That evening, the family watches a videotape of the party, laughing when Dawn falls into the water. Later, Dawn smashes the tape and briefly brandishes her hammer over Missy as she sleeps. A few days later, Brandon is arrested and expelled from school for suspected drug dealing. Meanwhile, Harv's car breaks down and Marj has to pick him up. She instructs Dawn to tell Missy to get a ride home with her ballet teacher, but she chooses not to after arguing with Missy, who is kidnapped as a result. Dawn visits Brandon's home and meets his mentally challenged brother and aggressive father. She tells Brandon that she wants to be his girlfriend, but he tells her that he is running away to New York City to avoid being sent to a reformatory. After they kiss, an argument about him dealing drugs ensues, with him saying that one of his friends is the real culprit. Regardless, he asks Dawn if she will come with him, but she declines and he leaves through his bedroom window. When Marj is informed that Missy's tutu was found in Times Square, Dawn goes to New York City to look for her. After a night of searching, she phones home and Mark tells her that Missy was found alive and unharmed by police after being abducted by a pedophilic neighbor. Dawn returns to town and her classmates ridicule her as she delivers a thank-you speech. Mark later tells her that she cannot expect school life to get any better until high school. On a bus ride to Walt Disney World for a concert tour, Dawn sits among her fellow choir members and joins them in singing the school anthem. CastReception The film was a surprise success, considering it was a relatively low budget, independently produced film. It garnered critical praise for its nail-biting view of a pre-teen outcast, and won the Grand Jury Prize for best dramatic feature at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. Critic Roger Ebert was vocal about his love for the film, giving it four stars out of four and placing it at No. 5 on his \\"Best of 1996\\" list. The film currently holds a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An outstanding sophomore feature, Welcome to the Dollhouse sees writer-director Todd Solondz mining suburban teen angst for black, biting comedy.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

It is the language of Koba√Øa, a fictional planet invented by Vander and the setting for a musical \\"space opera\\" sung in Koba√Øan by Magma on ten concept albums. Development French drummer and composer Christian Vander formed progressive rock band Magma in late 1969 in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of American jazz musician and composer John Coltrane. Magma's first album, Magma (later reissued as Koba√Øa), told a story of refugees fleeing a future Earth and settling on a fictional planet called Koba√Øa. The lyrics were all in Koba√Øan (except the title track, sung mostly in English), a language Vander constructed for the album, some sung by soloists and others by \\"massive quasi- operatic choruses\\". Over the next three decades Magma made a further nine albums that continued the mythology of Koba√Øa, all sung in Koba√Øan. Vander (his Koba√Øan name is Z√´b√´hn Stra√Øn d√´ ƒûeu≈°taah) said in an interview that he invented Koba√Øan for Magma because \\"French just wasn't expressive enough. Either for the story or for the sound of the music\\". He said that the language developed in parallel with the music, that sounds appeared as he was composing on a piano. Vander based Koba√Øan in part on elements of Slavic and Germanic languages and in part on the scat-yodeling vocal style of American avant garde jazz singer Leon Thomas. The subsequent expansion of the language became a group effort, and as Magma's personnel changed, so new ideas were incorporated into the language (and the music). British music critic Ian MacDonald said that Koba√Øan is \\"phonetic, not semantic\\", and that it is based on \\"sonorities, not on applied meanings\\". One of Magma's singers, Klaus Blasquiz, described Koba√Øan as \\"a language of the heart\\" whose words are \\"inseparable from the music\\". Magma expert Michael Draine said \\"the abstraction provided by the Koba√Øan verse seems to inspire Magma's singers to heights of emotional abandon rarely permitted by conventional lyrics\\". The Koba√Øan lyrics on Magma's albums were generally not translated (though both Koba√Øan lyrics and an English translation were provided for the first UK release on A&M; of M√´kan√Øk D√´strukt√Ø·∫Å K√∂mmand√∂h), but clues to the unfolding story of Koba√Øa were given in French in the albums' liner notes. While the original intent of the language was to avoid over-scrutiny, unofficial Koba√Øan online lexicons were created by Magma fans, and Vander himself has since translated many of the words. Influence Christian Vander called Magma's music \\"Zeuhl\\" (Koba√Øan for \\"celestial\\"), and it influenced a number of other (mostly French) bands, including Zao (France), Art Zoyd (France) and Univers Zero (Belgium). Zeuhl later became a music genre which was used to describe music similar to that of Magma. Several Japanese Zeuhl bands also sprang up, including Ruins and K≈çenji Hyakkei, whose lyrics are also sung in a constructed language similar to Koba√Øan.

Guns. Recorded at Hollywood studios One on One, Music Grinder and Conway Recording, it was produced by Duane Baron, John Purdell and Tom Werman, and released on August 22, 1989 by Vertigo Records. The album is the first to feature drummer Steve Riley. \\"Rip and Tear\\", \\"Never Enough\\", \\"The Ballad of Jayne\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" and \\"Malaria\\" were released as the album's singles. Following the success of their self-titled debut album the previous year, L.A. Guns quickly set about recording the follow-up in 1989. Writing for all tracks were credited to all five members of the band, while \\"Never Enough\\" was co-written by Gregg Tripp and Phil Roy. Four tracks were re-recorded by the reunited classic lineup of the band in 1999 for the compilation Greatest Hits and Black Beauties, and the whole album was re-recorded for the release Cocked & Re-Loaded. Upon its release, Cocked & Loaded peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1990. Both \\"Rip and Tear\\" and \\"The Ballad of Jayne\\" reached the top 50 of the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, while the latter registered at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. Media response to the album was positive, with critics praising the band's development of their sound from their debut album the previous year. Background L.A. Guns recorded the follow-up to their 1988 self-titled debut album early the following year, working with producers Duane Baron, John Purdell and Tom Werman. Sessions took place at three Hollywood studios, One on One Studios, Music Grinder and Conway Recording. The album was the band's first to feature drummer Steve Riley, who took over from his predecessor Nickey \\"Beat\\" Alexander after the recording for L.A. Guns was completed. Five singles were released in promotion of the album, two of which charted in the US ‚Äì \\"The Ballad of Jayne\\" reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 25 on the Mainstream Rock chart, while \\"Rip and Tear\\" reached number 47 on the latter chart. Music videos for all five tracks were featured on the 1990 video Love, Peace & Geese. Reception Upon its release, Cocked & Loaded debuted at number 89 on the US Billboard 200. It spent a total of 56 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 38 in July 1990. In the same month, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for domestic sales in excess of 500,000 certified units. Outside of the US, the album reached number 23 on the Japanese Albums Chart, and number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. Media response to Cocked & Loaded was generally positive. Cash Box magazine claimed that the band had \\"grown by leaps and bounds\\" since the release of their self-titled debut the previous year, praising the performance of lead guitarist Tracii Guns in particular. Billboard magazine's review was more mixed, as they described the album as \\"a spotty affair\\" and added that the band \\"has a sound that verges on the metal generic at times, but when the members click ... they can run with the best of the pack\\". The opinion of Los Angeles Times writer Janiss Garza was similar, who claimed that \\"The L.A.-based quintet's blatant disregard for subtlety works, as long as you don't think too deeply\\" and praised \\"Magdalaine\\" and \\"Give a Little\\" in particular as \\"a few interesting turns\\". Retrospectively, the album has received widespread critical acclaim. Steve Huey of music website AllMusic dubbed it \\"L.A. Guns' most consistent and effective album\\", claiming that it \\"manages to balance the underlying darkness of Guns N' Roses' urban outlook with M√∂tley Cr√ºe's party-anthem glam metal\\". In particular, Huey praised the songwriting as \\"among [the band's] best\\", highlighting the tracks \\"Never Enough\\" and \\"The Ballad of Jayne\\". Rolling Stone magazine named Cocked & Loaded the 27th best \\"hair metal\\" album of all-time, praising the variety of material on the release including \\"bullet-belt bravado\\" on \\"Rip and Tear\\", \\"17 Crash\\" and \\"Give a Little\\", the \\"hard-living knowledge\\" on display on \\"Sleazy Come Easy Go\\", and the \\"proggier side\\" shown on \\"Magdalaine\\" and \\"Malaria\\".

Catecahassa or Black Hoof (c. 1740-1831) was the head civil chief of the Shawnee Indians in the Ohio Country of what became the United States. A member of the Mekoche division of the Shawnees, Black Hoof became known as a fierce warrior during the early wars between the Shawnee and Anglo- American colonists. Black Hoof claimed to have been present at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755, when General Edward Braddock was defeated during the French and Indian War, although there is no contemporary evidence that Shawnees took part in that battle. Little documentary evidence of Black Hoof's life appears in the historical record before 1795. As a child he may have been a member of a wandering band of some 400 Shawnees led by Peter Chartier between 1745 and 1748, who founded the community in Kentucky called Eskippakithiki and later moved to Sylacauga, Alabama, eventually settling in Old Shawneetown, Illinois.\\"Hanna on Peter Charter\\", E.P. Grondine, posted Thu Feb 14, 2013. He probably took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant during Lord Dunmore's War against the Virginia militia in 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, he may have taken part in the siege of Boonesborough in 1778, which was led by Chief Blackfish, as well as the subsequent defense of the Shawnee village of Chillicothe in 1779. In the Northwest Indian War, Black Hoof was defeated by \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne and, following the collapse of the Indian confederation, surrendered in 1795. Like Little Turtle of the Miamis, Black Hoof decided that American Indians needed to adapt culturally to the ways of the whites in order to prevent decimation through warfare. During his later years, Black Hoof became an ally of the United States and was responsible for keeping the majority of the Shawnee nation from joining \\"Tecumseh's War\\", which became part of the War of 1812. Black Hoof resisted the policy of Indian removal that the United States implemented soon after the War of 1812. He never signed a removal treaty, and continued to lead his tribe until his death in Saint Johns, Ohio in 1831. After his death, the Shawnee were eventually compelled to emigrate to the West.

This second group further divides into conditions caused by exposure to ambient pressures significantly different from surface atmospheric pressure, and a range of conditions caused by general environment and equipment associated with diving activities. Disorders particularly associated with diving include those caused by variations in ambient pressure, such as barotraumas of descent and ascent, decompression sickness and those caused by exposure to elevated ambient pressure, such as some types of gas toxicity. There are also non- dysbaric disorders associated with diving, which include the effects of the aquatic environment, such as drowning, which also are common to other water users, and disorders caused by the equipment or associated factors, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide poisoning. General environmental conditions can lead to another group of disorders, which include hypothermia and motion sickness, injuries by marine and aquatic organisms, contaminated waters, man- made hazards, and ergonomic problems with equipment. Finally there are pre- existing medical and psychological conditions which increase the risk of being affected by a diving disorder, which may be aggravated by adverse side effects of medications and other drug use. Treatment depends on the specific disorder, but often includes oxygen therapy, which is standard first aid for most diving accidents, and is hardly ever contra-indicated for a person medically fit to dive, and hyperbaric therapy is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness. Screening for medical fitness to dive can reduce some of the risk for some of the disorders.  Effects of variation in ambient pressure  Mask squeeze barotrauma of descent Many diving accidents or illnesses are related to the effect of pressure on gases in the body; =Barotrauma= Barotrauma is physical injury to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside or in contact with the body, and the surroundings. Barotrauma occurs when the difference in pressure between the surroundings and the gas space makes the gas expand in volume, distorting adjacent tissues enough to rupture cells or damage tissue by deformation. A special case, where pressure in tissue is reduced to the level that causes dissolved gas to come out of solution as bubbles, is called decompression sickness, the bends, or caisson disease. Several organs are susceptible to barotrauma, however the cause is well understood and procedures for avoidance are clear. Nevertheless, barotrauma occurs and can be life-threatening, and procedures for first aid and further treatment are an important part of diving medicine. Barodontalgia *Barotraumas of descent (squeezes) **Ear squeeze (also alternobaric vertigo) **Sinus squeeze (aerosinusitis) **Tooth squeeze (dental barotrauma, barodontalgia) **Mask squeeze **Helmet squeeze **Suit squeeze *Barotraumas of ascent (overexpansion injuries) **Lung overexpansion injury (pulmonary barotrauma) ‚Äì rupture of lung tissue allowing air to enter tissues, blood vessels, or spaces between or surrounding organs: ***Pneumothorax: Free air in the pleural cavity, leading to collapsed lung. ***Interstitial emphysema: Gas trapped in the spaces between tissues. ***Mediastinal emphysema: Gas trapped around the heart. ***Subcutaneous emphysema: Free gas under the skin. **Arterial gas embolism: Air or other breathing gas in the blood stream, causing blockage of small blood vessels. **Intestinal gas overexpansion **Middle ear overpressure (reversed ear) (also alternobaric vertigo) **Sinus overpressure (aerosinusitis) **Tooth overpressure (dental barotrauma, barodontalgia) =Compression arthralgiaDecompression sicknessDysbaric osteonecrosisHigh pressure nervous syndromeNitrogen narcosisOxygen toxicity= Non-dysbaric disorders associated with diving =DrowningSalt water aspiration syndromeHypoxiaSwimming induced pulmonary edemaImmersion diuresisHypercapniaCarbon monoxide poisoningLipid pneumonia Environmental hazards = Hazards in the underwater environment that can affect divers include marine life, marine infections, polluted water, ocean currents, waves and surges and man-made hazards such as boats, fishing lines and underwater construction. Diving medical personnel need to be able to recognize and treat accidents from large and small predators and poisonous creatures, appropriately diagnose and treat marine infections and illnesses from pollution as well as diverse maladies such as sea sickness, traveler's diarrhea and malaria. HypothermiaNon-freezing cold injuriesFrostbiteHyperthermiaSeasickness=CrampsInjury caused by marine animals=EnvenomationBitesBlunt trauma= Contamination from polluted waters = In most places, contamination comes from a variety of sources (non-point source pollution). In a few it is primarily pollution from a single industrial source. The more immediate threat is from locations where high concentrations of toxic or pathogenic pollutants are present, but lower concentrations of less immediately harmful contaminants can have a longer term influence on the diver's health. Three major categories of contamination can cause health and safety problems for divers. These are biological, chemical and radioactive materials. The risks from hazardous materials are generally proportional to dosage - exposure time and concentration, and the effects of the material on the body. This is particularly the case with chemical and radiological contaminants. There may be a threshold limit value which will not usually produce ill effects over long term exposure. Others may have a cumulative effect. The United Nations identification numbers for hazardous materials classifies hazardous materials under 9 categories: # Explosives # Gases, which may be compressed, liquified or dissolved under pressure # Flammable liquids # Flammable solids # Oxidising agents # Poisonous and infectious substances # Radioactive substances # Corrosive substances # Miscellaneous hazardous substances A contaminant may be classed under one or more of these categories. Poisonous substances are also classified in 9 categories: # Irritants # Simple asphyxiants # Blood asphyxiants # Tissue asphyxiants # Respiratory paralysers # Liver and kidney toxins # Substances that affect the muscles (myotoxins) # Substances that affect bone marrow # Substances tha interfere with nerve function (neurotoxins) = Trauma due to the natural physical environment  Injuries caused by man-made hazards  Disorders caused by the diving equipment = A variety of disorders may be caused by ergonomic problems due to poorly fitting equipment. *Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is pain or tenderness in the jaw, headache or facial ache caused by gripping the regulator mouthpiece between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws. This action is required to retain the mouthpiece in place for the duration of the dive, and may strain the masticatory muscles or the temporomandibular joint, which is where the lower jawbone (mandible) hinges on the skull at the temporal bone. This problem van be aggravated by cold water, stress, and strong water movement, and can be reduced by use of custom mouthpieces with longer and more rigid bite grip surfaces, which allow better support of the second stage with less effort. *Leg and foot cramps may be caused by unaccustomed exercise, cold, or ill-fitting fins. *Lower back pain may be caused by a heavy weightbelt hanging from the small of the back, counteracting the buoyancy of the diving suit which is distributed over the full length of the diver. This effect can be reduced by use of integrated weight systems which support the weights over the length of the back on the diving harness backplate. *Restricted circulation to the hands may be caused by excessively tight dry suit cuff seals.  Treatment  Decompression chamber Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), which is the definitive treatment for most incidences of decompression illness. Hyperbaric treatment on other breathing gases is also used for treatment of decompression sickness if HBO is inadequate. = Oxygen therapy = The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer-term treatment. = Hyperbaric therapy = Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. Now, it is a highly specialized treatment modality that has been found to be effective in the treatment of many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure has been found to be beneficial. Studies have shown it to be quite effective in some 13 indications approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, However, in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues that cause the symptoms.  Fitness to dive  Hand held spirometer with display and transducer All divers should be free of conditions and illnesses that would negatively impact their safety and well-being underwater. The diving medical physician should be able to identify, treat and advise divers about illnesses and conditions that would cause them to be at increased risk for a diving accident. Some reasons why a person should not be allowed to dive are as follows: *Disorders that lead to altered consciousness: conditions that produce reduced awareness or sedation from medication, drugs, marijuana or alcohol; fainting, heart problems and seizure activity. *Disorders that substantially increase the risk of barotrauma injury conditions or diseases that are associated with air trapping in closed spaces, such as sinuses, middle ear, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Severe asthma is an example. *Disorders that may lead to erratic and irresponsible behavior: included here would be immaturity, psychiatric disorders, diving while under the influence of medications, drugs and alcohol or any medical disorder that results in cognitive defects. Conditions that may increase risk of diving disorders: *Patent foramen ovale *Diabetes mellitus ‚Äî No serious problems should be expected during dives due to hypoglycaemia in divers with well-controlled diabetes. Long-term complications of diabetes should be considered and may be a contrindication. *Asthma Conditions considered temporary reasons to suspend diving activities: *Pregnancy‚ÄîIt is unlikely that literature research can establish the effect of scuba diving on the unborn human fetus as there is insufficient data, and women tend to comply with the diving industry recommendation not to dive while pregnant.

Situated approximately 550 km west of Sydney and 450 km north of Melbourne in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, it is the administrative centre of the Leeton Shire Council local government area. Leeton's urban population in 2016 was 8,623. Situated in one of the most productive farming regions in the state, the town was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and purpose-built for the irrigation schemes announced by the New South Wales government in the early 1900s. Citrus, rice, cotton, grapes, walnuts and wheat farms can all be found throughout the Leeton Shire. Leeton is renowned as Australia's Rice Capital and as The Heart of SunRice Country, as it is home to the SunRice headquarters. Other industry includes Freedom Foods, the Daily Drinks Co., JBS Australia, Webster Limited (walnuts and cotton) and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Limited. History Burley Griffin Water Towers Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. The town is named after Charles Alfred Lee, a Minister for Public Works in New South Wales from 1904 to 1910.Leeton Tourism: Charles Alfred Lee , accessed 22 February 2011. Single Burley Griffin Water Tower in 1912/1913 In 1912 a water tower was built to supply water to the then tent town. Leeton Post Office opened on 6 September 1912. In 1913 when the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales was formed Leeton was only a canvas town, the only houses being those built on farms by settlers and houses for its officers by the Commission. On 3 April 1913 the first block of land was sold in the town. During 1913 a kurrajong tree which became known as the Pioneers' Tree, was planted as a feature in Kurrajong Avenue, and a butter factory was established in the town. In 1914 World War I broke out; of the town's population of 2000 people, 200 men were serving in the armed forces making it difficult to maintain the plantings in the irrigation area. During 1914 and 1915 an abattoir and canning factory were established in the town. In August 1913 Walter Burley Griffin visited the town to complete its design. Historic Hydro Hotel In 1919 the Hydro Hotel was constructed for Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission executives to stay whilst in Leeton but was not licensed to sell alcohol until 1924 when the alcohol prohibition in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area was lifted. During 1920 the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales began to pressure the Government for relief for being responsible for providing civic and local government services with the Commission stating \\"revenue which comes mainly from rents and water charges, having remained unchanged, is insufficient to cover the cost of local government services now that the weekly wage is more than double the figure paid when the settlement started\\". The Commission chose and appointed an Advisory Board which was made up of pioneer farmers which already had been in operation in the Yanco area since 1913. In June 1925 the Commission released its annual report stating that a Royal Commission recommended setting up of local government bodies within the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area but no date had been decided. On 1 January 1928 the Willimbong Shire was formed with the name \\"Willimbong\\" being retained until 19 July 1946 when it was renamed as Leeton Shire. Roxy Theatre In 1929 the Roxy Theatre was built on a large vacant block of land on the corner of Wade and Pine Avenue and was completed and opened in April 1930. In 1930 Willimbong Shire become the trustee of the Leeton Racecourse, established in 1912, when the land was gazetted as a reserve for racing, public recreation and aviation. In August 1931 Southern Cross became the first aircraft to officially landing at the aerodrome. During 1935 work was done at the aerodrome for it to be licensed to take aircraft including commercial aircraft. In August 1935 Western and Southern Provincial (W.A.S.P.) Airlines commenced an air service between Leeton and Sydney however the service was ended in 1936 when a Tugan Gannet aircraft used by W.A.S.P. Airlines crashed on 26 February 1936 in the Cordeaux Dam area. In July 1938 it was proposed to the Willimbong Shire by the Civil Aviation Board that an area around Fivebough could be developed into an aerodrome since the Leeton Aerodrome at the race course was too small and could only operate on a restricted licence. Willimbong Shire agreed to lease the land with preliminary work carried out on the site however the aerodrome was never used by any commercial airline. During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force established a training school in the nearby town of Narrandera which was a large aerodrome. After this a report from the Department of Civil Aviation stated that Fivebough was eminently suitable as an aerodrome but strongly recommended that they should consider jointly operating the aerodrome with Narrandera Shire. During the early part of the 1930s Willimbong Shire took over the town water supply when it also became apparent that the town needed a second water tower which was constructed next to the first tower with the construction completed on 27 March 1937. Leeton & District Memorial Swimming Pool The Swimming baths in Leeton was constructed by voluntary labour in 1931 and was completed on 24 February 1932. The Leeton Swimming Club made a request that the swimming baths be replaced by a modern swimming complex. In 1959 money was raised though the Irrigana Festival, which was a biennial festival in the town, with the Leeton Shire obtaining a loan with construction starting on the complex. On 17 November 1962 the Leeton & District Memorial Swimming Pool was opened. Rice growing became a major industry during World War II under Government promotion to help supply food for troops. A number of local farmers, some such as teenager Norm Houghton, pioneered the planting of new varieties to suit the local conditions.Peter Lalor, 'Rice growers resent water-wasting image', The Australian, 11 Nov 2006 (registration required) The Irrigana Festival began in 1959 as a biennial festival but was short lived due to it lacking strong publicity value even though the festival was successful with fund raising. The name \\"Irrigana\\" was chosen from a competition in the Murrumbidgee Irrigator, In 1970 a biennial festival returned in the town known as the \\"Rice Bowl Festival\\". By 1988 the festival was renamed to \\"Sunwhite Rice Festival\\" with sponsorship from the Ricegrowers Co-Operative Limited. =Heritage listings= Leeton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hydro Hotel * Koonadan Historic Site * Leeton District Lands Office * Leeton District Office artefacts * Leeton railway station * Roxy Community Theatre  Education  War memorial Leeton is the second largest educational centre in the Riverina after Wagga Wagga.

In Suriname he was arrested, and the protest against his arrest resulted in two deaths. De Kom was subsequently exiled to the Netherlands where he wrote Wij slaven van Suriname (\\"We Slaves of Surinam\\"), a classic anti-colonial book. During World War II, he joined the resistance, was arrested, and sent to concentration camps where he died. Biography Statue of Anton de Kom De Kom was born in Paramaribo, Suriname, to farmer Adolf de Kom and Judith Jacoba Dulder. His father was born a slave. De Kom finished primary and secondary school and obtained a diploma in bookkeeping. He worked for the Balata Compagnie√´n Suriname en Guyana. On 29 July 1920 he resigned and left for Haiti where he worked for the Societ√© Commerciale Hollandaise Transatlantique. In 1921, he left for the Netherlands. He volunteered for the Huzaren (a Dutch cavalry regiment) for a year. In 1922 he started working for a consultancy in The Hague. One year later he was laid off due to a reorganization. He then became a sales representative selling coffee, tea and tobacco for a company in The Hague, where he met his future wife, Nel. In addition to his work, he was active in numerous left-wing organizations, including nationalist Indonesian student organisations and (Aim Left), and wrote for communist magazines like De Tribune. Often using the pseudonyms Adek or Adekom. In 1929, de Kom was a speaker at the 18th Party Congress of the Communist Party Holland where he emphasised that the people of Suriname live in poverty without rights, and to his delight a resolution passed to change the slogan to \\"Indonesia, Suriname and Cura√ßao, immediate and full independence from the Netherlands\\" De Kom and his family left for Suriname on 20 December 1932 and arrived on 4 January 1933. From that moment on he was closely watched by the colonial authorities. He started a consultancy in his parents' house. Large groups used to gather around the house, because de Kom was helping Javanese and Indians with their re-emigration. Weapons were offered to de Kom for protection, but he refused to take up arms, because he did not want a bloodbath. On 1 February he was arrested while en route to the governor's office with a large group of followers. On both 3 and 4 February his followers gathered in front of the Attorney General's office to demand De Kom's release. On 7 February a large crowd gathered on the Oranjeplein (currently called the Onafhankelijkheidsplein). Rumor had it that De Kom was about to be released. When the crowd refused to leave the square, police opened fire, killing two people and wounding 22. On 10 May De Kom was sent to the Netherlands without trial and exiled from his native country. De Kom was inspired by Albert Helman's Zuid-Zuid-West (1926) which ended with a fierce anti-colonial epilogue. He was unemployed and decided to write his own book about the history of Suriname and slavery called, Wij slaven van Suriname (We Slaves of Suriname) which was published in a censored form in 1934. De Kom participated in demonstrations for the unemployed, traveled abroad with a group as a tap dancer, and was drafted for Werkverschaffing (unemployment relief work), a program similar to the American WPA, in 1939. He gave lectures for leftist groups, mainly communists, about colonialism and racial discrimination. After the German invasion in 1940, his writings were banned. De Kom joined the Dutch resistance, especially the communist party in The Hague. He wrote articles for the underground paper De Vonk of the communist party, mainly about the terror of fascist groups in the streets of The Hague (much of their terror was directed against Jews). On 7 August 1944, he was arrested. He was imprisoned at the Oranjehotel in Scheveningen, and transferred to Camp Vught, a Dutch concentration camp. In early September 1944, he was sent to Oranienburg- Sachsenhausen, where he was forced to work for the Heinkel aircraft factory. De Kom died on 24 April 1945 of tuberculosis in Camp Sandbostel near Bremerv√∂rde (between Bremen and Hamburg), which was a satellite camp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. He was buried in a mass grave. In 1960, his remains were found and brought to the Netherlands. There he was buried at the National Cemetery of Honours in Loenen. Family De Kom was married to a Dutch woman, Petronella Borsboom. They had four children. Their son, Cees de Kom, lives in Suriname. His grandson Antoine de Kom is a Dutch writer and poet. Aftermath Part of his unpublished novel Ons bloed is rood (Our blood is red) appeared in Adek (1983). In 1988, the Surinamese Worker and Unemployed Organisation (SAWO) submitted a motion with the municipality of Amsterdam to name a square after Anton de Kom. A square in Amsterdam-Zuidoost near the shopping centre was renamed Anton de Komplein. The square features a sculpture of Anton de Kom as a monument to his life and works, sculpted by Jikke van Loon. SAWO went on to petition the Government for rehabilitation. In 2008, Vereniging Ons Suriname rediscovered manuscripts which were lost in the 1960s. The manuscripts contained the movie scenario Tjiboe, parts of the novels Ons bloed is rood and Om een hap rijst (For a bit of rice), and several Anansi- stories, a spider who represents skill and wisdom in folktales of the Akan people. The archives were presented to Michiel van Kempen by Anton de Kom's children Ad and Judith de Kom, and are on display at the Literature Museum. In 1981, the Pontewerfstraat in Frimangron, Paramaribo was renamed to Anton de Komstraat. On 17 October 1983, the University of Suriname was renamed the Anton de Kom University of Suriname in honor of De Kom. In 2007, the LBR Lecture, an annual lecture against racism and discrimination organised by the Resistance Museum, was renamed Anton de Kom Lecture. A documentary film about him, Peace, Memories of Anton de Kom, by filmmaker Ida Does, was produced in 2012. In 2020, de Kom was added as a subject on the Canon of Dutch History. De Kom is the first Surinamese citizen to be added to the 50 vital subjects to be taught in school in the Netherlands. Ingrid van Engelshoven, Dutch Minister of Education, stressed that the shadow sides of society needed to be addressed as well. A film about Anton Kom is in the making as of 2020.

The extension of equal political rights has been accompanied by a conscious drive to promote women to positions of authority within government.  Political participation  The move to give women the vote in 2002 was part of several wide-ranging political reforms that have seen the establishment of a democratically elected parliament and the release of political prisoners. Before 2002, women had no political rights and could neither vote in elections nor stand as candidates. There was, however, some ambivalence towards the extension of political rights from sections of Bahraini society, not least from women themselves, with 60% of Bahraini women in 2001 opposing extending the vote to women. Although many women stood as candidates in both municipal and parliamentary elections in 2002, none were elected to office. There were no women candidates in the lists of Islamist parties such as Al Wefaq, Al-Menbar Islamic Society and Asalah. Following the poor performance of women candidates in the parliamentary elections, six women, including one Christian, were appointed to the upper chamber of parliament, the Shura Council. In 2004, Bahrain appointed its first female minister, Dr Nada Haffadh to the position of Health Minister, and in 2005, Dr Fatima Albalooshi, the second woman minister was appointed to the cabinet. In 2005, Houda Ezra Nonoo, a Jewish activist, who since 2004 also headed the Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society which has campaigned against the reintroduction of the death penalty in Bahrain, was also appointed to the Shura Council. In April 2005, Shura member Alees Samaan became the first woman to chair a parliamentary session in the Arab world when she chaired the Shura Council. The head of the main women's organisation, the Supreme Council for Women, Ms Lulwa Al Awadhi, has been given the title of 'honorary cabinet minister'. In June 2006, Bahrain was elected head of the United Nations General Assembly, and appointed Haya Rashid Al Khalifa as the Assembly's President, making her the first Middle Eastern woman and the third woman in history to take over the post. Sheikha Haya is a leading Bahraini lawyer and women's rights advocate who will take over the post at a time of change for the world body. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said of her, \\"I met her yesterday and I found her quite impressive. All the member states are determined to work with her and to support her, and I think she's going to bring a new dimension to the work here.\\" Several women's rights activists have become political personalities in Bahrain in their own right, or even gained international recognition, such as Ghada Jamsheer, who was named by Forbes magazine as one of the \\" ten most powerful and effective women in the Arab world\\" in May 2006. Ghada Jamsheer, the most prominent women's rights activist in BahrainGhada Jamsheer, Time magazine, May 14, 2006 has called the government's reforms \\"artificial and marginal\\". In a statement in December 2006 she said: Bahrain's move was widely considered to have encouraged women's rights activists in the rest of the Persian Gulf to step up demands for equality. In 2005, it was announced that Kuwaiti women would be granted equal political rights to men. =2006 Election= Eighteen female candidates stood at the 2006 Bahraini general election. Most of the female candidates ran for Leftist parties or as independents, with no Islamist party being represented by a woman, although salafist party Asalah was the only group to publicly oppose female candidature in parliamentary elections. Only one candidate, Lateefa Al Gaood, won; in her case by default before polling after her two opponents in her constituency dropped out of the race. Personal status law There is no unified personal status law in Bahrain that covers matters such as divorce and child custody, so that Sharia judges have discretion in such matters. In November 2005, the Supreme Council for Women in an alliance with other women's rights activists, began a campaign for change - organising demonstrations, putting up posters across the island and carrying out a series of media interviews.see Supreme Council's website for full details in Arabic However, changing the law has been resisted by the leading Shia Islamist party, Al Wefaq, resulting in a major political showdown with women's rights activists. Al Wefaq argued that neither Chamber of Deputies elected MPs nor the government have the authority to change the law because these institutions could 'misinterpret the word of God'. Instead, the right to change the law is the sole responsibility of religious leaders. On 9 November 2005, supporters of Al Wefaq claimed to have organised Bahrain's largest ever demonstration with 120,000 protesting against the introduction of the Personal Status Law, and for the maintenance of each religious group having their own divorce and inheritance laws. On the same day, an alliance of women's rights organisations held a smaller rally calling for the unified law, which attracted 500 supporters. The issue of the introduction of a unified personal status law has divided civil society into two camps, with women's rights and human rights groups wanting its introduction, opposed by Shia Islamist groups in alliance with the wahabbi Asalah: For: * Supreme Council for Women * Bahrain Human Rights Society * Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society * Bahrain Women's Union * Women's Petition * Bahrain Young Ladies Association * National Democratic Action * Al Sharaka (Bahrain branch of Amnesty International) * Bahrain Centre for Human Rights Against: * Al Wefaq * Asalah * Islamic Action Party * Islamic Awareness Society * Capital Transparency Society See also *Be-Free *Women in Bahrain *Munira Fakhro *Sawsan Taqawi General: *Human rights in Bahrain *Women in Arab societies *Women in Islam ReferencesExternal links *A guide to Bahrain, Your complete guide to Bahrain, April 2006 *New Dawn for Bahraini Women, Amnesty International, March 2002 *Lifting the veil for women in politics, Gulf Daily News, 6 August 2005 *In the Gulf, women are not women's best friends, Daily Star, 20 June 2005 *Personal law plan rapped, Gulf Daily News, 3 November 2005 *Demonstration against family law reform, AKI, 5 November 2005 *Law rivals in show of strength, Gulf Daily News, 10 November 2005 * Bahraini woman chairs parliament BBC, 19 April 2005 * Women warned of 'dirty' poll fight, Gulf Daily News, 13 October 2005 * 'Clerics biggest obstacle to women's rights in Bahrain' Kuwait Times, 1 April 2006 * Bahrain's first woman diplomat to lead UN assembly Stuff (New Zealand) 6 June 2006 * Societies slammed for not backing women Gulf News 15 June 2006 * 'Achieving prominent positions is a familiar occurrence' Gulf News 27 June 2006 * First female judge * 'Ghada Jamsheer to UN: are royal reforms for women just token gestures?' * 'Give women a chance to prove mettle' by Sara Horton.

Built by Carrington Slipways and launched in 1989, the vessel is owned by P&O; Maritime Services, but is regularly chartered by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) for research cruises in Antarctic waters and to support Australian bases in Antarctica. Currently it is the only Australian-built and operated icebreaker ship. Design and construction Designed as a multi-purpose research and resupply ship, Aurora Australis was built by Carrington Slipways in Tomago, New South Wales. The vessel was launched in September 1989. Aurora Australis berthed in Hobart under a rainbow, with the French research vessel L'Astrolabe to the right. Aurora Australis is long, and has a beam of , draught of and moulded depth of . Her displacement is 8,158 tons, gross tonnage 6,574 and deadweight tonnage 3,911 tons. Her propulsion machinery consists of two W√§rtsil√§ medium-speed diesel engines in father-son arrangement, one 16-cylinder 16V32D producing 5,500 kW and one 12-cylinder 12V32D producing 4,500 kW. Both engines are coupled to a single shaft through a reduction gear, driving a single, left-hand-turning controllable-pitch propeller. Slow speed manoeuvring is achieved with three manoeuvring thrusters, one forward and two aft. Aurora Australis has a maximum speed of , and a cruising speed of .

MIIU. Retrieved 2 April 2012 Aurora Australis is served by a crew of 24 and carry up to 116 passengers accommodated in three or four-bunk cabins with attached bathrooms. The ship has a cargo capacity of for break bulk or 29 twenty-foot equivalent containers, and a supply tank that can hold of fuel. The ship is fitted with laboratories for biological, meteorological, and oceanographic research, and was designed with a trawl deck for the deployment and recovery of research instruments while at sea. The ship's hangar and helideck allow for the operation of up to three helicopters, usually Eurocopter Squirrels or Sikorsky S-76s. Operations Researchers from Aurora Australis observing a pair of penguins Aurora Australis is chartered by the AAD over the southern summer for research purposes, and to support the Antarctic bases operated by the AAD. The vessel spends most winters in port in Hobart, Tasmania, as the AAD headquarters is in the nearby town of Kingston. P&O; sometimes charter the ship for other work during winter. On 8 May 2011, Aurora Australis was chartered by the Department of Defence for a two-month deployment (ending 30 June) as an amphibious transport ship supporting the Royal Australian Navy. The charter, costing A$3.375 million, was to assist in the Australian government response to humanitarian crises and natural disasters that occurred while the naval heavy lift ship underwent maintenance. In late December 2013, Aurora Australis, Chinese research vessel Xuƒõ L√≥ng and French icebreaker L'Astrolabe attempted to rescue Akademik Shokalskiy, which had become stranded in thick Antarctic ice in Watt Bay. None of the three ships were able to reach the Russian icebreaker, with Aurora Australis aborting efforts on the morning of 30 December, due to the risk of the ship also becoming stuck. On 2 February, the 52 passengers from Akademik Shokalskiy were transported by helicopter to Aurora Australis by Xuƒõ L√≥ngs helicopter (the Chinese icebreaker having become trapped as well). After the rescue, Aurora Australis continued on her original mission to resupply Casey Station, before returning to Hobart on 22 January. The Aurora Australis returned from its final voyage in March 2020. After 31 years of service to the Australian Antarctic Program, the last trip was a two-week voyage to resupply Macquarie Island and transport expeditioners to the south. Suggestions have been made that the ship could be used as an emergency vessel if acquired by the Australian Government. Another possible use that was suggested for the ship was as an Antarctic-themed museum berthed in Hobart. A not-for-profit organisation, the Aurora Australis Foundation, was established to explore this option. However, by June 2020 it looked like the most likely outcome for the Aurora Australis was to be sold to a buyer outside the country.  Engine Room Fire  On 14 January 1999 whilst en route to Antarctica a fire caused by leaking high pressure diesel igniting on the hot STBD main engine caused a major fire. The fire resulted in zero visibility in the engine room and was suppressed by the release of HALON fire suppression system. Re-entry to the compartment resulted in successful restoration of power and propulsion to the ship and it returned to Fremantle under its own power for an investigation by the ATSB and major repairs. Grounding On 24 February 2016, the vessel was damaged when it ran aground in Horseshoe Harbour, near Mawson Station, Antarctica, during a blizzard, after a shackle on a forward mooring line came undone, causing the other three lines to break. It was refloated on 27 February 2016 and returned to Western Australia for repairs. Replacement The predicted end of service life for Aurora Australis, after the most recent round of refits, is May 2017. In late October 2015, the Australian government announced a plan to acquire a new icebreaker to replace Aurora Australis by 2019.

Gepps Cross is traditionally seen as the end of the inner suburbs and the start of the outer northern suburbs, as it was home to a major abattoir (now closed and demolished) with holding yards and other open space. It is the first significant open space encountered after the North Parklands. It retains the open nature, even with warehouses, a velodrome, hockey stadium, Adelaide Raiders ‚Äì a Croatian soccer club and karate training facilities. Gepps Cross is best known for the five-way intersection with Grand Junction Road going east and west, Main North Road south and north-east, and Port Wakefield Road going north. The intersection is not grade-separated. It is controlled by traffic lights, and all five roads have at least three lanes in each direction. These roads include the main highways from Adelaide to Western Australia and the Northern Territory (via Port Wakefield Road), New South Wales (via Main North Road), the northern suburbs of Adelaide and the northern parts of South Australia (both roads). Port Adelaide is to the west, and the major freight hubs are northwest of Gepps Cross. A major route from Port Adelaide towards Victoria and the south and east of South Australia is east along Grand Junction Road then south along Portrush Road to the South Eastern Freeway. It was a holding place for people that came from England in 1952 from there they went interstate to find new homes. Etymology Gepps Cross was named for Isaac Gepp who arrived in South Australia in July 1840 with his wife Ann and son aboard Fairlie. He opened the Gepp's Cross Inn on the southwest corner of the busy intersection of Main North Road and Grand Junction Road in 1848. The earliest known record of Gepp's Cross being apparently accepted into colloquial speech as a location name without reference to the inn, was in April 1849, one year after Isaac Gepp named his 'Gepp's Cross' Inn. In a court case Dr Mayo in evidence referred to the mill at Gepp's Cross and John Harris gave his address as Gepp's Cross.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Wednesday 18 April 1849, page 3 In the same month William Raines, a butcher, baker and storekeeper, advertised he would supply customers at their residences at Gepp's Cross.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Saturday 21 April 1849, page 1 After the names Blair Athol and Enfield were assumed, respectively, for the land on the southwest and southeast of the intersection, the placename Gepps Cross became more heavily associated with land to the north, where the present-day suburb is bounded.

Isaac Gepp, with his wife Ann and a child, had arrived in the province on the Fairlie in July 1840.South Australian Passenger List, Shipping arrivals and Immigration 1803 to 1854, Barry Leadbeater The child passenger was probably his nephew Henry Francis Gepp (1836‚Äì1871), the natural born son of Thomas Gepp (c. 1809‚Äì1894) and Ann Francis (1816‚Äì1868). Gepp first worked as a water carrier and in 1845 he became the publican of the Windmill Inn on Great North Road near Adelaide.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Saturday 12 April 1845, page 1 In May 1846, Gepp gave notice of his application to license a new public house called the Miller's FriendThe South Australian (Adelaide) Tuesday 26 May 1846, page 3 on land being Part Section 360 he had acquired from William Webber the previous year. The name Miller's Friend may be linked to the Ragless flour mill on land, Part Section 97, immediately north east of the junction and Gepp's new premises. Section 360 was originally occupied by James Pitcher about 1842 and he named the land Section Bushy Farm.Enfield and the Northern Villages ‚Äì H John Lewis [1985] , page 158; Adelaide Region, Stuart Nicol 1997, , page 99 About the time Pitcher sold the north eastern corner to Webber, John Merritt, a farmer and copper carrier for the Burra Burra mine, acquired the southern forty acres of Section 360 with a cottage and used it as a residence, to farm and to keep his working bullocks.South Australian Old Systems land dealings Index references :- Part Section 360 Survey B 23/14; 32/14; 30/19 and 260/43 At the time of his licence application for the Miller's Friend, Gepp had contracted to sell his interest in the Windmill Inn to Robert Carter, the licence for which was transferred from Gepp to Carter in June 1846.The South Australian (Adelaide) Tuesday 26 May 1846, page 3 Carter failed to stop Gepp's original application for the new licensed premises on Section 360; he claimed Gepp had contracted with him not to hold another licence in the neighbourhood.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Wednesday 10 June 1846, page 4 In March 1847 Gepp's publican's licence was renewed under the new name of the Miner's Arms.The South Australian (Adelaide) Tuesday 9 March 1847, page 6 Before the licensing bench on 13 March 1848, Isaac Gepp nominated his premises to be the 'Gepp's Cross' Inn.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Wednesday 15 March 1848, page 3 Gepp leased his inn to Joseph Ladd in 1849 who continued to call it the Gepp's Cross Inn.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Saturday 14 April 1849, page3 Charles Matthews owned 13 acres of land, Part of Section 337, across the Main North Road from the Gepp's Cross Inn, on the south eastern corner of Gepp's Cross intersection, where he operated a blacksmith shop.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Wednesday 15 November 1848, page 2 In December 1848 Matthews applied for a publican's licence for the 'Blacksmiths Arms Hotel' on his premises, but Isaac Gepp objected on the grounds that two hotels being placed exactly opposite each other would probably cause the road to be obstructed by drays. The bench ruled that competition for custom would induce a disregard for order or public convenience and the application of Charles Matthews was refused.South Australian Register (Adelaide) Wednesday 13 December 1848, page 3 John Merritt who farmed next to the Gepp's Cross Inn and across the road from Matthew's blacksmith shop took out an option to purchase Matthews' 13-acre property.

Cartwright in 1851, which proposed a theory for the cause of laziness among slaves. Today, dysaesthesia aethiopica is considered an example of pseudoscience, and part of the edifice of scientific racism. History Lesions on the back of an enslaved African from Mississippi Found exclusively among African Americans, dysaesthesia aethiopica‚Äì \\"called by overseers 'rascality'\\" ‚Äìwas characterized by partial insensitivity of the skin and \\"so great a hebetude of the intellectual faculties, as to be like a person half asleep.\\" Other symptoms included \\"lesions of the body discoverable to the medical observer, which are always present and sufficient to account for the symptoms.\\" Cartwright contended that the existence of dysaesthesia aethiopica was \\"clearly established by the most direct and positive testimony,\\" but other doctors had failed to notice it because their \\"attention [had] not been sufficiently directed to the maladies of the negro race.\\" Cartwright felt that dysaesthesia aethiopica was \\"easily curable, if treated on sound physiological principles.\\"Caplan et al., p. 37. Insensitivity of the skin was one symptom of the disease, so the skin should be stimulated: Author Vanessa Jackson has noted that lesions were a symptom of dysaesthesia aethiopica and \\"the ever- resourceful Dr. Cartwright determined that whipping could ... cure this disorder. Of course, one wonders if the whipping were not the cause of the 'lesions' that confirmed the diagnosis.\\" According to Cartwright, after the prescribed \\"course of treatment\\" the slave will \\"look grateful and thankful to the white man whose compulsory power ... has restored his sensation and dispelled the mist that clouded his intellect.\\" According to Cartwright, dysaesthesia aethiopica was \\"much more prevalent among free negroes living in clusters by themselves, than among slaves on our plantations, and attacks only such slaves as live like free negroes in regard to diet, drinks, exercise, etc.\\" ‚Äì indeed, according to Cartwright, \\"nearly all [free negroes] are more or less afflicted with it, that have not got some white person to direct and to take care of them.\\" He explicitly dismissed the opinion which assigned the causes of the \\"problematic\\" behaviour to the social situation of the slaves without further justifications: \\"[The northern physicians] ignorantly attribute the symptoms to the debasing influence of slavery on the mind.\\" See also *Drapetomania, the name given to what was seen at one point in time to be a mental illness that caused black slaves to flee captivity. *Scientific racism ReferencesSources * Samuel A.

Featuring guitarist Sekou \\"Diamond Fingers\\" Diabat√©, who grew up in a traditional griot musical family, the band won over fans in Conakry, Guinea's capital city, during the heady days of that country's newfound independence. Bembeya Jazz fell onto harder times in the 1980s and disbanded for a number of years, but reformed in the late 1990s and toured Europe and North America in the early 2000s. 1960s In the aftermath of the Guinean Independence in 1958 and through the cultural policy of \\"authenticit√©\\", which encouraged cultural pride, numerous bands were created throughout the regions of Guinea. Guinea's President, Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, disbanded all private dance orchestras and replaced them with state-supported groups, such as Keletigui Et Ses Tambourinis and Balla et ses Balladins. The most popular was Bembeya Jazz National, formed in 1961. Bembeya Jazz, also referred to as the Orchestre de Beyla in the early days, started as the regional orchestra from the town of Beyla in southern Guinea. They were formed with the help of the local governor, Emile Kond√©, to act as the region‚Äôs \\"orchestre moderne\\". The initial line up included S√©kou Camara and Achken Kaba in the brass section on trumpets, S√©kou Diabat√© on guitar who was the youngest member at the time, Hamidou Diaoun√© on bass and Mory \\"Mangala\\" Cond√© on drums. Leo Sarkisian (who went on to join the Africa Service of the Voice of America in 1963) recorded Orchestre de Beyla in 1961 for the Hollywood based Tempo International label (Tempo 7015). The band were just being formed in Beyla and according to Sarkisian, called themselves Orchestra Bembeya, after a local river. The session also featured the female singer Jenne Camara as part of the band. The recording, one of ten Tempo LPs featuring a variety of Guinean music recorded by Sarkisian, was not released commercially. All 10 LPs were pressed in limited editions of 2,500 and released in 1962, but the majority of them were sent to the Guinean government. Bembeya's album was titled Sons nouveaux d'une nation nouvelle. R√©publique de Guin√©e. 2 Octobre 1962. 4√®me anniversaire de l'independance nationale. Orchestre de Beyla and included the songs Pr√©sentation, Yarabi, Lele, Din ye kassila, Wonkaha douba, Seneiro, Wassoulou and Maniamba. They became better known as Bembeya Jazz after the release of their first album and added singers Aboubacar Demba Camara and Salifou Kaba to the band. Specializing in modern arrangements of Manding classic tunes, Bembeya Jazz National won 1st prize at two national arts festival's in 1964 and 1965 and were crowned \\"National Orchestra\\" in 1966.Counsel (2009) Initially an acoustic group, featuring a Latin-flavored horn section of saxophone, trumpet, and clarinet, Bembeya Jazz National reached its apex with the addition of lead singer Aboubacar Demba Camara. The group toured widely, and became one of the most well-known groups in Africa. Among their biggest hits were the songs \\"Mami Wata\\" and \\"Armee Guineenne\\". Bembeya Jazz National‚Äôs most ambitious album, Regard Sur Le Passe, released in 1968, was a musical tribute to the memory of Samory Tour√©, who founded a Mande conquest state in much of what is now northern Guinea in 1870, and who became a nationalist emblem following 1958. 1970s and 1980s A live album, 10 Ans De Succes, was recorded during a 1971 concert, but set-back for the band came on April 5, 1973 when Demba Camara was killed in an auto accident on his way to a concert in Dakar. Although they remained together, Bembeya Jazz National was unable to duplicate the success of their earliest years. The group disbanded in 1991 with Sekou Diabat√© and Sekouba Bambino Diabat√© going on to successful solo careers. Reformation The band reformed in the late 1990s. Bembeya Jazz came together again in 2002 to perform at the Musiques Metisses d‚ÄôAngoul√™me world music festival in France. They remained there to record their first new album in 14 years for the director of the festival, Christian Mousset's Marabi label. The album, Bembeya, is a reworking of orchestra's greatest hits. They went on to tour Europe and North America. In 2007 they were featured in the documentary film Sur les traces du Bembeya Jazz.

Life He was born at Sessa Aurunca near Naples. He proceeded to Padua, where he studied philosophy. He lectured at Padua, Naples, Rome, and Pisa, and won so high a reputation that he was deputed by Leo X to defend the Catholic doctrine of immortality against the attack of Pomponazzi and the Alexandrists. In return for this he was made Count Palatine, with the right to call himself by the name Medici. Bust of Agostino Nifo (Liceo classico \\"Agostino Nifo\\", Sessa Aurunca) Work In his early thought he followed Averroes, but afterwards modified his views so far as to make himself acceptable to the orthodox Catholics. In 1495 he produced an edition of the works of Averroes; with a commentary compatible with his acquired orthodoxy. In the great controversy with the Alexandrists he opposed the theory of Pietro Pomponazzi, that the rational soul is inseparably bound up with the material part of the individual, and hence that the death of the body carries with it the death of the soul. He insisted that the individual soul, as part of absolute intellect, is indestructible, and on the death of the body is merged in the eternal unity.

L. Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xvi He was at Wellington College for a short time but left on account of ill-health. For this reason he was frequently sent home from school for rest, and spent a large amount of his time walking over Cornwall and studying Cornish monuments and history. He collected a large number of documents from all over the county. Henderson went to New College, Oxford and took his degree with first-class honours in modern history in 1922. He was a lecturer at University College, Exeter, and afterwards at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was elected to an official fellowship as tutor in modern history in 1929. He had settled down at Oxford, and was showing great promise as a teacher and lecturer. In 1928 Henderson published a book on Cornish bridges in collaboration with Henry Coates. Whenever he was able he would return to Cornwall and continue his historical research which in the early years was concerned very largely with the four western hundreds (Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder) but finally he planned a parochial history of the whole county on a grand scale.Henderson, Charles (1935) Essays in Cornish History; edited by A.

On October 15, 2004,Source: Sam Fox Fox donated $50,000 to Swift Boat Veterans For Truth (\\"SBVT\\"), a 527 group that opposed John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election by claiming that Kerry exaggerated his service record. The SBVT has, in turn, been criticized for allegedly failing to substantiate many of their claims. Fox noted that he made the donation after comparisons of President Bush to Adolph Hitler were posted on the website MoveOn.org. (See Ambassadorial nomination section below.) In later elections, Fox supported of the presidential candidacy of Mitt Romney and remained one of the most prominent Jewish donors to the Republican party. Fox is a past chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition. President George W. Bush appointed Sam and Marilyn Fox to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. Ambassadorial nomination Fox was nominated for the position of Ambassador to Belgium in December 2006. During his February 2007 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Fox was supported by both of Missouri's senators, Republican Kit Bond and Democrat Claire McCaskill, as well as by two former U.S. Senators from Missouri, John C. Danforth (Rep.) and Thomas F. Eagleton (Dem.). Danforth described him as \\"very bright...ebullient...(and) a soft touch,\\" while Eagleton, in a letter, called him \\"the epitome of a humanitarian.\\"Transcript of the Hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feb 27, 2007. The transcript is online at http://www.votesmart.org/public-statement/292929/hearing-of-the-senate- foreign-relations-committee-nominations Fox faced lengthy questioning from John Kerry, the target of attacks by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group to which Fox contributed in 2004. Kerry told Fox that he represented \\"the quintessential American Horatio Alger story\\" and that his experience was \\"impressive... (and) a lot more than some people bring to this table.\\" Kerry interrogated Fox for approximately 35 minutes, however, beginning with 20 minutes of questioning directly pertinent to the ambassadorial position for which Fox was nominated, such as the tensions over the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program which accessed transaction databases of the SWIFT network. Kerry continued with a series of questions related to Fox's financial support of SBVT, a 527 organization which had criticized Kerry's military record during the 2004 campaign. In response to the question from Kerry, \\"I assume that you believe the truth in public life is important,\\" Fox answered, \\"Yes, sir.\\" Kerry then followed with, \\"And might I ask you what your opinion is with respect to the state of American politics, as regards the politics of personal destruction?\\" to which Fox replied \\"I'm against 527s, I've always been against 527s....Senator Kerry, I very much respect your dedicated service to this country... Senator, you're a hero.\\" In response to follow up questions from Kerry, Fox said he had given to the 527 that attacked him because \\"when we're asked we generally give.\\" For example, he said, in the most recent two-year period, he had made more than 1,000 contributions, of which more than 100 were political. He did not express regret for his contribution to SBVT. He noted that 527s supporting both candidates in the electorate had made \\"mean and destructive\\" claims, and that a video posted on the MoveOn.com website has compared the President to Hitler. He said that as long as one side was making such claims, \\"politically it's necessary.\\" = Recess Appointment = On April 4, 2007, while the Senate was in recess, Bush used his power of recess appointment to appoint Fox to the position. This made Fox ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress, and effectively made him ambassador for the remainder of the Bush presidency.Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution = Reactions to the Recess Appointment = Senate / Democratic Reaction  Several Democratic Senators criticized Bush's decision to make a recess appointment when the nomination was no longer pending before Congress. They also argued that this use of the recess appointment power was illegal because of statutory restrictions applicable to ambassadorships. Three Democratic senators wrote a letter to the Government Accountability Office on April 5, 2007, calling for an investigation of whether President Bush's appointment of Sam Fox as U.S. ambassador to Belgium the previous day was legal. The letter, submitted by Democrats Chris Dodd of Connecticut, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, read: \\"We view the recess appointment of Mr. Fox as a clear abuse of the President's recess appointment power.\\" Dodd argued that the law that enables the president to make recess appointments was not created to get around the approval of the Senate. \\"This is really now taking the recess appointment vehicle and abusing this beyond anyone's imagination,\\" Dodd said, according to AP. \\"This is a travesty.\\" He said in a statement that what the President did was \\"deceptive at best and illegal at worst.\\"  Administration / Republican Reaction  The GAO, however, responded with an eight-page letter dated June 8, 2007, that the appointment had been legal. Indeed, the letter said \\"an alternative interpretation that would preclude Mr. Fox from serving in a recess appointment would raise serious constitutional questions.\\"Letter from GAO General Counsel to the Honorable Christopher J. Dodd, John F. Kerry and Robert P. Casey, Jr. and AP story, \\"GAO: Fox Appointment Didn't Violate Law\\" (http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=102x2893036).  Service as Ambassador  Fox served as Ambassador from April 2007 to January 2009. In December 2009, the U.S. Department of State's Office Inspector General filed its official report on his tenure. The report noted that Fox had \\"come to his job with significant and relevant executive leadership in the private sector.\\" It continued: \\"By all accounts, he used his business acumen and experience to excellent effect, notably in two areas. The first was in building important relationships with both the Belgian and American business communities, and with senior Belgian Government officials charged with financial and trade matters. The second was his active and visible outreach to the Belgian community to improve the image and standing of the United States at a time when both were suffering as a result of Belgian misgivings about U.S. policies, such as the Iraq war. His efforts in both areas were judged highly successful.\\"Report of Inspection, Embassy Brussels, Belgium, Report Number ISP-I-10-04A, December 2009 The report gave Fox particularly high marks for \\"shepherding to production a 20-minute film that highlights the closeness of Belgian-U.S. ties from the early 19th century. The film continues to play well to Belgian audiences and has been employed effectively to counter anti-American sentiment.\\" In 2012, three years after his term as Ambassador had ended, Fox's contributions were recognized with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown, bestowed by King Albert II.

Lenin's Mausoleum (seen here) served as a viewing tribune for Soviet leaders to review military parades on Red Square such as this one in June 1945. Tribune is an ambiguous ‚Äì and often misused ‚Äì architectural term, which can have several meanings. Today, it most often refers to a dais or stage-like platform or, in a vaguer sense, any place from which a speech can be prominently made. Etymology The English term tribune (\\"raised platform\\") was derived as early as 1762 from French (tribune) and Italian (tribuna) words. These in turn stemmed from Medieval Latin tribuna and from Classical Latin tribunal, the elevated placing of a tribune's (or other Roman magistrate's) seat for official functions in the manner of a throne. Meanings * In ancient Rome, the term was used of a semicircular apse in a Roman basilica, with a raised platform, where a presiding magistrate (a tribune, or others) sat in an official chair. Subsequently, it applied generally to any raised structure from which speeches were delivered, including makeshift wooden structures in the Roman Forum and even the private box of the emperor at the Circus Maximus. * In Medieval, and later, ecclesiastical architecture, the term applies to an area within a vaulted or semi-domed apse in a room or church. In this sense a tribune may contain a high altar or bishop's seat (cathedra). These features were particularly common in Roman and Byzantine church architecture. In these Christian basilicas the term is often retained for the semicircular recess behind the choir, as at San Clemente in Rome, Sant'Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna, San Zeno at Verona, or San Miniato near Florence. A secular example is its use for the celebrated octagon room of the Uffizi Palace at Florence. * The sense of the term is sometimes extended to any gallery, balcony, or triforium. (Nikolaus Pevsner, in his book series The Buildings of England (1951‚Äì74), is at pains to point out that a tribune and a triforium, while often confused, are not the same thing.) In a church, it may refer to an open arcade overlooking the nave of a church ‚Äì or indeed any large hall ‚Äì often situated below a clerestory. * The term is also loosely applied to various other raised spaces in secular or ecclesiastical buildings ‚Äì in the latter sometimes in the place of pulpit, as in the Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs at Paris. Thus,\\"tribune\\" can refer to a dais or stage-like platform, or in a vaguer sense any place in a building from which a speech can be prominently made, which seems a return to the original function of the early Roman tribunal. This is the origin of the common metaphorical use of \\"tribune\\" in the names of newspapers, magazines and broadcast news programs.

The attack utilises a differential characteristic over part of the cipher with a probability of 1 (for a few rounds‚Äîthis probability would be much lower for the whole cipher). The rounds immediately following the differential characteristic have a linear approximation defined, and we expect that for each chosen plaintext pair, the probability of the linear approximation holding for one chosen plaintext but not the other will be lower for the correct key. Hellman and Langford have shown that this attack can recover 10 key bits of an 8-round DES with only 512 chosen plaintexts and an 80% chance of success.

Biography He was the son of Stanis≈Çaw Bytnar, a teacher and soldier in the Polish Legions in World War I, and Zdzis≈Çawa Rechul√≥wna. He attended elementary school in Piast√≥w. In 1931 he was accepted to the Stefan Batory Gymnasium in Warsaw, where the Bytnar family moved in the same year. They lived in the Mokot√≥w district. In 1934, at the age of 13, he joined the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association. In 1938 he attained the highest non-instructor rank, \\"Scout of the Republic\\". Shortly before, in 1937, he began attending a lyceum; he graduated in May 1939. World War II After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Bytnar lived in occupied Warsaw and worked as a glazier and school tutor. In October 1939, together with a group of friends, he joined the short lived left wing Polish People's Independent Action (Polska Ludowa Akcja Niepodleg≈Ço≈õciowa, PLAN), a resistance group. As its member he composed and distributed pamphlets in response to the formation of the General Government by the Nazis. However, the organization was soon infiltrated by the Gestapo and broken up by January 1940. Bytnar left Warsaw and lived with his grandparents in Kolbuszowa in south-eastern Poland, where he also became involved in anti-Nazi resistance. Sometime early in 1940 he joined the Union of Armed Struggle, a precursor organization of the Home Army. In March 1941 he became a member of the Gray Ranks, a paramilitary underground scouting organization which carried out sabotage and diversion against the Germans. In particular, Bytnar and his cell focused on so-called \\"small sabotage\\" as part of the Wawer Group. =Arrest, death, and reprisal= He was arrested by the Nazis on 23 March 1943 and rescued three days later by a combat group of the Gray Ranks during the Operation Arsenal on 26 March. He died on 30 March, at the age of 21, from injuries sustained during the interrogation carried out by the Gestapo while in captivity. The extremely brutal interrogation of Bytnar was conducted by SS Rottenf√ºhrer Ewald Lange and SS Obersturmf√ºhrer Herbert Schultz. Both were later assassinated by the Gray Ranks. Schultz was shot dead on 6 May 1943 by S≈Çawomir Maciej Bittner (aka \\"Maciek\\") and Eugeniusz Kecher (aka \\"Ko≈Çczan\\"). Lange was shot dead on 22 May 1943 by Jerzy Zapadko (aka \\"Dzik\\").

Visitors to Colourscapes, wearing coloured cloaks, choose the journey they make through the interconnected chambers, becoming part of the sculpture, as the colour they wear changes as they move, dynamically altering the space that others see. Inside Colourscape, people are entirely surrounded by colour, which is transmitted from the inner surfaces as daylight filters through the plastic membrane from which Colourscape is made. This immersion in colour is an intense experience giving rise to interesting perceptual phenomena and emotional richness. The first Colourscape was made in 1971 by Peter Jones, and since 1978 Lynne Dickens has collaborated with him. Their partnership (Cwmni Colourscape) has developed more complex and larger Colourscapes while experimenting with different ways of showing the structures. They began to explore the relationship between colour, sound and movement from 1977, collaborating with musicians, dancers and singers. Since 1971, 36 different Colourscapes have been made and shown all over the UK and in Ireland, Australia, Germany, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Belgium, Switzerland and Finland. Colourscapes are hand-tailored from flexible vinyl sheet. They are part welded, using high frequency machines and part hand made, using liquid and other glues. The largest Colourscape (Festival 1) was made in 1994/1995, as a commission from the Nettlefold Trust (later becoming EyeMusic Trust), by the directors Simon Desorgher and Lawrence Casserley. Previous to this, since 1989 Colourscapes had been used once a year by the Nettlefold Festival as a venue for performance, and from 1995 the Colourscape Music Festival was born and continues on Clapham Common and other places. The collaboration between Cwmni Colourscape and EyeMusic has also led to other commissions. The smallest Colourscapes are specifically created for schools workshops. In 2011, there are 6 Colourscapes in existence. Over the years Colourscapes have been visited by thousands of people and Cwmni Colourscape now has a \`social document\` of visitors comments showing a shifting awareness of colour over the years. The belief that colour is powerful, capable of changing perception, stimulating creativity and that it is important to give people a harmonious and beautiful experience remains at the heart of Colourscapes\` existence. Also that the form of Colourscapes made possible the installation in public places so being accessible to many.

This concert was held during a political civil war in Jamaica between opposing parties Jamaican Labour Party and the People's National Party. The concert came to its peak during Bob Marley & The Wailers' performance of \\"Jammin'\\", when Marley joined the hands of political rivals Michael Manley (PNP) and Edward Seaga (JLP). Background Since he was elected Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1972, Michael Manley pursued a socialist agenda intended to redistribute wealth by nationalizing the country's major export industries. His agenda proved to be financially unsustainable, as his policies deterred foreign investment in Jamaica. Manley was also aggressively opposed by the CIA and American business interests, as had happened to similar reformist governments in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and multiple other countries throughout the Americas.William Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower, London: Zed Books, 2006, p.226. Beginning in 1974, he was also opposed by the more conservative Edward Seaga of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), and the two politicians hired local gangsters to help them increase their hold on power. Ironically, the idea for the One Love Peace Concert came from two such gangsters from rival political factions, who happened to be locked up in the same jail cell together and who both wanted to alleviate the violence. Claudius 'Claudie' Massop (JLP) and Aston 'Bucky' Marshall (PNP) decided that the best means to bring the country together was to use music as a uniting factor and organize a major concert. Quickly realizing that Bob Marley, living in exile in London, was a critical element upon which their success depended, Massop flew to London after being released from jail to convince Marley to perform at the event. Marley accepted the invitation, and the concert was Marley's first performance in Jamaica since the \\"Smile Jamaica\\" concert held days after he was shot in 1976. Concert The One Love Peace Concert brought together 16 of Reggae's biggest acts, and was dubbed by the media as the \\"Third World Woodstock\\", \\"Bob Marley plays for Peace\\" and simply, \\"Bob Marley Is Back.\\" The concert attracted more than 32,000 spectators with the proceeds of the show going towards \\"much needed sanitary facilities and housing for the sufferahs in West Kingston.\\" The concert was kicked off at exactly 5:00 PM with a message from Asfa Wossen, the crown prince of Ethiopia, praising the concert organizers‚Äô efforts to restore peace in Jamaica. This introduction to the event is important in illustrating the growing prevalence of the Rastafari movement in everyday Jamaican culture. The concert was divided into two halves, with the first half devoted to showcasing some of Reggae's newer talent, and the second half devoted to the more established artists. Jacob Miller energetically launched the second half of the concert, during which time Edward Seaga and Michael Manley got to their seats. The highlight of Miller's performance came when he \\"leaped onto the field with lighted spliff herb and offered it to a police man, donned the lawman‚Äôs helmet, jumped back onto the stage and continued the number as he paraded the herb.\\" Alternatively, Peter Tosh took the opportunity during his performance to berate the two political leaders sitting directly in front of him for their positions against legalizing marijuana. His set lasted 66 minutes, and Tosh spent almost half of that time denouncing the problems prevalent in society. At around 12:30 AM, Bob Marley took the stage to perform some of his biggest hits. The climax came during his performance of Jammin‚Äô when he called both Manley and Seaga to the stage, and in a symbolic gesture, the three held up their hands together to signify their unity. Bob Marley said the following as he called the two politicians onstage, and while he held their hands above his head and said while improvising on \\"Jammin'\\": Impact Unfortunately, the event did little to quell the political violence.

It won both the 1993 Nebula Award for Best Novelette1993 - The Nebula Awards, at Science Fiction Writers of America; retrieved June 2, 2017 and the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.1994 Hugo Awards, at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved June 2, 2017 The novelette involves two major themes: being widowed and the quest for a legendary Babbage computer. The \\"Georgia\\" of the title is the remote South Georgia Island which lies just north of Antarctica. Plot Summary The narrator, a computer scientist, gets a letter from former colleague Bill Rigley indicating that he has discovered components of an analytical engine which was apparently built in rural New Zealand in the mid 19th century. Traveling to New Zealand, the narrator is shown the machinery, which was discovered under a farm house near Dunedin as well as a book of scientific drawings and a journal. The journal contains entries written by someone with the initials L.D. who is in a romantic relationship with someone else, also with the initials L.D. One of them, a woman, built the analytical engine, the other drew the nature drawings. The narrator begins reading the journal. It is an account written by Luke Derwent who had fled to New Zealand with his half sister Louisa Derwent after the two fell in love and married. While Louisa builds her analytical engine, Luke explores the southern ocean with the help of Maori guides. On one of these explorations, Luke meets beings who the Maori call \\"the cold loving people\\". While these beings lack the \\"outward aspect\\" of humans, they are clearly intelligent and have amazing machines, including powerful medicine. Louisa takes sick and Luke determines to travel with her to the base of the \\"cold loving people\\" so that they may heal her. Bill shows the narrator a picture which Luke drew of the beings, which Louisa had named \\"Heteromorphs\\", showing them to be spider-like creatures about three feet tall. The narrator and Bill use information provided in Luke's journal to calculate that the Heteromorphs' base was on South Georgia Island. They begin planning a mission to South Georgia, hoping to beat several other groups which, having heard of the discovery, are planning to make their way to the island.

Though Honda's official model designations are typically Z50A, Z50J, Z50M, Z50R, and ZB50, they are commonly called the Monkey or Gorilla because of small frame's cramped riding posture, suggesting a simian crouch. Sales of the bike began in March 1964 with the Z50M model, and production ended in 2017. Design Most Z-series bikes are small, light, collapsible motorcycles made for convenience and ease of transportation. They have overhead cam four-stroke engines with an overhead cam. Some have a centrifugal clutch and a standard three-speed manual foot-shift lever, making it a semi-automatic transmission, while others have a conventional manual clutch and a three- or four-speed gearbox. The original model of the Honda Z-series was originally produced as a children's ride at a Japanese amusement park but was eventually refined and put into mass production, hitting the European market in 1967. Since then, Honda has produced a wide variety of Honda Z-series minibikes, with annual model updates still in effect. Starting from 2008, the well-known 50-cc engine will be adapted and fitted with an injection kit instead of a carburetor. Today, cheaper replica versions of this bike are being manufactured in China. Monkey bike is the name given by Honda to one of their small, low-powered motorcycles introduced in the 1960s. The first Honda Monkey was the 1961 Z100. Later Monkeys were designated Z50, such as the Z50A(US), J, M, R(US) and Z. These vehicles all had a , , single horizontal cylinder, four-stroke engine, and a seat height less than . The first Monkey bikes did not have any suspension, but the front forks were soon added. By 1974, when the Z50J was introduced (US 1972 Z50AK3), suspension had been added to the rear, as well. The first Monkey bikes had wheels, but later models had wheels. The early Z series Mini Trails are still highly popular, decades after the end of production, often selling for several times their original price. Refurbishment and upgrade parts are available from a variety of sources and vendors. The low power of the 49cc engine used in the Mini Trail and Super Cub has resulted in numerous upgrade possibilities, including replacement with larger and newer Honda horizontal engines. End of production In March of 2017, Honda Motorcycle president Chiaki Kato announced that the Z50 series would be discontinued in August 2017, due to new and pending emission-control regulations in Japan, which would be very difficult for small-displacement engines to meet. The model would be retired with the release of a limited-run 50th Anniversary Special Edition, which was only available to Japanese consumers. An online lottery, open from July 21 to August 21, was used to select buyers of the 500 units, which sold for ¬•432,000 (about $3,900) including consumption tax. This final model of the Z50 mixed aspects of the Z50A (1968) and the Z50AK3 (1972) with a plaid-covered seat duplicating the original Z50M and most parts were chrome plated. Similar and derivative designs Numerous similar small motorcycles predate the Honda model, notably the World War II Welbike motorcycle used by parachutists, and limited numbers of minibikes powered by a repurposed lawnmower and chainsaw engines were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. This type of design did not become commonplace or popular until the introduction of the mass-produced Z series. The Honda Dax model (the ST series in the North American market) is generally not considered a Monkey, but rather a bigger, two-seat variant, with larger wheels and usually a larger engine. The Dax models have a monocoque stamped sheet-metal frame, similar to some other early Honda motorcycles. This also houses the fuel tank, battery, and wiring loom. While Honda has ended production, there are several similar trail bikes being produced in China; some are parts-compatible with original Hondas. In 2018, Honda introduced the Honda Monkey (as the 2019 model year). While actually based on the Honda Grom, the model name, styling, and paint scheme are directly inspired by the early Z series.

History The Jasz (Jassic) people came to Hungary together with the Cumans, chased by the Mongols. They were admitted by the Hungarian king B√©la IV, hoping that they would assist in fighting against a Mongol-Tatar invasion. But shortly after their entry, the relationship worsened dramatically between the Hungarian nobility and the Cumanian-Jassic tribes and they left the country. After the end of the Mongol-Tatar occupation they returned and were settled in the central part of the Hungarian Plain. Initially, their main occupation was animal husbandry. During the next two centuries they were assimilated into the Hungarian population and their language disappeared, but they preserved their Jassic identity and their regional autonomy until 1876. Over a dozen settlements in Central Hungary (e.g. J√°szber√©ny, J√°sz√°roksz√°ll√°s, and J√°szf√©nyszaru) still bear their name. The historical, ethnographical and geographical region of J√°szs√°g, as well as of the modern J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County, are among the many place names linked to them. The name of the city of Ia»ôi in Romania may also derive from the name of the people. The only literary record of the Jassic language was found in the 1950s in the Hungarian National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library. It is a one- page glossary containing 34 words mainly related to products of agriculture (types of grain, cattle, etc.) probably compiled for fiscal or mercantile purposes. The glossary was interpreted with the help of Ossetian analogues from the Digor dialect.

It won the 1995 Hugo Award for Best Novelette, Locus Award and HOMer Award and the 1994 Nebula Award for Best Novelette, and was nominated for the Theodore Sturgeon award for best short fiction. The novelette was expanded into a novel and made into an eponymous film. Plot A single man who writes science fiction books and screenplays for a living, adopts a son who claims he is from Mars. The adoptive father comes to be intrigued by the possibility his son might really be a Martian. Ultimately, the father realizes that he loves his son whether or not he is a Martian. The son uses a magical \\"Martian wish\\" to be a human so he can remain with his father. Background The story is based on the author's own experiences as a single adoptive parent, with most of the key moments drawn from actual events. The main difference between the story and Gerrold's own experience is that Gerrold's son, Sean Friedman, never actually believed he was a Martian; the Martian identity was simply a game that the two of them played. The initial idea for the story actually came from the author overhearing another adoptive parent remark that her daughter had told her teacher that she [the adoptive daughter] was really a Martian. Although nothing specifically science fictional occurs in the story, Gerrold makes suggestive hints. David Gerrold was out about his homosexuality when he adopted his son. In the novelette, the sexuality of the protagonist is not disclosed although the novel identifies him as gay. In the feature film, the protagonist was a straight widower (with a female love interest), causing criticism from the LGBT community.

Armored Car Robbery is a heist movie, a subgenre of crime-based films. It tells the story of a well-planned robbery of cash from an armored car when it stops at a sports stadium. The heist goes awry and a tough Los Angeles cop sets off in hot pursuit of the culprits. Plot Mastermind Dave Purvis (William Talman) is a professional criminal who devises a scheme to rob an armored car on its last pickup of the day. He recruits Benny McBride, who brings Mapes & Foster to complete the gang of thieves. Benny needs money because Yvonne (Adele Jergens), his striptease artist wife, has lost interest in him and is seeing another man. Unbeknownst to Benny, the man she is two-timing him with is Purvis. The robbery itself, at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, begins as planned but goes badly wrong when a passing police patrol car intervenes. Purvis kills one of the police officers from the patrol car and he and his fellow robbers make their getaway. Lt. Jim Cordell (Charles McGraw), the dead policeman's partner, takes it upon himself to bring in his partner's killer and throws himself into the case, assisted by a rookie officer. Meanwhile, Purvis's gang unravels bit by bit as distrust and paranoia begins to build. Benny, wounded by police during the heist, is killed by Purvis as he demands his share of the loot from the robbery and attempts to seek medical help. Foster is killed by the police as the three attempt escape. After Mapes (Steve Brodie) gets away, he looks up Yvonne at the Burly Q where she works, intending to use her as a means to find Purvis, who has kept all the loot for himself. The waiting police, however, arrest Mapes at the Burly Q and learn Purvis's identity. After a further manhunt, Lt. Cordell and his team corner Purvis and Yvonne at Los Angeles Metropolitan Airport, and Purvis is crushed by a taking-off plane as he tries to escape across the runway.

Last accessed: January 26, 2008. =Noir analysis= According to American studies and film professor, Bob Porfirio, Armored Car Robbery possesses the \\"film noir visual style\\" of the many RKO crime and suspense films of the early 1950s, such as: high-contrast photography integrating studio and location shooting, expressionistic lighting, deep focus, and haunting music (by Roy Webb).Silver, Alain, and Elizabeth Ward, eds.

Film critic Roger Fristoe believed director Richard Fleischer pushed the boundaries of the Motion Picture Production Code. One edict was, \\"Methods of crime shall not be explicitly presented or detailed in a manner calculated to...inspire imitation.\\" Armored Car Robbery, however, had a blunt title, explicit violence and a detailed account of the planning and execution of the crime. As such, even though the criminals are caught, Armored Car Robbery tested the waters and helped set the stage for other films noir and heist films like The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and The Killing (1956) which shares some similarities..

In popular culture Net guns are becoming increasingly popular in both fiction and non-fiction settings, often seen as an \\"easy-fix\\" weapon for capturing a target without causing serious harm to it. One notable example of a net gun is used in the Predator series of films, most notably Predator 2 and Alien vs. Predator. This version is somewhat lethal, as it tightens around the target and cuts them like razor wire. Other examples include the films Total Recall, The Running Man and Escape from L.A., in which a net gun is used to capture the protagonist. The net gun used in the latter two references, as well as I, Robot is a real item. In \\"Birds in a Truck\\", an episode of the Discovery Channel television series MythBusters, Jamie Hyneman constructs a jury-rigged net gun using PVC, an air tank, a fishing net, and some tennis balls in an attempt to capture pigeons. The net gun functioned as planned, but Jamie failed to catch any of the pigeons. Recently, a net gun was seen on the MTV television series, Rob and Big, as a means of non-lethal home protection from unwanted intruders. After one was featured on Rob and Big, internet searches for net guns drastically increased.Google Trends Search Data for 'Netgun' The term has lately been adopted for fantasy weapons used in imaginary or text-based combat.

It is a belief found in many indigenous Mesoamerican cultures that a person upon being born acquires a close spiritual link to an animal, a link that lasts throughout the lives of both creatures. The person shows signs of whatever the animal's situation to include scratches and bruises if the animals get in fights, or illness if the animal is ill. It is in this way similar to the concept of Totem.  Etymology  The word comes from the Nahuatl word tonalli, meaning \\"day\\" or \\"daysign\\". In the Aztec belief system the day of a person's birth calculated in the Tonalpohualli would determine the nature of the person ‚Äì each day was associated with an animal which could have a strong or weak aspect. The person born on the day of for example \\"the dog\\" would then have the strong or weak aspect of the dog. In Nahuatl the word Tonalli was used to refer both to a day and to the animal related to that day. In Mayan belief the concept of an animal companion of a person was referred to as \\"Way\\". The modern Mixe people refer to it as Ts'ok (Lipp 1991). The Jakaltek Maya people of Concepcion Huista, Guatemala call it yixomal ispi·∫çan nax, meaning \\"soul bearer\\".  Studies  The study of tonalism was initiated by noted archaeologist, linguist and ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton who published a treatise called \\"Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History\\" which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced nagualism in Mexico in 1894. He identified the different beliefs associated with tonalism in some modern Mexican communities such as the Mixe, the Nahuas, the Zapotecs and Mixtecs.

McHugh. The novel is made up of several stories loosely intertwined. Title The novel's title derives from the name of the protagonist, a young gay man of mixed Chinese and Puerto Rican ancestry who goes by the name Rafael Zhang in non-Chinese contexts and Zhang Zhongshan in Chinese contexts. His Chinese given name, Zhongshan, is written with the characters with primary meanings \\"center\\" and \\"mountain\\"; the Mandarin name for China also begins with the character meaning \\"center\\" or \\"middle\\". Thus, \\"China Mountain\\" is an alternate reading of his Chinese given name. (Zhongshan is also one of the given names used by Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat- sen.) Plot summary The main story involves a man's maturation in a future dominated by China, where the United States has undergone a Communist revolution (the \\"Cleansing Winds Campaign\\") after a period of economic crisis. His personal evolution is paralleled by four side stories in his narrative, following characters progressing from arrogant outsiders to finding a place in society. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science The backdrop is a 22nd-century in which the Chinese Communist regime dominates the world. The novel is slightly unusual for science fiction in that none of the characters cause any significant change in the world around them; nor does it use any standard science fiction tropes. The New York Times said of the book when it first appeared: \\"A first novel this good gives every reader a chance to share in the pleasure of discovery; to my mind, Ms. McHugh's achievement recalls the best work of Samuel R. Delany and Kim Stanley Robinson without being in the least derivative.\\" Connections to other works McHugh's short story \\"Protection\\" is set in the same future history as China Mountain Zhang, detailing the experiences of a petty criminal in a \\"Reform Through Labor\\" camp in Kansas under the future Communist system. Awards and nominations The novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and Nebula Award for Best Novel and won a Lambda Literary Award, the Locus Award for Best First Novel, and the James Tiptree, Jr. Award.

Areas commonly included under this rubric include Korean history, Korean culture, Korean literature, Korean art, Korean music, Korean language and linguistics, Korean sociology and anthropology, Korean politics, Korean economics, Korean folklore, Korean ethnomusicology and increasingly study of Korean popular culture. It may be compared to other area studies disciplines, such as American studies and Chinese studies. Korean studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including \\"East Asian studies\\". The term Korean studies first began to be used in the 1940s, but did not attain widespread currency until South Korea rose to economic prominence in the 1970s. In 1991, the South Korean government established the Korea Foundation to promote Korean studies around the world. Korean studies was originally an area of study conceived of and defined by non-Koreans. Korean scholars of Korea tend to see themselves as linguists, sociologists, and historians, but not as \\"Koreanists\\" unless they have received at least some of their education outside Korea and are academically active (for example publishing and attending conferences)in languages other than Korean (most Korean studies publications are in English but there is also a significant amount of Korean Studies activity in other European languages), or work outside Korean academia. In the mid-2000s, Korean universities pushing for more classes taught in English began to hire foreign- trained Koreanists of Korean and non-Korean origin to teach classes. This was often geared towards foreigners in Korean graduate schools. There are now graduate school programs in Korean Studies (mostly active at the MA level) in most of the major Korean universities. BA programs in Korean Studies have now been opened at two Korean universities. The BA programs are distinctive in that they have few foreign students. * The Academy of Korean Studies (ÌïúÍµ≠ÌïôÏ§ëÏïôÏó∞Íµ¨Ïõê, AKS) est.1978 * The Korea Research Foundation (ÌïúÍµ≠ÌïôÏà†ÏßÑÌù•Ïû¨Îã®, KRF) est.1981 * The Korea Foundation (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ≠Ï†úÍµêÎ•òÏû¨Îã®) est.1991. * The Advanced Center for Korean Studies (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ≠ÌïôÏßÑÌù•Ïõê, ACKS) est.1995. Debates in the Field What exactly Korean Studies is, who is teaching it, who is learning, and what should be taught continues to be debated. There has been a small series of works debating Korean Studies published in academic journals. A sort of historical overview by Charles Armstrong titled \\"Development and Directions of Korean Studies in the United States\\" comes strongly from Armstrong's perspective teaching history at Columbia University, as his work: \\"Focusing on the discipline of history, ... traces the emergence of Korean Studies in the 1950s, the evolution of the field and the changing backgrounds of American scholars working on Korea in the 1960s to 1980s, and the rapid growth of Korean Studies since the early 1990s.\\" Another historian, Andre Schmid published an early contribution to the debate in 2008, challenging the ways that English academia was pushing or shaping the directions of Korean Studies. Schmid explained, \\"In the unequal global cultural arena where English still dominates, the direction of Korean Studies in the United States disproportionately shapes international representations of Korean culture.\\" University of Berkeley Sociologist John Lie contributed two pieces to the debate, the more recent of which challenged the Korean Studies, claiming \\"senior Koreanists seem rather content with their progress, telling their followers bizarre tales from the field and seeking to reproduce the archaic and mistaken Harvard East Asia paradigm.\\" Lie discusses the weaknesses he sees in this paradigm for the remainder of the essay. In 2018 CedarBough T Saeji published an article in Acta Koreana bringing in the perspective of teaching Korean Studies in Korea, focusing on \\"1) the struggle to escape the nation- state boundaries implied in the habitual terminology, particularly when teaching in the ROK, where the country is unmarked (‚ÄúHan‚Äôguk‚Äù), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is marked (‚ÄúPukhan‚Äù), and the diaspora is rarely mentioned at all; 2) the implications of the expansion of Korean Studies as a major within the ROK; 3) in-class navigations of Korean national pride, the trap of Korean uniqueness and (self-)orientalization and attitudes toward the West.\\" Notable centers of Korean studies outside Korea A-Z order *Beijing Foreign Studies University ‚Äî School of Asian and African Studies *Freie Universit√§t Berlin - Institute of Korean Studies *George Washington University ‚Äî GW Institute for Korean Studies (GWIKS) *Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences - Department of Korean and Mongolian Studies *University of British Columbia - Centre for Korean Studies *University of California, Berkeley ‚Äî Center for Korean Studies *University of California, Los Angeles ‚Äî Center for Korean Studies * Le Centre de Recherches sur la Cor√©e (CRC ou ¬´ Centre Cor√©e ¬ª) de l‚ÄôEHESS *University of Chicago ‚Äî Center for East Asian Studies *Columbia University ‚Äî Center for Korean Research *Harvard University ‚Äî Korea Institute *University of Hawaii ‚Äî Center for Korean Studies *Indiana University - East Asian Studies CenterInstitute for Korean Studies *Indiana University Bloomington - Center for Korean Studies *University of Leeds - Korea Research Hub, UK, Leeds *Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (University of Leuven, KU Leuven)- Center for Korean Studies *University of London School of Oriental and African Studies ‚Äî Centre of Korean Studies *Far Eastern Federal University ‚Äî Oriental Institute - School of Regional and International Studies *Novosibirsk State Technical University ‚Äî Faculty of Humanities - International Affairs and Regional Studies ( *University of Michigan ‚Äî Nam Center for Korean Studies *National Museum of Ethnology (Japan) *Ohio State University *University of Pennsylvania ‚Äî James Joo-Jin Kim Program in Korean Studies *University of Sheffield ‚Äî School of East Asian Studies *University of Central Lancashire ‚Äî International Institute of Korean Studies *Tenri University ‚Äî Department of Foreign Languages *Tufts University, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy ‚Äî Chair of Korean Studies *University of Tokyo ‚Äî Department of Korean Studies *University of Toronto ‚Äî Centre for the Study of Korea *Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City ‚Äî Faculty of Korean Studies, University of Social Sciences and Humanities *Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Institute for European Studies ‚Äî KF-VUB Korea Chair *University of Washington - Korea Studies Program, East Asia Studies, Henry M.

J. Cherryh, set in her Alliance-Union universe. The murder of a major Union politician and scientist has deep, long-lasting repercussions. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1989. The sequel, Regenesis, was published by DAW Books in January 2009. Background Founded in 2201 by a group of dissident scientists and engineers, the Cyteen star system includes the planet Cyteen and Cyteen Inner and Outer Stations. Cyteen declared its independence from Earth in 2300 CE and now serves as the capital of Union. It is located at Lalande 46650 (BD+01 4774). The planet's atmosphere is moderately toxic to humans, necessitating enclaves, or semi-encapsulated city-states, which influences Union's political outlook. Cyteen is seen as the antithesis of Earth; the heart of Union is the research facility Reseune, the center of all research and development of human cloning. Cloned \\"azi\\" provide the additional population Union needs to exist and expand, a policy which Earth and the Alliance, Union's main rival, deplore and refuse to sanction. Azi are incubated in vitro in \\"womb-tanks\\", but citizen (or \\"CIT\\") babies can also be cloned the same way, for example to replace a dead child. The fundamental difference between azi and regular humans is that they are educated from birth via \\"tape\\", a computer-controlled combination of conditioning and biofeedback training. This technology is not limited to azi; it is used by normal humans as well, though to a lesser extent and after they have a chance to develop (i.e. usually after the age of six). This results in profound psychological differences; for example, CITs are much more capable of handling new and uncertain situations, while azi are able to concentrate better. The overall educational programme of an azi is referred to as his or her \\"psychset\\". Designing tapes is an extremely complex discipline, since a badly designed psychset can cause azi to become emotionally unstable. Plot summary Ariane Emory is one of fourteen \\"Specials\\", Union-certified geniuses. In addition to her research on azi, she runs Reseune (founded by her parents) with the assistance of Giraud and Denys Nye. Emory is also a member of the Council of Nine, the elected, top-level executive body of Union. Two political factions vie for power in Union: the Centrists and the Expansionists. The latter, led by Emory, seek to enlarge Union through exploration, building new stations and continued cloning. Her political enemies, headed by Mikhail Corain, prefer to focus on the existing stations and planets. The Expansionists have held power since the foundation of Union, a situation fostered by \\"rejuv\\", which extends lifespans and staves off the effects of old age. Emory herself is 120 years old at the start of the novel ‚Äì and only just beginning to show signs of aging ‚Äì and has been the Councillor for Science for five decades. Emory's former co-worker and now bitter longtime rival, Jordan Warrick, is also a Special. Jordan has created and raised a clone of himself named Justin. Justin has grown up with and is very close to Grant, an experimental azi created by Emory from the slightly modified geneset of another Special. When Justin goes to work for Emory, she threatens to use Grant, who is Reseune property, for research. Using drugs and tape to overcome Justin's remaining resistance, she rapes the inexperienced seventeen-year-old. This trauma causes him to experience periodic debilitating \\"tape-flashes\\", similar to the flashbacks that PTSD sufferers experience. Justin does his best to hide the sordid matter from his \\"father\\", but Jordan eventually learns of it. He is furious and confronts Emory. She is found dead later that day. Though it could have been accidental, there is strong suspicion that she was murdered by Jordan. He protests his innocence, but agrees to a confession in order to protect both Justin and Grant. Because of his Special status, he has legal immunity and is only exiled to an isolated research facility far from Reseune. It is later revealed that Emory's rejuv was failing and she was already dying of cancer. Emory's last project had been the cloning of a promising young chemist to see if it was possible to recreate his abilities. An earlier attempt with Estelle Bok, the inventor of the equation that led to faster-than-light travel, had failed miserably. However, Emory believed this was due to the Bok clone growing up in a different social environment than the original. Emory's ultimate goal was to clone herself, with her successor reliving her life as closely as possible, down to her hormone levels and including two longtime bodyguard azi and companions, Florian and Catlin. Emory also created a sophisticated and powerful computer program to help guide her replacement. With her death and the resulting disruption to both Reseune and Union, the second project is begun immediately. Ari, the clone of Emory, is raised by Jane Strassen, a top Reseune scientist in her own right and the closest match to Emory's mother Olga. In addition, Florian and Catlin are replicated (a much easier task with azi). When Ari is seven, Strassen is abruptly transferred to another planet to simulate Olga's death. Denys Nye, now Reseune Administrator, takes over Ari's rearing. By this time, it is clear that the experiment has succeeded. Not only is Ari as brilliant as her predecessor, but due to technological advances, knowledge of the original's experiences, and better parenting by Jane Strassen, Ari is several years ahead of Emory's pace and better adjusted socially. When Ari is nearly nine, the Centrists, in a bid for power, attempt to use a scandal involving Emory ‚Äì the deliberate abandonment of a secret colony on the planet Gehenna. The Reseune authorities have Ari legally recognized as Emory's clone, entitled to take possession of her predecessor's property, in order to block the release of potentially damaging information. Denys is forced to reveal to his young ward who she is and how much her life has been manipulated. Because of deep Administration suspicion of his loyalties, Justin is warned to stay away from Ari. However, he cannot avoid bumping into her from time to time as she grows up. She comes to like him and appreciate his skills, particularly since his interests lie in her own area of research. Soon after she gains adult status, she has Justin and Grant transferred to her new department. However, when the sixteen-year-old makes a pass at him, she is shocked by his strong reaction. Justin is forced to reveal the reason. Ari discovers that Emory's rape of Justin had not just been for sex, but also a major \\"intervention\\" to free him from his father's domination, so he could work for Emory; it was left unfinished when she died. The younger Ari repairs the damage as best she can. Ari also comes to terms with the fact that she is much like her predecessor; it is sometimes hard to know where Emory's memories stop and Ari's start. She takes up the original's ultra-secret agenda, revealed to her by Base One, her guiding computer program, and unknown to anyone else. Emory had undertaken to restructure Union society to, in her view, save it from eventual collapse. Giraud Nye had taken over Emory's seat in the Council of Nine after her death. A major political crisis is precipitated by his death from old age, as well as the Paxers ‚Äì a terrorist group ‚Äì manipulating Jordan. An attempt on Ari's life is barely foiled when Justin's just-in-time warning enables Florian and Catlin to deal with an unexpected would-be assassin. Such a major breach in security could only have come from a top-rank Reseune source. Ari suspects Denys Nye. When Denys tries to lure her in for another try by promising to resign, Florian and Catlin kill him, much to Ari's regret.

Biography  Born on January 24, 1921 in Warsaw as a son of J√≥zef Zawadzki (a chemist engineer, professor, dean of the Faculty of Chemistry and rector of the Warsaw University of Technology, and later vice-rector of the secret Warsaw University of Technology; under the alias \\"Juliusz\\" active in Referral IIIc) and Leona nee Siemie≈Ñska (a teacher and educational activist). Zawadzki was born in a tenement house at 58 Piƒôkna Street. In the mid-1930s, the family moved to a flat on the ground floor of the so-called Professors' House at 75 Koszykowa Street, which was a part of the Polytechnic's buildings complex. During summer the Zawadzki family often stayed in their house at Queen Hedwig Street 11 in Zalesie Dolne.Grzegorz Szymanik. Dom \\"Zo≈õki\\" czeka na pomoc. \\"Gazeta Sto≈Çeczna\\", s. 4, 8‚Äì9 sierpnia 2015. Tadeusz Zawadzki began his studies at the Private School of the Society of the Mazovian School at Klonowa Street 16. In September 1933, he began his education at Stefan Batory State Gymnasium in Warsaw. In \\"Batory\\", Zawadzki continued his education in high school, in a class with mathematical and physical profile. Later soldiers of Warsaw Assault Groups: Jan Bytnar, Aleksy Dawidowski and Jan Wuttke studied in the same class.Stefan Kwiatkowski, Micha≈Ç Wiland: Materia≈Çy biograficzne wychowank√≥w Liceum i Gimnazjum im. Stefana Batorego w Warszawie. Warszawa: Stowarzyszenie Wychowank√≥w Liceum i Gimnazjum im. Stefana Batorego w Warszawie, wrzesie≈Ñ 1993, s. 123. From the Autumn of 1933, Zawadzki was a member of the 23rd Warsaw Scouting Team \\"Boles≈Çaw Chrobry\\", called the \\"Orangery\\". He passed his Matura exam at the end of May 1939. After the outbreak of the war, he left Warsaw to the east on September 6 as a member of the scouting marching Warsaw Banner. Zawadzki was active in the underground structures since October 1939, and when the scouts from the 23rd WDH formed the so-called War Orangery in 1941, he was elected commander of it under the alias \\"Lech Pomara≈Ñczowy\\" (Orange Lech). Tadeusz Zawadzki graduated from The Stefan Batory State Gymnasium in 1939 At the same time, in December 1939 and January 1940, he took part in the activities of small sabotage of a secret left-wing organization Polish People's Independence Action. From January to July 1940, he was a courier in the prison cell of the ZWZ (organized by Captain Zygmunt Hempel and Halina Starczewska-ChorƒÖ≈ºyna, later headed by Kazimierz Gorzkowski). The first page of his account, on the basis of which Aleksander Kami≈Ñski wrote Kamienie na szaniec ( Stones for the Rampart) (1943) In March 1941, together with his team, Zawadzki entered the Grey Ranks and took command over the Upper Mokot√≥w Troup in the South District of the Warsaw Banner. This troup immediately joined the \\"Wawer\\" Small Sabotage Organization, in which \\"Zo≈õka\\" was the commander of the Upper Mokotow District in the South District. At that time Tadeusz was one of the most outstanding executors of some of the most famous actions of small sabotage. For the largest number of \\"anchors\\" painted in his district, he was awarded the honorary title \\"Kotwicki\\" (Anchor-man) by the Commander-in-Chief of \\"Wawer\\" Aleksander Kami≈Ñski. Together with his troup, he also participated in the \\"N\\" Action (subversive propaganda in German conducted by BiP KG AK). After graduating from the Petty Scoutmaster Course (\\" The School behind the Forest\\") in May‚ÄìJune 1942, he received the rank of petty scoutmaster and the instructor pseudonym \\"Kajman\\" on August 15, 1942. On September 13, 1942, he organized all-day field exercises for his troop in the Chojnowski Forest near Warsaw. As a result of the reorganization of the Warsaw Banner of the Grey Ranks in November 1942, under the alias \\"Tadeusz\\", Zawadzki became the troup leader of the \\"Center\\" hive, the commander of the Warsaw Banner Assault Groups (consisting of 4 troops), and at the same time the deputy of Lieutenant Ryszard Bia≈Çous \\"Jerzy\\" ‚Äì military commander of the GS, i.e. the Special Unit \\"Jerzy\\", one of the dispatching units of Home Army Kedyw (Directorate of Diversion) which established at that time. After graduating from the Substitute Course of the Officers' School of Infantry Reserves, in January 1943 he was appointed the rank of officer cadet. Probably at that time, due to the significant burden of organizational duties, he had to stop his education from 1940 onwards. Zawadzki studied at the State School of Machine Building ‚Äì acting openly in place of the State Higher School of Machine and Electrical Engineering in Warsaw named after H. Wawelberg and S. Rotwand. From 1942 Zawadzki studied at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Higher State Technical School ‚Äì i.e. the secret Warsaw University of Technology. In the last days of April 1943, at his father's request, Zawadzki wrote a short report describing the activity of \\"Orangery\\" and the Grey Ranks, as well as the course of events during Operation Arsenal. It became the basis for Aleksander Kami≈Ñski's book Kamienie na szaniec [Stones for the Ramaprt]. He was arrested accidentally at the end of June or the beginning of July 1943, and spent a week or two in a correction labor camp at Gƒôsia Street (\\"The Goose house\\"). Tadeusz Zawadzki \\"Zo≈õka\\" After completing his first scouting course (May‚ÄìJune), he was awarded the title of scoutmaster on August 15, 1943. At that time he was appointed second lieutenant of the infantry reserve. He died in an attack on the watchtower of Grenzschutzpolizei in Sieczychy near Wyszk√≥w on the night of August 20‚Äì21, 1943, taking part in the \\"Tape\\" action as an observer. His name was given to the Home Army Battalion of the Grey Ranks ‚Äì the Zo≈õka Battalion.

As with all major American political parties, liberty is a core value. American conservatives generally consider individual liberty‚Äîwithin the bounds of American values‚Äîas the fundamental trait of democracy; this perspective contrasts with that of modern liberals, who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice and emphasize the need for state intervention to achieve these goals.Gregory L. Schneider, The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution \\"The label (conservatism) is in frequent use and has come to stand for a skepticism, at times an outright hostility, toward government social policies; a muscular foreign policy combined with a patriotic nationalism; a defense of traditional Christian religious values; and support for the free-market economic system.\\", \\"Within the conservative disposition in America, there are inherent contradictions between supporters of social order and tradition and supporters of individual freedom.\\" (2009) pp. 4‚Äì9, 136Sherwood Thompson, Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice. p. 7: \\"Historically...social justice became associated with liberalism in which equality is the ideal.\\", Rowman & Littlefield, 2014, . American political conservatives believe in limiting government in size and scope, and in a balance between national government and states' rights. Apart from some right-libertarians, they tend to favor strong action in areas they believe to be within government's legitimate jurisdiction, particularly national defense and law enforcement. Social conservatives, many of them religious, often oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil unions, and would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. They often favor Christian prayer in public schools and government funding for private Christian schools. Like most American political ideologies, conservatism originates from republicanism, which rejected aristocratic and monarchical government and upheld the principles of the United States Declaration of Independence (\\"... that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\\") and the United States Constitution (which established a federal republic under the rule of law). Conservative philosophy is also derived in part from the classical liberal tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, which advocated for laissez-faire economics (i.e. economic freedom and deregulation).Modern Political Philosophy (1999), Richard Hudelson, pp. 37‚Äì38M. O. Dickerson et al., An Introduction to Government and Politics: A Conceptual Approach (2009) p. 129. While historians such as Patrick Allitt and political theorists such as Russell Kirk assert that conservative principles have played a major role in American politics and culture since 1776, they also argue that an organized conservative movement with beliefs that differ from those of other American political parties did not emerge in the United States until the 1950s.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History, \\"before the 1950s there was no such thing as a conservative movement in the United States.\\", p. 2, Yale University Press, 2009, Kirk, Russell. The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot (1953) traced a continuous tradition since the 1790s. The recent movement conservatism is today based in the Republican Party, which has adopted conservative policies since the 1950s; the Southern Democrats were also important early figures in the movement's history.Vesla M. Weaver, \\"Frontlash: Race and the development of punitive crime policy.\\" Studies in American political development 21.2 (2007): 230‚Äì265.Glen Feldman, The Irony of the Solid South, \\"The worshipful allegiance white southerners gave to that party emanated most fundamentally from the deep-seated, pervasive, almost indellible cultural conservatism of the region...\\", University Alabama Press, 2013, . Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats together formed the Congressional conservative coalition in 1937, which played a major legislative role for much of the 20th century.  Overview  The history of American conservatism has been marked by tensions and competing ideologies. Fiscal conservatives and libertarians favor small government, laissez-faire economy, low income and corporate taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Social conservatives see traditional social values as threatened by secularism; they tend to support prayer in public schools, oppose abortion, and object to both same-sex marriage and civil unions for same-sex couples.Ahoura Afshar, \\"The Anti-gay Rights Movement in the United States: The Framing of Religion,\\" Essex Human Rights Review (2006) 3#1 pp. 64‚Äì79Glenn Utter and Robert J. Spitzer, Encyclopedia of Gun Control & Gun Rights (2nd ed. 2011) Neoconservatives want to expand what they see as American ideals throughout the world.Bruce Frohnen, ed. American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) pp. ix‚Äìxiv Paleoconservatives advocate restrictions on immigration, non- interventionist foreign policy, and opposition to multiculturalism. Most conservative factions nationwide, except some libertarians, support a unilateral foreign policy, and a strong military. Most, especially libertarians, support gun ownership rights, citing the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of \\"godless communism.\\"Paul Gottfried, Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right, p. 9, \\"Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism.\\" (2009); Gottfried, Theologies and moral concern (1995) p. 12. In the first 1955 issue of National Review, William F. Buckley Jr. explained the standards of his magazine and helped make explicit the beliefs of American conservatives: According to Peter Viereck, American conservatism is distinctive because it was not tied to a monarchy, landed aristocracy, established church, or military elite.Peter Viereck, Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill (1956), pp. 1‚Äì22. Instead American conservatives were firmly rooted in American republicanism, which European conservatives opposed. They are committed, says Seymour Martin Lipset, to the belief in America's \\"superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly status-bound system of European society.\\" = Ideology and political philosophy = In terms of governmental economic policies, American conservatives have been heavily influenced by the classical liberal or libertarian tradition as expressed by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman and a major source of influence has been the Chicago school of economics. They have been strongly opposed to Keynesian economics.George H. Nash, The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America since 1945 (2008) pp 446‚Äì55.Johan Van Overtveldt, The Chicago School: how the University of Chicago assembled the thinkers who revolutionized economics and business (2007). Traditional (Burkean) conservatives tend to be anti-ideological, and some would even say anti-philosophical, promoting, as Russell Kirk explained, a steady flow of \\"prescription and prejudice\\". Kirk's use of the word \\"prejudice\\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment. There are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives‚Äîthe traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as opposition to abortion and homosexuality. Religious conservatives often assert that \\"America is a Christian nation\\" and call for laws that enforce Christian morality. Fiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \\"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\\".Grover Cleveland, \\"The President's message, 1887\\" (1887) online p. 37 A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a death tax. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of Ludwig von Mises, believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \\"free market economics\\" is the most efficient way to promote economic growth. Many modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism. Through much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy. Thus it was the British Labour government‚Äîwhich embraced socialism‚Äîthat pushed the Truman administration in 1945‚Äì1947 to take a strong stand against Soviet Communism.John Callaghan, \\"The Cold War and the March of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\\", Contemporary British History, (2001) 15#3:1‚Äì25. online = Social conservatism and traditionalism = YES on 8 rally in Fresno, California Social conservatism in the United States is the defense of traditional social norms and Judeo-Christian values.See President Reagan's speech to governors in 1987 at Social conservatives tend to strongly identify with American nationalism and patriotism. They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country. Social conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.Darren Dochuk, From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism (W.W. Norton & Company; 2010) shows how migrants to Southern California from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas provided evangelical support for social conservatism. = Fiscal conservatism and economic liberalism = Fiscal conservatism is the economic and political policy that advocates restraint of progressive taxation and expenditure. Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as starve the beast. Activist Grover Norquist is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \\"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\\" The argument in favor of balanced budgets is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions. This belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement laissez-faire policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \\"rights.\\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets. Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that classical liberalism in the United States during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain: > [A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of > laissez-faire. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, > laissez-faire did not mean no government intervention at all. On the > contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, > railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited > producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers. The economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more economic freedom. Economic liberalism can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader small government philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with free-market or laissez-faire economics. Insofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the classical liberal tradition in the vein of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises. Classical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends. Modern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the Burkean notion of prescription: what works best is what is right. A belief in the importance of the civil society is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by Alexis de Tocqueville, there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book Democracy in America, Tocqueville described this as \\"soft oppression\\". Ronald Reagan gives a televised address from the Oval Office, outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt) While classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \\"simply more productive\\" or \\"simply the right thing to do\\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \\"umbrella\\" of the conservative movement. The archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century‚Äîthe Margaret Thatcher government in Britain and the Ronald Reagan administration in the U.S.‚Äîboth held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh√∂ffer (eds), Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique, Routledge (February 8, 2006), , p. 1. To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.Steven F. Hayward, The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980‚Äì1989 (2009), p. 477. Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%. This contrasts with statistics from 2004, when government spending was rising more rapidly than it had in decades.Chris Edwards, \\"Reagan's Budget Legacy,\\" CATO Institute June 8, 2004  Types  In the United States today, the word \\"conservative\\" is often used very differently from the way it is used in Europe and Asia. Following the American Revolution, Americans rejected the core ideals of European conservatism; those ideals were based on the landed aristocracy, established churches, and powerful armies. Conservatism in the United States is not a single school of thought. Barry Goldwater in the 1960s spoke for a \\"free enterprise\\" conservatism. Jerry Falwell in the 1980s preached traditional moral and religious social values. It was Ronald Reagan's challenge to form these groups into an electable coalition. In the 21st century United States, types of conservatism include: * Christian conservatism, whose proponents are primarily interested in family values. Typical positions include the view that the United States was founded as a Christian nation, that abortion is wrong, that there should be prayer in state schools, that intelligent design or creationism should be taught in schools alongside evolution, and that marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and not between two members of the same sex. Many attack the profanity and sexuality in the media and movies.see Steven Brint and Jean Reith Schroedel, eds., Evangelicals and Democracy in America, Volume II: Religion and Politics (Russell Sage Foundation, 2009) for scholarly studies This faction strongly supported Reagan in the 1980 election. Nevertheless, they intensely oppose the Reagan's 1981 nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court because she supported a woman's right to abortion. She was confirmed anyway.Prudence Flowers, \\"'A Prolife Disaster': The Reagan Administration and the Nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 53.2 (2018): 391‚Äì414. * Constitutional conservatism, a form of conservatism bound within the limits provided within the United States Constitution, defending the structures of constitutionalism, and preserving the principles of the United States Constitution. Chief among those principles is the defense of liberty. This form of conservatism coalesced in the Republican Party in the early 20th century, in opposition to progressivism within the party; it can also be seen being influential to the 21st century Tea Party movement. Constitutional conservatism has also been associated with judicial originalism. * Fiscal conservatism, a form of conservatism that focuses on low taxes and restrained government spending. * Libertarian conservatism, a fusion with libertarianism. This type emphasizes a strict interpretation of the Constitution, particularly with regard to federal power. Libertarian conservatism is constituted by a broad, sometimes conflicted, coalition including pro-business social moderates, those favoring more rigid enforcement of states' rights, individual liberty activists, and many of those who place their socially liberal ideology ahead of their fiscal beliefs. This mode of thinking tends to espouse laissez-faire economics and a critical view of the federal government. Libertarian conservatives' emphasis on personal freedom often leads them to have social positions contrary to those of social conservatives, especially on such issues as marijuana, abortion and homosexuality. Ron Paul and his son Rand Paul have been influential proponents in the Republican presidential contests. * Movement conservatism, an inside term for conservatives and the New Right in the United States. * Neoconservatism, a modern form of conservatism that supports a more assertive, interventionist foreign policy, aimed at promoting democracy abroad. It is tolerant of an activist government at home, but is focused mostly on international affairs. Neoconservatism was first described by a group of disaffected liberals, and thus Irving Kristol, usually credited as its intellectual progenitor, defined a neoconservative as \\"a liberal who was mugged by reality.\\" Although originally regarded as an approach to domestic policy (the founding instrument of the movement, Kristol's The Public Interest periodical, did not even cover foreign affairs), through the influence of figures like Dick Cheney, Robert Kagan, Richard Perle, Kenneth Adelman and (Irving's son) Bill Kristol, it has become most famous for its association with the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration in the Middle East that used aggressive military action to ostensibly promote democracy and protect American interests.Jean Edward Smith, Bush, \\"Bush precipitated the deterioration of America's position abroad, led the United States in a $3 trillion dollar war in Iraq that cost more than four thousand American lives, ... and inspired young Muslims throughout the world to join the jihad.\\", Simon & Schuster; Reprint edition (July 18, 2017), . * Paleoconservatism, in part a rebirth of the Old Right arising in the 1980s in reaction to neoconservatism. It stresses tradition, especially Christian tradition and the importance to society of the traditional family. Some such as Samuel P. Huntington argue that multiracial, multi-ethnic, and egalitarian states are inherently unstable.Samuel P. Huntington, \\"The Clash of Civilizations,\\" Foreign Affairs Summer 1993, v72, n3, pp. 22‚Äì50, online version. Paleoconservatives are generally isolationist, and suspicious of foreign influence. The magazines Chronicles and The American Conservative are generally considered to be paleoconservative in nature. * Social conservatism, a form of conservatism that focuses on the preservation of traditional moral values. * Traditionalist conservatism, a form of conservatism in opposition to rapid change in political and social institutions. This kind of conservatism is anti-ideological insofar as it emphasizes means (slow change) over ends (any particular form of government). To the traditionalist, whether one arrives at a right- or left-wing government is less important than whether change is effected through rule of law rather than through revolution and utopian schemes. * National conservatism, a modern variant of conservatism common in Europe and Asia that concentrates on upholding national and cultural identity,. Advocated by supporters of President Donald Trump that breaks with the \\"conservative consensus, forged by Cold War politics\\" of \\"markets and moralism\\". It seeks to preserve national interests, emphasizes nationalist ones, strict law-and-order policies and social conservatism (family as a home and a center of identity), opposes immigration and abandons laissez-faire, free-market economic policy to describe the movements in the United States supporting Donald Trump and in England supporting Brexit. A 2019 political conference featuring \\"public figures, journalists, scholars, and students\\" dubbed this variety of conservatism \\"National Conservatism\\". Critics allege its adherents are merely attempting to wrest \\"a coherent ideology out of the chaos of the Trumpist moment\\".  History  In the United States there has never been a national political party called the Conservative Party.Michael Kazin et al. eds. The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History (2011) pp 117‚Äì28. Since 1962, there has been a small Conservative Party of New York State. During Reconstruction in several states in the South in the late 1860s, the former Whigs formed a Conservative Party. They soon merged into the state Democratic parties. All major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, and that all men were created equal. Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.Arthur Aughey, Greta Jones, W. T. M. Riches, The Conservative Political Tradition in Britain and the United States (1992), p. 1: \\"[T]here are those who advance the thesis that American exceptionalism means [...] [but] there can be no American conservatism precisely because the American Revolution created a universally liberal society.\\" Historian Patrick Allitt expresses the difference between liberal and conservative in terms not of policy but of attitude: > Certain continuities can be traced through American history. The > conservative 'attitude' [...] was one of trusting to the past, to long- > established patterns of thought and conduct, and of assuming that novelties > were more likely to be dangerous than advantageous.Patrick Allitt, The > Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History (Yale > U.P. 2009), p. 278 No American party has advocated European ideals of \\"conservatism\\" such as a monarchy, an established church, or a hereditary aristocracy. American conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress.Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, p. 114, \\"Conservative ideas are, thus, more genuine and profound than many critics suggest, but such unity as they have is purely negative, definable only by its opposition and rejection of abstract, universal, and ideal principles...\\" Russell Kirk saw the American Revolution itself as \\"a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation\\".Russell Kirk, The Conservative Mind (1950), pp. 6, 63. = John Adams = Political conservatives have emphasized an identification with the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. Historians of conservative political thought \\"generally label John Adams as the intellectual father of American conservatism.\\"R.B. Ripley, \\"Adams, Burke, and Eighteenth-Century Conservatism.\\" Political Science Quarterly (1965). 80#2: 216‚Äì235. online Russell Kirk points to John Adams as the key Founding Father for conservatives, noting that \\"some writers regard him as America's most important conservative public man.\\"Russell Kirk, \\"Adams, John\\" in John Frohnen, ed., American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) p 11 Historian Clinton Rossiter writes: Historian A. Owen Aldridge places Adams, \\"At the head of the conservative ranks in the early years of the Republic and Jefferson as the leader of the contrary liberal current.\\"A. Owen Aldridge, \\"John Adams: Pioneer American Conservative.\\" Modern Age (2002) 44#3 pp 217‚Äì25. It was a fundamental doctrine for Adams that all men are subject to equal laws of morality. He held that in society all men have a right to equal laws and equal treatment from the government. However, he added, \\"no two men are perfectly equal in person, property, understanding, activity, and virtue.\\"Aldridge, p 224 Peter Viereck concluded: > Hamilton, Adams, and their Federalist party sought to establish in the new > world what they called a \\"natural aristocracy.\\" [It was to be] based on > property, education, family status, and sense of ethical responsibility. > [... Their motive was liberty itself. = Veterans organizations = There been numerous large veterans organizations in American history, most notably the Grand Army of the Republic, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946‚Äì1947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.Morten Bach, \\"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945‚Äì1950,\\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) Excerpt Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the American Legion Firing Line, a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the John Birch Society and antisemitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America (1999) pp 479‚Äì88. The Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the John Birch Society. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan. The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9‚Äì11, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.Timothy J Lynch, ed. The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Military and Diplomatic History (2013) 1: 38‚Äì40.  Recent policies  Russell Kirk, conservative theorist = Bible reading and prayer = In 1962, the Supreme Court Engel v. Vitale decision banned state- written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 Abington School District v. Schempp decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the religious right and by 1980 were avid supporters of Ronald Reagan.Adam Laats, \\"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\\" Journal of religious history 36.3 (2012): 319‚Äì334.William M. Beaney, and Edward N. Beiser, \\"Prayer and politics: the impact of Engel and Schempp on the political process.\\" Journal of Public Law 13 (1964): 475. = Reagan Era = President Ronald Reagan set the conservative standard in the 1980s. In the 2010s, the Republican leaders typically claim fealty to it. For example, most of the Republican candidates in 2012 \\"claimed to be standard bearers of Reagan's ideological legacy\\". Reagan solidified conservative Republican strength with tax cuts, a greatly increased military budget, continued deregulation, a policy of rollback of Communism (rather than just containing it), and appeals to family values and conservative morality. The 1980s and beyond became known as the Reagan Era.Sean Wilentz, The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974‚Äì2008 (2009); John Ehrman, The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan (2008). Typically, conservative politicians and spokesmen in the 21st century proclaim their devotion to Reagan's ideals and policies on most social, economic, and foreign policy issues. = Climate change = Modern conservative beliefs often include global warming denial and opposition towards government action to combat it, which conservatives contend would do severe economic damage and ultimately more harm than good even if one accepts the premise that human activity is contributing to climate change.Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism, Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349‚Äì385.George H. Nash, Reappraising the Right: The Past and Future of American Conservatism (2009) p. 325. = Law and order = They support a strong policy of law and order to control crime, including long jail terms for repeat offenders. Most conservatives support the death penalty for particularly egregious crimes. The \\"law and order\\" issue was a major factor weakening liberalism in the 1960s.Michael W. Flamm, Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s (2005). From 2001‚Äì2008, Republican President George W. Bush stressed cutting taxes and minimizing regulation of industry and banking, while increasing regulation of education.Julian E. Zelizer, ed. The Presidency of George W. Bush: A First Historical Assessment (2010) ch. 6. Conservatives generally advocate the use of American military power to fight terrorists and promote democracy in the Middle East. = Role of government = Conservative discourse generally promotes the view that government action is not the solution to problems such as poverty and inequality. In this view, government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose affirmative action policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \\"reverse discrimination\\". Conservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor. On the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support protectionism instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets. = Social issues = On social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles. They oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, civil unions, and anti-discrimination laws against homosexuals. The libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues, instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy. Business-oriented conservatives oppose the social conservatives if state laws limiting gay rights threaten to hurt business. The National Review reported in 2016 that, \\"as evangelical forces have become less unified...the influence of Right-leaning business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce has only grown.\\"Elasina Plott, \\"Georgia Religious-Liberty Fight Reveals Christian Right's Weakened Influence,\\" National Review April 4, 2016Dale McConkey, \\"Whither Hunter's culture war? Shifts in evangelical morality, 1988‚Äì1998,\\" Sociology of Religion 62#2 (2001): 149‚Äì174. In the culture war of recent decades, multiculturalism has been a flashpoint, especially regarding the humanities curriculum. Historian Peter N. Stearns finds a polarization since the 1960s between conservatives who believe that the humanities express eternal truths that should be taught, and those who think that the humanities curriculum should be tailored to demonstrate diversity.Peter N. Stearns, Meaning over Memory: Recasting the Teaching of Culture and History (1993). Generally conservatism opposes the \\"identity politics\\" associated with multiculturalism, and supports individualism. In campus battles, progressives demand \\"Cultural diversity\\" while conservatives denounce efforts to impose \\"political correctness\\" and stifle free speech.Rick Bonus, \\"Political Correctness\\" in Encyclopedia of American Studies, ed. Simon J. Bronner (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015), online Conservatives typically favor a \\"melting pot\\" model of assimilation into common English-speaking American culture, as opposed to a \\"salad bowl\\" approach that lends legitimacy to many different cultures.Milton Gordon, \\"E Pluribus Unum? The Myth of the Melting Pot.\\" in Olivier Zunz, John Bodnar, and Stephan Thernstrom, \\"American History and the Changing Meaning of Assimilation\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 4#2 (1985): 53‚Äì84. In the 21st century, conservatives have warned on the dangers of tolerating radical Islamic elements, of the sort that they say are engaging in large-scale terrorism in Europe.Bruce Pilbeam, \\"Eurabian nightmares: American conservative discourses and the Islamisation of Europe,\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies (2011) 9#2 pp. 151‚Äì171.  Electoral politics  According to a 2014 Gallup Poll, 38% of American voters identify as \\"conservative\\" or \\"very conservative,\\" 34% as \\"moderate,\\" 24% as \\"liberal\\" or \\"very liberal\\". These percentages were fairly constant from 1990‚Äì2009,Juliana Horowitz, \\"Winds of Political Change Haven't Shifted Public's Ideology Balance,\\" Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, press release November 25, 2008 when conservatism spiked in popularity brieflyGallup, \\"U.S. Political Ideology Stable With Conservatives Leading\\" Gallup, August 1, 2011, online before reverting to the original trend while liberal views on social issues reached a new high. Although, the study does show some distinction between the concentration of moderates and conservatives or liberals between the Republican and Democratic parties. Among Democrats, 44% are self-identified liberals, 19% as conservatives, and 36% as moderates. For Republicans 70% self-identified as conservative, 24% as moderate, and 5% as liberal. Conservatism appears to be growing stronger at the state level. The trend is most pronounced among the \\"least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states.\\" according to Atlantic writer Richard Florida. In the United States, the Republican Party has been the party of conservatism since the 1890s, although there was a strong Eastern liberal wing. Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, based in the South and strongly opposed to Civil Rights, grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3‚Äì1 Democratic to 3‚Äì1 Republican between 1960 and 2000. In addition, some American libertarians, in the Libertarian Party and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes‚Äîfor instance, further dismantling the welfare system or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the Cato Institute, and libertarian intellectuals such as David Boaz describe libertarianism as being \\"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\\" = Geography = thumbPercent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010: The South, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountain states, and Alaska are generally conservative strongholds. The Northeast, Great Lakes Region, West Coast and Hawaii are the main liberal strongholds. In the 21st century, rural areas of the United States (blue-collar, evangelical, older than other areas of the U.S., and predominantly white) are generally conservative bastions. Voters in the urban cores of large metropolitan areas tend to be more liberal and Democratic. Thus, there is a division between urban, suburban, exurban, and rural areas within each state.  Other topics = Russell Kirk's principles of conservatism = Russell Kirk developed six \\"canons\\" of conservatism, which Gerald J. Russello described as follows: # A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, divine revelation, or natural law. # An affection for the \\"variety and mystery\\" of human existence. # A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions. # A belief that property and freedom are closely linked. # A faith in custom, convention, and prescription. # A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \\"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\\" Modern Age 38: 354‚Äì363. . Kirk said that Christianity and Western civilization are \\"unimaginable apart from one another\\"Book Review by Robert S. Griffin of Chilton Williamson Jr., The Conservative Bookshelf: Essential Works That Impact Today's Conservative Thinkers, robertsgriffin.com. and that \\"all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief.\\"Stephen Goode, Higher Education: Uniting the Great Books and Faith (August 2, 2004), Thomas Aquinas College. In later works, Kirk expanded this list into his \\"Ten Principles of Conservatism\\" which are as follows: # First, the conservative believes that there exists an enduring moral order. # Second, the conservative adheres to custom, convention, and continuity. # Third, conservatives believe in what may be called the principle of prescription. # Fourth, conservatives are guided by their principle of prudence. # Fifth, conservatives pay attention to the principle of variety. # Sixth, conservatives are chastened by their principle of imperfectability. # Seventh, conservatives are persuaded that freedom and property are closely linked. # Eighth, conservatives uphold voluntary community, quite as they oppose involuntary collectivism. # Ninth, the conservative perceives the need for prudent restraints upon power and upon human passions. # Tenth, the thinking conservative understands that permanence and change must be recognized and reconciled in a vigorous society. = Courts = One stream of conservatism exemplified by William Howard Taft extols independent judges as experts in fairness and the final arbiters of the Constitution. In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.Lewis L. Gould, The William Howard Taft Presidency (2009) p. 175Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary (2002) p. 111. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a liberal Democrat, did not attack the Supreme Court directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the conservative coalition. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937‚Äì60.Jeff Shesol, Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court (2010) p. 525. Conservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power. A recent variant of conservatism condemns \\"judicial activism\\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the Warren Court in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to Abraham Lincoln's attacks on the Dred Scott decision of 1857.Graber and Perhac, Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary (2002) p114Mark V. Tushnet, A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future of Constitutional Law (2005) p. 338.  Originalism  A more recent variant that emerged in the 1980s is originalism, the assertion that the United States Constitution should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted. Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, strict constructionism, which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, former federal judge Robert Bork and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.Johnathan O'Neill, Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history (2005) pp. 7‚Äì11, 208.  Federalism  According to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights: > The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people > numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more > sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases > opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for > more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government > more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile > citizenry.Center for the Study of Federalism, \\"U.S. Constitution (2017) > online. From the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights has been a \\"Fig Leaf for conservatives\\": > Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. > Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of > women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other > disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the > commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and > narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.Herman Schwartz, \\"The Supreme > Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives.\\" The Annals of the American > Academy of Political and Social Science 574.1 (2001): 119‚Äì131. online. = Opposition to environmentalism = In the past, conservatives have supported conservation efforts, from the protection of the Yosemite Valley, to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, more recently, conservatives have opposed environmentalism; with environmentalists often ridiculed as \\"tree huggers\\". Republican Party leaders such as Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann advocate the abolition of the EPA, calling it \\"the job-killing organization of America.\\" Conservative think tanks since the 1990s have opposed the concept of man-made global warming; challenged scientific evidence; publicized what they perceived as beneficial aspects of global warming, and asserted that proposed remedies would do more harm than good. The concept of anthropogenic global warming continues to be an ongoing debate among conservatives in the United States, but most conservatives reject the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans. A 2015 poll showed that 73% of Republicans believed humans were uninvolved in causing global warming. American conservatives have generally supported deregulation of pollution and reduced restrictions on carbon emissions. Similarly, they have advocated increased oil drilling with less regulatory interference, including oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In the 2008 election, the phrase, \\"Drill baby drill\\" was used to express the Republican position on the subject. President Donald Trump rolled back over 100 Obama- administration rules regarding the environment. President Trump also announced that the U.S. would stop making payments to the United Nations program \\"Green Climate Fund\\". = Semantics, language and media = Socialism  The term \\"socialist\\" has been used as a \\"rhetorical weapon\\" against the left by conservatives. David Hinshaw writes that William Allen White, editor of a small-town newspaper in Kansas from 1895, used \\"socialistic\\" as \\"his big gun to blast radical opposition.\\"David Hinshaw, A Man from Kansas: The Story of William Allen White (1945) p 108. White set \\"Americanism\\" as the alternative, warning, \\"The election will sustain Americanism or it will plant Socialism.\\" White became famous when Mark Hanna, campaign manager for Republican candidate William McKinley distributed upwards of a million or more copies of one White editorial to rally opposition to William Jennings Bryan, the nominee of both the Democratic and Populist parties. By the 1950s, the conservative press had discovered that the word 'socialism' \\"proved to be a successful derogatory epithet rather than a descriptive label for a meaningful political alternative.\\" At the 1952 Republican national convention, former President Herbert Hoover repeated his warnings about two decades of New Deal policies, denouncing, says Gary Best, \\"The usurpation of power by the federal government, the loss of freedom in America, the poisoning of the American economy with fascism, socialism, and Keynesianism, the enormous growth of the federal bureaucracy.\\" Barry Goldwater in 1960 called for Republican unity against John F. Kennedy and the \\"blueprint for socialism presented by the Democrats.\\" Goldwater in 1964 attacked central planners like fellow Republican Nelson Rockefeller, implying he was a socialist in a millionaire's garb: \\"The Democratic party believes in what I call socialism: and if that upsets anybody's stomach, let me remind you that central planning of our economy is socialism.\\" Ronald Reagan often quoted Norman Thomas, the perennial Socialist nominee for president in the New Deal era, as saying, \\"The American people would never knowingly vote for Socialism, but that under the name of liberalism, they would adopt every fragment of the socialist program.\\" In 2010, Newt Gingrich defined \\"socialism in the broad sense\\" as \\"a government- dominated, bureaucratically-controlled, politician-dictated way of life.\\" Gingrich believes Barack Obama is committed to this form of socialism.Tom Schaller, \\"Gingrich Slams Paulson, Obama, Sarbanes-Oxley and Even W (a little)\\" FiveThirtyEight May 24, 2010 = Modern media = Conservatives gained a major new communications medium with the resurgence of talk radio in the late 1980s. William G. Mayer, reports that \\"conservatives dominate talk radio to an overwhelming, remarkable degree.\\"William G. Mayer,\\"Why talk radio is conservative.\\" Public Interest 156 (2004): 86‚Äì103. This dominance enabled them to spread their message much more effectively to the general public, which had previously been confined to the major Big Three television networks. Political scientists Jeffrey M. Berry and Sarah Sobieraj conclude that, \\"conservatives like talk radio because they believe it tells them the truth. Liberals appear to be much more satisfied with the mainstream media and are more likely to believe that it is accurate.\\"Jeffrey M. Berry and Sarah Sobieraj, \\"Understanding the rise of talk radio.\\" PS: Political Science & Politics 44#4 (2011): 762‚Äì767. Rush Limbaugh proved there was a huge nationwide audience for specific and heated discussions of current events from a conservative viewpoint. Other major hosts who describe themselves as conservative include: Michael Peroutka, Jim Quinn, Dennis Miller, Ben Ferguson, William Bennett, Andrew Wilkow, Lars Larson, Sean Hannity, G. Gordon Liddy, Laura Ingraham, Mike Church, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin, Michael Savage, Kim Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Michael Reagan, Jason Lewis, Ken Hamblin, and Herman Cain. The Salem Radio Network syndicates a group of religiously oriented Republican activists, including Roman Catholic Hugh Hewitt, and Jewish conservatives Dennis Prager and Michael Medved. One popular Jewish conservative, Laura Schlessinger, offers parental and personal advice, but is outspoken on social and political issues. In 2011, the largest weekly audiences for talk radio were 15 million for Limbaugh and 14 million for Hannity, with about nine million each for Glenn Beck, Michael Savage and Mark Levin. The audiences overlap, depending on how many each listener dials into every week.Jeremy M. Peters, \\"'Anybody but Mitt,'\\" New York Times Nov. 19, 2011. Fox News features conservative hosts. One such host is Sean Hannity, who also has a talk radio program. One former host is Matt Drudge; prior, and after his time on Fox News, Drudge has operated Drudge Report a news aggregation website and is a self-professed conservative. It is more conservative than other news sources in the United States, such as National Public Radio and CNN. Canadian-American political commentator David Frum has been a critic of this development, and has argued that the influence of conservative talk radio and Fox News has harmed American conservatism, turning it from \\"a political philosophy into a market segment\\" for extremism and conflict making \\"for bad politics but great TV.\\" = Academia = Admission to academia  Liberal and leftist viewpoints have dominated higher education faculties since the 1970s, according to many studies,Everett Carll Ladd and Seymour Martin Lipset, Academics, politics, and the 1972 election (1973)Jack H. Schuster and Martin J. Finkelstein, The American Faculty: The Restructuring of Academic Work and Careers (2008) p. 145Louis Menand, The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University (2010) pp. 137‚Äì139 whereas conservatives are better represented in policy-oriented think tanks. Data from a survey conducted in 2004 indicated that 72% of full-time faculty identify as liberal, while 9‚Äì18% self-identify as conservative. Conservative self-identification is higher in two-year colleges than other categories of higher education but has been declining overall. Those in natural sciences, engineering, and business were less liberal than those in the social sciences and humanities. A 2005 study found that liberal views had increased compared to the older studies. 15% in the survey described themselves as center-right. While the humanities and the social sciences are still the most left leaning, 67% of those in other fields combined described themselves as center-left on the spectrum. In business and engineering, liberals outnumber conservatives by a 2:1 ratio. The study also found that more women, practicing Christians, and Republicans taught at lower ranked schools than would be expected from objectively measured professional accomplishments. A study by psychologists Yoel Inbar and Joris Lammars, of the Netherlands' Tilburg University, published in September 2012 in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, found that, in social and personality psychology, about a third of those surveyed say that they would to a small extent favor a liberal point of view over a conservative point of view. A 2007 poll found that 58% of Americans thought that college professors' political bias was a \\"serious problem\\". This varied depending on the political views of those asked. 91% of \\"very conservative\\" adults agreed compared with only 3% of liberals. That same year a documentary, Indoctrinate U, was released which focuses on the perceived bias within academia. On the other hand, liberal critic Paul Krugman wrote in The New York Times that this phenomenon is more due to personal choice than some kind of discrimination or conspiracy, noting that, for example, vocations such as military officers are much more likely to be filled by conservatives rather than liberals. Additionally, two studies published in the journal of the American Political Science Association have suggested that the political orientations of college students' professors have little influence or \\"indoctrination\\" in terms of students' political belief.  Relativism versus universal truths  Postmodernism is an approach common in the humanities at universities that greatly troubles conservative intellectuals. The issue is relativism versus absolute truths. Ellen Grigsby says, \\"Postmodern perspectives contend that any ideology putting forward absolute statements as timeless truths should be viewed with profound skepticism.\\" Kellner says, \\"Postmodern discourse frequently argues that all discourses and values are socially constructed and laden with interests and biases. Against postmodern and liberal relativism, cultural conservatives have argued for values of universal truth and absolute standards of right and wrong.\\"Kellner, Grand Theft 2000 p. 140 Neoconservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has energetically rejected postmodern academic approaches: > [Postmodernism in history] is a denial of the objectivity of the historian, > of the factuality or reality of the past, and thus of the possibility of > arriving at any truths about the past. For all disciplines it induces a > radical skepticism, relativism, and subjectivism that denies not this or > that truth about any subject but the very idea of truth‚Äîthat denies even the > ideal of truth, truth is something to aspire to even if it can never be > fully attained. Jay Stevenson wrote the following representative summary of postmodern literary studies of the sort that antagonize conservatives: > [In the postmodern period,] traditional literature has been found to have > been written by \\"dead white males\\" to serve the ideological aims of a > conservative and repressive Anglo hegemony. [...] In an array of reactions > against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the > tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary > theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and > prejudices. These prejudices are often covert‚Äîdisguised in literature and > other discourses as positive ideals and objective truths‚Äîbut they slant our > sense of reality in favor of power and privilege. Conservative intellectuals have championed a \\"high conservative modernism\\" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths.Gerald J. Russello, The Postmodern Imagination of Russell Kirk (2007) p. 14 Many argued that natural law was the repository of timeless truths. Allan Bloom, in his highly influential The Closing of the American Mind (1987) argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great classics that shaped Western culture. His book was widely cited by conservative intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativists.Jeffrey Williams, ed. PC wars: Politics and theory in the academy (Routledge, 2013).  Historiography  In recent years, historians have agreed that they need to rethink the role of conservatism in recent American history.Kim Phillips-Fein, \\"Conservatism: A State of the Field,\\" Journal of American History (Dec 2011) 98#3 pp. 723‚Äì743, with commentary by Wilfred M. McClay, Alan Brinkley, Donald T. Critchlow, Martin Durham, Matthew D. Lassiter, and Lisa McGirr, and response by Phillips-Fein, pp. 744‚Äì773 online. An important new approach rejects the older consensus that liberalism was the dominant ethos. Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933‚Äì1938) and the Great Society (1964‚Äì1966).Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \\"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\\" International Labor & Working-Class History, (2008) 74: 3‚Äì32. However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \\"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated. The movement was as fragile as the New Deal coalition that it replaced. [...] Policy change has thus proved to be much more difficult than conservatives hoped for.\\"Julian E. Zelizer, \\"Rethinking the History of American Conservatism,\\" Reviews in American History (2010) 38#2 pp. 367‚Äì392, quoting pp. 372, 379. Zelizer does find four areas where conservatives did make major changes, namely retrenchment of domestic programs, lowering taxes, deregulation, and opposition to labor unions. He concludes, \\"The fact is that liberalism survived the rise of conservatism.\\"Zelizer, \\"Rethinking the History of American Conservatism,\\" p. 379, quote p. 380. = American exceptionalism = American conservatives typically promote American exceptionalism, the idea that the United States is inherently different from other nations and has a duty to take the lead in spreading democracy and free markets to the world. Reagan especially articulated this role (and many liberals also agree with it). They see American values emerging from the American Revolution, thereby becoming what political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset called \\"the first new nation\\"Seymour Martin Lipset, The first new nation (1963). and developing a uniquely American ideology, \\"Americanism\\", based on liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, republicanism, democracy, laissez-faire capitalism and Judeo- Christian values. Although the term does not necessarily imply superiority, many neoconservative and other American conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense.Lipset, American Exceptionalism, pp. 1, 17‚Äì19, 165‚Äì174, 197\\"In Defense of American Exceptionalism,\\" The American Spectator \\"the conditions American Exceptionalism provides , allow us to enjoy the economic and social mobility that other countries envy\\" and \\"progressivism rejects American Exceptionalism\\". To them, the U.S. is like the biblical \\"City upon a Hill\\"‚Äîa phrase evoked by Puritan settlers in Massachusetts as early as 1630‚Äîand exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries.Harold Koh, \\"America's Jekyll-and-Hyde Exceptionalism\\", in Michael Ignatieff, ed.American Exceptionalism and Human Rights (2005) p. 112. Scholars have argued that British and European conservatism has little or no relevance to American traditions. According to political scientist Louis Hartz, because the United States skipped the feudal stage of history, the American community was united by liberal principles, and the conflict between the \\"Whig\\" and \\"Democratic\\" parties were conflicts within a liberal framework.Louis Hartz, The Liberal Tradition in America (1955), p. 17 In this view, what is called \\"conservatism\\" in America is not European conservatism (with its royalty, landowning aristocracy, elite officer corps, and established churches) but rather 19th century classical liberalism with an emphasis on economic freedom and entrepreneurship.Rainer-Olaf Schultze et al., Conservative parties and right- wing politics in North America (2003), p. 15 online This is in contrast to the view that Burkean conservatism has a set of universal principles which can be applied to all societies. In The Conservative Mind, Russell Kirk argued that the American Revolution was \\"a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation\\". Liberal historian Richard Hofstader criticized modern American conservatives as \\"pseudo-conservatives\\" because their negative reaction to the policies of Harry Truman showed \\"dissatisfaction with American life, traditions and institutions\\" and because they had \\"little in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism\\".  Thinkers and leaders  John C. Calhoun = Scholarly views on the genetics and psychology of politics = In Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political DifferencesJohn R. Hibbing, Kevin B. Smith, John R. Alford, Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences, Routledge, 2013, . three respected scholars provide an in-depth psychological explanation of how a person's genetic makeup predisposes them to be liberal or conservative. The book provides telling examples of how people as erudite and thoughtful as William F. Buckley Jr., Gore Vidal, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson descend to insults, lawsuits, duels, and slander when they are unable to defend their positions by rational argument. = Clinton Rossiter's Giants = Clinton Rossiter, a leading expert on American political history, published his history of Conservatism in America (1956) and also a summary article on \\"The Giants of American Conservatism\\" in American Heritage.Rossiter, Clinton, \\"The Giants of American Conservatism\\", American Heritage 1955 6(6): 56‚Äì59, 94‚Äì96 His goal was to identify the \\"great men who did conservative deeds, thought conservative thoughts, practiced conservative virtues, and stood for conservative principles\\". To Rossiter, conservatism was defined by the rule of the upper class. He wrote, \\"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\\" His \\"giants of American conservatism\\" were John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Elihu Root, and Theodore Roosevelt. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \\"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list\\". Rossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \\"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\\", Rossiter said conservatives may \\"take special pride\\" in James Madison, James Wilson, Roger Sherman, John Dickinson, Gouverneur Morris and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against Jacksonian democracy include Joseph Story and Josiah Quincy in Massachusetts; Chancellor James Kent in New York; James Madison, James Monroe, and John Randolph of Roanoke in Virginia. In the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that Grover Cleveland, Elihu Root, William Howard Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt \\"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy\\". In what Rossiter called the \\"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism‚Äîespecially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations. Writing in 1955, Rossiter suggests that Robert A. Taft, Charles Evans Hughes, and Dwight D. Eisenhower may someday be added to the list.

It is situated in Val Susa, from the French border. Its name derives from Latin: ad petram sistrariam, that is at sixty Roman miles from Turin.  Geography  Sestriere has 929 inhabitants and is located on the pass that links Val Chisone and Val Susa, at above mean sea level The village is completely surrounded by mountains, which have been exploited to build one of the biggest ski resorts in Italy. The main mountains around Sestriere are: Monte Fraiteve in the north-east, Monte Sises , Punta Rognosa di Sestriere and Monte Motta in the south-east. Sestriere is divided into several smaller hamlets: Sestriere Colle, on the pass top, Sestriere Borgata, in Val Chisone, Champlas du Col and Champlas Janvier, in Val Susa.  History  Formerly, the pass belonged to the municipality of Cesana, but from 18 October 1934 the area was unified with the hamlet of Borgata (formerly belonging to Pragelato) to create the new municipality of Sestriere. The ski resorts at Sestriere were built in the 1930s by Giovanni Agnelli and have been further developed after the Second World War by his nephew Giovanni Nasi. Tourism  Sestriere in winter Location of Sestriere in the province of Turin. Mount Motta in Sestriere = Winter sports = Sestriere is a popular skiing resort; during the winter holidays the population goes up to about 20,000 people. Together with the villages of Pragelato, Claviere, Sauze d'Oulx, Cesana Torinese and San Sicario, and Montgen√®vre in France, it makes up the Via Lattea (Milky Way) skiing area. Sestriere is connected to 146 skiable pistes, for a total of up to of trails, of which 120 are provided with artificial snow. Sestriere has also one of the few facilities where it is possible to ski at night on a floodlit run. It regularly hosts FIS Alpine Ski World Cup events, and it hosted the FIS World Championships in 1997, and the IPC World Championships in 2011. It was a main venue during the 2006 Winter Olympic Games and the 2006 Winter Paralympics, hosting all the men's alpine skiing competitions and being the site of one of the three Olympic Villages.2006 Winter Olympics official report. Volume 3. pp. 83‚Äì5. The two hotel towers, one of which was part of the Olympic Village, were built in the 1930s by FIAT's founder Giovanni Agnelli, and have become the symbol of the village; these were the first buildings of the village.  Linked resorts (Via Lattea)  Pragelato - the resort is part of the Via Lattea (Milky Way), is connected to this area by the Pattemouche-Anfiteatro cableway, built in 2006. Claviere - This small resort is just over the border in Italy and is included in the Monts de la lune lift pass. It is where the Olympic cross country ski teams practised for the Olympics in 2006. San Sicario - The biathlon and Alpine skiing events were held there in the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. They also held the bobsleigh and luge events here. One can attempt the Olympic women's super G and downhill courses. Sauze d'Oulx - Free Style Skiing Olympic events held here in 2006. The resort is acclaimed for its lively apr√®s-ski. Serre Chevalier - Nearby French resort with over of skiing. There is a free day of skiing here on your lift pass. Montgen√®vre - Nearby French resort with over of pistes. Montgenevre's ski area has 8 green runs, 12 blue, 22 red and 10 black slopes and is linked to the Via Lattea (Milky Way) ski area. There is a free day of skiing here on your lift pass. = Summer sports = In the summertime it is possible to play golf on Europe's highest 18-hole course. It is also a starting and arrival point in the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia. It was the scene of the moment in Lance Armstrong's career when he rode away from the field in a breakaway uphill finish to take the stage in the 1999 Tour de France, which was the first time he won the race, although he was later stripped of his seven victories. Due to its location across two valleys, Sestriere is close to several hiking paths. An elite track and field athletics meeting was held annually in Sestriere from 1988 to 1996, and again in 2004. The advantage of its high altitude in sprinting and jumping events held out hope of world records, with sponsor Ferrari offering a car as a bonus. One record was set, in the in the men's pole vault by Sergey Bubka in 1994; the men's and women's records in long jump were also beaten, but wind assisted. ;  Transportation  Due to its position, Sestriere can only be reached by car or bus. Trains from Torino stop in Oulx (Val Susa). From there, several buses bring passengers to Sestriere. The highway also stops in Oulx, but a municipal road leads to the village in 20 minutes.

The company also operates out of six other offices in New York, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, Munich and Shanghai. As of December 2017, the firm, including its various predecessors, have raised approximately $51 billion (USD) since 1981. Apax Partners is one of the oldest and largest private equity firms operating on an international basis, ranked the fourteenth largest private equity firm globally.Based on rankings provided by Private Equity International based on capital raised between 2007 and 2012. Apax invests exclusively in certain business sectors including: telecommunications, technology, retail and consumer products, healthcare and financial and business services. Apax raises capital for its investment funds through institutional investors including corporate and public pension funds, university and college endowments, foundations and fund of funds. One of the firm's co-founders, Alan Patricof, was an early investor in Apple Computer and America Online (AOL). History Apax Partners Worldwide is the product of the combination of three firms: *Patricof & Co., founded in 1969 in New York by pioneering venture capitalist Alan Patricof; *Multinational Management Group (MMG), founded in 1972 by Sir Ronald Cohen and Maurice Tch√©nio;\\"Patricof & Co. Ventures Strategically Takes On 'Apax Partners' Name in Plan to Fortify Leading Global Private Equity Role\\" Business Wire, Sept 10, 2001. *Saunders Karp & Megrue, founded in 1988 by Thomas A. Saunders III and Allan W. Karp and joined by John Megrue in 1992. =Patricof & Co. and MMG= In 1969, Alan Patricof founded Patricof & Co. a firm dedicated to making investments in \\"development capital\\" later known as \\"venture capital,\\" primarily in small early-stage companies. Patricof, one of the early venture capitalists, was involved in the development of numerous major companies including America Online, Office Depot, Cadence Design Systems, Apple Computer and FORE Systems.2006 Wharton Private Equity Conference Keynote Speaker In 1975, Patricof launched 53rd Street Ventures, a $10 million vehicle. Meanwhile, in 1972, Sir Ronald Cohen and Maurice Tch√©nio, along with two other partners, founded Multinational Management Group (MMG) with offices in London, Paris, and Chicago. MMG initially was established as an advisory firm, working with small emerging companies, rather than an investment firm. However, MMG initially struggled to gain traction amid the negative economic conditions, particularly in the UK in the mid-1970s. By 1977, two of the original four founding partners had left MMG, leaving Cohen and Tch√©nio in need of a partner to help rejuvenate their firm. In that year, Cohen approached Alan Patricof to join them and run the new firm's investments in the U.S. The new firm would be known as Alan Patricof Associates (APA) and ultimately come to be known as Apax Partners (based on a play on Patricof's name: Alan Patricof Associates Cross (x) Border). Following the merger, MMG abandoned its advising business, and the new APA shifted its focus exclusively to investing in start-up companies. =1980s-21st century= Throughout the 1980s, the firm grew steadily raising capital under a series of separate funds. As the 1980s progressed, the firm introduced its first later stage venture fund in 1984, its first growth capital fund in 1987 and its first dedicated European leveraged buyout fund MMG Patricof European Buy-In Fund in 1989.Source: Thomson Financial's VentureXpert www.venturexpert.com In response to the changing conditions, in the venture capital industry in the 1980s Apax (and other early venture capital firms including Warburg Pincus and J.H. Whitney & Company) began to transition away from venture capital toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments, which were in vogue in that decade.POLLACK, ANDREW. \\"Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor.\\" The New York Times, October 8, 1989.LUECK, THOMAS J. \\"HIGH TECH'S GLAMOUR FADES FOR SOME VENTURE CAPITALISTS .\\" The New York Times, February 6, 1987. This trend was more prevalent in Europe than the U.S. where Patricof preferred to continue focusing on venture investments. In 1991, Apax Partners became the official name for all of its European operations however the U.S. business still operated under the Patricof & Co. name. By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally. In 2000, Patricof & Co. adopted the Apax Partners branding and formalized its affiliation with its European business. The U.S. business would operate as Apax Partners, Inc. The following year, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies. In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form Greycroft Partners which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"New Fund for Prominent Investor\\". The New York Times, March 6, 2006. Despite the closer relations between the U.S. and European teams, the firm still operated separate fund entities for each geography. The European side of the business began to pull away in terms of capital commitments, raising more than $5 billion for its 2004 vintage European fund but just $1 billion for its 2006 U.S. vintage fund. =Saunders Karp & Megrue= In 2005, Apax announced it would acquire middle market leveraged buyout firm Saunders Karp & Megrue to augment its buyout business in the United States. Saunders Karp, formerly based in Stamford, Connecticut, was founded in 1989 by Thomas A. Saunders III and Allan W. Karp. John Megrue, who today serves as co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, had worked as a principal at Patricof & Co. before joining Saunders Karp in 1992.\\"Company News; British Buyout Firm Buys out American Buyout Firm.\\" The New York Times, February 25, 2005 Saunders Karp had received capital commitments from institutional investors including AT&T; Corporation, the General Electric Pension Trust, Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group, HarbourVest Partners, JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, New York State Common Retirement Fund and Verizon, among others.Saunders Karp & Megrue: Our Firm (Cached version of company website as of April 2, 2005.)

Criticisms= British United Shoe machinery (2000) = The circumstances surrounding the demerger, transfer of assets and subsequent collapse of the British United Shoe Machinery in 2000 led to questions about Apax's behaviour being raised in Parliament by MPs of both main parties. After calls for an enquiry into the loss of hundreds of pensions were refused, Ros Altmann, the pensions expert and, as of 2015, UK Pensions minister described it \\"one of the worst cases ..I have seen ..the actions of the former owners - Apax have been immoral.\\" The politician Ashok Kumar said, \\"I think these people needed flogging\\" ..these are greedy, selfish, capitalists who live on the backs of others. = Hellas Telecommunications (2015)= Following its sale of Wind Hellas in 2007, Apax and Hellas co-owner TPG were sued by former bondholders of the telecom company, who allege that Apax and TPG unjustifiably enriched themselves from Hellas and misrepresented the true state of its accounts. Apax has countered that some of these bondholders only began their dispute after passing up on the chance of selling prior to the bankruptcy of 2009, and that Apax sold the business in 2007 (almost three years before the bankruptcy) and so was not the legal owner of Hellas during the periods cited in some of the lawsuits. (In 2005 a New York judge awarded $56m to some of these bondholders, made against Hellas Telecommunications Finance and Hellas Finance, rather than Apax or TPG). Other lawsuits related to Apax and TPG's ownership of Hellas are being heard in the USA. In December 2015 a separate legal action brought by the liquidators of Hellas Telecommunications was dismissed by a Luxembourg court. In February 2018 the liquidators abandoned their UK case against Apax and TPG after four days of trial.\\"COURT: Hellas Telecommunications liquidators abandon lawsuit against Apax and TPG, costs hearing week of 5 March,\\" Debtwire.com, February 23, 2018.

Early life and career Jergens in 1945 Born in Brooklyn, New York, as Adele Louisa Jurgens (some sources say Jurgenson), she rose to prominence in the late 1930s when she was named \\"Miss World's Fairest\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In the early 1940s, she briefly worked as a Rockette and was named the number-one showgirl in New York City. After a few years of working as a model and chorus girl, including being an understudy to Gypsy Rose Lee in the Broadway show Star and Garter in 1942, Jergens landed a movie contract with Columbia Pictures in 1944, with brunette Jergens becoming a blonde. At the beginning of her career, she had roles in movies in which she was usually cast as a blonde floozy or burlesque dancer, as in Down to Earth starring Rita Hayworth (1947) and The Dark Past starring William Holden (1948). She played Marilyn Monroe's mother in Ladies of the Chorus (1948) despite being only nine years older than Monroe. She played an exotic dancer in Armored Car Robbery, and a criminal‚Äôs girl in Try and Get Me (both 1950) and appeared in the movie Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951). She had a part in The Cobweb (1955), directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Richard Widmark and Lauren Bacall. She worked in the 1950s radio show Stand By for Crime as Glamourpuss Carol Curtis with her real-life husband Glenn Langan as Chuck Morgan. Personal life and death In 1949, while filming Treasure of Monte Cristo, a film noir set in San Francisco, she met and married co-star Glenn Langan. Jergens and Langan remained married until his death from lymphoma on January 26, 1991, at age 73. They had one child, a son named Tracy Langan, who eventually worked in Hollywood behind the scenes as a film technician. Tracy died of a brain tumor in 2001. Death Adele Jergens-Langan, who retired from the screen in 1956, died on November 22, 2002, from pneumonia in her Camarillo, California, home. Her death came just four days before her 85th birthday.

History  Martin Manley founded Alibris in 1997 with the team behind early online book marketplace Interloc, which Alibris purchased. Interloc was founded by book seller Richard Weatherford, programmer Tom Sawyer and computer tech Brad Councilman in 1994. Interloc was one of the earliest successful efforts to centralize used book data online. It remained a private network until 1996, when the company launched its website built in Thunderstone Texis by Senior Engineer Michael Warchut. The Alibris website was launched on October 23rd 1998 at 14:30PM EST also built by Michael Warchut. Alibris was incorporated in 1998. Alibris acquired Bibliocity in October 1999. The company was backed by venture capital until 2006, when it was purchased by Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity firm. In February 2010, Oak Hill Capital Partners bought Monsoon and merged it with Alibris with Monsoon Commerce owning Alibris. As of February 2017, Alibris was owned by AM Holding Inc. (formerly Monsoon Commerce Inc.) In 2017 Alibris Holding sold off Monsoon Commerce of Portland and Stonegde Technologies of Collegeville, PA, and Alibris was subsequently sold in June 2017 to a private investor. The company remains privately owned.  Company  Booksellers list their inventories on Alibris which in turn offers the books on its retail website, a separate library services site, and business-to-business partners such as Barnes & Noble, Half Price Books, and eBay. It also offers services in the UK through the Alibris.co.uk website. It offers more than 250 million books from a network of over 6000 booksellers in 65 countries. Most sales made through Alibris are fulfilled by the bookseller directly to the end customer. Sales to libraries or other institutions or books needing transoceanic shipping are consolidated in a distribution center in Sparks, Nevada. Alibris also has a similar network for music (albums, cassette tapes, and CDs) and movies (VHS or DVD). Alibris allows customers to buy and sell at the same time. Alibris charges a starting fee that varies based on what is being sold and what kind of commission is charged. Alibris was a charter member of the Google eBooks service when it was announced by Google on December 6, 2010.

They first appeared in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966), as enemies of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century. Fictional history The Khunds controlled a vast galactic empire. In the 30th and the 31st centuries, their relationship with the United Planets fluctuated between uneasy d√©tente and open warfare. When the U.P. first discovered the Khundian civilization, the Khunds responded by attempting to conquer Earth. They nearly succeeded with the assistance of Nemesis Kid, a saboteur whom they planted in the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, Nemesis Kid was exposed and the invasion was repelled.Adventure Comics (vol. 1) #346-347 (July‚ÄìAugust 1966) The Khunds opposed the U.P. and the Legion at numerous times in the future. For example, the Khunds and the Dark Circle invaded Earth during the so-called \\"Earthwar\\". It was soon revealed that both groups were being manipulated by the sorcerer Mordru, who almost conquered Earth before being defeated by the Legion.Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #241-245 (July‚ÄìNovember 1978) =Khundian Legionnaires= During the \\"Five Years Later\\" arc of Legion continuity, Mordru casts a massive spell allowing him to animate and control the corpses of dead warriors throughout United Planets territory, and use them as an invasion force. U.P. worlds which were conquered by the Khundian empire are not spared from this phenomenon, prompting the Khunds to form a temporary alliance with the Legion. Four superpowered Khunds join the Legion: Firefist, a cyborg; his wife Veilmist, a teleporter; Blood Claw, who possesses indestructible claws; and Flederweb, a winged bounty hunter.Legion of Super- Heroes (vol. 4) #44 (June 1993) Included in the animated undead force that invaded the planet Sklar are corpses of the many deceased members of the Legion. Blood Claw is killed by Magnetic Kid's undead body.Legion of Super- Heroes (vol. 4) #46 (August 1993) Firefist attempts to murder Devlin O'Ryan, but is seemingly killed himself when Devlin's reflective power repels the Khund's weapon blast back at him.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #47 (September 1993) The group manages to defeat Mordru, and the Khunds force Veilmist and Flederweb to resign from the Legion.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #48 (October 1993) Some time later, it is revealed that Firefist survived,Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #57 (May 1994) and that the Khunds have initiated a plot to destroy Weber's World. Veilmist offers to assist the Legion in foiling the plot, but is killed by Firefist.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #58 (June 1994) Flederweb is revealed to be not a Khund, but a mind- controlled member of an unspecified alien race. After he is freed from Khundian control and helps the Legion save Weber's World, Flederweb joins the Heroes of Lallor.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #59 (July 1994) The events of the \\"Five Years Later\\" era were erased from mainstream DC continuity following the Zero Hour limited series. Thus, the saga of the Khundian Legionnaires is currently viewed as non-canonical. However, Veilmist, Firefist, and a shot of Flederweb's arm appeared in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5, among dozens of Legionnaires pulled out of alternate realities.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 =20th and 21st centuries= During the 20th and 21st Centuries, the Khunds were extreme enemies of the Thanagarians because of their planetary proximity.Legends They superficially resemble humans, but average larger and more muscular in build, with pale magenta skin. Khunds have codified rules of combat. Khund bodies have much denser bone and muscle tissue than humans. The planet Khundia is a heavy gravity world.As seen in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966) The Khunds were part of the alien group that attacks Earth in the Invasion! crossover.Invasion! #1-3 (January‚ÄìMarch 1989) In Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #19 it is revealed the Khund homeworld had been devastated by the attack of the aliens called 'Ichor'.

Influenced by early Baroque principles, the church was remodeled by Andrea Pozzo between 1703 and 1705. The Jesuit Church is located on Dr. Ignaz Seipel-Platz, immediately adjacent to the old University of Vienna buildings.  History  The Jesuit Church was built between 1623 and 1627 on the site of an earlier chapel, at the time when the Jesuits merged their own college with the University of Vienna's philosophy and theology faculty. The emperor broke ground for both college and church, with the church itself dedicated to Saints Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier. In 1703, Brother Andrea Pozzo, S.J., an architect, painter, and sculptor, and a master in the quadratura, was requested by Emperor Leopold I to redecorate the church. He added twin towers and reworked the fa√ßade in an early Baroque style with narrow horizontal and vertical sections. The design of the windows, narrow niches (with statues), and the small central part of the fa√ßade deviate from the Baroque style of the towers. Pozzo died unexpectedly in 1709, just before he was to move to Venice, and was buried in the church. After the completion of the work, the church was re-dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.  Interior  Despite its relatively austere exterior, the interior is remarkably opulent with ersatz marble pillars, gilding and a number of allegorical ceiling frescoes. The semicircular vault ceiling was divided in four bays with paintings in perspective, using illusionary techniques. Executed by Andrea Pozzo in 1703, the remarkable trompe l'oeil dome, painted on a flat part of the ceiling, is a real masterpiece.

Description Tasmanian giant crab in Sydney Aquarium, Australia The Tasmanian giant crab is one of the largest crabs in the world, reaching a mass of and a carapace width of up to . Among crabs only the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) can weigh more. Male Tasmanian giant crabs reach more than twice the size of females, which do not exceed . Males have one normal-sized and one oversized claw (which can be longer than the carapace width), while both claws are normal-sized in the females. This crab is mainly whitish-yellow below and red above; the tips of the claws are black. Small individuals are yellowish-and-red spotted above. Behaviour The Tasmanian giant crab feeds on carrion and slow-moving species, including gastropods, crustaceans (anomura and brachyura) and starfish. Cannibalism also occurs. They breed in June and July, and the female carries the 0.5‚Äì2 million eggs for about four months. After hatching, the planktonic larvae float with the current for about two months before settling on the bottom. The species is long-lived and slow-growing; juveniles moult their carapace every three-four years and adult females about once every nine years. This greatly limits the breeding frequency, as mating is only possible in the period immediately after the old carapace has been shed, and the new is still soft. Fishery The Tasmanian giant crab has been commercially fished in Tasmanian waters since 1992 and a minimum size was established in Australia in 1993. Fishing is typically by pots in water deeper than . Following concerns surrounding the sustainability of catch numbers, the total allowable catch was adjusted in 2004 to . Twenty-five operators competed for the catch in 2005, delivering a total catch valued at about A$2 million.

The TR4A was an evolution of the Giovanni Michelotti styled TR4. The car had been favorably received for its overall performance and many amenities but criticized for its harsh ride. The TR4's Hotchkiss drive system was replaced with an independent rear suspension, indicated by an \\"IRS\\" badge attached to the TR4A's rear. Changes from the TR4 TR4A Engine TR4A Interior The new rear suspension was a semi-trailing arm system with coil springs and lever-arm shocks. This system more closely resembled that of the Triumph 2000 than the swing axle systems used in the Herald or Spitfire. The chassis was redesigned to accommodate the new suspension at the rear, with extensive changes to the side members and cross-bracing. The redesign had the desired effect, with reviewers commenting on the improved ride comfort, although some felt that the car's handling had not improved. The chassis revisions resulted in a car roughly wider than the TR4, although length and height were unaffected. The wheelbase was shorter. The front track was unchanged, while the rear track grew by with the IRS. The car was heavier by . Although consideration was given to both an enlarged 2.5 liter four-cylinder or a six-cylinder engine, the TR4A used the same long- stroke, high-torque Standard four-cylinder wet-sleeve engine seen in the TR4. While the bore, stroke, and displacement remained the same, changes to the cylinder head and manifolds raised net power to and torque to , an increase of 10 percent. Apart from the increase in width and the IRS badge on the rear of the car, other changes included a revised grille and new hood badge. There was also a new line of chrome trim on the side, starting near the rear edge of the door and ending at the front of the car with integrated signal/marker lights, which were moved from their earlier position in the corners of the grille. New smaller front bumpers and a convertible top patterned after the one from the Herald completed the exterior differences. On the interior the fly-off handbrake lever was moved to the transmission tunnel between two revised seats, the gearshift lever was shortened and the white painted steel dashboard was now always covered by walnut, which had been optional in the TR4. In 1965 the TR4A IRS sold in the UK for approximately ¬£968. Wire wheels added ¬£36, overdrive ¬£51, heater ¬£13 and seat belts ¬£4 each;.Autocar Magazine, 28 May 1965  Coachwork  The TR4A continued to offer the \\"Surrey Top\\" hard top system as an option. This weather protection system comprises a rigid rear back light, a removable rigid roof panel and a soft fabric panel that was the actual surrey-top. The back light is attached to the rear of the passenger area semi-permanently. Either the roof panel or the soft surrey top bridge the gap between the top of the windshield surround and the top of the back light. This aesthetically foreshadowed the silhouette of Targa top cars.  Non-IRS  In response to requests from United States distributors Bud Forman and Les Genser Triumph developed a version of the TR4A fitted with a TR4-style rear live axle and made IRS an extra-cost option for that market. To locate the newly re-introduced leaf springs, spring brackets were added to the revised chassis. Live axle cars received a commissioning number (Triumph did not use serial numbers) that started with \\"CT\\". This was the same prefix used for TR4s. IRS equipped cars' commissioning numbers began with \\"CTC\\". The price in the United States was just under $2500.  Motorsports  Even though the SCCA declined to homologate the TR4A in 1965, Kas Kastner, Triumph's US Competition Manager, and his modified \\"Super Stock\\" TR4A were able to win a D-modified National Championship in 1965 at Daytona with driver Charlie Gates.http://www.kaskastner.com/feb66.pdf Bob Tullius' Group 44 and others successfully campaigned these cars during the 1965 to 1973 seasons, accumulating a respectable collection of finishes. The apex of the TR4A's racing history is the team win by three TR4A IRS models at the Sebring 12-hour race of 1966, finishing 1st, 2nd and 3rd in their class.  Successor  In 1968 the TR4A's venerable four-cylinder engine was replaced by Triumph's 2.5-litre straight-6. In the UK and most other markets it was equipped with Lucas fuel injection and called the TR5. In the United States price pressure and tighter emissions standards resulted in an otherwise identical but much less powerful car being fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetters, called the TR250.

Life and career B√©naz√©raf was born in Casablanca, French Morocco on January 8, 1922. After completing his studies in political sciences, he started his film career in 1958 producing Les lavandi√®res du Portugal, a film by Pierre Gaspard-Huit, and went on to direct and write numerous erotic films in the 1960s. He started to direct erotic feature films in 1961 with L'√©ternit√© pour nous. At the end of the 1970s, he moved his attention to the direct-to-video market. He died in Chiclana de la Frontera. Views on filmmaking In 1973, B√©naz√©raf stated he did not make message films, and that one of the reasons he made films was to \\"disturb the French\\" (French: \\"d√©ranger les Fran√ßais\\"), who were, he felt, not disturbed by anything, neither politically nor sexually. B√©naz√©raf also said that he attempted \\"to poeticise eroticism\\" (French: po√©tiser l'√©rotisme), whereas many at that time tended to accentuate pornography. He found pornographic films \\"horribly sad\\" (French: \\"horriblement triste\\") and called them \\"anti-eroticism\\" (French: \\"anti-√©rotisme\\"). According to B√©naz√©raf, eroticism was something \\"which creates a climate, which creates, which awakes, which sublimises desire\\" (French: \\"qui cr√©e un climat, qui cr√©e, qui suscite, qui sublimise le d√©sir\\"), and the effect of pornography was the opposite.

All eleven players in a team are required to bat if the innings is completed (i.e., if the innings does not close early due to a declaration or other factor). The batting order is colloquially subdivided into: * Top order (batters one to three) * Middle order (batters four to eight; which can also be divided into:) ** Upper Middle order (batters four and five) ** Lower Middle order (batters six and seven) * Tail Enders (batters nine to eleven) The order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established before the start of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities; the position each batter is most comfortable with; each player's skills and attributes as a batter; possible combinations with other batters; and the match situation whereby, for example, the team may require a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the innings. Also, a middle order batter in Tests may open for ODIs and Twenty20 due to their controlled approach to the game. Changing the batting order The captain of the team can change the batting order during the game at his or her discretion. They can even change the batting line-up from one game to another in a tournament or series. There are no rules about the nature or number of changes made and, if more than one innings is played, the order used in each need not be the same. It has even been known for a captain to completely reverse his batting order for the second innings after following on. This has made it possible for a bowler to take a hat-trick across three consecutive overs of a match, including the same batsman twice.Cricinfo Ask Steven Column ‚Äì see the last question ‚Äì retrieved 16 November 2006. There are various reasons why the captain might make a change from the established order. Usually, however, captains and coaches prefer not to adjust the batting order unless necessary, as for example when South Africa moved Imran Tahir up the order against India because the South African top 7 batsmen were poor against spin bowlers, a plan which backfired spectacularly. In 2017, Faf du Plessis, who returned to the side as Test Captain after paternity leave, decided to make many changes to the batting lineup before the second test against England after being handed a heavy defeat. Du Plessis replaced JP Duminy at no. 5, and moved Quinton de Kock from 5 to 4 (de Kock already moved from no. 7 to 5 between the 1st and 2nd innings of the first Test), and due to the suspension of Kagiso Rabada due to demerit points, so Duanne Olivier replaced him, Philander moved up a spot to no. 7, while Theunis de Bruyn was replaced by Chris Morris at no. 8. =Pinch hitter= If the state of the game requires runs to be scored quickly, a captain will often promote a batter who is known to score quickly up the order. This is usually a lower-order batter, as their wicket is not regarded as being so valuable. A batter who is promoted up the order with the intention of scoring quick runs is called a pinch hitter or slogger. Some examples of a pinch hitter would be David Miller, Glenn Maxwell, Shahid Afridi & Thisara Perera. =Nightwatchman= When a wicket falls near the end of the day, a lower order (less capable) batter might be sent in to bat with the intention that the more capable players will be held in reserve until the next morning. The more capable players are then not exposed to the risk of dismissal while tired or in low-light conditions. The batter who is sent in is known as the nightwatchman. This tactic is also used because players are typically nervous and unsettled at the start of the innings before settling into their rhythm and becoming \\"set\\". Sending a specialist batter in late in the day means that he or she will have to survive one such period in the afternoon, before doing the same again after the resumption of play the next day, increasing the chance of a dismissal, so a less valuable batter is sent in instead. Opening batsmen The opening batsmen or openers are the batters who bat first in the innings (no. 1 and 2). This position is important as the openers need to get the innings off to a good start. The early fall of wickets can have a psychological impact on the rest of the team, affecting their performance with the bat. The opening batters also get the first experience of the pitch and conditions, and must be able to adjust to them quickly. Most importantly, the opening batters must face a new ball, which is hard and has a pronounced seam. This makes it more liable to travel fast, bounce high, seam around (i.e., bounce unpredictably off the seam) and swing (i.e., deviate sideways when travelling through the air). These early conditions favour the bowling team, so the opening batters must have considerable patience, a sound technique and be good defensively. As the ball gets older, its condition starts to favour the batting team. Therefore, the openers will ideally stay at the crease long enough to protect the batters further down the order. In first-class cricket, the rate at which the openers score runs is not as important as \\"taking the shine off\\" the new ball. This is the process of softening and roughening the cricket ball, whose condition tends to degrade the longer it is in play. By occupying the crease for a long time and taking the shine off the ball, the openers themselves are able to score more freely later on. This also makes batting easier for the rest of the order. Because of the defensive technique required early on, openers are sometimes less fluent stroke-players than the specialist batters who follow. In limited overs cricket, the role of opening batter is slightly different. In this type of cricket a high run rate is a necessity. Also, in the early 1990s, fielding restrictions were introduced in the early overs of the game, limiting the fielding side to only two players on the boundary. To start the innings effectively and take advantage of the fielding restrictions, it became beneficial to have an aggressive batsman opening the innings. If an opening batter remains not out at the end of the team's innings, after all 10 other batters have been dismissed, he or she is said to have carried the bat. Top Order The top order is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 1, 2, and 3. The batsmen who bat at positions 3, 4 and 5 in the order are sometimes the most technically proficient batsmen with the best stroke play. As they are likely to face an older ball that is easier to score runs against, they must aim to make a large number of runs. They may be exposed to the new ball if an opener loses his wicket early on and so must be equipped to deal with this scenario as well. Top and middle order batsmen must also be adaptable as they may be required to attack, consolidate or defend according to the needs of the team as the match situation develops. The world's most prolific and best recognised batsmen are generally found in the top order. Middle Order The middle order is typically defined as the batsmen batting at positions 4, 5, 6 and 7. It usually consists of versatile batters who must continue to build an innings. The middle order batter is likely to be facing a much older ball bowled by a spin bowler and defensive technique is necessary to overcome this type of attack, but they are often also fleet-footed players who attack slow bowling by charging down the pitch. The middle order players must also be adept at making runs when playing with the poor quality batters in the lower order. This requires the ability to manipulate the strike so that the tail-enders are shielded from the more potent bowlers. Players who are designated as a all-rounder often bat in the middle order (e.g., Garfield Sobers usually batted at number 6; by contrast, W. G. Grace always opened the innings). wicket-keepers generally bat in the middle order as well, often at number 6 or 7 (e.g. Adam Gilchrist throughout his Test career usually batted at number 7; however he predominantly opened the batting in limited-overs cricket). One reason for placing all-rounders and wicket-keepers in the middle-order even though they may be more skilled than those who batted above them was because such players would be tired after bowling or keeping wicket during the preceding innings. Another reason, with the trend of wicket-keepers opening the innings in limited-over cricket, batsmen at positions 6, 7 and 8 tend to be at the crease when the first or second new ball is due, so they can function just like an opener and know how to wear out the new ball, or play aggressively to score quick runs to chase victory or to build the innings quickly towards a declaration. It is also plausible to see substitute wicket-keepers batting at number 5 or 6. In One Day International cricket, middle order batters are generally able to change their game depending on the conditions. If their team loses wickets early, they must be able to play a long careful innings. Conversely, if they are not required to bat until later in the game, they must be able to attempt to score quickly, often attempting to hit many fours or sixes, and if they only have a short period to bat, they are expected to be innovative and able to settle after a short period. In run-chases they are required to be good at calculating and minimising the risks needed to reach the target, by scoring at close to the rate required. If they score more quickly than is required, they run the risk of getting out and exposing the weaker, lower-order batsmen to the pressure situation, but if they score too slowly, then they fall behind schedule and the pressure again increases. Lower order or tail The lower order is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 8, 9, 10 and 11. It is usually made up of players who have average or poor batting skills, commonly known as tailenders (tail ender or tail-ender). These players are the team's specialist bowlers and sometimes the wicketkeeper, or even players on debut if their batting abilities are unproven because bowlers with better batting abilities, aspiring all-rounders or wicketkeepers do have a chance to move up the order over the course of their careers (notably Steve Smith moved from 8 to 3‚Äì5, and Ashton Agar moved from 11 to 7 in first-class cricket). However, some bowlers do establish themselves as competent lower order batters, especially at no. 8 where many bowlers become bowling all-rounders, as in the case of fast bowlers Wasim Akram and Jason Holder who, both, have a double Test century each to their names. By the same token, opening batters could move down the order due to poor form, having a top-heavy line-up or being better suited to play against spin bowling (notably Moeen Ali moving down from an opener to no. 7, or even 8, since 2015 Ashes series, but has since also played at 3 in 2018). Therefore, the start of the lower order may vary in position depending on the balance of the side in terms of overall batting capability. Also, given that batters in ODIs and Twenty20 need to score quickly and aggressively, an opener in limited-over forms of the game may bat down the order in tests. It is likely that these batters will be dismissed for low scores. However, as expectations of these players are low when they are batting, they often play aggressive, carefree shots in the hope of scoring as many runs as possible. On occasion, the scores posted by the lower order have made a difference to the outcome of a match. If a significant contribution has come from the tail-enders, it is often said that \\"the tail wagged\\". On occasions in which the batting team is a long way behind its opponents, the lower-order batters may attempt to salvage a draw by playing defensively until the end of the match. An example of this would be the first test in the 2009 Ashes series, in which England bowlers James Anderson and Monty Panesar were able to remain at the crease for 11.3 overs, denying Australia the chance to win the match. The last batter in the order (at position 11) is sometimes referred to as Last Man Jack, a term that has passed into everyday parlance.

It is a companion to the Angel episode \\"Darla\\", which aired later on the same night on The WB network; both episodes include multiple flashbacks to the history of Spike and Darla, shown from their respective viewpoints. After a common vampire nearly kills her with her own stake, Buffy turns to Spike to learn how other Slayers met their end so as not to make further mistakes. Plot synopsis Buffy receives a serious stab wound while fighting a run-of-the-mill vampire at the cemetery; she is saved only by the unexpected arrival of Riley. Despite his encouragement that she is not losing her edge, Buffy wants to research ways to avoid making more mistakes. She and Giles start looking in the Watcher diaries for information about past Slayers' deaths, but Giles tells her there won't be much information because the Watchers usually also died or found it too painful to recount the incidents. Buffy then remembers they have another witness to Slayers' final battles: Spike. Buffy drags Spike from his crypt, takes him to the Bronze and pays him to tell her about his battles with the two Slayers that he killed. He starts out by describing how he was turned in 1880 London, revealing (to the audience, if not entirely to Buffy) that he was the meek poet William, ridiculed by his peers and rejected by the love of his life, Cecily, who declared him \\"beneath her,\\" before Drusilla sired him and took him with her to travel Europe with her sire Angelus (Angel sans soul) and his sire/paramour Darla. Spike further describes how, mere months later, he became far more assertive, already using his new name \\"Spike,\\" speaking in a more forceful, working class accent, and preying upon innocents not for sustenance but for fun, calling too much attention to the group as far as Angelus was concerned. Angelus preferred meticulous, artistic kills, and Spike's love of brawls and riots required them to flee London. Spike mocked Angelus's attitude, and the older vampire lost control, almost staking him, but Spike only laughed at having provoked Angelus to such an extent. Infuriated, Angelus remarked that maybe one day an angry crowd would teach Spike the folly of his excesses, adding \\"That...or the Slayer,\\" a comment which instantly intrigued Spike. In the present, Spike reveals that, upon learning of the Slayer, he became obsessed with her; unlike other vampires, who feared the Slayer, Spike actively sought her out, craving the challenge she would provide. Meanwhile, Riley, Xander, Willow and Anya take over Buffy's patrol. Riley is very methodical, but the rest of the Scoobies are rather lax about the process. They do discover a nest of vampires, including the one that injured Buffy. They make plans to destroy it the next day when the vampires won't be active. Back at the Bronze, Spike tells of killing the Chinese Slayer during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, defeating her after a long and brutal fight, describing her as \\"all business\\" and getting nostalgic about how Drusilla was excited afterward, calling the event \\"the best night of my life\\" (much to Buffy's disgust). Spike also points out that while the Slayer can kill thousands of demons and vampires, all it takes to kill her is for one of them to have one lucky day. Riley, rather than waiting for daylight, goes back to the vampire lair at night, stakes the vampire who wounded Buffy and then firebombs the crypt, killing the others. Spike's reminiscences continue as he discusses his second Slayer kill (Nikki Wood), whom he describes as more improvisational like Buffy, and whom he killed on a New York City Subway about 1977. After he finishes, he reveals that he won by exploiting the Slayers' curiosity about ‚Äì and wish for ‚Äì death, further claiming that every Slayer has a death wish, including Buffy herself. Buffy rejects his conclusion and becomes angry and disgusted when Spike comes on to her, trying to kiss her and challenging her to prove him wrong. Knocking him to the ground, Buffy, echoing Cecily, contemptuously informs Spike that he is \\"beneath her\\" before walking away. Spike's feelings of sadness and humiliation, which cause him to briefly succumb to tears, are quickly overtaken by anger and frustration. He arms himself with a double-barreled shotgun at his crypt, determined to kill Buffy for this insult. When she gets home, her mother reveals that she needs to go into the hospital for some more tests, and that her condition may be serious. Unable to bear this information, Buffy retreats to the back porch in tears. At that moment, Spike approaches with his shotgun, but Buffy's distraught state changes his mind and he attempts to comfort her instead. He takes a seat next to her and gently pats her on the back, an action that Buffy does not rebuff, though her shock is clear. Continuity In the flashback to London in 1880, according to a partygoer Spike was known as William the Bloody because of his \\"bloody awful poetry.\\" Giles had noted that Spike was at one time known as William the Bloody in the season 2 episode School Hard.

Her musical style is eclectic and often blends elements of afrobeat, art rock, post-punk, classical, new-wave and electronic. Her debut album Bone of My Bones was released to positive reviews in 2009. Recorded in India, her second album, Behold, a Pale Horse was released in September 2013, to critical acclaim. Her third album Nephilim went out in 2018.  Music career  Ebony Bones was named by her original drummer Rat Scabies, of band The Damned. Known for her on-stage antics and theatrical costumes, she opened for Cee Lo Green's 2011 Tour across the UK and Europe. Beginning as a self-taught musician performing under the stage name 'Ebony Bones!', she anonymously uploaded music onto a blank Myspace page. Scabies encouraged her to also produce her own records : \\"I was very determined to carve out my own sound and not kind of have the pressure of someone else dictating to me what that should be\\". Writing and producing her own material, \\"We Know All About U\\", depicting an Orwellian society, made its radio d√©but as \\"The Hottest Record in the World Today\\" as well as \\"Single of the Week\\" on BBC Radio 1 by DJ Zane Lowe, also receiving daytime play from Jo Whiley, becoming Radio 1's most played single by an unsigned artist. Her d√©but album Bone of My Bones was released in 2009 and hailed by critics. It included the tracks W.A.R.R.I.O.R and Guess We'll Always Have NY, later used for campaigns by Yves Saint Laurent, EA Sports FIFA 11 soundtrack, and a controversial Citro√´n car commercial featuring John Lennon, which was later banned in parts of Europe. In 2010 she was requested to perform live at the Shanghai World Trade Show Expo 2010, Central Park SummerStage in New York, and The Grand Palais in Paris for SFR live concerts. In the summer of 2011 Ebony Bones also debuted new material from her second album at The Cannes Film Festival and T-Mobile International Film Festival. In 2013, Bones released her second album Behold, A Pale Horse: it was partly conceived while travelling in India. The record featured the Symphony Orchestra of India and a cover of The Smiths. Behold, A Pale Horse was critically acclaimed and received good reviews by the likes of The Independent, and Spin. Bones decided to create and run her own label, titled \\"1984 Records\\". She has released a majority of her works on this album, such as her EP titled \\"Bread & Circus Pt. 1\\". She later released another EP titled, Milk & Honey, Pt. 1 in October 2015. In 2015, Bones collaborated with Yoko Ono on Ono's remix album Yes, I'm A Witch Too: the track \\"No Bed For Beatle John\\" was a remix of an older song. In July 2018, she released Nephilim; PopMatters hailed it in an 8 out of ten review saying: \\"It is a case of progression and evolution, and Ebony Bones has achieved a big leap forward with Nephilim. Looking back at her albums it's clear that her work in Bones of My Bones and Behold, A Pale Horse, have been a preparation for this moment. Nephilim finds Bones at her best, with a vision that spreads wider, but also with a more focused demeanor.\\"Stasis, Spyros. \\"Ebony Bones Nephilim review\\". PopMatters. Retrieved 12 August 2018 Musical influences and artistry On her MySpace, Bones cited in her influences singers of all genres such as Fela Kuti, Grace Jones, The Slits, Siouxsie Sioux and Public Enemy. Bones also said: \\"Lauryn Hill is phenomenal. I also like very much Siouxsie and the Banshees, Annie Lennox and Missy Elliott\\". Her music has been described as \\"a modern-minded mash-up of early punk slammed against the sounds of old-school afro-beat icons\\". Her style was described as \\"idiosyncratic\\" and as boasting \\"an especially unique and commanding kind of groove\\". The Guardian said that Bones created a \\"unique brand of post-punk mantra-disco\\".  Acting career  Attending London's Sylvia Young Theatre School alongside classmate Amy Winehouse, it is known that Ebony Thomas began her career at the age of 12, when she was spotted by BAFTA award winning actor and artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Mark Rylance, for his production of Macbeth also starring actress Jane Horrocks. Nominated for The British Soap Awards in 2004 and 2005 for playing the role of Yasmin Green on the Channel 5 TV drama Family Affairs, she was one of the programme's youngest and longest-serving cast members.

First described in the later 19th century, the only other species are known from fossil specimens. They are similar in appearance to potoroos and bettongs, but are not as closely related. Their omnivorous diet is known to include materials such as fruit and fungi, as well as small animals such as insects and other invertebrates. The local Aboriginal name for the species is durrgim yuri.  Taxonomy  The description of this species, assigned to a new genus Hypsiprymnodon, was published in 1876 by Edward Pierson Ramsay, a curator at the Australian Museum. The syntypes are part of the museum's collection, mounted specimens of a male and female collected at Rockingham Bay, Queensland. Ramsay's specimens were obtained during European settlement of northeastern Australia on an expedition toward the Herbert River. A description of the species was provided by Richard Owen in the year after Ramsay's publication, the name Pleopus nudicaudatus, describing the five toes of the hind foot and its scaly, naked tail, is now regarded as a synonym. Ramsay had provisionally assigned the species to the genus Hypsiprymnus, but in his review of the dentition he proposed to separate them to a new genus. Hypsiprymnodon moschatus has been placed with the subfamily Hypsiprymnodontinae of the family Potoroidae, the most recent classificationplaces it in the family Hypsiprymnodontidae with prehistoric taxa. The specific epithet is derived from Latin term moschatus, meaning musky. The description as a new species of 'rat-kangaroo' was the last of the 19th century, bringing the total to nine species, and no other new species would be formally described for another 90 years.  Description  Hypsiprymnodon moschatus is the smallest species of the macropod order, weighing around 500 grams. The total length of the head and body is 155 to 270 millimetres, the weight range 360 to 680 grams. Sexual dimorphism is not readily apparent in this species, although the females may be slightly larger. They have a long black tail, measuring from 125 to 160 mm. The appearance of the tail is scaly, rather than hairy, and proportionally shorter than the length of the head and body. Their ears are also nearly hairless and appear leathery. The pelage is a uniform, deep and rich brown colour with reddish highlights over most of the body, the head and lower parts are somewhat greyish. The dark and chocolatey colour of the fur distinguish them from the other living 'rat-kangaroos'. A steel grey colour at the head grades into the rich brown of the body. The feet of H. moschatus are blackish and, uniquely among the macropods, have five toes at the hind foot. A band of white, variously slight to distinct, appears from the belly toward the throat. The animal emits a noticeable musky odour. Dentition of the species resembles that of the extant potoroids, but for that family's incisor formula of I3/1. The dental formula of H. moschatus is I3/2 C1/0 PM1/1 M4/4. Two premolars found in juveniles are replaced at maturity when a single sectorial premolar erupts. The sequence of emerging molars and premolars allows the age of the individual to be determined. Hypsiprymnodon moschatus have a fine and delicate skull structure with a rostrum that is narrow and elongate. A long nasal bone structure and distance between the canine and premolar teeth is large. Distribution and habitat  The species only occurs in the northeastern part of the continent. They may be locally common in remaining areas of extensive rainforest and can occur at high and low elevations. The distribution range extends from west of Ingham, Queensland at Mt. Lee to Mt. Amos south of Cooktown. They are found in low altitude rainforests, such as Cape Tribulation and Mission Beach, and within the montane habitat of the Carbine, Atherton and Windsor tableland regions. The population density of H. moschatus is from 1.40 to 4.50 animals per hectare.  Behaviour  A usually solitary animal that is only active during the day, distinguishing them from the nocturnal habits of the rat-kangaroos in the Potoroidae family. They are most active in the morning and afternoon, retiring to their shelter during the middle of the day. They are mostly terrestrial, foraging at the forest floor, although they are able to move through the branches of the lower vegetation. A nest is roughly constructed at a site where the animal shelters while sleeping. Observations of the behaviour within its dense habitat presented difficulties to early field work, however, the use of a thread, lightly glued to the animal and fed from a spool, allowed the activity and range of males and females to be more accurately evaluated. The individual ranges overlap in both their both foraging and nest site. Males may venture out in a range from 0.8 to 4.2 hectares, while females are recorded foraging over a smaller sized area of up to 2.2 ha. Although they are usually solitary in the activities, several may gather to feed at fallen fruit. Their omnivorous diet comprises fruits and fungi along with some insects and other invertebrates, found among the leaf litter and lower storey of the rainforest. The composition of the diet has been described as omnivorous, perhaps with reduced capacity for the carnivory of some fossil species of propleonines, but other records suggest the diet is largely frugivorous. Aggressive behaviours between males may be displayed during the austral spring and summer months, vigorously pursuing each other for around 30 seconds. The male's encounters, sometimes in competition for fruit, increase in frequency during breeding months; physical interactions between the males are restricted to striking with the front paw. Reproductive activity is mostly from October to April, the usual litter size is two offspring. The newborns travel in the pouch of the mother for about 21 weeks, and then are left at the nest while the mother forages until the juveniles are fully weaned. The earliest records note that the animal was elusive and discreet in its nature, and that specimens were difficult to obtain. Regular activity is conducted on all four limbs, but unlike the bettongs and potoroos, the musky rat-kangaroo bounds using all its paws when moving rapidly. This resembles the characteristic hopping of a rabbit more than that of its macropod relations. It moves by extending its body and then bringing both of its hind legs forward, and uses an opposable toe on the hind foot to climb trees.  Ecology  A number of parasitic species are presumed to be associated with H. moschatus, including internal organisms such as roundworm and tapeworm species and ectoparasites such as ticks, mites, lice and fleas; the identified species of mites (Acari) are those of genera Mesolaelaps and Trichosurolaelaps. Musky rat-kangaroos have been protected from many of the threatening factors that greatly reduced the potoroine species, and their rainforest habitat has in part remain secluded and conserved. The species remains vulnerable to fragmentation of the population by land clearing, which disrupts the ability to recolonise and increases genetic isolation, Their role in seed dispersal within their range is likewise important to the ecology of their tropical rainforest habitat. By carrying a fleshy fruit away to be consumed, or pressing them into earth as a cache, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus gives advantage to the plant's potential for recruitment. This interaction between plants and mammal has been compared to those on other continents, such as the squirrels and agoutis, and posited as an example of convergent evolution. The lack of size difference in the sexes corresponds to a limited home range for males, the inability to range beyond the female also allows greater attention to sexual competitors. The high level of overlaps in range of a local populous allows high population densities.  Systematics  A musky rat-kangaroo A musky rat-kangaroo near Kuranda, Queensland, Australia After the first description of the species, the musky rat-kangaroo was allied to various familial relationships. Later revisions have strongly indicated deep divergence from the extant potoroid marsupials, Bettongia and Potorous, and separated at the family level as Hypsiprymnodontidae. The discovery of fossil specimens has revealed a more widespread and diverse lineage in Miocene Australia.

The Criminal Law Act 1967 introduced the category to replace the ancient term felony. That Act had been superseded by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which over the next two decades was itself significantly amended to increase police powers of arrest, relating in particular to entry, search following arrest and to custody. In England and Wales, the category \\"arrestable offence\\" ceased to exist with the advent on 1 January 2006 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act.s.110Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005 , SI2005/3495, art.2(1)(m) In Northern Ireland, it ceased to exist with the advent of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007. In the Republic of Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1997 abolished the terms felony and misdemeanour and created the term \\"arrestable offence\\" in their place.Section 3, Criminal Law Act 1997Section 2, Criminal Law Act 1997 England and Wales=Definition= Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 defined an arrestable offence as: * An offence for which the sentence is fixed by law; e.g. murder. * Offences for which a person 18 years old or older, who had not previously been convicted, could be sentenced to a term of 5 years or more. This constituted the vast majority of offences, including rape, theft, serious assault, burglary and criminal damage. * Offences that were listed in Schedule 1A of the Act, which contained a long list of offences that do not attract a 5-year sentence but were considered to require the powers an 'Arrestable Offence' designation confers. Examples included possession of an offensive weapon, ticket touting and driving whilst disqualified. =Other arrest powers= In addition to being able to arrest for an arrestable offence as defined above, section 25 provided further powers of arrest for \\"non-arrestable offences\\" in certain circumstances. This had no equivalent in the original 1967 legislation. They were as follows:section 25 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as at 31.12.2005 # that the name of the relevant person is unknown to, and cannot be readily ascertained by, the constable, # that the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name furnished by the relevant person as his name is his real name, # that: ## the relevant person has failed to furnish a satisfactory address for service, or ## the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether an address furnished by the relevant person is a satisfactory address for service, # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to prevent the relevant person: ## causing physical injury to himself or any other person, ## suffering physical injury, ## causing loss of or damage to property, ## committing an offence against public decency (where members of the public going about their normal business cannot reasonably be expected to avoid the person to be arrested), or ## causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway, # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the relevant person. =Replacement= With the increasing number of newly created offences being included in Schedule 1A and thus being made arrestable, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 abolished the category of arrestable offence, replacing the dual rules with a single set of criteria for all offences. The question now for police is whether it is \\"necessary\\" to arrest the relevant person, by reference to various broadly-drafted statutory criteria. The general arrest conditions are:and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Section 24 # that: ## the name of the relevant person is unknown to, and cannot be readily ascertained by, the constable, ## the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name furnished by the relevant person as his name is his real name, # that: ## the relevant person has failed to furnish a satisfactory address for service, or ## the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether an address furnished by the relevant person is a satisfactory address for service, # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to prevent the relevant person: ## causing physical injury to himself or any other person, ## suffering physical injury, ## causing loss of or damage to property, ## committing an offence against public decency, or ## causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway, # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the relevant person. # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the person in question, or # that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to prevent any prosecution for the offence from being hindered by the disappearance of the person in question. Northern Ireland=Definition= Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 defined an arrestable offence as: * An offence for which the sentence was fixed by law; i.e. murder. *an offence for which a person of 21 years of age or over (not previously convicted) may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years (or might be so sentenced but for the restrictions imposed by Article 46(4) of the Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981), and *offences that were listed in that Article of the Order. A constable may also have arrested for an offence if the conditions of Article 27 were satisfied. =Replacement= The powers to arrest under the 1987 Order were replaced by near-identical criteria as for England & Wales. A constable may arrest for any offence if the conditions below are satisfied: #to enable the name of the person in question to be ascertained (in the case where the constable does not know, and cannot readily ascertain, the person's name, or has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name given by the person as his name is his real name); #correspondingly as regards the person's address, #to prevent the person in question: ##causing physical injury to himself or any other person, ##suffering physical injury, ##causing loss of or damage to property, ##committing an offence against public decency, or ##causing an unlawful obstruction on a road (within the meaning of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, #to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the person in question, #to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the person in question, or #to prevent any prosecution for the offence from being hindered by the disappearance of the person in question.

He was the son of a tailor, and he obtained his first medical knowledge in the shop of a barber surgeon. When he moved to Paris, he had the good fortune to attract the attention of renowned surgeons Antoine Louis (1723‚Äì1792) and Pierre-Joseph Desault (1744‚Äì1795). Boyer persevered at his profession, and became notorious for his anatomical knowledge and surgical dexterity. At the age of 37 he was appointed second surgeon to the H√¥tel-Dieu in Paris. On the establishment of the √âcole de Sante, he was named chair of operative surgery, but soon exchanged it for the chair of clinical surgery. Boyer specialized in urological pathology, especially disorders of micturition. Boyer was a cautious and finicky physician, not always trusting of new innovations in treatment. He practiced and wrote with skill and sense. His two masterworks are ' (in 4 vols., 1797‚Äì1799), of which a fourth edition appeared in 1815, and ' (in 2 vols., 1814‚Äì1826), of which a newer edition in seven volumes was published in 1844‚Äì1853 with additions by his son, Philippe Boyer (1801‚Äì1858). In 1805, Napoleon promoted Boyer to the status of imperial family surgeon, and, after the successful campaigns of 1806 and 1807, conferred on him the Legion of Honor, with the title of baron of the empire and a salary of 25,000 francs. On the fall of Napoleon, Boyer's merits secured him the favor of the succeeding sovereigns of France, and he was consulting surgeon to Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis Philippe.

Plot synopsis Buffy trains and works on her strength with the help of Giles and some crystals. She practices a handstand on a block of wood, but falls when her sister, Dawn, knocks over the crystals. In the morning, Dawn continues annoying Buffy by emptying the milk carton. Joyce asks Buffy to take Dawn shopping for school supplies, but Riley reminds her they had already made plans. Buffy has to cancel so she can go work with Giles. Giles drives the sisters on their errands, having trouble with the automatic transmission in his new BMW convertible. They spot Willow and Tara heading for the magic shop, and Buffy tells Willow that she's dropping Drama in favor of more slayer training. At the shop, the gang finds the owner dead, killed by vampires. Buffy sends Dawn outside where she encounters a deranged man. He seems to recognize her, saying, \\"You don't belong here.\\" She is upset until Tara comes to keep her company. The gang realizes that a pack of vampires raided the shop for books on how to defeat the Slayer, under Harmony's leadership. Giles admires the shop and its potential for a future business. That night, Dawn is happy to have Xander as her babysitter, until she discovers Anya is coming too. Harmony arrives to challenge Buffy but is disappointed when she's not there. Xander taunts Harmony and her minions from the safety of the house until Dawn mistakenly invites Harmony inside. After Harmony puts up a fight, Xander kicks her out of the house. Harmony later encounters Spike in the graveyard, and the two talk about Harmony's plans to kill the Slayer. While unpacking in their new place, Tara and Willow discuss how Dawn is having a hard time as the outsider of the Scooby Gang. Tara reveals that she has similar feelings as an outsider. On patrol, Buffy is fuming about the lecture she received from her mother about allowing Dawn to see a dead body. Riley tries to talk some sense into her, pointing out she and Dawn resent each other for similar reasons. When they return home, Xander tells Buffy about Harmony and - after the Slayer stops laughing - she gets angry that Dawn invited Harmony inside. Buffy complains to Riley and Xander about the trouble Dawn causes and how she can't always be there to protect her; Dawn listens from the hall and runs outside in tears. Before Anya can bring Dawn back inside, Harmony's vampire minions capture Dawn and attack Anya causing her to be hospitalized. Buffy then runs out to find her sister leaving Xander and Riley to take care of Anya. Harmony explains to her minions that Dawn is bait, meaning they can't eat her. Harmony complains to Dawn about her problems until her mutinous minions attempt to kill them both. Buffy - who had threatened Spike until he revealed Harmony's location - arrives and easily kills most of the minions as Harmony escapes. The Slayer frees her sister and when they get home, they agree not to tell their mother. The next day, Buffy and Giles talk about his decision to take over the magic shop, while Dawn writes in her journal that Buffy still thinks she's a nobody, but she's going to be in for a surprise. Production details When casting the role of Dawn, Sarah Michelle Gellar suggested they take a look at Michelle Trachtenberg. Dawn was originally conceived to be 12 years old,Writer David Fury's commentary for the episode on the season 5 DVD. but after casting Trachtenberg, the writers raised the character's age to 14. However, the first few scripts were still written in the voice of a 12-year-old. Before being cast, Trachtenberg, a fan of the show, had written a letter to Joss Whedon that suggested how she could become a character on Buffy. Michelle Trachtenberg was listed as a guest star in the previous episode. With effect from this episode she has been added to the title credits after Emma Caulfield. =Writing= Writer David Fury says he was \\"given a lot of freedom to develop Dawn\\" as her background was completely unknown. He set up her relationships with other characters, such as Willow's status as Dawn's \\"Favorite Aunt\\", and provided additional backstory that‚Äîalthough not necessarily appearing in the finished script‚Äî\\"infused her character in future episodes.\\" =Cultural references= * When Buffy complains about having to take Dawn shopping, she notes that you can't buy school supplies at the Magic Box. Dawn adds that she's \\"not going to Hogwarts\\". * Willow and Tara discuss ways to help make Dawn feel more accepted in the gang, Willow jokingly suggests that all of them should wear matching rings to show that they are members, a direct reference to the Legion of Super-heroes, where all its members wear the same Legion flight ring. In later episodes Willow uses powers that are the same as that of some members of the Legion, lightning from Lightning Lad, magnetism manipulation from Cosmic Boy, a force field, from Brainiac 5, to fend off Glory and the Byzantium soldiers and the last episode of Season 5 where Willow uses telepathy, same as Saturn Girl, to contact Spike. *Buffy makes a joke to Giles about a magic shop owner ‚Äúhaving the same life expectancy as a Spinal Tap drummer.\\" Continuity=Arc significance= * Giles decides to buy the Magic Box, which will be a frequent setting in seasons 5‚Äì6. * Dawn is introduced and shown to have a crush on Xander, which is eventually requited in Season 8. * The first example is shown of someone \\"outside reality\\" (i.e., crazy) seeing Dawn as not human, but as a ball of energy (the Key).

Originally completed in 1959 at the cost of $2.5 million, the it has undergone numerous renovations and expansions. TheCharleston Coliseum & Convention Center currently consists of three main components: the Civic Center Coliseum, the Little Theater, and the Charleston Convention Center, also referred to as the Grand Hall. History In 1953, the first in a series of general obligation bonds was approved by city voters for the construction of a civic center in the downtown area of Charleston, West Virginia between Lee Street and Quarrier Street on the banks of the Elk River just before the Elk River empties into the Kanawha River. When the original Civic Center opened in January 1959 at the cost of $2.5 million, it consisted of a 6,000-seat arena and the 750-seat \\"Little Theater.\\" The Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center underwent its first renovation and expansion in 1964 when 2,400 additional seats were added to the arena and a paved parking lot and an ice rink were added to the facilities. The $1.5 million project was financed through the sale of revenue bonds. The most significant renovation and expansion began when city voters approved a $10 million general obligation bond sale in 1976 to erect a 13,000-seat coliseum, a two-story lobby that connected the new coliseum with the original arena and theater, and remodel the original arena into a convention center. The project also received an additional $10 million in federal matching grants and was completed in 1980. Two parking garages were added in 1983, accommodating up to 1,300 cars. In 1994, the Grand Hall of the convention center received a new ceiling, paint and lighting and the ice rink was also converted into an exhibit hall in the 2001. The last renovations took place between 2004 and 2006 when about $250,000 was spent to renovate the Little Theater. After Pride Youth Programs' annual anti-drug convention in early 2007, Jay DeWispelaere, CEO of Pride Youth Programs, commented on what he felt were the inadequacies of the Charleston Civic Center. In May 2015, the Charleston's Municipal Planning Commission approved the permit need to move forward with a planned comprehensive expansion and renovation, expected to cost around $72 million. Construction began in September 2015, with an expected completion date in early 2018. The Civic Center will remain open during construction. As part of a 10-year sponsorship deal with the organization, the Charleston Civic Center's new basketball court (which debuted in the 2011-12 season) is branded with a large logo for Friends of Coal, a locally based political advocacy group. Events The Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center is a venue for a number of annual events and fairs throughout the year. Among the events includes Annual West Virginia Hunting and Fishing Show, West Virginia Association of Fairs & Festivals Conference, West Virginia International Auto Show, West Virginia Sports Show, the Taste of Charleston, and the Capital City Art & Craft Show. Several local high schools hold their proms and graduation ceremonies at the Civic Center. The Civic Center has also hosted local show choir festivals, including the state competition. The Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center also hosts the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals of the annual Mountain East Conference postseason tournament, West Virginia State High School Boys and Girls Basketball Tournaments, music concerts, professional wrestling, and hosted basketball games between in-state rivals West Virginia University and Marshall University until that series ended in 2016. The West Virginia State University also holds its commencement ceremonies in the Coliseum. The Charleston Light Opera Guild conducts performances in the Little Theater throughout the year. The Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center hosted Ray Charles in 1962, Johnny Cash in 1966, Jimi Hendrix with a Chicago in 1969, Led Zeppelin in 1970, The Jackson 5 in 1971, John Denver in 1973, Elvis Presley in 1976, Elton John in 1997 and 2014, Queen in 1980, Aerosmith in 1998, Dave Matthews Band in 1999, Thirty Seconds to Mars with Incubus in 2002, Brad Paisley in 2005, Rascal Flatts in 2007, Taylor Swift in 2009, Miranda Lambert in 2015 and All Elite Wrestling's Dynamite October 30 televised episode in 2019.

It has spread throughout southern Europe both as a weed and cultivated as a garden plant. It has been introduced to the United States as an ornamental where it has become naturalized as a weed of cropland and vacant land, particularly on disturbed ground. The plant grows to a height of , sometimes exceeding , and has white or yellow flowers with a purple centre. In the deeply pigmented centre of the flower, the surface features striations, which have been the subject of controversy about whether they act as a diffraction grating, creating iridescence. The pollinated but unripe seedpods look like oriental paper lanterns, less than an inch across, pale green with purple highlights. The flowers of the Hibiscus trionum can set seed via both outcrossing and self-pollination. During the first few hours after anthesis, the style and stigma are erect and receptive to receive pollen from other plants. In the absence of pollen donation, the style bends and makes contact with the anthers of the same flower, inducing self-pollination. Although outcrossing plants seem to perform better than self-pollinating plants, this form of reproductive assurance might have contributed to the success of H. trionum plants in several environments.  Photonic properties  Initial studies showed that artificial replicas of the flower surface produced iridescence that bees could recognise. Later work suggested that the irregularities of the plant cells and surface resulted in the periodicity of the striations being too irregular to create clear iridescence and thus suggested that the iridescence is not visible to man and flower visiting insects. More recent papers have presented evidence that the flower is both visibly and measurably iridescent, and the striations have been shown to be sufficiently irregular to generate particularly strong scattering of light at short wavelengths, producing weak iridescence and a 'blue halo' (of which the halo is the dominant visible effect). It has also been demonstrated that the blue scattering increases the foraging efficiency of bumblebees in laboratory environments, although it remains unknown whether this effect translates to a meaningful advantage in the field.

Plot synopsis Xander and Anya watch a movie with Buffy and Riley and overhear Xander's drunken parents fighting and yelling upstairs. The next day, the gang looks at a prospective apartment for Xander. He doesn't think he can afford it and this upsets Anya. Giles receives a visit from a demon searching for the Slayer. He later identifies the demon as Toth, only survivor of the Tothric Clan. The gang checks out the city dump in search of the demon and find Spike collecting. The demon hits Xander with light from a rod and knocks him to the ground. He gets to his feet and walks off with the rest of the gang, but then we see that there is another Xander still lying in a pile of trash. The next morning, one Xander awakens at the city dump and then discovers his double upon returning to his house. Spike has put together a Buffy doll from mannequin parts which he uses to practice beating up on. One of the Xanders is very ambitious and gets a promotion at work, signs a lease for the apartment, and sets up a date with Anya. The unconfident Xander watches as all this happens and finally confronts his double. After the two Xanders see each other, the confident Xander talks to Buffy and she makes this a matter of Slayer business. Soaked by the rain, weak Xander goes to Willow and tries to explain that this double is taking over his life. He tells Willow that the double is doing a better job of living his life but then suddenly realizes that his double is going after Anya and that is one thing he won't allow. Anya and the Xander double discuss their future and Anya expresses her fears about not living forever. Giles discovers that the rod Toth used split Xander into two real Xanders, one with weak qualities and the other with strong qualities. He intended to use the rod to split Buffy into two beings. In addition, as the two beings are real and technically one being, the death of one will kill them both. The weak Xander crashes the date between strong Xander and Anya. Both think that the other is a demon and the weak Xander pulls out a handgun he got from Anya's apartment. Buffy tells the doubles the truth about their situation and tries to convince them not to kill each other. Toth appears at the apartment then Buffy and Riley fight and kill him. The two Xanders eventually begin to get along, and their actions become so similar to each other that Giles says Xander is a \\"bad influence\\" on himself. Giles and Willow research and come up with a way to reunite the two Xanders but Anya expresses disappointment over this as she wants both to stick around for a 'sandwich' maneuver, much to the disturbance of the others. Willow ends the spell on the Xanders and makes them one again. While moving Xander into his new apartment, Xander and Riley talk.

The company was also known for Elia Kazan's films that he directed from 1945 to 1976. Around the time that the joint venture with Columbia Pictures Entertainment ended in 1988, LBS began to lose money, and in December 1991, LBS filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a result, the company ended up having to sell between 80 and 85 percent of its assets to its Baywatch distributor partner, the Scotti Brothers' All American Television. In 1997, All American was sold to Pearson plc, and was re-branded as Pearson Television.

The term is generally only applied to larger weapons that would otherwise have a dedicated person or persons loading them. An autoloader, as its name suggests, extracts a shell and propellant charge from the ammunition storage rack/compartment and loads it into a magazine, if the gun has one, or directly into the chamber of the gun if it does not. It can and often does replace a human loader. By automating the loading process, it can streamline and speed up the loading process, resulting in a more effective fighting machine. In addition, by removing the need for one (or more) crew member, the overall size of the vehicle can be reduced, which in turn reduces the amount of surface area that needs to be armored, and thus a vehicle designed to use an autoloader can benefit from a significant decrease in weight and size. Also, because an autoloader can take up less volume inside a tank than a human, it potentially allows for a lower profile, making the tank harder to hit. Autoloaders are mechanical devices, and therefore their reliability depends on how well they are designed, manufactured, and maintained. History Autoloaders were developed at the beginning of World War II. Their first combat use was in \\"tank-buster\\" aircraft such as the 75 mm caliber Bordkanone BK 7,5 cannon-equipped Henschel Hs 129 B-3. Every Soviet- and Russian-derived tank since the T-64 main battle tank has used an autoloader. Their use has been mostly shunned by American and British tanks, despite the American T22E1 medium tank being one of the first tank designs to use an autoloader.Hunnicutt, R. P. Pershing, A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series, 1996, Feist Publications, ., p. 50. Naval In the modern era, autoloading is common on any large (76.2 mm caliber or greater) naval gun. The size of the shells, when combined with the more elaborate autoloading facilities available in the wider spaces of a ship, makes an autoloader much faster than human loaders. For example, the US 5\\"/38 Mark 12 can load about 20 rounds per minute.USA 5\\"/38 (12.7 cm) Mark 12 The Soviet/Russian AK-130 (twin barrel 130 mm), using autoloading, can achieve up to 40 rounds per barrel per minute. The Italian 127 mm/5\\" Compact has similar performance. The largest caliber auto-loading naval rifles were the US 8\\"/55 Mark 16, deployed on the three cruisers of the Des Moines class in the late 1940s, and the 8\\"/55 Mark 71 tested aboard the destroyer USS Hull in the late 1970s. Both weapons achieved a rate of fire of 12 rounds per barrel per minute, compared to 3-4 rounds per minute for the preceding hand-loaded weapons. The advent of jet aircraft, and the rate of fire required to engage them, hastened the adoption of automatic loaders on naval artillery. Development of the loading systems was often problematic, and reliability was seriously compromised in many cases. The US 5\\"/54 Mark 42 was derated from 40 rounds per minute to 34 to improve reliability. The Soviet/Russian AK-130 was so badly delayed that the missile cruiser Kirov (later Admiral Ushakov) was forced to use two older weapons in its place. The US 3\\"/70 Mark 37 actually spent more time in design (13 years) than in service (12 years) due to severe unreliability. These problems are largely of the past and the field has advanced a great deal. Ground vehicles Mobile Gun System autoloader holds up to 18 rounds. =Rate of fire= A modern autoloader for a 120-125 mm caliber weapon in good condition can achieve about 10-12 rounds per minute. This rating may or may not include the time required to bring the gun to the appropriate loading angle (if required) and then bringing it back up to firing angle after loading. The autoloader on the cancelled Object 640 \\"Black Eagle\\" tank was supposed to have up to 15 rounds per minute rate of fire. It is considered atypical to engage more than a few targets per minute in a tank. The autoloader may also have an advantage while travelling over rough terrain that may jar a human loader enough to disrupt his loading cycle. For weapons above 127 mm, the increased weight of the round pushes this issue decisively in favor of the autoloader. For self-propelled artillery with calibers of around 152-155mm, for example, autoloaders can typically achieve 8-12 rounds per minute, while a human loader(s) can typically achieve 4 rounds per minute. For sustained bombardments, this may not be so important. Sustained firing rates for artillery are typically only 1-2 rounds per minute, but the rapid-fire capability is vital to shoot-and-scoot tactics to deliver enough fire and then avoid the rapid counterbattery response provided by modern counterbattery systems. On the other hand, even during sustained bombardment an autoloader could be useful, as the fatigue issues of loading an artillery piece for hours (a 155mm projectile weighs ca. 50 kg) do not affect them. In addition, an artillery piece with an autoloader and powerful fire control system can utilise the multiple rounds simultaneous impact technique, firing several shells with varying propellant charges so all of them land on their targets simultaneously. =Survivability= The most common autoloaders store their ammunition in the turret basket, increasing the possibility of a catastrophic explosion should the armor around the hull or turret be penetrated. More armor protection, and isolation/separation of the ammunition from the crew compartment has traditionally been available in tanks with a human loader, which can decrease the possibility of cook-off, or protect the crew in case of an ammunition explosion. For example, the M1 Abrams was designed to protect the crew from cook-off, which is accomplished by storing the main gun ammunition in a compartment at the rear of the turret. The compartment is separated from the crew by a power-operated armored door, which is only opened for a couple of seconds each time the loader needs to grab another round. The roof of the compartment has blowout panels, are armored against outside attack but much less resistant to pressure from inside, so that if the compartment is penetrated by enemy fire the panels will vent the explosion generated by the ammunition while protecting the crew. Other western designs from the later Cold War era to the present with manual loading have similar protective features. In contrast, the Soviet tanks of the Cold War which employ autoloaders store the ammunition on a carousel in the middle of the crew compartment, where any penetration by enemy fire is likely to incinerate the crew and blow the turret right off the top of the tank (known as the jack-in- the-box effect). However, some newer autoloader designs also store the ammunition in an isolated compartment in the turret bustle, with blowout panels on top and the ramming mechanism underneath or in the middle. This allows for much better crew protection, but is disadvantaged because the loading mechanism located in the ammunition compartment reduces the available space and number of rounds that can be carried considerably compared to a similar sized compartment without machinery. With such a design, the loader crew member can be eliminated, but only half the ammunition can be carried ready, in the compartment with the autoloader. Therefore, such a tank usually stores additional ammo in compartmentalized storage at the bottom of the fighting compartment, like older manual loading tank designs. This storage can be surrounded by water, and compartmentalized to some extent, but the reduced crew must still transfer this ammunition to the autoloader at some point. However, such a design can also allow for the rapid replacement of the autoloader and reloading of the ready ammunition by making the compartment at the rear of the turret a modular component that can be easily replaced with appropriate support equipment, similar to how the US MLRS system is reloaded, but possibly even faster. Another possible advantage is that the door that separates the turret can only be large enough for one round of ammunition to slide through, rather than extending across the entire rear of the turret as in the case of the M1 Abrams - this could save additional mass and reduce the power necessary to operate the door, by using less massive armor for the same level of protection, since it would be part of the turret instead of a sliding component in a heavy frame. The disadvantage of the need to keep most of the ammunition close to the autoloader can be actually turned into an advantage by using an unmanned turret design with a crew capsule. In this case, all the necessary ammunition can be kept in direct access to the autoloader, without affecting the safety of the crew, because the crew compartment is completely separate from the autoloader and ammunition. Modern examples of this design are the Russian T-14 \\"Armata\\" MBT and the Polish PL-01 light tank. =Size= Autoloaders are often implemented in an attempt to save on tank size. The T-64 is an example of this. The current generation of tanks using autoloaders (Russian T-90 and T-14, Japanese Type 90 and Type 10, Chinese Type 98, Korean K2 Black Panther, French Leclerc, Chinese/Pakistani Al-Khalid MBT) all weigh between 45-55 tons. Tanks that do not use autoloaders tend to weigh in the 55-70 ton range (American M1A2 Abrams, German Leopard 2, Indian Arjun, British Challenger 2). = Fatigue reduction = The replacement of the loader and gunner with a commander and driver could allow crewmembers to rotate shifts. This would enable continuous operations on the battlefield. Though in some retrofit cases (Abrams tank for example) there is nothing in the fitting of an autoloader that requires the removal of the loader. In such situations the autoloader frees up the fourth crew-member to support the other three full- time, instead of just part-time when they are not doing their main job.

It is the biggest technical institution of higher education in Russia, with close ties to local industry in the Urals. Its motto, Ingenium Creatio Labor, means \\"brilliance creation work\\".  Overview  USTU has 20 faculties including: Metallurgical, Chemical Engineering, Building Materials, Civil Engineering, Physics and physics engineering, Radio Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Heat Power Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Economics and Management, Military Science, Physical Training, Humanities, Continuing education, and a Graduate school. USTU graduates 3000 engineers annually.  History  USTU was founded in 1920. It was formerly known as Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI). The school has rapidly expanded due to the industrialization program of the Soviet Government, which created a high demand for engineering positions. The USTU was key in providing local industrial enterprises with technical and engineering staff. In the 1940s, though suffering from a shortage of personnel due to World War II, the USTU received a great stimulus for development as the military needed to increase production for new industrial goods from the plants in the Urals. Many industrial plants were moved to the Urals due to the partial occupation of Western Russia by Nazi military forces. After the war, the USTU has kept close ties with the military industry, mostly by preparing a large amount of engineers for military purposes. With the growth of Soviet Economy, the USTU kept expanding. In 1991, however, due to the economical crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it suffered from acute underfunding by the Russian Government. It was not until the mid-1990s that the USTU began to find appreciable non-governmental sources of funding, mostly by means of establishing business ties with local industrial enterprises that survived or arose as result of the economical crisis. Currently, the USTU is preparing to undergo integration with several other universities in Yekaterinburg in order to increase its chances for successful competition with other universities in Russia. In April 2008 it was named after Boris Yeltsin - Yeltsin Ural State Technical University. 02.04.2010 USTU united with USU (Ural State University named after A. M. Gorky) and were named Ural Federal University.

In 1964 26th S-RB was detached from 6th Airborne Division and relocated to Dziwn√≥w on Wolin Island (Baltic Sea). It was restructured and named 1 Samodzielny Batalion Szturmowy (en. 1st Detached Assault Battalion). On October 8, 1993, following an executive order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, the unit was relocated to Lubliniec and transitioned from a battalion to a regiment, which led to its renaming to 1 Pu≈Çk Specjalny (en. 1st Special Regiment) before being changed to 1 Pu≈Çk Specjalny Komandos√≥w (en. 1st Special Commando Regiment) in 1995. Even though the unit's name did not receive its \\"Commando\\" (Komandosow) moniker until 1995, it officially became a Special Operations Forces unit of the Polish Armed Forces following the 1993 executive order; making at the time 1 Pu≈Çk Specjalny the only unit subordinated to the command of the Land Forces branch of the Polish Army while at the same time operating as a Special Forces unit. After twelve years under the command of the Polish Land Forces, the unit transitioned to the Polish Special Forces Command (pl. Dow√≥dztwo Wojsk Specjalnych) along with all other Polish Special Forces units when it was formed in 2007. Finally in 2011 (October 1) for its 50th anniversary, the unit was renamed Jednostka Wojskowa Komandos√≥w which at present is its current name. Within Poland's Armed Forces organization, the unit is referred to by its code number JW4101. Current organization JWK is currently operating under the command of p≈Çk (Col.) Wies≈Çaw Kuku≈Ça.http://archiwalny.mon.gov.pl/pl/artykul/13723 The unit operates with a combat structure comparable to Special Forces Groups, 2nd Commando Regiment and is composed of four Zespo≈Ç Bojowy (English:Squadrons), with a fourth set up by 2016; respectively ZB A, ZB B, ZB C and ZB D. Each of these teams carry the traditions of Polish units from World War II.http://www.tradycje.wp.mil.pl/pl/2_274.html ZB A inherits its traditions from Polski Samodzielny Batalion Specjalny and Batalion Miot≈Ça,http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/11699?t=Komandosi- dziedzicza-tradycje-Miotly- ZB B inherits theirs from the No. 6 Troop (Polish) of the No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and ZB C inherits theirs from Batalion Parasol.

The unit described it as a \\"combination of tradition and modernity\\", with the insignia referring to the legacy of the Polish Home Army, while at the same time bringing in modernity by incorporating the distinctive symbols of partisan & commando forces. The anchor, known as Kotwica, refers to the \\"Poland Fighting\\" symbol of the Polish resistance movement from World War II, which was present on the insignia of Batalion Miot≈Ça (current insignia of JWK's Squadron A), Batalion Parasol (current insignia of JWK's Squadron C) and Batalion Zo≈õka (current insignia of JWK's Sub-Command and Security element); the three reconnaissance battalions from the Polish Home Army. Incorporated in the \\"Kotwica\\" anchor is a dagger, a worldwide-recognizable symbol of the Special Operations Forces and also a nod to the unit's previous insignias both as 1PSK and as JWK. The red color of the emblem refers to the color of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando unit from World War II and its No. 6 Polish Troop also known as the 1st Independent Company, whose Combined Operations recognition badge serves as the current insignia for JWK's Squadron B. The black background of the unit's insignia is a nod to the official color of the Polish Special Forces.http://www.cisiiskuteczni.pl/jestem-komandosem/symbolika Recruitment Candidates wanting to serve in the Regiment must first successfully undertake a basic military training course. They then move on to a three-month ‚ÄúJunior Specialist‚Äù training course. During this phase recruits receive training in close combat, hand to hand combat, fighting with specialised equipment, parachuting, land navigation, weapons handling, basic survival, and several other military-related skills. Troops who successfully complete the second phase then move onto the unit, where they are assigned to Zesp√≥≈Ç Bojowy. Once there, additional training continues (mountain and cold weather training, sniper, Casevac, amphibious operations, etc.). Volunteering soldiers from the unit can receive advanced training in allied countries, most notably the U.S. Army Ranger course. Recent operations The regiment has been quite active in recent years. In 2003, troops were deployed to support NATO operations in the Republic of Macedonia during the Kosovo conflict; a13-man detachment was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Polish support for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In 2006, they had charge of protecting the Polski Kontyngent Wojskowy (Polish Military Contingent) in Pakistan which helped in technical rescue after the Pakistan earthquake. Until 2008, the unit had deployed a 56-man company to Iraq (Iraq War) as part of the Multinational Division Central-South in Diwaniyah. Soldiers fought together with the 5th SFG ODA and were fighting and leading special operations throughout Afghanistan, including the Kandahar Province. Since 2010 JWK compound formed ISAF SOF Task Force 50 which perform special operations like capturing JPEL's, Special Reconnaissance, FID. TF-50 soldiers are operating in Ghazni Province and Paktika (War in Afghanistan). In 2016, JW Komandos√≥w was tasked with training the elite Ukrainian 1st Battalion, 79th Airborne-Assault Brigade, whose soldiers were nicknamed Cyborgs for their famous defense of Donetsk airport in 2014.http://www.defence24.com/597471,polish-airborne-units-based-in-cracow- tasked-with-provision-of-training-for-the-ukrainian-cyborgs Uniform Like all units subordinated to COS-DKWS, JWK personnel wear a MultiCam or Suez (Poland's own version of MultiCam developed around 2007, no longer issued and currently being phased out) uniform while in garrison. For various reasons, they may also wear civilian clothing. Soldiers may also wear a distinctive dark green beret with a badge depicting the Eagle of the Polish Special Forces, though it is not mandatory except for a formal ceremony or with the dress uniform. Apart from Command personnel, all other personnel wear uniforms and berets that bear no name or rank so as to conceal and protect their identities.

It is the successor of Ingersoll Publications and Journal Register Company. The company operated more than 350 multi-platform products in 992 communities. On April 5, 2013, the assets of Journal Register Company and its affiliates were sold to 21st CMH Acquisition Co. The Journal Register Company then became known as 21st Century Media. The company was led by CEO John Paton who openly blogged about the changes he is making to transform Journal Register from a newspaper company to a \\"digital first, print last\\" company. Paton, formerly CEO of ImpreMedia, started on February 1, 2010, by announcing he would provide all reporters with Flip video cameras as a sign of his commitment to the company's digital transformation. On March 17, 2010, the company named an advisory board composed of new media visionary Jeff Jarvis (author of \\"What Would Google Do\\" and BuzzMachine); Jay Rosen of New York University who is currently running the innovative Studio 20 program at NYU and who writes for the website \\"PressThink\\" (Rosen is also a former member of Wikimedia Foundation's advisory board); and Emily Bell, the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. On March 11, 2010, the company named Bill Higginson, Journal Register's former Senior Vice President, Production, as the company's President and COO. On March 4, 2010, the company named Jeff Bairstow as chief financial officer. Bairstow joined Journal Register after working for Synarc Inc., a leading provider of medical imaging analysis, subject-recruitment and biochemical-marker services. In 2013, MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media merged into Digital First Media.  Properties  The company owned daily and weekly newspapers, other print media properties and newspaper-affiliated local Web sites in the U.S. states of Connecticut, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It also operated 3 commercial printing facilities. 21st Century Media's flagship daily newspaper was the New Haven Register. Its ten largest daily newspapers (approximate daily circulation over 20,000) were: * New Haven Register of New Haven, Connecticut (76,664) * The Oakland Press of Pontiac, Michigan (63,174) * Delaware County Daily and Sunday Times of Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania (43,520) * The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens, Michigan (42,045) * The Trentonian of Trenton, New Jersey (Sunday: 26,500) * The News-Herald (Ohio) of Willoughby, Ohio (39,453) * The Daily Local News of West Chester, Pennsylvania (27,087) * The Morning Journal of Lorain, Ohio (26,777) * The Mercury (Pennsylvania) of Pottstown, Pennsylvania (21,080) * Daily Freeman of Kingston, New York (18,492) History In 2004, JRC bought 21st Century Newspapers, gaining ownership of several daily newspapers in Greater Detroit. In 2006, JRC bought the Web site JobsInTheUS.com. It is also a major shareholder in consulting company PowerOne Media. That same year, the company moved its headquarters to Yardley, Pennsylvania from Trenton, New Jersey. In early 2007, JRC completed the sales of its former Massachusetts and Rhode Island newspapers to GateHouse Media and RISN Operations, respectively. In early 2008, the New York Stock Exchange announced it was planning to suspend trading of JRC's common stock. The stock had been below $1.05 for 30 consecutive days, at one point falling to 16 cents, which was the all-time low at that time. The stock was delisted as of April 16. On February 21, 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US Bankruptcy Court, located in Manhattan, New York, NY. On August 12, 2009, JRC emerged from bankruptcy as a private company. On September 5, 2012, Digital First Media, parent company of JRC, confirmed the group had again filed for bankruptcy protection. On April 5, 2013, the assets of Journal Register Company and its affiliates were sold to 21st CMH Acquisition Co., an affiliate of funds managed by Alden Global Capital. The Journal Register Company then became known as 21st Century Media and continued to be managed by Digital First Media.

Watson, M.D. is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel by Nicholas Meyer, published in 1976. It takes place after two of Meyer's other Holmes pastiches, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution and The Canary Trainer, though it was published in between the two. The plot concerns a series of strange murders in London's theatre district at the end of the 19th century. It also includes a first meeting between Holmes and Doctor Moore Agar, whose \\"dramatic introduction to Holmes\\" was one that Watson, in the original Arthur Conan Doyle story \\"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\\", wrote that he \\"may some day recount.\\" The West End Horror made The New York Times Best Seller list for eleven weeks between June 13, 1976 and August 22, 1976.Adult New York Times Best Seller Lists for 1976. Retrieved 23 December 2012. Plot The book is written in the form of a false document. It opens with a foreword by Meyer, who states that the manuscript was brought to his attention by a woman with some familial connection to Horace Vernet, an ancestor of Holmes. The woman had read The Seven-Per-Cent Solution and thought Meyer might be interested. Although damaged by water, the manuscript proved authentic. Dr. Watson explains in his own preface that he did not publish the story because of the number of well-known persons who would be affected - persons whose identity would be impossible to disguise. Holmes had for a long time refused Watson permission to write the story on these very grounds, but Watson eventually persuaded him by promising to place the manuscript in Holmes' hands, the only condition being that he not destroy it. The story involves many well-known people, including George Bernard Shaw, who hires Holmes to look into the death of an unpleasant theatre critic; Sir Arthur Sullivan, one of whose singers at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company was another victim of the murderer; and others including W. S. Gilbert, Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry and Frank Harris. In the novel, Holmes clears the name of a shy Parsee Indian wrongfully accused of murder; in real life Conan Doyle played a significant part in helping George Edalji, a Parsee victim of injustice in the English court.

This episode introduces the character Faith, another vampire slayer, who will become a key player in Sunnydale. While the rest of the gang gets to know Faith, Giles suspects that Faith and Buffy aren't being entirely honest about recent events in their lives. Some new vampires arrive in Sunnydale with their own agendas and a familiar face returns. It was written by David Greenwalt, directed by James A. Contner, and first broadcast on October 13, 1998.  Plot  Kakistos and his colleague, Mr. Trick arrive in town, discussing how they will kill the slayer. Buffy and her mother Joyce attend a meeting with Principal Snyder who reluctantly allows Buffy to return to the school, having been overruled by the school board. Buffy and Willow go to the library, where Giles questions Buffy about what happened the night she killed Angel and defeated Acathla, ostensibly to help him with a binding spell to prevent the demon from being resurrected. That night at the Bronze, fellow student Scott Hope attempts to talk to Buffy, but she becomes distracted by a suspected vampire leading a girl outside. Buffy and the rest of the group watch as the girl kills the vampire. The girl introduces herself as Faith, a new vampire slayer. Cordelia suggests that the death of Kendra the Vampire Slayer must have summoned Faith. The group take a liking to Faith, but Buffy remains skeptical. Kakistos and Mr. Trick plot revenge on Faith for mutilating Kakistos' face. That night, while the slayers are patrolling together, they are attacked by vampires. While Buffy struggles with several vampires, Faith focuses only on one, beating the vampire repeatedly instead of helping Buffy. Giles tells Buffy the vampires were working for Kakistos, an ancient vampire with cloven hands and feet. After leaving the library, Buffy runs into Scott, who tries to ask her out on a date. Buffy accepts, but she runs away very disturbed when Scott hands her a Claddagh ring like the one Angel gave her. Giles tells Buffy that Faith's watcher is dead, not at a retreat center as Faith had said. Buffy goes to see Faith at her motel room and tells her Kakistos is in town. Faith tells Buffy that Kakistos murdered her watcher some weeks earlier in Boston and he swore revenge on her for mutilating him with an axe. As Faith tries to leave, Kakistos and a group of vampires break into the room. Buffy and Faith escape through a window, but are driven into Kakistos lair. Buffy fights and slays many of the vampires while Kakistos attacks Faith. Eventually, Faith impales Kakistos with a large beam, killing him. Mr. Trick flees with another vampire. Inspired by Faith standing up to her fears and conquering them, Buffy finally reveals to Giles and Willow that Angel was cured when she killed him. Although she is skeptical that the information will help with a binding spell, Buffy feels better for having told them. After Buffy leaves, Willow approaches Giles to offer her help with the spell, but Giles tells her that there is no spell, he wanted Buffy to open up about what happened between her and Angel. Buffy talks to Scott and, after explaining her reaction to the ring, they make plans to go out. She returns to the mansion where she killed Angel. Buffy places her Claddagh ring on the ground and says goodbye. After she leaves, the ring starts to vibrate and Angel returns from hell. Writing \\"Faith, Hope, & Trick\\" introduces the minor character Mr. Trick. After Principal Robin Wood and Kendra, he is the longest-running character of color in the series. According to Elyce Rae Helford, in an unusually long speech for such a minor character, he \\"overtly clarifies the racial metaphor underlying the show's narrative by comparing African Americans in Washington, D.C., with vampires in Sunnydale and by conceiving both as equivalent examples of 'darkness.

It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and first broadcast on October 20, 1998. When a boy is found mauled to death on the nights surrounding the full moon Oz is suspected. Buffy has to deal with the fact that Angel is back from Hell, broken and animalistic. Plot The day of a full moon, Xander and Giles learn about a brutal murder in the woods the night before. They discover that Xander had slept through his watch of the werewolf Oz, and that the window in the pen is open. Buffy talks to Mr. Platt, the school psychologist, about her life and begins to open up. On patrol that night, Angel attacks her in the woods. Animalistic, he is no match for Buffy, who chains him up in the mansion. She sees the spot on the floor where she left his ring; it was scorched by Angel's body on his return. Willow, Xander and Cordelia enter the morgue to collect hair samples from the body of the mauled boy. Buffy tells Giles that she had a vivid dream of Angel coming back. Giles explains that time passes differently in demonic dimensions, so any being who manages to return would most likely have been turned into a monster. Buffy wonders if Angel was responsible for the murder; the hair samples were inconclusive. Pete and Debbie sneak into a room to make out. Pete discovers that one of his jars has been emptied and accuses Debbie of drinking its contents. Buffy returns to Mr. Platt's office and pours her heart out, then realizes that he has been mauled to death. Pete yells at Debbie, then transforms into a monster. He tells her that he used to need the substance to turn into the monster, but now only needs to get mad. He begins beating Debbie, then tells her it's her fault for making him mad, turning back into his human form. She forgives him. Oz is no longer suspected, as Mr. Platt was killed during the day. He meets up with Debbie and notices her black eye. Buffy and Willow seek out Debbie, and try in vain to talk sense into her. Meanwhile, Angel breaks free from his shackles, and Pete finds Oz in the library. Pete turns into a monster and starts to beat up Oz for talking to Debbie. The sun sets and the tables are turned when Oz transforms into his werewolf form, Oz becoming evenly matched in strength and begins fighting Pete. Buffy tries to tranquilize Oz, but Debbie pushes the gun away and Buffy ends up shooting Giles. Buffy chases after Pete while Willow and Faith pursue Oz. After a struggle, Faith sedates Oz with a dart. Buffy follows Pete's blood trail, but he finds Debbie first and despite her pleas and attempts to appease him, he kills her. Buffy finds Pete, but he knocks her to the ground and advances threateningly on her. Angel arrives and he and Pete begin fighting; Angel uses the chains that still bind his wrists to kill Pete. Afterwards, he reverts to his human face and calls out Buffy's name before falling to his knees and embracing her in tears. Buffy begins to cry as well, finally accepting that Angel is back. Writing According to Erin Waggoner, \\"Beauty and the Beasts\\" is an example of a Buffy episode that condemns aggressive masculinity. It shows a male student hoping to appear more virile by using a potion, resulting in a Jekyll and Hyde-style change of character and the physical and verbal abuse of his girlfriend.

It was written and directed by David Greenwalt, and first broadcast on November 3, 1998. Old enemies have returned to kill the slayers and when Cordelia is mistaken for Faith, she has to help Buffy fight for their lives.  Plot  Scott breaks up with Buffy the day after asking her to the Homecoming dance. Buffy continues to feed a weak Angel in secret, telling him the others would not understand that he is now better. At school, Buffy is monitored by two men in a van that are somehow connected to the vampire known as Mr. Trick. They overhear Buffy mention that a limo will pick up both her and Faith to take them to the Homecoming dance. The gang sends Cordelia to remind Buffy that yearbook photos are about to take place, but Cordelia is too busy campaigning for Homecoming Queen. After discovering that her favorite teacher does not remember her, and that it was Cordelia's fault that she missed yearbook photos, Buffy decides to compete for the Homecoming Queen title. Meanwhile, Mr. Trick introduces a competition, \\"SlayerFest '98\\", with a group of participants including German twin assassins Hans & Fredrick Gruenstahler, \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" hunter Frawley, Kulak, a demon of the Miquot Clan, and Lyle Gorch from \\"Bad Eggs\\" and his new wife Candy. When Xander and Willow try on their Homecoming outfits, tension builds until they finally kiss. On Homecoming night, Buffy is collected by a limo containing Cordelia instead of Faith. Cordelia gives Buffy a note from the rest of the gang who hope that Buffy and Cordelia will make up. Upon exiting the limo, the girls find themselves isolated in a remote location. They find a video tape message, addressed to Buffy and Faith, detailing the hunting of the slayers in SlayerFest '98. The participants attack and after Buffy defeats Frawley, the girls seek shelter in a cabin. Buffy and Cordelia find a phone and attempt to alert Giles to their situation, but the phone is soon cut dead. They begin to bond when Cordelia admits that she loves Xander and Buffy reveals that she spent a year's allowance on her dress. Kulak arrives and fights with Buffy until the German assassins fire a grenade into the cabin. Buffy and Cordelia escape back to the library, but Kulak is killed. Upon arriving at the library, Buffy and Cordelia find Giles has been knocked unconscious by Lyle and Candy. Buffy manages to stake Candy, but is knocked out in the process. Cordelia then scares off Lyle by persuading him that she is a bigger threat than Buffy. When Buffy and Giles regain consciousness, they discover the tracking devices in the corsages. Buffy distracts the German assassins as they enter the school, managing to plant the trackers on them and have them annihilate each other with their high-tech equipment. Mr. Trick is escorted to the Mayor's office, who recruits him to help control the rebellious youth of Sunnydale. Buffy and Cordelia finally arrive at the Homecoming dance to find that neither of them won the title. Reception \\"Homecoming\\" was criticized by Bryan Senn for concentrating too much on Buffy's self-pity, which prompts her to campaign to be Homecoming Queen. It leaves little time for the hunting-humans-as-sport storyline, a twist on the theme of Richard Connell's 1924 short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" and its 1932 film adaptation of the same name.

It was written by Jane Espenson, directed by Michael Lange, and first broadcast on November 10, 1998. Plot Principal Snyder hands out boxes of candy to all the students, which they must sell to pay for new marching band uniforms. Buffy sells half of her chocolate bars to her mom, and the other half to Giles. She then visits Angel, who is practicing T'ai chi. When she arrives home, Buffy finds her mother and Giles eating the band candy. The next day, Giles fails to show up for study hall, where Xander and Willow are playing footsie. Worried, Buffy goes to Giles' home and finds her mom on the couch. Joyce offhandedly gives her the car keys to drive home, to Buffy's astonishment. Giles, now acting like he did as a teen, invites Joyce out for some fun. Buffy and Willow find The Bronze packed with adults who are acting like teenagers, including Principal Snyder. They return to Giles' place to find out what is going on. At the warehouse, the vampire Mr. Trick checks up on Ethan Rayne and the production of the chocolate bars. Trick suddenly accuses one of the workers of eating the candy, and kills him as an example to the others. Buffy eventually puts two and two together and realizes that the candy is making everyone act like immature teenagers. She sends Willow and Oz to the library and drives to the warehouse. Upon arrival, Buffy finds her mother and Giles kissing in the middle of the street. Inside the warehouse, Buffy catches Ethan; her threat of violence persuades him to reveal that Trick needs to dull Sunnydale adults in order to collect a tribute for a demon named Lurconis. Meanwhile, four vampires enter the hospital to remove four newborn babies. Willow phones Buffy from the library and tells her that Lurconis eats babies. Giles remembers that the demon may be found in the sewers. Down in the sewers, the Mayor and Mr. Trick wait impatiently while the four vampires chant in a ceremony to summon Lurconis. Buffy, Giles and Joyce crash the party, and the Mayor quickly flees unnoticed. Buffy fights the vampires while Giles and Joyce take the babies to safety. The huge snake-like demon appears and swallows one of the vampires whole. Giles attacks Trick, but is thrown into the path of Lurconis. Buffy pulls down a gas pipe, igniting a fire that kills the demon. Back at his office, the Mayor asks why Trick fled, allowing Buffy to kill Lurconis. Trick replies that he thought he did the Mayor a favor by having the Slayer kill the demon, leaving one less demon to whom the Mayor would owe tribute. The Mayor warns Trick against doing him any more such favors. The next day, the adults have returned to their senses. Buffy and Giles meet Joyce, and Buffy exclaims that they are lucky she stopped them before they did more than they did. Joyce and Giles look very embarrassed, but Buffy fails to notice. Writing This is the first episode where script writer Jane Espenson is credited. Later on, she would love to put Giles and Joyce in front of embarrassing situations in the episodes she'd write, as a recollection of their sexual intercourse happening in \\"Band Candy\\".DVD Commentary, Season 5 Episode 15 \\"I Was Made to Love You\\".  Reception  Noel Murray of The A.V. Club writes that the episode \\"shows an alternate version of Sunnydale that's grounded in the town's own dark reality. Or as Oz says, 'Sobering mirror to look into, huh? List-maker and reviewer Jacob Hall wrote, \\"Season three's 'Band Candy' is probably one of the goofiest episodes of the entire series, but it's also one of the funniest, showcasing the writing staff's tremendous wit and the range of the show's supporting cast. The episode deals with a dark enchantment forcing the adults of Sunnydale to revert to their teenage mentalities, transforming the likes of Giles, Mrs. Summers and Principal Snyder into hilarious alternate versions of themselves. As awesome as it is to see Anthony Stewart Head pull off a 'bad boy' thing, the episode more than earns its place on its list for Armin Shimerman's sad, pathetic and totally endearing take on his normally cruel character.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3) episodes Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson ","title":"Band Candy"},{"id":"2298996","text":"Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Zeilin after Brigadier General Jacob Zeilin (1806‚Äì1880), the first general officer of the United States Marine Corps, and the seventh Commandant of the Marine Corps (1864‚Äì1876). * was a , commissioned in 1920 and decommissioned in 1930. * was a troop transport.

It was written by Doug Petrie, directed by James A. Contner, and first broadcast on November 17, 1998.  Plot  Gwendolyn Post arrives unannounced as Faith's new watcher. She is British, rude, confident, and looks down on all the Scoobies, especially Giles. She warns them that the demon Lagos is in Sunnydale looking for the Glove of Myhnegon, a powerful gauntlet. While doing research, Xander and Willow kiss for a second time. Xander goes looking for the Glove of Myneghon, but is distracted when he sees Angel, of whose resurrection the Scoobies had been unaware. Xander follows Angel, hoping to re-stake him, but observes Angel and Buffy kissing. Angel shows Buffy that he has recovered the glove. As Giles is meeting with Gwendolyn, Xander arrives to tell him about Angel. Gwendolyn does not overhear the conversation, but knows that they are keeping something from her. The next morning, the gang stages an intervention with Buffy. Both Xander and Cordelia are openly hostile about Angel and see him as a serious threat, unable to separate him from the recent misdeeds of Angelus. Willow is less sure and advises caution, partly motivated by guilt about her own private romantic indiscretions with Xander. Buffy tells them that Angel has the glove and that they are going to destroy it. Giles ultimately comes to Buffy's defense, but in private scolds her for not telling him about Angel's return. Gwendolyn goes to visit Faith at the motel and mentions that Giles is having a secret meeting with Buffy and her friends. The angry Faith ends up in a bar with Xander, who tells her that Angel is alive and has the glove, adding that Buffy knew about Angel's resurrection and possession of the glove but tried to keep it secret. The two nurse their grudges together; Faith decides to slay Angel and Xander eagerly volunteers to accompany her. Giles tells Gwendolyn where the glove is, and that \\"a friend of Buffy's\\" has it. He wants to discuss destroying it with her, but when he turns his back, Gwendolyn bludgeons him, knocking him out. Xander returns with Faith to get weapons, but he finds Giles unconscious and gravely injured; he calls an ambulance. Faith assumes that Angel attacked Giles, but Xander thinks it unlikely as there are no bite marks. Faith leaves to hunt down Angel. Xander tells Buffy about Faith's goal. Gwendolyn shows up at the mansion first and tries to kill Angel, not knowing that he is a vampire. Faith arrives as Angel is fighting with Gwendolyn. She assumes Angel is after the glove and attacks him. Buffy attempts to stop her, but Gwendolyn tells Faith to attack Buffy, and the two slayers fight. Having successfully distracted the slayers and enlisted the help of Xander and Willow, Gwendolyn puts on the glove and tests its power to manipulate lightning. The gang now realize who the real enemy is, and unite against her. Angel saves Willow from Gwendolyn's lightning bolt attack. Faith draws her fire which allows Buffy to throw a piece of glass to sever her gloved arm, leading to Gwendolyn's death by electrocution when the next bolt of lightning strikes. Buffy and her friends reconcile and they are willing to forgive Angel for everything. Giles finds out Gwendolyn was kicked out of the watcher's council and went rogue. Buffy goes to Faith's motel room but Faith has decided not to trust anyone after Post's betrayal. Reception Valerie Frankel described the episode's villain, Gwendolyn Post, as \\"arguably the most powerful woman of the show\\". She said that while Post appears to be the strong female mentor that Buffy and Faith otherwise lack, it is significant that \\"innocent Willow\\", who represents Buffy's sensitive side, is threatened by her. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club said the final battle was predictable, but praised the scene where Post puts on the glove and has her arm severed by Buffy.

Neighbouring villages are Blaenllechau, Maerdy and Tylorstown. Ferndale was industrialised in the mid-19th century. The first coal mine shaft was sunk in 1857 and was the first community to be intensively industrialised in the Rhondda Valley.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg749 History In Welsh, Ferndale is known as Glynrhedynog, the name of one of the old farms on which the town is built. In its infancy Glynrhedynog was also known as Trerhondda after the name of the first large chapel to be built in the town. The naming of settlements after chapels was widespread in Wales at the time, as is shown in village names such as Bethesda, Beulah and Horeb, but neither Glynrhedynog nor Trerhondda was destined to be used for long. Glynrhedynog is made from the words \\"glyn\\" meaning valley and \\"rhedynog\\" meaning ferny, and so coal from the Glynrhedynog pits was marketed as Ferndale coal, a much easier name for English buyers to assimilate. The Ferndale pits are what drew the workforce and their families to the area, and by the 1880s \\"Ferndale\\" was well established as a thriving town. With the phasing in of bilingual road signs from the late 1980s onwards, the name Glynrhedynog gradually reappeared and is now the officially designated Welsh language name for Ferndale. The Welsh language is on the increase in Ferndale after the village adopted the English language during the Industrial revolution. A Welsh language school is situated near the park and the school is named after the park's lake, 'Llyn-y-Forwyn.' (The Maiden's Lake) Industry The pioneer of coal mining at Ferndale was David Davis of Blaengwawr, Aberdare who already had an extensive colliery business in the neighbouring Aberdare Valley. His wealth enabled him to engage in costly but unsuccessful singings in the Rhondda Fach in the 1860s until he finally struck a good seam at Ferndale. Ferndale Colliery disasters Two large coal mining colliery disasters occurred in Ferndale during the 19th century. The first occurred on 8 November 1867, when an underground explosion killed 178 miners at the Ferndale Colliery owned by David Davis and Sons Ltd. The second disaster happened on 10 June 1869 when a further explosion resulted in the death of 53 miners.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg280 Governance The Ferndale electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Ferndale community and elects two county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has mainly been by the Labour Party but the ward had a Plaid Cymru from 1999-2004 and an Independent councillor from 2012-17.Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012, The Election Centre. Retrieved 26 October 2018. At the May 2017 election Labour and Plaid Cymru won a councillor each.County Borough Council Elections 2017, Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Retrieved 26 October 2018. A 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Ferndale merged with neighbouring Maerdy. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections. Modern Ferndale Ferndale has developed over recent years. Some new features have been added such as a new astro-turf field, car park and an all weather cricket training enclosure. The Sky1 TV comedy series Stella is largely filmed on location in Ferndale. Transport Between 1849 and 1856, the Taff Vale Railway opened the Maerdy Branch from , including a station at Ferndale. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1964 but coal trains continued until August 1986 when the line closed completely. Coal from Mardy Colliery was then raised through Tower Colliery. The track was lifted in 1996. Since 2005, the southern section from Porth to Pontygwaith is now the A4223 Porth and Lower Rhondda Fach Relief Road (Porth Bypass).http://demos.constructingexcellence.org.uk/userimages/Image322.pdf The upper section including the section passing Ferndale has become a branch of the Taff Trail cycleway. Religion There are several chapels and churches in or near Ferndale: * St Dunstan's Church (Church in Wales) * Bethel Baptist Church * Rhondda Fach Methodist Church (also called Ferndale Methodist Church) * Capel Penuel (Calvinistic Methodist) * Trerhondda Welsh Independent Chapel Sport left Ferndale is home to rugby union club Ferndale RFC, whose first XV team play in the Welsh Rugby Union leagues. Adjacent to Llyn y Forwyn is an astro-turf football field that, during the Summer, annually becomes the ground of sports days for many of the local junior schools. Also within the confines of Darran Park can be found a tennis court and bowling green. In December 2006, the Ferndale Skate Park was opened with indoor ramps and other equipment available to BMX riders, rollerbladers and skateboarders. The skatepark began with the aim of improving the prospects of school leavers in the area, providing a 'safe haven' from the influences of drugs and alcohol and an attempt to bring sports and healthy living to the area in a novel approach. It has since received National Lottery continuation funding as well as a Rhondda Trust grant to secure the future for an additional 3-year period.

History Driffield started as a booksearcher, obtaining titles to order for private customers, and in 1984 began producing a self-published guide to All The Secondhand and Antiquarian Bookshops in Britain. Hugely successful for its wit and wide coverage of the field, the guide was nonetheless idiosyncratic and often sarcastic, with entries such as: \\"the b[oo]ks are slowly transforming themselves back into rags\\"; \\"judging by body temp, shop seems to have expired in 1930\\"; \\"I could smell a bargain, pity was I had a cold that day\\"; \\"owner has been unwell recently with bad back (possibly caused by turning on the customers once too often)\\". Driffield also launched a periodical called Driffs: The Antiquarian and Secondhand Fortnightly, although the magazine was rarely published as frequently as that and folded after 22 issues. The guide went through at least five editions, dated 1984, 1987, 1991, 1992, and 1995. In the third he seemed to refer to a spell of mental illness after the publication of the second, though Francis Wheen thought this an intentionally misleading reference. Identity and rape allegations Although photos existed of Driffield (he fancied he resembled Raymond Carver), for a long time, little was known about him or his current whereabouts, or even if he was still alive, until 2014, when he was the defendant in a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, accused of five counts of indecent assault, one count of indecency with a child and two counts of rape. It was alleged that he had used these events as the inspiration for a novel. Driffield was found not guilty of these allegations. He stood trial under the name Xavier Driffield, although previously some sources had cited his name (seemingly erroneously) as \\"B.C.M. Driffield\\" and others as \\"David Richard Ian Frederick Field\\". He claimed to have been brought up in Newbury, England. In 1991, Francis Wheen considered that he \\"seems to be in his forties\\". In popular culture Drif appears as a character in Iain Sinclair's novel White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings. He appeared in the 1992 documentary The Cardinal And The Corpse, made by Chris Petit for Channel 4 and also featuring Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair. Sources * * With a photograph by Michael Woods.

He was the brother of Charles Cornwallis, the 1st Marquess Cornwallis, British commander at the siege of Yorktown. Cornwallis took part in a number of decisive battles including the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758, when he was 14, and the Battle of the Saintes but is best known as a friend of Lord Nelson and as the commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet during the Napoleonic Wars. He is depicted in the Horatio Hornblower novel, Hornblower and the Hotspur. His affectionate contemporary nickname from \\"the ranks\\" was Billy Blue, and a sea shanty was written during his period of service, reflecting the admiration his men had for him.Famous Fighters of the Fleet: Billy Blue, A Ballad of the Fleet , by Edward Fraser 1905 Early life William Cornwallis was born 10 February 1744. His father was Charles, the fifth baron and first earl Cornwallis, and his mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Viscount Charles Townshend. William was the younger brother of General Charles Cornwallis. Seven Years' War The young William entered the navy in 1755 aboard the 80-gun bound for North America in the fleet of Admiral Edward Boscawen. Cornwallis was shortly after exchanged into and was present in her at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758. The siege was one of the pivotal battles of the war. Louisbourg was the only deep water harbour that the French controlled in North America, and its capture enabled the British to launch an attack on Quebec City. General James Wolfe's attack on Quebec and victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham saw the beginning of the end of French colonisation in North America. When Kingston returned to England in 1759, Cornwallis was taken aboard the 60-gun by Captain Robert Digby. During the planned French invasion of Britain in 1759 Dunkirk was with Admiral Edward Hawke's squadron and took part in the Battle of Quiberon Bay against the French fleet under Admiral Conflans. The victory was part of what became known as Annus Mirabilis of 1759 and in concert with the other victories of that year gave the Royal Navy almost complete dominance over the oceans for over a century. The succession of victories led Horace Walpole to remark \\"our bells are worn threadbare ringing for victories\\". Cornwallis remained in Dunkirk when she was assigned to the Mediterranean fleet then commanded by Admiral Charles Saunders. Dunkirk was detached on blockade duty, ensuring the French fleet remained in the city of Heraklion, Crete. Cornwallis moved to Saunders' flagship where he remained for little over a year. On 5 April 1761 Cornwallis passed his examination for lieutenant and was promoted into the newly commissioned third-rate . In July 1761 Cornwallis was with Thunderer and two other line-of-battle ships blockading Cadiz. Two French ships escaped the blockade and the British squadron set off in pursuit. Thunderer caught up with the 64-gun and captured her in a single-ship action that lasted about half an hour. The British lost seventeen killed and one hundred and thirteen wounded. In July 1762 Cornwallis received his first command in the 8-gun sloop-of-war . In 1763 he was given command of the more powerful and newly launched 14-gun . He continued in her into the peace with France after the Treaty of Paris had ended the war in 1763. During the peace in 1765 he was promoted post-captain and given command of the 44-gun . He commanded her until she was paid off and the ship was sold in 1766. In September of the same year he was given command of and was variously employed throughout the peace between the Seven Years' War and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. American Revolutionary War When the French lent their official support to the American cause in 1778 with the Treaty of Alliance and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the war between Britain and the United States became a global war. Captain Cornwallis was in command of the newly commissioned . Lion was sent, with Admiral John Byron, to the West Indies. =Battle of Grenada= Battle of Grenada 1881 Jean-Fran√ßois Hue When war was officially declared, the Comte d'Estaing, the French naval commander in North America swiftly captured the islands of Saint Vincent and Grenada. Byron on hearing the news that Saint Vincent had been captured assembled his forces but on his way to recapture the island he received intelligence that d'Estaing and his fleet were in the process of capturing Grenada. Byron consequently took his fleet to Grenada in the hopes of engaging them and preventing the capture of Grenada. The island however had only held out for two days and was already in French hands. The Battle of Grenada took place on 6 July 1779. d'Estaing saw the British fleet of 21 ships of the line approaching and weighed anchor. Byron gave chase and attempted to form line of battle as per the Sailing and Fighting Instructions set down by Admiral Blake in 1653. d'Estaing, realising that his force although superior in guns was not so in numbers, had ordered his captains not to engage directly but to bear away when British ships approached and to bear down on any individual ship that might through wind or poor seamanship become separated from the line. This tactic proved successful and d'Estaing's ships managed to escape the superior force causing considerable damage to three of the British ships. Cornwallis Lion was one of those ships and when he became separated from the British fleet she was forced to break away and make a run for Jamaica rather than risk capture. Lion suffered a reported 21 killed and 30 wounded. =Duty in the West Indies = During his time in the West Indies, Cornwallis came to own, then later free the \\"doctoress\\" Cubah Cornwallis. Cubah became Cornwallis' mistress and housekeeper in Port Royal, Jamaica. Later she treated Cornwallis' friend, Captain Horatio Nelson on his return from the disastrous mission to Nicaragua. She also treated Prince William Henry, later William IV, when he was stationed in the West Indies. Lion remained on the Jamaica station under the orders of Admiral Peter Parker and when she was repaired began a series of cruises in the West Indies. On 20 April 1780 Cornwallis was in command of a small squadron of two line-of-battle ships, Lion and and one large 44-gun frigate, . Off Saint-Domingue the small British squadron discovered a convoy under the protection of four ships-of- the-line and one frigate commanded by Monsieur de la Motte Picquet. The French chased and the British ran. The French outsailed the British ships and when in range opened fire. The chase continued throughout the night and into the morning of the 21st. The breeze died and the two squadrons began to repair their damage. When the wind blew once more the chase renewed and continued throughout the night of the 21st and into the 22nd. On the morning of the 22nd three sails appeared to leeward. The arrival of these new sails would determine the outcome of the battle. The newcomers proved to be the 64-gun , the 32-gun and the 28-gun . The French squadron bore away for Cap-Fran√ßais, leaving the two small British squadrons to repair and make for Jamaica. The British squadron under Cornwallis had lost 12 killed including Captain Glover of the Janus. Cornwallis returned to England in Lion in June 1781 and took part in the second relief of Gibraltar. He was appointed to command the 74-gun third-rate , and immediately returned to the West Indies under the orders of Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood. Canada was with Hood's fleet at the Battle of St. Kitts in 1782. Hood took his 21 ships of the line and lured the French fleet of 29 ships of the line under the Comte de Grasse from its anchorage at Basseterre on St. Kitts and then sailed into the roadstead and anchored. Hood then repulsed de Grasse's efforts to dislodge the British fleet. The Battle of Brimstone Hill sealed the fate of the island despite Hood's efforts and St. Kitts fell into French hands. With the island in enemy hands and the French fleet cruising off the harbour, Hood was forced to withdraw and made his way to Antigua. Canada in Commodore Edmund Affleck's division suffered 1 killed and 12 wounded. On 22 March Hood joined Admiral George Rodney's fleet in Barbados =Battle of the Saintes= The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783, shows Hood's , centre, attacking the French flagship , right Between 9 April 1782 and 12 April 1782, Canada made up part of the fleet of Admiral Rodney at the Battle of the Saintes. During the battle, Cornwallis and Canada were fourth in line on the starboard tack in the centre division between and . Canada sustained 35 casualties in total with 12 killed and the rest wounded. The outcome of the battle meant that the French and Spanish abandoned their planned invasion of Britain's most valuable Caribbean island, Jamaica. The battle, although a victory for the English caused a great deal of controversy in later years that included Cornwallis' direct criticism in writing of Rodney. The final couplet of the poem said to have been written in Cornwallis' own hand reads: > Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet, > Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet. It appears that the criticisms of Admiral Hood and Cornwallis went unheard and Rodney was created a baron and given a life pension of ¬£2,000 per year. Cornwallis was sent home under Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves with the convoy that included the captured French flagship . A violent storm hit the convoy and Ville de Paris sank along with several of the convoy and one of the escorts, . The convoy and her escorts finally arrived at Portsmouth and Canada was paid off in October 1782. =Home service and peace= In January 1783 Cornwallis was given command of and in March of the same year was moved to HM Yacht Charlotte. The American Revolutionary War between Britain and the allied forces of America and France ended with Britain's defeat in September 1783 and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Paris. With the peace came the downsizing of the navy. Cornwallis however remained employed in command of the royal yacht until 1787. In 1787 he was briefly given command of before hoisting his broad pennant as commodore in the 64-gun in October 1788 when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the East Indies Station. Third Anglo- Mysore War In November 1791 Cornwallis ordered that French shipping be intercepted and searched for contraband. The British and French were not at war but the French were openly aiding the Tipu Sultan in his war against the British. Cornwallis detached Captain Richard Strachan in to intercept the and two French merchant ships that were heading for the French held port of Mangalore. The subsequent Battle of Tellicherry saw Phoenix capture and search all of the vessels. The local French commander was outraged and sent word back to France, but the French authorities were too busy with internal upheaval to pay the incident much notice. French Revolutionary Wars Though the conflict with Tipu Sultan was over, the French Revolutionary Wars had only begun. Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 February 1793, Cornwallis remained in the area and aided in the capture of Pondicherry, captaining his new flagship, the frigate , and commanding a small flotilla of three East IndiamenJames, p. 172‚ÄîTriton, Princess Charlotte, and . He left command of Pondicherry to Captain King and returned to England, docking at Spithead in August 1793.Brenton, p. 210 He was succeeded in command of the East Indies Station by Commodore (later Admiral) Peter Rainier. In May 1794 he hoisted his flag aboard the 74-gun and was promoted vice-admiral of the blue squadron. In August he shifted his flag to the newer and larger 80-gun and then once more in December to the first rate . Throughout this period he was in command of various divisions within the Channel Fleet. The Channel Fleet was responsible for preventing invasion from France and for the blockade of French Channel ports. =First Battle of Groix= First Battle of Groix 16 June 1795 by William AndersonOn 16 June 1795 he was in command of a small squadron that sighted a much larger French fleet. The ensuing action became famously known as \\"The Retreat of Cornwallis.\\" Cornwallis was cruising near Brest with five ships of the line, Royal Sovereign, , , , , two frigates and one cutter, , , when a French fleet of twelve sail of the line and fourteen large frigates appeared, commanded by Admiral Villaret Joyeuse. The odds being very greatly against him, he was compelled to order a retreat. But two of his ships were slow and unweatherly and fell behind the rest. The van of the French fleet began to catch the two slower British ships. The rearmost ship, Mars, was caught and suffered severely in her rigging and was in danger of being surrounded by the French. Witnessing this, Cornwallis turned his squadron around to support her. The French admiral made the assumption that Cornwallis must have sighted assistance beyond his own field of vision and had turned to engage the enemy knowing that a superior force was nearby to come to their relief. The French admiral ordered his ships to disengage and Cornwallis and his small squadron retreated in order. The action is remarkable evidence of the moral superiority which the victory of the Glorious First of June, and the known efficiency of the British crews, had given to the Royal Navy. The reputation of Cornwallis was amplified and the praise given him was no doubt the greater because he was personally very popular with officers and men. =Court martial= In 1796 Cornwallis incurred a court-martial (in consequence of a misunderstanding and apparently some temper on both sides) on the charge of refusing to obey an order from the Admiralty. He was practically acquitted. The substance of the case was that he demurred on the ground of health at being called upon to go to the West Indies, in a small frigate, and without \\"comfort\\". =Command of the Channel Fleet= John Bull peeping into Brest, The caption above the French fleet reads: \\"Mercy on us what a Monster -- he'll swallow all my ships at a mouthful. I hope he don't see me.\\"Cornwallis was promoted Admiral of the Blue squadron on 14 February 1799, and held the Channel Command for a short interval when Admiral Jervis (Earl St. Vincent) fell ill in 1801. Cornwallis took command once more when Jervis stood down as commander and became first Lord of the Admiralty between 1801 and 1804. On 23 April 1804 he advanced to the rank of Admiral of the White.Harrison On 9 November 1805 he was promoted Admiral of the Red.Harrison During this time Cornwallis was in charge of protecting the coast of the United Kingdom as Napoleon was building a large invasion force. Following Admiral Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, Cornwallis was removed from his post and Earl St. Vincent took his place. Honours and politics In 1796, Cornwallis was promoted to Rear-Admiral of Great Britain, the title becoming Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom after the Act of Union came into force in 1801, and then in 1814 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom His greatest honours might be considered to be his various nicknames among the sailors, \\"Billy go tight\\" (given on account of his rubicund complexion), as well as \\"Billy Blue\\", \\"Coachee\\", and \\"Mr Whip\\". Sailors appear to have only given nicknames to those commanders whom they liked. The various nicknames of Cornwallis seem to show that he was regarded with more of affection than reverence. Cornwallis was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1815. Cornwallis served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eye during the periods, 1768‚Äì1774, 1782‚Äì1784, 1790‚Äì1800 and, 1801-1807\\\\. He also served as MP for Portsmouth from 1782 to 1790. Later life Cornwallis never married. In 1800 he leased and later purchased the Newlands estate in Milford on Sea in Hampshire. He was joined by his close friend and fellow naval officer Captain John Whitby and his wife Mary Anna Theresa Whitby. John Whitby died in 1806, but Mary and her infant daughter Theresa stayed on looking after Cornwallis into his old age. On Sir William Cornwallis' death in 1819, Mary Whitby and her daughter inherited his fortune. References * Schom, A. (1990). Trafalgar: Countdown to battle 1803-1805\\\\. New York: Atheneum.

He was blinded along with his rebellious father √Ålmos on the order of √Ålmos's brother, King Coloman of Hungary. B√©la grew up in monasteries during the reign of Coloman's son Stephen II. The childless king arranged B√©la's marriage with Helena of Rascia, who would become her husband's co-ruler throughout his reign. B√©la was crowned king at least two months after the death of Stephen II, implying that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen B√©la's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone B√©la but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of B√©la's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted B√©la's suzerainty around 1136. Early years until 1131 B√©la was the only son of Duke √Ålmosthe younger brother of King Coloman of Hungaryby his wife, Predslava of Kiev. Historians Gyula Krist√≥ and Ferenc Makk write that B√©la was born between 1108 and 1110. √Ålmos devised several plots to dethrone his brother. In retaliation, the king deprived √Ålmos of his ducatus or \\"duchy\\" between 1105 and 1108. √Ålmos did not give up his ambitions and King Coloman had him and the child B√©la blinded between 1112 and 1115 to secure a peaceful succession for his own son, Stephen. According to one of the two versions of these events recorded in the Illuminated Chronicle, the king even ordered that B√©la should be castrated but the soldier who was charged with this task refused to execute the order. The child B√©la and his father, √Ålmos are blinded on King Coloman's order (from the Illuminated Chronicle) After their blinding, √Ålmos lived in the monastery of D√∂m√∂s, which he had founded. Krist√≥ and Makk write that it is probable that B√©la lived with his father in the monastery. The Annales Posonienses relates that \\"the child was growing in the reign of King Coloman's son, Stephen\\", who ascended the throne in 1116. Having hatched a failed plot against the king, √Ålmos left the monastery and fled to Constantinople in about 1125. For unknown reasons, B√©la did not follow his father to the Byzantine Empire. The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that he was kept \\"concealed in Hungary from the fury\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 157.112), p. 135. of the king. B√©la settled in the P√©csv√°rad Abbey, whose abbot sheltered him in secret. √Ålmos died in exile on 1 September 1127. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, B√©la's partisans \\"revealed to the King, who believed him to have died after his blinding, that B√©la was alive\\". On hearing this, King Stephen II \\"rejoiced with great joy, for he knew beyond doubt that he would have no heir\\". The king even arranged B√©la's marriage with Helena of Rascia and granted Tolna to the couple around 1129. King Stephen II died in early 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as Tarih-i √úng√ºr√ºs or The History of the Hungariansnarrates that B√©la ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had nominated as his heir had died. B√©la II was crowned in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 28 April, substantiating the reliability of this report. However, no scholarly consensus on the exact circumstances of B√©la's ascension exists. According to Gyula Krist√≥, B√©la was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a civil war between his and Saul's partisans, but P√°l Engel does not mention any conflict related to B√©la's succession. Reign=Consolidation (1131‚Äì1132)= Helena at the assembly of Arad in 1131 B√©la's blindness prevented him from administering his kingdom without assistance. He put his trust in his wife and her brother Belo≈°. Both royal and private charters from B√©la's reign emphasize Queen Helena's pre-eminent role in the decision-making process, proving that the king regarded his wife as his co-ruler. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, at \\"an assembly of the realm near Arad\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 160.114), p. 136. in early to mid-1131, Queen Helena ordered the slaughter of all noblemen who were accused of having suggested the blinding of her husband to King Coloman. B√©la distributed the goods of the executed magnates between the newly established Arad Chapter and the early 11th-century √ìbuda Chapter. B√©la's was on good terms with the Holy Roman Empire, jeopardizing the interests of Boleslaw III of Poland who had been warring with the empire. The Polish monarch decided to support a pretender to the Hungarian crown named Boris. Boris was born to King Coloman's second wife Euphemia of Kiev after his mother was repudiated for adultery. After Boris arrived in Poland, a number of Hungarian noblemen joined him. Others sent messengers to Boris \\"to invite him that he should come and with their help claim the kingdom for himself\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 161.115), p. 136. according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Accompanied by Polish and Rus' reinforcements, Boris broke into Hungary in mid-1132. B√©la entered into an alliance with Leopold III, Margrave of Austria. Before launching a counter-attack against Boris, B√©la convoked a council on the river Saj√≥. The Illuminated Chronicle relates that the King asked \\"the eminent men of Hungary\\" who were present if they knew whether Boris \\"was a bastard or the son of King Coloman\\". The King's partisans attacked and murdered all those who proved to be \\"disloyal and divided in their minds\\" during the meeting. Boris, who thought that the majority of the Hungarian lords supported his claim, in vain sent one of his partisans to B√©la's camp to incite the King's retinue to mutiny. B√©la tried to persuade the Polish monarch to stop supporting the pretender. However, Boleslaw remained loyal to Boris. In the decisive battle, which was fought on the river Saj√≥ on 22 July 1132, the Hungarian and Austrian troops defeated Boris and his allies. =Expansion (1132‚Äì1139)= Boleslaw III of Poland could not assist Boris after the Battle of the Saj√≥. B√©la's alliesSobƒõslav I of Bohemia and Volodimirko of Peremyshlinvaded Poland each year between 1132 and 1135. Sobƒõslav regularlyin 1133, 1134, 1137, and 1139visited B√©la's court. The Czech monarch even persuaded Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor to force Boleslaw III to abandon Boris and recognize B√©la's rule in Hungary in August 1135. The seal of B√©la II Hungary adopted an expansionist policy after Boris's attempts to dethrone B√©la. The chronicler Thomas the Archdeacon relates that Gaudius, who became Archbishop of Split in 1136, \\"enjoyed great favor with the kings of Hungary\\" and \\"often visited their court\\".Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split (ch. 19.), p. 105. The report suggests that Split accepted B√©la II's suzerainty around 1136, but this interpretation of the sources is not universally accepted by historians. The exact circumstances surrounding the submission of Bosnia are unknown but the region seems to have accepted B√©la's suzerainty without resistance by 1137. Historian John V. A. Fine writes that the northeastern regions of the province formed part of Queen Helena's dowry. The Hungarian army penetrated into the valley of the Rama River, a tributary of the Neretva River, in about 1137. Although B√©la assumed the title King of Rama in token of the new conquest, the permanent occupation of the region is not proven. Hungarian troops participated in a campaign launched by Grand Prince Yaropolk II of Kiev against Vsevolod of Kiev in 1139. B√©la strengthened his alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. For this purpose, he gave financial support to Otto of Bamberg's missions among the Pomeranians and arranged the engagement of his daughter Sophia with Henry, son of the new German king Conrad III in June 1139. =Last years (1139‚Äì1141)= B√©la's denar According to the Hungarian chronicles, in the last few years of his life B√©la became a drunkard. His courtiers took advantage of his drunkenness to receive grants from him. When he was in an alcoholic stupor, he sometimes ordered the execution of innocent men. B√©la died on 13 February 1141, \\"on the Ides of February, a Thursday\\".The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 163.117), p. 137. He was buried in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Cathedral. Family B√©la married Helena of Rascia upon the initiation of his cousin, King Stephen II at the beginning of 1129. Helena was a daughter of Uro≈° I of Rascia and his wife Anna, whose origin is uncertain. Queen Helena gave birth to at least six children. The first of these, the future King G√©za II of Hungary, was born in 1130. Three brothersLadislaus, Stephen and √Ålmoswere born in the early 1130s. Sophia, the first daughter of the royal couple, was born around 1135; she died as a nun in Admont Abbey after her engagement with Henry Berengar of Germany was broken. B√©la II's youngest daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1140, married Mieszko III of Poland. The following family tree presents B√©la's ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article. *Whether G√©za's first or second wife was his children's mother is uncertain.

The process is often a result of a sudden fall in sea level or the rise of land. The disturbance enables a rise in the river's potential energy, increasing its riverbed erosion rate. The erosion occurs as a means for the river to adjust to its new base level. Signs River Rejuvenation can lead to a number of changes in landscape. These include the formation of waterfalls and rapids, Knick points, River Terraces and increased meanders. Rejuvenated terrains usually have complex landscapes because remnants of older landforms are locally preserved. Parts of floodplains may be preserved as terraces along the downcutting stream channels. Meandering streams often become entrenched, so a product of older river systems is found with steep, very pronounced \\"V\\" shaped valleys - often seen with younger systems. Also, it does not have the same pattern as an oxbow lake, although, it also could. Example One example of rejuvenation is the Nile, which was rejuvenated when the Mediterranean Sea dried up in the late Miocene. Its base level dropped from sea level to over 2 miles below sea level. It cut its bed down to several hundred feet below sea level at Aswan and 8000 feet below sea level at Cairo. After the Mediterranean re-flooded, those gorges gradually filled with silt.  Causes  Rejuvenation may result from causes which are dynamic, eustatic or isostatic in nature. All of these cause the river to erode its bed vertically (downcutting) faster as it gains gravitational potential energy. That causes effects such as incised meanders, steps where the river suddenly starts flowing faster, and fluvial terraces derived from old floodplains. =Dynamic rejuvenation= A region may be uplifted at any stage. This lowers the base level and streams begin active downward erosion again. Dynamic rejuvenation may be caused by the epeirogenic uplift of a land mass. Warping or faulting of a drainage basin will steepen the stream gradient followed by the downcutting. The effect of seaward tilting can be felt immediately only when the direction of that stream is parallel to the direction of tilting. =Eustatic rejuvenation= Eustatic rejuvenation results from worldwide decrease in sea level, and two types of such rejuvenation are recognized. Diastrophic eustatism is the change in sea level due to variation in capacity of ocean basins, whereas glacio-eustatism is the change in sea level due to withdrawal or return of water into the oceans, due to the accumulation or melting of successive ice sheets. Eustatic rejuvenation relocates the mouth of the stream. Regrading of a stream toward a new lower base level will proceed upvalley. The result may be an interrupted profile with the point of intersection of the old and new base levels. =Static rejuvenation= Three changes may bring static rejuvenation, to the stream. # decrease in load # increase in runoff because of increased rainfall # increase in stream volume through acquisition of new Rejuvenation due to decrease in load took place during posts glacial times along many valleys that formerly received large quantities of glacial outwash. With change to no glacier conditions stream load decreased and valley deepening ensued. Rejuvenation may result in a \\"knickpoint\\", as it appears on a river profile, which often appears as a rapids or a waterfall. An example is Seljalandsfoss in southern Iceland, where isostatic (dynamic) uplift has occurred as a result of both construction and deglaciation. Static rejuvenation may also occur, in rare instances, when a downstream knickpoint erodes its way upstream to a lake which establishes base level for its tributaries. When the knickpoint reaches the lake, the lake drains, and the base level of upstream waters lowers rapidly from that of the (now former) lake to that of the river downstream of the knickpoint. At some point in the future, a quite dramatic example will appear when Niagara Falls cuts its way back to Lake Erie.  Canyons and gorges  Canyons and gorges are in the initial phase of valley development and are considered some of the most interesting valley forms. These forms result from accelerated entrenchment caused by recent tectonic activity such as especially vertical uplift. The uplift creates high-standing plateaus and as a result, perpetuates the downward erosive power of existing rivers.  Knickpoint and river terraces  A knickpoint is an area in the landscape where there is an unexpected irregularity in the gradient of the river profile. An example of a visible knickpoint would be a waterfall. However, some knickpoints can be concealed In the landscape. It is important that while there are other contributing factors to such features in the landscape, rejuvenation is one of the major influences. As mentioned, when a river rejuvenates, it gains more energy and erodes vertically to meet its new base level. This change in profile is visible at the knickpoint where it is the area where the old base level connects to the new. A terrace is the product of an old floodplain that remains at a higher altitude precedent river rejuvenation. The newly formed terrace begins to cut back and form a valley. This valley widens through lateral erosion. The process continues gradually and if rejuvenation occurs repeatedly, new terraces form as well, resulting in a step like profile around a river.

As a teacher and evangelist she laid a foundation for traditionally solid support for missions among Southern Baptists, especially through its Woman's Missionary Union. Virginia plantation roots Moon was born to affluent parents who were staunch Baptists, Anna Maria Barclay and Edward Harris Moon. She grew up to be 4 ft 3in (according to one account) on the family's ancestral tobacco plantation called Viewmont, near Scottsville, Virginia. Lottie was fourth in a family of five girls and two boys. Lottie was only thirteen when her father died in a riverboat accident. The Moon family valued education, and at age fourteen Lottie went to school at the Baptist-affiliated Virginia Female Seminary (high school, later Hollins University) and Albemarle Female Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1861 Moon received one of the first Master of Arts degrees awarded to a woman by a southern institution. She learned Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. Later, she would become expert at Chinese. Spiritual awakening A spirited and outspoken girl, Lottie was indifferent to her Christian upbringing until her early teens. She underwent a spiritual awakening after a series of revival meetings on the college campus. John Broadus, one of the founders of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, led the revival meeting in 1858 where Moon experienced this awakening. Although educated females in the mid-19th century generally had few career opportunities, her older sister Orianna became a physician and served as a Confederate Army doctor during the American Civil War. Lottie helped her mother maintain the family estate during the war, and afterward began a teaching career. She taught at female academies, first in Danville, Kentucky. In Cartersville, Georgia, Moon and her friend, Anna Safford, opened Cartersville Female High School in 1871. Moon also joined the First Baptist Church and ministered to the impoverished families of Bartow County, Georgia. To the family's surprise, Lottie's younger sister Edmonia accepted a call to go to North China as the first single woman Baptist missionary in 1872. By this time the Southern Baptist Convention had relaxed its policy against sending single women into the mission field, and Lottie soon felt called to follow her sister to China. On July 7, 1873, the Foreign Mission Board officially appointed 32-year-old Lottie as a missionary to China. Missionary work in China=Early years in China (1873‚Äì1885)= Lottie joined her sister Edmonia at the North China Mission Station in the treaty port of Dengzhou, in Shandong, (see Penglai, Perfecture City Yantai) and began her ministry by teaching in a boys school. (Edmonia had to return home a short time later for health reasons.) While accompanying some of the seasoned missionary wives on \\"country visits\\" to outlying villages, Lottie discovered her passion: direct evangelism. Most mission work at that time was done by married men, but the wives of China missionaries Tarleton Perry Crawford and Landrum Holmes had discovered an important reality: Only women could reach Chinese women. Lottie soon became frustrated, convinced that her talent was being wasted and could be better put to use in evangelism and church planting. She had come to China to \\"go out among the millions\\" as an evangelist, only to find herself relegated to teaching a school of forty \\"unstudious\\" children. She felt chained down, and came to view herself as part of an oppressed class - single women missionaries. Her writings were an appeal on behalf of all those who were facing similar situations in their ministries. In an article titled \\"The Woman's Question Again,\\" published in 1883, Lottie wrote: Lottie waged a slow but relentless campaign to give women missionaries the freedom to minister and have an equal voice in mission proceedings. A prolific writer, she corresponded frequently with H. A. Tupper, head of the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, informing him of the realities of mission work and the desperate need for more workers‚Äîboth women and men. =Expanded work (1885‚Äì1894)= In 1885, at the age of 45, Moon gave up teaching and moved into the interior to evangelize full-time in the areas of P'ingtu and Hwangshien. Her converts numbered in the hundreds. Continuing a prolific writing campaign, Moon's letters and articles poignantly described the life of a missionary and pleaded the \\"desperate need\\" for more missionaries, which the poorly funded board could not provide. She encouraged Southern Baptist women to organize mission societies in the local churches to help support additional missionary candidates, and to consider coming themselves. Many of her letters appeared as articles in denominational publications. Then, in 1887, Moon wrote to the Foreign Mission Journal and proposed that the week before Christmas be established as a time of giving to foreign missions. Catching her vision, Southern Baptist women organized local Women's Missionary Societies and even Sunbeam Bands for children to promote missions and collect funds to support missions. Moon was instrumental in the founding of The Woman's Missionary Union, an auxiliary to the Southern Baptist Convention, in 1888. The first \\"Christmas offering for missions\\" in 1888 collected over $3,315, enough to send three new missionaries to China. In 1892, Moon took a much needed furlough in the US, and did so again in 1902. She was very concerned that her fellow missionaries were burning out from lack of rest and renewal and going to early graves. The mindset back home was \\"go to the mission field, die on the mission field.\\" Many never expected to see their friends and families again. Moon argued that regular furloughs every ten years would extend the lives and effectiveness of seasoned missionaries. =War, conflict and scarcity (1894‚Äì1912)= Throughout her missionary career, Moon faced plague, famine, revolution, and war. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894), the Boxer Rebellion (1900) and the Chinese Nationalist uprising (which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911) all profoundly affected mission work. Famine and disease took their toll, as well. When Moon returned from her second furlough in 1904, she was deeply struck by the suffering of the people who were literally starving to death all around her. She pleaded for more money and more resources, but the mission board was heavily in debt and could send nothing. Mission salaries were voluntarily cut. Unknown to her fellow missionaries, Moon shared her personal finances and food with anyone in need around her, severely affecting both her physical and mental health. In 1912, she only weighed 50 pounds. Alarmed, fellow missionaries arranged for her to be sent back home to the United States with a missionary companion. However, Moon died en route at the age of 72, on December 24, 1912, in the harbor of Kobe, Japan. Her body was cremated and the remains returned to her family in Crewe, Virginia, for burial.Juliette Mather, Light Three Candles (Richmond, Women's Missionary Union 1974) p. 81 Relationship with Crawford Howell Toy Moon's gravesite in Crewe, Virginia Rumors characterize Moon's relationship with Crawford Howell Toy, a former teacher who became a controversial figure among Southern Baptists in the late 19th century, as romantic. Moon first met Toy at the Albemarle Female Institute. Lottie‚Äîwho previously learned Latin, Greek, French, Italian and Spanish and would become the one of the first women to earn a master's degree in languages‚Äîstudied Hebrew and English grammar under Toy's tutelage. Toy wrote of Moon, \\"She writes the best English I have ever been privileged to read.\\" While some contend Toy proposed to Moon before the Civil War, her mention of a marriage proposal from Toy dates from 1881. In the interim, Toy supported the Confederacy and became a professor of Old Testament studies at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, while Moon aided her mother on their Virginia estate.Allen, 33-36. However, following controversies concerning Darwinism and Toy's criticism of some Baptists' Christological Old Testament interpretations, Toy submitted his resignation from Southern in 1879. Moon's 1881 correspondence with FMB secretary H. A. Tupper, mentions her plans for a spring wedding with Toy, who was by then teaching Old Testament and religion at Harvard University. However, the engagement was broken and their marriage never occurred, with vague mentions of religious reasons. Toy's controversial new beliefs regarding the Bible, as well as Moon's commitment to remain in China doing mission work for Southern Baptists seem involved. Toy ultimately broke his affiliation with Southern Baptists and became a Unitarian.Allen, 139. Veneration Moon is honored together with Henry Budd with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on December 22. Modern legacy A monument to Lottie Moon on West Cherokee Avenue in Cartersville, Georgia. Lottie Moon has come to personify the missionary spirit for Southern Baptists and many other Christians as well. The annual Lottie Moon Christmas Offering for International Missions has raised a total of $1.5 billion for missions since 1888, and finances half the international missions budget of the Southern Baptist Convention every year. In terms of feminist historiography, Regina Sullivan argues that the decision of the Southern Baptists to allow women to engage in foreign mission work fit in well with the Protestant expectation that women ought to be the most pious members of society, influencing men to lead moral lives. However Moon was impatient with the usual restraints, and deliberately moved her China mission out of reach of male authority. Furthermore, she went so far as to persuade Southern Baptist women to form their own missionary organizations. However, Moon's feminist leadership was not followed by women back home. The Women's Missionary Union made her appear a martyr to the Christian cause rather than a feminist voice within the Baptist Church. Sullivan emphasizes Moon was a pioneer for gender equality; as she wrote from China in 1893, \\"What women have a right to demand is perfect equality.\\"Regina D.

Plot synopsis At the cemetery, Buffy stalks her vampire prey, killing several new vampires with a little unwanted help from both Riley and Spike. Riley demonstrates quite a bit of enthusiasm and new strength while fighting, while Buffy simply orders Spike to stay out of her way. As Buffy and Riley leave, Spike swears to taste Buffy's blood, but as he walks off, he falls into an open grave. Buffy and Willow debate over a topic from class and discuss Buffy's busy schedule. Buffy arrives at The Magic Box to train and is pleasantly surprised to see that the backroom has been transformed into an amazing training room. Harmony seeks Spike and his help because she is frightened that Buffy is out to destroy her. The two conspire to kill the Slayer. Joyce is chatting while making breakfast for Dawn, and in the midst of a sentence suddenly asks, \\"Who are you?\\" before collapsing onto the floor. At the hospital, an intern, Ben, informs Buffy and Riley that Joyce will be fine, but that doctors aren't sure what caused her to collapse. Dawn is playing with a stethoscope and when she listens to Riley's heart, she finds that it is racing much faster than normal. After listening to Riley's heart, a doctor recommends that he stay in the hospital, as tachycardia puts him at high risk of a heart attack, but Riley disregards their concerns. Buffy tries to think of a way to help Riley and finally resolves to go to Riley's place and contact The Initiative via the bugs in his room. Still part of the government, Graham tries to force Riley to see a doctor, but Riley is stronger than Graham and the other agents and gets away. After speaking with Graham later that day, Buffy takes it upon herself to get Riley to a doctor before he dies. Buffy gives Spike information about the doctor that can help Riley hoping that the vampire could help find Riley and bring him there. Instead, Spike and Harmony kidnap the doctor in order to force him to remove Spike's chip. Searching for Riley in the ruins of the high school, Willow uses a \\"Fiat Lux\\" (\\"Let there be light\\") spell to create light rather than use a torch. Tara is concerned by this. Buffy finds Riley in the Initiative caves, punching into rock because he can't feel any pain. He tells her that he's afraid he won't be enough for her once he lets the doctors operate on him. After convincing Riley to get medical attention, Buffy brings him to the hospital and finds Dr. Overheiser gone. Just after Overheiser finishes sewing up Spike's skull, Buffy arrives with Riley and a fight ensues. As he tries to bite the Slayer, Spike finds that the doctor only pretended to remove the chip from his head. When Riley suffers a heart attack and collapses while fighting Harmony, Buffy and the doctor immediately turn their attention to him. With the humans distracted, an enraged Spike escapes with Harmony, ranting about his disgust with Buffy and his weariness with how she is seemingly the source of everything wrong with his life. The doctor is able to operate successfully on Riley. Later, Graham talks with Riley and tells him he no longer has a purpose in Sunnydale. Without the Initiative, he's nothing. Afterwards, Buffy goes to Spike's crypt with the intention of staking him; however, when she confronts him, he angrily tells her to kill him. Spike angrily berates Buffy as the source of his torment, and yells that he would rather die and be free of her: however, Buffy cannot bring herself to do it and the pair kiss. Suddenly Spike wakes up beside a still sleeping Harmony; he's merely suffered a nightmare, but Spike is mortified at the thought he has feelings for Buffy.  Cultural references  * When Buffy discovers the training room, she says, \\"You're like my fairy godmother and Santa Claus and Q all wrapped up into one... Q from Bond, not Star Trek.\\" * Spike says, \\"Oh Pacey, you blind idiot. Can't you see she doesn't love you?\\" This is a reference to the US television show Dawson's Creek, in which the character Pacey was in an on again/off again relationship with Joey. Spike has previously shown an interest in another soap opera, Passions, when held by the Scooby Gang in Giles' apartment, as well as when Giles painfully admitted to having watched Passions with Spike out of boredom. This also foreshadows his own frustrations with his coming love for Buffy. * Buffy refers to the U.S. government as Big Brother. *When Buffy references thinking that hard work would be like a montage where the girl wakes up from sleeping on a pile of books with her glasses on crooked, the writers may be referencing the Charmed episode \\"Ex Libris\\" which aired several months prior to \\"The Real Me,\\" and features a scene in which Phoebe wakes up from falling asleep on a pile of books with crooked glasses. (Charmed and Buffy shared crew and production facilities during this time period.) *In the Season 5 DVD commentary, series creator Joss Whedon is quoted as crediting his inspiration for Dr. Overheiser to Mark Gatiss' veterinarian character \\"Mr Chinnery\\" in The League of Gentlemen, in both appearance and temperament. Continuity=Arc significance= * Spike discovers his love for Buffy, much to his horror. Spike's feelings for Buffy will continue and develop until the end of the series. * This episode is the first to hint at Willow's preference for using magic when not strictly necessary and Tara's unease with Willow's power and attitude. This will continue to be developed until the end of the series. * Joyce has her second outward sign of a head problem (she was troubled by a headache in the previous episode, which she attributed merely to Buffy and Dawn fighting), which produces another instance of someone with distorted perception being able to tell that Dawn was not originally human. * This is the first time Riley verbally conveys to Buffy he feels he's not enough for her. Other times this is visible include his confrontation with Angel in The Yoko Factor, his reaction to Buffy's attraction to Dracula in Buffy vs. Dracula and his subsequent visits to a vampire brothel in Shadow and Into the Woods. * Dawn empties a box of cereal so that she can find the cereal box prize. Joyce says, \\"You want the cereal prize, but you don't want the cereal. You are growing up.\\" This signifies that Dawn is increasingly becoming more human.

He travelled extensively in his youth as a travelling poet. During the 1960s he worked as a literary editor, and wrote short stories that were published in Science Fantasy magazine. Byrne's other works include the novel Groupie (1969, co-written with Jenny Fabian), the BBC \\"Wednesday Play\\" Season of the Witch (1971), and the scripts for the films Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1972, co-written with original author Spike Milligan and Norman Cohen), and Rosie Is My Relative (1976). He was script editor of the TV series All Creatures Great and Small (1976, 1978, 1985, 1988-1990), writing 29 episodes, and also produced scripts for One by One (1987). Byrne was the creator of the TV drama series Heartbeat (which was loosely based on the Constable books by Nicholas Rhea), writing 23 episodes for 17 series between 1992 and 2005. He also created and wrote for Noah's Ark (1997-98).https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-byrne-writer- of-feelgood-tv-dramas-826279.html Space: 1999 Byrne was the most prolific scriptwriter for the first series of Space: 1999 (1973-75), and was initially assigned the role of creative consultant for the second season (1976-77). However, hoping to make a greater impact on the American market, the producers desired a consultant from the United States, and the job was subsequently given to Fred Freiberger. Byrne's scripts for series one of Space: 1999 were \\"Matter of Life and Death\\" (based on a draft by Art Wallace), \\"Another Time, Another Place\\", \\"Force of Life\\", \\"Voyager's Return\\" (based on an idea by Joe Gannon), \\"End of Eternity\\", \\"The Troubled Spirit\\", \\"Mission of the Darians\\", and \\"The Testament of Arkadia\\". For series two, he wrote \\"The Metamorph\\", \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\", and \\"The Dorcons\\". Doctor Who Byrne is also known for his contributions to the British science-fiction TV series Doctor Who. The first of his three scripted and screened stories was The Keeper of Traken (1981), which resurrected the Master and served as the first instalment in a trilogy of stories (continuing with Logopolis and Castrovalva) involving the character. For the same story, Byrne created the character of Nyssa, who would later become a companion to the Fifth Doctor. Byrne's second story, Arc of Infinity (1983), featured the Time Lord villain Omega, who had first appeared in The Three Doctors a decade earlier. His final screened story was Warriors of the Deep (1984), which saw the return of monsters the Silurians and the Sea Devils.https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/johnny-byrne/ In 1990, Byrne wrote a script for a film based on the Doctor Who TV series. Due to a legal dispute between the BBC and the production company, however, the film was not made. Personal life Byrne left Ireland for the United Kingdom in 1956.

It developed numerous games for a wide variety of 8-bit micros, particularly those less well catered for by other publishers such as the Commodore 16, BBC Micro and Atari 8-bit. They also had a budget label, Micro Value, that issued compilations, reissues and some original games.

She was named for George Hampton Yarborough, Jr. History Yarborough was laid down on 27 February 1919 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Union Iron Works plant; launched on 20 June 1919; sponsored by Miss Kate Burch, the fiancee of the late Lt. Yarborough; designated DD-314 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 31 December 1920, Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Rosendahl ‚Äîlater the Navy's pre-eminent authority on airships ‚Äî in command. Following commissioning, Yarborough was fitted out at Mare Island into late January 1921 and departed the yard on the 25th, bound for Port Richmond, California, where she fueled. After trials in San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, and San Pedro Bay, the new destroyer tied up at the Reserve Dock at San Diego, California, on 2 February. Outside a trip to San Pedro with liberty parties embarked, the ship remained pierside through mid-April. One event was noteworthy during the ship's largely port-bound routine in 1921. She embarked Marine detachments from the cruisers and , both units under the command of 1st Lt. J. K. Martensteen, USMC, and transported them to Santa Catalina Island on 18 April. Underway from San Diego at 0615 on the 18th, she stood into Isthmus Cove, Santa Catalina Island at 1145, anchoring at 1205. After landing the marines, she got underway and hove to briefly to embark a passenger - Capt. Franck T. Evans, the chief of staff to Commander, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet and the son of the famous admiral Robley D. (\\"Fighting Bob\\") Evans - before she resumed her passage. Unfortunately, Yarborough collided with a buoy at the entrance to San Pedro harbor - an embarrassing occurrence in view of the ship's high-ranking passenger. Fortunately, the ship sustained only minor damage to a propeller blade, and no disciplinary action was taken. Yarborough remained alongside the Santa Fe dock at San Diego until 30 June, when she headed for the Mare Island Navy Yard. After a drydocking, the destroyer ran trials off the southern California coast, during which she shipped heavy seas over the forecastle that caused some damage to her bridge on 11 July. Visiting San Francisco briefly, the destroyer returned to San Diego on the 13th, where she remained into mid-October. Yarborough subsequently ran gunnery exercises and drills in company with her sistership late in October, after receiving on board a large draft of men from . Yarborough apparently joined the operating segment of the \\"rotating reserves\\" at that point because the rest of her career was largely one of operational activity. She spent the majority of 1922 operating from San Diego, touching at ports in the Pacific Northwest like Port Angeles and Seattle, Washington, and familiar California ports like San Diego and San Pedro. Upon occasion, she operated with the battleship forces and conducted drills and exercises in antisubmarine screening, torpedo firings, and, of course, the staple, gunnery. The following year, however, Yarborough began her voyages beyond what had become the usual west coast routine. After maneuvers out of San Pedro with the Battle Fleet, Yarborough departed that port on 9 February 1923, bound for Magdalena Bay, Mexico. Arriving there on the 6th, in company with Destroyer Squadrons 11 and 12 and the destroyer tender , she was underway again two days later this time bound for Panama. In the succeeding days that February, Yarborough took part in the first of the large United States Fleet exercises - Fleet Problem I. Staged off the coast of Panama, Fleet Problem I pitted the Battle Fleet against an augmented Scouting Fleet. Yarborough screened the Battle Fleet's dreadnoughts, often serving as a picket in a special defensive screen arrangement ahead of the heavy units. The exercise continued into March; and, during a lull in the maneuvers, Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby, embarked in , reviewed the assembled forces on 14 March. After further exercises, Yarborough departed the Panama area on 31 March as part of the screen for the northward-bound battleships. She arrived at San Diego on 11 April. For the remainder of the year, her schedule remained routine, operations within the vicinity of San Diego, San Francisco, or San Pedro, with a period under repairs at Mare Island and dry-docked on a marine railway at San Diego. On 2 January 1924, Yarborough got underway for Panama to participate in the next series of fleet exercises - Fleet Problems II, III, and IV - conducted concurrently. Problem II simulated the first leg of a westward advance across the Pacific; Problem III tested the Caribbean defenses and the transit facilities of the Panama Canal; and Problem IV simulated the movement from a main base in the western Pacific to the Japanese home islands‚Äîrepresented in that case by islands, cities, and countries surrounding the Caribbean. Yarborough's role in the maneuvers was similar to those she had performed before. However, there was one exception because, during one phase of the exercises, she operated with ‚Äîthe Navy's first aircraft carrier. She screened Langley on 25 January and witnessed an air attack upon the ship by planes of the \\"black\\" fleet. The destroyer also performed those tasks for which she had been designed (torpedo attacks and screening maneuvers) both with and against battleships. Yarborough and her sister-ships participated in the intensive exercises through late February, after which the destroyer paid a brief call upon New Orleans, Louisiana, her only visit ever to that port, between 1 March and 11 March. After further exercises off Puerto Rico, Yarborough headed for home; transited the Panama Canal on 8 April; and arrived at San Diego on the 22d. For the remainder of the year, she operated in and around her home port. The Scouting Fleet once more \\"battled\\" the Battle Fleet in March 1925, in Fleet Problem V, off the coast of Baja California. After that series of exercises which trained the Fleet in protective screening, seizing and occupying an unfortified anchorage, fueling at sea, and conducting submarine attacks, the Fleet set its course westward. Yarborough departed San Francisco as part of this movement on 15 April 1925. Her log noted: \\"underway in company with the United States Fleet to engage in joint Army and Navy Problem No. 3 and proceed to the Hawaiian Islands.\\" Screening Battleship Division 5, as a unit of Destroyer Division 34, she proceeded via Mamala Bay, Oahu, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 April. When the Fleet later concentrated in Lahaina Roads, Maui, Yarborough served a brief tour as guardship, patrolling off the entrance to the Fleet anchorage. During subsequent maneuvers out of Lahaina, Yarborough and her mates performed as \\"Cruiser Division 1\\" for the sake of the exercise, acting in that guise from 19 May to 29 May, before returning to Pearl Harbor for upkeep. After visiting Hilo, Yarborough departed Pearl Harbor on 1 July 1925, bound for the South Pacific as part of the Fleet's Australian cruise. Yarborough subsequently visited Pago Pago, Samoa, from 10 July to 11 July; Melbourne, Australia, from 23 July to 30 July; Lyttelton, New Zealand, from 11 August to 21 August; and Wellington, New Zealand, from 22 August to 24 August. Returning via Pago Pago, Yarborough and her division mates were pressed into service on 7 September as part of the dragnet searching for the downed PN-9 No. 1 - a flying boat which attempted to make a flight from the west coast to Hawaii. Destroyer Division 34's ships steamed at eight-mile (13 km) intervals in a scouting line and searched over the next three days before word reached them that PN-9 No. 1 had been found, her crew having stripped the plane's lower wings and used the fabric to rig a sail that had taken them close to Oahu. Yarborough eventually returned via Pearl Harbor to San Diego on 19 September and remained in the vicinity of her home port for the remainder of 1925. Early the following year, 1926, she took part in Fleet Problem VI, off the west coast of Central America, operating with the Battle Fleet and its train convoy against the \\"enemy\\" forces as represented by the Scouting Fleet and Control Force. Yarborough later visited Port Aberdeen, Port Angeles, Washington, and the Puget Sound Navy Yard before she rounded out the year operating locally from San Diego. The year 1927 proved to be a busy one for Yarborough, one that she began, as usual, at San Diego. Departing that port on 17 February, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 5 March, Atlantic-bound. The loss of the German steamship , however, forced a change in plans. Yarborough re- transited the canal four days later, on 9 March, and headed for the Gal√°pagos Islands in company with the rest of Destroyer Division 34. Forming a scouting line, the flush-deckers combed the seas for survivors of the Albatross. During the search, Yarborough often operated in sight of her sisterships and but found nothing. Abandoning the search on the 13th, the ship retransmitted the canal and rejoined the Fleet. Participating in Fleet Problem VII later that month, Yarborough operated off Gona√Øves, Haiti, and visited Staten Island and New York late in May and early in June. While in the New York area, the destroyer participated in the presidential review, when President Calvin Coolidge inspected the Fleet from the decks of his presidential yacht, Mayflower, on 4 June. Yarborough subsequently headed for Panama, arriving at Colon on 9 June. She shifted to Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, soon thereafter, due to an outbreak of unrest there. She joined and in guarding American interests in that port before heading back to Colon, retransiting the Panama Canal, and undergoing a drydocking at Balboa. She returned to Puerto Cabezas on 9 July and found and Shirk in port. Yarborough remained at Puerto Cabezas into early August, drilling her landing force in light marching order early in the deployment to be ready for any emergency. The destroyer sailed for the Panama Canal on 5 August, transited the canal on the 7th, and arrived at San Diego on the 23rd. She exercised out of San Diego and off San Clemente Island for the rest of 1927. The following spring, Yarborough again operated in Hawaiian waters, taking part in Fleet Problem VIII which was staged between San Francisco and Honolulu. Returning to the west coast upon completion of that group of maneuvers, the destroyer continued her regular schedule of operations in tactics and gunnery out of Port Angeles, San Diego, and San Pedro. Yarborough participated in her final large-scale maneuvers in January 1929, operating between San Diego and the westward side of the Panama Canal Zone, in Fleet Problem IX. That problem - significant in that the new aircraft carrier participated in the Fleet's war games for the first time - pitted the Battle Fleet (less submarines and Lexington) against a combination of forces including the Scouting Force (augmented by Lexington), the Control Forces, Train Squadron 1, and 15th Naval District and local Army defense forces. The scenario studied the effects of an attack upon the Panama Canal and conducted the operations necessary to carry out such an eventuality. As before, Yarborough's role was with the Battle Fleet, screening the dreadnoughts of the battle line. After alternating periods in port and operating locally, Yarborough was moored at the Destroyer Base at San Diego that autumn and prepared for decommissioning. Simultaneously, she participated in the reactivation of ships that had been in reserve during the past few years. Two of those ships were and .

He was recruited by entrepreneur Cyrus West Field as Chief Electrician to work on the pioneering endeavour to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable for the Atlantic Telegraph Company between western Ireland to eastern Newfoundland. This pioneering project of the Victorian era began in 1854 and was completed in 1858; however the cable functioned for only three weeks. While Whitehouse sent the first telegraph communications in 16 August 1858 to the United States of America, he was ultimately held responsible for the undersea cable failure after he applied higher voltages in an effort to boost declining signals. Life Born in Liverpool to a merchant, he qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1840 and established a successful practice in Brighton.Hunt (2004)  First transatlantic cable  Transatlantic cable route, 1858 In the 1850s, Whitehouse conducted experiments that, he held, showed that feared problems with practical data rates on underwater cables would not prohibit a commercial service. Though his claims were disputed by William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin), he was an able propagandist for the proponents of a proposed transatlantic cable. Cyrus West Field recruited Whitehouse as chief electrician to the Atlantic Telegraph Company; Thomson subsequently became scientific advisor, convinced that Whitehouse's theories were wrong but believing him to have the practical skill to make the scheme work. When the cable finally opened for business, it was beset with the problems that Thomson had foreseen. Whitehouse's inadequate apparatus had to be replaced by Thomson's more sensitive mirror galvanometer but Whitehouse then ruined the cable by delivering massive shocks of 2,000 volts in an attempt to rectify the problems. Whitehouse continually maintained that the cable and his equipment were a success. Though he put up a desperate public defence of his conduct and was more than ready to apportion blame among all other parties, an 1861 enquiry concluded that he should bear the majority of the responsibility. It has been argued that the manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.de Cogan (1985) Whitehouse was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, founding member of the Society of Telegraphic Engineers, and a member of the Royal Institution, the Royal Meteorological Society, the Physical Society, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

Bible use The Latin Vulgate, and following this many English versions such as the KJV, 1611, uses the word to stand for the meal offering under the Law of Moses. Ecclesiastical use It is thus applied to certain parts of the Eucharistic service in liturgical Christianity. The rites of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and some Lutheran churches employ an oblation: gifts of bread and wine are offered to God.C. Souvay (1911). Offerings. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved April 12, 2011 Liturgically speaking, there are two oblations: the lesser oblation, sometimes known as the offertory, in which the bread and wine, as yet unconsecrated, are presented and offered to God, and the greater oblation, the oblation proper, in which the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to God, the Father. The word oblate is also an ecclesiastical term for persons who have devoted themselves or have been devoted as children by their parents to a monastic life. Oblate is more familiar in the Roman Catholic Church as the name of a Religious Congregation of secular or diocesan priests, the Oblate Fathers of St. Charles. They are placed under the absolute authority of the bishop of the diocese in which they are established and can be employed by him on any duties he may think fit. This congregation was founded in 1578 under the name of Oblates of the Blessed Virgin and St. Ambrose by St. Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. A similar congregation of secular priests, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, was founded at Marseilles in 1815. Annualia In Catholicism, annualia were a specific type of oblation made for a deceased person by their family, though sources disagree on the nature of the offering. The 1728 Cyclop√¶dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences defines the annualia as a solemn Mass celebrated yearly on the date of the deceased person's death. Other sources state that the annualia was a series of Masses performed each day for a year on behalf of the deceased, at the behest of their family, who would pay a stipend to the clergy member performing the rites. The annualia could be extended to a triennial (daily mass for three years) or shortened to a trental (daily mass for thirty days) depending on the needs of the family.

After instruction at the Marine Barracks, Parris Island, South Carolina, he reported to the Marine Barracks at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 4, 1917 for duty with the 16th Company, 5th Regiment of Marines. Taken to New York in Seattle (Armored Cruiser No. 11), Yarborough embarked in Henderson (Transport No. 1) on June 14, 1917 sailed for France that day; and reached St. Nazaire on the 27th of June. Yarborough, promoted to first lieutenant on August 11, 1917, served two tours of detached duty while assigned to the 5th Regiment, first at Cosne, France, between December 8, 1917 and January 4, 1918 and then at Gondrecourt, France, between February 22, and April 29, 1918. On June 23, 1918, the height of the Battle of Belleau Wood, Lt. Yarborough arrived on the front lines. The next day, intense enemy fire from skillfully placed machine guns pinned down Yarborough's unit‚Äîa platoon in a support position in the American lines. The young lieutenant dashed from one shell hole to another, in the open, steadying his men, until a burst of machine gun fire hit him. Severely wounded, he refused aid until other wounded men in his unit received medical attention. Finally moved to shelter, he succumbed to his severe gunshot wounds on June 26, 1918.

The term is typically used in metallurgy, describing the reduction of the content of carbon in metals (usually steel). Decarburization occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 ¬∞C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surfaces which are in contact with the decarburizing gas. Decarburization can be either advantageous or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both something that can be done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step). The decarburization mechanism can be described as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel. Chemical reactions The most common reactions are: :C + CO2 <=> 2CO also called the Boudouard reaction :C + H2O <=> CO + H2 :C + 2H2 <=> CH4 Other reactions are :C + 1/2O2 -> CO :C + O2 -> CO2 :C + FeO -> CO + Fe Electrical steel Electrical steel is one material that uses decarburization in its production. To prevent the atmospheric gases from reacting with the metal itself, electrical steel is annealed in an atmosphere of nitrogen, hydrogen, and water vapor, where oxidation of the iron is specifically prevented by the proportions of hydrogen and water vapor so that the only reacting substance is carbon being made into carbon monoxide. Stainless steel Stainless steel contains additives which are highly oxidizable, such as chromium and molybdenum. Such steels can only be decarburized by reacting with dry hydrogen, which has no water content, unlike wet hydrogen, which is produced in a way that includes some water and can otherwise be used for decarburization. As a secondary effect Incidental decarburization can be detrimental to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative carburization, which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into the surface of the material during annealing. The decarburized surface material can also be removed by grinding.

This service ended on in May 1926, as a result of the General Strike of 1926, and the station was closed. It was very briefly brought back into use for special evacuation trains during World War II, but remained closed throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In October 1982, trains were routed through Dunston, due to the closure of Scotswood Bridge,Body, G: Railways of the Eastern Region Volume 2, 1988, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough, , p.133 and the station was officially re-opened by British Rail on 1 October 1984. Initially, most services on the Tyne Valley Line services called at Dunston. Service frequency was later reduced, due to low passenger numbers, particularly following the opening of Metrocentre in August 1987. Facilities The station is unmanned, and only has basic amenities, including a single waiting shelter on the island platform, timetable poster boards and a customer help point at the station entrance.

It is the main highway along the Indian Ocean coast of the country. Its total distance of makes it the longest numbered route in South Africa.  Route  Major towns and cities along the route of the N2 include Cape Town, Somerset West, Caledon, Swellendam, Mossel Bay, George, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Humansdorp, Port Elizabeth, Makhanda, King William's Town, Bhisho, East London, Mthatha, Kokstad, Port Shepstone, Durban, KwaDukuza and Empangeni. = Western Cape = City Bowl of Cape Town. The N2 begins in central Cape Town at the northern end of Buitengracht Street outside the entrance to the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. The first section of the N2 is shared with the beginning of the N1; it is a four-lane elevated freeway that runs along a strip of land between the city centre and the Port of Cape Town. On the eastern edge of the city centre the two roads split, and the N2 turns south as Nelson Mandela Boulevard, crossing above the yards and approach tracks of Cape Town railway station. The N2 descends to ground level in Woodstock before approaching the major interchange known as \\"Hospital Bend\\" because of its proximity to Groote Schuur Hospital. In this interchange, the N2 and the M3 merge to form a massive 10-lane freeway before diverging again. Because Hospital Bend is built on a steeply sloping curve, and lane-changing is often necessary to travel through the intersection, it was notorious for congestion and accidents, until it was upgraded between 2008 and 2010. After Hospital Bend the N2 turns east to travel across the Cape Flats as a 6-lane freeway to Somerset West; this section is known as Settler's Way. Along this route it crosses the M5, M7 and R300 freeways; it also travels just past the end of the main runway at Cape Town International Airport. It enters the Helderberg region where it passes through Somerset West and is reduced to an undivided highway, passing through several intersections with traffic lights, which cause frequent congestion. After Somerset West it bypasses Strand, Gordon's Bay and Sir Lowry's Pass Village. After Sir Lowry's Pass Village, the N2 climbs Sir Lowry's Pass to enter the Overberg region. It passes near the town of Grabouw on the Hottentots-Holland plateau before descending the Houwhoek Pass to Botrivier. After Botrivier it passes across the agricultural plains through the towns of Caledon, Riviersonderend, Swellendam and Riversdale to re-approach the coast at Mossel Bay, which marks the beginning of the Garden Route. N2 Freeway between George and Mossel Bay Just west of Mossel Bay the N2 again becomes a divided freeway, and remains one as far as the intersection with the N9/N12 just outside George. From there it travels across Kaaiman's Pass (see below) to Wilderness and on to Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. After Plettenberg Bay a section of the road is tolled as the Tsitsikamma Toll Route, primarily because of the Bloukrans Bridge; an alternative route used to run through Nature's Valley but this is no longer available due to flood damage.http://www.heraldlive.co.za/legal-need-provide-alternative-road/ The Bloukrans Bridge marks the border with the Eastern Cape and is the site of the world's highest bridge bungy, Bloukrans Bridge Bungy.My Destination Website, retrieved 26 April 2012 Bloukrans Bridge = Eastern Cape = In the Eastern Cape the N2 passes near Humansdorp and Jeffrey's Bay before becoming a four- lane divided freeway through the city of Port Elizabeth, ending at Colchester. The N2 continues in a north-easterly direction from Port Elizabeth, moving away from the coast towards Makhanda; en route the N10 splits from the N2, going northwards towards Middelburg and eventually Namibia. After Grahamstown the N2 passes through the former Ciskei; at King William's Town it turns back towards the coast, meeting it at East London. The N2 passes around East London on a bypass; it meets the N6 which runs northwards from East London towards Queenstown and Bloemfontein. After East London, the N2 turns again towards the interior in a northeasterly direction to avoid the difficult terrain of the Wild Coast. It passes through the former Transkei and its former capital Mthatha. Near Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal the N2 crosses into the province of KwaZulu-Natal. = KwaZulu-Natal = At Kokstad the N2 meets the R56 from Matatiele and makes a hard right towards the coast. The R56 separates from the N2 at Stafford's Post, running in a northeasterly direction past Umzimkhulu, Ixopo and Richmond towards Pietermaritzburg. The R56 can be used as an alternative to avoid the toll plaza at Port Shepstone, and one can follow the R56 to Pietermaritzburg, and then using the N3 from Pietermaritzburg to Hillcrest, where one can use the M13 as an alternative to Durban. The N2 eventually meets the coast at Port Shepstone, and is tolled once again. This is also the point where the R61 ends, providing an alternative route to Mthatha through the Wild Coast and eventually Cape Town via Beaufort West and the N1. From Port Shepstone it runs as a freeway past the resort towns of the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, including Umzumbe, Hibberdene, Ifafa Beach, Scottburgh, Umkomaas and Amanzimtoti, before passing on a 3 lane bypass around the city of Durban. At the Westville EB Cloete Interchange, the N2 meets the N3 which heads northwest toward Johannesburg. Major upgrades have been made to existing interchanges with the M19 Umgeni Road Interchange, the bridge over the Umgeni River and the M41 Mount Edgecombe/Umhlanga Rocks Interchange. Newly upgraded Umgeni Interchange Newly upgraded Mount Edgecombe Interchange After Durban, the N2 runs as a toll freeway passing through Umhlanga Rocks, Ballito and Tongaat. The N2 runs close to King Shaka International Airport and a tolled off-ramp provides access to the airport. It is tolled twice before the freeway section ends at KwaDukuza (formerly Stanger), once at Tongaat and again before KwaDukuza. It then continues as a single carriageway with two lanes on both sides and passes through sugar cane plantations on the KwaZulu- Natal North Coast. It is tolled once again, and for the final time at Mtunzini and meets the R34 which provides access to Richards Bay to the east and Empangeni and Ulundi to the west. The 34 km stretch of the N2 between Mtunzini and Empangeni is being upgraded to a dual carriageway. After Richards Bay, the N2 turns north, moving away from the coast into the heart of Zululand, where it bypasses Greater St Lucia Wetlands Park to the west and runs past the town of Mkuze before running close to the border of Eswatini, passing the town of Pongola. = Mpumalanga = After leaving Pongola, the N2 makes a direct line for Piet Retief and meets the R33 that links Piet Retief and Pietermaritzburg via Vryheid which is 370 kilometres away. It then heads for Ermelo where it eventually terminates where it meets the N11 at the corner of Voortrekkerlaan and De Emigratie Street in the town centre, just south of the N11's intersection with the N17. The total length of the road is 2255 kilometres.  Disruption to route  Heavy rains triggered a mud-slide on the Kaaiman's pass section of the N2 between George and Wilderness. This caused the road to be temporarily closed from 26 August 2006. As a result of the slide a section of roadway sagged and large cracks appeared on the road surface. After an inspection by a team of engineers a single lane was reopened on 29 August for vehicles with a gross mass of under 5000 kg. An alternative route following the Saasveld road was put into use, but this road only allows for a single lane of traffic and light vehicles. Heavy vehicles have to take an alternative route via the R62 and Langkloof pass effectively lengthening the distance from George to Wilderness from 11 km to over 600 km (news24.com story). The road has since reopened but major repairs are being done. Traffic on the N2 has also been disrupted on numerous occasions because of protests. On 10 September 2007, residents of Joe Slovo Informal Settlement blockaded the N2 Freeway in Cape Town near Langa. Police responded with rubber bullets injuring over 30 residents. On 4 December 2008, a few thousand residents of eMachambini, between KwaDukuza and Richards Bay in KZN, blockaded the N2 Freeway in protest against the proposed AmaZulu World Themepark. Police opened fire and injured about 23 residents and arrested about 10. On 20 October 2012, a section of the N2 was closed after heavy rainfall caused a collapse about 20 km outside Grahamstown.http://www.allzanews.com/2012/10/20/section-of-n2-collapses-in- eastern-cape/  See also  *National Roads in South Africa *The N2 Gateway Housing Project along the N2 freeway in Cape Town  References External links * Category:Highways in South Africa Category:National Roads in South Africa Category:Roads in Cape Town Category:Transport in Durban Category:Toll roads in South Africa ","title":"N2 (South Africa)"},{"id":"2299140","text":"Ponta Verde Beach, in Ponta Verde Neighborhood, in Macei√≥. Ponta Verde (Portuguese meaning \\"green tip\\") is a beach in Macei√≥, capital city of Alagoas, state of Brazil. A tip of land that rises out of the sea and is covered by green palm trees. This is the phenomenon that gave its name to one of the most frequented beaches in Macei√≥. In the past, it housed one of the most famous symbols of the city, ‚ÄúThe Rhea Neck‚Äù, a palm tree whose trunk resembled a rhea‚Äôs neck. It was located near the present Yacht Club Alagoas (Clube Alagoinha). The reefs form natural pools and it is very common, during low tides, to see tourists bathing in these pools, especially near the lighthouse. There are some stands with live music, bars, restaurants, snack bars, and hotels. Geography Ponta Verde is localised in the South Zone. =Climate= Ponta Verde has a typical tropical climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and pleasant trade winds blowing from the ocean. January is the warmest month, with mean maximum of 31 ¬∞C and minimum of 22 ¬∞C; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with means of 26 ¬∞C and 15 ¬∞C. The absolute maximum and minimum are respectively 33 ¬∞C and 11.3 ¬∞C. =Vegetation= Ponta Verde has a tropical forest. Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 2,000 mm (about 78 inches or 2 meters) and 1700 mm (about 67 inches). The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients. There are several common characteristics of tropical rainforest trees. Tropical rainforest species frequently possess one or more of the following attributes not commonly seen in trees of higher latitudes or trees in drier conditions on the same latitude. Demographics According to the 2006 census, the racial makeup of Ponta Verde district inhabitants was 98% White people and 2% Black people. People of Latin Europe descent form the largest ethnic groups in the district. Predominantly Roman Catholics religion and Portuguese language. Economy Ponta Verde is a vibrant tourist coastal area with hotels and pousadas (hostels), bars, nightclubs, pubs, restaurants, etc. Tourism is the most important segment in the district, because Ponta Verde district has beautifuls beaches with their calm and blue waters, their reefs and corals. Thanks to the barracas (traditional restaurants/bars built on the beach sand, just close by the sea waters and resembling huge Amazonian-Indian straw huts), thanks to the modern buildings facing the sea (luxurious hotels and residential buildings), thanks to the running and cycling tracks and row of benches that follow the coastline like at Copacabana beach in Rio or Miami beach in the US, thanks to the beach volley friendly practice and beach volley tournaments, and thanks to its beautiful squares and plygrounds, Ponta Verde is a place of entertainment, healthy activities, cultural activities, meeting, and nightlife.

History  During Niue's history as a territory of New Zealand, the national anthem of Niue was New Zealand's \\"God Defend New Zealand\\". \\"God Save the Queen\\" was also used and is still used as the royal anthem for the Monarchy of New Zealand. \\"Ko e Iki he Lagi\\" was created before the 1970s.

When it was written, it had become a popular song on Niue but the opportunity rarely arose for people to perform it publicly. In the 1963 South Pacific Games, Niue used the Flag of New Zealand as the flag to represent them in keeping with the rest of the colonies of the British Empire not using the Union Jack at the games. Niue also used \\"Ko e Iki he Lagi\\" as their anthem instead of \\"God Defend New Zealand\\" because the organisers had requested that \\"identifying tunes\\" be used to represent nations at the games instead of recognized national anthems. However, Niue failed to win any events so \\"Ko e Iki he Lagi\\" was not performed at the games.

Its population consisted entirely of Rajneeshees, followers of the spiritual teacher Rajneesh, later known as Osho. Its citizens and leaders were responsible for launching the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attacks, the single largest bioterrorist attack in the United States, as well as the planned 1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot, in which they conspired to assassinate Charles Turner, the then-United States Attorney for the District of Oregon. Settlement Rajneesh greeted by followers on one of his daily \\"drive-bys\\" in Rajneeshpuram. Circa 1982. Tensions with the public and threatened punitive action by Indian authorities originally motivated the founders and leaders of the Rajneeshee movement, Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh and Ma Anand Sheela, to leave India and begin a new religious settlement in the United States. Discussions of this new settlement began as early as 1980, but Rajneesh did not agree to relocate until May 1981, when he travelled to the United States on a tourist visa, ostensibly for medical purposes. Rajneeshpuram was planned from the beginning as a home for Rajneesh's followers in the United States, most of whom were told to sell all of their belongings before moving there. The decision to register as a town was made primarily so that Rajneesh could govern over his followers without attracting attention from authorities. Rajneeshpuram was on the site of a Central Oregon property known as the Big Muddy Ranch, near Antelope, Oregon, which was purchased by Sheela's husband, John Shelfer, in 1981 for $5.75 million, ($ in today's dollars). Within a year of arriving, the commune's leaders had become embroiled in a series of legal battles with their neighbors, primarily over land use. They had initially stated that they were planning to create a small agricultural community, their land being zoned for agricultural use, but it soon became apparent that they wanted to establish the kind of infrastructure and services normally associated with a town. Within three years, the neo- sannyasins (Rajneesh's followers, also termed Rajneeshees in contemporaneous press reports) developed a community, turning the ranch from an empty rural property into a city of up to 7,000 people, complete with typical urban infrastructure such as a fire department, police, restaurants, malls, townhouses, a airstrip, a public transport system using buses, a sewage reclamation plant, a reservoir, and a post office with the ZIP code 97741.La rivoluzione interiore, Osho, Edizioni Mediterranee, 1983, page 219 It is thought that the actual population during this time was potentially much higher than they claimed, and the neo-sannyasins may have gone as far as to hide beds and citizens during investigations. Various legal conflicts, primarily over land use, escalated to bitter hostility between the commune and local residents, and the commune was subject to sustained and coordinated pressures from various coalitions of Oregon residents over the length of its existence., reprinted in Increasing tensions The Krishnamurti Lake The city of Antelope, Oregon, became a focal point of the conflict. It was the nearest town to the ranch, and had a population of under 60. Initially, Rajneesh's followers had purchased only a small number of lots in Antelope. After the activist group 1000 Friends of Oregon became involved, Antelope denied the sannyasins a business permit for their mail-order operation, and more sannyasins moved into the town. In April 1982, Antelope held a vote to disincorporate itself, to prevent itself being taken over. By this time, there were enough Rajneeshee residents to defeat the measure. In May 1982, the residents of the Rancho Rajneesh commune voted to incorporate the separate city of Rajneeshpuram on the ranch., reprinted Apart from the control of Antelope and the land-use question, there were other disputes. The commune leadership took an aggressive stance on many issues and initiated litigation against various groups and individuals. Guest houses built by Rajneesh followers. The June 1983 bombing of Hotel Rajneesh, a Rajneeshee-owned hotel in Portland, by the Islamist militant group Jamaat ul-Fuqra further heightened tensions. The display of semi-automatic weapons acquired by the Rajneeshpuram Peace Force created an image of imminent violence. Rumors arose of the National Guard being called in to arrest Rajneesh. At the same time, the commune was embroiled in a range of legal disputes. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer maintained that the city was essentially an arm of a religious organization, and that its incorporation thus violated the principle of separation of church and state. 1000 Friends of Oregon claimed that the city violated state land-use laws. In 1983, a lawsuit was filed by the State of Oregon to invalidate the city's incorporation, and many attempts to expand the city further were legally blocked, prompting followers to attempt to build in nearby Antelope, which was briefly named Rajneesh, when sufficient numbers of Rajneeshees registered to vote there and won a referendum on the subject. The Rajneeshpuram residents believed that the wider Oregonian community was both bigoted and suffered from religious intolerance. According to Latkin (1992) Rajneesh's followers had made peaceful overtures to the local community when they first arrived in Oregon. As Rajneeshpuram grew in size heightened tension led certain fundamentalist Christian church leaders to denounce Rajneesh, the commune, and his followers. Petitions were circulated aimed at ridding the state of the perceived menace. Letters to state newspapers reviled the Rajneeshees, one of them likening Rajneeshpuram to another Sodom and Gomorrah, another referring to them as a \\"cancer in our midst.\\" In time, circulars mixing \\"hunting humor\\" with dehumanizing characterizations of Rajneeshees began to appear at gun clubs, turkey shoots and other gatherings; one of these, circulated widely over the Northwest, declared \\"an open season on the central eastern Rajneesh, known locally as the Red Rats or Red Vermin.\\" As Rajneesh himself did not speak in public during this period, and until October 1984 gave few interviews, his secretary and chief spokesperson Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) became, for practical purposes, the leader of the commune. She did little to defuse the conflict, employing a crude, caustic and defensive speaking style that exacerbated hostilities and attracted media attention. On September 14, 1985, Sheela and 15 to 20 other top officials abruptly left Rajneeshpuram. The following week, Rajneesh convened press conferences and publicly accused Sheela and her team of having committed crimes within and outside the commune. The subsequent criminal investigation, the largest in Oregon history, confirmed that a secretive group had, unbeknownst to both government officials and nearly all Rajneeshpuram residents, engaged in a variety of criminal activities, including the attempted murder of Rajneesh's physician, wiretapping and bugging within the commune and within Rajneesh's home, poisonings of two public officials, and arson.  Role in 1984 bioterror attack  In 1984, Sheela Silverman coordinated an attack alongside Rajneeshpuram citizens to infect the salad bars of at least ten restaurants in the county seat of Wasco County with salmonella, in an attempt to incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 Wasco County elections. While 751 people, including several Wasco County public officials, were infected, and 45 people were hospitalized, there were no fatalities. This incident is still regarded as the single largest biological warfare attack in United States history. Local residents, suspecting Rajneeshpuram to be involved in the poisonings, turned out in droves on election day to prevent them from winning any county positions. The Rajneeshees eventually withdrew their candidate from the November 1984 ballot, rendering their plot unsuccessful. Outcome Air Rajneesh Convair 240 and Douglas DC-3 at Big Muddy Ranch Airport in October 1985. Convair 240 of Air Rajneesh, used to transport passengers and cargo to the enclave Sheela was extradited from West Germany and imprisoned for attempted murder, assault, wiretapping, arson, immigration fraud, and her role in the bioterror attack. During the next few years the movement also came under investigation for multiple other felonies: * Arson: On January 14, 1985 the Wasco County Planning Department office, which held the files on long- running disputes involving the Rajneeshees, was set on fire. The fire extensively damaged the office and destroyed one-third to one-half of the county's files. * Attempted Murder (Main article: 1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot): Several commune members plotted to kill Charles H. Turner, the U.S. state attorney in Portland, and several other persons considered to be Rajneeshee enemies. Others were on the ‚Äúhit list‚Äù including Dave Frohnmayer, the Oregon Attorney General who first started to publicly dispute the Rajneesh activities. * Immigration Fraud: Despite originally travelling to the United States claiming medical reasons, Rajneesh never sought medical treatment during his residence, and later admitted to counts of immigration fraud. * Voting Fraud: The Rajneeshpuram community attempted to sway local elections in their favor in a variety of methods, including the \\"Share-a-Home\\" program, in which they transported thousands of homeless people to Rajneeshpuram and attempted to register them to vote to inflate the constituency of voters for the group's candidates. The Wasco county clerk countered this attempt by enforcing a regulation that required all new voters to submit their qualifications when registering to vote. * Drug Smuggling These criminal activities had, according to the Office of the Attorney General, begun in the spring of 1984, three years after the establishment of the commune. Rajneesh himself was accused of immigration violations, to which he entered an Alford plea. As part of his plea bargain, he agreed to leave the United States and eventually returned to Poona, India. His followers left Oregon shortly afterwards. The increasing ability and capacity of local and state regulators to actively limit the development of Rajneeshpuram this way was one major factor that led to the sudden collapse of the commune in September and October 1985. The legal standing of Rajneeshpuram remained ambiguous. In the church/state suit, Federal Judge Helen J. Frye ruled against Rajneeshpuram in late 1985, a decision that was not contested, since it came too late to be of practical significance. The Oregon courts, however, eventually found in favor of the city, with the Court of Appeals determining in 1986 that incorporation had not violated the state planning system's agricultural land goals. The Oregon Supreme Court ended litigation in 1987, leaving Rajneeshpuram empty and bankrupt, but legal within Oregon law.1000 Friends of Oregon v. Wasco County Court, 703 P.2d 207 (Or 1985), 723 P.2d 1039 (Or App. 1986), 752 P.2d 39 (Or 1987) Originally listed for over $28 million in 1985, the ranch was sold at a sheriff's auction for $4.5 million in late 1988 to Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, the sole bidder. Washington Family Ranch Dennis R. Washington's firm Washington Construction purchased The Big Muddy Ranch for $3.6 million in 1991. Washington attempted to run the ranch for profit, and also unsuccessfully negotiated with the state to turn it into a state park. In 1996, Washington donated the ranch to Young Life, a Christian youth organization. Since 1999, Young Life has operated a summer camp there, first as the WildHorse Canyon Camp, later as the Washington Family Ranch. There are two camps on the property today. The primary camp, Washington Family Ranch: Canyon serves high school students, while the smaller camp, Washington Family Ranch: Creekside, primarily serves middle school students. The Big Muddy Ranch Airport is also located there.

This constitution was far less liberal than the federal constitution of the German Empire. The government was not responsible to the Abgeordnetenhaus (lower chamber), whose powers were small and whose members were elected by a Prussian three-class suffrage system based on tax-paying abHerrenhaus (upper chamber) was largely controlled by the conservative Junkers, who held immense tracts of generally poor land east of the Elbe (particularly in East Prussia). Endowed with little money and much pride, they had continued to form the officer corps of the Prussian Army. The rising industrialists, notably the great Rhenish and Westphalian mine owners and steel magnates, although their interests were often opposed to those of the Junkers, exerted an equally reactionary influence on politics. The \\"potential power of the Prusso-German crown was vast\\" (Christopher Clarke, Kaiser Wilhelm II); for example, the monarch held the power to nominate and dismiss Prussian officials (as well as federal ones). His assent was also necessary for legislation to pass into law, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and coming with this, the power to appoint or dismiss officials during peacetime. In a decree William I of Prussia, stated that acts of the Prussian government were those of the King of Prussia, \\"from whose decision they originate, and who expresses his opinion and will constitutionally through them\\".Christopher Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II Transformation Prussia was transformed from a duchy to a kingdom on 18 January 1701 by Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg who declared himself King in Prussia. He was allowed to be king only in the Prussian kingdom to avoid offending the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, who had power over most of his lands. Brandenburg was treated as a separate state from the Prussian Kingdom. The state of Brandenburg was later considered as part of Prussia although most of its territories lay outside Prussia proper. The kingdom grew magnificently during King Frederick I reign. The Kingdom King Frederick II of Prussia succeeded Frederick I's son Frederick William. He considered himself as the first true servant of Prussia. He promoted the development of Prussia such as the Oderbruch. He also developed the military structure of the state and got involved in the First Partition of Poland with Austria and Russia. Frederick the Great became known as the first ‚ÄúKing of Prussia.‚Äù During his reign, he practiced enlightened absolutism. He was a fair king who introduced the civil code and abolished torture. He applied the principle that the monarchy should not go interfere with the justice system. Crisis In 1847, Prussia experienced crisis common to all German states. There were catastrophic crop failures, bread riots, serious business recession and government incapability. In 1848, drastic changes in the Prussian kingdom began. Many bloody revolutions forced Frederick William IV to make transformations in the government. New ministers occupied a middle position in an unstable government structure. The King was gradually recovering power over his states with the aid of a set of advisers called the Kamarilla. An elected national assembly was challenging the reemergence of the King's power. There began a tug-of-war in the power over the governance of the Kingdom between the king and the national assembly. After a series of cabinet reshuffles and government transformations, a new constitution was approved. It excluded a systematic democratic influence which shows that revolutionary movements had not much power. However, the king had lost his absolute powers. A new constitution was adopted which made the kingdom of Prussia a constitutional state. It was one of the most significant achievements of the revolutions. Prussia's Constitution * In 1850, a new constitution was adopted by the Kingdom of Prussia. This was improved in the consequent years. The newly adopted constitution was less liberal compared with the federal constitution of the rest of the German empire. The Prussian constitution also included the Landtag or \\"State Diet\\". They had less power than the rest of the constitutional members. They were elected by a suffrage system based on the amount of tax paid. The constitution also included a Herrenhaus, (\\"House of Lords\\") which was mostly controlled by the conservative Junkers. They held large areas of poor land in the east of Elbe in the east of Prussia. They formed the officer corps of the army of Prussia. The Rhenish and Westphalian rising industrialists also had equal political power with the Junkers. * In 1918, the Prussian constitution became liberalised after it was transformed into a republic. The Junkers lost most of their lands and the influence of Rhenish industrialist extended throughout the land. In 1932, Franz von Papen was appointed German chancellor and also became commissioner for Prussia. In 1932, he suspended the Landtag and ousted Otto Braun who was then the Social Democratic Premier of Prussia. Luckentheorie is a gap in the Prussian constitution after the 1848 revolutions. Otto von Bismarck exploited this to solve the crisis over taxes for military reforms. Free State of Prussia The Prussian constitution was liberalized after Prussia became a republic in 1918, and the Junkers lost many of their estates through the cession of Prussian territory to Poland. However, both the Junkers and the Rhenish industrialists continued to exert much power behind the scenes, and when Franz von Papen became German chancellor in 1932 and commissioner for Prussia, they came into their own. In July, 1932, Papen suspended the Prussian parliament and ousted the Social Democrat Otto Braun, who had been premier of Prussia (with brief interruptions) from 1920.

The band was ministry oriented, and had what Christian music critic John J. Thompson characterized as a significant impact on their scene. Background Their second demo (1987) was reworked for release by R.E.X. Records under the name Celestial Messenger. It featured a metal sound typical of the hair era of metal. Their debut's lyrics also reflect their ministry orientation, one stated that the band wrote about \\"getting closer to God and not rejecting the Truth.\\" The album became a classic for fans of Christian metal and was subject to an illegal re-release in 1998. The legal 2000 re-release of Celestial Messenger features a bonus of three remastered tracks as well as material from an early demo a bonus. Their second album, Sylentiger, was released in 1990. It featured a harder sound and lyrics which the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music characterised as presenting a need for salvation with a viewpoint from arminian theology. In retrospect HM magazine editor Doug Van Pelt found the record to be disappointing compared to their debut. Trytan disbanded in the early 1990s. Lary Dean started a ministry in 1991 which had evolved into the Heart Maneuvers Christian Fellowship church by 1993. Scott Blackman, drummer on Celestial Messenger, eventually became an associate pastor there. Lary Dean continued to work in the Chicago music scene.

Consoles also usually display a log of warnings, errors, and other messages produced during the program's execution. Typically it can be toggled on or off and appears over the normal game view. The console is normally accessed by pressing the backtick key \` (frequently also called the ~ key; normally located below the ESC key) on QWERTY keyboards or the ¬≤ on AZERTY keyboards, and is usually hidden by default. In most cases it cannot be accessed unless enabled by either specifying a command line argument when launching the game or by changing one of the game's configuration files. History A classic console is a box that scrolls down from the top of the screen. This style was made popular with Quake (1996). There are other forms of console: * Quake III Arena has one or two consoles, depending on the platform the game was released for. The first is the internal console, which exists on all platforms. The second is an external console, created via the Windows API. The console printing function directs to both, likewise, both consoles can also have text input to them. The external console is used for dedicated servers and to log startup of the engine. Finally, the external console is also used to show errors and display debugging output should the game crash. * Dark Engine's console shows output up to 4 lines in length and is accessed by pressing 3 particular keys at the same time. * Lithtech's console has no output and is used mainly for entering cheat codes. * ARK: Survival Evolved is an open world action and adventure survival video game is by Studio Wildcard. A lot of ARK commands will require the ‚ÄòEnable Cheats‚Äò command to be used before going further, as well as the Enable Cheats for Player command. It is an absolute must to use this before using to any other command. * A single-line variant can be seen in games from The Sims series, to which can be invoked using Ctrl+Shift+C. While mainly used for cheats, it can also be used for purposes similar to most developer console implementations. * On the Microsoft Windows version of Grand Theft Auto V, the console appears as a floating text box in the middle of the screen, and is generally used to enter cheat codes or spawn items. * The Source engine's console is a window all by itself. Example commands *sv_cheats 1: Used to activate cheats in Quake engine or Source engine based games.https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Console_Command_List *god: Used to toggle God mode. **buddha: Similar to god mode in Source games, where the player can take damage down to a health of 1 but not die. *noclip or ghost: Used to toggle Noclip mode. *fly: Similar to Noclip mode, the player is only constrained to the walls and boundaries of the map. *impulse 101: Gives the player full health, full ammo, and all weapons in Source Engine based games.

They were connected to Japan's counterculture movement and noted for their mixture of early heavy metal with psychedelic and progressive rock. They received wide acclaim from critics but failed to achieve commercial success and separated in 1973 to pursue individual careers. The band reunited in late 2007, but permanently disbanded after the 2011 death of vocalist Joe Yamanaka. While the band's releases have never sold well they continue to be held in high regard by the music industry. Their albums have never been out of print and they continue to be made available on new audiophile formats such as SHM-CDs. Former members of the Flower Travellin' Band continue to perform FTB songs live together under the name Flower Power with other musicians. History The band was initially started as a side-project by Yuya Uchida when he returned to Japan after visiting his friend John Lennon in England in the mid 1960s, where he was introduced to various upcoming artists such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix. Yuya wanted to introduce a similar sound to the Japanese, and formed the \\"Flowers\\" as a cover band with various group sounds musicians, and two vocalists; male singer Hiroshi Chiba and female singer Remi Aso. They released the album Challenge! in 1968, featuring covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company, in addition to an original song. The cover caused a stir in the Japanese media as it depicted each member posing naked. In 1969, after the release of the album; Remi Aso and guitarist Katsuhiko Kobayashi relocated to the United States. Yuya dropped all the remaining members, except drummer George Wada, recruited guitarist Hideki Ishima and vocalist Joe Yamanaka from the blues group Mystic Morning and bassist Jun Kobayashi, and formed the Flower Travellin' Band as a band that would appeal to international audiences. Their first releases were backing jazz trumpeter Terumasa Hino on the single \\"Crash\\" followed by the mini-album Anywhere in 1970, made to emulate the Flowers' release by means of cover songs and a nude photo on the album's front. At Expo '70, members of Canadian rock band Lighthouse saw Flower Travellin' Band perform, liked what they saw and suggested they go to Canada. The group quickly recorded their first album of original material, Satori released in 1971, to have something to bring with them. In December 1970, they relocated to Toronto where they performed with Dr. John and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In 1971 they performed four large concerts with Lighthouse at Ontario Place. While in Toronto they recorded their second original album Made in Japan and were approached by GRT Records. They returned to Japan in March 1972 for a show at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, and in 1973 were billed to perform with the Rolling Stones throughout their Japanese tour; however, all concerts were canceled when Mick Jagger's visa was rejected due to a drug conviction. They released a half-studio, half-live album titled Make Up and in April performed at Maruyama Park in Kyoto. Hideki Ishima abandoned guitar in 1990 and has played the sitarla, an instrument he invented, exclusively since 2000. It was their last concert before a long hiatus, as at this time Yuya became involved in numerous projects and each member went on to an individual career. Joe Yamanaka recorded numerous solo albums, and collaborated with the iconic reggae band The Wailers in the 1980s. Having quit the guitar in 1990, Hideki Ishima continued his studies of the sitar, which he began around 1968, under Indian classical musician Manilal Nag and his Japanese apprentice in 1998. In 2000, he invented the sitarla, which combines the qualities of a solid-body electric guitar and the sitar. On November 25, 2007, Flower Travellin' Band officially reunited and formally recruited keyboardist Nobuhiko Shinohara, with whom they had previously worked. Ishima revealed that there were several talks about getting back together prior, but they were all centered around nostalgia, something he has no interest in. It was only when their producer suggested they write new material and play it together with the old songs for a three- year period that a reunion came to fruition. Ishima also said that even though Kobayashi and Kozuki had not played in years, they were eager and pushed him into doing it, helped by the fact that his new instrument made the old material interesting. In 2008, 35 years after their last, they released the album We Are Here. They performed in New York City in November and in Canada the following month. In March 2010, future tours and productions were halted when it was announced that Yamanaka was diagnosed with lung cancer. Yamanaka died from his cancer on August 7, 2011 at the age of 64, putting an end to the band. Yuya Uchida died from pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital on March 17, 2019, aged 79.

Eventually he becomes the lover and most faithful servant of Alexander the Great, who overthrew Darius and captured the Persian Empire. Bagoas' narration provides both a Persian view of the conquest and an intimate look at the personality of the conqueror. In Renault's view, Alexander's love for Bagoas influenced his desire to unite the Greek and Persian peoples. Renault also posits the notion that Alexander's relentless drive to conquer the world stemmed in part from his troubled relationship with his domineering mother, and his desire to \\"escape\\" from her influence by leading his army ever eastward. The novel is a sequel to Renault's Fire from Heaven (1969). The Persian Boy was a bestseller within the gay community. Plot introduction Like much of Renault's fiction, the book, published in 1972, provides a sympathetic portrait of homosexual love. The Persian Boy is notable for its depiction of the tradition of pederasty in ancient Greece, where relationships between adult men and adolescent boys were celebrated. In the novel, Bagoas is 15 years old when he begins his relationship with Alexander (then about 26). Renault depicts the attachment as lasting until Alexander's death, when Bagoas would have been about 22. She explores the tensions in the triangular relationship between Alexander and his two lovers, Hephaistion and Bagoas, and suggests that Alexander went mad with grief over Hephaistion's untimely death. Allusions/references to actual history The book describes the major incidents of Alexander's later career, such as his conquest of Bactria, the controversy over Alexander's adoption of Persian customs like proskynesis, his abortive invasion of India, his marriage to Roxana, his crossing of the Gedrosian Desert, the death of Hephaistion and his own final illness and death. Bagoas was a historical figure, identified by the Roman historian Curtius as \\"a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate.\\" Plutarch described Alexander's troops, seeing their leader sitting with the boy, as \\"clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.\\" From these and a few other fragments, Renault creates an imaginative portrait of a lover and confidant to Alexander. In a review of The Persian Boy, historian Jeanne Reames wrote: Curtius' history of Alexander presents Bagoas as a vindictive schemer who revenges himself on a Persian noble named Orsines who failed to give him gifts by lying to Alexander about him, eventually succeeding in having him tried and executed. Renault, who accuses Curtius of \\"muddled sensationalism\\" in an author's note, points to other sources who suggest that Orxines (as she calls him) was in fact a \\"murderous\\" character, and portrays him in the novel as fully deserving his fate. The claim by Curtius that Orsines did not plunder the royal tombs but that these sepulchres were devoid in the first place of rich offerings is an absurd one, as Renault points out, and totally unacceptable in the light of our knowledge of Persian culture. Renault also points out that the incident in which the army clamored for Alexander to kiss Bagoas took place very soon after the crossing of the Gedrosian desert, when all those present were survivors of that harrowing incident. Renault argues that Bagoas must have earned the admiration and affection of the army by his courage and fortitude, and his help to others, during the desert crossing.

Christoper Williams entertains the crowds in the Napier Bentley at Mallory Park With its red bodywork and Napier-Railton-esque grille, it is spectacular and entertaining in action. Being a W12, the engine has three banks of four very large stub exhausts, one of which points straight out of the side of the car. The sound of the car has been likened to a World War I biplane or cluster or mortar bombs going off. Due to the immense torque of the engine (c.1,400 ft-lbs), the rear tyres can be made to produce clouds of smoke whenever the car is launched, while the exhausts produce sparks, flames and smoke.

It is located on the Tyne Valley Line (which runs from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle) west of and is managed by Northern. History The station was constructed by the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (N&CR;), and opened on 9 March 1835 as the line's initial eastern terminus.Body, G Railways of the Eastern Region Volume 2, 1988, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough, , p.133 Through running to Redheugh (Gateshead) on the south bank of the River Tyne began in 1837 and the line was completed through to the following year.South Tynedale Railway Preservation Society - A Brief History Of The Newcastle & Carlisle Railway STRPS website article; Retrieved 25 September 2013 A second cross-river line via Scotswood to a temporary terminus near the site of was opened in 1839 (diverging immediately east of the station), although it was not until January 1851 that Central station was accessible via this route. It was enlarged on the opening of the Lanchester Valley Extension line in 1867, with Blaydon Junction opening to its east; this enabled trains to run to Blackhill, and through to . The station was substantially rebuilt in 1912 with new red brick station buildings and glass canopies. Passenger services over the Derwent Valley line ended in 1954 and it closed completely in 1963. In 1969, Blaydon became an unstaffed station, and the canopies were removed. The station buildings were demolished in 1977 due to neglect and persistent vandalism. Services over the route via the Scotswood Bridge were withdrawn on 4 October 1982 and the line closed (few traces of this now remain, though the position of the station signal box gives a clue as to the old alignment); all services were henceforth diverted over the original 1837 route along the south bank of the Tyne and then onward through , Bensham Junction and then over the King Edward VII Bridge, a route that had previously only been used by freight traffic. Facilities As noted above, the station is unmanned and has a single ticket machine on the westbound platform. There are basic shelters on both platforms, which are linked by a footbridge. Train running information is offered by timetable posters and audio announcements. Step-free access is possible on both platforms, although the eastbound platform is only accessible via a considerable detour across the adjacent level crossing.

The highway connects the northern end of Highway 410 just north of Brampton with Owen Sound on the southern shores of Georgian Bay, passing through the towns of Orangeville and Shelburne as well as several smaller villages along the way. It historically followed the Toronto‚ÄìSydenham Road, part of which later became Hurontario Street, as well as Prince of Wales Road. The highway was established in 1920 as one of the original provincial highways. It was extended south by 1937 to Highway 2 in Port Credit. That same year, it became the site of the first highway interchange in Canada at its intersection with The Middle Road. Since the late 1990s, the southern portion has been truncated to its current terminus north of the Brampton‚ÄìCaledon border.  Route description  Highway 410 ends as Highway 10 beginsThe northern terminus of Highway 10 in Owen Sound Highway 10 through Caledon Highway 10 follows a route originally carved through the virgin forests of Upper Canada in 1848. Its route has remained largely unchanged since that time, and the highway still divides many of the towns it serves, with the exception of Orangeville, which it has been routed around. It acts as the meridian for the Regional Municipality of Peel; parallel sidelines are divided into East and West in several cases by the highway. Beginning at its southern end in Caledon, Highway 10, following the Hurontario Street alignment, passes to the west of Valleywood, a suburban community on the fringe of the Greater Toronto Area. The highway presses northwest and rises gently over the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve. Immediately to the west are the Forks of the Credit, a deep glacial ravine and provincial park regarded for its scenery. The highway passes between several large quarries and enters Caledon Village. Continuing, it reaches Orangeville at Highway 9. The highway passes to the east of Orangeville on a bypass, switching between the Hurontario St. and Prince of Wales Rd. alignments, avoiding the business district. At the north end of the bypass, the highway curves and proceeds directly north towards the village of Primrose at Highway 89. Highway 10 turns west, becoming concurrent with Highway 89 for a short distance, into the town of Shelburne. The concurrency ends in the centre of Shelburne, as Highway 10 splits and turns north and then resumes its northwesterly course. From Shelburne to Owen Sound, the road follows the northernmost part of the former Toronto‚ÄìSydenham Road, a colonization road that predates the division of the land in this area. As such, the road follows a diagonal path to the survey grid. It briefly merges with Ontario Highway 6 in Owen Sound before it ends, while Highway 6 goes on to Tobermory.  History  Historically, Highway 10 follows the 19th-century stagecoach route known as the Toronto‚ÄìSydenham Road (the southern half of which later became absorbed into Hurontario Street), which travelled north from Dundas Street (later Highway 5) in Cooksville through Brampton, Orangeville and Shelburne to Owen Sound. It was first designated as a provincial highway on February 26, 1920 when the newly formed Department of Highways assumed the road. It was later extended south when the provincial government assumed the remaining stretch to Lakeshore Road (Highway 2) in Port Credit, on the north shore of Lake Ontario. At that point, the total length of the highway was 166 km. The highway formerly turned west onto Highway 9 and ran concurrently with it through downtown Orangeville along Broadway, then turned north to follow First Street (the Prince of Wales Road alignment). In 1968, the bypass around Orangeville was completed, bypassing a short section of the Hurontario Street alignment, which is today a dead end providing access to a hotel. Colloquial reference to Highway 10 in the name of a restaurant in Mississauga In 1998, due to the combination of increasing urbanization and the presence of the parallel Highway 410 (and a short north-south section of Highway 403) through most of the corridor, the provincial government repealed the connecting link agreement for the southernmost 31 km of the highway running through Brampton and Mississauga, which was already effectively under the control of their respective municipal governments. However, the street is still often colloquially referred to by the former highway number in these cities. In 2009, Highway 410 was connected to Highway 10 about 500 metres north of Highway 10's southernmost terminus at the border of Brampton. The 500-metre \\"orphaned\\" segment is now discontinuous, and while still technically part of the highway, is only linked to the rest of the highway via a connecting road, and is signed only as \\"Hurontario Street\\" rather than with both the street name and highway number. Also in 2009, a major project to widen two-lane sections of the southern portions of the highway was completed, and the highway is now four lanes wide from Highway 410 north to Camilla. From Shelburne north to Owen Sound, it remains a two-lane highway with several passing lanes in hillier regions. During winter, the northern stretches of the highway that pass through the snowbelt region of Grey County are subject to poor visibility and road closings during windy conditions or winter storms.

He has been the editor of numerous newspapers and has authored five books.Books by Siderov __TOC__ Early life Siderov was born in 1956 in Yambol, Bulgaria. He received an undergraduate degree in Applied Photography in Sofia, and before the fall of Communism in 1989, worked at the National Literature Museum as a photographer. His brother, Dr. Plamen Siderov, is a mathematician and lectures at Sofia University. After the fall of Communism, Siderov became a member of the newly established Movement for Human Rights. During the fall of 1990, he became the editor-in- chief of Democracy (), the official newspaper of the Union of Democratic Forces (Siderov played a major role in establishing the paper as the official publication of the right-wing party). At one point he was appointed deputy editor-in-chief of Monitor, a newspaper of a political orientation that could be described as nationalist and conservative. In 2000, Siderov was presented with the award of the Union of the Bulgarian Journalists. Later, he came to be the host of Attack, a talk show on the Bulgarian cable TV channel \\"SKAT\\". In 2002 Siderov was invited to a controversial anti-globalisation conference in Moscow where he associated with people like Ahmed Rami and David Duke. Rise in politics During the 2003 local elections Siderov ran for mayor of Sofia on the ticket of the marginal National Association-BZNS Party. He received 1,728 votes, or 0.45%. That attempt passed largely unnoticed for the general public. During the June 2005 parliamentary elections, already a popular TV host, Siderov organised and led the party \\"Attack\\", named after his talk show. The party won 8.14% (296,848 votes) of the total vote, thus becoming the 4th largest party in parliament. In the 2009 elections Attack won 9.4% (395,000 votes) of the total vote. International relations Front National President Marine Le Pen in Paris, May 2011 Siderov reportedly espouses anti-Masonic conspiracy theories, claiming that Masons control the world through puppet regimes, international organizations, and the press. According to Siderov, these forces seek to commit genocide against Bulgarian people. Attack opposes the membership of Bulgaria in NATO; Siderov has declared that the people were lied to, that Bulgaria would be the safest place by then Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs‚ÄîSolomon Pasi‚Äîbut the result was reducing the Bulgarian army to 20,000 troops and in necessity Bulgaria would be defenseless as the Turkish government wants. He compared the accession of Bulgaria to NATO as a new signing of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, considered as humiliating treaty for Bulgaria, signed after World War I. Although the party is ambivalent on Bulgaria's European Union membership, it has demanded a revision of some of the previous agreements (e.g. the resolution on shutting down the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant near the Danube), it claims that those who signed the EU membership, referring to Meglena Kuneva and others, are national traitors, not because of the EU membership itself, but because of the \\"anti-Bulgarian\\" agreements, on which it is signed. Siderov expressed respect to the Russian president Vladimir Putin, by visiting him on foot for his 60th birthday on 7 October 2012. On 8 March 2013 Siderov paid tribute to the deceased president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez at the Bolivarian republic's embassy in Sofia, where he called the revolutionary an 'example for the Bulgarian patriots as a statesman'. Attack insists on the cancellation of Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and the returning of the Western Outlands to Bulgaria, annexed by Yugoslavia after the First World War, which consists of the regions of Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad in Serbia, whose population according to the Serbian national census is predominantly ethnic Bulgarian, and of the region of Strumica in Republic of Macedonia. Siderov said that the treaty is invalid, because it was signed with Yugoslavia in 1919, a vanished state, and does not refer to the present-day Serbia or to the Republic of Macedonia and should be cancelled. The first statement ever of Volen Siderov from the parliamentary tribune, for a plan for a giant genocide of the Bulgarian nation, coming from abroad: In September 2018, Siderov met with Israeli MK Oren Hazan, a member of the Likud party, during the latter's visit to Bulgaria. Hazan defended the meeting by noting that Siderov \\"said he apologized for what he had said\\" about the Holocaust in the past, and Hazan then \\"told him he needed to do it publicly\\".http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/09/25/controverisal-mk-oren-hazan- meets-holocaust-denier-in-bulgaria/ Controversy Volen Siderov at a National Union Attack rallySiderov has generated increasing controversy as Attack has improved at the polls. He has been labeled xenophobic, and his persona has been called \\"a studied imitation of Hitler\\". He has criticised the \\"symbiotic relationship\\" between established political parties and organised criminal groups. He has also spoken against the purportedly \\"widespread discrimination\\" against majority ethnic Bulgarians by their own state, particularly in relation to the alleged non-prosecution by the state of crimes committed by ethnic minorities and the supposed free provision to certain ethnic groups of social services that have been denied to ordinary Bulgarians. Siderov and his party \\"Attack\\" were among the few Bulgarian political forces that opposed the closing of the four units of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. Units 1 and 2 were taken shut down in the end of 2003 and units 3 and 4 were taken out of operation in the final hours of 2006, immediately prior to the country's accession to the European Union. In February 2007, the newspaper 168 Hours published claims that the Movement for Rights and Freedoms has paid BGN 1.6 million to \\"Attack\\". On 23 February 2007 Volen Siderov appeared in the offices of 168 Hours, and asked for an explanation, which was not provided. Attack is suing the newspaper for libel. From time to time Siderov is involved in scandals that include hooliganism. During a televised debate in the show Referendum on Bulgarian National Television (BNT), after arriving late, Siderov questioned the sexual orientation of IMRO leader Angel Dzhambazki, as well as Krasimir Karakachanov's property deals and alluded to what he alleged was underhanded support by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms for the nationalist IMRO party. He continued to speak even after being told to stop by moderators and even after his microphone was turned off. Gendarmerie officers arrived on scene to escort Siderov out of the studio and he was subsequently banned from appearing on the BNT by the channel's management. Bulgaria's council for electronic media referred the case to the country's Central Electoral Commission in an attempt to revoke Siderov's right to access free media packages, which are given to parties in the run-up to elections. Siderov reacted to these actions by accusing the network of censorship. Presidential election 2006 Siderov ran for President in the 2006 presidential election. In the first round on 22 October he received 21% of the vote and qualified for the runoff on 29 October against incumbent Georgi Parvanov, who had 65%. Parvanov was not declared the winner after the first round because, in accordance with Bulgarian electoral law, at least 50% of all registered voters had to take part in the first round for that. Mainstream right-wing parties in Bulgaria (the UDF and the DSB) refused to back any of the candidates, despite appeals by many observers, notably by fellow conservative and European People's Party chairman Hans-Gert P√∂ttering, to support Parvanov (the situation was commonly compared with the way French left voters supported mainstream right-wing candidate Jacques Chirac against far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002). The centrist National Movement for Simeon II ultimately decided to back Parvanov. Meanwhile, some far left formations called their sympathizers to support Siderov. In the second round he lost, receiving about 24% of the vote. 2019 Sofia mayoral run In September 2019, Siderov announced his resignation from Bulgaria's National Assembly, in order to run for the post of mayor of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital and largest city, in the 2019 Bulgarian local elections. During his election campaign he promised that, if elected, he would stop the use of municipal tow trucks for forcefully moving incorrectly parked cars, as well as ban any gay parades, such as Sofia Pride, from being held in the city. Siderov claimed that homosexuality itself \\"did not interest\\" him and that homosexuals could have a private party instead, as he deemed the gay parade was only costing the Sofia Municipality excess money, as the local police is charged with guarding the event. He also stated that he would attempt to save money by creating a local, municipal-run construction company, which would handle public works, instead of auctioning them off to private companies. Siderov believes that with these measures, he could fund free bus passes for all retirees and schoolkids in Sofia. He further pledged to \\"crush\\" street gangs and organized crime in Sofia in only 3 months, stating that voters were free to \\"have his head\\" if he did not fulfill this promise in time. Adding that he thought Sofia needed its own Viktor Orb√°n, he further stated that he believed candidates for mayor should resign their previous posts before standing for election, as he had done with his position in the national assembly. For this reason, he praised Maya Manolova, who resigned from her position as National Ombudsman to run for Mayor of Sofia, but criticised Angel Dzhambazki, another candidate for the position, who refused to give up his seat in the European Parliament. During the vote counting process, he arrived at Arena Armeec, where the votes were being tallied, and insisted he be allowed in to monitor the process. He was denied entry by the policemen guarding the arena and left after a long argument with the authorities, which told him that Bulgarian electoral law makes no provision for political candidates to monitor the counting process. He finished seventh with 1.44% of the vote. Personal life Siderov's hobby is collecting books and various map types related to Bulgaria.

A hard-hitting batsman and off spin bowler, Smith was rated highly in West Indies. He idolised Jim Laker, for which reason he was nicknamed \\"Jim\\" for a time.Wisden 1958, p. 60. Test career In his third first-class match, he hit 169 for Jamaica against the touring Australians in 1954‚Äì55, and was immediately included in the side for the First Test. He started his Test career scoring 104 on debut against Australia. But after a \\"pair\\" in the next match, he was dropped. He returned for the Fourth and Fifth Tests, and finished the series with 206 runs at 25.75 and 5 wickets at 68.00.Wisden 1956, p. 863. He toured New Zealand in 1955‚Äì56, scoring 64 in the First Test and putting on 162 for the fourth wicket with Everton Weekes in 100 minutes. He was less successful with the bat in the next three Tests, finishing the series with 78 runs at 15.60, but his off-spin brought 13 wickets at 18.53, including 2 for 1 and 4 for 75 in the Second Test.Wisden 1957, pp. 829‚Äì38. In England in 1957, he scored 161 in the First Test and 168 in the Third Test, once driving Brian Statham into the car park. He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year; in his citation he was praised for his batting, bowling, and \\"magnificent fielding\\".Wisden 1958, p. 59. In 1957‚Äì58 he made 283 runs at 47.16 and took 13 wickets at 38.00 against Pakistan in the West Indies.Wisden 1959, pp. 805‚Äì6. In India in 1958‚Äì59 he scored 287 runs at 35.87 and took 9 wickets at 29.66. In the Fifth Test at Delhi he scored 100 and took 3 for 94 and 5 for 90. In the three Tests in Pakistan he was less successful, scoring 81 runs at 16.20 and taking 3 wickets at 20.00. Death During 1958 and 1959 he played for Burnley in the Lancashire League where in 1959 he set a league record of 306*. He died from injuries sustained in a car accident in 1959 at the age of 26. The accident happened at 4:45am on 7 September, while he was travelling with his West Indian teammates Garry Sobers and Tom Dewdney. They were driving to London to attend a charity match, Sobers being the driver. The trip had already been delayed because of the traffic. The car ran into a 10-ton cattle truck driven by a Mr. Andrew Saunders. The accident happened on the A34 near Stone in Staffordshire. Smith was sleeping in the back seat and was thrown forward. His injuries seemed minor initially and Smith even told Sobers, in reference to Dewdney, \\"Don't worry about me. Look after the big fellow.\\" But his spine was injured badly and he soon went into a coma. He died without regaining consciousness three days later. His body was taken to Jamaica where 60,000 people attended the funeral. His tombstone in Jamaica's May Pen Cemetery is engraved: \\"Keen Cricketer, Unselfish Friend, Worthy Hero, Loyal Disciple, Happy Warrior.\\"Dewdney reflects on Collie Smith's life Retrieved 8 May 2013 Sobers and Dewdney were not seriously injured, suffering lacerations and bruises. Sobers was issued with a notice of intended prosecution. On 11 November at Stone Magistrates' Court, Sobers was found guilty of careless driving. The prosecutor said that Sobers had failed to take a bend and was in collision with a cattle truck travelling in the opposite direction. Sobers was fined ¬£10 with ¬£16 17s costs and had his licence suspended for a month. Sobers pleaded not guilty, claiming that he had been dazzled by oncoming headlights. A biography titled The Happy Warrior was written by Ken Chaplin a year after Smith's death. He had the nicknames \\"Mighty Mouse\\" and \\"Wayside Preacher\\" because he liked reading the lesson in church. The road passing Boys Town Club in Trench Town, Smith's birthplace, is named Collie Smith Drive in his memory.

It was originally written for the Atari ST and later ported to the Amiga in 1990 by Andy Fowler.Trip-A-Tron, Hall Of Light ‚Äì The database of Amiga gamesAtari ST Trip-A-Tron, Advert scans, Atari Mania Description Trip-A-Tron was released as shareware, but also came in a commercial package with a 3-ring-bound manual and 2 game disks. The trial version contained no limitations, but registration was necessary to obtain the manual, which in turn was necessary to learn the script language (\\"KML\\" - supposedly \\"Keyboard Macro Language\\" and only coincidentally the phonetic equivalent of \\"camel\\") which drove the system. The software has a usable but quirky user interface, filled with in-jokes and references to Llamasoft mascots. For example, the button to exit from the MIDI editor is labelled \\"naff off\\", while the button to exit the file display is labelled with a sheep saying \\"Baa!\\"; the waveform editor colour cycles the words \\"Dead cool\\" above the waveform display, and the event sequencer displays an icon of a camel smoking a cigarette; and the image manipulation tool has a series of icons used to indicate how long the current operation is going to take: \\"Make the tea\\", \\"Have a fag\\", \\"Go to bed\\", \\"Go to sleep\\", \\"Go on holiday\\", \\"Go to Peru for six months\\", and \\"RIP\\"; and the scripting language command to set the length of drawn lines is \\"LLAMA\\". (The manual states: \\"I could have called the command LINELENGTH I suppose, but I like llamas so what the heck\\".) The manual is also written in a similar light, conversational style, but has been praised for nonetheless achieving a high degree of technical clarity. In spite of this the software is extremely usable and was recommended as one of the best light synthesizers available at the time.1988, Adrian Wagner (2) / Jeff Minter - Merak - The Video (VHS), Discogs, A Music Suite/Llamasoft Product, All graphics generated on the 'Trip-A-Tron' light synthesizer program created for the Atari range of computers.1096: Colourspace, By Pete, I'm Not Doctor Who, One thing that does stick in my mind from Trip-A-Tron, however, is a peculiar artistic project Minter undertook with a musician named Adrian Wagner known as Merak.
