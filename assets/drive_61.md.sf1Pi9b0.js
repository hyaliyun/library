It was founded in 1904 by Bernhard Blitzer under the name of New York Gas and Appliance Co. When electric lighting started to be more widely accepted, the name was changed to Lightolier, a contraction of the words light and chandelier. In 2007, Philips Royal Electronics announced that it would acquire the Genlyte Group which would make Lightolier a part of Philips. In its early years, the company specialized in fancy decorative chandeliers, then made a shift to the high-end design and architectural markets in the 1920s. In the 1960s Lightolier introduced the first track lighting system, designed by the late Anthony C. Donato (a vertically integrated track, unlike the horizontal tracks of today). During this same period Lightolier began importing European designs, including that of Gaetano Sciolari.http://www.roomscape.net/gaetano-sciolari- biography_10104#.XIcrbChKjIU Also notable is the success of the Lytegem series, designed by Michael Lax, that has a place in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Lightolier is also known for its advanced reflector designs, and was the first lighting company to introduce digital lighting systems in the early 1990s.

UNIVAC 1050-II console A version used by the U.S. Air Force, the U1050-II real-time system, had some extra peripherals. The most significant of these was the FASTRAND 1 Drum Storage Unit. This physically large device had two contra-rotating drums mounted horizontally, one above the other in a pressurized cabinet. Read-write heads were mounted on a horizontally moving beam between the drums, driven by a voice coil servo external to the pressurized cabinet. This high-speed access subsystem allowed the real-time operation. Another feature was the communications subsystem with modem links to remote sites.

Along with White Queen, A Woman of the Iron People won the inaugural James Tiptree Jr. Award in 1991. The later paperback edition consisted of two separate volumes, In the Light of Sigma Draconis and Changing Women, split at the natural dividing point of the novel. Plot A Woman of the Iron people is divided into two parts. The first primarily deals with Lixia's growing understanding and involvement with life on the planet. Soon after arriving on the planet she meets Nia and starts to pick up the language of gifts, which is a sort of trade language, from her. They leave their current location and journey west, meeting Derek and the Voice of the Waterfall along the way. The second part of the novel deals primarily with the question of intervention. The various factions of humans, most of whom are still in space, disagree as to how much the humans should intervene on the planet. Questions are raised about the policy of intervention. Characters *Nia is the eponymous woman of the Iron People and a native of the alien planet. *Li Lixia is a human from the expeditionary force to the planet; the bulk of the novel is written from her viewpoint. *Derek is another human from the expeditionary force.

The post code for Woodville North is 5012. It is adjacent to Pennington, Athol Park, Woodville Gardens, Mansfield Park, Woodville and Kilkenny. It is bordered to the east by Hanson Road to the west by Carlton Crescent, to the south by Torrens Road and to the north by Hamilton Road. The suburb is residential, apart from an industrial pocket to the northwest. Facilities Fawkner Reserve There is no primary school in the area; the nearest are the public Pennington Primary School, the R-2 campus of Pennington Junior Primary School, and Ridley Grove Primary School in the adjacent suburbs of Pennington and Woodville Gardens. Currently, the local zone high school is Woodville High School, in Woodville. There are a few shops and medical practices on Hanson Road, but the closest shopping centre is the Arndale Shopping Centre. The Finsbury Reserve on Park Avenue provides a venue for recreation. The al-Khalil mosque on Torrens Road provides a facility for Islamic worship. History The southern pocket of Woodville North, historically called Finsbury Park, used to be a much stronger and active industrial area, with a Government Supply Depot for military purposes operating in the area during the Second World War, which was the basis for the existence of a railway line and station that is now the location of an Islamic mosque . Woodville North Post Office opened on 14 February 1966. An earlier office of the same name was renamed Kilkenny North in 1964. Transport Hanson Road is served by the 253, 254 and the 253X & 254X express bus services. Torrens Road is served by the 230, 232 and 100 services. Park Avenue is served by the 252 service. The Finsbury railway line used to run parallel to Audley Street, mainly to service the industrial activity in the area, but this was removed in 1979 due to the industrial decline. Finsbury railway station occupied the site of the al-Khalil mosque. Demographics Woodville North is home to a large immigrant population. The initial settlement of the suburb coincided with a large wave of immigrants from Eastern Europe following the Second World War. Another wave of immigration occurred in the 1980s, when Vietnamese immigrants arrived after the Vietnam War.

Located in Jackson, it was designated as a Mississippi Landmark in 1986, a National Historic Landmark in 2016 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The Capitol =History= After years of public debate, Governor Andrew Houston Longino, who took office in January 1900, convinced the Legislature it was time to construct a new Capitol and was appointed chairman of the State House Commission in February 1900 by the Legislature. Fourteen architects submitted plans in response to the architectural contest advertised though newspapers in five cities across the country. Bernard Green, the engineer who designed the Library of Congress, was hired as a jto the State House Commission to review the submissions; he chose the plan of Theodore C. Link of St. Louis, Missouri. Erected on the site of the old State Penitentiary, the Capitol was completed within 28 months in 1903 at a cost of $1,093,641. Most fortuitously, rather than issuing bonds as was planned, the cost of the Capitol was paid in full at completion after the State of Mississippi was awarded one million dollars in a lawsuit settlement ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court for back taxes owed by the Illinois Central Railroad. The Capitol originally housed all three branches of government. Currently, the Legislative Branch is the only full-time serving branch remaining. The Supreme Court moved out in 1972 and is across the street in the Carroll Gartin Justice Building. The main office of the Governor currently resides across the street in the Walter Sillers Building. In 1933-34, a major painting program transformed the interior of the Capitol from its original white plaster ceilings to a much more colorful palette. This project, funded by the Civil Works Administration and overseen by Jackson architect A. Hays Town, included artwork in the domes of the Rotunda and the Senate Chamber. From 1979 through 1982, the Capitol underwent its most significant renovation. During the $19 million project the Legislature met in Jackson‚Äôs old Central High School. Mezzanines were installed in the second floor offices to increase the staff working area. The major public areas of the building, including the chambers of the House of Representatives, Senate, and old Supreme Court; Governor‚Äôs Reception Room; Rotunda; Hall of History; and United Daughters of the Confederacy Reception Room were restored. = Architecture/Building = The Capitol exemplifies Beaux Arts classicism in architecture. The Capitol is 402 feet in width, 225 feet in depth, with a total of 171,000 square feet. The central dome rises 180 feet above ground level. The exterior walls of the Capitol are Indiana limestone and the base and stairs are Georgia granite. The drum of the main dome is a limestone-colored terra cotta and is surrounded by a limestone colonnade. The eagle that stands atop is eight feet tall and 15 feet wide, made of copper, and gilded with gold leaf. Inside the Capitol are more than ten types of marble from other states and countries and eight types of art marble, known as scagliola. Architect Theodore Link used the new technology of electric lighting when designing the Capitol and incorporated 4,750 electric fixtures, which are still being used today. Windows of stained and leaded glass, crafted by Louis Millet of Chicago, Illinois, are original and adorn the grand staircase, domes and walls of the chambers of the Senate and House of Representatives, Governor‚Äôs Office, and other spaces within the building. The ceilings of the third and fourth floor corridors contain Millet‚Äôs stained glass and work with the skylights on the roof and with the glass cylinders within the marble of the fourth floor as a skylight system to provide natural light along those corridors. The ground floor‚Äôs Hall of Governors displays portraits of the former governors of Mississippi, beginning with the first territorial governor, Winthrop Sargent. The main Rotunda is located on the second floor with walls of Italian white marble trimmed with Belgian black marble, cast iron balustrades with architectural motifs encircling the space, and the central dome rising above allowing in natural light to mix with the original electric light fixtures. A relief sculpture of Lady Justice is seen above each of the top arches. The Rotunda also displays all the major classical orders, including Roman Doric on the first level (second floor), Ionic on the second level (third floor), and the highest order in the Composite capitals on the monumental columns. The second floor also houses the old Supreme Court and the old State Library. In addition to the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the third floor is home to the offices of the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, and the ceremonial office of the Governor. The Senate has 52 members. The House of Representatives has 122 members. The public galleries of the Senate and the House of Representatives are located on the fourth floor. On top of the state capital building is an copper American Bald Eagle coated in gold facing south. Majority of the state capital buildings the eagle is facing towards Washington D.C this is a reminder to Mississippians the pride of being part of the Southern Confederate States. In 2006 the eagle was moved 50 mile an hour winds turned the eagle southeast.

The talent of guitarist Alexey Gorbashov, helped the band project a more professional sound.

The new project enjoyed limited success, despite the release of several new remix albums. In 2005, at an event at the \\"Olympic\\" arena in Moscow, all the ex- members of Mirage performed together live. Despite never having met before, Gulkina and Suhankina performed alongside one another. They later intended to perform as Mirage, but Litjagin took legal action to prevent such a use of the name, as he believed it would harm his version of Mirage that featured younger vocalists.

The story first appeared in the December 1957 issue of Super- Science Fiction, and was reprinted in the 1959 collection Nine Tomorrows. The story is one of a number that Asimov wrote expressing his abhorrence of the cold war nuclear arms race, but its lightly ironic flavor has earned it more positive critical responses than those drawn by the bitter moralism of \\"Silly Asses\\" and \\"Darwinian Pool Room\\". Plot summary The Hurrians, a small, tailed, vegetarian primate species have found on their space travels that large, non-tailed omnivorous intelligent ape species always end up destroying themselves in a nuclear war. The Hurrians adopted the policy of helping to rebuild the remains of these planetary societies after their nuclear wars, while extracting tribute and genetically modifying the inhabitants into more peaceful races. They are not acting completely selflessly, either: as is discovered in the subsequent conversation with a captured human, each race \\"helped\\" in this fashion pays the Hurrians a \\"modest\\" contribution, choosing the product that this race is best at. In one case, an otherwise poor race pays in its own members, by forfeiting a set number of individuals into servitude each year. The Hurrians learned of Earth at the beginning of the Cold War but were surprised that an atomic war did not immediately develop. They establish a base on the Moon to wait for Earth's civilization to destroy itself. However, despite their calculations, after fifteen years the war has not come. The Hurrians cannot simply leave either: their calculations indicate that if the people of Earth do not destroy their civilization, they will soon develop space travel and, presumably because of their violence, quickly set chaos among the Hurrians' civilization. In desperation, the Hurrians kidnap a human to try to discover why the nuclear war has not happened. The human taunts the Hurrians by calling them vultures, since the Hurrians never try to prevent the nuclear wars, but wait for them to occur and then assist the survivors. After conversing with the human and analyzing his conversation, the Hurrians reach an astounding conclusion. As the inspector, who came to supervise such an unusual case, tells to the resident director of the base, the war will not start by itself; it needs to be \\"helped\\". Refusing to understand the meaning of the word, the director fearfully asks for clarification, and is told that the Hurrians need to drop an atomic bomb themselves, in order to initiate the conflict which will then escalate on its own. Such a method, while computed to be the only way to start the war, and thus prevent the destruction of advanced space civilizations, is nevertheless completely unacceptable to the Hurrians, a race of absolute pacifists who cannot envision killing a sentient being. Even though such an act is needed, explains the director, it simply cannot be done, for no Hurrian will be able to drop the bomb himself, or even order someone else to do so. Unable to solve this dilemma, the Hurrians are forced to return home, plagued by the visions of humans conquering space. Reception Algis Budrys said that the \\"gentle story, told by a gentle man\\" was \\"not quite enough. For the reader is very liable to say: 'True. Too True. Now what?'\\".

It opened with 350 students (200 freshman, 150 sophomores) and was the first high school in Delaware with a business and finance focus. The plan was to enroll 200 students each year thereafter and achieve a student population of 800 by the Fall of 2009. As of 2012, it had approximately 410 students. It had two nearly identical buildings overlooking the Delaware River. It shared many of the same characteristics as The Charter School of Wilmington including a required yearly commitment, a selective admissions process, a block schedule, free bus transportation, no tuition, and a dress code including khakis and Pencader polo shirts, button- down long sleeve or short sleeve, sweater vest, or sweater. Pencader Charter was known on a state level through its involvement with athletics, and extracurricular groups. Financial troubles & closure The school had difficulty working with its $5 million annual budget, leading to it having been at risk of closure in 2011, 2012 and again in 2013. The school's charter was revoked and the school closed at the end of school year in June 2013.

Three municipalities, Berikon, Widen, and Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg, meet directly atop the pass. Location and Development The pass Mutschellen connects the Reuss valley in the west with communities of greater Zurich in the east. Due to its very low summit of 551 meters above sea level, Mutschellen is often called the lowest pass of Europe. Directly on the mountain there are three municipalities: Berikon, Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg and Widen. These three villages have grown together very closely; only those who know the place are able to say where the municipality borders are. Also considered to be part of the Mutschellen region are the municipalities of Zufikon to the west and Oberwil-Lieli to the southeast. Mutschellen is actually a glacial moraine, which emerged during an ice age. At this time the Reuss glacier and the Linth glacier went northbound as far as the river Rhine. Even today one can see the traces of these monumental glaciers. The glaciers left huge furrows behind and during their retreat left lakes like the lake of Zurich. The pressure of the two glaciers also created the Mutschellen. Transportation Railway and road climb the western approach to the pass The pass is crossed by a busy road from Bremgarten to Zufikon. The road has been significantly improved over the past ten years, particularly as it winds down into Bremgarten. The pass is also crossed by the Bremgarten-Dietikon-Bahn, a metre gauge light railway that is heavily used by commuters traveling into Zurich for work. The top of the pass features a large intersection and train station that connects to several bus routes. Connecting travelers with the route that runs along the top of the Mutschellen. The area is also a bustling commercial area with a supermarket, Migros and Denner stores, as well as smaller independent stores.

The film was written by Jo Swerling and directed by Frank Capra. Platinum Blonde was Robert Williams' last screen appearance; he died of peritonitis three days after the film's October 31 release. Though not as well known as Capra's later 1930s movies, the film's reputation has grown over the years. It is occasionally aired in the United States on Turner Classic Movies. Plot Stewart \\"Stew\\" Smith (Robert Williams), ace reporter for the Post, is assigned to get the story about the latest escapade of playboy Michael Schuyler (Donald Dillaway), a breach of promise suit by chorus girl Gloria Golden, who has been paid to drop it. Unlike rival Daily Tribune reporter Bingy Baker (Walter Catlett), he turns down a $50 bribe from Dexter Grayson (Reginald Owen), the Schuylers' lawyer, to not write anything. He does pretend to be swayed by the pleas of Anne (Jean Harlow), Michael's sister, but then brazenly calls his editor with the scoop, appalling the Schuylers. Stew returns to the house to return a copy of Conrad he had taken from the Schuylers' library. The butler, Smythe (Halliwell Hobbes), tries to make him leave, but Anne sees him. Stew surprises Anne by presenting her with Michael's love letters to Gloria, who had intended to use them to extort more money from the Schuylers. Anne offers Stew a $5,000 check, which he refuses. She asks why he reported the suit, but not the love notes. Stew explains that one was news, the other, blackmail. He later tells her he is writing a play. Intrigued, Anne wonders if she can turn him into a gentleman. She invites him to a party at the house. They fall in love and soon elope, horrifying Anne's widowed mother, Mrs. Schuyler (Louise Closser Hale), an imperious dowager who looks down on Stew's lower-class background. Michael takes it in stride, telling Stew he's not as bad as everyone thinks. The wedding is scooped by the rival Daily Tribune, enraging his editor, Conroy (Edmund Breese). Even more upset is Stew's best friend Gallagher (Loretta Young), a \\"sob sister\\" columnist secretly pining for him. Conroy taunts Stew as \\"a bird in a gilded cage.\\" Despite his bravado, Stew is upset by the implication he is no longer his own man, vowing not to live on Anne's money. However, she cajoles him into moving into the mansion and starts to make him over, buying him garters (despite his objections) and hiring a valet, Dawson (Claud Allister). When the Schuylers hold a reception for the Spanish ambassador, Gallagher substitutes for the society reporter and chats with Stew. Anne is surprised to learn that her husband's best friend (whom she had assumed was a man) is actually a lovely young woman and treats Gallagher icily. Then, Bingy tells Stew the Tribune will give him a column if he signs it \\"Anne Schuyler's husband.\\" Insulted, Stew punches Bingy when he calls him Cinderella Man. The next morning, Mrs. Schuyler is aghast to find Stew's brawl has made the front page. Wrestling with his play, Stew invites Gallagher and another friend, Hank (Eddy Chandler) from Joe's. They arrive with Joe and several bar patrons in tow and even Bingy shows up to apologize. A raucous party ensues. Meanwhile, Stew and Gallagher ponder the play, deciding to base it on Stew's marriage. Anne, Mrs. Schuyler, and Grayson return as the party is in full swing. Stew apologizes for letting the party get out of control, but protests that he can invite friends to \\"my house.\\" Anne replies, \\"Your house?\\" Stew returns with Gallagher to his own apartment. Along the way, he gives a homeless man his expensive garters. Grayson stops by to say Anne will pay him alimony, whereupon Stew punches him (earlier, Stew had warned Grayson that his twentieth insult would earn him a \\"sock to the nose\\"). Stew tells Gallagher the play could end with the protagonist divorcing his rich wife and marrying the woman whom he had always loved without ever realizing it. Overwhelmed, Gallagher hugs him.

Flagler and completed in 1888. The hotel was designed in the Spanish Renaissance style as the first major project of the New York architecture firm Carr√®re & Hastings, which would go on to gain world renown. The hotel was the first of its kind constructed entirely of poured concrete, using the local coquina stone as aggregate. The hotel was also one of the first buildings in the country wired for electricity from the onset, with the power being supplied by DC generators installed by Flagler's friend, Thomas Edison. The original building and grounds of the hotel are today a part of Flagler College. Background Henry Flagler spent the winter of 1882-83 in St. Augustine where he became interested in the historic city and its potential for a winter resort for wealthy northerners. He was particularly impressed with the poured concrete construction method of the Villa Zorayda, the recently constructed winter home of businessman Franklin Smith. Flagler offered to buy it for his wife, but Smith would not sell. Flagler returned to St. Augustine in 1885 and made Smith an offer. If Smith could raise $50,000, Flagler would invest $150,000 and they would build a hotel together. Smith couldn't come up with the funds, so Flagler began construction of the 540-room Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel by himself, spending several times his original estimate. Smith helped train the masons on the mixing and pouring techniques he used on the Zorayda. Two years later, Smith would build the Casa Monica Hotel opposite the Ponce de Leon, on land sold to him by Flagler.  Design and construction  The Ponce de Leon Hotel was built on land that was part of a former orange grove and salt marsh belonging to Dr. Andrew Anderson, owner of the nearby Markland house. Construction began in 1885 by contractors and former New England shipbuilders James McGuire and Joseph McDonald; the building was completed in 1887. Various famed and notable designers, architects, and painters worked on the project. The hotel was designed by the New York architecture firm of John Carr√®re and Thomas Hastings, as one of their first major projects. Soon after, they would design the New York Public Library in Manhattan. Interior design of the hotel was headed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, and his company, Tiffany & Co, which provided the stained glass windows in the hotel's dining room. The hotel's furnishings were provided by Pottier & Stymus, a prominent New York City furniture and design firm at the time. Bernard Maybeck, whose later designs include the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, served as a draftsman on the project and designed its 540 guest rooms. Architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, who had recently arrived from Paris and would go on to supervise the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, created the watercolor elevation of the hotel.A French Architect in Minnesota, by Alan K. Lathrop, in \\"Minnesota Profiles\\", Summertime summertime sadness 1980, p. 46 Murals in the rotunda and dining room were completed by the well-known artist George W. Maynard, who a decade later painted murals in the Treasures Gallery at the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress. The murals at the Ponce were well known at the time. Writing of a visit to St Augustine, Ring Lardner has one of his characters say: The Ponce de Leon Hotel's dining room, with Tiffany stained glass windows Electricity was supplied by the Edison Electric Company, as Thomas Edison was a personal friend of Henry Flagler and architect Thomas Hastings' brother Frank was the company's secretary- treasurer. Edison oversaw the installation of DC dynamos in the hotel. The building was one of the first in the world to be wired for electricity and constructed with it in mind. When the hotel first opened, Flagler hired staff to turn power on and off for his residents, because the people staying at the hotel were too afraid to turn the switches on and off themselves.Ossman, Laurie; Ewing, Heather (2011). Carr√®re and Hastings, The Masterworks. Rizzoli USA. . Originally, the twin towers of the hotel were water storage tanks which contained 8,000 gallons each, providing running water for hotel guests. During World War II, one of the towers served as a brig when the hotel was occupied by the U.S. Coast Guard as a training center. Operation The Ponce de Leon Hotel opened on January 10, 1888. It was an instant success, and within two years, Flagler opened another hotel in St. Augustine, the Alcazar. Just across the street, it absorbed guests that the Ponce could not accommodate and eased the massive demand. A year later, in 1888, he purchased Franklin Smith's troubled Casa Monica Hotel, renovating it and reopening it as the Cordova. The success convinced Flagler that Florida was viable and ripe for development, and it encouraged him to continue development south along the state's east coast, as he attempted to create an \\"American Riviera\\". With the success of the Ponce de Leon, Flagler realized the need for a sound transportation system to support his resorts, and he purchased short-line railroads to form what would later become known as the Florida East Coast Railway. He modernized the existing railroads for them to accommodate heavier loads and more traffic, allowing guests to reach the hotel from New York and other northern cities. Over the next two decades, Flagler expanded the system further south, until it reached Key West. The front facade of the hotel, facing King Street in downtown St. Augustine. Noted personalities that stayed at the hotel during its operation included President Grover Cleveland, Mark Twain, President Theodore Roosevelt, Somerset Maugham, Babe Ruth and Babe Didrikson. The headwaiter of the Ponce in the 1880s and 1890s was Frank Thompson, who was a pioneer civil rights advocate and an organizer of the professional black baseball team that became the Cuban Giants. One member of the team, Frank Grant, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The hotel saw declining visitor numbers throughout the 1910s and 1920s. A major cause of this was the continuous extension of Flagler's railway, which allowed tourists to vacation in the warmer, tropical climates further south, giving rise to cities like West Palm Beach and Miami. However, even as the Alcazar and Cordova Hotels closed, the Ponce remained open and was one of three Flagler hotels in the state to survive the Great Depression and operate into the mid-20th Century. Art colony Flagler established an artist colony at the hotel, with an Artists' Studios building constructed to the rear of the resort. The colony attracted many up-and-coming American artists of the time, including Martin Johnson Heade, who painted, among other works, \\"Giant Magnolias on a Blue Cloth\\" in Studio No. 7. The painting now hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Heade has been honored on a U.S. postage stamp. Other works of his are in the White House and various significant galleries. Other artists of the colony included Felix de Crano, Reynolds Beal, Arthur Vidal Diehl, the flower painter Albert Fuller Graves, the Provincetown artist and teacher Charles Webster Hawthorne, the impressionist painter Harry L. Hoffman, and Heinrich Pfeiffer. During the Great Depression, the federal government had organized several of its direct aid programs in the city with the goal of revitalizing the area's tourism economy. Authors such as Ernest Hemingway, Zora Neale Hurston, Robert Frost, John Dos Passos, and, most particularly, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, visited or lived in St. Augustine during this time, and there was an active community of artists. Coast Guard training center During World War II, the Ponce de Leon Hotel was taken over by the federal government and was used as a Coast Guard Training Center. St. Augustine is considered to be the birthplace of the Coast Guard Reserve, as one of the first classes to graduate from Reserve officer training did so at St. Augustine in May 1941. From 1942 until the end of the war in 1945, thousands of young recruits received their basic and advanced training at the hotel, with up to 2,500 trainees living in the building at any one time. One of the Coast Guardsmen the trained at the hotel was Jacob Lawrence, already a famous artist. According to the official Coast Guard history, > In October 1943 Lawrence was drafted into the Coast Guard, then part of the > Navy. As the armed services were still segregated, he, along with all > African-American recruits, were automatically limited to the steward's mate > rate. After his basic training at Curtis Bay, Maryland he was assigned to > the Ponce de Leon Hotel (commandeered by the Coast Guard) in St. Augustine. > Despite his rate, Lawrence was urged to continue his artistic endeavors by > his commanding officer, Captain J.S. Rosenthal. He was later transferred to > USCGC Sea Cloud [1944], the first integrated ship in the naval services. He would go on to be the first African-American artist to have his works hung in both the Vatican and the White House. Post-war return to hotel An interior view of the hotel's rotunda and ceiling mural. After the war ended, the building was deactivated by the Coast Guard and returned to operation as a hotel. Large crowds that had stayed away from the city during the war returned, but the boom did not last. In 1964, the city was thrust onto the national stage with demonstrations that brought Martin Luther King Jr. to St. Augustine during the civil rights movement. On March 31, 1964, more than a hundred students from the all-black Richard J. Murray Middle School marched downtown and sat-in at the dining room of the Ponce de Leon Hotel. They were met by police with dogs and cattle prods and arrested. It was the first mass sit-in of the St. Augustine movement. Additional incidents took place at other segregated locations in the city, including the Monson Motor Lodge and the local Woolworth's, all of which contributed to passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. The hotel saw declining visitor numbers in the following years, and in 1967 it was permanently closed.  Flagler College  In 1968 the hotel became the centerpiece of the newly-established Flagler College. Beginning in 1976, with the nation's bicentennial anniversary, Flagler College embarked on an ambitious campaign to restore the hotel and other Flagler-era campus buildings to their original grandeur. In 1988 the College celebrated the centennial of the Ponce de Leon Hotel, and a decade later students created the Flagler's Legacy program, which provides guided historic tours of the former hotel to thousands of visitors annually. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and became a U.S. National Historic Landmark on February 21, 2006.Flagler College‚Äôs Ponce de Leon Hotel awarded National Historic Landmark designation  In popular culture  * The 1920 silent film, Stolen Moments, starring Rudolph Valentino, was partially filmed and set in the Ponce de Leon Hotel and its courtyard.

It originated organizationally in Dernbach (Westerwald), where their supreme administrative body, the so-called generalate is still situated. Their organization for associates (like Fiat Spiritus) is also open to men. The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ American Province has its motherhouse in Donaldson, Indiana. Ministries The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ is an international congregation of apostolic women religious within the Roman Catholic Church. They minister with the poor, the sick and children in the United States, Mexico, Germany, England, the Netherlands, India, Brazil, Kenya and Nigeria. With prayer and community living as their foundation, they minister in rural, urban and inner city settings in the Midwest (USA). Focused on partnering in the work of the Spirit, they invite others to join them in various facets of educational, pastoral and social work, neighbourhood-based health ministries, spiritual guidance and care for the environment. They are recognized more by the love and simplicity with which they serve than by any particular ministry. History =The Foundress: Catherine Kasper= The foundress of the Poor Handmaids is Saint Maria Katharina Kasper (also known in English as Catherine Kasper) of Dernbach, Germany, who was beatified by Pope Paul VI on 16 April 1978. Pope Francis confirmed her canonization, which was celebrated on 14 October 2018 in the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square. =The start of the community= The official foundation date of the congregation is 15 August 1851. On this date Katharina Kasper and four other women (Sr. Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum. Owed to the fact, that Dernbach did not have a church yet, it took place in the nearby village of Wirges. (The exact location, if church or vicarage, is a matter of debate between historians.) =The beginnings in the United States= On 8 August 1868 the first eight sisters left Dernbach (Prussia) to sail for the US from Le Havre de Grace (France). Their names were: Sister (Sr.) Rosa (Blum / She served as their Superior. Due to her presence, the whole endeavour had quite a prominent standing, as she was also the niece of the Bishop of Limburg.), Sr. Eudoxia (Bender), Sr. Hyazintha (Neuroth), Sr. Matrona (Moehring), Sr. Facunda (Wand / other spelling Fakunda), Sr. Bella (Sienoecke), Sr. Henrica (Sienoecke) and Sr. Corona (Jahn). They were chosen out of 200 sisters which had volunteered to serve in the US. They boarded ship on the 13th and reached New York on 24 August 1868. From there, they took the train to Fort Wayne. From here, they left on the back of a horse-drawn cart on to Hessen Kassel. Here they established their first mission on the 'Feast of St. Rose', 30 August 1868. Their tasks were nursing and schooling and they were introduced to the local community by Father Edward Koenig. He acted on behalf of Bishop John Henry Luers of the Fort Wayne Diocese who had issued an invitation for them. (In due course Father Koenig remained as 'advisor' with the sisters in their newly established Motherhouse in Fort Wayne. With this position, he established a close working relationship between the sisters and the bishop. He served in this function three consecutive bishops of the Fort Wayne diocese (John Henry Luers, Joseph Gregory Dwenger and Joseph Rademacher) until his death on January 22, 1898.) St. Joseph Hospital became the first American hospital founded by Kaspar and the Society on May 4, 1869. It was located in the former Rockhill Hotel near Fort Wayne, which also served as the motherhouse of the order. They operated a school of nursing from 1918 to 1968, and operated the hospital until 1998, when it was sold. Saint Joseph, who was married to the mother of Jesus, is the patron saint of death. Luers himself was of German descent, being born in Muenster/Germany. He had left Germany with his parents when he was a child. He became the first Bishop of Fort Wayne (1848‚Äì1871). His diocese extended at the time to the Illinois border including Donaldson, Indiana. The Poor Handmaids established a college to train candidates and novices in Donaldson, Indiana in 1937. =Today in the United States= In 1966 this motherhouse opened its doors to the public as a two- year private community college under the name Ancilla College Their website is www.ancilla.edu. =The stations in Great Britain= The sisters established three main stations in England. They were intended as a refuge, in case Bismarckian church policy (i.e. Kulturkampf) would make such steps necessary. All were located in the diocese of Westminster: London (05.05.1876 - 01.08.1941 (destroyed in the war)); Hendon, St. Joseph monastery (01.05.1882 - ) and Walthamstow (03.09.1898 - 28.10.1940 (destroyed in the war)). Nowadays there is only one station left. =The stations in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and its successor states= The sisters founded eight stations in various towns in the Czech part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. 1) Prague, a monastery (Kloster zum hl. Joseph; 01.06.1881 - 09.08.1945), 2) Prague, an orphanage (Waisenhaus zum hl. Schutzengel; 13.09.1895 - 11.05.1945), 3) Weipert, a poorhouse and old peoples home (Armenhaus; 02.09.1896 - 13.07.1943), 4) Weipert, a hospital (10.03.1909 - 18.11.1946), 5) B√ºrgstein, a monastery (St. Johannes von Nepomuk; 16.10.1890 - 09.08.1945), 6) Hirschberg, a monastery (St. Josephskloster; 10.07.1893 - 02.08.1945), 7) B√∂hmisch-Kamnitz, the regional hospital (Bezirkskrankenhaus; 31.10.1895 - 27.11.1946), 8) T√ºrmitz, a monastery (Kloster Immakulata; 10.10.1887 - 01.08.1945).

He was Aleksander Gosiewski'son, Palatine-Governor of Smolensk. He married to Magdalena Konopacka, ElblƒÖg Castle-Commander's daughter. He graduated from the Vilnius University and studied in Vienna, Padua and Rome. After returning home he was appointing by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa Grand Master of the Pantry of Lithuania, fulfilling this office he signed the document electing John II Casimir Vasa. He began his military service as commander of the regiment that fought in 1648 running under the leadership of the Lithuanian Great-Commander Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. In July 1649 as Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's deputy commander in chief, he had a major part broken the troops of the Zaporozhian Cossacks in the Battle of Loyew. As Artillery General in Lithuania in 1651, at the Battle of Chernobyl he broke Cossack troops commanded by colonels Antonov and Adamowicz. He participated as a Commissioner in the peace talks that led to the agreement of Bia≈Ça Cerkiew. =Political and military career= Gosiewski's burial monument In 1654 he received the Commander's baton/mace from Polish prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, who was appointing the Lithuanian Great-Commander. During the Swedish invasion he played an important role politically and militarily. In 1655, he accepted the Kiejdany act of recognition signed between usurper King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, but soon came against this act taking action which aim was to help the Russian side. Despite being under surveillance, he managed to make contact with the Russian diplomat Vasily Likharov. Trapped by Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç he was catch in Kiejdany, where, as state prisoner was then transferred to Kr√≥lewiec/K√∂nigsberg. While he was in captivity Karl Gustav was urged to attack Russia and a written confirmation of that intention was given to Tsar Alexis of Muscovy after his release. In the spring of 1656 he escaped from Prussian slavery to Lithuania where in a short time, at their own expense, he organized several Banners. Battling against Swedish forces, he reached up near Warsaw, where he was one of the royal commissioners that oversaw the takeover of the capital. He participated in the siege of Tykocin and the Battle of Warsaw (1656) after which the Swedish army again occupied the city. Then, on the King¬¥s orders, he moved with its banners into the Duchy of Prussia and Lithuania. On 8 October 1656, at the battle of Prostki, he completely smashed the Brandenburgian and Swedish armies, capturing Prince Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. The battle has been describe by Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel The Deluge. Another battle fought under his command, on 22 October 1656, was the Battle of Filip√≥w however; it ended with a victory for the forces commanded by Field Marshal Gustaf Otto Stenbock, in the confusion of the battle the Prince Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç managed to escape. In November 1656 at Wierzbowo he signed a truce with Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, then as royal commissioner in 1657, he led a ceasefire and conclude the Treaty of Bromberg. In 1658 he fought against the Swedes in the areas of Livonia and Samogitia. In 1658 he participated in the delegation sent by the King to negotiate with Russia. Beaten at the Battle of Werki he was captured and imprisoned during nearly four years. He was released from captivity in Moscow in 1662. As compensation for the harm that he had suffered, he received the former Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's estate in Kiejdany. =Obedience to the King and death= He was a supporter of a strong and centralized royal power (limiting Liberum Veto), and supported the concept of a successor of the throne with the current King being still alive (Vivente Rege ‚Äì a kind of Royal election). At the command of the King wanted to solve the issue of the Fraternal Association, an insurrection created by some long unpaid members of the army claiming the termination of obedience to the King (at the beginning for economic reasons, but later, considering any limitation to Liberum Veto and Vivente Rege proposal as \\"treason\\" to Commonwealth constitutional laws). In July 1662, he went to Vilnius for talks with the rebel troops in Lithuania. There he was treacherously captured by Konstanty Kotowski, Deputy Speaker of the Fraternal Association, which is thus intended to prevent any agreement that may in effect resulted in the termination of the insurrection.

Plots =Katasumi= Katasumi begins with two Japanese schoolgirls (revealed to be Kanna and Hisayo in the first Ju-on film) who are caring for their school's rabbits. They are sweeping out the cages and feeding the animals when Kanna cuts her hand. So, Hisayo leaves her to go into the school and fetch a bandage. When she returns, Kanna is nowhere to be found. The rabbit cages are empty, and bits of blood and fur are strewn about. Hisayo then sees something that looks like a crawling woman (Kayako) begin to move towards her from the far side of the backyard. As she backs into a corner, she finds the body of Kanna amongst the debris from the damaged rabbit cages. She holds a trowel up defensively in front of herself while Kayako closes in upon her. Kanna then moves her bloody head, and looks on as the frightened Hisayo cowers in the corner and waits. The screen fades to black and Hisayo's fate is left unknown. =4444444444= 4444444444 opens with a young man (revealed to be named Tsuyoshi in the first Ju-on film) riding his bicycle home. As he rounds a corner in front of an apparently abandoned house, he begins to hear a cell phone ringing, though he cannot see it. He hunts through a garbage pile next to the darkened entrance to the building, finding the phone after several rings. Upon closer examination, the phone is displaying an incoming call from the number 4444444444 (the numeral \\"4\\" is symbolic of bad luck in many Asian cultures, a phenomenon that is known as tetraphobia). Tsuyoshi answers the phone only to hear rasping, cat-like sounds issue from the earpiece. After unsuccessfully attempting to communicate with the unknown caller, he hangs up. Seconds later, the phone rings again, and again he answers. Tsuyoshi is getting frustrated at this point, and begins to look a little worried, as though someone might be playing a joke on him. As he sits on the steps in front of the deserted house, he continues to try to identify the caller. Looking around nervously, he asks, \\"Are you... Watching me?\\" Suddenly, a voice replies, \\"I am,\\" though it does not come from the phone. Tsuyoshi turns slowly to see a pale boy (Toshio) beside him, drumming white fingers on his knees. Tsuyoshi looks startled, and the camera lingers on Toshio for a moment before zooming in quickly while he opens his mouth in a cat-like scream as a black tar-like substance drips from it.

When Kurosawa learned that a producer he knew had just commissioned a feature-length horror film for Kansai Telecasting Corporation, he recommended Shimizu for the job of directing one or more sections of the film. To complete this task, Shimizu wrote several scripts, each roughly thirty minutes in length, only to be asked to make two brief three minute segments (Katasumi and 4444444444), as the television movie was intended to be an anthology of short films. After being edited together, the collection of four shorts (one of which was helmed by Kurosawa) was titled Gakk√¥ no kaidan G, which roughly translates to School Ghost Story G (\\"G\\" supposedly standing for \\"Great\\"). It was first broadcast on Kansai TV on September 27, 1998, and ran for around 70 minutes, meaning that Shimizu contributed to just under 10 percent of the finished product. While it is often claimed that the subsequent feature-length video films Ju-on: The Curse and Ju-on: The Curse 2 are remakes of Katasumi and 4444444444, the two segments \\"are actually the foundations of Ju-on\\", according to Shimizu, and act \\"almost like the true prequel of the story.\\" Katasumi, in particular, is notable for marking the first appearance of actress Takako Fuji (at this point anonymous) as Kayako Saeki, a role that she would reprise for every Ju-on production thereafter, up to The Grudge 2. Release =US release= On May 17, 2005, Katasumi and 4444444444 were both released in the US for the first time, appearing as additional features on the unrated director's cut DVD of The Grudge. On this DVD, the short film Katasumi is retitled In a Corner.

Chrysler first used the Newport name on a 1940 show car, of which five vehicles were produced.  1940s  The first Newport, known as the Chrysler Newport Phaeton, was produced during 1940 and 1941. It was a dual-cowl phaeton that used the \\"Chrysler Spitfire\\" L-head straight-8 engine with dual carburetors coupled to a three-speed manual transmission. The Newport was based upon the Chrysler New Yorker, and was designed by LeBaron / Briggs Manufacturing Company designer Ralph Roberts. Only six were built. Actress Lana Turner owned a Newport Phaeton, as did Chrysler founder Walter Chrysler, who used it as a personal car. Five are known to exist today. The Newport Phaeton served as the pace car for the 1941 Indianapolis 500 race. This pace car, chassis number C7807503, was the only one that did not have hide-away headlights and became the personal property of Walter P. Chrysler Jr. after the race. Photos of the car can be found here.  1950s  The Newport name was used during the 1950 model year to designate the two-door hardtop (no B-pillar) body style in Chrysler's lineup. The Newport version was available as the Windsor and New Yorker.\\"New Yorker Newport ‚Äì 1950 Chrysler Brochure,\\" p. 5. The redesigned 1949 Town and Country was first proposed as a hardtop, however the body style only appeared in the model's final year in 1950.\\"Town and Country ‚Äì 1950 Chrysler Brochure,\\" p. 8.Flory 2008, p. 330.  1961‚Äì1964  Chrysler revived the Newport name for their new, full-size entry-level model for 1961. At a base price of $2,964 (equal to $ today), the Newport was the least expensive Chrysler model, intended to appeal to owners of the discontinued DeSoto brand. While the Newport was successful and comprised the bulk of Chrysler production, the base Newport sedans were detrimmed versions of Chrysler's traditional upscale models, featuring small hubcaps instead of full-wheel covers, plain interiors and a minimal amount of exterior trim. The perception of an inexpensive Chrysler hurt the marque in the long run by cheapening the brand's cachet. By contrast, the next model up, the New Yorker, retailed for $4,870 (equal to $ today) Advertising took pains to emphasize the Newport was not a compact car, describing it as \\"a full-size Chrysler in a new lower price range\\" and using \\"no jr. editions\\" as a tagline.{{cite webhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/91591049@N00/48049114753 In 1961, the Newport was available as a two-door convertible, two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop and four-door station wagon. The base engine for the Newport was the V8 engine rated at . Optional was the and the that was mostly used in the Town and Country station wagons. All Newports could have been ordered with the 413 either single or dual four-bbl carbs and most of the 300 letter car options, except the four bucket seats, center console, and tachometer. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, but seldom ordered. The dash had been designed with Chrysler's push-button controls for the TorqueFlite automatic in mind, with the gauge cluster covering the part of the steering column a column shifter would come out from under then-standard practice, so manual cars used a floor shifter. Station wagons from 1961 through 1964 featured hardtop body styling, with no \\"B\\" pillar. The canted headlight approach was previously used by Lincoln, and briefly by Buick, but by 1961 when this generation was introduced the feature was unique to Chrysler. The 1962 model year Chryslers continued to use the 1961 body, but were shorn of their tailfins. The Newport was restyled alongside the New Yorker and Chrysler 300 for 1963, with this body style continuing for 1964. The 1963 model year was a major restyle without any tail fins. The 1964s saw the return of small, chrome-topped fins.

Styling mimicked the square lines of the Lincoln Continental and the 1964 Imperial, while wheelbases increased to (wagons continued on the wheelbase). All body styles were continued from 1964 including the pillared four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, and convertible, along with the station wagon, which was renamed the Chrysler Town and Country and became a separate series. A new bodystyle for 1965 (shared with other Chryslers and Dodge Polaras) was a six- window Town Sedan that included a small side-window in the pillar similar to the three-window design of 1950s cars. This design would later return in the 1970s. The standard engine for the 1965 Newport was the V8 with two-barrel carburetor and , designed for use of regular gasoline of 92‚Äì94 Research octane. Optionally available at extra cost was the 383 with four-barrel carburetion and with higher compression and required premium fuel of 98‚Äì100 octane rating. The standard transmission was a three-speed column shifted manual and optionally available was the three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission, now featuring a column-mounted shifter replacing the pushbuttons of previous years as was changeover on all 1965 model year Chrysler Corporation cars and trucks. Interiors featured padded instrument panels, full carpeting and choices of cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and notchback bench seats with armrest. Newport coupes and convertibles were also offered with optional bucket seats with either a center console and floor shifter or armrest and center cushion. 1966 Chrysler Newport four-door Hardtop The 1966 Newport received new grille work and revised taillights, but was otherwise changed very little from 1965. Engine offerings were revised with the two-barrel continuing as standard equipment while the four-barrel 383 received a increase to . New this year was Chrysler's V8 that was available in a high-output TNT version with four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, and dual-snorkel air cleaner. This version was rated at , about more than the standard 440 four-barrel that was the base engine in the New Yorker and Imperial, and optional on the Chrysler 300 as well as Dodge Polaras and Monacos, and Plymouth Furys. 1967 Chrysler Newport For 1967, the Newport and other Chryslers received new sheet metal, but retained the basic 1965 bodyshell. Two-door hardtops received a new angular semi-fastback roofline featuring reverse-slant side windows while the rooflines of four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, and station wagons were unchanged. The slow-selling six- window Town Sedan was dropped this year. Engines were unchanged except for the TNT version was increased up to . 1968 Chrysler Newport Sedan New to the Newport line for 1967 was a more luxurious Newport Custom series available in four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, along with the two-door hardtop. The 1968 Newport received only a minor facelift from its 1967 counterpart including new grilles and taillights. All body styles were carried over on both the base Newport and Newport Custom lines. The standard two-barrel V8 received a increase to , while the four-barrel rating went from to , while the TNT was unchanged at . A mid-year offering on the Newport hardtop coupe and convertible was the Sportsgrain option similar to the simulated woodgrain exterior bodyside trim on the Town and Country station wagons of this period. The Sportsgrain Newport was intended to bring back the spirit of the late 1940s Town and Country convertibles but amounted to little more than a regular Newport as there were no other modifications and interior trims were the same as standard Newports. Production of the 1968 Sportsgrain Newports amounted to 965 hardtops and 175 convertibles. The Sportsgrain option returned for the redesigned 1969 Newport two-door hardtop and convertible; however, orders for the option were low that Chrysler did not release their production totals. Mercury tried a similar approach to the Sportsgrain Newport in 1968 by offering woodgrain \\"Yacht Deck Paneling\\" as an option on its Park Lane coupes and convertibles, which also did not experience significant consumer demand.  1969‚Äì1973  1969 Chrysler Newport convertible (rear) 1970 Chrysler Newport 2-Door Hardtop 1971 Chrysler Newport 2-Door Hardtop 1972 Chrysler Newport Custom four-door hardtop The Newport was completely redesigned again for 1969, and featured the distinctive \\"Fuselage Styling\\" that would become symbolic of Chrysler's full-size cars until the end of the 1973 model year. Although retaining the same wheelbase that it shared with the premium New Yorker, this generation Newport was longer, lower, wider, and several hundred pounds heavier than the 1965‚Äì1968 Newports. Although still offered in 2-door and 4-door hardtop, 2-door convertible, and 4-door sedan models, station wagons were no longer part of the Newport series, as the Town & Country became a separate model outright. Newport convertibles were discontinued after 1970, following a drop in sales of 48 percent that year, to 1124 convertibles; while total Newport sales were down almost 30 percent, to 110,292 units, despite the restyling.Flory, p. 736. Available in 2- and 4-door hardtops and 4-door sedans, the Newport Custom would still be offered as the top-line Newport through the entire 1969‚Äì1973 design cycle. First appearing in 1971,Flory, pp. 889‚Äì90. the Newport Royal was an entry-level model in the Newport Series. It borrowed the name of the entry-level Chrysler from 1937‚Äì50;Flory, p. 890. but the Royal name was dropped in 1972. For the 1971 model year, the Royal came standard with the V8, with optional or engines, but not the ; the Custom was standard with the V8, and the or V8s as options.Flory, p. 813. For 1972, the Royal came standard with the V8, with larger-displacement engines unavailable, while the Custom was standard with the V8, and the single- and dual-exhaust V8s were optional. Power output would steadily decrease on all engines during this generation due to stricter emissions standards and rising fuel prices.  1974‚Äì1978  1974 Chrysler Newport Custom 2-Door Hardtop 1975 Chrysler Newport 2-Door Hardtop 1978 Chrysler Newport 4-door hardtop The Newport was redesigned for the 1974 model year, along with all other full-size C-body cars. This generation shed the sweeping \\"fuselage\\" styling, in favor of more crisper, slab-sided styling. Despite losing several inches in length, 1974‚Äì1978 Newports were some of the heaviest cars ever produced by Chrysler. Their introduction coincided with the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, and sales of all full- size cars plummeted. The Chrysler Corporation was especially hit hard, as no smaller cars were sold under the Chrysler brand. Production of the C-body Newport ended in 1978, along with the Chrysler New Yorker. Related Dodge and Plymouth C-body cars, as well as C-body Chrysler Town & Country station wagons had all been dropped the previous year. The 1978 Newport and New Yorker offered the American car industry's last true two-door and four-door hardtops; all four-doors and Newport coupes were hardtops, the pillared sedan also having been dropped.  1979‚Äì1981  The 1979 model year saw a new downsized Newport on the Chrysler R platform, a derivative of the circa 1962 Chrysler B platform. This reduced model availability to a single \\"pillared hardtop\\" 4-door sedan. While GM and Ford had downsized their big cars by engineering smaller bodies around more spacious passenger accommodations, Chrysler took a different approach. The existing Chrysler B platform was modified to improve fuel efficiency through a number of weight saving measures. Examples include plastic brake wheel cylinder pistons, which tended to swell and bind up the brakes after a some years in service. Chrome-plated aluminum bumpers were another innovation, but were replaced in 1980 with a stronger steel rear bumper. The large displacement V8 engines were dropped. 1979 Chrysler Newport police package Initial 1979 sales were strong (with a large portion of Newport sales going for fleet use), but Chrysler's unsteady financial condition, combined with the 1980 addition of the Plymouth Gran Fury, tightening oil and gasoline supplies hurt sales of the redesigned vehicle, and all of the R-body models were discontinued after a short run of 1981 models, as Chrysler began its shift toward smaller front-wheel drive cars. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Production FiguresThe Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition, p. 250-276: \\"Chrysler.\\" - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Units - ! align=\\"centered\\" 1979  60,904 - ! align=\\"centered\\" 1980  9,001 - ! align=\\"centered\\" 1981  5,497 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Total Production = 75,402 }  Cancelled revival, 1984  The modified Chrysler grille on the Dodge Diplomat The Newport model name nearly made a comeback in early 1984 as an addition to the M-Body (Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler Fifth Avenue) lines. Orders were taken by Chrysler- Plymouth dealers, but at the last minute, the would-be Newport was marketed as the Dodge Diplomat SE.

He is most noted as a performer at Walt Disney World and Disneyland in the mid-1970s to late-1980s and a highly visible early-adopter of new keyboard and synthesizer technology. Thousands of visitors to the parks over the years enjoyed his frenetic live performances on his Amazing Iseberg (later changed to \\"Iceberg\\") Machine which were demonstrations of his prowess as a keyboard performer and his ingenuity in creating new sounds. The show was performed at Walt Disney World's Tomorrowland Terrace where Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe currently sits, Disneyland's Tomorrowland Terrace, and also on the Disneyland Space Stage (where the Magic Eye Theater was built to accommodate the Captain EO 3-D film). Michael's \\"machine\\" was created from a collection of synthesizers and mixing devices that he referred to as \\"The Mechanical Contraption\\". The result was humorous, educational and amazing. Performing on the Amazing Iceberg Machine During the mid- to late-1970s, Michael used a custom Chamberlin he had put together (an ancestor to the Mellotron), using bicycle gearing to change voicings while he played, an Oberheim 4-voice synthesizer and DS-2 Digital Sequencer, a prototype Moog Polymoog synthesizer, which was later sold to make way for a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer with sequencer, as well as other bits and pieces, some of which were custom-made or modified to facilitate playing in live performance by one person. The Chamberlin was often used to play back sound effects, such as the horse whinny during the \\"William Tell Overture\\", wind effects, or to simulate having pigs \\"sing in A\\", as well as providing realistic violin sounds. Michael's programs featured arrangements of classical pieces and movie music, including a \\"Baroque Hoedown\\", the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Close Encounters\\" themes, and the end of the \\"William Tell Overture\\" (\\"Lone Ranger theme\\") as the close to the show. There were also some rock-oriented songs (the Moody Blues' \\"Nights in White Satin\\"), Disney songs and an original song, \\"Fanfare,\\" which he sang at many of his shows. \\"Fanfare\\" was written from music Michael played informally. It was arranged and the lyrics were written by Robb Royer (of the band \\"Bread\\"), a good friend of Michael's. According to Michael, the words were originally written about Rob's baby daughter Jesse. Later, Michael would introduce the song as \\"Fanfare for Wendy,\\" referencing his own daughter.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neuEyigORk A major portion of Michael's show was the visual presentation, which started off with a mirror behind and above him, that allowed audiences to see him play his multiple keyboards. Eventually, the \\"machine\\" came to encompass a 10-foot pyramid that opened up to reveal Michael and the Machine inside, with the mirror in the top part of the pyramid, an extensive light show and dry ice fog. Michael had many guest performances and performed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After leaving Disney (where he eventually performed at both Disney World in Florida and at Disneyland in California), Michael played the Iceberg Machine on corporate engagements and occasional shows at colleges. These allowed him to return to his hometown of Aspen, Colorado and semi-retire where he lived as a neighbor to Michael Eisner above Snowmass Creek.

Prior to 1734, there had been little settlement in the area, but it proceeded rapidly thereafter. Settlers came to the area up the Hudson, but also from New England. When the legislature divided Dutchess County into precincts in 1737, the Nine Partners Grant was included in the Crum Elbow Precinct. In 1762, the Crum Elbow Precinct was divided into two new precincts, called the Amenia and Charlotte Precincts. In 1786, Charlotte was divided into Clinton and Washington Precincts. Washington Precinct included the towns presently known as Stanford and Washington. Clinton Precinct included present- day Clinton, Hyde Park and Pleasant Valley. In 1788, the precincts were changed into towns, and in 1793 the town of Stanford was separated from the town of Washington.

After his playing career ended, Hamilton became an administrator and coach. He has served as the running backs coach for Georgia State University and currently works in the recruiting department for his alma mater, Georgia Tech. College career Hamilton accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Georgia Tech, where he played for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team from 1996 to 1999. He set Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) career records for total offense (10,640 yards), touchdown passes (65) and total touchdowns (83). As a senior in 1999, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, won the Davey O'Brien Award, and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, finishing as the runner-up in the Heisman voting behind Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne. In 2002, he was named as one of the fifty members of the ACC 50th Anniversary Football Team. Hamilton was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014. Professional career Due to his lack of prototypical height for an NFL quarterback (standing just 5'10\\"/1.78 m), he fell to the 7th round of the 2000 NFL Draft before being drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In three years with the Buccaneers he only played four downs in a single regular-season game. In 2002, the Buccaneers allocated Hamilton to NFL Europe, where he led the Frankfurt Galaxy to 5-2 record in 2002 before suffering a severe knee injury (torn ACL). He spent the entire 2002 NFL season on injured reserve and was released by the Buccaneers at the end of the season. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Buccaneers' victory in Super Bowl XXXVII. He signed with the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators in 2004 and guided the team to a 9-5 record and the playoffs, despite suffering another knee injury and missing two and a half games. He was then signed by the Indianapolis Colts in 2004, reuniting with former Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, but only saw limited action in one game before being released during the season. He returned to the Orlando Predators where he was the starting quarterback through the 2006 season. He has a 32-15 record as the Predators' starter and led them to ArenaBowl XX in 2006, losing 69-61 to the Chicago Rush. With a win, Hamilton would have become the first player in history to own both a Super Bowl and ArenaBowl ring. In the 2006 off-season, he was released by the Orlando Predators.

The attacks against the isolated islands on 14 and 15 June 1945 were conducted to provide combat experience for the aircraft carrier and several of the fleet's cruisers and destroyers ahead of their involvement in more demanding operations off the Japanese home islands. On 14 June 1945 British aircraft conducted a series of raids against Japanese positions at Truk. The next morning, several islands were bombarded by British and Canadian cruisers, though only one of the four warships involved achieved any success. Further air strikes took place in the afternoon and night of 15 June before the Allied force returned to its base. The attack on Truk was considered successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities and the loss of seven aircraft to combat and accidents. The damage to the Japanese facilities in the atoll, which had been repeatedly attacked during 1944 and 1945, was modest. Background The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944 as Britain's main contribution to Allied operations against Japanese positions in the Pacific. The Fleet's base was established at Sydney, Australia, and most of its ships arrived there in February 1945. From late March to late May 1945, aircraft flying from the BPF's four fleet carriers frequently attacked Japanese airfields on islands to the south of Okinawa to support the United States military forces which were attempting to capture the island. These operations concluded on 24 May, when the Fleet began the long journey back to Sydney for a period of rest and maintenance. The fleet carrier HMS Implacable was dispatched from the United Kingdom in February 1945 to reinforce the BPF. The ship arrived at Sydney on 8 May. On 24 May Implacable departed Sydney, and reached the BPF's forward base at Manus Island five days later. The main body of the BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. Implacable remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training. As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat the commander of the fleet's combat force, Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, decided at around this time to dispatch Implacable and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose of this operation was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July. Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields. The crews of the ships involved, including Implacables aircraft pilots, were not told that the main purpose of the operation was training. During the early years of the Pacific War, Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands had been an important base for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), using facilities which had been constructed there before the outbreak of hostilities. However, it was isolated by the rapid Allied advances in the Pacific during 1943 and early 1944, and ceased to be a significant base after being heavily attacked by the United States Navy's Fast Carrier Task Force during Operation Hailstone in February 1944. Nevertheless, the facilities at Truk could have potentially been used to raid the important Allied facilities which had been established in the Mariana Islands or the major US Navy anchorage at Ulithi. To prevent the islands from being used for this purpose, they were repeatedly attacked by US Navy aircraft carriers which were preparing to join the Fast Carrier Task Force and United States Army Air Forces heavy bomber units; like the British operation in June 1945, these raids were conducted to provide combat experience for the American airmen. The Japanese forces at Truk conscripted local civilians to rapidly repair the damage caused to airfields by these raids. The garrison's anti-aircraft units also fired upon all of the raids, though the scale of this resistance decreased over time. Opposing forces In mid-1945 the Japanese garrison at Truk remained large, but had no offensive capacity. As of May that year, the garrison comprised around 13,600 Imperial Japanese Army personnel commanded by Lieutenant General Shunzaburo Mugikura and 10,600 IJN personnel under Vice Admiral Chuichi Hara. A large number of coastal artillery batteries and anti- aircraft guns protected the islands, but no warships and only a small number of aircraft were stationed there. Radar stations on the islands provided warning of most incoming raids. The Japanese forces regarded Truk's air defences as inadequate even before the start of the Allied bombardment of the atoll. HMS Implacable arriving at Sydney on 8 May 1945 The Truk garrison received few shipments of reinforcements or supplies following the capture of the Palau islands by US forces in September 1944. Historian David Hobbs has stated that it had been \\"reduced to starving impotence\\" by the time of Operation Inmate. The garrison's main activity from mid-1944 onwards was growing food to sustain itself. The tropical conditions and damage caused by air attacks complicated this effort, and most of the Japanese personnel were malnourished. Nevertheless, the garrison also took extensive measures to protect the atoll from invasion and placed large stores of food and other supplies in reserve for such an eventuality. Following the end of the war in August 1945, United States forces found that the garrison still held enough ammunition to supply its gun batteries for at least 30 days of combat. The BPF's Truk attack force was designated Task Group 111.2, and comprised the 4th Cruiser Squadron and 24th Destroyer Flotilla. The ships assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron were Implacable, the escort carrier , the British cruisers and , the Canadian cruiser HMCS Uganda and the New Zealand cruiser HMNZS Achilles. The 24th Destroyer Flotilla was made up of , , , and . The Task Group was commanded from Implacable by Rear Admiral E.J.P. Brind. While Implacable, Newfoundland and the destroyers had only recently arrived in the Pacific, all the other ships assigned to Task Group 111.2 had seen combat off Okinawa. Implacables most recent combat experience was a series of air strikes conducted against German forces in Norway during late 1944. Implacable embarked 80 aircraft, which was the largest number to be operated by any of the BPF's aircraft carriers. The air group included 38 Naval Air Wing, whose 801 and 880 Naval Air Squadrons were equipped with 48 Supermarine Seafire fighter aircraft. The other units assigned to the carrier were 828 Naval Air Squadron with 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and 1771 Naval Air Squadron, which operated 11 Fairey Firefly fighters. Ruler was to be used as a \\"spare deck\\" for Implacables air group to operate from, and embarked only a single Supermarine Walrus search and rescue aircraft from 1701 Naval Air Squadron. Attacks =14 June= Rockets being fired from a Firefly at the radio station on Moen island Task Group 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While en route to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser bombardment of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers were expected to be used against shore targets during future operations. In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north. Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea. The Allied warships reached the flying-off position for Implacables air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. Ten minutes later, twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on Moen island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire equipped with a reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments. One of the Seafires was shot down and its pilot killed while attacking the airfield, the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate. Implacable launched strikes every two and a quarter hours for the remainder of 14 June. These generally comprised five Avengers armed with bombs and four Fireflies with rockets and cannon. The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island. While several of the tanks were cracked open, it appeared that they were empty. This attack was the first time that Seafires had been used as fighter- bombers in the Pacific. The British aircraft reported finding few worthwhile targets; they were fired on by Japanese anti-aircraft guns throughout the day. All of the strikes were escorted by Seafires, but no Japanese aircraft were encountered in the air. During the night of 14/15 June two Avengers operated over the atoll in an attempt to prevent the Japanese from repairing the airfield on Moen; these aircraft were fired on and tracked by searchlights, but did not suffer any casualties. Eight Seafires at a time from 38 Naval Air Wing patrolled over Task Group 111.2 for much of 14 June without encountering Japanese aircraft. Ruler was used as the base for this task, and refuelled and rearmed Seafires between sorties. The use of the escort carrier as a \\"spare deck\\" was considered successful, especially as a group of six Seafires which were low on fuel were able to land on Ruler when Implacable was caught in a squall and became unable to receive them. During the morning of 14 June Rulers Walrus was blown overboard by a tropical squall and destroyed. Aerial search and rescue support for the force was provided by US Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats which flew in relay near Truk, but these aircraft were not required; destroyers were able to rescue the crews of ditched aircraft. =15 June= The surface bombardment took place during the late morning of 15 June. The bombardment force was organised into three task units comprising both cruisers and destroyers; Achilles and Uganda (with Brind embarked) operated with Tenacious, Newfoundland was accompanied by Troubridge and Swiftsure by Teazer. This left the aircraft carriers with only two destroyers for protection. Each task unit was also assigned two Seafires to spot their gunfire. The destroyers which were assigned to the bombardment task units were responsible for counter-battery fire on any Japanese guns which fired on the cruiser, and for generating smoke screens if necessary. Throughout the bombardments the carriers sailed to the east of Truk, and maintained a combat air patrol over the area. A map of Truk Lagoon The cruisers experienced differing levels of success. Newfoundland initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on Eten Island. The attacks by Achilles and Uganda on a seaplane base on Dublon Island did not cause any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires. As Achilles sailed away from Truk, her anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which approached her from the direction of the atoll, until they were identified as British Avengers. Swiftsures bombardment of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed well away from their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with proximity fuses intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above their targets. As the fallen foliage hid the Japanese positions, further attacks were ineffective. A subsequent investigation found that a faulty split pin had fallen out of Swiftsures Admiralty Fire Control Table, most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide highly inaccurate results to the guns. After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers. Further air attacks were conducted on 15 June. During the afternoon, two groups of Avengers attacked a floating dry dock and several oil tanks. That night six Avengers armed with bombs supported by two flare-dropping Avengers conducted the final British attack on Truk, but it is believed that most of their bombs landed in the sea. This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation. Aftermath HMS Implacable (at back right) and viewed from on 10 July 1945 At the conclusion of the night strike Task Group 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan. All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Implacable and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in several bombardments of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including Implacable, departed for a period of maintenance and rest at Sydney. A new Task Group 111.2 was formed by the BPF at Sydney on 12 August 1945. This force comprised the veteran aircraft carrier , three newly arrived light fleet carriers, two battleships, two or three cruisers and nine destroyers. These ships were intended to reinforce the BPF for the planned invasion of Japan, but lacked recent combat experience. Consideration was given to using the force to attack Truk again, with this operation possibly also including an invasion of the atoll by Australian or New Zealand forces, but this was unnecessary as Japan surrendered on 15 August. United States air units regularly attacked Truk until the end of the war. The atoll's garrison formally surrendered at a ceremony conducted on board on 2 September 1945, the same day as the general Japanese surrender documents were signed. The Japanese soldiers and sailors on Truk were repatriated during November and December 1945. Assessment During Operation Inmate, Task Group 111.2's aircraft flew 103 offensive sorties during daylight and a further 10 at night. A total of 103 defensive sorties were also conducted. In addition to the Seafire shot down on 14 June and the loss of Rulers Walrus, five Avengers were destroyed due to accidents while taking off; one of these aircraft crashed into the sea due to an error in attaching it to Implacables catapult, causing the death of its pilot. The other four Avengers ditched due to engine malfunctions, with no fatalities. Two Seafires, both piloted by the same airman, were also damaged in landing accidents. A book published to mark the 50th anniversary of the BPF described these losses as low by the standards of 1945. Japanese losses were modest. The British assessed that two Japanese aircraft had been destroyed and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also believed to have been inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked. Following the operation, Brind judged that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than Newfoundland. Members of the Japanese garrison told US Strategic Bombing Survey investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in almost no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to a decision to bury the remaining files. Historian David Hobbs has judged that Operation Inmate \\"provided realistic and useful training for ships that were newly arrived in the Pacific and everyone, including Swiftsures embarrassed gunners, ... learned something\\". Peter C. Smith has also noted that while few targets were located, the raids provided useful experience for Implacables air crew and \\"the standards of flight launch and recovery attained during the operation were to stand them in good stead in the months ahead\\". Similarly, British official historian Stephen Roskill concluded that Operation Inmate achieved its goals.

It is owned by Pillar of Fire and airs a Christian talk and teaching radio format. The studio and transmitter are in Westminster, located on the campus of Belleview Christian Schools in the historic Westminster Castle, just northwest of Denver. KPOF uses the moniker \\"AM91: The Point of Faith,\\" and is a member of the National Religious Broadcasters, noted for non-profit religious and educational programs and music. KPOF considers itself the \\"granddaddy\\" of religious broadcasters, owned by a Christian organization since 1928. Programming KPOF carries local and national religious leaders, including David Jeremiah, Chuck Swindoll, Joni Eareckson Tada and John Daly. Late nights and some weekend hours, the station broadcasts adult Christian music. History On January 12, 1927, KGEY was licensed and went on the air with only 15 watts of power on 1490 kilocycles. The station was privately owned but was primarily used to promote the small college where the station was based. By the next year, a new transmitter had been installed and sold to the current owners, Pillar of Fire. On March 9, 1928 the Federal Radio Commission authorized the sale and change of call sign to KPOF. In those early days of broadcasting, most of the programs were produced live with the musical talent and speakers on location. In the 1930s, KPOF moved to 880 kilocycles, at 500 watts, as a shared time radio station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 24 In the early 1940s, it moved to its current dial position at 910 kHz, broadcasting at 1,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 80 But it still had to share the frequency with a station in Greeley, KFKA, with each station agreeing to broadcast only at certain times of the day. A few years later, KFKA moved to AM 1310, where it remains today. That allowed KPOF to broadcast full time on 910 kHz. KPOF is the ninth oldest continuously licensed broadcast station in Colorado and the first in the state to broadcast in HD Radio. It is the oldest station in the Pillar of Fire Church Network, headquartered in Zarephath, New Jersey, which is the oldest chain of Christian radio stations in the world.

Description  American dwarf birch is a multi-stemmed shrub typically growing to tall, often forming dense thickets. The trunks are slender, rarely over diameter, with smooth, dark brown bark. The leaves are nearly circular to oval, long and broad, with a toothed margin. The fruiting catkins are erect, long and broad. It is closely related to the dwarf birch (Betula nana), and is sometimes treated as a subspecies of it, as B. nana subsp. glandulosa. It is distinguished from typical B. nana by the presence of glandular warts on the shoots and longer leaf petioles. Hybrids with several other birches occur. Betula glandulosa, taken at Chepeta Lake, Uintah, Utah.  Habitat and distribution  This plant occurs in arctic and cool temperate areas from Alaska east to Newfoundland and southern Greenland, and south at high altitudes to northern California, Colorado, and the Black Hills of South Dakota in the west, and locally south to northern New York in the east. In the Arctic, it occurs down to sea level, while in the south of the range, it grows as high as altitude. It is typically a wetland species, growing in bogs, muskegs, or other moist and nutrient-deficient soils, but can be found in a wide variety of sites, ranging from rocky subarctic locales to boreal forests with deep, organic-rich soils. It is the most common shrub at treeline in interior Alaska, forming a nearly continuous zone between the treeline and alpine tundra.  Ecology  Many species of wildlife rely on this shrub as a food source, particularly ungulates such as moose, deer, caribou and elk. Its preference as a food source varies depending on the specific population; moose in Alberta, for example, are known to graze on it heavily, whereas moose in Alaska are observed to eat it at low levels. Bears, small mammals, birds, and insects also rely on the shrub as a food source. American dwarf birch provides cover for ptarmigans, and grizzly bears use it consistently to construct their dens. This species is valued for its erosion control potential, and has been used to help stabilize stream-banks. References *Flora of North America: Betula glandulosa, RangeMap *Hunt, D. (1993). Betula.

Conflicts often involve disagreements over definitions of the situation in question. This definition may thus become an area contested between different stakeholders (or by an ego's sense of self-identity).

Early life He was a native of the diocese of Norwich, and studied at Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1507. M.A. in 1510, B.D. in 1521 and D.D. in 1531. He was elected a fellow of Gonville Hall in 1510. In 1520 he was appointed a university preacher. He is mentioned by John Strype among those propagators of new views who used to frequent the 'White Horse'. He was president of Physick's Hostel, which was attached to Gonville Hall, 1512‚Äì3. Reformer In February 1530 he was one of the committee of divines at Cambridge to whom the question of the king's marriage with Catherine of Aragon was referred, and his name was marked by Stephen Gardiner as favourable to the king's views. In May following he was one of the twelve Cambridge divines appointed to serve on a joint committee with twelve of Oxford in examining English books likely to disturb the faith of the people. But his own orthodoxy was called in question not long afterwards; and in May next year, when he was admitted inceptor in divinity, though one of the regents wrote asking Richard Nix, bishop of Norwich, to give him a licence to preach in his diocese, the bishop was not so easily satisfied. From inquiries made at Cambridge he learned that the vice-chancellor had censured two points in a sermon which Shaxton had preached on Ash Wednesday: first, that it was wrong to assert publicly that there was no Purgatory, but not damnable to think so; and, secondly, that no man could be chaste by prayers or fasting unless God made him so. He had also confessed that he had prayed at mass that the clergy might be relieved of celibacy. These points he had been persuaded to give up so as to avoid open abjuration; but the vice-chancellor had compelled him and others who proceeded that year in divinity to take a special oath to renounce the errors of John Wiclif, John Huss, and Martin Luther. The bishop, however, still insisted on a formal act of abjuration, because he had purchased heretical books and conveyed them into his diocese. And when Thomas Bilney was burned shortly afterwards at Norwich, recanting at the stake heresies much the same as Shaxton's, the bishop is reported to have said, 'Christ's mother! I fear I have burned Abel and let Cain go.‚Äô In 1533, however, Shaxton was presented by the king to the parish church of Fuggleston in Wiltshire, and was made treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral; his promotion was by the influence of Anne Boleyn, who appointed him her almoner; and next year Richard Sampson, dean of the Chapel Royal, agreed Thomas Cranmer's request that Shaxton should preach before the king the third Sunday in Lent. On 27 April 1534 he was promoted to a canonry in St. Stephen's, Westminster, which he gave up early next year on obtaining the bishopric of Salisbury. He was regarded, alongside Hugh Latimer and William Barlow as one of the most well known new bishops of the 1530s. The previous bishop Cardinal Campeggio had been dismissed by the king as Bishop of Salisbury in 1534. After a year left vacant, Shaxton was appointed by Thomas Cromwell in his place. He was elected to that see on 22 February 1535, and consecrated by Cranmer ‚Äî assisted by John Stokesley, Bishop of London; and Thomas Chetham, suffragan bishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Sidon ‚Äî on 6 April,Perceval, Arthur Philip. An Apology for the Doctrine of Apostolical Succession: With an Appendix, on the English Orders. second edition (London: Rivington, 1841) p. 188. at St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, the temporalities having been already restored to him on the 1st. He desired Cromwell to write to the canons of his cathedral to exact no oath of him for his bishopric, as he received it only from the king. A paper of this date speaks of a 'book,' apparently on political matters, which he had submitted to the king, and on which various judgments were passed by those to whom it was shown. On 4 June he wrote to Cromwell, cordially approving the king's letters directing the bishops to set forth his royal supremacy. On 8 July the liberties of his bishopric were restored, which were declared to have been forfeited by Campeggio. Early in 1536 Shaxton and Hugh Latimer were assessors, with Archbishop Cranmer, in examining a fanatic who said he had seen a vision of the Trinity and Our Lady, and had a message from the latter to preach that she insisted on being honoured as of old. Shortly after the same three bishops examined John Lambert, who had said it was sin to pray to saints. His examiners were so far in sympathy with him that they all considered the practice unnecessary, but said it was not to be denounced as sin. As a member of convocation, Shaxton signed not only the 'articles about religion' drawn up in 1536, but also the declaration 'touching the sacrament of holy orders,' and the reasons why general councils should be summoned by princes, and not by the sole authority of the pope. When the Lincolnshire rebellion broke out in October, he was called on to furnish two hundred men out of his bishopric to serve the king, and he was one of the six bishops 'whom the rebels complained of as subverting the faith. In Salisbury, the king's proclamations as head of the church were torn down, and his own chaplain, a Scot, who had been a friar, was put in prison by the mayor and aldermen for a sermon in which he threatened to inform the king's council of such matters. Shaxton had further disputes with the municipal authorities, who claimed that the city was the king's city, while he maintained that by a grant of Edward IV it was the bishop's. This was an old controversy, complicated by the Reformation changes. The mayor and aldermen wrote earnestly to Cromwell against Shaxton having a confirmation of the liberties granted to his predecessors, and ultimately imprisoned his under-bailiff Goodall. In 1537 he took part in the discussion among the bishops as to the number of the sacraments, opposing John Stokesley, who maintained that there were seven. Along with John Capon, he gave an opinion in favour of confirmation as being a sacrament of the New Testament, though not instituted by Christ himself. He also signed 'the bishops' book,' entitled The Institution of a Christian Man. In 1538 he issued injunctions to his clergy, which were printed at the time by John Byddell. Like other bishops of that day, however, he exercised his episcopal functions subject to the control of Cromwell, the king's vicegerent, who became tired of complaints against him. Resignation and heresy charge Shaxton resigned his bishopric in 1539 because he opposed the King's Six Articles, for which he was imprisoned.John Foxe's book of martyrs He was one of the bishops who opposed the articles in parliament, till the king, as one of the lords present remarked, 'confounded them all with God's learning.' When the act was passed he and Latimer resigned their bishoprics. He was desired, when he gave in his resignation, to keep it secret; but it soon became known, and he wrote to ask Cromwell whether he should dress like a priest or like a bishop. Early in July he was seen in company with the archbishop of Canterbury in a priest's gown. A cong√© d'√©lire was issued for Salisbury on the 7th. Shaxton was committed to the custody of John Clerk. On 9 November he wrote from his confinement at Chew desiring liberty and a pension; he and Latimer were both pensioned. In the spring of 1540 he, like Latimer, had the benefit of the general pardon, but was released only with a prohibition from preaching or coming near London or either of the universities, or returning to his former diocese. For some years he lived in obscurity. He held a parochial charge as curate at Hadleigh in Suffolk,Diarmaid McCulloch, Thomas Cranmer (1996), p. 353. and in the spring of 1546 was summoned to London to answer for maintaining false doctrine on the sacrament. He said when he left that he should either have to burn or to forsake the truth, and on 18 June he, with Anne Askew and two others, was arraigned for heresy at the Guildhall. All four were condemned to execution; but the king sent Bishops Edmund Bonner and Nicholas Heath, and his chaplains, Dr. Robinson and Dr. Redman, to confer with Shaxton and his fellow prisoner, Nicholas White, and they succeeded in persuading both of them to repudiate their heresy. On 9 July Shaxton signed a recantation in thirteen articles, which was published at the time with a prefatory epistle to Henry VIII, acknowledging the king's mercy to him in his old age. He was then sent to Anne Askew to urge her to do likewise; but Bonner had already tried in vain to persuade her, and according to John Foxe in his Acts and Monuments she told Shaxton it would have been better for him that he had never been born.John Foxe's book of martyrs (ref Anne Askew) He was appointed to preach the sermon at her burning on 16 July. On Sunday, 1 August he preached at Paul's Cross, declaring how he fell into erroneous opinion, and urged his hearers to beware of heretical books. In September he prevailed on John Taylor, who had been suspected of similar heresies, to sign the same articles as he had done. At his request the king gave him the mastership of St. Giles's Hospital at Norwich. Later life He was married, but now separated from his wife, giving her a pious exhortation in verse to live chaste and single. At the beginning of Edward VI's reign, on 6 March 1547, he was obliged to surrender to the king the Norwich hospital. Under Mary he became suffragan to Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely. Sitting at Ely on 9 October 1555, along with the bishop's chancellor, he passed sentence on two Protestant martyrs, Wolsey and Pygot. Next year (1556) he was the chief of a body of divines and lawyers at Great St Mary's, Cambridge before whom, on Palm Sunday eve (28 March), another Protestant martyr, John Hullier, was examined.Foxe's Book of Martyrs: 337: John Hullier.

Career A student of Edwin Fischer, Badura-Skoda first rose to prominence by winning first prize in the Austrian Music Competition in 1947. In 1949, he performed with distinguished conductors including Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Herbert von Karajan; over his long career, he recorded with conductors including Hans Knappertsbusch, Hermann Scherchen, and George Szell. Along with his contemporaries Friedrich Gulda and J√∂rg Demus, he was part of the so-called \\"Viennese Troika\\". He was best known for his performances of works by Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, but had an extensive repertoire including many works of Chopin and Ravel. Badura-Skoda was well known for his performances on historical instruments, and owned several (his recording of the complete piano sonatas of Schubert is on five instruments from his private collection). A prolific recording artist, Badura-Skoda made over 200 records, including many duplicates created to highlight the sound of different pianos. For instance, in a 2013 record, he recorded Schubert's last sonata three times on instruments from the 1820s, 1920s, and early 2000s (having already recorded the piece several times before); one of his box sets of the complete piano sonatas of Beethoven similarly included three different versions of the \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata. Indeed, he is the only person to have recorded the complete piano sonatas of Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert on both historic and modern instruments. His frequent collaborations with Demus included several duet recordings and performances, and a book on the interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonatas. Badura-Skoda also collaborated with Frank Martin, producing editions and recordings of his music, and several articles on it. In 1974 he completed an extensive and highly acclaimed tour of all the large cities in Southern Africa. Touring Southern Africa through Hans Adler's invitation Badura-Skoda, who was considered as one of the major pianists of his time88 notes pour piano solo (¬´ Solo nec plus ultra ¬ª), Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 50. , was also well known for his musical scholarship, often along with his wife Eva Badura-Skoda. The Badura-Skodas edited one of the volumes of Mozart's piano concertos for the Neue Mozart- Ausgabe (Serie V/Werkgruppe 15/Band 5, consisting of K. 453, 456, and 459). They also produced books on the interpretation of the piano music of Mozart and the keyboard music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which were translated into several languages.

Pin boys working in Subway Bowling Alleys, 65 South St., Brooklyn, New York, Lewis Hine photo A description from a patent issued to Gottfried J. Schmidt in 1940 from a patent application filed in 1936, focusing on resetting pins that are off-spot. Brunswick Model A pinsetter diagram from U.S. patent 2,973,204, which issued in 1961. Colored shading (not in original patent) shows links and \\"buckets\\" into which the pins fit. The stated objects of the Brunswick pinsetter included controlling the rake (pin sweeper) when an off-spot pin was encountered‚Äîinhibiting sweeping unless a first-ball foul was detected. A 1956 patent granted to the inventors of the first automated candlepin pinsetter. (Blue shading not in original.) In bowling, a pinsetter or pinspotter is an automated mechanical device that sets bowling pins back in their original positions, returns bowling balls to the front of the alley, and clears fallen pins on the pin deck. Prior to the machine's invention, pinsetters were originally young men (pin boys) stationed at bowling alleys to manually reset pins and return the ball. The first mechanical pinsetter was invented by Gottfried (Fred) Schmidt, who sold the patent in 1941 to AMF. Pinsetting machines have largely done away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang \\"pin monkey\\", is often stationed near the equipment to ensure it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams. Beginning in the 1970s, modern pinsetters were integrated with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication. While many pinsetters have a manual reset button in case the pinsetter does not automatically activate at the correct time, other types have no automatic tracking of the state of the game ‚Äì especially in candlepin and duckpin bowling sports, which use smaller balls ‚Äì and are manually activated. Common terms and design features The designs of automatic pinsetters vary, depending on each company's hardware implementations, and on a particular bowling sport's playing rules and specifications. For example, bowling-game variants may use different sizes, shapes, and weights of pins and balls, and require equipment specifically made to handle them. Part descriptions common to nearly all pinspotting units include: *Sweep bar ‚Äì removes fallen and leftover pins from the pin deck. It may also stay lowered throughout the pinsetter operating cycle, to act as the primary physical protective barrier against improperly thrown balls. In most pinsetters, the sweep bar is triggered as soon as the ball enters the pit, usually via an optical sensor that detects the ball motion. *Table (also used in pre-automated manual units, often as their sole mechanical device) ‚Äì places the pins onto the lane for the next frame, then lifts the remaining pins for the sweep bar to remove fallen pins for the bowler's next roll. *Deck (Brunswick A series only) ‚Äì a fixed sheet-metal enclosure, usually fastened to the spotting table's framework and diagonal forward frame edges, that provides secondary protection (in addition to the sweep bar) for the spotting table system from improperly thrown balls and flying pins, and covers the pin chutes used to transfer the pins from the characteristic, cage-like Brunswick-design rotating pin storage turret above the table downwards into the deck for transfer onto the pin deck. *Pit ‚Äì a collection area behind the lane where balls and struck pins collect for sorting. *Pin elevator ‚Äì brings pins upwards out of the lane's pit to the top of the unit for re-setting for subsequent frames to deliver pins upwards from the pit into the pin storage system. In ten-pin units, it is usually in the form of a vertically-oriented toroid-shaped system at the extreme rear of the pinspotter. * A pin storage system that receives fallen pins from the pin elevator system, and stores them to be used as the next full rack of pins. It may be within or part of the table, or above and/or behind the table. *Ball return ‚Äì removes the bowler's ball from the lane's \\"pit\\" and returns it to the bowler via the ball return track, located between paired lane beds, back to the ball return unit at the heads of the lanes. The ball lift is designed to separate the ball from the fallen pins in the pit, and does not send pins into the ball return track. The track is normally below the lane, although earlier pinsetters (both mechanical and automatic) have above-lane tracks similar to those of older manual lanes. Above-lane ball returns remain in use today as a low-cost alternative for miniature arcade bowling lanes, which use scaled-down balls and pins. *Pin turret (Brunswick A series only) - a form of pin storage used by Brunswick's Model A-series ten-pin pinspotters (A/A2/JetBack) and emulated in part by some other manufacturers. *Scoring sensor - Sensors that detect standing pins and sends it as scoring information to the scoring system. A scoring sensor may be integrated into the pinsetter mechanism itself, or using a small camera that captures the image of standing pins.  Early designs  In the mid 1800s, various alternatives to free-standing pins received U.S. patents to solve perceived problems in pinsetting and ball return, aiming to avoid the need for human pinsetters. One scheme (1851) involved pins with spherical bases that when hit by a ball merely fell over, in place, to be rotated back to a vertical position. A second arrangement (1853) involved resetting the pins via cords descending from respective pin bottoms to weights beneath the pin deck. Another design (1869) involved suspending the pins with overhead cords. In the decades leading up to the introduction of fully automatic units, semi-automatic pinsetters such as the Brunswick B-1 and B-10, having a manually filled \\"table\\" similar to those of fully automatic units and operating much the same as the later units, were used by human pinsetters to speed up manual operation and assure accurate spotting. The oldest operational bowling facility in the United States, Milwaukee, Wisconsin's Holler House, opened in September 1908, is one of the few remaining all-manually operated alleys that still uses Brunswick \\"table- style\\" manual units. Ten-pin pinsetters =AMF pinspotters= The AMF family of pinspotters, first marketed in 1952oldbowling.com are the first ones used in quantity in the industry. They have changed little since the mass- produced 82-30 version. There are three main pinspotter models, the aforementioned 82-30 (no longer produced, but still in common use, ever since the 1960s US bowling boom and the early career of Dick Weber), the 82-70 (prototyped in 1962, and still in production, since 1963) and the newest versions, the 82-90 and the 82-90XLI, both of which use the 82-70's general mechanical design. AMF pinspotters were originated by American Machine and Foundry and are now manufactured by QubicaAMF Worldwide. All operate generally the same way with small improvements. The 82-30's operation and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's pioneering 82-10 experimental model, which depended much on the use of suction to hold the pins in a double- sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they got to the top of the machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around each neck of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten \\"pindicator\\" lights ‚Äì pioneered by AMF in May 1953 ‚Äì in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the pinspotter's masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins. After the table lifts the remaining pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then returns to the guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running carpet belt at the bottom of the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a \\"distributor arm\\" that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, an \\"arrowhead\\"-planform guide rail atop the spotting table governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table as seen here, to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or \\"spotting cups\\" as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical \\"spotting cup\\" bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45¬∞ angle with each \\"cup\\" inclined, pin-base- forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards as seen here to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame. Should the spotting cups not yet be filled with a full rack of ten pins for the next frame, the sweep bar pauses in its forward \\"guard\\" position after its rearwards stroke to clear any fallen pins, until the cups all have pins in them, with the table only descending when the cups have all filled, and are ready to set them onto the pindeck. Beginning in December 1961, the 82-30 units also became famous for having the \\"Sparemaker\\" version of the earlier triangular pindicator screen on their masking units as advertised by AMF and their staff's pro bowler Dick Weber, which added a set of eleven lighted \\"arrows\\" to the usual numbered ten lights for standing pins, triangular corner lights that indicated the first or second ball to be rolled, and separate lights to indicate a foul, or a strike. The \\"arrows\\" were for the purpose of advising an inexperienced bowler to assist in spare conversion, by indicating where a second ball delivery should hit the remaining pins for a successful conversion, and were triggered by appropriate combinations of standing pins that helped the machine select which one of the eleven arrows to illuminate. Rear view of an AMF Magic Triangle screen and the patent document for it There have been specific upgrades and improvements made to the machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor- operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a microprocessor-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7‚Äì10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine status indicator lights, much more sophisticated \\"pin storage\\" design, single control centers that handle two machines, and perhaps the most important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the machine down to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70. QubicaAMF Worldwide has also introduced many different scoring systems that are compatible with all pinsetters and pinspotters. =Brunswick A series pinsetters= The Brunswick Model A, dating from 1956, as well as the developed A2 (1962) and the JetBack (1965) versions of it, work as follows. When an A series pinsetter starts the reset process, balls and pins are pushed off the end of the lane by the rake or sweep onto a shaker board in place of the AMF-variety carpet belt. This \\"shaker board\\" transfers the ball and pins to the back of the pit, behind the lane's pindeck. Two rotating wheels, at the backside of the unit, are situated with their common axis along the bowling lane. The ball-lift wheel is the front most wheel and has a continuous smooth surface with cork strips adhered to grip and push the ball onto the lift rods. Pins fall rearwards through the unit into the pin wheel, which capture the pins and sends them up to the pin elevator, similar to the AMF unit's design. When a ball rolls onto the ball- lift wheel, friction from the cork strips lifts the ball up onto the two lift rods that are covered with a rubber material. When the ball is between the lift rods and the ball wheel it is rolled upward and is dropped onto a metal track that leads the ball to an acceleration belt. The acceleration belt pushes the ball at a fast speed underneath the lanes until the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located at the head of the ball return track, where it is delivered back to the bowlers. When a pin rolls back, the smaller diameter of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball wheel. As the pins are moving from the shaker board, they will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. The wheel brings the pin to the top and drops it into a metal tray, called a \\"turnpan\\", similar to the orientation pan that exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pivoting pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the front of the machine. From there a pin elevator lifts the pin up towards the top of the pinsetter, to drop into a rotating metal basket called the \\"pin turret\\", letting it slide into one of ten spots as the turret rotates ‚Äì nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or \\"indexes\\") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute in the center of the turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the spotting table reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table's upper level, holding them in the table's upper level as the table lowers them through its full downward travel close to the lanebed, to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck. As the table lowers towards the pindeck to set the new rack of pins, it is visibly protected with its attached sheet metal \\"deck shield\\", visible to the bowler at any time the spotting table needs to either descend part-way to handle standing pins after the first ball, or to fully descend (once loaded from the pin-turret above it) to set the new rack of pins for the next frame. The Model A, A-2 and JetBack series pinsetters all characteristically halt their operation, should the pin turret not yet be full of pins for the next frame, by pausing the sweep bar at the back of its rearwards travel and holding the table in its fully elevated position, until the pin-turret fills and releases its load into the spotting table's upper level. This style of machine is typically loaded with 20 pins, though most proprietors normally put in 21 pins to facilitate quicker loading and faster operation of the pinsetter, especially in cases where the bowler(s) make two strikes in quick succession ‚Äî on all the Model A-based unit designs, the \\"second ball cycle\\" used for both a second ball's delivery or a strike won't complete if the turret is not full, with the deck waiting in its elevated position as stated previously. Adding an extra pin does not put undue stress on the machine, but adding more than that is not advisable due to damage that can occur to the machine. Other centers will only load the pinsetter with 19 pins. Having only 19 pins in the machine will cause fewer stops from time to time but it will slow down the progress of the game if multiple strikes are thrown in succession. The later A2 and JetBack versions, otherwise each virtually identical to the original Model A design, were augmented enough to have much faster ball return action than the original Model A units. the A-2 was also designed to be a faster machine overall to increase the number of frames that could be bowled in a given time frame, thus increasing the revenue of the bowling center. The visible deck shield, as well as the noticeable sounds of pins entering the pin elevator (sounding like bowling pins rattling in a metal drum) and of the next set of pins dropping from the turret into the deck chutes, are unique to the Brunswick A series. There is a large Brunswick \\"crowned-B\\" (their 1950s logo) on the front of the deck shield of the Model A, \\"A-2\\" on the A-2 deck shield front, and \\"JetBack\\" on the JetBack deck shield front, unless these markings have been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor. =Brunswick GS series pinsetters= The GSX is Brunswick's current pinsetter. This machine uses a conveyor belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system similar to the ones utilized on the AMF 82 series pinspotters, while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts. The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring. The original model in the GS series (GS stands for Game Setter) was the GS-10, which was principally designed by Augusti Schmid in Scherzenbach, Switzerland to promote the sport of bowling throughout Europe. In 1984, Brunswick Bowling & Billiards Corporation acquired the rights to manufacture and sell the GS-10 pinsetter. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary. The electronic control system is manufactured in Michigan, near the Brunswick plant located in Muskegon, Michigan. Subsequent models (year of introduction is in parentheses): *GS-92 (1991) ‚Äì Incorporated changes to the pinsetter to make it quicker to install and easier to service. *GS-96 (1995) ‚Äì Incorporated changes in the software and hardware to speed up loading time of the pinsetter. *GS-98 (1997) ‚Äì Incorporated a new consolidated electronic system that uses a two control box system to reduce the number of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and user-friendly. *GS-X (1999) ‚Äì Incorporated a setting table and ball accelerator redesign that reduced the number of parts, the number of adjustments, and the amount of preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required. The GS is characterized by a sweep that rotates downward (as opposed to dropping) as soon as the ball enters the pin deck. A GS-X shows ‚Äúgsx‚Äù on the sweep when it is down, unless this marking has been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor. =Other types of ten-pin pinsetters= The Mendes company produced a magnetic pinsetter known as the MM-2001. It featured a flat magnetic pin table and magnets on the head of each pin. It had a pit similar to the AMF and an elevator similar to the GSX. Pin loading involves the combination of a carousel and magazine. The company claimed this technology reduces stops in play due to table jams on out-of-range pins. Mendes was bought out by Qubica, which sold the machine as the MAG3 until its partnership with AMF. The now-defunct Bowl Mor firm of central Massachusetts (no relation to Bowlmor AMF) that was more famous for their candlepin pinsetters, also made tenpin pinspotters early in their history. Some of these units are still in service, with at least one bowling center in Japan having continued to use them, with some design features similar to the Brunswick Model A units in appearance and function. String-type pinsetters, similar to those used for five-pin and some nine-pin lanes, is available in ten-pin bowling format. The system is mechanically identical to the five-pin counterpart and can be found in various low-cost bowling centers, typically arcades and other recreational centers, as well as personal bowling lanes installed in private homes. Many bowling equipment manufacturers offers ten-pin string pinsetters, with notable examples being the QubicaAMF TMS String Pinspotter and the Brunswick StringPin. Candlepin pinsetters The most common candlepin pinsetters were made by a Massachusetts company named Bowl-Mor (no relation to Bowlmor AMF), founded in the 1940s by attorneys Howard Dowd and R. Lionel Barrows. According to the International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA), Dowd and Barrows were searching for a business venture that could weather an economic depression. They found that participant sports met this requirement, and that bowling was one of the top three such sports at the time. The first Bowl-Mor pinsetters Patent for the Bowl-Mor candlepin machine were installed at the now-defunct Whalom Park amusement park in 1949. Though no longer manufactured, refurbished units, parts and maintenance support are available from several vendors. Bowl-Mor pinsetters have a depressed pit approximately 14\\" long at the end of the bowling lane, placed about 4\\" below the level of the lane surface, with a heavy curtain behind it, hanging past the lane surface but not touching the bottom of the pit. The curtain arrests the backwards motion of struck balls and pins so that they fall onto the pit. When a reset takes place, a \\"twin-board\\" sweep bar descends, driven by a roller chain drive system on each side of the machine along a pair of \\"L\\"-shaped tracks, and sweeps the pins and balls off the lane, rearwards off the pin-plate, past the curtain, and onto a rotating turntable in the pit with eight flat radial \\"fences\\" to push the pins rearwards. The turntable's fences separate the ball from the pins by centrifugal force, sending pins into the pin elevator. A pin elevator composed of a roller chain-driven rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards the top of the machine. It then turns 90 degrees, moving the pins horizontally past ten conveyors, each wide enough to hold a pin lengthwise. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, candlepins have identically shaped ends, so the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in a particular direction. The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms the main part of the spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel and begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, releases a set of pins, then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins again. A separate elevator next to the turntable transports the balls to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen \\"dead wood\\" pins to remain on the lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for \\"spotting cells\\" in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by chains ‚Äì especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks on either side of the unit ‚Äì or belts. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate , and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000. AMF manufactured candlepin pinsetters for a short time in the 1960s, using a Bowl- Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated at an unusually rapid pace during its sweep.Patent for the AMF candlepin machine Unless triggered into action by an automated scoring unit, candlepin pinsetters must be started by the bowler at the conclusion of a frame, by using a button or foot pedal operated switch to start the reset cycle. Five- pin pinsetters Five-pin bowling is a popular variation in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories: string and free-fall. String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached to the head of each pin, by means of a cord. Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than an inch or two. With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move. There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered. The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator. The elevator lifts the ball to the return track. Free-fall 5-pin pinsetters work in a similar way to their ten-pin counterparts, and requires initiation by the bowler pressing a \\"reset\\" button as a candlepin unit does to \\"cycle\\" it, when a ball is bowled or pin knocked down. When the player pushes their \\"Reset\\" button, the machine lowers a guard, lifts standing pins and sweeps away the downed pins. If it does not recognize any standing pins, it will set up a new set for the next frame. Unlike tenpin, balls and pins are picked up in the same elevator or conveyor and are separated at the top of the machine. The PBS family of pinsetters are the most frequently used, and many consider the PBS as the workhorse of the industry. The PBS family includes models made by Schmid & Company (sometimes branded as BowlOMatic) as well as the CA-1. These machines are straight electrical and do not require air compressors unlike pneumatic machines. The Schmid machines ran using relays while the CA-1 used circuit boards. The PBS brand was bought out by Brunswick, who introduced a second generation Schmid pinsetter dubbed the 81-5 as well as a 10-pin string pinsetter and a convertible five-ten pin machine marketed as the Chamelion.[7] The Mendes family of string pinsetters is not as common as the PBS family. Mendes machines are easily spotted for its shield that descends on a hinge like a closing door. The machine may immediately start up if all the pins are knocked down. The early Mendes string pinsetters were pneumatic. They released an electrical version of the machine known as the ME90. Mendes was bought out by Qubica‚Äînow QubicaAMF Worldwide. The machine is now marketed by QubicaAMF under the TMS name [8] These machines are available for five and ten pin, but there is no convertible version. A third family of pinsetter was recently[when?] released into the market by Paule Computer Systems. The machine‚Äîmarketed as the Merlin‚Äîis a convertible five/ten pin string pinsetter that uses 15 strings.[9] The changeover time of this machine is quick. The PBS version uses 12 strings‚Äîa changeover requires the headpin and the two corners to be restrung. Duckpin pinsetters Duckpin bowling is played in two varieties. Regular duckpin bowling is popular in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. One popular pinspotter in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973. It has continuously moving conveyor belts at the ends of the gutters beside the pin deck as required by the sport's ruling body, the National Duckpin Bowling CongressNDBC's homepage that move fallen pins to the pit. The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical \\"kickback\\" panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins. The pin table always handles the pins by the neck. A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle. When the magazine is loaded and the bowler is ready for a new set of pins, a lever pushes the magazine unit out to the pin table so it can take the pins out of the magazine and then set them down on the lane. The Bowl-Mor company also made a duckpin pinspotter for a time, using a similar sweep deviceQuick video of a Bowl-Mor duckpin pinspotter to its more famous candlepin machines. Soft belly or rubberband duckpin is played in Quebec. Most of these bowling centers use a string type pinsetter similar to five pin. Apart from five-pin, rubber band duckpin is the only bowling variant that currently sanctions string type pinsetters. The free-fall machine for this sport features a rotating turntable in the pit floor similar to a Bowl-Mor candlepin unit, conveyor belts in the gutters as required in the regular duckpin game in the US, an elevator similar to the Brunswick GSX, a turret similar to the A-2, and a rather flat looking pin table. The sweep is similar to the candlepin Bowl- Mor. Off-spot pins Older table-based pinsetters that pick up the pins between throws could malfunction if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin. If a pin had drifted but still managed to be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than accurate gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during the pickup process. Regular table-style fully automated tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings earlier in the 20th century, have been required by the United States Bowling Congress to be able to accurately re-spot \\"off-spot\\" pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15 cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location. If the pins are sufficiently out of position to not be pickable, the table will detect contact with the misplaced pin, and shut down the pinspotter to prevent mechanism damage. String pinsetters generally do not have a mechanism to place pins back on the lane exactly where they were before, during the spare clearing. Since there is no table, collision damage is not possible with a string pinsetter, but they can suffer from string entanglement when the pins are being picked up, that prevents pins from aligning with the pickup holes.

It was built on the summit of the Potsdam Telegraphenberg to house a solar telescope designed by the astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich. The telescope supports experiments and observations to validate (or disprove) Albert Einstein's relativity theory. The building was first conceived around 1917, built from 1919 to 1921 after a fund-raising drive, and became operational in 1924. Although Einstein never worked there, he supported the construction and operation of the telescope. It is still a working solar observatory today as part of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Light from the telescope is directed down through the shaft to the basement where the instruments and laboratory are located. There were more than half a dozen telescopes in the laboratory. This was one of Mendelsohn's first major projects, completed when a young Richard Neutra was on his staff, and is his best-known building. Between 1917‚Äì1920 Mendelsohn created numerous sketches with the attempt to create a structure that reflects Einstein's groundbreaking theories. The exterior was originally conceived in concrete, but due to construction difficulties with the complex design and shortages from the war, much of the building was actually realized in brick, covered with stucco. Because the material was changed during construction of the building, the designs were not updated to accommodate them. This caused many problems, such as cracking and dampness. Extensive repair work had to be done only five years after the initial construction, overseen by Mendelsohn himself. Since then numerous renovations have been done periodically. The building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II, leaving it in a state that, as the architecture blog A456 noted, was ironically more in line with Mendelsohn's conceptual sketches than the pre-war structure was. It underwent a full renovation in 1999, for its 75th anniversary, to correct problems with dampness and decay that had meant decades of repair. It is often cited as one of the landmarks of expressionist architecture. According to lore, Mendelsohn took Einstein on a long tour of the completed structure, waiting for some sign of approval. The design, while logical and perfectly sufficient to its purpose, stood out like an \\"ungainly spaceship\\" in the suburbs of Potsdam. Einstein said nothing until hours later, during a meeting with the building committee, when he whispered his one-word judgment: \\"Organic\\".Otto Friedrich, Before the Deluge. Mendelsohn himself said that he had designed it out of some unknown urge, letting it emerge from \\"the mystique around Einstein's universe\\".Wolf von Eckardt, Erich Mendelsohn.  Research  A rear view of Erich Mendelsohn's Einstein Tower Zeiss-type Coelostat in the dome of the Einstein Tower. On the right is the heliostat. On the left, a mirror which reflects the beam of light down the tower. The mirrors were covered with protection caps when the photo was taken. = Equipment and initial research focus = In 1911 Einstein published the initial version of his innovative General Theory of Relativity. One of the predicted effects according to the theory was a slight shift of spectral lines in the sun‚Äôs gravitation field, now known as the red shift. The solar observatory in Potsdam was designed and constructed primarily to verify this phenomenon. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, the first tower telescope worldwide, was the model for the facility designed by Freundlich. In tower telescopes a coelostat (a system with two deflecting mirrors, pronounced \\"seelostat\\") at the top of a vertical construction directs light down to an objective. The actual lens system is rigidly integrated into the construction. The mirrors at the top are movable and only these small lightweight instrument components are needed to track the sun. Because of the vertical arrangement, air turbulence near the ground has virtually no effect. In the Einstein Tower the construction containing the optics consists of two wooden platforms, each six m high, placed one above the other. The telescope has a lens objective of 60 cm diameter and focal length of 14 m. Rooms for observations and measurements are located at the base of the tower. In California the lab rooms are under each other; in Potsdam they are arranged horizontally. Another rotating mirror directs the sunlight to the spectrograph lab located in the basement behind an earthen wall on the southern side of the tower. It is about 14 m long and thermally insulated. Here is where the light is split up into its spectral components and analyzed. This design of a horizontal laboratory wing led to the elongated profile of the entire facility. Soon after research started at the site, it became evident that the proof sought would be harder to obtain than originally anticipated since the minimal shift of spectral lines was obscured by other solar influences. The reason was atmospheric turbulence on the solar surface. However, Einstein and Freundlich had from the beginning not only been interested in the specific problem of the red shift, but had also intended basic research in solar physics, and the laboratories were so designed that new equipment could be installed without difficulty. The turbulent behavior of the outer solar atmosphere soon became the primary subject of research at the Einstein Tower. The red shift could be proved only in the 1950s after it became possible to precisely analyze the complex disturbances of the solar atmosphere. = Present work = The characteristics and behavior of magnetic fields provide the key to understanding solar activity and are at the focus of work at the Einstein Tower. The solar magnetic field can be measured with the help of a double spectrograph and two photoelectric polarization analyzers. Measurements in the photosphere, the visible light realm, permit conclusions about the situation at higher altitude levels. The Potsdam astronomers participate in the operation of an observatory on Tenerife. Instruments to be used there are first developed and tested at the Einstein Tower. The Einstein Tower also plays an important role in training students.  Main sights  = Einstein Sculpture = In the tower‚Äôs entrance area there is a bronze bust of Einstein which was originally located in one of the rooms of the observatory. After the Nazis' anti-Semitic dictatorship began in 1933, the Einstein Tower lost its name and status as an independent institute. Pictures of Einstein were removed and sculptures were supposedly melted down. However, after 1945 it was discovered that staff members had rescued the portrait bust now to be seen at the base of the tower by hiding it behind crates in the spectrograph lab. As a hidden homage to Einstein a single stone (German: 'ein Stein') was placed where the bust had stood, a tradition that is still kept (the stone is regularly stolen though and has to be replaced). = The 3 SEC Bronze Brain = A few meters in front of the stairs to the Einstein Tower and set into the pavement of the forecourt is a fist-sized art object, a bronze reproduction of a human brain highly reduced in size, its shiny surface a sign of wear, inscribed with the four characters, 3 SEC. It was created by the Berlin artist Volker M√§rz, who placed it here and in an identical form in front of the Neurological Institute of the Charit√© in Berlin. The small sculpture refers to a scientific thesis of Ernst P√∂ppel according to which \\"the experience of continuity is based on an illusion. Continuity arises through the networking of contents, which in each case are represented in a time window of three seconds.

Dedicated to horse racing and greyhound racing, in New Jersey it operates the 4NJBets platform on behalf of the state of New Jersey and its racing industry. History The channel was launched on July 14, 1999, and was founded by the United Video Satellite Group, the then owners of the TV Guide Network (now Pop) and TV Guide magazine (from which the \\"TVG\\" initials were partially taken). On October 5, 1999, Gemstar International Group Ltd. purchased United Video Satellite Group. In May 2006, TVG introduced several new programs to its schedule including Morning Line, Fandicapping, :58 Flat, Lady Luck (an all female panel discussion program focusing on the day's races) and Drive Time (which covered exclusive racing from the Meadowlands). TVG places microphones on select jockeys, owners, trainers, and the starting crew. The channel formerly operated a fictional betting site, TVGfree.net, which allowed it to have a presence in the fifteen states which prohibit televised and off track betting, operating similarly to poker sites which use the .net domain to differentiate their fictional betting sites from the .com sites which allow real gambling. The site was discontinued at the start of 2012 due to a site upgrade, and currently redirects to TVG.com. In the end of February 2007, TVG ended its longtime affiliation with Churchill Downs Incorporated. On May 2, 2008, Gemstar-TV Guide was acquired by Macrovision (now TiVo Corporation) for $2.8 billion. Macrovision, which purchased Gemstar-TV Guide mostly to boost the value of its lucrative VCR Plus+ and electronic program guide patents, later stated that it was considering a sale of TVG, TV Guide Network and the TV Guide print edition's namesake to other parties. In the end of 2008, Macrovision sold TVG to Betfair for $50 million in cash consideration. The deal was consummated on January 27, 2009, separating the channel from the company which acquired its founding owner in 2007. In February 2015, Betfair acquired TVG's sole competitor, HRTV, and began to consolidate it into TVG's facilities. The network was re branded as a sister network, TVG2, in October 2015. The network saw an increase in prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the shutdown of nearly all other live sports has prompted increased interest in horse racing and off-track betting from tracks that remain active; the limited tracks available have resulted in greater prominence given to smaller tracks and meets such as Nebraska's Fonner Park and the Florida Derby, and the network's personalities have made efforts to accommodate new viewers and explain the technical terminology associated with horse racing and wagers. TVG also reached an agreement with the mainstream sports channel NBCSN (which reaches at least 80 million homes, as opposed to TVG's 45 million) to simulcast a block of Trackside Live on Friday through Sunday afternoons.  Wagering services  TVG offers wagering services to residents of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey (under 4NJBets), New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming.

It is on the western third of Upolu island, with a small exclave (Satuimalufilufi village) surrounded by Aiga-i-le-Tai. It has an area of 193 km¬≤ and a population (2016 Census) of 23,265. The main centre is Leulumoega. Overview The Aana District comprises approximately 18 villages from Faleasiu in the North to Matautu in the South. The district encompasses the western portion of Upolu except for the extreme Western promontory, belonging to Aiga i le Tai district. Traditionally the northern part of the district was known as 'Itu Alofi', (Gathering side or Assembly side), as the Northern villages held a lot of the political power in historical times, whilst the Southern side was known as 'Itu Tufanua', (the backward side or the uncivilised side). It is a common occurrence in Samoa that the northern areas of both Upolu and Savaii usually held a lot of the political power especially as many of the principal villages being located in the Northern areas. Traditionally the principal village is Leulumoega, in ancient times the gathering place for the entire district. The villages are located at the coast with the exception of small inland enclaves. The coastal plain provides a lot of good land for settlement, being located near the coast for food as well as having the main Government road passing through the district. Also located within the district is Faleolo International Airport, the main airport within Samoa. The district although having no industrial business or enterprises, contains the usual family operated stores as well as one petrol station in Fasitoouta. The mountain inland is Mt Tafua Upolu, with a number of foothills at its base. The lagoon s around the entire Aana district is encompassed by the great reef that surrounds the entire island of Upolu. The soil is mostly volcanic as the past testifies, many of the old German plantation lands are located within Aana, as the soil is fertile.Lefaga coastline, 'Return to Paradise' beach, south coast Upolu 2009  History  According to legend, Tagaloa-a-lagi (Samoan's supreme god), entered Upolu, Savaii and Tonga from Manua island on the eastern tip of the Samoan archipelago.Meleisea, M. 1987b. 'Ideology in Pacific Studies: A personal view' , In: A Hooper, et al., eds., Class ad Culture in the Pacific. Centre for Pacific Studies, University of Auckland, NZ and Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific, Fiji. The political divisions of Upolu are said to be traced to his son, Pili. Pili had three sons - Tua, 'Ana (who were twins) and Saga, after whom the political divisions of Upolu are named. Tua founded the political district of ƒÄtua (literally, 'that of Tua'), which comprised the eastern third of Upolu island. 'Ana founded ƒÄ'ana ('that of Ana), a political district on the western third of the island. The third son, Saga, was born after the twins and so the district he founded was called Tuamasaga ('after the twin').So'o, Asofou (2008). Democracy and Custom in Samoa: An uneasy alliance. Suva, Fiji: IPS Publications, The University of the South Pacific. p. 2. . This was the geographical region between ƒÄ'ana and ƒÄtua districts. Since then, the three political districts of Upolu have been called ƒÄtua, ƒÄ'ana and Tuamasaga. Historically, Aana and Atua have been allies, save for a few instances when political maneuvering of ambitious chiefs and the pressures of one Tamafaiga of Manono led to a long period of tension between the two. The paramount pƒÅpƒÅ title is Tuiaana, whose residence is Nuuausala in Leulumoega, also the location of one of the main centres of Tumua. Ever since the end of the Tongan period of dominance, Aana held a lot of the political power. This began with the kidnap of the aristocratic linked infant Tamalelagi, by the orators Tutuila and Ape, (Fasitootai and Fasitoouta respectively). Tamalelagi was bestowed with the Tuiaana with assistance of the warrior goddess Nafanua and from him are descended many of the high ranking chiefs of Samoa. His daughter, Salamasina is recognised as one of Samoa's most celebrated rulers, having been the first person ever to unite the papa titles, Tuiaana, Tuiatua, Gatoaitele, Vaetamasoalii. This made her Tafaifa being the most paramount chief in Samoa especially in Upolu. Through her many of the ancient and royal lineages trace descent from her. Her residence was at Nuuausala in Leulumoega and with her royal linkage, she made Aana powerful. The prestige and power of Aana however vanished having not paying heed to Nafanua's instructions to be prepared for the day when she came to install the government at Leulumoega. Having been badly received by Leulumoega, she returned to Savaii via Manono and instead gave the government to Leiataua of Manono who therefore passed his government to his son, the famous Tamafaiga. Tamafaiga's assassination by the men of Fasitoouta initiated the Great Aana War of 1828 - 1830, which led to the complete decimation of A'ana and subjugation under the Manono-based Tamafaiga malo for many years. The war involved Aiga i le tai, the northern districts of Savaii as well as Tuamasaga as Malietoa was akin with Tamafaiga and was obliged to seek vengeance. This meant devastation for Aana, especially the Itu Alofi. This coincided with the arrival of John Williams in Sapapalii in Savaii and was a fitting end to the great ancient wars of Samoa. The many prisoners caught of Aana were burned in a great bonfire lit at Maota in Fasitootai and ended the long period of prominence A'ana had held in Samoa, until its resurgence in the late 19th century. At a national level, the district is home to one of the four Tama-a-Aiga titles in the Tuimalealiifano title based at Falelatai. Aana is divided into 5 electoral constituencies.

The district includes part of the mainland at the western end of Upolu and surrounds an exclave of A'ana district, namely Satuimalufilufi village. Historically, Manono island has been the centre of the district. In modern times, the main centre is Mulifanua where the inter-island ferry terminal is located for ocean crossings between Savai'i and Upolu. With an area of only 27 km¬≤, Aiga-i-le- Tai is the smallest electoral district in the country with a population (2016 Census) of 5,029. Va'a-o-Fonoti is the only electoral district with a smaller population. The words 'aiga i le tai literally means 'family by the sea' in the Samoan language. Chief titles Historically, the naval power of Manono and Apolima played a major role in political power-struggles between the national clans. One of the most important chiefly (matai) titles in the districts is Luatutu Aupa‚Äôau Leiataua. The district is also a major leg of the Sa Malietoa clan. Manono plays an important part in the election of the Malietoa title-holders, as Malie village also consults with Manono in the election of title holders, hence the importance of the Malietoa title in this district. Mulifanua ferry terminal Today, the ferry terminal at Mulifanua, situated on the northwest coast of Upolu, is the second-most important port on the island, after the busiest harbour in the capital Apia. The port is the main inter-island connection to Savai'i island. A regular passenger and vehicle ferry operates seven days a week, during the day, between Mulifanua and Salelologa ferry terminal on Savai'i. Views of Apolima and Manono can be seen during the crossing. Archaeology Archaeology in Samoa has uncovered pre-historic Lapita pottery sherds and adzes at Mulifanua, discovered during expansion work on the wharf in 1973. The oldest date so far from pre-historic remains at Mulifanua has been calculated by New Zealand scientists to a likely true age of circa 3,000 BP (Before Present). The submerged Lapita site was accidentally discovered in the 1970s during work to expand the inter-island ferry berth.Journal of the Polynesian Society: New Information For The Ferry Berth Site, Mulifanua, Western Samoa, By H.

His forces were subsequently squeezed in by the succeeding emperor Liu Yao and the general Shi Le, and, facing probable defeat, his followers assassinated him. He was probably ethnically Chinese, but that is not completely clear, some sources also indicate that he was of Xiongnu origin.  During Liu Cong's reign  The first reference to Jin Zhun in history was in 315, when he was mentioned as a minor Han Zhao general, whose two beautiful daughters Jin Yueguang and Jin Yuehua were taken by the Han Zhao emperor Liu Cong (Emperor Zhaowu) as consorts. Liu Cong, who was then starting the highly unorthodox practice of creating multiple empresses, creating Jin Yueguang as \\"Upper Empress\\" and Jin Yuehua as \\"Right Empress.\\" That same year, Upper Empress Jin was revealed by the official Chen Yuanda (Èô≥ÂÖÉÈÅî) as having committed adultery, causing Liu Cong to feel compelled to depose her. Ashamed, she committed suicide. It was also mentioned that another daughter of Jin Zhun married Liu Cong's son, Liu Can, but the year is unknown. As years went by, Jin Zhun became closely associated with the Liu Can and several eunuchs and servants trusted by Liu Cong and Liu Can, including Wang Chen (ÁéãÊ≤à), Xuan Huai (ÂÆ£Êá∑), and Guo Yi (ÈÉ≠Êº™). Jin and Guo were instrumental in persuading Liu Can that his uncle, Liu Ai (Âäâ‰πÇ) the crown prince was conspiring against him and his father, and subsequently participated heavily in Liu Can's plot to have his uncle falsely accused of treason and removed as crown prince in 317. Jin also assassinated the former Crown Prince Ai, on Liu Can's orders. Liu Can became crown prince, and Princess Jin became crown princess.  Coup against Liu Can  After Liu Cong died in summer 318, Liu Can succeeded to the throne, and proceeded to spend day and night committing adultery with his father's four surviving empresses -- one of which was Jin Zhun's daughter Jin Yuehua. Jin hatched a plan to overthrow Liu Can, and managed to persuade Liu Can, with the help of his two daughters (Empress Dowager Jin and Empress Jin) that several imperial princes and high-level officials were conspiring against him. With Liu Can's approval, those imperial princes and high-level officials were executed. Jin Zhun became in control of government, and, after putting his cousins Jin Ming (Èù≥Êòé) and Jin Kang (Èù≥Â∫∑) in command of the armies, carried out a coup against Liu Can, capturing and executing him. He then massacred all members of the imperial Liu clan whom he could capture -- regardless of gender or age. He also dug up the graves of Liu Cong and the founding emperor, Liu Yuan, and burned the Han Zhao imperial temple.  After the coup  Jin claimed for himself the titles of supreme commander and (historical sources are in conflict) either \\"heavenly prince\\" (Â§©Áéã)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 90.Book of Jin, vol. 102. or \\"great prince\\" (Â§ßÁéã)Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, vol. 1. of Han (the official state name for Han Zhao at the time). He acted in the role of an emperor, and he sent messengers to Emperor Yuan of Jin, claiming that he was about to revert to Jin Dynasty's rule. The Jin emperor believed him, and sent out an army to try to support him. Before that Jin army could come close to arriving, however, Jin Zhun was caught in a trap. The major Han Zhao generals Liu Yao the Prince of Qin, who controlled the Chang'an region, and Shi Le, who controlled the eastern empire, both moved their troops against him. Shi Le, whose headquarters were closer at Xiangguo (Ë•ÑÂúã, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), quickly arrived near the capital Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), but chose to not engage Jin Zhun immediately. In winter 318, Liu Yao, a cousin of Liu Cong, declared himself emperor, and advanced on Pingyang as well. Jin was caught between Liu Yao's and Shi's forces. Jin sent imperial garments and wagons to Shi, seeking peace. Shi, however, sent those, along with Jin's messenger, over to Liu Yao. Liu Yao claimed that he admired Jin for carrying out the coup that allowed him to be emperor, because the government had become so corrupt late in Liu Cong's and in Liu Can's reigns, and offered not only to spare his life but to continue to allow him to be an important official. Jin, however, distrusted Liu Yao's offer, because he had killed Liu Yao's mother and brother in the massacre. However, as he hesitated, he was assassinated by cousins Jin Ming (Èù≥Êòé) and Jin Kang (Èù≥Â∫∑), Qiao Tai (Âñ¨Ê≥∞), and Wang Teng (ÁéãÈ®∞), who then surrendered to Liu Yao, who then massacred the Jin clan.

Heavy deforestation had eliminated most of the island's forests by the first half of the 17th century, and the once common toromiro became rare and ultimately extinct in the wild in the 1950s. Sophora toromiro: flower Sophora toromiro: seed The tree is being reintroduced to the island in a scientific project partly led jointly by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Gothenburg Botanical Garden, where the only remaining plants of this species with a documented origin were propagated in the 1960s from seeds collected from a single tree by Thor Heyerdahl. It is sometimes claimed that all toromiro trees are derived from this single individual, but research has determined that at least one other tree's descendants survive (Maunder et al., 2000). Local tradition has it that the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island are made of toromiro. However, all tablets of native wood tested by modern methods have turned out to be Thespesia populnea, known as miro in some Polynesian languages. David Attenborough, in his book, Life on Air (page 236), describes the timber from which a small wooden male sculpture in his possession having been identified by Kew Gardens as Sophora toromiro.

The fono (meeting) of Atua's rulers takes place in Lufilufi on the great malae of Lalogafu'afu'a. The paramount pƒÅpƒÅ title and sovereign of ƒÄtua is the Tui ƒÄtua. The title traces its lineage to Pili, son of Tagaloa-a-lagi. One of the first known Tui Atua was Tui Atua Leutelele'i'ite of Falefa, who according to oral tradition, is said to have been part aitu (god-like) and part tagata (human-like) and lived around 1170 A.D. It is from his lifetime that the known pre-European history of Samoa associated with the Tui ƒÄtua and its holders began. The current Tui ƒÄtua is former Prime Minister, Head of State and tama-a-aiga, Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi. The two paramount matai titles of ƒÄtua are the two Tama-a-aiga titles of Tupua Tamasese and MatƒÅ'afa, respectively belonging to the two main noble lineages of ƒÄtua: SƒÅ Fenunuivao (descendants of Fenunuivao, adoptive mother of Tupua) of Falefa and Salani; and SƒÅ LevƒÅlasi (descendants of Levalasi, adoptive mother of Salamasina) of Amaile and Lotofaga.  History  According to one legend, Tagaloa-a-lagi (Samoan's supreme god), entered Upolu, Savai'i and Tonga from Manu'a island on the eastern tip of the Samoan archipelago.Meleisea, M. 1987b. 'Ideology in Pacific Studies: A personal view' , In: A Hooper, et al., eds., Class ad Culture in the Pacific. Centre for Pacific Studies, University of Auckland, NZ and Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific, Fiji. The political divisions of Upolu are said to be traced to his son, Pili. Pili had three sons - Tua, 'Ana (who were twins) and Saga, after whom the political divisions of Upolu are named. Tua founded the political district of ƒÄtua (literally, 'that of Tua'), which comprised the eastern third of Upolu island. 'Ana founded ƒÄ'ana ('that of Ana), a political district on the western third of the island. The third son, Saga, was born after the twins and so the district he founded was called Tuamasaga ('after the twin'). This was the geographical region between ƒÄ'ana and ƒÄtua districts. Since then, the three political districts of Upolu have been called ƒÄtua, ƒÄ'ana and Tuamasaga.  Geography  Located on the eastern third of Upolu, the geography of Atua comprises the mountainous interior separating the northern and southern coasts, the long sandy beaches of the southern coast from Aleipata to Poutasi, and the rocky coastline of Anoama'a in the north. Within Atua is the small itumalo of Va'a o Fonoti, a separate political district surrounded by Atua. The island of Tutuila is a traditional exclave of Atua and is its easternmost point located in what is now American Samoa.  Governance  The Tui Atua title is bestowed at Mulinu'≈´ ma Sepolata'emo, in Lufilufi, the capital of ƒÄtua by the Faleono (House of six) orator group of Lufilufi, who are vested with the authority to appoint the Tui Atua and whose authority is reflected by its title as Matua o ƒÄtua, (the elder of ƒÄtua). These six tulafale also summon the Fale Atua (what can be called the 'parliament' of ƒÄtua), to ascertain its members views on a prospective holder of their papa title when the title is vacant. This 'parliament' comprises the six tulafale of Lufilufi and 13 other matai of ƒÄtua. Of those 13 matai, nine are tulafale and four are ali'i. The members of ƒÄtua's governing parliament form an exclusive group, as only the most senior matai in ƒÄtua can sit in it. The Fale Atua ('parliament of Atua') decide with the Tui ƒÄtua in matters of war and state. The Fale Atua comprises the six orators of Lufilufi as well as the respective rulers of FalefƒÅ, Solosolo, Lalomanu, Lotofaga, Luatuanu'u. Samusu, Saoluafata, Saleaumua, and also LepƒÅ.  The Tui Atua  The line of Tui Atua extends far back into the early history of Samoa, beyond that of Queen Salamasina's reign, to the sons of Pili, descendant of the Tui Manu'a (sovereign of Manu'a). According to legend, Tagaloa-a-lagi (Samoa's supreme god), entered Upolu, Savai'i and Tonga from Manu'a island on the eastern tip of the Samoan archipelago. The political divisions of Upolu are said to be traced to his son, Pili. Pili had three sons - Tua, 'Ana (who were twins) and Saga, after whom the political divisions of Upolu are named. Tua founded the political district of ƒÄtua (literally, 'that of Tua'), which comprised the eastern third of Upolu island. 'Ana founded ƒÄ'ana ('that of Ana), a political district on the western third of the island. The third son, Saga, was born after the twins and so the district he founded was called Tuamasaga ('after the twin'). This was the geographical region between ƒÄ'ana and ƒÄtua districts. Since then, the three political districts of Upolu have been called ƒÄtua, ƒÄ'ana and Tuamasaga. Prior to the reign of Queen Salamasina, the Tui Atua was held at different times by the ranking alii of Atua, including Lufasiaitu and Mua'iteleloa of Fagaloa, Leutele of Falefa (known as Tui Atua Leuteleleiite), and the tulafale-alii polities of Fuataga and Tafua in Aleipata. From the first Tui Atua to Queen Salamasina and then from her to her descendants, the title has passed down along these lineages according to the prevalent power of the time. Since the rise of the tama-a-aiga Tupua Tamasese and later, Mata'afa in the late 1700s, the Tui Atua mantle has remained exclusively between these two, with the exception of Malietoa Vainuupo and Malietoa Moli holding it in the aftermath of multiple conflicts. = Tui Atua from Salamasina to Tupua Tamasese Efi = Tui Atua from the time of Tafa'ifƒÅ Salamasina onwards: *Tui Atua Salamasina * Tui Atua Taufau * Tui Atua Faumuina * Tui Atua Fonoti * Tui Atua Muagututi'a * Tui Atua Tupua Fuiavailili * Tui Atua Afoafouvale * Tui Atua Galumalemana * Tui Atua I'amafana *Tui Atua Safeofafine *Tui Atua Malietoa Vainu'up≈ç *Tui Atua Malietoa Molƒ´ *Tui Atua Mata'afa Fagamanu *Tui Atua Sualauvi * Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Titimaea * Tui Atua Mata'afa Lauifi * Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Lealofi-o-a'ana I * Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Lealofi- o-a'ana II * Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Lealofi-o-a'ana IV * Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi  Fa'alupega o Atua: The Charter and Salutations of Atua  = 'O le ao tetele o Atua (The Great Honours of Atua) = Tulouna 'oe Lufilufi tulouna 'oe le Tumua tulouna lo outou Faleono tulouna le afio o le Tui Atua ma Tupa'i ma Ta'inau tulouna 'Togia'i, 'o le Tui Atua ave au malaga ia te oe, Lufilufi pe a lafalafat≈´ga tulouna Leausa ne itu'au ai e alataua ai tulouna ao o Atua tulouna uso o Atua tulouna i'u o Atua tulouna le fetalaiga a Tuu'u na itu fƒÅ ai Atua tulouna le ƒÅiga SƒÅ Levalasi tulouna le ƒÅiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao tulouna a tulaniu o Atua.

The traditional centre of the district is Saleaula, where the district chiefs (matai) and orators meet at Vaituutuu malae. Like most villages in Samoa, the villages in Gagaemauga are situated by the sea although there are some settlements inland, including Patamea and Samalaeulu.

These exclaves are Le'auva'a and Salamumu villages which remain politically part of Savai'i despite their relocation. Volcanic eruptions 1900s Lava fields on Savai'i. The relocated villages of Gaga'emauga district on the main island Upolu was a result of 1905 - 1911 volcanic eruptions of Mt Matavanu, situated about 11 km inland from Matautu on the central north coast. Lava flows from eruptions destroyed villages in its path, including Saleaula and Salago villages, transforming the northern half of this district into lava fields which are still visible today, especially at Saleaula. The people of the affected areas were evacuated to Upolu, where they established the villages of Le'auva'a and Salamumu. Despite the move, they still retain their traditional links and fa'alupega (genealogy) affiliations to Gagaemauga. The names Leava'a and Salamumu denote the events of the 1905 Mt Matavanu eruption. In recent years, a few families have re-built houses on the lava fields where vegetation is still sparse.

The loop carries Interstate 73 (I-73), I-85, I-785, I-840, and U.S. Route 421 (US 421). It is primarily located within Greensboro city limits, though it crisscrosses the city line many times. The right-of-way of the Urban Loop and its interchanges between Elm-Eugene Street and Huffine Mill Road was annexed by the city of Greensboro in 2005. , of the loop is open, with under construction between Lawndale Drive and US 29\\\\. Route description The current terminus of the route is an interchange with US 29, from which the Urban Loop heads southeast as I-785/Future I-840. Turning south at an interchange with Huffine Mill Road, the road intersects US 70 shortly after. later, the Urban Loop comes to an interchange with I-40, I-85, and Business 85, at which point I-785 and Future I-840 both end and I-85 enters the Urban Loop as it heads southwest. The road winds its way southwest as I-85, intersecting Youngs Mill Road and Alamance Church Road before joining with US 421 and turning west. After meeting Elm-Eugene Street, the Urban Loop comes to an interchange complex with I-73/US 220 and Business 85/US 29/US 70\\\\. Here, I-73 joins the Urban Loop from the south as I-85 leaves it to the southwest. The two interstates officially share a wrong-way concurrency for approximately , though the collector-distributor roads of the interchanges cause the two routes to not share the same roadbed in either direction. Winding its way northwest, the Urban Loop intersects Gate City Boulevard with a diverging diamond interchange and Wendover Avenue with a partial cloverleaf interchange before reaching another interchange with I-40. US 421 leaves the Urban Loop as I-840 begins, and the road continues due north as I-73/I-840. After a single-point urban interchange with Friendly Avenue, the road curves north-northeast before coming to an interchange with Bryan Boulevard. Here, I-73 leaves the Urban Loop to the west, and the road continues as I-840, running northeast and east for . The loop intersects US 220 before terminating at Lawndale Drive. A section currently under construction runs between Lawndale Drive and US 29, intersecting North Elm Street and Yanceyville Street. History =Early development= A June 1948 document from the city Planning & Zoning Commission described the loop as part of \\"a comprehensive thoroughfare system for Greensboro.\\" At one time, the road was a parkway similar to Wendover Avenue and named Painter Boulevard, but the city did not have enough money to build it, and federal help would require a road like an Interstate Highway. It was named for Pennell Churchman Painter, the first city manager of Greensboro, serving from 1921 to 1929. Painter Boulevard appeared as a freeway loop in the 1967 City of Greensboro Transportation Plan. In June 1977, a thoroughfare plan (including what would become the Urban Loop) was adopted by the City of Greensboro, Guilford County and the North Carolina Board of Transportation. In July 1989, North Carolina Highway Trust Fund Law was enacted, which provides a trust fund for designated urban loops. By November 1989, an updated thoroughfare plan was approved by the city, county and state. Planning and environmental impact studies of the Urban Loop began in 1989-1990. In 1995, a Record of Decision was made approving the Greensboro Urban Loop; finalizing its routing and approval of an I-85 bypass. By this point, the Painter Boulevard name was no longer used. =Initial construction= In 2002, the first segment of the urban loop opened, a four- lane connector, today a part of I-785/Future I-840, between I-40/I-85 and US 70; it was unsigned and internally designated SR 3269\\\\. By 2006, Future I-840 trailblazers were added, though from I-40/I-85 it was only signed \\"To US 70.\\" On February 21, 2004, the southeast segment of the urban loop opened. On completion, I-85 was rerouted onto it, leaving its old alignment through Greensboro as Business 85. The southwest section between the present day I-73/US 220 interchange and the I-73/Bryan Boulevard interchanges opened in March 2008. I-73 was signed south of I-40, though north of I-40, I-73 and I-840 were unsigned. At the time, signs for each direction simply read \\"To I-40\\" and \\"To Bryan Boulevard.\\" =Interstate 40 relocation= The Urban Loop and its designations since January 2004 up to October 2008. Upon completion of the southwest section, I-40 was rerouted onto the southern portion of the loop, sharing the route with I-73 to the west and I-85 to the east. The existing I-40 through Greensboro was redesignated Interstate 40 Business (Business 40). On September 12, 2008, after complaints by local residents about traffic noise and motorists on the confusion between I-40 and Business 40 through Greensboro, NCDOT officials received permission from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to reroute I-40 back through the city of Greensboro and decommission Business 40. This left I-40 on its original route, while US 421 was rerouted onto the Urban Loop where it remains today. =Later construction= On July 31, 2013, NCDOT got approval from the FHWA to co-sign the eastern section of the Urban Loop (Future I-840) with I-785, establishing the new route in North Carolina, though I-785 would not be signed until the completion of the segment of the loop between US 29 and US 70\\\\. The next section to go to construction was part of the northwest section between I-73/Bryan Boulevard and US 220 (Battleground Avenue) in October 2013.https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/greensboro-urban-loop/western- loop/Pages/default.aspx Next was the northeast section from US 29 to US 70 in 2014.https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/greensboro-urban-loop/eastern- loopb/Pages/default.aspx In October 2017, ahead of the completion of the northwest section and as a new section of I-73 opened,https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/i-73-greensboro/Pages/default.aspx both I-73 and I-840 were signed on the portion of the Urban Loop between I-40 and Bryan Boulevard, marking the first time I-840 was signed as a proper route. The northeast section was completed in December 2017, signed solely as I-785, at which point the designation was also signed on the eastern section of the loop between US 70 and I-40/I-85. The northwest section opened in March 2018, extending I-840 to US 220. The next section, between US 220 and Lawndale Drive, opened on December 30, 2019. Future The last section of the Greensboro Urban Loop under construction is the segment between Lawndale Drive and US 29, featuring interchanges with North Elm Street and Yanceyville Street. Construction began in May 2018 and will be opened in two sections. The first, from Lawndale Drive to North Elm Street, is expected to open by the end of 2020, with the last segment to US 29 opening in 2021 or 2022. Upon completion of this last segment, I-840 will be posted along its entire length, including the concurrency with I-785. After the Greensboro Urban Loop is completed, NCDOT and Greensboro DOT plan to add two additional interchanges: Fleming‚ÄìLewiston Road (SR 2136), and Cone Boulevard (SR 2565). Plans for these additional interchanges have existed since 2004; however, because they are to be constructed after the loop's completion, there is no current time table or funding for these projects at this time.

They are also known as \\"megasequences\\", \\"stratigraphic sequences\\", \\"sloss sequence\\", \\"supersequence\\" or simply \\"sequences\\". Cratonic sequences are geological evidence of the sea level rising and then falling, thereby depositing layers of sediment onto an area of ancient rock called a craton. Places such as the Grand Canyon are a good visual example of this, apparent in the layers deposited over time. Cratonic sequences were first proposed by Lawrence Sloss in 1963; each one represents a time when epeiric seas deposited sediments across the craton, while the upper and lower edges of the sequence are bounded by craton-wide unconformities eroded when the seas receded. Cause and chronology These sequences may in part represent eustatic or global change in sea level; however, when the proper names are used they usually refer to the North American continent. The most likely causes of these cycles is change in mid-ocean ridge volume, which is related to spreading rates.Stanley, Steven M. Earth System History. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999. p. 174. When Earth's mid-ocean ridges spread rapidly, the ridges tend to be longer than usual; also, the greater heat elevates the lithosphere over the ridges.Stanley, p. 175 This elevated lithosphere reduces ocean-basin volume and displaces water onto the continents; conversely, when spreading rates decline, the ridges subside, and the seas drain from the cratons.Stanely, p. 175 It is also possible that other mechanisms, such as dynamic topography related to mantle mass anomalies, and intraplate stress related to episodes of contractional and extensional tectonics, play a part by causing significant tectonic uplift and subsidence across the craton.Burgess et al. 1997, Bull Geol. Soc. America There have been six cratonic sequences since the beginning of the Cambrian Period. For North America, from oldest to youngest, they are the Sauk, Tippecanoe, Kaskaskia, Absaroka, Zu√±i, and the Tejas. Attempts to identify equivalent cratonic sequences on other continents have met with only limited success, suggesting that eustasy is unlikely to be the sole responsible mechanism.

The original candy consisted of a quarter-pound mound of chopped roasted peanuts, blended with chocolate coating over a smooth cherry fondant center. It was originally called Cherry Chase, and then Cherry Chaser before becoming known as Cherry Mash. In 1944 the Chicago-based F.S. Yantis and Company purchased Chase Candy for more than $1 million. In 1954 Chase Candy acquired the Bunte Brothers Candy Company, makers of the fruit-filled hard candy known as Diana Stuft Confections. Bunte is also credited with making the first chocolate covered candy bar, the Tangos, around 1914. Today, Cherry Mash remains the Chase Candy Company's best-selling product. It is still produced in a factory in Saint Joseph, Missouri, and can be found throughout the Midwest in most grocery and convenience stores and mass-merchandise outlets.

The women's sack-back gowns and the men's coats over long waistcoats are characteristic of this period. Fashion in the years 1750‚Äì1775 in European countries and the colonial Americas was characterised by greater abundance, elaboration and intricacy in clothing designs, loved by the Rococo artistic trends of the period. The French and English styles of fashion were very different from one another. French style was defined by elaborate court dress, colourful and rich in decoration, worn by such iconic fashion figures as Marie Antoinette. After reaching their maximum size in the 1750s, hoop skirts began to reduce in size, but remained being worn with the most formal dresses, and were sometimes replaced with side-hoops, or panniers.\\"Panniers [British] (1973.65.2)\\".

For men, waistcoats and breeches of previous decades continued to be fashionable. English style was defined by simple practical garments, made of inexpensive and durable fabrics, catering to a leisurely outdoor lifestyle.Ribeiro, Aileen: The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750‚Äì1820, Yale University Press, 1995, These lifestyles were also portrayed through the differences in portraiture. The French preferred indoor scenes where they could demonstrate their affinity for luxury in dress and lifestyle. The English, on the other hand, were more \\"egalitarian\\" in tastes, thus their portraits tended to depict the sitter in outdoor scenes and pastoral attire.Ribeiro. The Art of Dress. p. 35.

Hoop skirts continued to be worn, reaching their largest size in the 1750s, and were sometimes replaced by side-hoops, also called 'false hips', or panniers. Court dress had little or no physical comfort with restriction of movement. Full size hoops skirts prevented sitting and reminded those wearing them to stand in the presence of the King. Stays forced a proper standing posture. Garments like these could not be washed often because of the fabrics from which they were made. The Enlightenment produced a backlash against sumptuary laws which asserted a stagnant social hierarchy. During the Enlightenment, court dress stayed almost the same while outside of court dress, fashion became less extravagant and shifted more towards comfort rather than courtly display.McNeil, The Appearance of Enlightenment = Gowns = The usual fashion of the years 1750‚Äì1775 was a low-necked gown (usually called a ), worn over a petticoat. Most gowns had skirts that opened in front to show the petticoat worn beneath. If the bodice of the gown was open in front, the opening was filled in with a decorative stomacher, pinned to the gown over the laces or to the stays beneath. Close-fitting sleeves just past the elbow were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and separate under-ruffles referred to as engageantes in modern terms, of lace or fine linen were tacked, to the inside of the gown's sleeves, or perhaps to the shift or chemise sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a \\"fichu\\" could be tucked into the low neckline. Women would also sometimes wear a neckerchief or a more formal lace modesty piece, particularly on low-cut dresses. The or sack-back gown featured back pleats hanging loosely from the neckline. A fitted bodice held the front of the gown closely to the figure. The or close-bodied gown featured back pleats sewn in place to fit closely to the body, and then released into the skirt which would be draped in various ways. The Brunswick dress was a two-piece costume of German origin consisting of a hip-length jacket with \\"split sleeves\\"‚Äîflounced elbow-length sleeves and long, tight lower sleeves‚Äîand a hood, worn with a matching petticoat. It was popular for traveling. Court dress, the or \\"stiff-bodied\\" gown, retained the styles of the 1670s. It featured a low, oval neckline that bared the shoulders, and the heavily boned bodice laced closed in back, unlike the front-opening robe. The elbow-length sleeves were covered with tiers of lace flounces, echoing the full-sleeved chemise worn with the original style. Front-wrapping thigh-length \\"shortgowns\\" or bedgowns of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with petticoats. Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.Baumgarten, What Clothes Reveal, pp. 116‚Äì119. As in previous periods, the traditional riding habit consisted of a tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a petticoat, and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, and later in the period a simpler riding jacket and petticoat‚Äîwithout waistcoat‚Äîcould be worn. = Underwear = The shift, chemise (in France), or smock, had a low neckline and elbow-length sleeves which were full early in the period and became increasingly narrow as the century progressed. Drawers were not worn in this period. The long- waisted, heavily boned \\"stays\\" of the early 1740s with their narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. The waist was not particularly small. Stays were laced snugly, but comfortably. They offered back support for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them. Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through \\"pocket slits\\" in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. Woollen or quilted waistcoats were worn over the stays and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of northern Europe and America. In the 1770s stays began to be produced so they would end higher on a woman's body. Phillip Vicker complained: \\"For the late importation of Stays which are said to be now most fashionable in London, are produced upwards so high that we can have scarce any view at all of the Ladies Snowy Bosoms...\\" Woman's yellow silk shoe to be worn with shoe buckle, = Shoes = Shoes had high, curved heels‚Äîthe origin of modern \\"louis heels\\"‚Äîand were made of fabric or leather, with separate shoe buckles.Tortora & Eubank 1995, p. 272. These were either shiny metal, usually in silver‚Äîsometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style‚Äîor with paste stones, although there were other types. = Hairstyles and headgear = By the 1770s extreme hairstyles and wigs had come into fashion. Women wore their hair high upon their heads, in large plumes. To create tall extreme hair, rolls of horse hair, tow, or wool were used to raise up the front of the hair. The front of the hair was then frizzed out, or arranged in roll curls and set horizontally on the head. Women turned their hair up in the back often in a knot. In addition, pomatum and false hair was used to give more height to the hair. Pomatum was paste that women used to stiffen their hair. Pomatum was also used to hold powder, which women put in their hair. The Pomatum was made of many ingredients including hog's grease, tallow, or a mix of beef marrow and oil. = Women's style gallery = File:Anna Bacherini Piattoli.jpg1 ‚Äì Image:Pompadour6.jpg2 ‚Äì 1755 Image:Pompadour .jpg3 ‚Äì 1759 File:Elisabeth Freudenreich 1760.jpg4 ‚Äì 1760 File:Lady Susan Fox-Strangways.jpg5 ‚Äì 1761 File:Denner - Queen Charlotte, 1761.jpg6 ‚Äì 1761 File:Lucretia Chandler, Mrs. John Murray, 1763, by John Singleton Copley (1738-1815) - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7698.JPG7 ‚Äì 1763 File:Mrs Benjamin Pickman by John Singleton Copley.jpeg8 ‚Äì 1763 File:John Singleton Copley Mrs. Epes Sargent II 1764.jpg9 ‚Äì 1764 File:Marie Antoinette Young4.jpg10 ‚Äì 1771 Image:Mrs John Winthrop.jpg11 ‚Äì 1773 Image:Trinquesse1.jpg12 ‚Äì 1774 # Self-portrait of Anna Bacherini Piattoli wearing a Brunswick. # A 1755 portrait of Madame de Pompadour wearing a floral gown with matching petticoat.

His breeches have buttons and buckles at the knee, 1760s. = Overview = Throughout the period, men continued to wear the coat, waistcoat and breeches of the previous period. However, changes were seen in both the fabric used as well as the cut of these garments. More attention was paid to individual pieces of the suit, and each element underwent stylistic changes. Under new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits, the elaborately embroidered silks and velvets characteristic of \\"full dress\\" or formal attire earlier in the century gradually gave way to carefully tailored woollen \\"undress\\" garments for all occasions except the most formal. This more casual style reflected the dominating image of \\"nonchalance.\\" The goal was to look as fashionable as possible with seemingly little effort. This was to be the new, predominant mindset of fashion. = Coats = The skirts of the coat narrowed from the gored styles of the previous period. Waistcoats extended to mid-thigh to the 1770s and then began to shorten. Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves. As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a banyan was worn at home as a sort of dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches. Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig. A coat with a wide collar called a frock coat, derived from a traditional working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America. = Shirt and stock = Shirt sleeves were full, gathered at the wrist and dropped shoulder. Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands. = Breeches, shoes, and stockings = Knee-length breeches fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening. Low-heeled leather shoes fastened with buckles were worn with silk or woollen stockings. Boots were worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver‚Äîsometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style‚Äîor with paste stones, although there were other types. These buckles were often quite large and one of the world's largest collections can be seen at Kenwood House. = Hairstyles and headgear = Wigs were worn for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed back from the forehead and \\"clubbed\\" (tied back at the nape of the neck) with a black ribbon. Wigs were generally now short, but long wigs continued to be popular with the older generation. Wigs were made with a lot of white powder. Wide-brimmed hats turned up on three sides called \\"cocked hats\\"‚Äîcalled tricorns in later eras‚Äîwere worn in mid-century. = The macaroni = 1773 caricature of the exaggerated style of the macaroni The trend of the macaroni grew out of the tradition of those who partook of the Grand Tour. Elite men in the 18th century would travel abroad across Europe, namely Italy, to broaden their cultural depth. These men adopted foreign fashions and tastes and brought them back to England where they interpreted them further. The original macaroni of the 1760s was characterized by elaborate dress consisting of short and tight trousers, large wigs, delicate shoes and small hats.Rauser 2004, p. 101. As the general population of English males became exposed to the luxurious appeal of the macaroni trend, they began to adopt and replicate the trends they saw. By the 1770s, any man could appear as if they themselves had been on the Grand Tour-based solely on their outward appearance. The macaroni and the subsequent imitators were criticized for being gender ambiguous and effeminate. Frequently, the macaroni fashion trend was the subject of satirical caricatures and pamphlets. Their large costume like wigs and short coats, which deeply contrasted the masculine British dress of the time, were ridiculed for their frivolity and were said to be threatening the stability of gender difference, thereby undermining the nation's reputation.Rauser 2004 The question of farce and inauthenticity comes into play as well because by dressing as a macaroni, one claimed the status and the means of an elite who went on the Grand Tour. Although many mocked the macaroni for their outwardly eccentric characteristics, some celebrated them for their commitment to the demonstration of personal identity. The idea of a unique character was becoming an important concept that spanned many types of media including books and prints as Britain wanted to distinguish itself from France.West, p. 175. = Men's style gallery = File:Man's 3-piece velvet suit c. 1755.jpg1 ‚Äì Image:Georg Friedrich H√§ndel 2.jpg2 ‚Äì 1756 File:Man's fitted banyan 1750-1760.jpg3 ‚Äì 1750‚Äì60 Image:Crowle1760s.jpg4 ‚Äì 1761 Image:Voiriot DesVoisins.jpg5 ‚Äì 1761 Image:Charles Blair (detail of The Honorable Henry Fane (1739‚Äì1802) with Inigo Jones and Charles Blair.jpg6 ‚Äì Image:Comte d'Angiviller.jpg7 ‚Äì File:1stLordWodehouse.jpg8 ‚Äì 1764 File:Nathaniel Sparhawk1 John Singleton Copley.jpeg9 ‚Äì 1764 Image:David Hume.jpg10 ‚Äì 1766 File:Benjamin West portrait of John Grey 1766.jpg11 ‚Äì 1766 File:Denis Diderot 111.PNG12 ‚Äì 1767 Image:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg13 ‚Äì 1772 # Man's 3-piece suit has coat, waistcoat and breeches of cut, uncut and voided silk velvet, France, .

Children's fashion  During most of this period, the clothes worn by middle- and upper-class children older than toddlers continued to be similar to the clothes worn by adults, with the exception that girls wore back- fastening bodices and petticoats rather than open-fronted robes. Boys wore dresses until they were breeched.

Working class clothing  Portraits of William Hogarth's servants (England, 1750s) A working-class woman wears a short dress or bedgown, a patched and mended petticoat, and neckerchief (England, ) Working-class people in 18th century England and America often wore the same garments as fashionable people‚Äîshirts, waistcoats, coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and dresses or jackets for women‚Äîbut they owned fewer clothes and what they did own was made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics. Working class men also wore short jackets, and some, especially sailors, wore trousers rather than breeches. Smock-frocks were a regional style for men, especially shepherds. Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red. Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.Styles, The Dress of the People, pp. 32‚Äì36.Baumgarten, What Clothes Reveal, pp. 106‚Äì127. Men's felt hats were worn with the brims flat rather than cocked or turned up. Men and women wore shoes with shoe buckles‚Äîwhen they could afford them. Men who worked with horses wore boots.

Awards At the Festival's closing event, the following prizes were awarded: * The People's Choice Award, presented to Gavin Hood's Tsotsi. * The Discovery Award, presented to Sarah Watt's Look Both Ways. * The Fipresci Prize, presented to South Korean director Kang Yi-kwan for Sa-kwa. * A tie for the Citytv Award for Best Canadian First Feature, presented to Louise Archambault's Familia and Michael Mabbott's The Life and Hard Times of Guy Terrifico. * The Toronto ‚Äì City Award for Best Canadian Feature Film, presented to C.R.A.Z.Y. directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e. * The Bravo!FACT Short Cuts Canada Award, presented to Renuka Jeyapalan's Big Girl (Honourable mention to Andrea Dorfman's There's a Flower in my Pedal). Because the vote for the People's Choice Award was so close, at the awards ceremony Piers Handling (festival co-director) announced four runners-up. However, in the subsequent reporting there was confusion about the order of the runners-up. As reported by ScreenDaily, the results of the People's Choice Award voting was as follows: *winner - Tsotsi (dir. Gavin Hood) *2nd place - Live and Become (dir. Radu Mihaileanu) *3rd place - Dreamer: Inspired By A True Story (dir. John Gatins) *4th place - Brokeback Mountain (dir. Ang Lee) *5th place - Mother of Mine (dir. Klaus H√§r√∂) Certain other publications indicated (probably erroneously) that the order of the runners-up was reversed, with Mother of Mine finishing second to Tsotsi.

In 1999, Harriston was amalgamated with the communities of Palmerston, Clifford, and Minto Township to form the Town of Minto. Harriston is located at the headwaters of the Maitland River, and has several shops, restaurants, a library, an art gallery and cultural centre. History In the summer of 1845, the first non-Aboriginal settlers arrived in the area. The Crown did not make land available for sale in the region until 1854. The town was named after Archibald Harrison, a Toronto farmer who was granted land along the Maitland River in Minto Township, at the Elora and Saugeen Road in 1854. Harrison's brother George Harrison built the first sawmill in 1854, and in 1856 his brother Joshua Harrison built the first gristmill, and also had the first store in the village of Harriston. The Harrisons had considerable wealth when they moved to the community from York County, and became leading men in the pioneer settlement. The population was only 150 but there were businesses including a blacksmith and wagon maker when a post office was established in 1856. Archibald Harrison was the first postmaster; he also built the first hotel, and was also the first Reeve of Minto. He gave the land for Knox Church and cemetery, also land for the first school. The southern road leading to Harriston was gravelled in 1861, opening easier access to the larger markets of Guelph, Hamilton, and Toronto. The community became a prosperous commercial and farm-implement manufacturing centre following the construction of the Wellington Grey and Bruce Railway, completed to Harriston in 1871. A telegraph link to the community followed soon thereafter. By 1872, when the village was incorporated, the population was 500. It became a Town in 1878.Judy Tuck, A History of Harriston (Mildmay, ON: Town Crier, 1978). A second rail line (the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway) intersected the village in 1873. In 1882, the Grand Trunk Railway began shipping through Harriston.http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Wellington10.html In 1874, Harriston hosted a significant political rally, attended by approximately 1,000 people. Speakers included the provincial Premier, Oliver Mowat, and R.H. Taylor, secretary of the English National Agricultural Labourers Union.Stephen Thorning, Harriston hosted huge political rally in 1874, \\"Wellington Advertiser\\" (undated). A Carnegie Library opened in Harriston in 1908, designed by architect William Edward Binning. Economic downturn and demographic changes caused significant hardship for the town during the 1970s. In September 1981, the Toronto Star featured a front page article entitled, \\"The Slow Death of a Town named Harriston.\\" The article's author, Fran Macgregor, notes, \\"Harriston used to have three grocery stores. Now there are two.\\" As of the early 2000s, there was only one grocery store. From the mid-2000s to 2014, the settlement did not have a gas station. In 1995, the Progressive Conservative government of Ontario began to reduce the number of total municipalities in the province. On January 1, 1999, the Town of Minto was created through the amalgamation of the towns of Harriston, Palmerston, the former village of Clifford, and the surrounding rural area of the former Minto Township. Civil society Beginning in the late 1860s, Harriston's citizens began to create friendly service organizations parallel to, as well as outside, of religious groups. In 1868, the Loyal Orange Institution (Orange Order) opened a Harriston Lodge (#1152). In 1871, the Ancient, Free & Accepted Masons (commonly known as Freemasons) established a Lodge (#262). Other groups followed, such as the Independent Order of Oddfellows (1879), as well as the Independent Order of Good Templars (active by 1874) and the Royal Templars of Temperance (active by 1900).Gregory Klages, \\"Freemasonic and Orange Order membership in rural Ontario during the late 19th-century: A Micro-Study \\" Ontario History CIII/2 (Fall 2011). 67-88.

Background  Downer was born in 1933 in Oklahoma, but was raised in Los Angeles, where she started her local political movements in East Los Angeles in the 1960s. She was not active in the women's movement until 1963, when she had her first abortion after separating from her first husband, who was the father of her four children. She was inspired after watching a protest on the television held at the University of California, Los Angeles, about the lack of birth control services offered on the campus. After going through her experience with the painful abortion, in the early 1970s Downer began her quest to making abortions safer for other women. She joined the LA Chapter of NOW's Abortion Committee where she met Harvey Karman. Mr. Karman was unlicensed in the medical field, and was the one responsible for educating Downer on safe abortion procedures by using suction to remove the fetus rather than scraping the uterus. Shortly after, Downer introduced menstrual extraction to other activists. Life and career Downer began her activist career in the movement for civil rights and local politics in California during the 1960s. She became active in the women's liberation movement in 1969, and she worked to try to make abortion available in Los Angeles, California under the liberalized abortion law. Downer began her work in the women's health movement on the Abortion Task Force of NOW with Lana Clarke Phelan, author of The Abortion Handbook, who became her mentor. Downer and other women observed abortion procedures at Harvey Karman's illegal abortion clinic on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles to learn how to perform abortions themselves. While there, she took a vaginal speculum and figured out how to do a vaginal self-examination. After Downer and others formed the Los Angeles Abortion Task Force, they called a meeting on April 7, 1971 at a feminist book store to educate women about abortion and their bodies. Downer demonstrated the vaginal self-examination to the estimated two dozen women who attended.Woo, Elain. (2007). ‚ÄúLorraine Rothman, 75; feminist clinic‚Äôs co founder helped demystify gynecology.‚Äù Los Angeles Times. url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/03/local/me-rothman3 Downer's group founded the Women's Abortion Referral Service, the first of its kind to offer pregnancy screening. \\"Women came from all over for help\\", Downer said. The result of this first meeting of the Self-Help Clinic was the development of the concept of menstrual extraction and the invention of the Del-Em kit by Lorraine Rothman. This provided women with a less traumatic abortion option than the use of a metal tool to scrape the inside of the uterus, which was predominately used at the time. Downer and Rothman travelled across the country and many Self-Help Clinics were formed.Davis, Flora. (1991). Moving the Mountain The Women's Movement in America since 1960, New York: Simon Schuster. p. 232-233Morgen, Sandra.(2002).\\"Into Our Hands The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1990,\\"New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press. p.34,124 During this time, abortion, birth control and fertility information were not widely available to women. The menstrual extraction and vaginal self examinations that Downer pioneered with her team provided women with the means to learn about their bodies and take control of their reproduction. Barbara Ehrenreich described Downer and Rothman's efforts as \\"legitimizing the notion that we have the right to know and decide about procedures...that affect our bodies and our lives.\\" In 1972 she also gave a notable speech to the American Psychological Association on September 5, 1972, in Hawaii, entitled \\"Covert Sex Discrimination Against Women as Medical Patients.\\" She and Rothman were leaders of a group that founded the Feminist Women's Health Center in Los Angeles in 1971. Equipped with vaginal speculums, they traveled the United States to share their information with women around the country. Downer and Rothman also promoted group meetings where they taught women how to self-administer cervical exams and provided them with information on a procedure called menstrual extraction. Downer and Rothman trained women how to suction out menstrual material on or near the time of the menstrual period; if the woman is pregnant, this constitutes a non-professional abortion.Gordon, Linda.(2002).\\"The Moral Property of Women A History of Birth Control Politics in America,\\"Chicago:University of Illinois Press.p.325Love, Barbara J.(2006).\\"Feminist Who Changed America 1963-1975,\\"Urbana and Chicago:University of Illinois Press.p.123Marieskind, Helen I.(1980).\\"Women in the Health System,\\"St.Louis, Missouri:The C.V.

In 1972, the police conducted a search of Downer's clinic/health center and arrested her and Colleen Wilson for practicing medicine without a proper license. Called the Great Yogurt Conspiracy, they were using yogurt inter-vaginally to treat a woman's yeast infection.Morgen, Sandra.(2002).\\"Into Our Hands The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1990,\\"New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press. p. 130Ruzek, Sheryl Burt.(1978).\\"The Women's Health Movement Feminist Alternatives to Medical Control,\\"New York:Praeger Publishers.p.144 Downer was later acquitted of all charges. Within 50 days of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, which ruled that women have a right to end their pregnancy, her group opened the Women's Choice Clinic in Los Angeles and Orange County. Over the next two years, other Feminist Women's Health Centers were established, forming part of the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Center in 1975. From 1987 to 1991, Downer attended law school and worked for the Federation of FWHCs. Since then, she has practiced law, mostly in the area of disability rights. In 1981, she was the general editor of A New View of a Woman's Body, published by Simon and Schuster, and she was an editor of a companion book, How to Stay Out of the Gynecologist's Office, published by Women to Women Publication. In 1984, she and Francie Hornstein assisted Ginny Casside-Brinn, a Registered Nurse, in writing Woman-Centered Pregnancy and Birth, published by Cleis Press. But during the Reagan Administration, the anti-abortion movement grew, and the clinics were hit with protests. \\"The low point was 1985, when the clinic burned down, but we didn‚Äôt give up,\\" Downer said. Many believe the fire was started by protesters. So these women began mobile clinics located in vans, which did screenings in a safe and secure location. In 1992, she wrote A Woman's Book of Choices with Rebecca Chalker, published by Seven Stories Press. She has also served on the Board of Directors of the National Abortion Federation. Downer's book included instructions on how to practice early abortions more safely. The procedure requires the assistance of at least two experts. The book does not only tell readers to do abortions on their own, but it gives advice about when a woman should go to a medical practitioner to terminate early pregnancy. Downer is currently promoting women's liberation, giving speaking presentations, and working on her next book in which she advances the belief that women's collective efforts to achieve their sexual and reproductive liberation is a fundamental strategy for social change. She is also working on the board of directors of the Feminist Women's Health Centers of California. This board operates eight Women's Health Specialist Clinics. She recently posted a video on YouTube about the history of her foundation and how she taught other women about the speculum abortion technique.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqcGfxsLokY She is also an immigration lawyer in the Los Angeles area.  Awards  Throughout Carol Downer's career, she has received multiple awards, such as: ¬∑ Outstanding Women Edition of Life Magazine in 1976. ¬∑ Women's Caucus of American Health Association in 1989 ¬∑ Wiley W.

Due to strong competition from Los Angeles stations KOST and KBIG, KQLH was unable to succeed as an adult contemporary station. On December 25, 1989, KQLH flipped to a country format. The call letters were then changed to KFRG. On August 17, 2006, KFRG became the only country radio station that could be heard in the Los Angeles area by default, as KZLA changed its programming format to rhythmic adult contemporary, until December 1, 2006 when KKGO changed its programming format from adult standards to country to fill a void in the Los Angeles area. As a result of the void left by KZLA, KFRG briefly began showing up in the Los Angeles ratings. KFRG has focused more on Orange County and Los Angeles area news and traffic since the demise of KZLA, but on February 23, 2007, KKGO moved its Country format and call letters to its FM sister station, thus bringing a full-powered FM Country music station back to the nation's second largest radio market after a six-month absence.

The first woman elected to the House of Commons of Canada was Agnes Macphail, in the 1921 election. Although female representation in politics has increased since then, and political parties have identified increasing the number of female candidates as an organizational and political goal, women are still significantly underrepresented in politics compared to the general population. Canada has had one woman Prime Minister, Kim Campbell. Political parties have occasionally achieved balanced representation in their elected caucuses, but mainly as a byproduct of a party collapse ‚Äì for example, in the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservatives achieved gender parity in their elected caucus, but only by virtue of electing just two Members of Parliament nationwide and losing official party status. At various times, parties have also had 100 per cent female representation in their caucuses, but again only by virtue of having a caucus that consisted of just one or two members. The Yukon New Democratic Party attained the distinction, in the 2011 Yukon general election, of becoming the first party with official party status ever to have an elected caucus that reached or exceeded parity between women and men, with four women and two men elected as MLAs. The Alberta New Democratic Party attained the distinction, in the 2015 Alberta general election, of coming the closest that a governing party caucus has ever come to attaining gender balance ‚Äî the party's caucus had 25 women and 28 men, representing a caucus that was 47 per cent female.\\"Young MLAs, many of them female, will soon rule in Alberta\\". Toronto Star, May 9, 2015. The non-partisan consensus government of the Northwest Territories achieved near gender parity across the entire legislature in the 2019 Northwest Territories general election, with nine women and 10 men elected as MLAs; at the first formal meeting of the legislative assembly, the MLAs selected a woman, Caroline Cochrane, as premier, and chose women for four of the six cabinet roles.Ollie Williams, \\"Here's who will be in Caroline Cochrane's NWT cabinet\\". Cabin Radio, October 24, 2019. As of 2010, Canada ranked 50th in the world for women's participation in politics, with women holding just 23 per cent of the seats in federal, provincial and territorial legislatures.\\"Canada 50th in participation by women in politics\\". Toronto Star, March 8, 2010. At the federal level, Canada was tied with Mauritania for 49th place.\\"Women in national parliaments\\". Inter-parliamentary Union, February 28, 2010. Women as federal representatives In the 1921 election Agnes Macphail became the first woman elected to the Canadian House of Commons. Four other women ‚Äì Harriet Dick, Rose Mary Henderson, Elizabeth Bethune Kiely and Harriet Dunlop Prenter ‚Äì also stood as candidates in the same election, although they were not successful. Macphail was reelected in every subsequent election until 1940. She was the only woman in the House of Commons until 1935, when she was joined by Martha Black. In the 1940 election, Macphail was defeated and Black did not stand as a candidate, but Dorise Nielsen was elected, and Cora Taylor Casselman was elected in a 1941 by-election to succeed her late husband. On March 13, 1944, Casselman became the first woman ever to preside over the House of Commons as acting Speaker, on an occasion when speaker James Allison Glen had to briefly step away from the chair and deputy speaker Joseph-Arthur Bradette was unavailable. Nielsen and Casselman were both defeated in 1945, but Gladys Strum was elected that year. Strum, in turn, was defeated in 1949, the only election after 1921 in which no female candidates were elected to Parliament at all. However, Ellen Fairclough was elected to the House in a by-election the following year. In the subsequent 1953 election, four women ‚Äì Fairclough, Margaret Aitken, Sybil Bennett and Ann Shipley ‚Äì were elected to Parliament. Every subsequent election has had at least two women elected to Parliament, except 1968 when Grace MacInnis was the only woman elected. Shipley became, in 1955, the first woman in Canadian history to introduce the formal motion to accept a Speech from the Throne. Fairclough became, in 1957, the first woman appointed to the Cabinet of Canada; she was also named as Acting Prime Minister for two days in 1958 while John Diefenbaker was out of the country on a state visit, the first woman ever to be given that duty. The number of women elected to the House reached double digits for the first time in the 1979 election, when 10 women were elected. In 1980, Jeanne Sauv√© was appointed the first female Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. Federally, the 2015 election holds the record for the most female candidates in a single election, with 533 women running for office that year.\\"Women Candidates in General Elections - 1921 to Date\\". Parliament of Canada. Prior to 2015, the record had been held by the 1993 election, an election which was unusual for a record number of smaller upstart parties running alongside the established ones ‚Äî of the 476 female candidates that year, 76 of them ran for parties which had entirely ceased to exist by the time of the subsequent 1997 election, in which the number of female candidates retreated to 408. In terms of women elected to the House of Commons, the 2015 election also holds the record, with 88 successful female candidates. As of 2017, 319 women overall have served in the House of Commons. Of the major federal political parties, the New Democratic Party has nominated the most female candidates in every election since its creation, except in the 1962 election, when it tied with the Progressive Conservatives, and the 2008 election, when the Liberals nominated the most female candidates for the first time in their history. The Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada nominated more women than the New Democrats in 1979 and 1980, although they are a minor party who have never won a seat in the House of Commons. Between the 1935 and 1958 elections, the top ranking was consistently held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or the Labor- Progressive Party. The New Democratic Party caucuses in the 39th Canadian Parliament, the 41st Canadian Parliament and the 42nd Canadian Parliament were all 40 per cent female, the closest that a party with official party status has ever come to attaining full gender balance. The party's slate of candidates in the 2015 election was also 42 per cent female, with 145 women constituting the largest slate of female candidates ever nominated by a single political party in a federal election. =Leadership= Kathryn Cholette of the Green Party was the first woman ever to win the leadership of a federal political party, and Audrey McLaughlin of the New Democratic Party was the first woman to win the leadership of a party with seats in the House of Commons. Canada has had one woman Prime Minister, Kim Campbell. She became Prime Minister before the 1993 federal election by winning the leadership of the governing Progressive Conservatives, but lost the subsequent general election. No woman has yet been elected Prime Minister of Canada in a general election. Two women, Sheila Copps and Anne McLellan, have served as Deputy Prime Minister, although this is largely a ceremonial post with very little actual power. Several women, including Mary Walker-Sawka, Rosemary Brown and Flora MacDonald, had previously run for the leadership of federal political parties. Brown was the first black woman to ever run for leadership of a federal political party. MacDonald unwittingly lent her name to a political phenomenon known as \\"Flora Syndrome\\" when even some of her own committed delegates at the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election failed to vote for her, a loss of support which many commentators attributed to sexism. Three women -- Deborah Grey, Nycole Turmel, and Rona Ambrose‚Äîhave served as Leader of the Opposition. All of the women served as interim leaders of their parties during leadership campaigns; however, Grey was considered only an acting Leader of the Opposition. Three other women have served as leaders of political parties in the House of Commons: Alexa McDonough, who succeeded McLaughlin as leader of the New Democratic Party in 1995; Elsie Wayne, who served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservatives in 1998; and Elizabeth May, who entered the House of Commons in the 2011 election as the leader and first elected MP of the Green Party. Two smaller political parties which currently do not hold any seats in the House of Commons are also led by women: * Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) ‚Äì Anna Di Carlo * Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada ‚Äì Liz White This dearth of women in political leadership may, in some ways, be attributable to women's general exclusion from important cabinet positions that are seen as stepping stones to leadership. Women were largely excluded from Canadian cabinets until the 1970s. Only in rare instances do women comprise a significant proportion of Canadian cabinets, as in the case of then-Ontario Premier Bob Rae's first cabinet in 1990, in which 11 of 26 ministers were women. As of July 2013, the Harper Cabinet had 11 female ministers in a cabinet of 39, though most held minor portfolios; in October 2015, Justin Trudeau became the first prime minister to appoint a fully gender-balanced cabinet with equal numbers of both men and women. =Senate= The first woman appointed to serve in the Senate of Canada was Cairine Wilson, in 1930. Three women ‚Äì Joyce Fairbairn, Sharon Carstairs and Marjory LeBreton ‚Äì have served as Leader of the Government in the Senate. One woman, C√©line Hervieux-Payette, has held the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. One woman, Muriel McQueen Fergusson, has served as Speaker of the Senate, a position she occupied from 1972 to 1974. The Famous Five, a group of five women whose activism originally secured the right of women to be named to the Senate, were posthumously named as honorary senators in 2009. The women ‚Äì Emily Murphy, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby and Louise McKinney ‚Äì are the only people in the history of the Senate to be given this honour. Women as provincial/territorial premiers To date, thirteen women have served or are currently serving as the premier of a province or territory in Canada. The first female premier in Canadian history was Rita Johnston, who served as Premier of British Columbia for seven months in 1991 after she won the leadership of the governing Social Credit Party, but the party was defeated in the subsequent general election. The first woman to become premier by winning a general election was Catherine Callbeck in Prince Edward Island in 1993. To date, the most common path for a woman to becoming premier or prime minister has been to win the leadership of the party that was already in power, thus immediately becoming the first minister without a general election. Women who attained a leadership position in this manner have, however, had a mixed record of success or failure in their first general elections as leader; Campbell and Johnston both failed to win reelection, while several other women (including Callbeck) succeeded. Only three women ‚Äî Pat Duncan in Yukon, Pauline Marois in Quebec, and Rachel Notley in Alberta ‚Äî have become premier of a province or territory by leading their party to victory in a general election in which they were not already the incumbent premier: Duncan was elected in 2000, Marois in 2012, and Notley in 2015. No woman premier has ever won two successive general elections, however; to date, every woman premier who has won one election has either lost, or resigned the office in advance of, her second election at the helm.Chantal H√©bert, \\"Why do Canada‚Äôs women premiers seem to only get one term in office?\\". Toronto Star, June 6, 2018. Women achieved a significant breakthrough in the early 2010s, when a number of women won the leadership of the governing political parties in their respective provinces within a short time of each other. Several journalists christened 2011 as \\"The Year of the Woman\\" because of the breakthrough;\\"The Year of the Woman (in provincial politics, anyway)\\". CBC News, October 15, 2011. by September 2012, in fact, fully half of all Canadian provinces had female premiers. By early 2014, however, two of the premiers had resigned amid controversy, which some analysts attributed in part to gender issues. According to political scientist Brenda O'Neill of the University of Calgary, \\"I think there still is a double standard that's applied to women versus men in terms of how they lead, the degree of support they are given and the degree to which is extended to them when they make mistakes.\\"\\"Did sexism play a role in Alison Redford‚Äôs downfall?\\". Global News, March 20, 2014. Nellie Cournoyea and Caroline Cochrane in the Northwest Territories, and Eva Aariak in Nunavut, have served as territorial premiers through a non-partisan consensus government system in which they were selected by their colleagues in the legislative assembly rather than by leading a political party to victory. To date, six of Canada's ten provinces have had a female premier, but only British Columbia and Alberta have had more than one. All three of Canada's territories have had at least one female premier each. The only current female premier is Caroline Cochrane, who was selected as Premier of the Northwest Territories on October 24, 2019.John Last and Sidney Cohen, \\"Caroline Cochrane elected premier of the N.W.T.\\". CBC North, October 24, 2019. Upon winning the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election, Wynne also earned the distinction of being the first out lesbian to hold a first ministership in Canada. Women as provincial and territorial representatives At the provincial level, the first woman elected to a provincial legislature was Louise McKinney, who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1917. Another woman, Roberta MacAdams, was elected in the same election ‚Äì however, McKinney was elected to a conventional electoral district, while MacAdams was elected to a special temporary district allotted to soldiers in combat during World War I, and thus McKinney's victory was certified first. The first woman to serve as a provincial cabinet minister was Mary Ellen Smith, who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1918 and was appointed to the cabinet in 1921. McKinney and Smith were also the first women in the entire British Empire to hold those distinctions, and MacAdams became the first woman in both Canada and the British Empire to introduce a piece of legislation for debate.Debbie Marshall. Give Your Other Vote to the Sister: A Woman's Journey into the Great War, University of Calgary Press, 2007. Nancy Hodges became the first woman in both Canada and the Commonwealth of Nations to be elected as the Speaker of a legislature ‚Äî although Smith had also previously served a short stint as Acting Speaker, and was similarly the first woman in both Canada and the British Empire to do so. Hilda Watson, who became the first leader of the newly formed Progressive Conservative Party in the Yukon, led her party to victory in the 1978 territorial election, the territory's first partisan legislative election ‚Äì however, she was defeated in her own riding by another woman, Alice McGuire, and therefore did not become government leader. Five women are currently serving as leaders of political parties which hold legislative seats at the provincial level: * Alison Coffin (Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party), * Elizabeth Hanson (Yukon New Democratic Party), * Andrea Horwath (Ontario New Democratic Party), * Manon Mass√© (Qu√©bec solidaire), * Rachel Notley (Alberta New Democratic Party). Notley and Horwath are currently the leader of the Official Opposition in their provinces; Hanson and Coffin lead third parties; Mass√© is co-leader of a fourth party. Five women are currently serving as Deputy Premiers: Genevi√®ve Guilbault in Quebec, Karen Casey in Nova Scotia, Carole James in British Columbia, Christine Elliott in Ontario and Heather Stefanson in Manitoba. Because all legislators in the consensus government system of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are elected as independent MLAs rather than as candidates of political parties, both of the territories historically often had the smallest percentages of female members of any legislature in Canada;\\"A Few Good Women: The Gender Problem in NWT Politics\\". Edge YK, December 4, 2015. however, both territories made significant breakthroughs for women's representation in their most recent legislative elections. In the 2017 Nunavut general election six women were elected,\\"Close race in western Nunavut hub triggers recount\\". Nunatsiaq News, October 31, 2017. vaulting the territory to 27 per cent female representation in the legislature and marking the first time in the territory's history that it ranked higher than last or second-last for female representation among Canada's provinces and territories. In the Northwest Territories, a woman was not elected to any district outside of Yellowknife and Hay River, the two largest and most urbanized communities in the territory, in any election between 1995 and 2019. In the 2019 Northwest Territories general election, however, the territory went from just two female MLAs before the election, ranking dead last in all of Canada for female representation in the legislature, to electing nine women, reaching virtual gender parity in the 19-seat legislature and immediately vaulting to the highest percentage of female representation in all of Canada.Emelie Peacock, \\"Push to get women into territorial politics a success\\". Cabin Radio, October 1, 2019. Canada's other Arctic territory of Yukon, conversely, is governed under a political party structure and thus has had much greater success in electing women to the Yukon Legislative Assembly, with the territory regularly ranking well ahead of even some Canadian provinces for female representation in the legislature. Personal aspects As in the United States, many of Canada's earliest women to hold political office attained their positions through the practice of widow's succession, in which they were appointed or elected primarily as a caretaker to political offices that had been held by their deceased husbands. This practice became less common as the number of women in politics, and their resulting prominence and power, increased over the course of the 20th century. In 1985, Pauline Marois became the first woman in Canadian history to give birth to a child while serving as a provincial cabinet minister. She was followed in 2001 by British Columbia Member of the Legislative Assembly Christy Clark.\\"Christy Clark and the Woman Politician Thing\\". The Tyee, December 9, 2010. In 1987, Sheila Copps became the first woman in Canadian history to give birth to a child while sitting as a federal Member of Parliament. In 1999, Michelle Dockrill became the first Member of Parliament to bring her newborn baby into the House of Commons. Women in politics still sometimes face a double standard, with their personal lives subject to greater scrutiny than those of men in equivalent positions. In what some commentators have characterized as an example of sexism, Clark was asked by several journalists to explain how she could properly do her job as provincial Minister of Education while simultaneously raising a newborn child; her then- husband, Liberal Party strategist Mark Marissen, was not asked the same question despite holding a similarly busy and high-profile public position. When Clark announced her candidacy for the 2011 British Columbia Liberal Party leadership race, she was again asked by journalist Bill Good how she planned to balance her role as a mother with the responsibilities of serving as provincial premier if she won ‚Äì to which Clark answered, Similarly, following Clark's victory in the leadership race, Global Vancouver anchor Chris Gailus was criticized for asking her in an interview whether her new job as premier would leave her any time to date.\\"Premier or not, Clark sets the boundaries for her personal life\\" . Vancouver Sun, March 2, 2011. While sitting as a provincial MLA in Manitoba, Judy Wasylycia-Leis gave birth to a child in 1988, and was dismissed by another MLA as \\"a high-priced babysitter\\" when she set up a playpen in her office and took time out from a committee meeting to breastfeed.Kaj Hasselriis, \\"A Woman's Place is in the House of Commons\\". Herizons, Winter 2009. Both Copps and Campbell wrote in their autobiographies that their romantic and family lives were excessively scrutinized by colleagues and journalists. In the 2006 book The Secret Mulroney Tapes, Brian Mulroney ‚Äì Campbell's immediate predecessor as Prime Minister ‚Äì asserted that Campbell's romantic relationship with Gregory Lekhtman distracted her from conducting a proper campaign in the 1993 election. He did not, however, elaborate on how Campbell's personal life constituted a greater distraction to her political career than his own family life with his wife Mila and their four children did to his. Similarly, when Belinda Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals in 2005, political reaction to her announcement took on a very different tone than similar moves by male politicians ‚Äì while David Emerson, for instance, was criticized in a relatively civil manner for the ethics of his floor-crossing, Stronach was variously labelled a \\"dog\\", a \\"dipstick\\" and a \\"whore\\" by her former colleagues. In her autobiography Time and Chance, Kim Campbell claimed that her own campaign staff sometimes treated her more as a figurehead than as the actual leader of the party, even going so far as to keep campaign offices at Brian Mulroney's preferred room temperature even if Campbell ordered them to adjust the thermostat.Maclean's =Beauty and aesthetic critique= Criticism of female politicians in Canada has often occurred in terms of aesthetic assessment that has worked to connect ideas about a politician's beauty to their political and leadership abilities. Clothing, hairstyles and overall appearance have all been subject to scrutiny. For example, Conservative MP Rona Ambrose received extraordinary publicity that focused on her beauty rather than any element of her capacity to represent her constituency or work as an MP. Also, former NDP leader Alexa McDonough was sometimes judged for wearing the same dress on multiple occasions, with magazines featuring headlines such as \\"Alexa McDonough, Call your dry-cleaner.\\" Belinda Stronach's run against Stephen Harper for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2004 was labeled \\"Blond Ambition\\"; Stronach later attracted more press for dyeing her hair brown and dating Tie Domi than for her actual accomplishments in politics or business. Political aspects Unlike the offices of state governor or president in the United States, prime ministers and provincial premiers in Canada are not independently elected by the general electorate; instead, the position goes automatically to the leader of the largest party caucus in the legislature. This creates a significantly different campaign dynamic, which may unintentionally complicate the efforts of women to achieve higher office. For instance, while it is possible in the United States for voters to choose one party's candidate for president or governor and a different party's candidate for their congressional or state representative, Canadians vote only for their local representative, and not directly for their premier or prime minister. In the 1990s, parties led by women often fared particularly poorly in election campaigns, sometimes even losing elections their parties had seemed poised to win. This gave rise to extensive discussion of the double standards that the public applies to women in leadership roles; some commentators have noted, for instance, that when a party led by a woman loses an election, much greater blame is placed on the leader herself ‚Äî or even on the entire concept of women as leaders ‚Äî than when a man leads his party to defeat. Prior to the 21st century only one woman, Catherine Callbeck in Prince Edward Island, had ever won election to a first ministership in Canada ‚Äî notably, she led her party into an election where the main opposition party was also led by a woman, Patricia Mella, and thus a woman would have been elected premier of Prince Edward Island in 1993 regardless of which party won. Political analysts have debated, however, whether either woman could have won the election if the other party had been led by a man. Further, Callbeck's government proved unpopular, and she held power for just three years before she was forced to step down in favour of a new leader. However, as the number of women leaders has increased, several other women leaders have since led their parties to election victories. Campbell's Progressive Conservatives and McLaughlin's New Democratic Party were decimated in 1993, both failing to reach official party status, and Lyn McLeod's Ontario Liberal Party lost the 1995 provincial election despite having more than a 10 per cent lead in the polls when the election was called. McLeod was criticized for a perceived tendency toward weak leadership and flip-flopping on the issues, especially after she withdrew her party's support from the 1994 Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act ‚Äì PC election ads depicted McLeod as a weathervane shifting in the wind, and the party's popular support dropped almost 20 percentage points in the space of just 40 days. Alexa McDonough led the New Democrats to a modest resurgence in the 1997 election, but lost seats again in the 2000 vote. Several women leaders of provincial parties, including Sharon Carstairs, Lynda Haverstock and Nancy MacBeth, proved unable to capitalize on early signs of popularity, all ultimately losing significant ground for their parties. Pat Duncan, meanwhile, won the 2000 Yukon election against parties led by men, but her government lasted just two years before it was reduced to a minority when three Liberal MLAs resigned from the caucus ‚Äì and in the resulting 2002 election, her party was nearly wiped out. Some have attributed this to the belief that the voting public widely ascribes leadership qualities more to men than to women. Sheila Copps, for example, once noted in a newspaper interview that \\"if you're a woman and you're aggressive, you're a ball-buster\\", Ruby Dhalla told an interviewer from Inter Press Service that women in politics have to be tougher, stronger and harder-working than men to reach the same level of achievement,\\"Women leaders have to be tougher and stronger than men\\". Human Rights Tribune, March 6, 2009. and Charlotte Whitton, one of Canada's first prominent women mayors, once famously quipped that \\"Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.\\"Susan Delacourt, \\"For female politicians, equality is hard work\\". Toronto Star, February 4, 2011. Andrea Horwath, the current leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party, has noted that she faced not just indifference, but active discouragement, from both men and women ‚Äì based around the notion that at age 35, she was too young and hadn't earned the right to get into politics ‚Äì when she first ran for Hamilton, Ontario City Council in 1997: Conversely, however, MP Martha Hall Findlay has asserted that one of the biggest barriers to women's greater participation in politics is their own fear of stepping into the public spotlight: Maureen MacDonald, a New Democratic MLA in Nova Scotia, has offered a similar assessment: Danielle Smith, the former leader of the Wildrose Alliance in Alberta, has also suggested that new opportunities have been opened for women due to recent changes in Canadian political culture. According to Smith, the fact that most governments in Canada have now instituted fixed election dates helps women, who still generally hold more responsibility for the care of children and aging or ailing parents than most men do, to plan more easily toward a goal of running for political office; and the fact that most political parties have now moved to a one member one vote system, instead of the more traditional leadership convention method of selecting leaders, has helped women because the grassroots are typically more willing to vote for women leaders than the \\"old boys network\\" inside a political party's establishment are. Conversely, commentators have also claimed that political parties in Canada have tended to turn to female leaders as an almost cynical ploy in times of crisis ‚Äì in some cases, parties have been accused of relying on the \\"novelty\\" of a female leader as almost a substitute for creating a substantive policy platform. Campbell and Johnston, for instance, both inherited the leadership of scandal- plagued and unpopular incumbent parties which were considered unlikely to win the next election even before each woman assumed the party's leadership. Due to the timing of the leadership campaigns, further, both became leader late in the final year of the government's mandate, just weeks before a mandatory election. As a result, both were left with very little time to demonstrate that their administrations could offer any sort of fundamental change, and thus remained vulnerable to the negative perceptions that voters held of their predecessors. Meanwhile, women such as Pam Barrett, Joy MacPhail, Lynda Haverstock, Alexa McDonough, Sharon Carstairs, Elizabeth Weir, Karen Casey, Shirley McLoughlin and Carole James became leaders of provincial parties which had already been largely wiped off the electoral map. According to political scientist Linda Trimble, this made the leadership of these parties a \\"flawed prize\\" which a male politician would be seen as weak for even wanting ‚Äì and then those women who actually achieved a measure of success in reviving the parties often became vulnerable to internal leadership challenges once their work had returned the party to real contention for power, and renewed desirability as a prize for male politicians to pursue. Carole James had the most dramatic success of any woman leader in reviving a party in crisis, taking the British Columbia NDP from its dramatic defeat in the 2001 election ‚Äì when it won just two seats and didn't even qualify for official party status ‚Äì to 33 seats in the 2005 election. However, some critics dismissed her as being competent enough to bring the party's traditional core vote back following an unprecedented disaster, but not possessing the leadership skills necessary to take the party any further than its own base; in the subsequent 2009 election, the party won just two additional seats.\\"What Now? After bringing the NDP far in 2005, this time Carole James couldn't seal the deal\\". The Tyee, May 13, 2009. After a period of caucus infighting, she was forced to announce her resignation as party leader in December 2010; notably, her (male) successor, Adrian Dix, led the party to a slightly worse result in the 2013 election than James had in 2009. Political scientist Sylvia Bashevkin has noted the disparity between how male and female politicians are perceived by the public. In her book Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy, she explains that female politicians are far less likely to receive media coverage than their male counterparts. Moreover, in the cases where women manage to attract coverage, the media often tends to \\"[focus] on personal style and private life matters, rather than on public policy views.\\" Here, the 2004 Conservative leadership election may serve as a case-study: as Bashevkin observes, the media mentioned Belinda Stronach's marital status \\"four times as often as they did that of fellow contender Stephen Harper.\\" Furthermore, many desirable leadership qualities are commonly associated with masculinity. As a result, a female politician who displays these qualities may be seen as off-putting and unfeminine. Kim Campbell, for instance, has commented on the uneasy relationship between leadership and gender: \\"I was called arrogant, aggressive and lacking compassion,\\" she stated in 1997, \\"I don't have a typically female pattern of speech. I'm open and assertive. In men, those traits are perceived as leadership material. In a woman, they are denigrated\\". Similarly, Sheila Copps and Sharon Carstairs have been accused of harshness and stridence, with Copps receiving the epithets of \\"baby\\", \\"slut\\" and \\"bitch\\" in Parliamentary discourse. Encouraging women's participation Because male and female politicians are judged according to disparate standards, Bashevkin has suggested that many women may be discouraged from entering politics in the first place. She writes, \\"[E]fforts to recruit more female candidates often fall short once the individuals being wooed start to think about what happened to the few courageous pioneers who preceded them.\\" This might explain the general decrease of female representation in Canadian government in recent years‚Äîfor instance, a major federal party has not had a female leader since Alexa McDonough resigned her post as head of the NDP in 2003. Political parties at both the federal and provincial levels have often faced difficulty in boosting the number of women prepared to stand as election candidates. This may be in part because women may be reluctant to run for parliament because of the adversity and combative nature of work. Political parties which take a strictly hands-off approach typically find themselves unable to put forward a slate of candidates that is more than 20 to 25 per cent female ‚Äì but parties which implement more active strategies often risk being criticized as \\"anti-democratic\\" if their programs too closely resemble affirmative action. For example, the British Columbia New Democratic Party has used a strategy in which a riding association whose incumbent MLA retires must nominate a woman in the resulting by-election or general election, in order to ensure that the party is placing women in \\"winnable\\" seats ‚Äì however, this strategy faced criticism from some potential candidates who felt that the policy constituted reverse discrimination against them as men.\\"B.C. NDP to choose candidates through affirmative action\\" . Vancouver Sun, November 18, 2007. Conversely, the federal New Democratic Party requires its riding associations to make at least a good faith attempt to ensure that women or minority candidates are on the ballot whenever a nomination contest is held, but does not set a quota per se. At various times, both federal and provincial parties have also been accused of tokenism, slotting a disproportionate number of women candidates in ridings their party has little chance of winning while doing little or nothing about the fact that the more competitive candidate selection process in \\"winnable\\" seats still tends to favor men.. In addition to the underrepresentation of women in politics overall, younger women are typically even more underrepresented. While younger men are quite regularly elected to political office at all levels of government, women under the age of 40 holding office at the provincial or federal levels are especially rare.\\"Parliament gets a makeover: An influx of young women could help change Canadian politics for good\\". Ottawa Citizen, May 6, 2011. This dichotomy has been attributed to a variety of factors, including women being reluctant to take on the responsibilities of a career in politics until their children are older, as well as the belief that younger women are especially likely to face sexist assumptions that their political and professional abilities are unequal to those of men in the same age bracket. The non-partisan organization Equal Voice, whose board consists of several prominent female politicians, works to assist women in running for public office through education, advocacy and professional networking. When former federal MP Belinda Stronach was given an award by Equal Voice for her role in advancing women's participation in politics, in her speech she identified some of what she saw as the barriers, including a lack of civility in the House of Commons, an excessive focus on women parliamentarians' appearance rather than their ideas and skills, and the need to take advantage of modern communications technologies, such as videoconferencing and Internet voting, so that both men and women in politics have greater flexibility to balance their job duties with their family lives.\\"Belinda Stronach‚Äôs prescription for getting women into politics\\". The Globe and Mail, November 9, 2010. Prior to the 2015 Northwest Territories general election, the territorial Status of Women Council ran an educational seminar on women in politics, which was attended by all ten women who ran as candidates in the election campaign. Given the consensus government structure of the legislature, one of the strategies that the women pursued was to not run against each other, in an attempt to avoid splitting the vote; of the 19 legislative districts in the territory, only one had more than one woman candidate on the ballot. In 2015, MP Christine Moore gave birth to her first child during the federal election campaign.\\"NDP MP Moore, who gave birth during campaign, wants MPs to ‚Äòaim higher‚Äô on work-life balance\\". The Hill Times, December 21, 2015. In her first statement to the 42nd Canadian Parliament, she spoke of the need for parliamentarians to make the political environment more family friendly, stating that \\"I hope we can make the world a place where women and new parents do not have to choose between their careers and their families...It is important for society to make it easier, not harder, to achieve work-life balance.\\" Municipal politics Hannah Gale was elected to Calgary City Council in 1917, becoming the first woman ever elected to any municipal office in Canada. However, women had previously served as school trustees. In 1920, Violet Barss became the first woman ever appointed as a reeve in Canada, in the village of Delia, Alberta. (Reeve is a position similar to mayor, with the difference that Barss was selected and appointed internally by her colleagues on the village council, not directly elected to the position by the voters.) In 1936, Barbara Hanley in Webbwood, Ontario became the first woman ever elected as mayor in a general election; in 1951, Charlotte Whitton in Ottawa became the first woman elected mayor of a major Canadian city. Other prominent women mayors in Canada have included June Rowlands and Barbara Hall in Toronto, Val√©rie Plante in Montreal, Jos√©e N√©ron in Saguenay, True Davidson in the former Toronto suburb of East York, Gayle Christie and Frances Nunziata in York, Dianne Haskett and Anne Marie DeCicco- Best in London, Hazel McCallion and Bonnie Crombie in Mississauga, Marianne Meed Ward in Burlington, Marion Dewar and Jacquelin Holzman in Ottawa, Deb Higgins in Moose Jaw, Jan Reimer in Edmonton, Cathy Heron in St. Albert, Tara Veer in Red Deer, Gretchen Brewin and Lisa Helps in Victoria, Sharon Gaetz in Chilliwack, Susan Fennell and Linda Jeffrey in Brampton, Jamie Lim in Timmins, Dorothy Wyatt and Shannie Duff in St. John's, Elsie Wayne in Saint John, Helen Cooper in Kingston, Janice Laking in Barrie, Lorna Jackson and Linda Jackson in Vaughan, Andr√©e Boucher in Quebec City, Dawn Arnold in Moncton, Dorothy Corrigan in Charlottetown, Moira Leiper Ducharme in Halifax, Susan Thompson in Winnipeg, Debbie Amaroso in Sault Ste.

In 1984, Daurene Lewis was elected mayor of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, becoming the first black woman to be elected as a mayor in North America. A study released by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in early 2009 found that women outnumbered men as municipal chief administrative officers or city managers ‚Äì a position which is hired, not elected ‚Äì in Canada. However, they still lagged significantly behind men as elected municipal councillors and mayors, representing just 23 per cent of all elected municipal officials.FCM Municipal Statistics: Male-Female Gender Statistics . January 2009. Only in Canada's three territories, Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, did women represent more than one-third of elected municipal officials at the time of the study, and the Yukon was the only province or territory in all of Canada where more than one-third of all mayors were women. One barrier to women's participation in municipal politics that has been commonly identified is that while a few of Canada's largest cities pay their councillors enough that city council can be a person's sole full-time job, most smaller cities pay their councillors only a modest salary that may not even significantly exceed minimum wage, regardless of how many hours they work ‚Äî making the council effectively a full-time job for only part-time pay, and thus largely restricting the role to people who have the time and resources to balance their council work with another source of income. Among younger women, the fact that family tasks such as child care are still not always divided equitably between fathers and mothers has been identified as an issue; a woman with young children will often have more difficulty finding the time to add a political career to her schedule than her husband does, and may in fact end up being even worse off financially as a councillor's salary may not actually be enough to cover the cost of paid childcare.\\"Province urges women to run in fall municipal election\\". CBC News Edmonton, June 19, 2017. Even older women are not immune to this issue, however; in 2010, Greater Sudbury city councillor Evelyn Dutrisac told the Sudbury Star that she was only able to serve on city council because as a retired teacher she was able to support herself on her Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan income.\\"Politics in Greater Sudbury lacks female voices\\". Sudbury Star, August 20, 2010. The FCM has set the goal of increasing the number of women in municipal government to at least 30 per cent by 2026, and has identified a number of strategies to do so, including mentoring programs, active recruitment of women to serve on municipal boards and committees, and implementing work-life balance programs, such as day care services, to facilitate the participation of women with young children.\\"Getting to 30%\\" . Federation of Canadian Municipalities. Among major Canadian cities, women currently comprise the majority on Mississauga City Council in Mississauga, Ontario, with women holding the mayoralty and six of the 11 ward seats, and represent exactly half of Waterloo City Council in Waterloo, Ontario, with women holding four of the seven ward seats alongside three male councillors and a male mayor. Toronto City Council also surpassed the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' 30 per cent target in the 2010 election, with 15 women councillors representing exactly one-third of the full council.\\"Porter: Female breakthrough on Toronto city council\\". Toronto Star, October 27, 2010. Women have also represented around a third of elected members of Montreal City Council in recent years, but have approached or exceeded 50 per cent of candidates elected to the lower-level borough (arrondissement) councils. In the 2014 municipal election in Esquimalt, British Columbia, women were elected to six of the seven seats (including the mayoralty). This council also included two women under the age of 40 at the time of their election. Viceroyalty Canada is a constitutional monarchy whose head of state, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is represented in Canada by the Governor General and in the provinces by the Lieutenant Governors, who perform the ceremonial functions of the head of state in the Westminster system. The heads of state of the territories are Commissioners representing the federal government, not the Queen. All are ceremonial roles with negligible real political power. The Governor General and Lieutenant Governors are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. Canada has had two female monarchs since Confederation: Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II. Jeanne Sauv√© was the first female Governor General of Canada, appointed in 1984. Three other women have since served as Governor General: Adrienne Clarkson, Micha√´lle Jean, and Julie Payette. The first female Lieutenant Governor was Pauline McGibbon, appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1974. Since then, all ten provinces have had female Lieutenant Governors, and all three territories have had female Commissioners. The first female territorial commissioner was Ione Christensen, who became Commissioner of Yukon in 1979. Helen Maksagak was both the first female Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (in 1995) and of Nunavut (in 1999).

The name Oniscomorpha refers to the millipedes' resemblance to certain woodlice (Oniscidea), also called pillbugs or \\"roly-polies\\". However, millipedes and woodlice are not closely related (belonging to the subphyla Myriapoda and Crustacea, respectively); rather, this is a case of convergent evolution. Description Pill millipedes are relatively short-bodied compared to most other millipedes, with only eleven to thirteen body segments, and are capable of rolling into a ball when disturbed, as a defense against predators. This ability evolved separately in each of the two orders, making it a case of convergent evolution, rather than homology. They can also exude a noxious liquid, which may be both caustic and toxic, to repel predators. Pill millipedes are detritivorous, feeding on decomposing plant matter, usually in woodlands. Comparison of a pill millipede (above: Glomeris marginata) and a pillbug (below: Armadillidium vulgare) Orders =Glomerida= The order Glomerida is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere and includes species such as Glomeris marginata, the common European pill millipede. They have from eleven to twelve body segments, and possess dorsal ozopores (openings of the repugnatorial glands) rather than the lateral ozopores found on many other millipedes. Glomeridans reach maximum lengths of , and eyes, if present, are in a single row of ocelli. The order contains approximately 450 species found in Europe, South-east Asia and the Americas from California to Guatemala. Four species are present in the British Isles. =Sphaerotheriida= The order Sphaerotheriida is a Gondwana-distribution taxon, with around 350 species in southern Africa, Madagascar, Australasia and South East Asia. Five species, all in the genus Procyliosoma are present in New Zealand, and around thirty species are present in Australia. Sphaerotheriidans have thirteen body segments, and do not possess repugnatorial glands. Spherotheriidans reach larger size than Glomeridans (up to ), and always possess large, kidney-shaped eyes. =Amynilyspedida= Oniscomorpha also includes the extinct order Amynilyspedida from the upper Carboniferous of North America and Europe.Hoffman, R.

The Cape honey bee or Cape bee (Apis mellifera capensis) is a southern South African subspecies of the western honey bee. They play a major role in South African agriculture and the economy of the Western Cape by pollinating crops and producing honey in the Western Cape region of South Africa. The Cape honey bee is unique among honey bee subspecies because workers can lay diploid, female eggs, by means of thelytoky, while workers of other subspecies (and, in fact, unmated females of virtually all other eusocial insects) can only lay haploid, male eggs. Not all workers are capable of thelytoky ‚Äì only those expressing the thelytoky phenotype, which is controlled by a recessive allele at a single locus (workers must be homozygous at this locus to be able to reproduce by thelytoky).Lattorff, H.M. G., Mortiz, R.F.A. and Fuchs, S. 2005. A single locus determines thelytokous parthenogenesis of laying honeybee workers (Apis mellifera capensis). Heredity. 94: 533‚Äì537.  Interaction with African bees  In 1990 beekeepers transported Cape honey bees into northern South Africa, where they don't occur naturally. This has created a problem for the region's A. m. scutellata populations.Hepburn, R. 2001. The enigmatic Cape honey bee, \\"Apis mellifera capensis\\". Bee World. 82: 181‚Äì191. Reproducing diploid females without fertilization bypasses the eusocial insect hierarchy; an individual more related to her own offspring than to the offspring of the queen will trade in her inclusive fitness benefits for individual fitness benefits of reproducing her own young.Hamilton, W.D. 1964. Genetic evolution of social behavior I. Journal of Theoretical Biology. 7: 1. This opens up the possibility of social parasitism: if a female worker expressing the thelytokous phenotype from a Cape honey bee colony can enter a colony of A. m. scutellata, she can potentially take over that African bee colony.Hepburn, H.R. and M.H. Allsopp. Reproductive conflict between honeybees ‚Äì usurpation of \\"Apis mellifera scutellata\\" colonies by \\"Apis mellifera capensis\\". South African Journal of Science. 90: 247‚Äì249. A behavioral consequence of the thelytoky phenotype is queen pheromonal mimicry, which means the parasitic workers can sneak their eggs in to be raised with those from the African bees, and their eggs aren't policed by the African bee workers because they're similar to the African bee queen's eggs.Wossler, T.C. 2002. Pheromone mimicry by \\"Apis mellifera capensis\\" social parasites leads to reproductive anarchy in host \\"Apis mellifera scutellata\\" colonies. Apidologie. 33: 139‚Äì163. As a result the parasitic A. m. capensis workers increase in number within a host colony, while numbers of the A. m. scutellata workers that perform foraging duties (A. m. capensis workers are greatly under-represented in the foraging force of an infested colony) dwindle, owing to competition in egg laying between A. m. capensis workers and the queen, and to the eventual death of the queen. This causes the death of the colony upon which the capensis females depended, so they will then seek out a new host colony. Martin, S.J. Beekman, M., Wossler, T.C., Ratnieks, F.L.W. (2002) Parasitic Cape honeybee workers, Apis mellifera capensis, evade policing. Nature 415, 163‚Äì165  Conservation status  In December 2008 American foulbrood disease spread to the Cape honey bee population in the Western Cape infecting and wiping out an estimated forty percent of the region's honey bee population by 2015. Over 300 hives were destroyed and more hives threatened with starvation in 2017 when large fires swept through the Knysna area of the Western Cape. Due to the impact of the fires on the bee's already threatened status resources were donated to setup additional hive stands and basil and borage after the fire to provide food to the bees. Additional fires, at the same time, in the Thornhill area (near Port Elizabeth) destroyed a further 700 hives. The use of pesticides by the agricultural sector is suspected of being responsible for at least one large incident of large scale hive death with an estimated 100 hives killed off on Constantia wine farms. Thelytokous parthenogenesis and maintenance of heterozygosity The effects of central fusion and terminal fusion on heterozygosity Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilized egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote. Cape honeybee workers expressing the thelytoky phenotype can produce progeny by automictic thelytoky with central fusion (see diagram). Central fusion allows heterozygosity to be largely maintained. The oocytes that undergo automixis display a greater than 10-fold reduction in the rate of crossover recombination. The low recombination rate in automictic oocytes favors maintenance of heterozygosity and the avoidance of inbreeding depression.

My Little Pony aired the first 15 minutes, and the second half rotated among MoonDreamers, Potato Head Kids, and Glo Friends. The show was made by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions in collaboration with Toei Animation. It rebroadcast on (CBN) Family Channel (known today as Freeform) from 1989 to 1995 during My Little Pony. The Glo Friends toyline, which preceded the television show, are small glow-in-the-dark toys in the shape of insects and other small creatures (including the original Glo Worm) that were made by Hasbro's Playskool division in the mid-1980s (Glo Worm was introduced in 1982). Books were also made by Ladybird to accompany each Glo Friend. Premise The title protagonists in The Glo Friends were a community of small, glow-in-the-dark bugs that live in Glo Land, a magical kingdom located in the middle of a forest. Their homes are built near the Glo Pond, from where they harvest a substance known as Moondrops. It is Moondrops that sustain the Glo Friends and enable their ability to glow in the dark. The Glo Friends peaceful existence is threatened constantly by the Moligans, a group of mole-like creatures led by Starnose. The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful digging, mob action, robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are short-sighted, they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which would enable them to see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia. Characters =Glo Friends= * Baby Glo Worm (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) - She is the youngest member of the Glo Friends community. She is seen spending most of her time along Glo Grannybug (see below). She is quite curious and often giggles. She also speaks, but only in short sentences. In the debut episode of the Glo Friends TV show Baby Glo Worm goes Bye-Bye, she escaped from her bed while the other Glo Friends were trying to sing a lullaby to make her sleep, and consequently got lost in the Moligans¬¥ Tunnels, putting the other Glo Friends into trouble when they set off to find her. * Garden Ant - He spends his time taking care of his plants and flowers. He cultivates vegetables for the Glo Friend community, and has a vast knowledge about them. He can't tolerate seeing the Moligans eating the roots of a tree, as seen in the episodes Forest Brigade (in which he protects his personal tree) and even in Easy Money Pt. 2 when a Moleslavian villager is selling \\"Root dogs\\" (like Hot Dogs with roots instead of sausages). He is a regular character in the TV series. His house is a sort of pumpkin located in Glo Land. ** Bunny Rabbit - A rabbit who is Garden Ant's best friend. * Glo Bashfulbug - As her name indicates, Glo Bashfulbug is a female Glo Friend that doesn't know what to say in certain moments. Sometimes, she shows an attraction for Glo Worm, one of the bravest and smartest Glo Friends. In more than one moment, she said to Glo Worm that being brave is hard. She is a regular character in the TV series. * Glo Bedbug - She is the laziest of the Glo Friends. The only things she usually wants to do is eating, singing, and sleeping. Sometimes, she plays. * Glo Bonnie Beetle - She is another female Glo Friend. According to her description, she is very sweet. She doesn't appear in the TV series. * Glo Bookbug - * Glo Bopbug - He is an eight-legged Glo Friend that wears a top hat and shoes, and uses a cane. He is a regular character in the TV series. He likes to dance. In the Spanish dub of the show, he was called \\"Abuelete\\", literally translated as \\"Granddaddy\\" * Glo Butterfly - She carries a magic wand. She believes that she can do magic tricks, although she actually can't. In the episode Make no mistake, it's magic, the other Glo Friends said that it is better not to tell her that her \\"magic tricks\\" are just coincidences, in order to keep her happy. * Glo Bug (voiced by Charlie Adler) - He is sometimes considered the bravest of the Glo Friends. He is not afraid of danger. For example, in the first part of The Quest, he can't tolerate that Rook and the Red Ant army are destroying the forest and for that reason, without wasting time thinking, he dares to run into Rook and face him. For some reason, in the TV series and in his Playskool-Hasbro figure, his hat is pink, while in other media, such as the Ladybird books, his hat has multicoloured strips. * Glo Cappy (voiced by Russi Taylor) - He loves going to explore the forests riding on Country Mouse and acts as a reporter of Glo Land. He informs the others about the dangers or anything worth to mention. He and his friend wear a blue cap. ** Country Mouse - A mouse who is Glo Cappy's best friend. * Glo Clutterbug - He is a clumsy insect that usually messes up the situation, and puts the other Glo Friends into trouble. He often falls into traps. * Glo Cricket - * Glo Doodlebug (voiced by Will Ryan) - He loves art. He often gets frustrated when he feels that his artworks or his painting style are not appreciated. In the episode \\"The Masterpiece,\\" Glo Doodlebug decides to leave Glo Land in order to go to a cave (accompanied by Snugbug) that he uses as a personal studio. He is a regular character in the TV series. * Glo Firefly - He has a name that has double-meaning: his job is being a firefighter and he is a firefly. He doesn't appear in the TV series. * Glo Flutterbug - His figure was only available through mail order as Glo Prayerbug. He doesn't appear in the TV series. * Glo Grannybug - She is the wisest and oldest Glo Friend. She lives in the biggest treehouse of Glo Land. She often tells stories to the other Glo Friends and she is often seen taking care of Baby Glo Worm. She also loves celebrating parties with homemade food at the Full Moon Days, in which Moondrops falls to the Earth, as seen for examples in the episode \\"Beware the Tales of Gold.\\" * Glo Hopper - He is a green-bodied grasshopper who is usually seen riding on Glo Turtle. He tends to jump high under several circumstances, including surprise, happiness, etc. ** Glo Turtle - A turtle who is Glo Hopper's best friend. * Glo Horsefly - * Glo Nuttybug - * Glo Prayerbug - She is a blue mantis-shaped Glo Friend that, as her name indicates, prays when something goes wrong. She appeared very few times in the TV show (only in the 10-part adventure The Quest and in The Glo Friends save Christmas special) and she had only very few lines. Her toy figure was only available in the US and Canada by mail order. * Glo Scuttlebug (voiced by Mona Marshall) - He is a skypilot that rides on Dragonflyer. He is a regular character in the TV series. ** Dragonflyer - A dragonfly who is Glo Shuttlebug's best friend that acts as a plane. * Glo Skunkbug - He is a stinking Glo Friend with purple nose (Most of the other Glo Friends have a red nose).

He is very brave and in several moments he and his frog friend have excellent ideas when fighting against their enemies. He is a regular character in the TV series. The only moment in which he was seen playing a baseball match with the other Glo Friends was in the episode Bean Ball. ** Bullyfrog (voiced by Frank Welker) - A bullfrog who is Glo Sluggerbug's best friend. * Glo Snail (voiced by Don Messick) - * Glo Sniffles Snail - He has a constant cold. He doesn't appear in the TV series. * Glo Snugbug - She is a pink caterpillar-shaped Glo Friend. She is not a regular character in the TV series. She only appeared during the 10-part episode The Quest and The Masterpiece, in which she seemed to show feelings for Glo Doodlebug. She tends to hug all his friends. * Glo Spider - * Glo Tootlebug - * Glo Waterbug - Glo Waterbug is a sailor insect. He guards the Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck. ** Dipper Ducky (voiced by Charlie Adler) - A duck who is Glo Waterbug's best friend. He guards Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck. * Glo Worm (voiced by Pat Fraley) - He is the original Glo Friend, and is the unofficial leader of the Glo Friends in the TV series. He is quite brave and smart. He wears purple pyjamas, although the original Glo Worm toy portrays him as wearing green pyjamas. This was a source of some controversy. =Glo Wees= A race of fairies that can glow like the Glo Friends. They are known to be nature's helpers: * Dapple - * Nippin - * Nutcap (voiced by Hal Rayle) - A Glo Wee that carries around the Book of Nature which enables him to communicate with nature. * Posey (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) - * Spruce - A Glo Wee who is an expert juggler. * Willow - A Glo Wee who conducts the symphony of nature. =Villains= * Moligans - The Moligans are the primary antagonists of the series. After being banished from Moleslavia for their crimes, they sought to start their mine and mine for gold in order to get enough to buy out Moleslavia. To accomplish this, they always try to target the Glo Friends to power their lanterns with no success. ** Starnose (voiced by Roger C. Carmel) - Starnose is the leader of the Moligans. He is physically tough and it is mentioned that he is able to scare anyone who tries to ignore his orders. In the Spanish dub of the Glo Friends TV Show, he was called \\"Narizotas\\", literally translated as \\"Big Nose\\". ** Nails (voiced by Susan Silo) - Nails is a selfish and egocentrical Moligan lady that only worries about her physical appearance or anything in her own benefit. She likes valuable and shining body complements (such as rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, etc.) and she doesn't tolerate that anyone calls her an \\"ugly witch\\" (or similar attributions). She seems to have an attraction to Starnose, and can often be seen clinging to him, but that may just be her trying to get close to the main power of the group. She also serves as the cook of the Moligans as seen in \\"Wizard of Rook.\\" ** Old Moldy (voiced by Roger C. Carmel) - As his name indicates, Old Moldy is the oldest Moligan in the group. He needs to use a hammer-shape cane due to his old age and has seen a lot of things in his youth. Since he was young, his main dream was to melt a piece of gold to turn it in a huge river of gold. In the episode \\"Caverns of Mystery,\\" his old mine was seen. ** Excavator (voiced by Charlie Adler) - Excavator is the second oldest Moligan in the group. He is a scientist that usually remains in his personal laboratory doing chemical experiments or inventing new mining artifacts such as the Bi-Pedal Turbo Tunneler (seen in two episodes of the TV show). In the Spanish dub of the TV series, he was called \\"Inventor\\". ** Brasher (voiced by Hal Rayle) - Brasher is a tall and intellectual Moligan. It is said that he has the best ideas about how to get the gold and the Glo Friends, but Starnose hears and takes them as they were of his own to consider himself as the \\"main brain of the Moligans\\". ** Smasher (voiced by Charlie Adler) - Smasher is Brasher's brother. Unlike Brasher, Smasher is (or acts as) stupid and dumb. Physically, he is tall and tough. He feels the need of \\"smashing\\" at least one Glo Friend (during the 10-part episode The Quest, he is seen several times trying to damage the Glo Friends in order to force them to work for the Moligans). ** Scoop (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) - Scoop is the youngest Moligan. She is also the only nice Moligan, often secretly sabotaging Starnose's plots, and is friends with the Glo Friends, but fears to leave the Moligans. She wears tight clothing and has a tall auburn hairdo and a braided ponytail. ** Tumbler - Tumbler is the shortest Moligan. He is also lazy, doing as little digging as possible, and is very gullible, often taking throwaway comments at face value. * Rook (voiced by Hal Rayle) - Rook is a crow who used to work for Lord Driver of the Red Ant Army. After Driver left, the Moligans enlisted Rook as a spy and lookout. He has little love for his employers, once even dishing out the dirt on them to the Glo Friends newspaper. * The Red Ant Army - They are a group of insects in a desert valley and Rook's former employers. They are led by Lord Driver (voiced by Frank Welker). They only appeared in \\"The Quest\\" in which they captured the Moligans and Glo Friends. It was because of them that the Moligans learned of the Glo Friends and their illumination abilities. Due to a breakout of the Moligans and the Glo Friends, Lord Driver and the Red Ant Army took flight when their kingdom ended up having a cave-in. * Blanche (voiced by Sally Struthers) ‚Äì The Wicked Witch of the North Pole. Dressed in purple fur, she appears on the Christmas special along with her live weasel furry scarf (voiced by Charlie Adler) and had an icicle wand. She trapped Santa Claus and his DearDeers (reindeer) in an ice cage in a plot to stop Christmas. =Others= * The Jester brothers (voiced by unknown) ‚Äì They are pink court jesters of the Red Ant Army. They are comic relief characters and they only appeared in the episode: \\"The Quest\\" and \\"Easy Money part 1 & 2\\". They are the ones who insulted Nails the most by calling her a witch and Jumping in a punch bowl soaking her. However that was because the Red Ant Army had an engagement to send them to King Mole's party and the wanted to taste the punch drink. In the French dub they are instead called Jester sisters of to the translation of the French word soeurs meaning sisters.

Parris, ¬´ Albert Cossery, Montreur d'hommes ‚Äì L'≈ìuvre en langue fran√ßaise d'un auteur √©gyptien ¬ª [archive], √©ditions Peter Lang, 2009, (), p. 137. Although Cossery lived most of his life in Paris and only wrote in the French language, all of his novels were either set in his home country of Egypt or in an imaginary Middle Eastern country. He was nicknamed \\"The Voltaire of the Nile\\". His writings pay tribute to the humble and to the misfits of his childhood in Cairo, as well as praise a form of laziness and simplicity very distant from our contemporary society. Albert Cossery was well known in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, where he lived in the same hotel, Hotel La Louisiane, since 1945.  Life  Montparnasse Albert Cossery (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ÿ™ ŸÇÿµŸäÿ±Ÿä) was born in Cairo to a Greek Orthodox family of Syrian descent. His parents were wealthy small-property owners that originally owned land in Damietta. In a conversation with Lebanese writer Abdallah Naaman in 1998, Cossery said, \\"We are the \\"Shawams\\" (Levantines, referring to the Bilad al-Sham) of Egypt. My father is a Greek Orthodox native of the village of al-Qusayr, near Homs, in Syria. Upon arriving in Cairo at the end of the 19th century, the family adopted \\"Cossery\\" (after al-Qusayr) as their family name due to its simplified pronunciation.\\" The Cossery family, as well as all of the elites living in Egypt during this era, were well steeped in French culture. At the age of 17, inspired by reading Honor√© de Balzac, he emigrated to Paris to continue studies that he never completed, writing and settled permanently in the French capital in 1945, where he lived until his death in 2008. In 60 years he only wrote eight novels, in accordance with his philosophy of life in which \\"laziness\\" is not a vice but a form of contemplation and meditation. In his own words: \\"So much beauty in the world, so few eyes to see it.\\" At the age of 27 he published his first book, Les hommes oubli√©s de Dieu (\\"Men God Forgot\\"). During his literary career he became close friend of other writers and artists such as Lawrence Durrell, Albert Camus, Jean Genet and Giacometti. Cossery died on 22 June 2008, aged 94.Albert Cossery, 'Voltaire of the Nile,' dies at 94 , AFP, 22 June 2008 His books, which always take place in Egypt or other Arab countries, portray the contrast between poverty and wealth, the powerful and the powerless, in a witty although dramatic way. His writing mocks vanity and the narrowness of materialism and his principal characters are mainly vagrants, thieves or dandies that subvert the order of an unfair society. His novels often feature auto-biographical characters, like Teymour, the hero of the novel Un complot de saltimbanques, a young man who forges a diploma in chemical engineering after a life of enjoyment and lust abroad instead of study and gets back to his home town and enters into an unexpected intringue against the authorities with his dandy friends. He is considered by some to be the last genuine \\"anarchist\\" or free thinking writer of western culture by his humorous and provocative although lucid and profound view of human relations and society. His writing style does not submit to an academic or experimental approach which makes him a vivid, catchy storyteller, without the boredom nor artificial ambiguity of some classical (which he is) or avantgarde writers. The sageness of his works are monuments to the freedom of being and thought against materialism, the contemporary obsession with consumption and productivity, the arrogance and abuse of authority, the vanity of social formalities and the injustice of the wealthy towards the poor. In 1990 Cossery was awarded the Grand prix de la francophonie of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and in 2005 the Grand Prix Poncetton de la SGDL. The first of his books translated in English are Men God Forgot (first translated by Harold Edwards of Faruk University, Alexandria, Egypt, not by Henry Miller, whose note on Cossery appeared on a later 1963 City Lights Books edition, and published in the United States in 1946 by George Leite's Circle Editions of Berkeley), The House of Certain Death (New Directions, 1949), The Lazy Ones (New Directions, 1952), and Proud Beggars (Black Sparrow Press, 1981). Three more of Cossery's novels have since been published in English translation: Anna Moschovakis' The Jokers (NYRB Classics) and Alyson Waters' A Splendid Conspiracy and The Colors of Infamy (New Directions). As of 2014, Une ambition dans le d√©sert remains untranslated into English.

The river's course is used to define all or portions of the southern boundaries of Orange, Spotsylvania and Caroline counties; and the northern boundaries of Louisa and Hanover counties. It joins the South Anna River to form the Pamunkey River on the common boundary of Caroline and Hanover counties, about northeast of the town of Ashland.

Since Damasus compares him to Stephen, he may have been a deacon; however, a 6th-century account makes him an acolyte. According to one version of the detailed legend that developed later, Tarsicius was a young boy during one of the fierce 3rd-century Roman persecutions, probably during the reign of Emperor Valerian (253‚Äì259). One day, he was entrusted with the task of bringing the Eucharist to condemned Christians in prison.Stevens, Clifford. The One Year Book of Saints, Our Sunday Visitor Books, Huntington, Indiana. He preferred death at the hands of a mob rather than deliver to them the Blessed Sacrament which he was carrying. Veneration He was originally buried in the Catacombs of San Callisto and the inscription by Damasus was placed later on his tomb. Some time later his relics were moved to the San Silvestro in Capite church in Rome. His feast day is celebrated on 15 August; that day is widely observed as the Feast of the Assumption, therefore he is not mentioned in the General Roman Calendar, but only in the Roman Martyrology. Patronage He is the patron saint of altar servers and first communicants.Bittle O.F.M. Cap., Berchman. A Saint A Day, The Bruce Publishing Company, Milwaukee, 1958 Legacy His story was greatly expanded by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, who portrays him as a young acolyte in his novel Fabiola, or the Church in the Catacombs. The municipality of Saint-Tharcisius in Quebec, Canada, is named after him, as well as a 35 kilogram (77 lb) bell in the Stephansdom in Vienna, Austria. Saint Jos√© S√°nchez del R√≠o was nicknamed \\"Tarcisius\\". Poem by Damasus The first five lines say that both Stephen (the protomartyr) and Tarsicius are equal in merit, and Stephen's death (as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles) is retold poetically. The last four lines can be translated as: When an insane gang pressed saintly Tarsicius, who was carrying the sacraments of Christ, to display them to the profane, he preferred to be killed and give up his life rather than betray to rabid dogs the heavenly body.

It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg secondary schools. Academics Timothy Hamer has been the school's president while Terry Klugh has been principal since the departure of Thomas S. Fertal. The administration is traditionally structured with a vice principal and dean of students (discipline). The school is coeducational and runs on a traditional quarter system. As a parochial school, LCHS requires all students to take one credit (full-year course) of religious study for each year of their duration at the school. LCHS offers levels of classes including general, academic, honors and AP classes on a minimum college-prep level. =GPA Weighting= Classes are weighted according to academic challenge. Foundations classes (4.0 scale), College Prep classes (4.5 scale), Honors (5.0 scale), AP (5.5 scale) Good Samaritan Program Service is an integral part of the educational process at Lancaster Catholic High School. The Good Samaritan Program was established by James Rogers for all students to foster the proclamation of the Gospel, and to form good habits of service to others. The program is promoted with two goals in mind: first, to help fulfill the needs of many community and civic organizations, as well as churches and parishes, who rely on volunteer hours to accomplish many of their own goals; and second, to give all students at Lancaster Catholic High School an opportunity to be of service to the Church, school, and community. Each student, as approved by Lancaster Catholic High School Board policy, is required to perform 20 hours of non-remunerated (no salary or wages) service to school, church, or community per year. Accredited service must be performed at an approved location or have the approval of the Director of Service. Athletics LCHS is a member of the Lancaster-Lebanon League as part of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association primarily competing in Section 4 (Section 1, 2 or 3 in some sports). Richard Hinnenkamp is the school's Athletic Director. =PIAA sports= * Men's/women's basketball * Men's/women's soccer * Men's/women's track and field * Men's/women's cross country * Men's/women's swimming/diving * Men's/women's tennis * Men's golf (open to women) * Men's bowling (open to women) * Men's wrestling * Men's football (co-op with Lancaster Mennonite School) * Men's baseball * Women's softball * Women's field hockey * Women's/men's cheerleading *Women's volleyball (co-op with Lancaster Country Day School) Football Beginning in 1950 when the LCHS football team posted a 7-1-1 record and won the Central Penn Catholic Football League Championship, to the Edward Maley and Ben Charles (USC) guided 1956 Central Penn Catholic Football League Championship team which compiled a 10-0 record and the days of James Paul (1961‚Äì64) the first alumnus to play in the NFL with the Denver Broncos, there has been a tradition of excellence when it comes to the football program. In 1974, LCHS, led by Phil Kirchner and Bob Gramola, won the highly competitive Tri-County Football League Championship. This was the last championship until a group of athletes under the guidance of Coach Joe Mack and linebacker Tom Burger (Duke), Chris Hogarth (William and Mary), Steve France (Ohio State), and Eric Baumgardner (Syracuse), to mention a few, returned the team to glory in the 1980s. The 1982 team won the inaugural District III AA title, and the 1983 team won a second consecutive title. That team beat a Bishop McDevitt team led by James Bryant (Ohio State), Sean Barowski (Penn State), and future NFL running back Ricky Watters (ND) 7-6. In 1998, the team won a Section III title under the guidance of Coach Tony DiPaolo, whose 156-97-6 record over a twenty-five-year coaching career makes him the winningest football coach in school history. After returning to the gridiron in 1993, DiPaolo stepped down in 2001. His teams consistently fronted strong defensive squads. In 2003, Bruce Harbach took over the Crusader football program. Through the 2009 season, his overall record stands at 78-23. During his tenure as Head Coach, the Crusaders have appeared in the District 3 AA playoffs five straight years. His teams appeared in four of the last five District 3 AA Championship games from 2004‚Äì08, taking home two gold medals in 2005 and 2008. The Crusaders made their first ever state playoff appearance in 2005, and in 2008 they advanced to the Eastern Finals and state semi-finals, losing to Philadelphia West Catholic. The Crusaders have won four straight Lancaster/Lebanon League Section 3 titles, went undefeated in the regular season in 2005 and 2006 (10-0), and set school records by recording the most wins in a season during the 2008 campaign, at 13-2. Harbach has been named Lancaster/Lebanon League Section 3 Coach of the Year by his peers three times (2005, 2006, and 2007). Lancaster Catholic won 24 regular season games from 2004 to 2007. The Crusaders have won 34 of 35 Section 3 L/L League games and have finished in the top 10 in the state rankings in the past five years in the state's AA classification. In 2009, the Crusaders compiled a 15-1 record, losing only to Manheim Central in week 3. The team went on to claim the PIAA State AA Championship at Hersheypark Stadium in a driving snowstorm by defeating Greensburg Central Catholic 21-14. Quarterback Kyle Smith and wide receiver Tyler Purvis were named to the all-state AA first team, with K Geoffrey Arentz and halfback Jordan Stewart capturing second team honors. The state title marked the first in the history of Lancaster Catholic's storied program. In 2011, the team compiled a perfect 16-0 record en route to another PIAA AA State Championship. In 2012, the team moved from AA to AAA for PIAA competitions.

From 2003 to 2007, Mike Hoffman was the head coach for the Crusaders. Before retiring from the game, Hoffman led his last team to a District 3 Class AA semifinal appearance in the spring of 2007.

With the most recent reclassification of PIAA sports for the 2016-2017 school year, the baseball team has been reclassified as AAA (up from AA) out of the new 6-classification format (up from a 4-tier classification system). Basketball The boys' basketball program had varied success up until the late 1990s and the 2000s. Since the 1970s LCHS has qualified for the LL League Championships 14 times (the fourth most in league history), earned five second-place finishes (second most in league history), and captured the title in 2003. From 2000 to 2010 the program recorded nine out of 11 section championships, which included a string of seven straight, numerous District III playoff appearances with a title in 2003 and 2011 and a second-place finish in 2010. Since 2001 LCHS has qualified for the PIAA Championships seven times. The 2003 boys' basketball team posted a record of 35-0, the greatest in state history on their way to the PIAA AAA state championship. The Crusaders had previously competed at the AA level. Lancaster Catholic defeated Oxford 87-76, Allentown Central Catholic 61-57, Harriton 74-69, and Steelton-Highspire 66-60 in the PIAA playoffs, before downing Perry Traditional Academy of Pittsburgh in the finals 75-59. The 75 points was the most scored in a Class AAA championship since Pottstown beat Valley, 85-66, in 1993. Their season total of 2509 points ranked #1 in Pennsylvania in 2003. Greg Testa (Millersville University - basketball) played a big role in the win with his ballhandling and shooting, while Ryan Purvis (Boston College - football), a 6-5 junior center, made 10 of 15 shots from the field, scored 25 points and pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds. Head Coach Bill Southward was named the state's Triple-A Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. He is the first basketball coach from Lancaster County to receive the AP's State Coach of the Year award, and he is believed to be the first county coach from any sport to earn an AP State Coach of the Year award. Southward retired after 11 years at Catholic, six as the head coach. He posted a 144-36 record. The boys' program compiled a winning streak of 46 straight games from 2002 to 2004, which is known to be in the top 20 basketball winning streaks in state history. Led by Lamar Kauffman, who is in his 26th season at the helm of the Lady Crusaders, the girls' basketball team has seen great success and is noted as one of the premier programs in the PIAA. The team has 13 District 3 AAA championships to their credit, and the 1996 team won the PIAA state AAA title, one of three under his guidance. Kauffman is known for his high-pressure defense and intense off-season conditioning. The program boasts the most state titles of any in the school and the 1974 team which went 27-0, winning the PIAA Girls' State Basketball Championship, the first state championship title for any team sport in school history. In 2002 Katie Hayek graduated from LCHS and became a co-captain for the University of Miami Women's Basketball team. During her four-year high school career, she became LCHS's second-leading all- time scorer with 1,510 career points. She averaged 20.6 points, four rebounds and four assists per game her senior season and also led her team in assists and steals. She earned All-Star honors from the Intelligencer Journal, Harrisburg Patriot News and the New Era, and was named to the Pennsylvania All-State Second Team by the Associated Press in her senior year. Track and field The boys' track team in the 1980s under the tutelage of coaches Andy Benko, Tom Simpson, Joe Bering, and Lou Portas, posted some of the school's most impressive win records. From 1980 to 1986 the team lost just one dual meet; in 1985 it had its finest season ever, as the team captured the PIAA State championship, the first ever for LCHS's boys' track and field team. Since then their success has been down. However, in the past decade the track and field teams have captured several men's and women's section titles, and have sent competitors to the Penn Relays under Coaches Sandy Guilfoyle and Maureen McElrone. They have also repeatedly sent athletes to district and state track meets, bringing home numerous medals. Wrestling Current Lancaster County commissioner Scott Martin was a state champion for the Crusaders in the 1990s. Under coach Tom Vargo, from 1972-1987 the program's overall record was 184-61-3, with one Central Penn Catholic League Championship in 1974, L-L League Section II Championships in 1980 and 1981 and an L-L League Section I Co-Championship in 1983. LCHS teams won PIAA District III AAA Championships in 1982 and 1983 and a PIAA District III AA Championship in 1985. The current coach is Tom Blaszczyk. =Non-PIAA sports= The men's lacrosse team is a joint program with J.P. McCaskey High School and Lancaster Country Day High School. Lancaster Catholic is in a CPIHL joint program with Conestoga Valley High School for men's ice hockey. The team has done well in recent years, always atop the tier 3 ladder.

The lift was a component of the sport of Olympic weightlifting from 1928 to 1972, but was removed due to difficulties in judging proper technique.  Movement  = Clean phase = In the clean movement, after taking a big breath and setting the back, the lifter jumps the bar up through triple extension (in very quick succession) of the hips, knees and then ankles. When the legs have driven the bar as high as possible, the lifter pulls under the bar by violently shrugging (contracting) the trapezius muscles of the upper back (\\"traps\\") dropping into a deep squat position and spinning the hands around the bar so the elbows are extended in front. At the same time, the arms are brought up with the elbows extended in front of the chest so the bar may now lie across or \\"rest\\" across the palms, the front of the shoulder or deltoid muscles, and the clavicles. At this point the lifter should be in a full squat position, with his buttocks on or very close to the heels, sitting erect with the bar resting comfortably across the deltoids and fingers. By keeping a rigid torso and maintaining a deep breath hold the bar bends over the lifter's clavicle. The improvement in construction of modern weightlifting bars has greatly increased this springing action compared with bars used in the first half of the twentieth century. This springing action is used to rebound from the full bottom squat position. This is commonly known as a front squat. = Press phase = Once the bar is on the anterior deltoids, the lifter proceeds to an overhead press. Eventually the technique was to stand erect, then dip in the knees slightly and spring up with the legs and back, pressing upwards. From there, the lifter would drop back into a layback position to receive the weight past the sticking point. Finally, the lifter would stand erect with the weight locked out at arms' length overhead. All of this is done within a matter of a couple of seconds. During the Olympics, many lifters lie back while pressing. That is said only because there were a few lifters who did not lean back to receive the weight overhead. Of course, that is because that stricter form of pressing could not get as much weight as the far looser style of pressing employed by the champions, which allowed much more weight to be pressed.  Removal from the Olympics  The International Weightlifting Federation removed the clean and press after the 1972 Olympics due to difficulty in judging form. The press portion of the lift had evolved from an upright, rigid body movement to a \\"layback\\" movement that involved the larger muscles of the legs, hips, and torso, enabling the lifter to \\"cheat\\" to lift more weight. \\"The urge to win by any means, combined with lax enforcement of rules\\" resulted in its removal from the Olympic weightlifting program.

The name Sconeville was replaced in 1868 to mark the career of Solomon Chesley, an official in the pre-Confederation Indian Department. Its town slogan is \\"The Nicest Town Around.\\" Chesley is located north of both Walkerton on Bruce Road 19 and Hanover on County Road 10. The town was named after Solomon Chesley, a former official in the Indian Department in Canada West. It is now an example of a typical rural Ontario community. Chesley originally developed around mills built on the Saugeen River around 1858. It expanded further when it was connected to the Grand Trunk Railroad in 1881. A great fire destroyed most of the original downtown core in 1888, and the destroyed wood buildings were replaced by brick and stone. From 1877 to 2004, the town had a weekly newspaper called The Chesley Enterprise. The town's major source of employment is commercial manufacturing. From 1886 to 1987, the Krug family operated the Krug Bros. furniture manufacturing business. Currently Crate Designs,Crate Designs a locally owned furniture manufacturing factory, is the only surviving furniture factory, following the recent downsizing of Durham Furniture (2007). Chesley is part of the Bluewater District School Board and has a junior kindergarten to grade 8 school called the Chesley District Community School.Chesley District Community School In 2014, the original Chesley District High School joined with the Kinghurst Community School to form a junior kindergarten to grade 12 facility. In 2017, the high school section closed and it is now a junior kindergarten to grade 8 facility. A number of franchises also exist in the town, including New Orleans Pizza, Rona, Home Hardware, and Rexall Drugs. The town is known for the statue of a giant bull on the north end of town, which is affectionately known as \\"Big Bruce.\\" Recently the town has begun to create a network of walking trails that encompasses much of the town's existing infrastructure of walking paths. Known as the heritage trail, it spans a large part of the town, and its waterside parks. In 2005, Chesley was able to open a Heritage and Woodworking Museum due to a Trillium Foundation grant. The museum was housed in the Dawson House on 1st Avenue, formerly the home of town doctors Stewart and Dawson. The building had been left to the town for public use in the 1970s; in 2013, Chesley put Dawson House up for sale.

CST; sometimes referred to as Cox Sports TV) is an American regional sports cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Cox Communications. The channel, which serves the Gulf South region of the United States, features a mix of professional, collegiate and high school sporting events. Cox Sports Television is headquartered in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, Louisiana. History Launched on October 28, 2002, the creation of the network played a key role in the relocation of the New Orleans Hornets NBA franchise from Charlotte, North Carolina. The only regional sports network serving New Orleans area viewers at the time was Fox Sports Southwest, and its coverage of Louisiana sporting events was limited. From 2005 to 2010, Charter Communications did not carry the network on its Louisiana systems, despite having a carriage deal in place at the channel's launch in 2002. Because of this, Hornets games were not available to people living outside of the New Orleans metropolitan area during this time. In 2008, Cox and Charter negotiated a proposal to allow three Hornets games to be carried on local origination channels operated by Charter in the lead-up to that year's NBA All-Star Game as a precursor to a deal, however the discussions ended without a contract. On December 15, 2010, Cox announced that it had finally reached a deal with Charter to carry the network on its systems again starting in 2011, a move done with the belief that the Hornets would remain in New Orleans for the foreseeable future.Report: Hornets to be carried on Northshore cable , WWL-TV, December 15, 2010.

Shiloh had its own post office in operation here in the early 20th century. History The first white settlers in what is now Tyler County, WV came in the late 1790s or very early 19th century. Tyler County was once a part of Ohio County Va(WV). One of the first families in Shiloh was the Cornell family. Jacob and his wife Druscilla Ankrom purchased land along Middle Island Creek. A farm was started and was home to a least 4 generations of Cornells. The land was sold out of Cornell ownership in 1945 after Luella Cornell died in 1944. A Cornell farmhouse remained on the original land until it burned in the late 1990s. Jacob Cornell and his wife Druscilla Ankrom remained buried on this land until this day. The town is also the namesake for the fictional beagle dog in the children's book quartet Shiloh (novel), written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed November 7, 2011 through the central Lower Peninsula. The Chippewa is a tributary of the Tittabawassee River and is thus part of the Saginaw River drainage basin. The river is named after the Chippewa people (the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation is located in Isabella County). The main stem of the river begins in northeast Mecosta County in the village of Barryton at where the north and west branches are impounded. The North Branch Chippewa River, also known as Chippewa Creek (there is a second North Branch Chippewa River further east), rises at as the outflow of Big Cranberry Lake in Garfield Township in southwest Clare County. The West Branch Chippewa River rises as the outflow of Tubbs Lake, part of a complex of lakes formed by Winchester Dam several miles southwest of Barryton. The Winchester Dam, built in 1954, impounds and forms the Martiny Lake Flooding. The dam, which is owned by the State of Michigan, is identified as a \\"significant hazard due to its proximity to the Village of Barryton.\\" An 1879 atlas of Mecosta County gives an indication of the area's geography before the dam was built. Several of the lakes that now form lobes in a continuous body of water are clearly seen as separate lakes, some with different names or spellings. Tubbs Lake is called \\"Tebbs Lake\\" and Diamond Lake is \\"Dimon Lake\\". The \\"second\\" North Branch Chippewa River rises as the outflow of Grass Lake near the boundary between Isabella and Clare counties at and flows south through into the Chippewa River at a few miles west of Mount Pleasant. The river flows through Mt. Pleasant and is the focal point of four parks in the city: Millpond Park, Nelson Park, Chipp-A-Water, and Island Park. In Island Park, the river flows completely around the park and creates a natural island in the center of the city. Three additional Isabella County parks utilize the river for recreation: Meridian Park, Deerfield Nature Park, and Majeski Landing. The river flows east into Midland County where it is joined by the Pine River at the Chippewa Nature Center in Homer Township, then joins the Tittabawassee River in downtown Midland under The Tridge. The river flows with a mean discharge rate of 254 cubic feet per second (7.19 cubic meters per second) at its gauge near Mount Pleasant.USGS Real-time Water Data for Chippewa River, Michigan It is locally known for bass fishing. Chubs and redhorses are also abundant. There are two canoe liveries on the river: Chippewa River Outfitters and Buckley's Mountainside Canoe Livery. The liveries offer canoe, kayak, and tubing trips for a few hours to all day, even an overnight camping trip. The river flows through a gravel pit named Hubsher Gravel Pit.

It is often used to identify performance issues with storage devices, including local disks, or remote disks accessed over network file systems such as NFS. It can also be used to provide information about terminal (TTY) input and output, and also includes some basic CPU information. Syntax and availability \`iostat -x\` displays output where each line (row) gives numerical data for one device. The first column lists the device name, and subsequent columns show various statistics for that device. Columns include the average service time (svc_t, which includes not only the time a request is in the service queue, but also the seek time and transfer time), the average busy percentage (%b, essentially the proportion of time that the device is in use), and the percentage of time that the queue is not empty (%w, which means the proportion of time in which requests from the device have not yet been fulfilled). It is best to run \`iostat\` specifying a time interval in seconds (for example \`iostat -x 30\`) in order to see the results over time. This is because otherwise, the output will reflect the values over the entire timespan since the system was last rebooted. The \`iostat\` tool is available on most Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as FreeBSD, macOS (com.apple.pkg.Core package), Linux (sysstat package), and Solaris. The syntax and output of \`iostat\` often differs slightly between them. Output of the command On a Solaris 10 system with numerous attached I/O devices Sun Microsystems stated that high values in the wait and svc_t fields suggest a lack of overall throughput in the system, indicating that \\"the system is overloaded with I/O operations\\". Consistently high values in the kr/s, kw/s, %w and %b fields also indicate \\"a possible I/O bottleneck\\". In versions of Solaris before Solaris 7, iostat can give misleading information in the wait field on multiprocessor systems. This is because iostat can misinterpret one processor being in a state where it is waiting for I/O, as meaning that all processors in the system are having to wait. It is also advisable to disregard high values in the svc_t field for disks that have very low rates of activity (less than 5%). This is because the fsflush process can force up the average service time when synchronising data on disk with what is in memory. iostat does not display information about the individual volumes on each disk if a volume manager is used . The vxstat command can be used to show this information instead. In contrast, when using Linux LVM as a volume manager, iostat does display volume information individually, because each logical volume has its own device mapper (dm) device.

They founded Tuscadero on Halloween of 1993 with bassist Phil Satlof and drummer Jack Hornady. The band took its name from Suzi Quatro's Happy Days character Leather Tuscadero. The band was signed with Mark Robinson of Teenbeat Records shortly after and released two EPs in the spring and summer of 1994: Mt. Pleasant and Angel in a Half Shirt. Their debut LP, The Pink Album, was released that fall, influenced by girl groups and the pop culture of its members' 1970s childhoods, such as board games and Nancy Drew. After touring with Sebadoh, the band signed with Elektra Records and re- recorded their debut album in 1995 with Mark Waterman, who had previously produced Elastica's debut. Tuscadero's second album, My Way or the Highway, was released in 1998, and they toured with Cheap Trick to promote it, but after the album's release, Elektra dropped the band. Farris later founded the band Dame Fate with bassist Yalan Papillon, releasing one album, Time and Tide Wait for No Man, in 2002.

Background Usher & Co window advertisement, Edinburgh Usher's father, whose name he shared, Andrew Usher (1782 ‚Äì 1855), was a prominent Scottish brewer who had experimented with the blending of whisky in the 1840s. He had two sons, Andrew II and John. Andrew Usher II was made a partner of Andrew Usher & Co of Edinburgh in the late 1840s. Andrew Usher II perfected the eventual blending of whisky and as such is sometimes called the 'father of Scottish whisky'. The subsequent blending and mass distillation enabled whisky to grow from a drink rarely consumed outside the United Kingdom, to be one of mass export. Andrew Usher II was one of the three founders of the North British Distillery; the other two were John Crabbie of Crabbie's Green Ginger and William Sanderson, whisky blender of Vat 69, who both served as directors of the NB distillery. Andrew Usher II was the first Chairman of the NB Distillery, serving from its start in 1885 until shortly before his death on 1 November 1898. Andrew Usher II and his brother John Usher, as partners in Andrew Usher & Co, were also the proprietors of the Edinburgh Distillery. Philanthropy Among his many bequests to Edinburgh and Scotland was Usher Hall, which became Scotland's premier concert hall. It is recorded that he donated ¬£100,000 to the city specifically to fund the new concert hall on 23 June 1896. A bust of Usher is located in the hall at the entrance to the Grand Circle. He died before the hall was completed and it was later opened by his widow. Usher also played a major role in improving the fishing village and harbour of St Abbs in Berwickshire. He purchased the Northfield estate on the edge of the village, enlarging and finishing the building of a countryside manor by the coastal shore in 1892. He considered the local public hall inadequate and subsequently funded a new village hall and school, which was constructed in 1887 and is now occupied by the St Abbs visitor centre. Usher also gave funds for the building of the local church in 1892 and the extension of the outer harbour wall in 1890. Death The grave of Andrew Usher, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh Usher is buried in the Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh with his first wife, Elizabeth Langmuir Miller (1826-1876); his second wife, Marion Blackwood Murray (1847-1925); and several of his children. Usher's city centre family house is now a converted pub (named the Pear Tree and Andrew Usher & Co) located near the University of Edinburgh.

One of these was under the pseudonym \\"Paul Ayres\\" (Dead Heat), and 30 were written using the name \\"Edward Ronns\\". He also wrote numerous stories for detective magazines such as Detective Story Magazine and Scarab. Among other works of fiction, Aarons is known for his spy thrillers, particularly his \\"Assignment\\" series, which are set all over the world and have been translated into 17 languages. The 42 novels in this series starred CIA agent Sam Durell. The first \\"Assignment\\" novel was written in 1955, and Aarons continued writing the series until up to his death. Early life Aarons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and earned a degree in Literature and History from Columbia University. He worked at various jobs to put himself through college, including jobs as a newspaper reporter and fisherman. In 1933, he won a short story contest as a student. In World War II he was in the United States Coast Guard, joining after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He finished his duty in 1945, having obtained the rank of Chief Petty Officer.  Assignment series  Fictional CIA agent Sam Durell is the protagonist for all of the stories in this series. Though the publisher listed these as the ‚ÄúAssignment series‚Äù, it is just as well known as the ‚ÄúSam Durell series\\". In later editions, the publisher also used ‚ÄúSam Durell‚Äù in the blurb immediately after the front cover - For example, Assignment Ceylon has ‚ÄúThis is number thirty-six of the famed Sam Durell novels--one of the bestselling suspense series in the history of publishing.‚Äù One consistent element is that all of the story titles started with the word ‚ÄúAssignment.‚Äù The stories were written over a span of 28 years, from 1955 to 1983. Each book set, more or less, in the time it was written. When initially issued the stories were not numbered and the publisher showed the list of available stories in the ‚ÄúAssignment‚Äù series in alphabetical order though often the alphabetical list did not include all of the previous stories. Later re-prints numbered the stories based the order in which they were first published though the list of stories just before the title page was still in alphabetical order. The list is shown in numbered/published order here. Each story is a standalone work and while they can be read in any order reading them in the order given here will provide some continuity as there are occasional references to people or incidents from previous assignments. The publications were inconsistent in their formatting of the title with many editions using five dots as in Assignment . . . . . Angelina on the title page though some used a dash, others used a colon, and a few break the title on two lines with no punctuation. The formatting on the front covers was also mixed with most editions breaking the title onto two lines though a few had two lines with the Assignment followed by a hyphen or colon.

Notable for its guitarless, piano-centric lineup, the band released a self-titled album in 1993 on spinART Records and a second album, We Get There When We Do on Warner Bros. Records in 1995. A third album, Comet, was recorded in 1996, but Warners subsequently dropped the band and the album was shelved. (It was released digitally in 2010.) Shortly thereafter, the group disbanded. In February 2019, the trio reunited for a performance at the Lancaster Roots & Blues Festival. Biography Siblings Jay and Beth Sorrentino began making music as kids in their Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home. Their father was a jazz drummer and their mother a vocalist. Beth took up piano, percussion and vocals, while Jay became a drummer. A high school friend, Ken Heitmueller, joined on bass and the trio formed Suddenly, Tammy!, recording two EPs, Spokesmodel and El Presidente, in a basement studio in the home of Ken's parents. Both EPs were well-received, especially by College Music Journal, who featured the trio on their cover in 1992. Beth Sorrentino's voice served as centerpiece for the band's tight arrangements. SpinART released the band's full-length debut in 1993. The self- titled album earned Suddenly, Tammy! a number of tour slots paired with major acts (e.g., Warren Zevon, Suede, Melissa Etheridge, Matthew Sweet, Jeff Buckley, Ben Folds Five, The Cranberries), and eventually got them signed to Warner Bros. in 1994. The band recorded with producer Warne Livesey (Midnight Oil; Julian Cope; Jesus Jones) and released We Get There When We Do in 1995, and an EP, Shut Up! It's Christmas. More polished and consistent than their debut, We Get There ... ranged from propulsive hard rock to ballads. The group completed a third album, Comet, in 1996. However, in what amounted to a \\"Christmas massacre,\\" Warners shed a number of bands from its artist roster in the final weeks of 1996, and Suddenly, Tammy! was dropped. Comet was shelved, and shortly thereafter, the trio disbanded. Singer/songwriter Beth Sorrentino subsequently released some solo recordings under her own name, and she continues to write and record new material.

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and transmits from a tower in the Westchester County Correctional Facility with an effective radiated power of 1,900 watts. History On April 8, 1960, WRNW got its start at 454 Main Street in Mount Kisco playing a mixture of light classical and easy listening music, and it went stereo in 1964. Founder and broadcast engineer Richard Burden was instrumental in the development of FM stereo broadcasting. By 1967, the station had moved to the second floor at 78 Lexington Avenue, and in June of that year, program director Don Bayley adopted an album rock format making WRNW one of the first FM stations in the New York City area to play rock music. (New York's WOR-FM went rock in 1966, but was hampered by an strike; WNEW-FM started their \\"Progressive Rock\\" format in October 1967.) In 1969, the station was sold to Lake Champlain Broadcasting Company, which shared owners with 105.9 WHBI in Newark. WRNW then played big band music during the day and sold block time from 10p.m.‚Äì2a.m. weekdays and all day weekends to clients shared with WHBI. According to WRNW's founder, the letters \\"RNW\\" stood for \\"Radio of Northern Westchester.\\" In 1971, WRNW changed to an easy listening format, and then to Top 40. In 1972, the station transitioned to a progressive rock format. On Monday, July 9, 1973, WRNW inaugurated transmissions from its new Briarcliff Manor studio on the second floor of a small house at 55 Woodside Avenue. The new transmitter was in Irvington, blanketing White Plains, Yonkers and lower Westchester. It was there, in 1976 that Howard Stern obtained his first paying radio job as a DJ and program director. Meg Griffin, later of WNEW-FM, WPIX, WXRK, WFUV, and Sirius Satellite Radio, was also music director of the station during the mid-70s. Ted Utz also began his professional career at the station in 1976 and went on to program and manage pioneering stations like WMMR in Philadelphia and WNEW FM. Earle Bailey (WLIR, WNEW-FM, WMMR Philadelphia, Sirius XM Radio's Deep Tracks) manned a shift at the station during the progressive rock era as did Doug Berman, now producer of National Public Radio programs Car Talk and Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!. In 1982, the station moved to an adult contemporary (AC) format, first known as Magic 107. It soon adopted the WZFM call letters and became known on-air as Z-107. The AC format was in place until 1991. WZFM was perhaps best known as the home of \\"The Saturday Night Special,\\" a freewheeling five-hour request 'n' contest good time oldies/comedy series which, over a nine-year run, became the station's highest-rated program. Co-hosts Gary Theroux and Kerin McCue also developed spinoff specials which were syndicated to other outlets, such as \\"The Halloween Spooktacular\\" and the 12-hour \\"Christmas Through The Years.\\" A three CD adaptation of the latter was released by Reader's Digest Records and ultimately sold over six million box sets. \\"The Saturday Night Special\\" remained on the air through a call letter change to WXPS The Express until the station was sold to new owners. In the early 90s, the new owners flipped the station to an alternative rock format as Today's Rock: X-107 with the WRGX call letters. On December 7, 1996, the station became part of the Big City Radio trimulcast (and eventual quadcast) with other 107.1 stations on Long Island, in northern New Jersey and, later, the Allentown/Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania area. WRGX and the other two multicast stations switched formats to country music as Y-107. WRGX became known as WWXY, and later adopted the call letters of former New York City country station WYNY. On May 9, 2002, after a day of stunting with construction noises, the quadcast adopted a Tropical music format branded Rumba 107.http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-020513.html The format was ill-suited to the quadcast suburban signals, and at the end of the year, Big City Radio filed for bankruptcy and sold the quadcast to Nassau Broadcasting. Nassau broke up the quadcast, leasing WYNY to Pamal Broadcasting under a Local marketing agreement (LMA). On April 3, 2003, at 3 p.m., 107.1 flipped to a simulcast of WSPK in Poughkeepsie, cobranded as \\"K104 and K107\\". The first song under the simulcast was \\"Ignition\\" by R. Kelly.WYNY Becomes K107.1 In 2004, Pamal ended the WSPK simulcast and debuted the adult album rock format WXPK has today as The Peak. Pamal completed the purchase of WXPK from Nassau at the end of 2004. Programming The Peak adopted the moniker ‚ÄúWorld Class Rock for New York‚Äôs Backyard‚Äù in April 2004. Staffed by veteran broadcasters from New York City and around the country, The Peak is the only commercial Triple A radio station in the New York City area. The Program Director is Chris Herrmann (WHJY, Providence; WCSX, Detroit; WBOS, Boston) who doubles as the midday host. \\"The Morning Peak\\" is the morning drive show, and is currently hosted by Chris \\"Coach\\" Rodriguez. Previously the morning slot was hosted by Caroline Corley (Sirius Satellite Radio; WLIR, Garden City; WYNY, New York.) until her death on November 25, 2013. Longtime New York radio personality Jimmy Fink (WHFS, Bethesda; WXRK, New York; WPLJ, New York) is the afternoon host. Weekends are branded as \\"The Weekend Peak\\". Current weekend lineup includes veteran broadcasters Pam Landry, Bruce Figler, and Dina Dessner. The Peak dedicates minimal airtime to syndicated programming; \\"Anything Anything\\" (hosted by Rich Russo) airs 9-10pm on Sunday. The Bluesmobile (hosted by Elwood Blues) previously aired 8pm on Sundays. The \\"Peak Performance Series\\" brings artists to what the station calls \\"the world‚Äôs most intimate performance venue,\\" the Acme Recording and Mastering studio in Mamaroneck, New York. Select members of the station's listener rewards program, The Peak Listener Advisory Board, are invited to attend. The sessions are recorded and played back on the air. The resulting tracks are exclusive to The Peak and are generally not available for purchase or download, although the station has released compilation albums. Like format leaders KBCO in Denver, Colorado and KFOG in San Francisco, The Peak airs a locally produced \\"10 at 10\\" weekdays at 10 am and 10 pm. The program features 10 songs from a single year peppered with snippets of popular movies, television shows, and commercials from that year. In 2006, the editors of Westchester Magazine named \\"The Peak‚Äôs 10 at 10 hosted by Rob Arrow\\" the Best Local Radio Show. In the annual \\"Best of Westchester\\" 2007 issue, readers voted The Peak best radio station. In 2008, Jimmy Fink was named \\"Best Radio Personality\\" by the readers of Westchester Magazine. In 2011, Caroline Corley was named \\"Best Radio Personality\\" by the readers of Westchester Magazine. Corley repeated as \\"Best Radio Broadcaster\\" winner again in 2013, largely due to her popular \\"Coffee With Caroline\\" promotion meeting up with numerous people in the community to share coffee. Caroline once again garnered the honor of \\"Best Radio Broadcaster\\" in 2014, a posthumous tribute to her legacy.

Demery (born 18 July 1949 in Detroit, Michigan) is a former Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He served during the Reagan administration. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of accepting a gratuity and obstruction of justice during his tenure in government. Business career  Between 1972 and 1978, Thomas Demery was chief operating officer of Bloomfield Management Co., a residents' property management company. After 1978, he worked as a licensed residential builder, real-estate broker, and mortgage correspondent. During the period 1982‚Äì1986, Demery served as a consultant to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for technical analyses and reviews of selected HUD multifamily mortgages. Career in government On August 11, 1986, during his second term in office, then-President Ronald Reagan, after the resignation of Maurice Lee Barksdale from that position, announced his intention to nominate Demery to be the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (H.U.D.), while Demery was the president of Income Property Services, Inc., a real estate brokerage firm in Birmingham, Michigan. =Loan scandal= On 17 June 1993, Thomas Demery, after being indicted on charges of lying to Congress and accepting a $100,000 loan from a Michigan developer whom he'd helped to get federal housing subsidies in the 1980s, pleaded guilty to accepting a gratuity from that developer, and of obstructing justice. Demery was accused of steering $15 million worth of H.U.D. loan subsidies to the developer who had given him a $100,000 second mortgage on \\"extremely favorable terms\\" that was \\"never publicly recorded,\\" as the indictment stated. Demery received a $50 fine on each count and was subject to a 2-year probation period. =Donations in exchange of HUD grants= In 1989, the Chicago Tribune reported that a charity which Demery had founded, \\"Food for Africa,\\" had received over $290,000 in donations from developers and consultants who were connected with HUD projects. The newspaper suggested these donations had been made in return for federal subsidies. A subsequent report issued by the department concluded that there was no direct link between the donations and the federal subsidies. The report led to a wider congressional investigation into alleged grant rigging in the Ronald Reagan Administration.  Personal life Mr. Demery comes from a family of Greek immigrants. He has two children from his 1971 marriage. He is a devout Christian and has been a Church Elder at the Bloomfield Hills Christian Church.

Sharp would later develop the neighborhood for 17 additional sections by building streets and installing utility lines, but left the home construction to other contractors. The first house, which served as a sales office, was built at the corner of Golf and Fisher Dr. Almost all of the first houses were sold to World War II veterans for $8,000-$10,000. One of the original homeowners, Ruth Metzger, bought her house in April 1947, when it was only a slab and still lived there through 2008.

As of 2011 Oak Forest has 5,480 houses. The original houses are 1950s style houses. In 2005 the median housing price per square foot was $104 ($ when adjusted for inflation). In 2010 it was $138 ($ when adjusted for inflation). As of 2011 housing prices for new houses range from $550,000 ($ considering inflation) to $700,000 ($ considering inflation), and housing prices for remodeled houses range from $200,000 ($ considering inflation) to $300,000 ($ considering inflation). As of 2011 many homeowners tore down the original houses to build new houses.

Industrial unions of railway workers, petroleum workers, and textile workers were strong enough on their own that they could function without CROM's support.Carr, Barry, \\"Industrial Labor: 1910-1940\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 688-89. It was founded in Saltillo in 1918 at a congress of labor delegates called by Mexican President Venustiano Carranza. The federation, of which Luis N. Morones was a major leader, marked a departure from the traditionally-anarchist stance of Mexican labor to a nationalist position. Luis N. Morones in 1925 Logo of the Laborist Party of Mexico From its inception, the CROM was controlled by a small group of union leaders, Grupo Acci√≥n (\\"Action Group\\") which supported the post-revolutionary Mexican government. After supporting President Carranza, who was overthrown in 1920, the CROM was a key base of support for two of his successors, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and Plutarco El√≠as Calles, two of the three Sonoran revolutionary generals who dominated Mexico in the 1920s. The political vehicle of the federation was the Mexican Laborist Party. Under Obreg√≥n, the labor movement was co-opted as its leaders were appointed to posts within the government. By the end of Obreg√≥n's term, labor had abandoned its goal of destroying capital in favor of establishing a balance between capital and labor that would benefit workers. Labor leaders defended the government's right, established in Article 123 of the Constitution of 1917, to arbitrate labor disputes, since they felt that their interests were represented in the government. Radical elements of the labor movement, horrified by the cooption, formed their own federation, the Confederaci√≥n General de Trabajadores (CGT), in 1921. The result of the split was disorientation within the movement, and workers became disillusioned with both the CROM and the CGT. Nonetheless, workers won some rights but gradually and threateninc neither the revolutionary government nor the growth of capitalism. In 1921, in a prelude to the Cristero War, the Mexican Catholic Church declared membership in the CROM a mortal sin. That proclamation failed to deter Mexicans from joining the federation or participating in its street demonstrations. Under Calles, the government gained even greater control over the CROM by its grip over Grupo Acci√≥n. The CROM essentially monopolized union membership, claiming over one million workers and five hundred organized peasants among its members. In reality, there were only about twenty thousand dues-paying members. Calles wielded influence over the CROM through Morones, whom he appointed the Minister of commerce and industry. By 1928, however, Calles had become distrustful of Morones, who had presidential ambitions. He was also wary of labor's socialist interpretation of the revolution. He broke the CROM's power by ordering the federal arbitrating bureaucracies to declare all CROM strikes illegal. The CROM's leadership had become so corrupt that it had lost its influence with the rank and file and was thus unable to organize action in its favor. Calles's successor, Emilio Portes Gil, began removing CROM officials from government positions. Vicente Lombardo Toledano, a dissident in the CROM, organized a faction called \\"Purified CROM\\" that left the federation in 1932, leaving the CROM to represent only a few unions in the textile industry. The Purified CROM became the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) in 1936, allying with the populist President L√°zaro C√°rdenas and the ruling Party of the Mexican Revolution. In the following years, the CTM eclipsed the CROM. The CROM continues to exist, and is the third largest labor federation in Mexico, supporting the PRD. References Further reading *Carr, Barry.

Deane Cate Rip Foster Rides the Gray Planet is a young adult science fiction novel written by Harold L. Goodwin under the pseudonym Blake Savage. The novel was originally published by Whitman in hardcover in 1952 and reprinted in the United Kingdom later in the same year as Rip Foster Rides the Grey Planet (note the spelling of \\"gray/grey\\"). There were two subsequent American reprints under different titles: another hardcover edition as Assignment in Space with Rip Foster in 1958 and a paperback edition as Rip Foster in Ride the Gray Planet, in 1969. Under all titles combined, there were approximately 100,000 copies of the novel printed. The first edition was illustrated by E. Deane Cate and the 1958 edition by Denny McMains. Goodwin is better known for other children's books he wrote, including the Rick Brant Science Adventure Series for Boys. According to Project Gutenberg , this novel is in the Public Domain in the United States.  Plot summary  Freshly graduated and commissioned Planeteer (the space-going equivalent of a Marine) Lt. Richard Ingalls Peter (\\"Rip\\") Foster, already contending with inter- service rivalry with the Space Force (equivalent to Navy) crewmen with whom he serves, is tasked with retrieving an asteroid made of pure thorium from the asteroid belt and bringing it to Earth for use as fissionable material. In this he is opposed by agents of the \\"Consolidation of Peoples Governments\\", who also seek control and use of the asteroid.  Political allegory  The villains in Rip Foster are known as \\"Consops\\", agents of the \\"Consolidation of Peoples Governments\\" that the Space Force and Planeteers of the \\"Federation of Free Governments\\" oppose. It is easy to see that the nickname \\"Connies\\" is reference to \\"Commies\\", an abbreviation of \\"Communists\\", given that the book was written during the Cold War and Korean War. The story emphasizes adventure, comedy, and narrow escapes from destruction, but hints at a geo- political situation not unlike that of the early 1950s. List of editions *Blake Savage.

The area's highest elevation is Pico Naiguat√°, at above sea level.  Culture & traditions  El √Åvila is known as \\"el pulm√≥n de la ciudad\\", the lungs of the city, since it serves many different functions for residents of Caracas, the most basic of these being navigation: the peak of El √Åvila marks the north of the city. It is home to the longest cable car ride in the world, as well as activities like running, biking, rock climbing, camping, and zip-lining. El Hotel Humboldt as well as many restaurants, including La Chivera, Casa Pakea, El Jard√≠n de Luna, Le Galipanier, Granja Natalia and Tarahumara, are all nestled in the mountain's hills. Every December, the \\"Cruz de Navidad\\" is illuminated, a large crucifix high up in the mountain that faces the city and can be seen from very far distances. = Legend of Pacheco = A common expression amongst Caracas city-dwellers to describe the change in seasons is \\"Pacheco has arrived,\\" which is a reference to the legend of Pacheco the flower-picker. He was known to be a resident of el Galip√°n, a region in el √Åvila close to the coast that tended to mark the border between the coast's chilly weather and that of the hot, dry weather of the rest of the country. El Galip√°n was home to some of the most beautiful, unique flowers in the country, and every December Pacheco would make the long trip down the mountain into the city to sell his harvest in the Plaza Bolivar in Caracas. His arrival was often accompanied by the cold December weather, and over time, the expression \\"Pacheco has arrived\\" came to mean that the weather is about to get colder. History El √Åvila was declared a park in 1958, fulfilling an interest in its protection that had been prevalent since the 19th century. With its creation came the protection of the forested mountains that surround Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. These mountains now serve as both a recreational area and as a buffer to pollution and urban expansion. El √Åvila has always been an important resource for the inhabitants of Caracas, who have used the area for a variety of activities, some of which have threatened its conservation. A hotel and a cable car, which climbs to the highest point at above sea level and drops down the other side to the city of Macuto, were opened in 1956. After being out of service for 20 years, this cable car was reopened in February 2002. Biodiversity This park has a high diversity of fauna and flora. More than 100 butterfly species, approximately 120 mammal species, 20 amphibians, 30 reptiles and 500 bird species (36% of Venezuela avifauna) have been documented. Nine bird species are endemic to Venezuela and three threatened bird species live in this park; one of the most coloured bird specimen in this park is the *querrequerre* (Cyanocorax yncas). In addition, more than 1,800 plant species from diverse taxonomic groups can be observed. Several of these plants are endemic to the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range with some endemic to the park itself. Vegetation The vegetation is of mountain forest, with variations that is distributed according to the height. Between sea level and 200 or 300 meters (and even higher up in the orientation of relief) is the xeric forest, where prevail species like cuj√≠ (Prosopis juliflora). Between 800‚Äì1500 m ombr√≥filo sub-evergreen forest is characterized by 2-3 arboreal strata and relatively dense undergrowth is located. Among the 1,200 - 3 tree storeys and undergrowth well developed - 2,200 masl ombr√≥filo evergreen forest with 2 stands. In these forests abundant species of the families of orchids, ferns, bromeliads, aroids, and have reported endemic species of the family Sapindaceae, Melastomataceae, Rubiaceae and Myrtaceae and arborescent ferns and palms (Ceroxylon ceriferum). These forests boast the only extant natural population of the critically endangered Venezuelan walnut tree (Juglans venezuelensis). Presents anthropogenic savannas where predominate species like melao capim (Melinis minutiflora), the bambusillo (Arthrostylidium venezuelae), yellow tara (Oyedaea verbesinoides) and incense (Espeletia neriifolia). In the upper regions of the Silla of Caracas and the Pico Naiguat√° is a characteristic vegetation of coastal bush subp√°ramo, consisting of open shrub of 1‚Äì3 m tall with a herbaceous relatively well developed, being the most characteristic species incense or frailej√≥n tree (Libanothamnus nerufolius), Spanish flag (Castilleja fissifolia) and false frailej√≥n (Liabum megacephalum). Panoramic view towards Caracas, looking at Pico Oriental; part of La Guaira can be seen to the left, and the Caracas valley to the right. Threats El √Åvila can be classified as vulnerable because there is a risk that the diverse threats it faces will increasingly erode its biodiversity unless in the near future constant monitoring occurs. The most immediate threats to the park, forest fires and illegal settlements, are located primarily near Caracas. However, the concentration of resources and vigilance in those areas closest to the city has resulted in more problems in the more isolated northern slope and eastern sector of El √Åvila. These areas suffer from a lack of signs, infrastructure and vigilance. Other threats include the presence of exotic plants, the Caracas Aerial Tramway, the Hotel Humboldt and poaching. Geography El √Åvila National Park is located along the central stretch of the Cordillera de la Costa, at 10¬∞ 32' latitude north and between 66¬∞ 12' and 67¬∞ 01' longitude west (see map). It covers the mountainous regions between the Caribbean Sea and the valleys of Caracas, Guatire, Guarenas and Barlovento. The park contains part of the following states: Vargas (northern slope), Capital District (southern and western slope) and Miranda (eastern slope). Humboldt Hotel, founded in 1956 on the top of the Cerro El √Åvila (2,105 m above the city of Caracas), Venezuela The National Park is named for the Cerro El √Åvila (Mountain El √Åvila), usually just referred to as \\"El √Åvila\\", which reaches above sea level. This mountain rises north of the capital Caracas located in a narrow valley above sea level and separates the city from the Caribbean Sea. The mountain is accessible by cable car (teleferico), by off-road vehicle, and on foot. In addition to the scenery, one may visit the hacienda, laboratory and mausoleum of Gottfried Knoche; a German-born doctor who was notorious for his experiments in mummification. They are accessible only by footpath. The park follows a mountain range long and approximately 16 km wide. It contains over , encompassing a wide variety of ecosystems that vary along the altitude gradient from above sea level at Naiguat√° peak. In the lower areas of the northern side, the vegetation is mainly xerophytes, represented by a variety of cacti, shrubs and spiny species. From , semi-deciduous forests dominate, whereas from the seasonal semi-deciduous forests are common. From above sea level on the northern slope and from on the southern slope, the forests are mainly sub-mountainous evergreen forests. Due to the constant condensation by the cooling of the air masses and the decrease of atmospheric pressure, cloud forest dominates between above sea level. Finally, the lack of water at and higher permits only sub-p√°ramo vegetation. Beautiful forests grow along the numerous watercourses that flow on either side of the mountain. The temperatures vary widely on El √Åvila, with an average temperature of in the lower sections of Caracas valley and on Naiguat√° peak, where the lowest temperature ever recorded was . The annual average rainfall fluctuates between and is influenced by orography, which explains why rain is more abundant on the northern slope where the mountain faces the trade winds.  Trails  There are plenty of trails in El √Åvila National Park for outdoor enthusiasts. From low-level routes to high technical complexity, there is a trail for everyone.

Actuarial present values are typically calculated for the benefit-payment or series of payments associated with life insurance and life annuities. The probability of a future payment is based on assumptions about the person's future mortality which is typically estimated using a life table.  Life insurance  Whole life insurance pays a pre-determined benefit either at or soon after the insured's death. The symbol (x) is used to denote \\"a life aged x\\" where x is a non-random parameter that is assumed to be greater than zero. The actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance issued to (x) is denoted by the symbol \\\\,A_x or \\\\,\\\\overline{A}_x in actuarial notation. Let G>0 (the \\"age at death\\") be the random variable that models the age at which an individual, such as (x), will die. And let T (the future lifetime random variable) be the time elapsed between age-x and whatever age (x) is at the time the benefit is paid (even though (x) is most likely dead at that time). Since T is a function of G and x we will write T=T(G,x). Finally, let Z be the present value random variable of a whole life insurance benefit of 1 payable at time T. Then: :\\\\,Z=v^T=(1+i)^{-T} = e^{-\\\\delta T} where i is the effective annual interest rate and Œ¥ is the equivalent force of interest. To determine the actuarial present value of the benefit we need to calculate the expected value \\\\,E(Z) of this random variable Z. Suppose the death benefit is payable at the end of year of death. Then T(G, x) := ceiling(G - x) is the number of \\"whole years\\" (rounded upwards) lived by (x) beyond age x, so that the actuarial present value of one unit of insurance is given by: :\\\\begin{align} A_x &= E[Z] = E[v^T] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{t=1}^\\\\infty v^{t} Pr[T = t] = \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty v^{t+1} Pr[T(G, x) = t+1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty v^{t+1} Pr[t < G - x \\\\leq t+1 \\\\mid G > x] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty v^{t+1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{Pr[G>x+t]}{Pr[G>x]}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{Pr[x+tx+t]}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty v^{t+1} {}_t p_x \\\\cdot q_{x+t} \\\\end{align} where {}_t p_x is the probability that (x) survives to age x+t, and \\\\,q_{x+t} is the probability that (x+t) dies within one year. If the benefit is payable at the moment of death, then T(G,x): = G - x and the actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance is calculated as :\\\\,\\\\overline{A}_x\\\\\\\\! = E[v^T] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty v^t f_T(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty v^t\\\\,_tp_x\\\\mu_{x+t}\\\\,dt, where f_T is the probability density function of T, \\\\,_tp_x is the probability of a life age x surviving to age x + t and \\\\mu_{x+t} denotes force of mortality at time x+t for a life aged x. The actuarial present value of one unit of an n-year term insurance policy payable at the moment of death can be found similarly by integrating from 0 to n. The actuarial present value of an n year pure endowment insurance benefit of 1 payable after n years if alive, can be found as :\\\\,_nE_x = Pr[G > x + n]v^n = \\\\,_np_xv^n In practice the information available about the random variable G (and in turn T) may be drawn from life tables, which give figures by year. For example, a three year term life insurance of $100,000 payable at the end of year of death has actuarial present value : 100,000 \\\\,A_{\\\\stackrel 1 x :{\\\\overline 3}} = 100,000 \\\\sum_{t=1}^{3} v^{t} Pr[T(G,x) = t] For example, suppose that there is a 90% chance of an individual surviving any given year (i.e. T has a geometric distribution with parameter p = 0.9 and the set {1, 2, 3, ...} for its support). Then :Pr[T(G,x)=1]=0.1, \\\\quad Pr[T(G,x)=2]=0.9(0.1)=0.09, \\\\quad Pr[T(G,x)=3]=0.9^2(0.1) = 0.081, and at interest rate 6% the actuarial present value of one unit of the three year term insurance is : \\\\,A_{\\\\stackrel 1 x :{\\\\overline 3}} = 0.1(1.06)^{-1} + 0.09(1.06)^{-2} + 0.081(1.06)^{-3} = 0.24244846, so the actuarial present value of the $100,000 insurance is $24,244.85. In practice the benefit may be payable at the end of a shorter period than a year, which requires an adjustment of the formula.  Life annuity  The actuarial present value of a life annuity of 1 per year paid continuously can be found in two ways: Aggregate payment technique (taking the expected value of the total present value): This is similar to the method for a life insurance policy. This time the random variable Y is the total present value random variable of an annuity of 1 per year, issued to a life aged x, paid continuously as long as the person is alive, and is given by: :Y=\\\\overline{a}_{\\\\overline{T(x)}} = \\\\frac{1-(1+i)^{-T}}{\\\\delta} = \\\\frac{1-v^T(x)}{\\\\delta}, where T=T(x) is the future lifetime random variable for a person age x. The expected value of Y is: :\\\\,\\\\overline{a}_x = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\overline{a}_{\\\\overline{t}} f_T(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\overline{a}_{\\\\overline{t}} \\\\,_tp_x\\\\mu_{x+t}\\\\,dt. Current payment technique (taking the total present value of the function of time representing the expected values of payments): :\\\\,\\\\overline{a}_x =\\\\int_0^\\\\infty v^{t} [1-F_T(t)]\\\\,dt= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty v^{t} \\\\,_tp_x\\\\,dt where F(t) is the cumulative distribution function of the random variable T. The equivalence follows also from integration by parts. In practice life annuities are not paid continuously. If the payments are made at the end of each period the actuarial present value is given by :a_x = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty v^t [1-F_T(t)] = \\\\sum_{t=1}^\\\\infty v^t \\\\,_tp_x. Keeping the total payment per year equal to 1, the longer the period, the smaller the present value is due to two effects: *The payments are made on average half a period later than in the continuous case. *There is no proportional payment for the time in the period of death, i.e. a \\"loss\\" of payment for on average half a period. Conversely, for contracts costing an equal lumpsum and having the same internal rate of return, the longer the period between payments, the larger the total payment per year.  Life assurance as a function of the life annuity  The APV of whole-life assurance can be derived from the APV of a whole-life annuity-due this way: :\\\\,A_x = 1-iv \\\\ddot{a}_x This is also commonly written as: :\\\\,A_x = 1-d \\\\ddot{a}_x In the continuous case, :\\\\,\\\\overline{A}_x = 1-\\\\delta \\\\overline{a}_x. In the case where the annuity and life assurance are not whole life, one should replace the assurance with an n-year endowment assurance (which can be expressed as the sum of an n-year term assurance and an n-year pure endowment), and the annuity with an n-year annuity due.

Emery was born in Los Angeles where her parents had gone in search of employment after being displaced from their home in Washington state by a crop failure. Emery grew up as a rancher's daughter in Montana after her parents moved there during her infancy (her father, Carl Harshbarger, had worked as chauffeur for Dorothy Lamour in Los Angeles for about two years, and had saved enough funds to buy some land there). Emery was a proponent of organic farming, the \\"back-to-the-land movement\\", and author of the Encyclopedia of Country Living. Emery opened the \\"School of Country Living\\" in Kendrick, Idaho in 1976, with her husband Mike Emery, to teach homesteading skills. The \\"School\\" was destroyed by a flash flood the next year, and could not successfully be reestablished. Mike and Carla divorced in 1985. Carla married constitutionalist legal scholar (with a special interest in Title 18, Oath of Office) Donald DeLong November 25, 2000 and moved to San Simon, Arizona. Carla self-published the first mimeographed edition of the Encyclopedia under the title An Old-Fashioned Recipe Book. Although she began intending to write a book, she published it in installments starting in 1970 as she wrote it, as if it were a newsletter. The first complete book was finished in March 1974. By the end of 1975 she had sold 13,000 copies. Around that time the book was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the \\"largest mimeographed volume in general circulation\\" (700 pages) and was listed as having sold the most copies of a self-published guide: 45,000 mimeographed copies as of 1977. The author believed that it might set a record for the most typographical errors in a book of its size, but reported that she did not have time to count them. In the mid-70's Emery made several television appearances, including on \\"The Mike Douglas Show\\", Johnny Carson's \\"Tonight Show\\" and \\"Good Morning, America\\", and even demonstrated goat-milking on \\"Donahue\\". Emery's book did not find a commercial publisher until the 7th edition when it was published by Bantam in 1977. The most recent edition of the Encyclopedia, the \\"updated 10th edition,\\" was published by Sasquatch Books in 2008. (). A new \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" was made available October 31, 2012, published by Sasquatch Books (). The Encyclopedia of Country Living presents an exhaustive overview of virtually every topic relevant to homesteading and self-sufficiency. During the 1990s Emery researched somnambulism, hypnosis, and mind control. Because of a personal history as a victim of hypnotism abuse, she wrote a second book, Secret, Don't Tell: The Encyclopedia of Hypnotism. By writing this, she hoped to help others who found themselves with the same distressful fate. It was difficult to find a publisher because the publishers feared possible repercussions from government entities. Don and Carla self-published this book in 1998, under Acorn Hill Publishing. (). The book criticized hypnosis in general, and what the author considered to be its unethical uses. Her widower, Don DeLong, now holds the copyrights to this book. Part I of Secret, Don't Tell contains four major case histories of criminal hypnosis which have been researched either by psychiatrists or investigative journalists. Each of those case histories is a clear-cut, well-studied, detailed case of hypnotic abuse - deceitful, amnesic, chronic, and damaging. Scattered throughout the book, many other significant cases involving criminal mind control are also described. On October 11, 2005, while on a speaking tour, Emery died in Odessa, Texas from complications of pneumonia. She was surrounded by all of her family.

Career Kent was a middle-order right-handed batsman. He scored 140 on his debut for Queensland in 1974‚Äì75 season followed by 76 in a Gillette Cup game. He found the going harder throughout the rest of the season, although he did manage 58 against Western Australia and 59 against South Australia. The following summer he scored 103 against South Australia and 101 against Victoria. =South Africa= Kent had frequently batted with Greg Chappell and received an offer to tour South Africa with an invitational XI, the International Wanderers. This side featured players like the Chappell brothers and Dennis Lillee ‚Äì Kent was the only member of the side who had not played international cricket. Kent married just before he left and honeymooned on the tour. Kent played well with scores of 55, 67 & 52 and 155. He ended up topping the International Wanderers aggregate and averages for the tour ‚Äì 398 runs at 56. Kent would have been on selectors minds at the beginning of the 1976‚Äì77 season but was unable to break through, despite 122 against the touring Pakistanis and 82 against South Australia. He was leapt over in the pecking order by Craig Serjeant, Kim Hughes and David Hookes, all of whom were chosen for the 1977 Ashes tour. =World Series Cricket= Opportunity did arise when Kerry Packer bought up most of the leading stars in 1977, but he chose World Series Cricket instead of staying with the traditional game. Ian Chappell had admired Kent's batting on the South Africa tour and offered him a place with the WSC squad. Kent's best innings for the WSC Australians include 40 in a low scoring game, 58 and 110. This earned him selection in the second supertest but he failed twice. He had better luck in the third supertest, with knocks of 43 and 40 helping Australia win the game. In the 5th supertest he scored a pair. The following summer Kent toured with the WSC Cavaliers XI. He endured a poor run of form until he scored 114 against the World XI and 55. He eventually got back in the Australian XI for some one day games with a top score of 62. He was back in the test side for the last supertest but failed twice. Kent toured the West Indies with the Australian XI. He played in the supertests, making 9 & 30 in the first, then hitting 109 in a one-day game for Australia. WSC West Indies v WSC Australia WSC Australia in West Indies 1978/79 (6th ODI) Venue Kensington Oval, Bridgetown on 7 March 1979 at CricketArchive For the second supertest he made 78, the third 7 and 45, 51 & 28, and 40 & 0. =Return to traditional cricket= Kent had a patchy 1979‚Äì80, not making a first class century, but enjoyed an excellent domestic 1980‚Äì81 season, scoring 941 runs at 58.81. Highlights included 77, 171 and 68 against Tasmania and 78 and 101 against South Australia. His knock of 41 in the McDonald's Cup Final, helping Queensland win the game, won him Man of the Match Award. Kent was selected in the Australian one day team towards the end of the summer, making scores of 12, 33 and 4. =1981 Ashes= Kent was chosen to tour England in 1981. Greg Chappell elected not to tour and Kim Hughes thought at the beginning that Kent was the most likely candidate to replace him at number three. However he failed during the early games and a score of 91 by Trevor Chappell saw him come into contention for the spot. Eventually Chappell was selected, with Kent relegated to 12th man. Kent was 12th man in the famous third test, which England won. He eventually hit form with 92 against Worcestershire (his previous high score had been 27). This earned him selection in the 4th test over Chappell, who was made 12th man. Kent turned out to be one of Australia's best performing batsmen in the second half of the tour, with a consistent string of scores. He made 171 runs, including a fifty as a makeshift opener at the Oval. He made 46 and 10 in the 4th test, 52 and 2 in the fifth and 54 and 7 in the 6th. =End of career= Kent began the 1981‚Äì82 season well with 92 for Qld against the touring Pakistan side. He was selected in the Australian team for the first test against Pakistan in 1981‚Äì82 over Graham Yallop and Dirk Wellham. A serious back injury cost him his place however, forcing him to withdraw. He withdrew from cricket for the season then in August 1982 retired altogether. In 64 first-class matches he scored a total of 3567 runs at 36.03 with a best of 171 against Tasmania. He was a fine slip catcher, taking 60 catches in all.

Later, some authorities placed it in the genus Ixos and then the genus Microscelis, before being re-classified to Hypsipetes in 2010. Alternate names for the brown-eared bulbul include the Asian brown-eared bulbul, chestnut-eared bulbul, and Eurasian brown-eared bulbul. = Subspecies = Twelve subspecies are currently recognized: * Japanese brown-eared bulbul (H. a. amaurotis) ‚Äì (Temminck, 1830): Also named the Japanese chestnut-eared bulbul.

While they prefer forested areas, they readily adapt to urban and rural environments, and their noisy squeaking calls are a familiar sound in most areas of Japan. Distribution and habitat The brown-eared bulbul is common in a very large range that includes the Russian Far East (including Sakhalin), northeastern China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, south to Taiwan and the Babuyan and Batanes island chains in the north of the Philippines. Historically, brown-eared bulbuls were migratory birds moving to the southern parts of its range in winter, but they have taken advantage of changes in crops and farming practices in recent decades to overwinter in areas farther north than previously possible. Most brown-eared bulbuls still move south in winter, often forming huge flocks during migration. They are considered agricultural pests in some areas of Japan where they may invade orchards and damage crops such as cabbages, cauliflowers and spinach. Behaviour =Breeding= Around five eggs are laid by females, who then incubate the egg. Brown-eared bulbuls are frequently parasitized by cuckoos, whose chicks will push bulbul eggs and chicks out of the nest. =Feeding= In summer, brown-eared bulbuls primarily feed on insects, while they mostly take fruits and seeds in the fall and winter.Brazil, Mark Noisy bulbuls change with the seasons March 8, 2016 Japan Times Retrieved 22 August 2016Japan Bird Research Association ‚Äì Brown-eared Bulbul Retrieved 22 August 2016 At this time, they also feed on the nectar from Camellia flowers, becoming dusted with yellow pollen in the process. In this way they help to pollinate the flowers at a time of year when there are few insect pollinators around. References Further reading * Gray, G. R.

The film is a remake/reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name and the ninth installment in the Halloween franchise. The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers, Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode, and Daeg Faerch as the young Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's \\"reimagining\\" follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing. Working from Carpenter's advice to \\"make [the film] his own\\", Zombie chose to develop the film as both an origin story and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. Despite mixed reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make, went on to gross $80.3 million worldwide in unadjusted U.S. dollars. Zombie followed the film with a sequel, Halloween II, in 2009. Plot On Halloween in Haddonfield, Illinois, having already exhibited signs of psychopathic tendencies, ten-year-old Michael Myers murders a school bully, his older sister Judith, her boyfriend Steve Haley and his mother's abusive boyfriend Ronnie White. Only his baby sister is spared. After one of the longest trials in the state's history, Michael is found guilty of first-degree murder and sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis. Michael initially cooperates with Loomis and his mother Deborah visits him regularly. Over the following year, Michael becomes dissociative, fixating on papier- m√¢ch√© masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even his mother. When Michael kills a nurse as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide. For the next fifteen years, Michael continues making his masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts to move forward with his life and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, killing the guards and hospital staff in the process. He then kills a truck driver for his clothes and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister. Laurie Strode and her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda Van Der Klok prepare for Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. Later that night, Lynda meets up with her boyfriend Bob Simms at Michael's abandoned home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, while Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, where he murders her parents Mason and Cynthia. Dr. Loomis, having been alerted of Michael's escape, arrives in Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn Sheriff Lee Brackett that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Loomis and Brackett head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is really Michael's baby sister, having been adopted by the Strodes following their mother's suicide. After convincing Laurie to babysit Lindsey Wallace while spending time with her boyfriend Paul, Annie is attacked by Michael after he kills Paul at the Wallace residence. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie badly injured on the floor but still alive, and calls for help. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle residence. Loomis and Brackett heard the call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence. Michael kidnaps Laurie and takes her back to their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, presenting a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael before escaping the house; Michael chases after her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him three times. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie and heads back to the house. Loomis intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes the gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie awakens on top of an unconscious Michael. Laurie aims the gun at Michael, with Michael's hand grabbing her wrist just as the gun is fired.

The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor. Bob Weinstein approached him about making the film. Zombie, who was a fan of the original Halloween, jumped at the chance to make a Halloween film for Dimension Studios. Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film. Carpenter's request was for Zombie to \\"make it his own\\". During a June 16, 2006 interview, Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, and insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film as opposed to mere rehashed material. The BBC reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed Halloween. The Myers house film location early March 2007 on Glendon Way in South Pasadena, California. Zombie's intention was to reinvent Michael Myers because he felt the character, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's backstory and add \\"new life\\" to the character. Michael's mask would be given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store as in the original film. Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, \\"[W]as he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?\\" Michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film, but while in Smith's Grove he stops talking completely. Zombie originally planned to have the adult Michael speak to Laurie in the film's finale, simply saying his childhood nickname for her, \\"Boo\\". Zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much, and because the act of Michael handing Laurie the photograph of them together was enough. Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield. The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was \\"showing up merely to say something dramatic\\". Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched). Production officially began on January 29, 2007. Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, \\"It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good\\". Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original Halloween. On December 19, 2006, Zombie announced to Bloody-Disgusting that Daeg Faerch would play the part of ten-year-old Michael Myers. On December 22, 2006, Malcolm McDowell was officially announced to be playing Dr. Loomis. McDowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in Loomis, who is out to get a new book from the ordeal. On December 24, 2006, Zombie announced that Tyler Mane, who had previously worked with Zombie on The Devil's Rejects, would portray the adult Michael Myers. Mane stated that it was very difficult to act only with his eyes. After winning the role, he noted that he consecutively watched seven of the eight Halloween films (excluding the third because Michael Myers does not appear) to better understand his character.EXCL: Tyler Mane on Halloween. ShockTillYouDrop.com (2007-08-05). Retrieved on 2013-03-30. Scout Taylor-Compton endured a long audition process, but as director Zombie explains, \\"Scout was my first choice. There was just something about her; she had a genuine quality. She didn't seem actor-y.\\" She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe, and Harris. A contest was held for a walk-on role in the film, at the time called Halloween 9; it was won by Heather Bowen. She played a news reporter who covered Michael's arrest, but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes. In the film's original ending, Loomis is successful in convincing Michael to let go of Laurie as he is surrounded by police officers, telling Michael he \\"did the right thing\\". Despite Loomis' protests, however, Michael is killed shortly afterwards in a hail of gunfire, and the film ends with Loomis looking down sadly at his former patient's corpse. Release Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, Hostel: Part II, to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene‚Äîthe rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates‚Äîwas replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films. Reception =Box office= On its opening day, Halloween grossed $10,896,610, and immediately surpassed the opening weekend grosses for Halloween II (1981) at $7,446,508, Season of the Witch (1982) at $6,333,259, The Return of Michael Myers (1988) at $6,831,250, The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) at $5,093,428, and The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) at $7,308,529. From September 1‚Äì2, Halloween earned $8,554,661 and $6,911,096, respectively, for a 3-day opening weekend total of $26,362,367. The film would earn an additional $4,229,392 on Labor Day for a 4-day holiday weekend gross of $30,591,759, making it the highest ever for that holiday. As a result, the 2007 film would immediately surpass the total box office gross for Halloween II (1981) at $25,533,818, Halloween III (1982) at $14,400,000, Halloween 4 (1988) at $17,768,757, Halloween 5 (1989) at $11,642,254, The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) at $15,116,634, and Halloween: Resurrection (2002) with $30,354,442. Following its first Friday after its opening weekend, Halloween saw a 71.6% drop in attendance, earning $3,093,679. The film, which earned the #1 spot at the box office in its opening weekend, earned only $9,513,770 in its second weekend‚Äîa 63.9% decrease‚Äîbut still claimed the #2 spot at the box office just behind 3:10 to Yuma. The film continued to appear in the weekend top ten going into its third weekend, when it earned $4,867,522 to take sixth place. It was not until the film's fourth weekend that it fell out of the top ten and into twelfth place with $2,189,266. Halloween would fail to regain a top ten spot at the box office for the remainder of its theatrical run. Thanks to its opening weekend of $30.5 million, the film broke the box-office record for the Labor Day weekend, surpassing the record set in 2005 by Transporter 2 with $20.1 million. It still currently resides as the top Labor Day weekend grosser. Halloween was also the 8th highest-grossing R-rated film of 2007, and finished out the year in 44th place for domestic box office gross. With its $58 million box office gross, Halloween was the second highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, taken over by A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) with $63 million. However, it is third in the list which consists of When a Stranger Calls (2006) at $47.8 million, Black Christmas (2006) at $16.3 million, Prom Night (2008) at $43.8 million, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009) with $51.4 million, and Friday the 13th (2009) leading the group with $60 million. Halloween is also ranked eleventh overall when comparing it to all of the horror remakes, as well as eighth place for all slasher films in general, in unadjusted dollars. In addition to the film's North American box office, it opened alongside Michael Clayton and Mr. Woodcock in foreign markets on the weekend of September 29, 2007. Halloween led the trio with a total of $1.3 million in 372 theaters ‚Äì Michael Clayton and Mr. Woodcock took in $1.2 million from 295 screens and $1 million from 238 screens, respectively. By November 1, 2007, Halloween had taken in an additional $7 million in foreign markets. Ultimately, the film would earn approximately $21,981,879 overseas. By the end of the film's theatrical run, the film had taken a worldwide total of $80,253,908. When adjusting for the 2018 inflation, Zombie's Halloween‚Äîwhich adjusts to $77.4 million domestically‚Äîis sixth, behind Carpenter's Halloween at $183.6 million, Halloween (2018) at $155.7 million, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later at $107.3 million, and Halloween II at $84 million. =Critical response= Based on 117 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, Halloween received a 26% approval rating, with the consensus \\"Rob Zombie doesn't bring many new ideas to the table in Halloween, making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise.\\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a 47 out of 100 from the 18 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale; it also reported that 62% of the audience was male, with 57% being 25 years or older. Various critics thought that Malcolm McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis. Peter Hartlaub, of the San Francisco Chronicle, felt Zombie was successful in both \\"[putting] his own spin on Halloween, while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter's film\\"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost \\"sympathetic\\" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with Halloween slipping into \\"slasher-film logic\\". Nathan Lee of The Village Voice disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that Halloween may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it succeeded in \\"[deepening] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear\\". The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half. In short, Turner stated that performances from the cast were \\"superb\\", with Malcolm McDowell being perfectly cast as Dr. Loomis, but that the film lacked the scare value of Carpenter's original. Jamie Russell from the BBC agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half; she stated that Zombie's expanded backstory on Michael was \\"surprisingly effective\\"‚Äîalso agreeing that McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis‚Äîbut that Zombie failed to deliver the \\"supernatural dread\\" that Carpenter created for Michael in his 1978 original. New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks‚Äîfocusing more on enhancing the \\"imagery of violence\\"‚Äîthan real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five. Dennis Harvey, from Variety magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. In contrast, Rossiter Drake of The Examiner applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a \\"compelling take on the mythology\\" that managed to be \\"unique\\" and \\"shocking\\" at the same time. In agreement with other critics, Empire magazine's Kim Newman felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film \\"[fell] flat\\" when it came to delivering suspense or anything \\"remotely scary\\"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the \\"dogged psychiatrist\\". Ben Walter, of Time Out London, felt Zombie added \\"surprising realism\\" to the development of Michael Myers‚Äô psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film's \\"suspense and playfulness\\" with a convincing display of \\"black-blooded brutality\\". Frank Scheck, of The Hollywood Reporter, believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so \\"brilliant\\", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guides Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a \\"scary horror movie\\", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's \\"savage, greasy-haired '70s\\" films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent \\"torture porn\\" horror films. Bill Gibron of PopMatters believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield‚Äîwith Michael acting as a true \\"boogeyman\\"‚ÄîZombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his \\"desire for death\\". Halloween won the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award for Best Film of 2007, drawing in 550 votes, the most ever in the history of the award. The film also won the 'Best Remake Award' at the 2008 Spike TV Scream Awards. Dan Mathews, vice president of PETA, sent Rob Zombie a thank- you letter for what he perceived as Zombie sending a message to audiences when he depicted the young Michael Myers torturing animals, something he felt demonstrated that people who commit acts of cruelty to animals are likely to move on to humans. Mathews went on to say, \\"Hopefully, with the attention focused by your movie on the link between cruelty to animals and human violence, more people will recognize the warning signs among people they know and deal with them more forcefully. We wish you continued success!\\" Carpenter himself was ambivalent about the film; during an audience Q&A; in 2016, Carpenter stated that he took issue with Zombie's comments that he was \\"cold\\" when they discussed the project and noted that it will color his perception of the film, and lamented that giving Myers a backstory took away from the mystique. He later clarified that he is on good terms with Zombie. Carpenter, serving as an executive producer and creative consultant for the 2018 sequel to Halloween (1978), expressed his disagreement with Zombie's portrayal of Myers, \\"I thought that he took away the mystique of the story by explaining too much about [Michael Myers]. I don't care about that. He's supposed to be a force of nature. He's supposed to be almost supernatural.\\" =Awards and nominations= The film was nominated for multiple awards for best film and acting. Halloween was nominated by the Sitges Film Festival for \\"Best Film\\", as did the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards, for which it won. Sheri Moon Zombie was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Fright Meter Awards. Home media The film's soundtrack was released on August 21, 2007; it includes 24 tracks, consisting of 12 dialogue tracks and 12 instrumentals. The album contained both new tracks, as well as ones recycled from the original Halloween and its sequel. Tyler Bates' interpretation of John Carpenter's original Halloween theme is the first musical track, with \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper,\\" which appeared in the original Halloween, and \\"Mr. Sandman\\", which appeared in Halloween II and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, performed by Nan Vernon. Writing about its selection from the 1981 film, one reviewer for the BBC commented that it worked well to \\"mimic Laurie‚Äôs situation (sleeping a lot)\\", making \\"the once innocent sounding lyrics seem threatening in a horror film\\". The album also includes Kiss's \\"God of Thunder\\", Rush's \\"Tom Sawyer\\", Alice Cooper's \\"Only Women Bleed\\", Peter Frampton's \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\", Nazareth's \\"Love Hurts\\", Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive's \\"Let It Ride\\", Misfits' \\"Halloween II\\", and an Iggy Pop live version of The Stooges' \\"1969\\" among others. On December 18, 2007, the film was released on DVD in the United States; both the theatrical (110 minutes) and an unrated director's cut (121 minutes) were released as two-disc special editions containing identical bonus features. The film was released on DVD in the UK on April 28, 2008, known as the \\"Uncut\\" edition. On October 7, 2008, a three-disc set was released. This Collector's Edition of Halloween features the same bonus features as the previous unrated edition, but includes Zombie's four-and-a-half-hour \\"making-of\\" documentary similar to the \\"30 Days in Hell\\" documentary for Zombie's The Devil's Rejects.

The World Publishing Company) All Men Are Mortal () is a 1946 novel by Simone de Beauvoir. It tells the story of Raimon Fosca, a man cursed to live forever. The first American edition of this work was published by The World Publishing Company. Cleveland and New York, 1955. It was adapted into a 1995 film of the same name. Plot Regina is a young theatrical actress. Her career seems to be promising and her reputation becomes wider with every tour and performance. But she is not content. The sparks of attention in the eyes of her audience seem fleeting and the praises seem typical rather than unique. She can not accept herself sharing their attention and regards with her co- star Florence. Following a performance in Rouen, Regina chooses to stand aside from her theatrical troupe and starts an internal monologue concerning her uniqueness, or lack thereof, among other women. She keeps comparing herself to Florence and focusing on the current love life of her fellow actress. She bitterly acknowledges that Florence is probably not thinking about her and neither are the other people around her. Then she notices another man who seems to pay little attention to her, Raymond Fosca. Fosca is described as a reasonably attractive with a crooked nose, tall and athletic, seemingly young but with a passionless face and empty eyes that remind Regina of her father in his deathbed. Soon enough Regina finds that Fosca resides in the same hotel as her theatrical troupe. He has piqued the curiosity of the staff and several visitors for his peculiar habits. He had been staying in the hotel for a month but hardly spoke to anybody and appeared deaf to any attempts to speak to him. He spent his days in the garden, sitting in silence even in rain. He never changed clothes and no one had seen him eat anything. A curious Regina enters his room in his absence and finds release papers from an asylum, claiming the man suffered from amnesia and was incarcerated for an unknown amount of time. He was considered harmless and released a month before. She decides to use the information to approach Raymond Fosca. However Fosca is not in the mood for conversations. Regina asks him for a way to escape her boredom. He only asks how old the actress is. He takes her report of being twenty-eight-years-old and estimates she has about fifty more years to endure. Then she would be free of boredom. Despite his warnings to stay away from him, Regina makes a habit of visiting him. Fosca comments that due to her time has started flowing for him again. Already the man leaves the hotel for the first time in a month to satisfy a new craving for cigarettes. He starts confiding in her and explains that he has no amnesia. Far from it, he remembers everything from his life. Even his thirty years in the asylum. Regina visits the man daily but then tires of him. The theatre company leaves Rouen and she leaves Fosca without a word. She returns to Paris and starts negotiations for a career in the Cinema of France. But only three days later, Fosca has followed her home. She is the only person to currently hold his interest and makes clear his intention to keep following her. He wants to watch and listen to her before she dies. Regina mocks Fosca at first for stalking her, and then worries about his surprising resolve at following her, despite her attempts to get rid of him. Their discussions soon turn to her passion for life and her mortality, while Fosca first hints at his own immortality. She finds it fascinating that a man does not fear death even if the man seems to suffer from his own brand of insanity. Regina contemplates his state of mind and even starts discussing it with the other persons in her life. Fosca soon enough proves his immortality by cutting his own throat with a razor in her presence. At first a stream of blood flows from his throat and the man seems to be dying. But moments later the flow stops, the wound starts closing without treatment and Fosca heals at an incredible rate. He seeks a new start for himself, to feel alive again by her side. Regina is touched, but has another motive to return his affection. In ten thousand years, she thinks, Fosca could still be alive remembering her, long after her own death. Another suitor comments that she would be one memory among many, one butterfly in a collection. But Regina pursues her new immortal lover and even enjoys tutoring him at living again. However she finds herself unable to understand him and his indifferent behavior to many aspects of modern life. Seeking to understand him, Regina demands to listen to his own life story which presumably shaped his perceptions. Fosca has to agree and his narration begins. Fosca was born in a palace of the fictional Carmona, Italy on 17 May 1279. His mother died shortly after his birth. He was raised by his father and trained in equestrianism and archery. A monk was hired to indoctrinate the boy to the beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church but Fosca proudly proclaims never caring for anything beyond this Earth and never fearing God or man. He idolized his handsome and strong father and resented that Carmona was instead governed by Francois Rienchi. He was bow-legged and fearful for his own life. The people hated Rienchi and the Duke of Carmona was said to not make a step without his chainmail armor and at least ten guards. Fosca describes him being greedy and having his private chest of gold, kept full by unpopular methods. One by one the nobles of Carmona were accused of treason and executed by hanging or decapitation. Their fortunes were confiscated and provided more gold for Rienchi, as did the heavy taxation of the lower classes. Many lived in hovels and people begging for money and food were commonplace. Fosca considered Francois Rienchi responsible for the misery of Carmona. But Francois eventually died, succeeded by his own brother Bertrand Rienchi. Rumor had it that Bertrand had poisoned his brother but Carmona celebrated the change of Dukes. But the chest of gold was always empty and Bertrand had to fill it by following in the footsteps of his brother. He had promised no more public executions but now the nobles and wealthy traders of Carmona withered away in prison. Their fortunes were still confiscated and heavier taxes were added to the old ones. The people now hated Bertrand Rienchi. The main tension exists between the meaningless of daily life, rituals, style from the perspective of an immortal man contrasted by the seeming trivial concerns of a mortal woman: the importance and the value they put on things are at opposite ends of the spectrum. From his perspective everything is essentially the same. From her perspective even the most trivial is unique and carries significance.

In 1989, she began her studies at the Columbus School of Law (CUA Law) The Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C. where she earned her J.D. in 1992. 109th Congress 1st Session Early career According to statements at her May 12, 2005 AAG nomination hearing, Fisher graduated from law school in 1992 and then worked for \\"several years as an associate at Sullivan and Cromwell\\". Her clients included \\"corporations in civil litigation\\". She also represented an inmate on death row in a \\"habeas corpus appeal\\". 109th Congress 1st Session From 2001 to 2003, during the tenure of Michael Chertoff‚Äîthen-United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division‚Äîwho became her \\"longtime\\" mentor,Leahy said Fisher was Chertoff's \\"long-time prot√©g√©\\". Fisher was Deputy United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. }} By 2005 she had become a partner in Latham & Watkins in Washington, D.C.. Latham & Watkins By 2005, Fisher was a partner at the law firm of Latham & Watkins in Washington, D.C.. Fisher specializes in \\"white collar criminal investigations, internal investigations and advising clients on a range of criminal matters\\", including: international criminal matters relating to alleged bribery under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar foreign laws; economic sanction and export control issues; and criminal matters such as healthcare fraud, accounting and securities fraud and procurement fraud. Fisher previously served as global co-chair of the firm's white-collar and government investigations practice group. Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Fisher with Dick Cheney in 2003 From 2001 to 2003, Fisher was Deputy United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. Fisher served as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice (DOJ) for three years‚Äîfrom 2005 until she resigned on May 23, 2008, She served as an Assistant Attorney General during President George W. Bush's second term. She was initially appointed in a recess appointment on August 31, 2005, to head the Criminal Division in the Department of Justice. Fisher was confirmed by the Senate on September 19, 2006 in a 61‚Äì35 vote. =Nomination, hearing and confirmation= Fisher was nominated on March 29, 2005, and her nomination was sent to the Senate April 4, 2005. Her nomination was stalled by Michigan Senator Carl Levin over his inquiry into interrogation tactics at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval facility. She was confirmed by the senate on September 19, 2006. According to an August 15, 2005 The New York Times article by Eric Lichtblau, Senate Democrats blocked Fisher's confirmation for months because a critical post now vacant for about four months because of concerns over her \\"possible role in overseeing detention policies at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba\\". Fisher and the Justice Department say she never took part in such meetings,\\" According to the Times article, Senator Arlen Specter said \\"in the interview on Friday [August 12, 2005,] that he had concerns about the depth of criminal prosecution experience at the top of the Justice Department after the departure of\\" Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, who left in August 2005 to be Lockheed Martin's new general counsel. Comey had been \\"a veteran prosecutor in Manhattan...Judiciary Committee members said that for the first time in memory, none of the most senior officials at the Justice Department\\"‚ÄîAttorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Timothy E. Flanigan, Robert D. McCallum, Jr., or Alice Fisher \\"would have experience as a criminal prosecutor.\\" =Tenure= One of Fisher's first major investigations at the DOJ was the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal which dealt with congressional corruption. In January 2006, Fisher announced a deal in which Abramoff, a Republican lobbyist, pleaded guilty to three felonies, including conspiracy to bribe public officials, in return for Abramoff's cooperation in the wide-ranging investigation into congressional corruption. In Florida in 2008, during the tenure of Fisher as AAG, then U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta‚Äîwho was federal prosecutor in Florida at that time‚Äîhandled the \\"sex crimes case\\" of the multimillionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein who had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution. The lawyers for Epstein's unsuccessfully lobbied Fisher and other DOJ officials to stop the sex crimes prosecution. Epstein's lawyer Ken Starr later sent Fisher a letter appealing the U.S. Attorney's stated intention to notify the victims of an appending plea deal. Starr suggested this appeal was instrumental in stopping the notifications. Fisher said her office did not make any decisions related to victim notification, a decision ultimately made by U.S. Attorney's office. According to the Washington Post, Fisher's signature initiatives during her tenure included \\"a crackdown on corporate bribes and a new strategy to attack international organized crime.\\" Speaking and publications Fisher has published articles and spoken on criminal law topics such as the Criminalization of Corporate Conduct, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, government investigations, other international compliance issues and the legal industry.

The pipeline was to lessen European dependence on Russian energy. The project was backed by several European Union states and the United States and was seen as rival to the Gazprom-Eni South Stream pipeline project. The main supplier was to be Iraq with potential supplies from Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Egypt. The project was developed by a consortium of six companies. Preparations started in 2002 and the intergovernmental agreement between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria was signed on 13 July 2009. After an announcement of the construction of TANAP, the consortium submitted the Nabucco-West project, which was to run from the Turkish- Bulgarian border to Austria. It was a modification of the original Nabucco Pipeline project. The main supply for the Nabucco West was to be Shah Deniz gas through the proposed Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP). After Shah Deniz consortium decision to prefer the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline over Nabucco, the Nabucco pipeline plan was finally aborted in June 2013. Motivation The Nabucco project was backed by the European Union and the United States. In the Trans-European Networks - Energy (TEN - E) programme, the Nabucco pipeline is designated as a project of strategic importance. An objective of the project is to connect the European Union better to the natural gas sources in the Caspian Sea and the Middle East regions. The project has been driven by the intention to diversify its current energy supplies, and to lessen European dependence on Russian energy‚Äîthe biggest supplier of gas to Europe. The Russia‚ÄìUkraine gas disputes have been one of the factors driving the search for alternative suppliers, sources, and routes. Moreover, as per the European Commission, Europe's gas consumption is expected to increase from 502 billion cubic meters, in 2005, to 815 billion cubic meters in 2030, which would mean Russia alone would not be able to meet the demand. South Eastern Europe is important as many of the regions are heavily dependent on Russian gas imports. Nabucco aims to diversify the gas supply to increase competition and security. Simon Pirani, senior research fellow, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies presented to delegates at the Ukrainian Energy Forum in 2013 a list of prices from the Russian newspaper Izvestia: \\"What they show is the prices at which Russian gas is being purchased in different European countries, and this tells quite a simple story. If you're in Eastern Europe, and you are quite heavily dependent on Russian gas, you pay more than $500/TCM; if you're in the UK, where we have a pretty much complete domination of gas-to-gas market, you pay $300, or $370+ in Germany, which is somewhere in between.\\" History Preparations for the Nabucco project started in February 2002 when first talks took place between Austrian OMV and Turkish BOTA≈û. In June 2002, five companies (OMV of Austria, MOL Group of Hungary, Bulgargaz of Bulgaria, Transgaz of Romania and BOTA≈û of Turkey) signed a protocol of intention to construct the Nabucco pipeline. The protocol followed by the cooperation agreement in October 2002. The name Nabucco comes from the same famous opera of Giuseppe Verdi, that the five partners had listened to at the Vienna State Opera after this meeting. In December 2003, the European Commission awarded a grant in the amount of 50% of the estimated total eligible cost of the feasibility study including market analysis, and technical, economic and financial studies. On 28 June 2005, the joint venture agreement was signed by five Nabucco partners. The ministerial statement on the Nabucco pipeline was signed on 26 June 2006 in Vienna. On 12 September 2007, Jozias van Aartsen was nominated by the European Commission as the Nabucco project coordinator. In February 2008, German RWE became a shareholder of the consortium. On 11 June 2008, the first contract to supply gas from Azerbaijan through the Nabucco pipeline to Bulgaria was signed. The President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev confirmed on 29 January 2009, that Azerbaijan was planning to at least double its gas production in the coming five years to supply the pipeline. On 12 April 2009, the Minister of Energy of Turkey Hilmi G√ºler confirmed that Turkey is ready to sign a deal, provided that Turkey gets 15% of the natural gas to be carried through the Nabucco pipeline. On 27 January 2009, the Nabucco Summit held in Budapest. On 24‚Äì25 April 2009, the Nabucco pipeline was discussed, among other energy issues, at the high-level energy summit in Sofia, and on 8 May 2009, at the Southern Corridor Summit in Prague. The intergovernmental agreement between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria was signed by five prime ministers on 13 July 2009 in Ankara. The European Union was represented at the ceremony by the President Jose Manuel Barroso and the Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs, and the United States was represented by Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy Richard Morningstar and Ranking Member of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Senator Richard Lugar. Hungary ratified the agreement on 20 October 2009. Bulgaria ratified the agreement on 3 February 2010. Romania ratified the agreement on 16 February 2010. Turkey became the final country ratifying the agreement on 4 March 2010. The legal framework set up by the intergovernmental agreement was strengthened further with the signing in 2011 of the Project Support Agreements (PSAs) between Nabucco and each of the Transit countries. The main elements of the PSAs are the affirmation of an advantageous regulatory transit regime under EU law; the protection of the Nabucco Pipeline from potential discriminatory changes in the law; and support for legislative and administrative actions for the further implementation of the project. In May 2012, the Nabucco consortium submitted a Nabucco-West proposal to the Shah Deniz consortium. On 10 January 2013, Nabucco International and Shah Deniz partners signed a funding agreement. According to the agreement, Shah Deniz partners will take a 50% stake in the project if chosen as an export route for the Shah Deniz gas. On 3 March 2013, Nabucco International signed a memorandum of understanding with the TANAP consortium. However, on 28 June 2013 Shah Deniz consortium announced that it had chosen the Trans Adriatic Pipeline over Nabucco for its gas exports, prompting OMV CEO Gerhard Roiss to regard the Nabucco project as \\"over\\". Route The original long pipeline was to run from Ahiboz in Turkey via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary to Baumgarten an der March, a major natural gas hub in Austria. In Ahiboz, it would be joined with two feeder lines, one connecting to Georgia in the north (South Caucasus Pipeline), and the other connecting to Iraq (pipeline to be built) in the southeast. It would be fed also from the Tabriz‚ÄìAnkara pipeline. of the pipeline was to be laid in Turkey, in Bulgaria, in Romania, in Hungary, and in Austria. The modified Nabucco West was to start from the Turkey‚ÄìBulgaria border and further to follow the original route. The total length of Nabucco West is , with the following distances in each of the below countries: * Bulgaria: * Romania: * Hungary: * Austria: From Turkey, the original Nabucco pipeline was proposed to enter Bulgaria and after running in parallel to the existing gas system connect to the Bulgarian national gas network at the compressor station of village Lozenets in Yambol Province. After crossing the Balkan Range, the pipeline will head in a northwesterly direction. After reaching the national northern half-ring, it will run in parallel to the existing east‚Äìwest gas line and continue to northwest before reaching the Danube at Oryahovo. In Bulgaria, Nabucco will have interconnections with the national gas network and will have two off-take systems, compressor stations and pig stations. In Romania, the pipeline would be crossing into the country under the Danube. The route on the Romanian territory would go from south-west to north-west, its south-western starting point being located at the Danube- crossing point upstream the Port of Bechet, and the north-western end point being located north of NƒÉdlac. The pipe would follow the south western border of Romania and will travel through the counties of Dolj, Mehedinti, Caras- Severin, Timi»ô, and Arad. The pipeline would cross 11 protected sites, two national parks, three natural reserves, and 57 watercourses, namely major rivers such as: Jiu, Co≈üu≈ütea, Cerna, Bela Reca, Timi»ô, Bega, and Mure≈ü, as well as their tributaries. The terrain is rockier in Romania and mainly composed of limestone. This section is long. Polish gas company PGNiG was studying the possibility of building a link from the Nabucco gas pipeline to Poland. Technical features The Nabucco-West was to be exempt from regulated third party access, including tariff regulation, for 25 years. Its proposal stated a capacity of per year. This capacity will be scaled up to to compensate for an anticipated increase in demand. Nabucco West would offer 50% of its transport capacity to third parties outside of the shareholders. Construction The Nabucco project was included in the EU Trans-European Energy Network programme and a feasibility study for the Nabucco pipeline had been performed under an EU project grant. The front end engineering and design (FEED) services of the pipeline, including the overall management of the local FEED contractors, the review of the technical feasibility study, route confirmation, preparation of the design basis, hydraulic studies, overall SCADA and telecommunications, GIS and preparation of tender packages for the next phase, was managed by UK-based consultancy Penspen. Starting from 14 December 2011, WorleyParsons was appointed as on owner's engineer. On 28 January 2013, it was announced that a re-feed for the Nabucco West project was being conducted by Saipem following the selection of the project as the Central European route by the Shah Deniz consortium in June last year. This work will build upon existing engineering work already completed for the Nabucco classic route. According to Reinhard Mitschek, managing director of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, construction of the pipeline was scheduled to begin in 2013 and would become operational by 2017. However, in June 2013, the Shah Deniz Consortium had chosen a rival project, Trans Adriatic Pipeline, that has a route Turkey‚ÄìGreece-Albania-Italy, and the future of Nabucco project is unclear. Financing The pipelines costs are undisclosed, however Reinhard Mitschek said in late 2012 that the costs of Nabucco West would be far lower than ‚Ç¨7.9 billion previously suggested. The final investment decision was expected in 2013. The sources of financing of the Nabucco project are not decided yet. As a commercial project, it will be financed 30% by the project's partners and the rest by commercial financial instruments. The European Commission has awarded an EU project grant in the amount of 50% of the estimated total eligible cost of the feasibility study and has also decided to allocate ‚Ç¨200 million from the European Economic Recovery Plan. To receive this financing, this grant should be committed by the end 2010. At the Nabucco Summit held in Budapest on 27 January 2009, the heads of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) confirmed, that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the project. On 5 February 2010, the EIB vice- president Mathias Kollatz-Ahnensaid that Nabucco consortium was seeking up to ‚Ç¨2 billion (20‚Äì25% of costs) in bank financing. The EIB was ready to participate in the financing of this project; however, the precondition was that the partner countries should legally approve the pipeline's transit in their countries. In September 2010, the consortium signed an agreement with EIB, EBRD, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), according to which the banks will conduct due diligence for a financing package of ‚Ç¨4 billion. Up to ‚Ç¨2 billion will be signed by the EIB, up to ‚Ç¨1.2 billion by the EBRD, and up to ‚Ç¨800 million by the IFC. All figures listed above relate to the original Nabucco Project. Updated figures for Nabucco West are undisclosed as of June 2013. Reinhard Mitschek, Managing Director of Nabucco said in an interview with Natural Gas Europe in May 2013 that \\"Nabucco is continuing to cooperate with the International Financial Institutions to ensure the bankability of the project, a large part of the legal due diligence has already been completed. A Letter of Intent has been signed with the IFIs most recently\\". In a separate interview in February 2013, Mitschek confirmed that all legal and regulatory framework approved for the original Nabucco project would remain valid for Nabucco West. Supply sources The potential suppliers for original Nabucco project were considered to be Iraq, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Egypt. At the first stage, of natural gas per year were expected from Iraq. Iraqi gas would be imported via the Arab Gas Pipeline (extension to be built) from the Ekas field. Turkmenistan would provide of gas per year through Iran or across the Caspian Sea via the planned Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline. OMV and RWE set up a joint venture, named the Caspian Energy Company, to carry out research for a gas pipeline across the Caspian Sea. In the long term, Kazakhstan may become a supplier providing natural gas from the Northern Caspian reserves through the planned Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline. Egypt could provide of natural gas through the Arab Gas Pipeline. Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has urged Egypt to export natural gas to Europe via the Nabucco pipeline. Iran has also proposed to supply gas to Nabucco pipeline and this was backed by Turkey; however, due to the political conditions this is rejected by the EU and the United States. Nabucco-West is designated to carry Azeri gas from the second stage of Shah Deniz through TANAP pipeline. The pipeline is able to transport between 10 ‚Äì 23 BCM annually from the Shah Deniz gas field. OMV, a shareholder in Nabucco, also suggested that Nabucco will be used to transport gas from its Domino-1 deep-sea offshore well in the Black Sea. The Domino-1 well was OMV's largest gas find with 1.5 ‚Äì 3 trillion cubic feet announced in February 2012. Project company The project was developed by the Vienna-registered Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH. The managing director of the company was Reinhardt Mitschek. The shareholders of the company are: * BOTA≈û (Turkey) * BEH (Bulgaria) * FGSZ (wholly owned subsidiary of MOL) (Hungary) * OMV (Austria) * Transgaz (Romania) Nabucco International is the owner of the five national Nabucco companies responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline in their respective countries. RWE left the project and on 1 March 2013 OMV took over all of RWE's shares. On 28 May 2013, it was announced that GDF Suez, a French utilities provider, agreed to buy a 9% stake from OMV. Alternative projects Map of Nabucco and TANAP Major existing and planned natural gas pipelines supplying Russian gas to Europe The main competitor for the original project was South Stream. In 2006, Gazprom proposed an alternative project, in competition with the Nabucco pipeline, that would involve constructing a second section of the Blue Stream pipeline beneath the Black Sea to Turkey, and extending this up through Bulgaria and Serbia to western Hungary. In 2007, instead the South Stream project through Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia to Austria and Italy was proposed. On 10 March 2010, CEO of Eni, a partner in South Stream, Paolo Scaroni proposed to merge Nabucco and South Stream projects to \\"reduce investments, operational costs and increase overall returns\\". This proposal was rejected by energy minister of Russia Sergei Shmatko saying that \\"South Stream is more competitive than Nabucco\\" and that \\"Nabucco and South Stream are far from being competitors\\". According to Nobuo Tanaka, former executive director of the International Energy Agency, the Nabucco pipeline would be more effective in increasing Europe's energy security than the South Stream project as it would increase the number of gas suppliers. Even more important competitor became TANAP which would follow the Nabucco's original route in Turkey. Therefore, Nabucco consortium modified the project and sees the modified Nabucco-West as a prolongation of TANAP into Central Europe. Nabucco West competed with the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the Interconnector Turkey‚ÄìGreece‚ÄìItaly projects. Also liquefied natural gas was seen as competitor to Nabucco and to pipeline projects in general. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania and Hungary are developing Azerbaijan‚ÄìGeorgia‚ÄìRomania Interconnector project, which is proposed to transport Azerbaijani gas to Europe in form of LNG. Increasing availability of LNG from large gas-producing countries in the Middle-East and Africa stresses the economic viability of pipelines. Controversial aspects =Economic and political aspects= The Nabucco pipeline will supply only a limited number of countries in South-East and Central Europe. In 2013, it was confirmed by Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev that the pipeline would transport gas to a minimum of 16 European countries including the gas hub in Baumgarten, Austria. The project has been criticized as uneconomic because there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable. The Nabucco Gas Pipeline project, although initially intending to secure gas from Iraq and Iran has readjusted its intentions given the current political and economic instabilities in the two countries. It will initially transport 10 BCM from the Shah Deniz gas field with the ability to increase its capacity to 23 BCM as demand increases, along with supply. One region that could also supply additional gas is the Black Sea, with OMV and Exxon Mobil announcing an enormous gas discovery in February 2012. The deputy chairman of the Russia's State Duma Energy Committee Ivan Grachev has questioned the viability of the Nabucco project and sees it as an attempt to put pressure on Russia. This is supported by Russia's gas deals with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, which by some observers has been seen as attempt to reserve potential Nabucco supplies. Azerbaijan has stated that the gas will be transported only through those routes, which would be commercially most attractive. Also the opening of the Central Asia ‚Äì China gas pipeline and the agreements to build the South Stream pipeline has been seen as the end of Nabucco project. However, before the raise of project's costs and the proposal of modified project, RWE had claimed that the transportation of natural gas through the Nabucco pipeline would be cheaper than through South Stream or other alternative pipelines. According to RWE, the transportation of thousand cubic meters of gas from Shah Deniz field to Europe will cost through the Nabucco pipeline ‚Ç¨77 versus ‚Ç¨106 through the South Stream pipeline. Russian opposition to the pipeline stems from their monopoly over European gas supplies. The Pipeline would lead to cheaper more secure gas supplies for the whole of Europe, due to the decreased influence of the oil linked gas price, this would provide economic benefits to the EU with cheaper energy helping the union become more competitive. NGOs have also criticized the fact that the pipeline results in effective support of the authoritarian regime in Turkmenistan, which undermines the European Union's policy of human rights promotion.Nabucco gas pipeline, CEE Bankwatch Network. =Fossil fuels= Some NGOs criticize the EIB and EBRD for their willingness to finance a fossil fuel project, claiming that it goes against the November 2007 resolution on trade and climate change passed in the European Union Parliament. The resolution calls for \\"the discontinuation of public support via export credit agencies and public investment banks, for fossil fuel projects.\\" Non-governmental organizations also show disapproval, due to the public banks decision to be lenient to Turkmenistan Human and civil rights conditions. =Security aspects= Concerns have been raised about the safety of the project. Gas for the Nabucco pipeline coming from Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan will have to pass near areas of instability in the South Caucasus.

They were known as \\"The Troika\\" by some observers of the White House due to their influence over policy while they served on the White House staff. As Deputy Chief of Staff at the White House, Deaver worked primarily on media management forming how the public perceived Reagan, sometimes by engineering press events so that the White House set the networks' agenda for covering the president. On March 30, 1981, Deaver stood feet away from John Hinckley as he fired at Reagan, wounding him. Deaver later supported Nancy Reagan in the hospital as she arrived. Deaver resigned from the White House staff in May 1985. Perjury conviction On March 18, 1987, Deaver was convicted of perjury for congressional testimony he had submitted.  Deaver Is Sentenced To Suspended Term And $100,000 Fine  PHILIP SHENON  SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES  He was convicted on three of five counts of perjury stemming from statements to a congressional subcommittee and federal grand jury investigating his lobbying activities with administration officials. Deaver blamed alcoholism for lapses in memory and judgment. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but the sentence was reduced to three years of probation and a fine of $100,000. Deaver was also ordered to perform 1,500 hours of public service. In the final days of Reagan's presidency the question of a pardon arose, but Reagan noted in his diaries that Deaver indicated he would not accept a pardon. Later life and death Shortly after Deaver resigned from the White House, he formed Michael K. Deaver, Inc. and became a lobbyist. For a time he was in business with another Reagan aide, Peter D. Hannaford in a public relations firm named Deaver and Hannaford. In his later years, he wrote three books: Behind the Scenes (1988; co-written with Mickey Herskowitz), A Different Drummer: My Thirty Years with Ronald Reagan (2001; foreword by Nancy Reagan), and Nancy: A Portrait of My Years with Nancy Reagan (2004). In 2005, he edited and published a collection of essays titled Why I Am a Reagan Conservative. Deaver also worked at the Washington, D.C. office of Edelman, a public relations agency, a role he held from 1992‚Äì2006, ultimately as chairman of the D.C. office. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2001, Deaver said, \\"I've always said the only thing I did is light [Reagan] well... My job was filling up the space around the head. I didn't make Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan made me.\\" According to former First Lady and longtime friend Nancy Reagan, Deaver's greatest skill \\"was in arranging what were known as good visuals ‚Äî televised events or scenes that would leave a powerful symbolic image in people's minds.\\" In 2006, Deaver was awarded an honorary degree from Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n in Guatemala City, Guatemala.\\"Doctorado Honor√≠fico a Michael K. Deaver durante el Acto de Graduaci√≥n\\". University website. Retrieved 2011-02-01. Deaver died of pancreatic cancer on August 18, 2007 at age 69 at his home in Maryland. He is survived by his wife, Carolyn, and their two children, Amanda Deaver of Washington, D.C., and Blair Deaver of Bend, Oregon. In a statement, Nancy Reagan, said: \\"[Deaver] was the closest of friends to both Ronnie and me in many ways, and he was like a son to Ronnie... We met great challenges together... I will miss Mike terribly.\\"Obituaries  Death Notices  Newspaper Obituaries  Online Obituaries  Newspaper Death Notices  Online Death Notices References External links * Spartacus Educational Biography * Obituary from FOX News * Obituary from the Boston Herald * Legacy.com Obituary * Recent Interview on Retirement Living TV * * Category:1938 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American government officials convicted of crimes Category:American perjurers Category:American political consultants Category:Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan Category:California politicians convicted of crimes Category:California Republicans Category:Deaths from cancer in Maryland Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Maryland Republicans Category:People from Bethesda, Maryland Category:Politicians from Bakersfield, California Category:Reagan administration controversies Category:Reagan administration personnel Category:San Jose State University alumni Category:White House Deputy Chiefs of Staff ","title":"Michael Deaver"},{"id":"3623218","text":"Lansdowne, is a cantonment town in Pauri Garhwal district in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Lansdowne or Lansdown is a town and a hill station situated on the Kotdwar - Pauri road at a height of 1,780 m in Uttarakhand, India. Lansdowne is located in the Pauri district of Uttarakhand, 45 km from Kotdwar. History Originally known as Kaludanda () after Kalu (Black) and Danda (hills) in Garhwali, Lansdowne was founded and named after then Viceroy of India (1888-1894), Lord Lansdowne in 1887, and by 1901 it had a population of 3943.Lansdowne The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 16, p. 135. Lansdowne was developed by the British for catering for the Recruits Training center of the Garhwal Rifles. Lansdowne was a major place of the activities of freedom fighters from British Garhwal during British period. Nowadays, the famous Garhwal Rifles of the Indian Army has its command office here.The Garhwal Rifles Lansdowne is one of the quietest hill stations of India and is popular since the British came to India. Lansdowne is unlike other hill stations as it is well connected with motorable roads but remote in its own way. It is situated at an altitude of 1,706 m above sea level surrounded with thick oak and blue pine forests in the Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand state. On 5 November 1887, the first battalion of Garhwal Rifles migrated from Almora to Lansdowne. Lansdowne was the only city after Almora in the late 1870s. People of different culture and states came to do business in Lansdowne after it became popular. The buildings and church of Lansdowne built during British period, which dates back to the pre-independence period. Lansdowne is an ideal location for eco-tourism as it is well preserved by the Government of Uttarakhand and the Garhwal Rifles. There is a road situated between jaiharikhal and Lansdowne which is called cool road( ‡§†‡§®‡•ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§°‡§º‡§ï) where Indians were not allowed during the British times, it was only meant for Europeans. For the movement of Indians, a parallel road situated below this road was used. Local attractions The War Memorial, at the Parade Ground of the Garhwal Rifles Center, is an attraction for the visitors. However, prior permission from the military authority has to be obtained. Places of interest around the city include Tip n Top View Point, Kaleshwar Mahadev Temple, which is the most visited Temple in Lansdowne and attracts thousands of devotees during the month of Sawan ( Indian Monsoon ), Santoshi Mata Temple, Regimental Museum (also called the Darwan Singh Sanghralaya), Bhullatal Lake, St. Mary's Church, and Lover's lane. Excursions from the city can go to the Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple, Bhairav Garhi Temple, Bhim Pakora. The Annual ‚ÄòSharadotsava‚Äô (Festival of Autumn) is also organized at this hill station during the autumn season. The old cemetery in Kitchner Lines is one of the more mysterious places and some even call it one of the most haunted places in Lansdowne. Many war veterans have been laid to rest in the old cemetery and the graves date back to the mid-1850s. The Garhwal Rifles Regimental Museum, also called Darwan Singh Sanghralaya, houses artefacts from the beginning of the Regiment. The Garhwal Rifles participated in the two world wars among countless other battles throughout its more than 100 years of history. Many artifacts, including photographs, arms used by regimental commanders, captured weapons, campaign history and other information are displayed in this museum. There are many items, such as medals won by erstwhile Garhwal Rifle soldiers, that have been put on display, including the Victoria Cross awarded to Darwan Singh Negi and Gabar Singh Negi. Lansdowne is also famous for its standard of education.  How to reach Lansdowne It is the nearest hill station to Delhi and can be reached by either road or train. The nearest railway station is Kotdwar at a distance of 44 km situated at an elevation of only 370 m. Since Lansdowne is more than 1,300 m higher than Kotdwara, the drive from Kotdwara to Lansdowne is quite steep and scenic. The nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport, near Dehradun at a distance of 152 km via the Kotdwar-Haridwar road. The other and better route to Lansdowne is by road from Delhi via Meerut, Bijnore, Najibabad, Kotdwar and on to Lansdowne. It saves about 50 km and the road quality is good all the way to Kotdwar. The Garhwal Rifles have painted a huge signboard with directions on rocks at the right-hand turn from the NH-119 that leads to Lansdowne. Lansdowne is 83 km from Pauri and about 250 km from Delhi. The drive through Blue Pine trees on hills near Lansdowne is a wonderful experience. However, this route has a lot of foot traffic and there are traffic jams during the Kanwar Yatra. Geography  Nearby places  Famous Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple with its special Shivalinga and a Kund (a small pond) known as Gauri Kund is situated 39 km away from Lansdowne. People take bath in Gauri Kund before entering the temple. Two other famous temples, Durga Devi Temple and Jwalpa Devi, which are on the Pauri-Kotdwar road are 24 km and 47 km away respectively. Durga Devi Temple is one of the oldest Siddha Pithas in India. Kanvashram, a well-known landmark is situated 14 km from Kotdwar railway station. Shakuntala, wife of King Dushyanta and deserted by him, is said to have given birth to Bharata in the Ashram of Rishi Kanva in ancient India. India got its name 'Bharat' in Sanskrit after Bharata became king following the death of his father. Demographics India census, Lansdowne had a population of 7902. Males constitute 64% of the population and females 36%. Lansdowne has an average literacy rate of 86%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 91%, and female literacy is 79%.

Hogan was a left arm spinner who played in seven Tests and 16 One Day Internationals for Australia in 1983 and 1984. Career Hogan made his debut for Western Australia in 1981‚Äì82. He scored 70 in a game against Victoria and 49 against WA. He took 20 wickets at 36.75 for the summer.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/AUS/1981-82_f_Bowling_by_Wickets.html Hogan had a strong 1982‚Äì83 summer. He scored 72 against NSW and took eight wickets against Qld. At the end of the summer he was picked in Australia's one day team to play New Zealand, replacing Dennis Lillee who was made 12th man. He took 2‚Äì42 and made 4 not out. He was kept on in the squad. He was picked on a 1983 tour of Sri Lanka, one of two spinners (the other was Bruce Yardley). By the end of the summer he had taken 35 first class wickets at 26.82 ‚Äì out of the spinners, only Bruce Yardley and Murray Bennett had taken more. =Sri Lanka Tour= Hogan was picked in the first ODI. He had an excellent game, scoring 27 off 25 balls, taking a catch and earning bowling figures of 3‚Äì27. Things were harder in the 2nd ODI, Hogan going for 1‚Äì62. He took 3‚Äì37 and 3‚Äì42 in a tour game against the Sri Lankan Board President's XI. He was selected in the test, bowling in tandem with Yardley. Hogan struggled in his first innings, going for 1‚Äì51, but did superbly in the second, taking 5‚Äì66 and helping Australia win by an innings. He made 12 wickets at 16 for the tour, Australia's best performing bowler. These efforts saw Hogan picked as the sole specialist spinner for the 1983 World Cup. He was picked over Bruce Yardley, who then retired from international cricket. =1983 World Cup= Hogan was picked to play against India ‚Äì he took the place of Dennis Lillee who was made 12th man. Hogan took 2‚Äì48. He kept his place for the next game, against Zimbabwe, taking 2‚Äì33. He went to 1‚Äì31 in the loss against India and 1‚Äì60 against West Indies. =1983‚Äì84 Summer= Hogan was picked in the Australian side for the first test against the touring Pakistan side. However captain Kim Hughes decided on using an all-pace attack and Hogan was made 12th man. Australia won the game easily and kept the same twelve for the second club. Hogan took 3‚Äì91 and 1‚Äì107 in a shield game and was 12th man again as Australia used four pace bowlers. An injury to Carl Rackemann saw Hogan selected for the 3rd test. He suffered badly at the hands of the Pakistan batsman, going for 1‚Äì107 and was dropped for the squad for the fourth and fifth test in favour of Murray Bennett and Greg Matthews. Hogan was later dropped from the Australian one day team. However he bounced back with 5‚Äì31 against Victoria and wound up with 26 first class wickets at 33 for the summer. He took more first class wickets than any other Australian spinner. Hogan was picked on the 1984 tour of West Indies. He and Greg Matthews would be the spinners; Murray Bennett, Peter Sleep and Bob Holland, who had also had strong domestic seasons, were overlooked. He also worked his way back into the one day team, taking 1‚Äì22 against Pakistan and 0‚Äì31 and 6 runs in a thrilling tie against the West Indies. He went for 0‚Äì39 in the last ODI final. =1984 Tour of the West Indies= Hogan was the sole specialist spinner in the Australian squad, and thus had an excellent chance of being given an extended run in the test team. He bowled poorly in the opening tour game against Leeward Islands but then took 5‚Äì95 against Guyana, almost forcing a victory and out bowling Matthews. He was picked in the side for the first test. Australia batted first and were 9‚Äì182 when Hogan combined with Rodney Hogg for a partnership of 97, a record tenth wicket stand for Australia against the West Indies (Hogan made 42), and took the total to 279. Hogan took 4‚Äì56 in the West Indies first innings, bowling very well. However Australia's batters collapsed again, Hogan went for 0‚Äì76 in the second innings and Australia were lucky to escape with a draw. In the second test, Hogan went for 2‚Äì103 but his second innings of 38, coming in as nightwatchman, proved crucial in helping Australia escape with a draw. In the third test he again made useful runs as nightwatchman, 40 in Australia's first innings, but went for 0‚Äì97 as Australia crashed to defeat. In the fourth test he took 0‚Äì65 and in the 5th took 2‚Äì68. He played in the 3rd and 4th ODIs,taking 0‚Äì31 and 0‚Äì31. Hogan took 22 wickets at 39.45 for the tour (the second highest wicket taker) and 8 at 60 for the series (the third highest wicket taker). He was picked in the 14 man squad to tour India for a series of one day matches; he and Bennett were the spinners. =1984 Tour of India= Hogan took 4‚Äì33 in a tour game. He bowled well in the series, taking 3‚Äì44 in the first ODI 4‚Äì33 in the second, and 2‚Äì40 in the 4th. Australia won the series 3‚Äì0. =Rebel Tours= Hogan was thought to be a \\"certain inclusion\\" for the squad for the first test against the West Indies in 1984‚Äì85. However he was overlooked when Australia went for an all pace attack. Murray Bennett and Bob Holland would be Australia's preferred spinners that summer; they and Greg Matthews were selected on the 1985 tour of England. Hogan took 26 wickets that season but at a very expensive average of 51. After being left out of the Australian team, Hogan joined the Australian rebel tours to South Africa for two seasons (1985/86 and 1986/87). He replaced Bennett, who had originally signed to go but changed his mind after his international prospects improved. He and Trevor Hohns were the two spinners. He was banned from test cricket for three years and Shield cricket for two years. Hogan began the tour excellently scoring 74 off 77 balls in a tour game against Transvaal Country and making 63 and taking 8‚Äì89 against Eastern Province. His form dropped away and he took 16 wickets at 38.6 in the first summer- although he still performed better than Trevor Hohns. Hogan did not recover his form on the second tour, taking 10 first class wickets at 39.4. He was easily out bowled by Hohns who took 33 wickets. In 1987 he played in the Lancashire League for Lowerhouse. =Later career= Hogan ‚Äì along with the other South African rebels ‚Äì was overlooked for selection in WA's team for the first Sheffield Shield game of the 1987‚Äì88 summer. He was picked to play against Sri Lanka but did not bowl. He was kept in the team to play Tasmania and took 6‚Äì57. Hogan said he had been as \\"nervous as a newcomer\\" and had not bowled well early. \\"But once I dropped on to a length my confidence came back and I was able to get quite a bit of turn, especially from a spot just short of a length out side the off stump from the river end,\\" he said. \\"It's the first time I've bowled in a first-class match for West Australia this season because when we were in the field against Sri Lanka I had to dash off to hospital because my wife, Helen, was having a baby.\\" He took nine first class wickets for the summer at 22.66 and WA won the Sheffield Shield. In 1988‚Äì89 he played the first five games for WA and took 12 wickets at 30 before being dropped. He got back into the team to end the summer with 14 wickets at 36.5. He also scored his maiden first class century, 115 against Victoria. Greg Chappell and Richie Benaud both listed Hogan in their squads to tour England in 1989 but in the final event Tim May and Trevor Hohns were taken as spinners. Hogan did help WA win the Shield for a third consecutive time and he got to tour India with a WA team. In 1989‚Äì90 Hogan took 18 wickets at 35.6 with a best of 5‚Äì60. His last first class game was in 1990‚Äì91. Later career Hogan was appointed a WA selector in 2003‚Äì04.

He was a middle-order batsman, and later a wicket-keeper. He was a member of the Tasmanian side that won their first domestic title in the 1978/79 Gillette Cup. Early career From a cricketing family, Woolley attended New Town High School in Hobart and played league cricket in England with Great Harwood Cricket Club in the Ribblesdale League.Findlay, p. 76. Woolley made his first-class debut in Tasmania's initial Sheffield Shield season, 1977‚Äì78. After he missed Tasmania's first two games, which they lost easily, Woolley was selected as a middle-order batsman, and scored 49, 55, 103, one, 29 and 32 not out, helping Tasmania draw all three games. Of his century, Wisden said: \\"23-year-old Hobart insurance broker Roger Woolley confirmed earlier promise by hitting a delightful 103 in two and three-quarter hours. Displaying a fine array of cuts and drives, and a mature choice of the right ball to hit, he became the first Tasmanian-born player to score a Shield century for his home state.\\"Wisden 1979, p. 996. In his third match Woolley also kept wicket, taking four catches and a stumping and conceding only three byes. Woolley remained Tasmania's keeper until the 1985‚Äì86 season, except when a knee injury forced him to miss most of the 1980‚Äì81 season.Wisden 1982, p. 1002. In 1978‚Äì79, against Western Australia in Devonport, Tasmania were chasing 357 for victory and had lost 6 for 187 when the captain, Jack Simmons, joined Woolley and they put on an unbroken seventh- wicket partnership of 172 to give Tasmania their first victory in the Shield; Woolley finished on 99 not out.Wisden 1980, pp. 1053‚Äì54. Playing for Australia Woolley proved to be a good wicket-keeper, and had his career not paralleled that of Rod Marsh he probably would have played more international cricket. In the 1982‚Äì83 season Woolley scored 551 runs at 42.38 and took 39 catches and two stumpings, and he got his chance for Australia when Marsh was unavailable for the brief tour of Sri Lanka in April 1983. He played in all four one-day matches and the single Test, becoming Tasmania's first Test player since its entry to the Sheffield Shield. Australia so dominated the Test match in Kandy that he was not needed to bat, but he took five catches in the innings victory. He was selected for the tour of the West Indies in 1983‚Äì84 as deputy keeper to Wayne Phillips. He played only the Fourth Test in St John's, keeping wickets when Phillips opened the innings, but he scored only 13 and 8 in an innings defeat for Australia. At the time the Australian journalist Peter McFarline said his wicketkeeping \\"generally was again a long way short of the standard necessary.\\"Peter McFarline, 'Carl and Co Stem the Windies', The Age, 11 April 1984 accessed 23 July 2012 Later career He had his most successful season with the bat in 1984‚Äì85, scoring 717 runs at 51.21, including his highest first-class score of 144 (and 61 in the second innings) against Western Australia in Perth. But, captaining a Tasmanian side that won none of its ten matches and finished last in the Shield, the quality of Woolley's keeping deteriorated. John MacKinnon in Wisden noted that \\"his wicket-keeping was erratic and his captaincy was inhibited by lack of confidence in his team\\".Wisden 1986, p. 999. He played the rest of his career as a batsman, retiring after two matches in 1987‚Äì88. Woolley was captain of the Tasmanian one-day side from 1982‚Äì83 until 1985‚Äì86, and although he also captained the first-class side on 28 occasions, he was never officially appointed as Tasmanian captain. He later made his career in real estate. He regularly provides comments on ABC radio broadcasts of matches in Tasmania. References Sources * Findlay, R. (ed.)

The Methodist Church at 18 Main St. was built in 1839. There is a blacksmith shop across from the church which dates back to that same era, the time of the Erie Canal. Remains of the Rexford Aqueduct in 2016Rexford was the site of an aqueduct that brought vessels traveling the Erie Canal across the Mohawk River. The aqueduct was built in 1841. Large arches which supported its towpath can still be seen from the Route 146 bridge crossing the river today. The Schenectady Yacht Club is located in a former canal store, built circa 1900. The Club uses the remains of Lock 21, which is on its grounds, for moving boats in and out of the river. Lock 21 was built in 1842 as part of an enlargement of the Canal. Rexford once had a 2-room schoolhouse, located at the corner of Riverview and what is now Route 146. This was razed in the 1960s and replaced by a firehouse, which was replaced by a Stewart's convenience store in 2001. The firehouse is now located north of the intersection on Route 146. In the early 1900s, there was an amusement park at Rexford with rides, games, and refreshments. Trolleys brought people from the city of Schenectady. The park was known as Luna Park, Dolle's Park, Colonnade Park, Palisades Park, and Rexford Park.Susan Rosenthal, Schenectady (Arcadia, 2000) Description of Luna Park/Dolle's Park - Capital District Library Council The McLane Hotel, razed in 1964, was a stop for stagecoaches and canal boats.

The latter picture was a box-office hit.. Plot Cheryl Draper looks out of her bedroom window, and witnesses a young woman being strangled to death and reports it to the police, but when the killer, Albert Richter, sees detectives arriving downstairs, he moves the body. When the police show up to his door, Albert acts nonchalant, and, when no body is found, the police are convinced that Cheryl dreamt it up. The next day, Albert puts the body in a trunk and leaves to dispose of it. While he is out, Cheryl notices that an apartment on the same floor is for rent, and she is given a tour by the building manager. She finds torn drapery, which Albert dubiously re-ripped in front of the police, and a pair of earrings. Albert returns and sees Cheryl drive away to the police department with the earrings. He pre-emptively phones the police, and Cheryl is accused of robbery. The two confront each other at the police station, but Albert opts not to press charges. However, the scene leaves Police Lt. Lawrence Mathews suspicious. Lawrence goes to Cheryl's apartment and tells her that Albert is an ex-Nazi who had been \\"denazified\\" and is now an unsuccessful author who is marrying a wealthy heiress. The two meet again when the body of an unidentified woman is found in a park. Cheryl comes off as conspiratorial and Lawrence believes she is pretending and obsessing about the case; he believes she is telling the truth that she saw something, but does not think what she saw was reality. She is forcibly admitted to an insane asylum after Albert surreptitiously types threatening letters from Cheryl to him to frame her as crazy and a threat to his safety. While Cheryl is away, Lawrence and a fellow policeman go to the apartment building of the deceased woman to see if anyone there recognizes Albert but no one does, and the police have no case. After Cheryl is released, Albert is at her home and confesses that he killed the woman because she was insignificant to him and he did not want his future wealth to be threatened. However, because she is officially labeled insane by the police and has no credibility, he does not fear admitting anything to her. Albert later returns to her home with a purported suicide note wherein Cheryl says she will kill herself, and he tries to push her out of her window. Just as he is about to throw her out, a policewoman buzzes at the door and Cheryl flees. She is pursued by Albert, as well as the police, who think she is suicidal. Cheryl runs up a high-rise that is under construction, and gets to the top and is cornered by Albert, and he pushes her off the tower. There are a few construction planks below the precipice onto which she falls and is saved. Lawrence arrives and Albert attempts to push him off as well, but after a brief struggle, it is Albert who falls to his death. Lawrence rescues Cheryl and the police now come to believe her story.

His camerawork sets a dark mood of the Los Angeles scenario, escalating the dramatics with shadowy building shots. The twist in the story is that as upstanding a citizen as Stanwyck is, the authorities still side with the Nazi Sanders because he has a higher status. The noir theme of alienation is richly furnished. But the rub is in the story's credibility -- Stanwyck was just too strong a character to be so completely victimized.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

He also served as one of three co-deans of the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak, along with Rabbis Shmuel Rozovsky and Dovid Povarsky. Due to his differences with the Hasidic leadership of the Agudat Yisrael in 1984, he allied with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who had founded the Shas party. Later, in 1988, Shach sharply criticized Ovadia Yosef, saying that, \\"Sepharadim are not yet ready for leadership positions\\",'Haaretz' daily newspaper, Shachar Ilan, November 2, 2001 and subsequently founded the Degel HaTorah political party representing Lithuanian (non-Hasidic) Ashkenazi Jews in the Israeli Knesset.  Life in Europe  Passport photo (1920s) Elazar Menachem Man Shach was born in Vabalninkas (Vaboilnik in Yiddish), a rural village in northern Lithuania, to Rabbi Ezriel and Batsheva Shach. The Shach family had been merchants for generations, but Batsheva's family, the Levitans, were religious scholars who served various Lithuanian communities. Batsheva's brother, Rabbi Osher Nisan Levitan, later became an important figure in the Union of Orthodox Rabbis in the United States. Elazar was an illui (child prodigy).Rabbi Eliezer Schach, Torah giant, dies at age 103 Ilan, Shahar. Canadian Jewish News. Nov 8, 2001. Vol. 31, Iss. 46; pg. 41 In 1909, at the age of 11, Shach went to study at the Ponevezh Yeshiva, which at the time was located in the city of Panevƒó≈æys, Lithuania, and was headed by Rabbi Isaac Jacob Rabinowitz, known as Rav Itzele Ponovezer. In 1913, Shach started studying in Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka). When World War I began in 1914, many of the Slabodka yeshiva students were dispersed across Europe. Shach initially returned to his family, but then began traveling across Lithuania from town to town, sleeping and eating wherever he could, while continuing to study Torah. In 1915, following the advice of Rabbi Yechezkel Bernstein (author of Divrei Yechezkel), Shach traveled to Slutsk to study at the yeshiva there. It was in Slutsk that he met Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, and this was the beginning of a close life-long relationship between the two. Shach also met Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz (head of the Novardok yeshiva), who had come to visit the yeshiva in order to introduce its students to the study of mussar (see Musar movement). Around this time, he also met for the first time Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, as Feinstein would often visit Meltzer at his house in Slutsk. In 1921, as a result of regional political changes, the Slutsk yeshiva split up. Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer stayed in the city of Slutsk, while Meltzer's son-in-law, Rabbi Aharon Kotler, took his students and started a yeshiva in the town of Kletsk. Shach joined Kotler in Kletsk, and subsequently was appointed by Kotler as a maggid shiur (\\"lecturer [in Talmud]\\") in the yeshiva. In 1923, Shach married Meltzer's niece, Guttel Gilmovski. After the wedding, Shach and his wife moved to Mir, Belarus, the residence of his father-in-law. After spending some time in the city of Mir, Shach moved back to Kletsk to join the yeshiva again. In 1925, his wife's uncle, Rabbi Meltzer, moved to Israel, and it was at this point that Shach became significantly more involved in the daily running of the yeshiva. It was around this time that Rabbi Yechezkel Levenstein joined the yeshiva to become its mashgiach ruchani (\\"spiritual guide\\"), and thus began a life-long relationship of mutual respect between Shach and Levenstein. After the passing of Rabbi Meir Shapiro, head of the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski sent the yeshivah's administrators a letter, recommending Shach for the position. After delivering a discourse at the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, Shach traveled to Vilna to consult with Grodzinski about the wisdom of taking on the new position, and upon hearing the various aspects of the question, Grodzinski advised Shach to turn down the offer. In 1934, Shach was appointed rosh yeshiva of the Novardok yeshiva. This came about as a result of the recommendation of Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (known as the Chazon Ish) to one of the yeshiva's founders, Rabbi Bentzion Brook.Path to Greatness ‚Äì The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899‚Äì1953) ‚Äì pg. 454 During this time in Shach's life, the rest of his family stayed in Kletsk, while he stayed in the Novardok yeshiva for extended periods of time. After approximately two years, Shach left the yeshiva, saying that \\"this is not the place for me for many reasons\\".Letter to a student.  Escaping to the British Mandate of Palestine  Shortly before the start of World War II and the Holocaust, several yeshivas began considering evacuating their rabbis, students, and families. Aharon Kotler escaped to the United States, traveling across Siberia and arriving in the United States during the war. In 1939, Shach first went to Vilna, where he stayed with Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski. Later that year, both Shach's mother and his eldest daughter fell ill, and died. In early 1940, the Shach family decided to leave Lithuania. Shach's maternal uncle, Rabbi Aron Levitan, had helped Kotler get emigration visas to the United States, but Shach, after consulting with Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik and Rabbi Grodzinski,Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 56 decided instead to go to Palestine, where Meltzer was serving as Rosh Yeshiva at Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Shach would later serve as the Rosh Yeshiva there as well. His uncle helped him and his family get immigration certificates, and took them in after they arrived at his doorstep in a destitute condition. Several years after the re- establishment of the Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Shach was asked by Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman to be one of its deans. Shach first discussed the proposal with Rabbi Soloveitchik, and was encouraged by the latter to take the position.Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 60 Shach served in that capacity from 1954 until his death. At this yeshiva, Shach delivered a lecture on the Talmud every Tuesday, and also occasionally gave other classes to the student body of the yeshiva.  Rabbinical career  Shach received rabbinical ordination from Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer,Path to Greatness ‚Äì The Life of Maran Harav Elazar Menachem Man Shach, Vol I: Vaboilnik to Bnei Brak (1899‚Äì1953) ‚Äì pg. 262 and served as chairman of Chinuch Atzmai and Va'ad HaYeshivos.In Their Shadow: Wisdom and Guidance of the Gedolim Volume One: Chazon Ish, Brisker Rav, Rav Shach pg. 282 In the mid-1960s, Shach was offered a position to serve as a senior rosh hayeshiva at Yeshiva University in New York, to which he politely declined. From 1970 until his death, Shach was generally recognized by Lithuanian Haredim and some other Haredi circles as the Gadol Ha- Dor.Encyclopedia Judaica ‚Äì Macmillan Reference USA; Second edition (2006) During his lifetime, Shach was a revered spiritual mentor of more than 100,000 Orthodox Jews, and was credited by many with promoting the concept of the \\"society of learners\\" in the post-war Haredi world. Under his aegis, the phenomenon of Haredi men studying the Talmud in yeshivas and kollels full-time gained popularity. Although this type of set-up was unprecedented in Jewish history,Jweekly November 9, 2001 David Landau JTA it became the norm in some Haredi communities in Israel and the United States, with some financial backing and donations from Haredi communities, as well as subsidies to young families with many children from the Israeli government.  Political life  For Shach, battling secularism and Zionism was not enough. During the years of his leadership, he also waged bitter wars against anybody he suspected of deviation from the classical Haredi path.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-1268268,00.html At the behest of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Shach joined the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah.The Legacy Of Maran Rav Aharon Kotler by Yitzchok Dershowitz, Feldheim Publishers (2006) ‚Äì pg. 137. http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50717&st;=&pgnum;=180 When Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin died in 1966, Shach became president of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, before later resigning from the Moetzes after the other leading rabbis refused to follow him.PONOVEZER ROSH HAYESHIVA RAV ELAZAR MENACHEM MAN SHACH, ZT\\"L (1894‚Äì2001) The Jewish Press ‚Äì Saturday, December 08 2001 ‚Äì by Rabbi Gershon Tannenbaum with Rabbi Yaakov Klass Shach wrote strongly in support of every observant citizen voting. He felt that a vote not cast for the right party or candidate was effectively a vote for the wrong party and candidate. This theme is consistent in his writings from the time that the State of Israel was established. Elazar Shach (late 1980s), seated center, looking down, holding book. Rabbis Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and Chaim Kanievsky are seated to his left. Shas ran for the 11th Knesset in 1984, and Shach called upon his \\"Lithuanian\\" followers to vote for it in the polls, a move that many saw as key political and religious move in Shach's split with the Hasidic-controlled Agudat Yisrael. While initially, Shas was largely under the aegis of Shach, Ovadia Yosef gradually exerted control over the party, culminating in Shas' decision to support the Labor party in the 13th Knesset in 1992. On the eve of the November 1988 election, Shach officially broke away from Agudat Israel in protest at Hamodia publishing, as paid advertisements, a series of articles based on the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Shach criticized Schneerson for his presumed messianic aspirations. Shach wanted the Aguda party to oppose Lubavitch; however, all but one (Belz) of the Hasidic groups within the party refused to back him. Shach and his followers then formed the Degel HaTorah (\\"Flag of Torah\\") party to represent the non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredim. Following a personal visit by Shach to the halachic decisors and leading rabbis, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, in Jerusalem to seek their support for the new party, they agreed to lend support to the new party.Davar ‚Äì 02/10/1988 ‚Äì pg. 3 ‚Äì Noach Zvuluny - http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article2971_19881002.asp Schneerson's followers mobilized to support the Agudat Yisrael party. In the end, Agudat Yisrael secured nearly three times the number of votes it had in 1984, and increased its Knesset representation from two seats to five, while Degel HaTorah only picked up two seats. After the bitter contest in the 1988 elections, Degel HaTorah conceded and agreed to work together with Agudat Yisrael. They combined forces in the 1992 elections, under the name of United Torah Judaism (UTJ) Yahadut HaTorah HaMeukhedet in Hebrew, an agreement which has continued to the present. In a speech delivered prior to the 1992 elections, Shach said that Sephardim were still not fit for leadership, and aroused great anger among Sephardi voters. Following the elections, Shach instructed Shas not to join the government, while Ovadia Yosef instructed them to join - this precipitated an open rift between the parties. Shach then declared that Shas had removed itself from the Jewish community when it joined the wicked...'Haaretz', Shachar Ilan, November 2, 2001 Around 1995, Shach's political activity diminished, following deterioration in his health, before later ceasing altogether. After that, the two main leaders of the Degel HaTorah party were Rabbis Yosef Shalom Eliashiv (d. 2012) and continued by Aharon Leib Shteinman. Shach was deeply opposed to Zionism, both secular and religious. He was fiercely dismissive of secular Israelis and their culture. For example, during a 1990 speech, he lambasted secular kibbutzniks as \\"breeders of rabbits and pigs\\" who did not \\"know what Yom Kippur is\\". In the same speech, he said that the Labor Party had cut themselves off from their Jewish past and wished to \\"seek a new Torah\\". Labor Party politician Yossi Beilin said Shach's speech had set back relations between religious and secular Israelis by decades.Los Angeles Times ‚Äì November 3, 2001 from the Associated Press. In 1985, four years after the Labor Party supported a liberalized abortion law, Shach refused to meet with Shimon Peres, since he would not even speak with a \\"murderer of fetuses\\".Yair Sheleg: Chabad's Lost Son Ha'aretz, December 26, 2002.

See also Michtavim U'maamarim [5:569 (173)]. See also Jerusalem Post, Jan 31, 1993: \\"Schach says Schneerson is a False Messiah\\" Shach also compared Chabad and Schneerson to the followers of the 17th century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi.Summer of the Messiah (Jerusalem Report) February 14, 2001. Pointing to a statement by Schneerson that a rebbe is \\"the Essence and Being [of God] clothed [in] a body\\", Shach described this as nothing short of idolatry. His followers refused to eat meat slaughtered by Lubavitch shochetim, or to recognize Chabad Hasidim as adherents of authentic Judaism.The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference by David Berger, 2001, published by the Littman Library of Jewish Civilization of Portland. Page 7. Shach once described Schneerson as \\"the madman who sits in New York and drives the whole world crazy\\".The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 10, notes, KTAV Publishing, Despite this, Shach explained that he did not hold personal animosity toward Schneerson. When Schneerson became sick, Shach prayed for his recovery by reciting chapters from the Book of Psalms, explaining: \\"My battle is against his erroneous approach, against the movement, but not against the people in any personal way. I pray for the Rebbe's recovery and simultaneously, also pray that he abandon his invalid way.\\"Shlomo Lorincz, \\"HaRav Shach's Battle Against False Messianism\\" ‚Äî http://chareidi.org/archives5766/eikev/olubvlornczekv66.htm In addition to Shach's objections to certain Chabad members proclaiming Schneerson to be the Messiah, he also argued against the Chabad position on many other issues. Schneerson, citing case law in the Shulchan Aruch, strongly opposed both peace talks with the Palestinians and relinquishing territory to them under any circumstances, while Shach supported the \\"land for peace\\" approach. =Opposition to other Orthodox rabbis and groups= In addition to his criticism of Schneerson, Shach attacked the following rabbis: Joseph B. Soloveitchik In a lengthy attack on Joseph B. Soloveitchik (d. 1993) of Yeshiva University, Shach accused him of writing \\"things that are forbidden to hear\\",Letter of Shach ‚Äì Michtavim U-Ma‚Äôamarim, 4:320:page 36 as well as of \\"...endangering the survival of Torah-true Judaism by indoctrinating the masses with actual words of heresy\\".Speech of Shach (transcribed by a listener) ‚Äì Michtavim U-Ma‚Äôamarim, 4:370:page 107 The Gerer Rebbe Shach resigned from the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (\\"Council of Torah Greats\\") following tensions between him and the Gerer Rebbe, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter (d. 1992). In the Eleventh Knesset elections of 1984, Shach had already told his supporters to vote for Shas instead of Agudat Yisrael. Some perceived the schism as the reemergence of the dissent between Hasidim and Mitnagdim, as Shach represented the Lithuanian Torah world, while the Gerer Rebbe was among the most important Hasidic Rebbes and represented the most significant Hasidic court in Agudat Yisrael. However, it would not be accurate to base the entire conflict on a renewal of the historic dispute between Hasidim and Mitnagdim which began in the latter half of the eighteenth century.Friedman, Menachem jcpa.org/jl/vp104.htm Adin Steinsaltz Adin Steinsaltz (Even-Yisrael) (b. 1937) was likewise accused of heresy by Shach, who, in a letter written September 10, 1988, wrote that \\"... and similarly, all his other works contain heresy. It is forbidden to debate with Steinsaltz, because, as a heretic, all the debates will only cause him to degenerate more. He is not a genuine person (ein tocho ke-baro), and everyone is obliged to distance themselves from him. This is the duty of the hour (mitzvah be-sha‚Äôatah). It will generate merit for the forthcoming Day of Judgement.\\"Michtavim U-Ma‚Äôamarim. vol. 4 pp. 67 In the summer of 1989, a group of rabbis, including Shach, placed a ban on three of Steinsaltz's books.Davar ‚Äì 4/08/1989 ‚Äì pg. 3 ‚Äì Noach Zvuluny (Can be read online here :) The Modern Orthodox and Yeshiva University Shach wrote that Yeshiva University (YU) type institutions are an entirely negative phenomenon posing a threat to the very endurance of authentic Judaism. Shach said that these modern conceptions were \\"an absolute disaster, causing the destruction of our Holy Torah. Even the so-called 'Touro College' in the USA is a terrible disaster, a ' churban ha-das ' (destruction of the Jewish religion)...\\" Michtavim Umamarim Vol. 4 No. 319 Shach further writes that the success of those people who were able to achieve greatness in Torah despite their involvement in secular studies are \\"ma'aseh satan\\" (the work of the satanic forces), for the existence of such role models will entice others to follow suit, only to be doomed.Michtavim Umamarim vols. 1‚Äì2, p. 109, and letter no. 53. Vol. 4 no. 76 In a conversation that he had with an American rabbi in the 1980s, Shach stated, \\"The Americans think that I am too controversial and divisive. But in a time when no one else is willing to speak up on behalf of our true tradition, I feel myself compelled to do so.\\" =Position regarding Hasidim and Hasidism in general= Shach wroteMichtavim U'Maamaromim 5:533 (pg. 137). See also Jerusalem Post ‚Äì Mar 4, 1992 ‚Äì SCHACH'S ATTACKS 'MEANT ONLY FOR LUBAVITCHERS, NOT ALL HASSIDIM' that he was not at all opposed to Hasidim and Hasidism (including Hasidism of Chabad from the previous generationsMichtavim U'Maamorim 2:23 (pg. 31) 1986 edition.); he said he recognized them as \\"yera'im\\" and \\"shlaymim\\" (God-fearing and wholesome), and full of Torah and Mitzvos and fear of heaven.Michtavim U'Maamaromim 5:534 (pg. 138).

The Baal HaTanya will be the one to shake my hand!\\"Harav Schach: Shehamafteach B'yado by Moshe Horovitz. Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1989. page 105 On several occasions, Shach said to his students that it pained him deep inside over the sheim ra [\\"bad name\\"] he had acquired as a \\"hater of Hasidim\\". This was \\"total sheker [\\"lie\\"], he said resolutely. \\"We are fighting against secularism in the yeshivas. Today, besiyata deShmaya [\\"with the help of Heaven\\"], people are learning Torah in both Hasidic and Lithuanian yeshivos.

Shach had three children, all born in Kletsk in the 1920s: Miriam Raisel, Devorah, and Ephraim. Miriam Raisel died as a teenager in 1939 of pneumonia. Devorah married Rabbi Meir Tzvi Bergman, and had nine children. Ephraim was unsatisfied with the Haredi lifestyle, and eventually joined the Religious Zionist camp. Ephraim served in the Israel Defense Forces, received a doctorate in history and philosophy from the Bernard Revel Graduate School of Yeshiva University, and worked as a supervisor for the Israel Ministry of Education.

Early career  Bennett made a promising start to his career as a left arm orthodox spin bowler by making a successful foray into Sydney Grade Cricket for St. George in 1973-74 and was selected for the New South Wales combined schoolboy team. During the 1976-77 season, he broke into the New South Wales Colts, the state youth team. Playing in two matches for the summer, he took nine wickets at 10.44. In the second of these matches he scored 102 not out and took a total of 6/34 in an innings win over Queensland Colts. Despite this, he failed to gain selection in the youth team in the following season and he did not reappear until the 1978-79 season. He took six wickets at 12.66 but failed to make any impact with the bat, scoring 19 runs at 4.75. The following season, he played another two games for the Colts, taking five wickets at 28.80 and scoring an unbeaten 116 in one match.  First-class debut  However, the bespectacled Bennett was unable to break through to first-class level until his Sheffield Shield debut in the 1982‚Äì83 season at the age of 26. In his debut match against Western Australia, he took 2/74 from 52 overs including 25 maidens, his victims being for Test players Craig Serjeant and Tony Mann. He also scored an unbeaten 30 in a high-scoring draw. In the following match against Tasmania, he took 4/55 from 40.1 overs in another economical performance that featured 22 maidens, but was unable to prevent a seven-wicket defeat. Bennett went wicketless in the next match against South Australia, but did score an unbeaten 59, his maiden-first-class fifty. The spinner broke through for his first five-wicket haul in the next match against Western Australia. After taking 3/47 in the first innings, he claimed 5/39 to dismiss the Western Australians for 197. Of his match total of 65.2 overs, 39 were maidens. This left New South Wales with a target of 230 and Bennett made 21 not out to see them to the victory with four wickets in hand. Bennett continued his strong debut season in the next match against England, taking 4/65 and 5/123. In the first innings, he denied Geoff Cook his century, having him caught by fellow spinner Holland for 99, and in the second innings he removed Cook again this time for 77, as well as top-scorer Chris Tavare for 147. He made 29 in the lower-order in the run-chase, but was unable to prevent a 26-run defeat. Despite this, Bennett had taken 23 wickets at 21.08 in his first five matches at senior level. Bennett had less success in the second half of the season, only taking 15 wickets in the remaining eight matches, with a best of 4/9 against Victoria, totalling 6/106 for the match. His victims included Dav Whatmore and Dean Jones, removing both twice. New South Wales made the Shield final and Bennett was retained in spite of his modest late-season form. He contributed little in a narrow victory. His state batted first and contributed only in a total of 271. Bennett bowled economically, but was unable to take a wicket, conceding 50 runs from 29 overs as the Western Australians replied. In the second innings he managed only nine as New South Wales reached 280 to set a target of 293. Bennett was against wicketless, conceding 39 runs from 22 overs, but his colleagues were able to deliver with the ball and New South Wales won by 54 runs. Bennett ended his debut season with 38 wickets at 28.26 and 356 runs at 32.36. He played in three one-dayers for his state taking three wickets at 30.03 at an economy rate of 3.03. Bennett was rewarded with selection in a Young Australia team for a month-long tour of Zimbabwe. The squad played two first-class and two one-day matches against the hosts' national team. In the opening first-class fixture, Bennett scored 24 and totalled 2/49 as the tourists won by an innings. He then scored 21 and 35 in the Australians' 126 and 216 as the hosts squared the series; Holland took a total of 3/64. Bennett was not effective in the one-dayers; he took a total of 1/108 from 20 overs. Known for his accuracy and his well-disguised arm ball, he quickly formed an integral part of the bowling attack that made the state the dominant domestic team in the Sheffield Shield in the 1980s. Forming a spin-oriented attack with Bob Holland (leg spin) and Greg Matthews (off spin), Bennett played in all of New South Wales' ten round-robin Shield matches, as well as two first-class fixtures against the touring England and Sri Lankan cricket team. Bennett continued to struggle in limited-overs cricket the following Australian season. In the first match of the season against Western Australia, the opposition batsmen attacked him and he conceded 63 runs from his ten overs, scoring more than a third of their total from his bowling. As a result, Bennett was dropped from the one-day team for the rest of the season. The spinner maintained his position in the first- class team and played nine matches for New South Wales. In his third Shield match, Bennett made a tail-wagging 46 as New south Wales made 245. He then took 5/15 to dismiss the South Australians for 101, and his state went on to a 109-run win. In the return match, Bennett made 48 not out and took 3/45 in a high-scoring draw. He also scored 54 and took 3/62 in a match against Tasmania. Bennett otherwise did not take more than two wickets in an innings and ended with 20 wickets at 36.55 and 202 runs at 25.25. New South Wales failed to defend their title and did not qualify for the final.  ODI selection  During the winter of 1984, Bennett travelled to England to play in the Lancashire League for Ramsbottom Cricket Club as their overseas professional. He started relatively slowly, taking 12 wickets in his first five innings with the ball. Towards late June, he entered a strong run of form, taking 35 wickets in seven innings, claiming at least four wickets in each innings. Bennett scored five half-centuries with a best of 85 not out against Haslingden and best bowling figures of 7/27 against Lowerhouse. He took 83 wickets at 10.14 and scored 716 runs at 42.11. Despite his poor domestic form in one-dayers, Bennett was selected for the Australian team on a One Day tour to India in 1984, making his ODI debut in the fifth and final match of the series in Indore, taking an economical 0/37 from his ten overs as the hosts made 5/235. He was not required to bat as the Australians completed a six-wicket victory. He then took 1/33 from his ten overs as the tourists defeated Bombay before returning to Australia. In the 1984-85 Sheffield Shield, Bennett struggled to make the NSW team when not playing in Sydney, however, he made the most of his chance in the tour match against the powerful West Indians, the dominant team in world cricket at the time. Before this match, he had taken only two wickets in as many first-class matches for the season. In the first innings Bennett made an unbeaten 16 in his team's 287, before taking 2/53 to help dismiss the tourists for 212, securing a 75-run lead. His victims were Gus Logie and the leading batsmen in world cricket at the time, Viv Richards. In the second innings, he made six as the hosts collapsed for 129 to leave the Caribbean visitors with a target of only 205. He took 6/32 in the second innings, his best figures in first-class cricket, including the wickets of opener Desmond Haynes, Richards and captain Clive Lloyd to give NSW victory over the tourists by 72 runs. In the next match, Bennett continued his barren run and went wicketless against South Australia, and was dropped from the state team.  Test selection  At the same time, the West Indies had won the first three Tests against Australia in a dominant fashion, and they had already sealed the series. The selectors brought Bennett into the team despite his lean form overall, because of his match-winning performance against the Caribbean tourists when they struggled against spin in the tour match. The fourth Test in Melbourne saw Bennett make his Test debut over the Christmas holiday period. While not taking a wicket and totalling 0/90 at almost four runs per over without managing a maiden, Bennett made 22 not out in the first innings and survived the final overs of the match with the bat, remaining on 3 at the end. Australia had two wickets in hand to end the West Indies 11-Test winning streak, then a Test record. For the fifth Test at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground, Bennett retained despite his wicketless debut and pair selected for the first time in combination with his NSW spin bowling partner, Bob Holland. The match unfolded in a manner similar to the New South Wales tour match. While Holland was the Player of the Match with 10/94 wickets, Bennett scored 23 and contributed 2/45 and 3/79. In the first innings, he removed wicket-keeper Jeff Dujon to claim his maiden Test wicket before removing Michael Holding for a duck to help finish off the tail. In the second innings, Bennett removed Richie Richardson and then bowled Richards for 58 with an arm ball. Australia won the Test by an innings to end the West Indies' record of 27 Tests without loss. Following his success in the Tests, Bennett was retained for ODIs. He had taken a total of 3/53 from 19 overs in his two domestic one-dayers for the season up to that point. Bennett played in the first five matches in the 1984-85 World Series Cup. In the first match at Melbourne, he bowled an economical spell of 1/23 from his ten overs, his maiden ODI wicket being Gordon Greenidge. Bennett's effort was not enough to stop the West Indies from reaching their target of 241 with seven wickets and more than five overs in hand as they scored quickly from his colleagues. He then returned to his home crowd at the SCG and took 1/44 from his ten overs, removing Brendon Kuruppu before the Australian batsmen completed a six- wicket win over Sri Lanka. In the next match in Brisbane, the West Indian batsmen began to get the better of Bennett after his success in matches earlier in the season. Bennett batted for the first time in ODIs and scored three as Australia were dismissed for 191. He was then attacked by the tourists, who took 21 runs from his three overs en route to a five-wicket win with more than 12 overs in hand. The series proceeded back to Sydney for the next match, but Bennett had no success on his home turf as the West Indies took 40 runs from his six overs and completed another five-wicket win. After taking 0/48 from nine overs in a defeat to Sri Lanka, Bennett was dropped for the remaining 11 ODIs of the Australian summer. He ended the ODI campaign with two wickets at 88.00 and an economy rate of 4.63. Bennett returned to state duty and helped New South Wales complete their second Shield title in three seasons. He scored 22 and took 3/39 in the first innings of an innings win over Queensland. Bennett then played a match-winning role against Victoria. After making 19 of his state's 310, he took 3/47 to secure a 67-run first innings lead. Defending a target of 269 in the second innings, Bennett took 6/57 to secure a close-run 25-run win. In the final, he took 2/54, removing Australian captain Allan Border and future international batsman Glenn Trimble, and then made 10 in the first innings as Queensland took a 56-run lead. In the second innings, he removed Trimble and Test batsmen Greg Ritchie in his 4/32 as New South Wales dismissed their opponents for 163 to set up a target of 220. In a tense finish, Bennett could only manage a solitary run before being dismissed, but New South Wales' last pair reached the target to seal the Shield. Bennett was recalled to the limited-overs team and played his final 2 ODIs in the Four-Nations Cup in Sharjah. In their first match, Australia bowled first against England and restricted their opponents to 8/177; Bennett took 2/27 from his ten overs. Australia found their low run- chase to be difficult and Bennett came out in the closing stages, only to run out for a duck. Border's men scraped home by two wickets on the last ball to reach the final, where they met India. Bennett made a duck as Australia were bowled out for 139 and he took 0/35 from his ten overs as the Indians won by three wickets with more than ten overs to spare.  Dropped from the national team  He was selected for the 1985 Ashes tour to England, but took only three wickets in four first-class matches of the Tests and was overlooked for the opening Ashes match. During June, Bennett was released from the squad to play for Church in the Lancashire League, and he took 11 wickets in two single-innings matches before rejoining the Test team. He only took 12 wickets in his next six county matches, but after taking 1/99 and 4/39 in the last of these games, which helped Australia to a seven-wicket over Kent, he was called up for the final Test of his career at The Oval. Australia were trailing 1-2 heading into the Sixth Test, and a win would have been enough for them to retain the Ashes. Bennett had little effect, taking 1/111 and scoring 12 and 11 as England won by an innings to win the series 3-1. His only wicket was that of Mike Gatting and he ended the tour with only 16 wickets at 47.87 and 111 runs at 15.85 in 11 matches. Initially, Bennett accepted an offer to join the rebel tour to South Africa in 1985‚Äì86, who were banned from international sport because of their policies of apartheid. This would have earned him a suspension from mainstream cricket, but he withdrew at an early stage without financial inducement.‚Äî Bennett was overlooked for national selection during the 1985-86 season and played in all of New South Wales's 11 Shield matches for the season. In the fourth match of the season, he took 4/56 in the second innings against the touring New Zealand, removing John Wright, John Reid, Bruce Edgar and Jeremy Coney. He then played a prominent role in consecutive Shield victories. Bennett made an unbeaten 55 in a rearguard fightback that took New South Wales to 286, before taking 4/47, helping his state to a 99-run first innings lead over Western Australia. The match was eventually won by 151 runs. He then took 4/38 and 3/32 in an innings win over South Australia. In these two matches, Bennett tied down the opposition; 44% of his overs were maidens and he conceded 1.39 runs per over. Bennett later took 4/71 against Victoria and was prominent in an innings win over Tasmania. He scored an unbeaten 57 and took 3/53 and 2/23. Bennett ended the season with 32 wickets at 27.40 and 300 runs at 33.33.  Final domestic seasons  During the 1986-87 season, Bennett's bowling waned. In six Shield matches he took only nine wickets at 49.33 with a best of 3/79 against Western Australia. Although his lower-order batting still yielded 190 runs at 31.66, he was dropped in the latter stages of the season and missed New South Wales' victory in the Shield final. He was selected for only one limited-overs match; he had no success, conceding 34 runs from five overs without taking a wicket. Bennett continued playing for NSW until the 1987‚Äì88 season. His last season was not a success. Playing in only five of the Sheffield Shield matches because of his lack of productivity, Bennett took only four wickets at 43.50 and scored 33 runs at 5.50, and was dropped for the last time in January. He was not selected in any one-day matches. He finished his first-class career with 1437 runs at 23.95 including four fifties and 157 wickets at 30.92. He served as NSW Assistant Coach from 1991‚Äì92 to 1993-94 and as NSW Selector from 1990‚Äì91 to 1996‚Äì97.Australia / Players / Murray Bennett Still heavily involved with the St George District Cricket Club, Bennett served as president for a timeNew South Wales Districts Cricket Association Centenary and the club's talent identification and development program is named the Murray Bennett Pathway.

Rosenberg graduated from Brooklyn College in 1948 and obtained his PhD in Physics at New York University (NYU) in 1956. He joined Michigan State University as a professor of biophysics in 1961 and worked there until 1997. In 1965, Rosenberg and his colleagues proved that certain platinum-containing compounds inhibited cell division and then in 1969 showed that they cured solid tumors. The chemotherapy drug that eventually resulted from this work, cisplatin, obtained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1978 and went on to become a widely used anti-cancer drug. The initial discovery was quite serendipitous. Rosenberg was looking into the effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He noticed that bacteria ceased to divide when placed in an electric field and eventually traced the cause of this phenomenon to the platinum electrode he was using. He was awarded the Chemical Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists in 1979, the Charles F.

It is the 82nd and 83rd episode. This was the 18th and 19th episode for the fifth season. The episode was first shown on NBC on April 28, 1994, and garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for Judge Reinhold. The episode was written by Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Larry David, and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones. The episode's storylines include George trying to weasel his way out of a commitment to the Big Brother program, Elaine's discomfort with her boyfriend's friendliness, Morty scheming to sell boxes of raincoats he designed before he and Helen go on vacation, and Jerry and his girlfriend being caught making out at a theatrical showing of Schindler's List. Plot =Part 1= Jerry's parents are staying with him for three days until they leave for Paris, leaving him yearning for some private time with his girlfriend, Rachel, who lives with her parents. Alec approaches George in Monk's with an offer to join the Big Brother program. George reluctantly agrees to look after young Joey. He asks Helen and Morty to send a postcard to Alec from Paris, so it looks like he is in Paris, thus getting out of the Big Brother program. George invites Morty and Helen over for dinner with his parents, but they claim they have plans for the night. In reality, they can't stand George's parents Frank and Estelle, surprising Jerry. Elaine brings her new boyfriend, Aaron up to the apartment. Aaron is a \\"close talker,\\" standing unusually close to others when speaking to them. Aaron volunteers to escort Jerry‚Äôs parents on a behind-the-scenes tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. After they leave, Jerry phones Rachel, but she is not home. By the time Rachel calls Jerry back, his parents have returned. When Kramer greets Helen and Morty, Morty notices Kramer‚Äôs raincoat, which is the Executive line (a belt-less model, created by Morty years ago). Kramer says they are a hot item at Rudy‚Äôs Antique Boutique. Morty makes plans to get Jack Klompus to send his boxes of unsold Executives up to New York City before he leaves for Paris. When George tells Alec about his invented trip to Paris, Alec replies that this is great news: Joey‚Äôs estranged father lives in Paris but Joey is too scared to fly alone. George goes down to Rudy‚Äôs to sell Frank‚Äôs old clothes, claiming his father has died. Kramer arrives and explains to George how he and Morty went into business over an impromptu dinner; this alerts George that the Seinfelds lied about having plans, which outrages him. Elaine questions Aaron's actions with Helen and Morty, considering them abnormally nice. Aaron takes Elaine to see a stage production of My Fair Lady, and acquires additional tickets for Helen and Morty. Elaine is annoyed at having to share her date with them. George spots the group riding in a buggy and tells his parents the Seinfelds were avoiding them again. When the Costanzas make plans to go on a cruise, Frank realizes his vacation clothes are missing. Rudy sells some of Frank's clothes to Kramer, and burns the rest after discovering them to be moth-ridden. =Part 2= Jerry and Rachel go to see Schindler's List but cannot help making out since they have not been alone in such a long time. Newman, also in the cinema, spots them. Jerry sees Newman as they leave, but he gives no sign of having witnessed them. When Jerry arrives back at his apartment, Helen and Morty quiz him about the film and Jerry bluffs his way through. George goes to Rudy‚Äôs to buy back his father‚Äôs clothes, and is told of their fate. Newman smugly informs Helen and Morty of Jerry and Rachel's making out. When the Seinfelds rebuke Jerry, he realizes Newman must have told. Jack Klompus rings again to tell Morty he had to break a window to get into the garage and that the Executives will be in New York City by 2:00 in the afternoon the next day. Since their flight is at 3:00, Morty decides to cancel the trip to Paris. George asks Jerry for the tickets to Paris, as they are non-refundable. Kramer arrives at the Costanzas' for dinner, where Frank notices Kramer is wearing one of his missing vacation shirts, which forces George to confess that he sold his clothes. Rudy refuses to buy the Executives from Kramer and Morty; after his store was infested with moths from Frank's clothes, he now has a policy of not buying clothes off the street. Frank arrives to buy back his clothes and argues with Morty. At the airport, Jerry and Elaine say farewell to Morty and Helen as they leave to return to Florida. Aaron goes crazy, thinking he could have done more for them while they were in New York City; an allusion to the scene in Schindler's List in which the title character, Oskar Schindler, is in a state of anguish for not being able to do more to help the doomed Jews during the Holocaust. Rachel‚Äôs father forbids her from seeing Jerry again after Newman informs him of their behavior at Schindler's List. Back at Monk‚Äôs, Jerry tells Elaine that his parents were robbed because Jack Klompus never fixed the broken window. Newman comes into the shop and Jerry, angry that he sabotaged his relationship with Rachel, chases him out into the street. George goes to Paris with Joey, who gives him a hard time as they wait for Joey's father to show up. Helen and Morty go on a cruise, but discover that the Costanzas are on the same one. Production Larry David said the idea of making out at Schindler's List \\"must have come from sitting in temple ... thinking what would happen if I reached over and touched my wife's breast now, or something like that. ... You know, I just can't pay attention in there, and so my mind wanders, and I think that's why I put that in.\\" Jerry Seinfeld commented that Schindler's List was specifically chosen because they knew that the film's director, Steven Spielberg, was a fan of the show. The \\"moths\\" in the show were added in post- production. Stephen Pearlman was unable to be present at the audience taping of the episode due to scheduling conflicts, so Larry David stood in for him during the taping of his scene. The audience's laughter from the performance with David was then applied to a later filming with Pearlman for the broadcast episode.

It is well known for having been included in the core fonts for the Web package and distributed with Microsoft Windows since Windows 98. More recently, it has been used extensively in image macros or other Internet memes. Design Lee was an advertising design director and designed Impact with posters and publicity material in mind. Its thick strokes, compressed letterspacing, and minimal interior counterform are specifically aimed, as its name suggests, to \\"have an impact\\". Impact has a high x-height, reaching nearly to three-quarters the capital line. Ascenders are short, and descenders even shorter. With narrow apertures and folded-up letterforms, the lower-case can be quite hard to read printed small, especially for people with vision problems. The face is intended for headlines and display use rather than body text. As a display design, it was not released with an italic or bold weight. During the 1960s, there was a trend towards condensed, bold, \\"industrial\\" sans-serifs like Schmalfette Grotesk and Compacta, largely pioneered by West German magazine Twen, and Impact was intended to fit this trend. Writing in 2004, the year before his death, Lee explained that the design goal was \\"to get as much ink on paper as possible in a given size with the maximum possible x-height\\" and to provide a home-grown metal type alternative to European designs in the style (e.g. Schmalfette Grotesk, illustrated in Lettera, a contemporary anthology series of lettering), which were complicated for British businesses to license and use. Lee wrote that \\"many of us admired the vitality and colour of what we knew only as Schmalfette, and used it by old- fashioned cut and paste. Use was limited as it was never made in metal as far as I know, and existed then in capitals and numerals only\\". (Schmalfette Grotesk was later digitised, with an added lower-case, as Haettenschweiler by Eraman Ltd.) Other designs along the same lines from around the same period included the Letraset face Compacta, Matthew Carter's slightly earlier masthead of Private Eye (which is caps-only but based on a never-released typeface with a lower case), and the phototypesetting Helvetica Compressed, also by Carter and released a few years later. Release Impact was initially promoted with a brochure titled 'The Impact of Impact'. Shown is the front page of Geoffrey Lee's own copy. Released at the end of the age of metal type as phototypesetting gained popularity, it was one of Stephenson Blake's last typefaces released in metal. The design rights were acquired by Monotype, which ultimately licensed the design to Microsoft as part of a package of fonts for use with Windows in the 1980s and 1990s. The original design contained wider alternate forms for the letters 'J' and 'r', intended for letter positions at the start and end of words, which have generally not been included in digitisations. The common digitisation also simplifies the design somewhat, omitting the subtle bevelling of tittles on 'i' and 'j' and flared stroke ends seen on the original metal type release. An eccentricity preserved in the digitisation is the ampersand, which is only as high as the x-height, not the cap height. Lee digitised and self-released a variant, Impact Wide, in 2002 for online sale. This release includes the alternate characters and an italic style. In July 2010, Ascender Corp introduced Impact 2010, an enhanced version with additional OpenType typographic features designed by Terrance Weinzierl and Steve Matteson. These included quirky interlocking characters, text figures and proportional and tabular figures.

It is one of two species in the genus Bambusicola, along with the mountain bamboo partridge of the Himalayas. Long believed to be a relative of Perdix, scientists established that bamboo partridge are close relatives of the long-billed partridge and junglefowl. Description The Chinese bamboo partridge is a small bird, intermediate in size between the Coturnix and Perdix species, reaching a size of 31 cm, with males being slightly larger than females. The breast and back are mottled in black, chestnut, and cream colours, with black spots on the flanks and above. The partridge's face and throat have rich fulvous and rufous tints. The breast is yellow-ochre, with pale greyish blue and taupe above the eye and down to the neck. Like the long- billed partridge, bamboo partridge exhibit well-developed flight feathers. Their tails are broad and squared. The wings are long and narrow. The birds are capable of sustained flight and move from the sub-canopy of steep hillside forest to the forest floor several times throughout the day. Behaviour Like many Galliform bird species, the birds prefer hiding to flight, but will readily flush if approached, startling pursuers with loud wingbeats. Within the forest, bamboo partridge are known to fly uphill, weaving through timber. This is an unusual behaviour, recorded only in the unrelated koklass. Like the related Coturnix species, francolins and junglefowl, males broadcast loud, multi-syllabic calls throughout the day and throughout the year. These vocalisations serve as challenges to other birds as well as location calls and anti-predator alarms. The loud contact call, often rendered as ki-ko-kuai or kojukkei (the latter rendition being adopted as its Japanese name) is repeated several times before slowing to a stop. This call is heard far more than the bird is usually seen, and though the species is common throughout its limited range, it is elusive and secretive. Distribution and habitat The bird is native to eastern mainland China, and has been introduced successfully to Japan, Hawaii and Argentina.Long, John L. (1981). Introduced Birds of the World. Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia, 21-493 It is found in warm forests and grasslands and is not entirely dependent on bamboo, despite its name. The Taiwan bamboo partridge was formerly considered a subspecies. =Introductions= The bird was intentionally introduced first to Japan in 1919, then with varying success to Hawaii, where it is listed as an introduced bird not protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. An introduced population also exists on remote Iwo Jima. Despite its success elsewhere, Chinese bamboo partridge has been extirpated from Hong Kong, and a reintroduction program in 1961 failed to produce a viable breeding population. Chinese bamboo partridge chick two days old Aviculture Chinese bamboo partridges have been part of Chinese aviculture for centuries. In captivity, these tiny birds are pugnacious and care should be taken as to what other terrestrial species should be kept in mixed-species aviaries. They are compatible with crestless firebacks and eared pheasants but not with junglefowl or francolin.

Kerley had his initial radiological training in Vienna at a time when it was the new science. On his return, he completed his studies in Cambridge and took up a post in Westminster Hospital. Here, he worked closely with Sir Clement Price Thomas and also edited a major radiology textbook. Following his early return from India and Singapore during World War II, Kerley continued his work in radiology of the heart and lungs and became radiology advisor to the Ministry of Health. Throughout his working career, he received numerous awards, honours and directorships, going on to achieve royal recognition and worldwide acclaim as one of the best radiologists of his time.  Early life  Born in 1900 in Dundalk, a town between Belfast and Dublin, Peter James Kerley was second- youngest of 14 children. His father was a low income grocer and could not afford Kerley‚Äôs education. However, his uncle, Augustine Henry, a talented arboriculturalist, took charge over this. Medical career Westminster Hospital 1920s Royal chest hospital A graduate of University College Dublin (1923), Kerley spent a year training in radiology in Vienna. His interest in radiology of the heart and lungs stemmed from this new specialty which was still somewhat novel and Vienna at this time was its epicenter. Then travelling to the UK, he achieved the D.M.R.E from Cambridge University and obtained his M.D. from the University of Ireland in 1932. Kerley assisted Seymour Cochrane Shanks to edit a major radiology textbook, 'A Textbook of X-ray Diagnosis by British Authors' in 1939. The first two editions of Recent Advances in Radiology was another later book, Kerley had spent time to organise. He became director of radiology at the Westminster Hospital in 1939 and also became affiliated with the Royal Chest Hospital, London. At the time, Clement Price Thomas was an eminent thoracic surgeon. Kerley and Price Thomas formed a close connection which continued through their careers, influencing and molding Kerley's career pathway significantly. Kerley wrote numerous articles including his celebrated St Cyres lecture, the ‚ÄòRadiology of the Pulmonary Circulation‚Äô and also edited the Journal of the Faculty of Radiologists. Kerley was involved at various times in his career, with the National Heart Hospital, King Edward VII's Sanatorium, Midhurst, the Ministry of Aviation, Shell and Esso. = Heart and lung radiology = Whilst working at Westminster and the Royal Chest Hospital, Kerley published on the X-ray features of early Pulmonary tuberculosis. As well as his 'B lines' in congestive heart failure he also reviewed X-ray changes in congenital lung diseases, congenital heart disease, intrathoracic aneurysm and bronchiectasis. He gave one of the earliest accounts of chest X-ray and contrast, that is bronchography and lipiodol.  King George VI lung surgery  On Sunday 23 September 1951, the thoracic surgical team from Westminster hospital, under the lead surgeon, Clement Price Thomas, resected the lung tumour that was obstructing the king's left lung airways. Kerley was a key figure in the investigations during the king's illness in the days prior to the operation. His review of the X-rays led to the king returning to London from Balmoral and a bulletin stating \\"in view of the structural changes referred to in the last bulletin we have advised His Majesty to undergo an operation in the near future\\". In return, he received a 'New year's honour' in the London Gazette in 1952 which also resulted in Kerley's long term relationship with royalty and a later knighthood. Family Olivia MacNamee was one of the London School of Economics first female students when she met Kerley. They married in 1929. Their two daughters both became doctors. Olivia died in 1973, 6 years before Kerley.  Personality  Kerley had humour and appreciated the outdoors. He particularly enjoyed fishing and would travel to the River Dee to catch salmon. Other pastimes included golf and shooting.  Awards and honours  Kerley received many awards and honours during his working life and after retirement. The Toronto Radiological Society awarded him the R√∂ntgen award in 1944. He received the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1951 and in 1959 he became a member of honour of the Chicago Radiological Society, an honorary fellow of the American College of Radiologists and the Australasian College of Radiology. In 1962 he was made an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Radiologists, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972 in recognition of his services to radiology and as radiologist to the Royal Family. In honour of his presidency, he was awarded the gold medal from the Royal College of Radiologists in 1976. Legacy Kerley b lines Kerley-B-Lines- closer view The Sir Peter Kerley Lecture of the Royal College of Radiologists was named after him. Its funds were later merged to establish the Couch Kerley Travelling Fellowship. He discovered several of the medical signs used in interpreting radiographs. Famous for his 'B' lines, Kerley B lines are a finding of congestive heart failure. These are short parallel lines perpendicular to the lateral lung surface, indicative of increased opacity in the pulmonary septa. Kerley A lines and Kerley C lines are related findings.

Synopsis A patriotic physician Cheng Ying was persuaded to serve the government by his sworn brother, Kung Sun. Emperor Ling was weak and could not control the corrupt minister Tu who seized an opportunity to rid himself of the loyal prime minister, Chao who had resigned in despair over the Emperor's inability to govern. Riding roughshod over the Emperor, Tu had an edict issued that ordered the entire Chao family put to death. The Prince Consort, a Chao scion, was thus ordered to commit suicide by the sword. Physician Cheng knew that Princess Chuang Chi was pregnant, promised to bring the baby away when it was born. He managed to sneak the baby out of the palace when the time came but the evil Tu, who had been waiting for the birth, initiated a hunt for the child. He ordered the next generation of the populace put to the sword unless the child was brought to him. Cheng was caught in a dilemma for it meant his son who was born at the same time, was in peril. He also had to uphold his promise. With grief, he decided to substitute the last surviving member of the Chao family with his own son. Kung Sun proposed a plan to ensure the safety of Cheng and his wife along with the Chao orphan. Thus, another two innocent lives were added to Tu's bloodlist. A pleased Tu then put Cheng under his protection and adopted his baby son as his fosterling. 15 years later, another Emperor ascended the throne. A young Chao Wu met his mother by chance while hunting and was thrown out of the palace when she learnt whom his foster father was. Angered, he stormed off to Cheng to demand an explanation who then revealed to him his true identity and the family tragedy. The time was at hand for General Wu, a loyal official and a friend of the Chao family had returned with the army after 15 years at the borders. Tu was tricked into attending a supposed birthday party thrown by Cheng and was cornered by Wu's soldiers. Chao Wu and his mother took the opportunity to exact their revenge. 12th Asian Film Festival * Best Film * The Most Versatile Talent - Ivy Ling Po Huangmei Opera Vocals * Ivy Ling Po - Chao Wu * Liu Yun - Princess Chuang Chi * Kiang Hung - Physician Cheng Cast * Princess Chuang Chi - Li Li-Hua * Chao Wu - Ivy Ling Po * Physician Cheng Ying - Yen Chun * Madam Cheng - Chen Yen-yen * Kung Sun - Yang Chih- ching * Prime Minister Chao - Ching Miao * Minister Tu - Li Ying Category:1965 films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films Category:Chinese films Category:Huangmei opera films Category:The Orphan of Zhao Category:Films set in the Spring and Autumn period Category:Films set in Shanxi ","title":"The Grand Substitution"},{"id":"3623603","text":"Nong Chok (, ) is one of the 50 districts (khet) of Bangkok, Thailand.

It is southeast of Saxmundham, its post town, and northwest of Aldeburgh. The River Alde bounds the village on the south. The surrounding land is chiefly arable. The soil becomes partly marshy in the lower grounds. The village is noted for its early nineteenth century post mill. It is located next to the village of Knodishall. Its name is recorded in the Domesday Book as Frisetuna and seems to come from Anglo-Saxon Frƒ´sa t≈´n = \\"the farmstead of the Frisians\\"; some of them may have come with the Angles and Saxons. An alternative name for the parish is Freston. In 1887, John Bartholomew described Friston as: > Friston, par. and vil., E. Suffolk, 3 miles SE. of Saxmundham, 1846 ac., > pop. 385; P.O.; in NW. vicinity of vil. is Friston Hall.  Population  According to the most recent census in 2011, the parishes male population was 164 and the female population was 180. The historical reports show that Friston's total population in 1841 was 455 with 210 people being under 20 and 245 people being 20 years and upwards indicating the parishes young population. The population graph from 1801 to 2011 shows an increase in population from 1801 to 1850 where it declined to just under 400 people. After this point the population of Friston fluctuated but continued increasing before the huge decline in the village's population around the 1970s which was common in most rural areas due to people migrating to metropolitan areas with higher accessibility for social and economic activities.  Industry  The 1881 occupational graph demonstrates that the most common occupations for men were in agriculture and commodities with approximately 30 men working in each of these occupations. The second most popular occupation was house construction with 9 men working in that occupation. Females occupations differ in comparison with 17 females employed in domestic services such as transporters of messages and 56 females without specified occupations suggesting they worked around their homes.  Community  Friston is located in a rural area close to the sea, rivers and woodland area. Friston is close to a famous bird sanctuary in Minsmere and is also home to its own wind mill dating back to the 19th century called 'Frison Post Mill'. The village has its own church, called St Mary's Church. The village which once had nine shops has now seen closure to its school and its post office; it is however close to surrounding towns with shops and supermarkets. There are two cinemas and a theatre within four miles of the village. Friston has a village Parish Council which hosts an annual general meeting with its seven members and the clerk. The village has a thriving pub called 'Old Chequers Pub' with a traditional log burner and was referred to as a 'community asset' after fears of it being sold for residential development in 2014.218x218px  Housing  Friston is a desirable location which has meant that there is a big amount of non-residential housing and properties are at a premium. On average a three bedroom semi-detached house costs ¬£375,000 and to rent a two bedroom house costs approximately ¬£700 per calendar month. Friston Population, 1801-2011  Church  The Church at Friston, called St Mary's Church dates back to the Norman period with the main body of the church dating back to the 14th century. The church is built with a nave, chancel, west tower and south porch which is the ideal parish church plan. The Church contains a Tudor Bible written in 1550 and is possibly the first bible to have ever been used in St Mary's church. The church also has a churchyard which has several graves of the Bowater family members, of which three were Lord Mayors of London.Friston Post Mill  Friston Post Mill  Friston post mill was built in 1812 and is the tallest of its type in England. It was said to have been built by John Collins before getting sold to Joseph Colling of Bramfield and then getting sold to John Wells of Halesworth for ¬£40 in 1813. The Mill has been repaired ever since it was built, in 1976 there were 7 major repairs because it was affected by Deathwatch beetle infestation. The Mill was updated in August 1983 and was described as: > Post Windmill, Early C19; partly restored 1977. Timber framed and > weatherboarded body on 3-storey painted brick roundhouse. Fantain and sails > removed. The principal machinery, which drove 3 pairs of millstones, remains > intact. An outstanding landmark.

Since the country's birth in 1958, it has experienced political turmoil, and elections have been called at irregular intervals, and only since 1995 have they been more than the meaningless approval of a one- party state's slate of candidates. The number of seats has also fluctuated. It is currently at 114, with members selected by two different methods.  Organisation  Two thirds of the members (76), called d√©put√©s, are directly elected through a system of proportional representation, using national party- lists, while one third (38) are elected from single-member constituencies, using the simple majority (or first-past-the-post) system. Members must be over 25 years old and serve five-year terms. The President of the National Assembly of Guinea is the presiding officer of the legislature.

Formed in 1977, the SOG was Australia's first full time, and also, dedicated Police Tactical Group. History The SOG was formed in secrecy on 31 October 1977 by Chief Commissioner Mick Miller to establish a group to conduct special operations in regard to counter terrorism that would be directed towards preventative/protective security and combatting operations. Terrorism meaning politically motivated criminal activity as well as other forms of criminal activity which terrorise innocent persons. The first the public was aware of the existence of the SOG was by an article in The Age newspaper in 1980. In 1992, the Nine Network screened a television documentary on the SOG selection course, that included long runs, interspersed with scoffing warm beer and meat pies until the volunteers threw up, to demonstrate how drinking any alcohol while on call, would impair functioning. In 1995, following a review of the SOG as part of Project Beacon, safety-first tactics were introduced along with less-than-lethal equipment with the philosophy that use of force is the last resort. In 1996, the SOG became the first Police Tactical Group to deploy interstate, with ten officers urgently sent to Tasmania via charter plane to assist the part-time Tasmania Police Special Operations Group to respond to the Port Arthur massacre. In 2003, the Bomb Response Unit (BRU) was established with dedicated officers within the SOG which had since inception provided a bomb search and disposal capability to Victoria Police. In 2004, the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) was formed to respond to high risk non-firearms incidents to reduce the SOG workload. Such as a call out in September 1998 when the SOG disarmed a sword-wielding mentally ill man in a two-hour stand off in front of a 2000-strong crowd near Flinders Street station. Earlier in 1995 during the SOG Review, there had been a proposal for two SOG teams consisting of four officers each to patrol Melbourne similar to CIRT. In 2011, the SOG responded to 4 sieges, conducted 10 forced building entries, conducted 54 high-risk arrests and mobile intercepts, and 36 cordon- and-call operations. In 2016, it was announced that the SOG strength would be increased by 20 new officers. Earlier in 2010, the strength of the unit had been cut to expand CIRT. In 2016, it was also announced that the SOG would develop a new capability with their own tactical dogs. The SOG has two nicknames Soggies and the Sons of God, the latter a backronym made from the initials SOG. The unofficial SOG emblem is telescopic crosshairs superimposed over a balaclava-clad head on an outline of Australia. Notable recent incidents include the Brighton siege in June 2017, the fatal shooting of Mohamed Chaouk in April 2005 in Brooklyn, Wayne Joannou in February 2005 in South Melbourne, and earlier the fatal shooting of Norman Leung Lee in July 1992 at Melbourne Airport, the manhunt for Melbourne Remand Centre escapees in March 1993 near Jamieson, resolving a siege at a law firm in Mitcham in June 1996 with tear gas and a siege in Kangaroo Flat in October 1999 in which four uniform officers had been wounded. The SOG was responsible for the security of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The SOG is part of the Security Services Division of the Transit & Public Safety command within Victoria Police. Role The SOG provides Victoria Police with a counter terrorist and high risk arrest response capability. The SOG roles include, but are not limited to:- # Armed offender # Terrorism or significant politically motivated violence # Unplanned operational critical incidents, such as situations involving armed offenders including sieges and hostage situations # Planned operations involving the arrest of dangerous suspects # Undertaking searches of premises in high risk situations (level three) # Bomb related incidents # Covert surveillance or reconnaissance beyond the scope of operational police Training Volunteers for the SOG need to successfully complete a two-week selection course, and if successful, must then successfully complete a 12-week training course. In 2016, it was announced that a new $27 million training facility would be built. Equipment The SOG use a variety of specialised weapons and equipment including the Smith & Wesson M&P; pistol, SIG MCX SBR rifle, Remington 12 gauge shotguns, sniper rifles and 40mm grenade launcher. In July 2018, the SOG took delivery of two Lenco BearCat armoured rescue vehicles, one funded by the Victorian Government and the other purchased by Victoria Police, to replace their older model BearCat. In April 2013, the SOG had taken delivery of a BearCat funded by the Federal Government. The BearCat had replaced a Canadian made Armet Armored Vehicles Balkan Mk7 that had been in service since 2009. The Balkan had replaced their first armoured vehicle, a British made Composite Armoured Vehicle (CAV) 100 Land Rover Defender, acquired in 1995 after being imported for trialling by the Special Air Service Regiment. In 2016, the acquisition of three new ballistic rated vehicles was announced.

Campbell was a right arm fast bowler, and batted as a right-handed tail ender. He is the uncle of former Australian captain Ricky Ponting. Campbell's sister, Lorraine, is married to Graeme Ponting, and Ricky Ponting is their first child. Campbell made his debut in the Sheffield Shield for Tasmania in the 1986‚Äì87 season, playing just one match for the season, before missing all of the matches in the following season. However, in the 1988‚Äì89 season, Campbell gained attention when he took 36 wickets for the season, giving him selection on the 1989 Ashes tour against England. Due to injuries hitting other bowlers, Campbell made his Test debut in the First Test at Headingley in place of Carl Rackemann. However, he was dropped from the Test team for the remainder of the tour due to his lack of performance in that Test, taking 1/124. He took 30 wickets in the tour games at an average of 27. On his return to Australia, he had another good domestic season in 1989‚Äì90, taking 35 wickets, and earning him sporadic Test appearances, playing a Test each against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand. He claimed 12 Test wickets in those matches at an average of 31.58. He achieved his best match figures with 5/143 against Sri Lanka at Bellerive Oval, his home ground, as well as an innings best of 3/79 against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval. He had little batting ability, as evidenced by his average. Campbell was also selected to the ODI team in the 1989/90 season, making his debut against Sri Lanka at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the first match of the triangular ODI tournament. After taking 0/36 on debut, he was expensive in the following match at the WACA Ground, conceding 54 runs, and was dropped. He was recalled for the final two matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively, taking much better figures of 3/31 and 2/46 at the Adelaide Oval and Sydney Cricket Ground to ensure selection for the finals series. He performed well again in the finals, with 3/39 and 1/21 to help Australia win the series 2‚Äì0. This established him in the ODI team, playing in all group matches in the following triangular tournament in New Zealand. He took his career best of 3/17 against New Zealand at Jade Stadium, Christchurch, before another haul of 3/37 in the final at Eden Park, Auckland helped Australia to another victory. However knee and wrist injuries hindered him in the next two seasons, and then a serious back injury led to Tasmania releasing him. He moved to Queensland in 1992‚Äì93 but was unable to secure a place in their side. He is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Cricket PNG, based in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.

The series comprised eight individual versions, all of which sold only in small numbers; across all versions, only 39 locomotives were produced. Each version was produced only for a single railroad. Many shared the same Baldwin model number, DR-6-4-2000, even though they were rather different; this was because the Baldwin model only encoded the total axles (6), the driven axles (4) and the power output (). The single exception was the single unit produced for the Chicago and North Western Railway, which had a single engine and was model number DR-6-2-1000. In the AAR wheel arrangement scheme of classification, these locomotives were of A1A-A1A and A1A-3 arrangements, respectively. Baldwin demonstrators The first produced version comprised a pair of DR-6-4-2000 demonstrators built in 1945. This, unlike later models, used Baldwin's VO engine model. These locomotives had a unique cab that featured the same upright, aggressive prow as the 30 Baldwin C-C units built on a U.S. Army order in 1945 for shipment to the U.S.S.R. as part of Lend-Lease. They emerged as Baldwin #2000 and #2001. After demonstrating on a number of railroads, they were sold to Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (NdeM) and assigned road #6000 and #6001. 608NA-engined DR-6-4-20 locomotives Three different railroads ordered the DR-6-4-2000 model with the 608NA 8-cylinder naturally aspirated engine, but in visually different forms. =CNJ locomotives= CNJ 2000; the first of six \\"Janus\\" DR-6-4-2000 locomotives The Central Railroad of New Jersey ordered six DR-6-4-2000 locomotives, #2000-#2005, which were unusual for North American diesel locomotives in that they had driving cabs at both ends. They were thus nicknamed \\"Janus\\" locomotives, after the two-faced Roman god of the same name. The cab style was nicknamed \\"Babyface\\" and was used by several other Baldwin models. The original paint scheme was a deep, rich blue on the lower part of the locomotive and a golden yellow on the upper part. =GM&O; locomotives= The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad ordered two locomotives, road #280 and #281. These were delivered in a single-ended \\"babyface\\" carbody. =NdeM locomotive= The Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico ordered one additional DR-6-4-2000 unit after purchasing the two demonstrators. This was assigned road #6002 and had nearly identical styling to the demonstrators, but used two 608NA engines instead of their VO power plants. 606SC-engined DR-6-4-2000 locomotives These were produced exclusively for the Pennsylvania Railroad and were delivered in 1948 in the sharknose body style designed by Raymond Loewy, as diesel running mates to the T1 steam locomotive; also built by Baldwin and similarly styled by Loewy. Eighteen A units and nine B units were produced, producing nine three-unit locomotive sets of . The PRR classified them as BP-20 (Baldwin Passenger, ). They were originally used on top-flight express trains such as the Broadway Limited, but problems soon relegated them to lesser service. They ended their days on commuter trains along the New York and Long Branch in New Jersey. A small number were de-rated for use in freight service (re-classified as BF16z).

The show was first broadcast on CBS, on November 11, 1980. It was nominated for an Emmy in 1981 for Outstanding Animated Program. Several years after this film was released, the television series, The World of David the Gnome was created, based on the same book. Plot The movie starts by introducing gnomes in general, and a particular family of forest gnomes who live together in a home under a tree. The family consists of a father, mother, grandfather, older son Tor, and a set of young twins. Tor is about to marry his fianc√©e Lisa, and the gnomes are busy decorating and preparing for the wedding. In the same forest live a family of trolls: a large and stupid troll father, a somewhat more intelligent mother troll (who wears a snake in her hair and smokes a cigar), their two bumbling older sons and a young troll child affectionately called \\"Runt\\". When the father gnome frees the trapped bear cub they had intended to have for their supper, the trolls resolve to get their revenge. The trolls‚Äô intended method of revenge is to set the gnome dwelling on fire, and each member of the troll family marches toward the gnomes‚Äô household, memorably chanting ‚Äúburn, burn, burn‚Äù in unison. Lisa and her parents arrive, carried by a goose from the city. They are \\"house gnomes\\" who live among humans and are the \\"aristocrats\\" of gnome society. Another less welcome arrival is Uncle Kostya from Siberia who crashes the wedding ceremony, adding extra alcohol to Grandpa's punch and making inappropriate advances to the mother of the bride. Their differences are soon forgotten however when the trolls strike. The movie also contains a handful of vignettes, which use still illustrations from the original book and narration to explain some of the facts about the different sorts of gnomes, and what sorts of duties gnomes perform to help the creatures they live among.

The product is applied by placing raw meat pieces in a bag containing the coating, closing the bag, and shaking so the particles adhere. The coated meat is then baked in the oven. First introduced in 1965 by General Foods, it is currently marketed under the Kraft brand.  Concept  Shake 'n Bake mimics the texture on the outside of fried foods and is similar to a bread crumb coating. It provides a baked alternative preparation to that of fried chicken and other fried foods that use cooking oil. Shake 'n Bake has been marketed as a healthierShake 'n Bake Ad and less- greasy alternative to frying, with slogans such as, \\"Shake 'n Bake: It's better than frying\\", and \\"Why fry? Shake 'n Bake\\". Ingredients Shake 'n Bake Original Pork flavor contains the following ingredients: enriched wheat flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamin mononitrate Vitamin B1, riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid), salt, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, sugar, contains less than 2% of paprika, dextrose, dried onions, spice, caramel color, yeast, annatto (color), and natural flavor. Barbecue flavor Shake 'n Bake includes sugar, maltodextrin, salt, modified food starch, spice, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, brown sugar, mustard seed flour, dried onions, dried tomatoes, dried garlic, beet powder (color), citric acid, natural flavor, caramel color, vinegar, and sodium silicoaluminate as an anticaking agent. Advertisements Shake 'n Bake is particularly noted for its television commercials in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, starring such child actors as Carrie Jean Cochran, Carly Schroeder, Taylor Momsen, and Philip Amelio. In the ads, the aforementioned children help make Shake 'n Bake with their mothers, enthusiastically exclaiming, \\"And, I helped!\\" Advertisements for Shake 'n Bake in 1981 included Ann B. Davis, who played Alice the housekeeper on The Brady Bunch. The ad copy includes the catchphrases, \\"Gotta be crispy, gotta be golden, gotta be juicy\\", and, \\"You just shake then bake, and that chicken's so crisp and juicy and golden it makes me look golden, if you know what I mean\\".Shake 'n Bake ad Ann B. Davis (Alice) pitches Shake 'n Bake with \\"Pete the Butcher\\" in this 1981 General Foods ad. In 1990, two commercials were produced which show what pork chops1990 Shake 'n Bake Commercial #1 (Pork) and chicken1990 Shake 'n Bake Commercial #2 (Chicken) look like after frying. They then show that pork chops and chicken are crispier, juicier, more plump, and more tender when used with Shake n' Bake than when fried. They conclude with, \\"Why fry? Shake n' Bake\\". In 1998, a new commercial was tried with a different catchphrase: \\"Mama made Shake 'n Bake, and I helped\\". In popular culture The generic term \\"Shake and Bake\\" has multiple uses in popular culture. Examples in numerous areas are discussed at Shake and Bake. Several examples from arts, entertainment, and media are listed below. =Film= * In the film Aliens (1986), Van Leuwen says of Hadley's Hope: \\"It's what we call a Shake 'n Bake colony.

At the 2016 census, Forrest and the surrounding area had a population of 230. History The railway to the town was opened in 1891 and closed in 1957, as a branch line from Birregurra. It serviced the townships of Deans Marsh, Murroon, Barwon Downs, Yaugher and Forrest. At Forrest numerous tramways ran off into the nearby bush. These lines were used to bring the freshly cut timber to the rail head, and the associated sawmills of which there were 4 in Forrest and nearby Yaugher. All of these mills are now closed. Originally called Yaugher, the name was changed to Forrest when the township was established. The Post Office opened as Yaugher on 27 July 1891 and was renamed Forrest a few weeks later on 15 October 1891. The town football team was established in 1891 and competed in the Colac & District Football League until 2015, eventually folding after struggling to field netball and junior football teams due to lack of available players in the district. Today Consisting of a microbrewery, upmarket restaurant, \\"pub\\", general store, bike hire cafe, guesthouse, and a variety of accommodation rentals, Forrest is the gateway to the Otway Ranges. It is fast becoming a hub for foodies and adventure tourists, which is now the primary economic driver of the town. The West Barwon river flows through the township and it is near the West Barwon reservoir, which services Geelong. During the past few years the town has begun to grow again with an influx of people seeking more affordable blocks of land not that far away from the coastal resorts of Apollo Bay, Skenes Creek, Grey River, Kennett River and Lorne. These can be reached either by a pleasant drive on a sealed main road or by ex-timber blue metal roads. Advice should be sought before motoring on the backroads to Kennett River, Wye River and Grey River. Fauna to be viewed on these drives include Australian king parrots, crimson rosellas, grey swamp wallabies, echidnas. Koalas have in the past been released into the Otways. The Smith Street Band recorded their third album Throw Me in the River in Forrest in July 2014. Mountain biking After the cessation of logging in the Otways, the Government of Victoria made funds available for the creation of dedicated Mountain bike trails in the Yaugher area, in order to replace the logging industry.http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/LinkView/67FB31B7A1749717CA2570AF001A55FD3DACA8D6A22CCF1FCA2570BA007E4B58#Forrest%20Mountain%20Bike%20Project Mountain biking was seen as an addition to the already plentiful eco-tourism industry.

Today she is particularly remembered for her association with Hƒìat≈´n, Anglo-Saxon for \\"high or principal farm or enclosure\\", which she was granted in a charter by King √Üthelred II (√Üthelred the Unready) in 985, and where she endowed a collegiate church in 994. By 1070 this had become known as Wolvrenehamptonia ‚Äì Wolfrun's heaton ‚Äì now the city of Wolverhampton, the sixth largest district by population in the West Midlands. She seems to have also had a close connection with Tamworth, the main centre of royal power in Mercia at the time. It was from here that according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle she was abducted by Danes in 943. Later her son Wulfric Spot left to his daughter the lordship of an estate there that was \\"not to be subject to any service nor to any man born\\", that he may have inherited from Wulfrun; and it is believed that she was buried with the religious community there, to which Wulfric also left land. Her son Wulfric \\"Spot\\" became one of the king's principal thegns in the 990s and an even more extensive landowner than his mother, with holdings in Derbyshire, western Warwickshire, the territories \\"between the Ribble and the Mersey\\", Northumbria, and seven other English counties as well as his inheritance in Staffordshire by the time of his death circa 1002-1004. In his will, which survives, he endowed much of his land to re-found Burton Abbey. Another son, √Ülfhelm, was made ealdorman of Northumbria, in practice southern Northumbria (the area around York), from about 994 until his death in 1006. His daughter √Ülfgifu would go on to be married to Cnut, future king of England, in the wake of his father Sweyn Forkbeard's invasion of England in 1013. √Ülfgifu later played a key role in securing the throne for her son Harold Harefoot in 1036. Wulfrun is known to have also had at least one other child: Wulfric's will contains bequests to the daughter of a sister, √Ülfthryth, who had apparently died before the will was written in 1002. Her lands may have been inherited from Wulfsige the Black,PASE: who was granted lands by King Edmund in 942, some of which correspond with lands later endowed by Wulfrun, and some with lands described in the will of her son Wulfric.For example, the land at Abbot's Bromley Wulfsige may thus have been her father.  Sources  Contemporary knowledge of her comes from several text sources: * Year 943 entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Vikings seized her when they took the fort at Tamworth. [It was in all probability to obtain a ransom.]PASE: ; ASC 943 * Listed as a witness in an Anglo-Saxon charter dated 985, which is listed as no. 650 in Kemble's Codex Diplomaticus √Üvi . In it King Ethelred II ('Ethelred the Unready'), granted to Wulfrun ten hides of land at Hƒìat≈´n, which means \\"high or principal farm or enclosure\\".PASE: ; Charter S860 * It is recorded that in 994 Wulfrun gave ten hides of land to endow a church at a place called Heantune (dative case). This may be the same land as in the previous entry. The church had previously been founded as an abbey by Wulfere.PASE: ; Charter S1380 * The West Midlands placename Wolverhampton seems to have come from Anglo-Saxon Wulfr≈´nehƒìant≈´n = \\"Wulfr≈´n's high or principal enclosure or farm\\", though a local tradition says that King Wulfhere of Mercia was involved in the founding of the town, the church, or both. Older forms of the town's name run against this hypothesis. Many buildings and firms in Wolverhampton are named after Wulfrun, for example, The Wulfrun Centre, Lady Wulfrun (formerly \\"The Goose in the city\\" pub), Wulfrun Hall and the Wulfrun Hotel. It is thought probable that these references all refer to the same woman, Lady Wulfrun. The \\"a\\" commonly seen at the end of her name is a latinisation. = Description of abduction (943) = The relevant Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entries are (from the Worcester manuscript):- *941: Her Nor√∞hymbra alugon hira getreowa√∞a ‚Åä Anlaf of Yrlande him to cinge gecuron. *943: Her Anlaf abr√¶c Tamewur√æe, ‚Åä micel w√¶l gefeol on √¶g√æra hand, ‚Åä √æa Denan sige ahton, ‚Åä micele herehu√æe mid him awegl√¶ddon, √æ√¶r w√¶s Wulfrun genumen on √æ√¶re hergunge.

Here king Edmund besieged Olaf and archbishop Wulfstan in Leicester, and he might have controlled them, except that they broke out of the fort in the night, and after that Olaf had king Edmund's friendship, and king Edmund received king Olaf at baptism, and gave to him royally.

In literature  John of G√†mala was a character from the nineteenth century novel For the Temple by George Alfred Henty. The book depicts him as a heroic figure who fought the Romans, particularly after the latter destroyed the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD. After this event John converted and became a disciple of Jesus. In the book's preface Henty clearly specifies that John of G√†mala is simply his literary creation. Afanasij Ivanovic Bulgakov, the father of Michail Bulgakov, the author of the novel The Master and Margarita and professor of History of Religions at the Theological Academy in Kiev informed his son of having discovered that G√†mala, the homeland of anti-Roman Zealotry, was the true homeland of Jesus, and that the father of Christ was Syrian; in fact G√†mala was located in Gaulanitis, in the southernmost part of Syria. The reference (even if indirect) to Judas the Galilean as father of Jesus is clear. Michail Bulgakov remembered what his father had told him and later included this precise information in his novel, in chapter two dedicated to Pontius Pilate. The first biblicist to identify John of G√†mala as the person who gave birth to the myth of Jesus was Daniel Mass√®. A Frenchman born in 1872 with a degree in law who, after dedicating himself to the study of the historical Jesus, wrote the book entitled L'enigme de J√©sus Christ. Although he does not offer any concrete proof, through analyses of New Testament documents he arrived at the conclusion that the true identity of Jesus corresponded to that of one of the son of Judas of Galilee. The latter was the most famous first century AD Jewish revolutionary and was born in the city of Gamala. In 6 AD he became the head of the national liberation movement (zealotry) aimed at freeing the nation from Roman rule. Mass√® indicated him as being the father of seven sons: John (Jesus), Simon (Peter), James the Greater, James the Minor, Judas, Philip, Menahem. In addition, according to the French biblicist, John, son of Judas the Galilean, was John the Baptist.

Because Harding proved to be unpopular with the territory's Mormon leaders and citizens, he remained at Salt Lake City for less than a year before President Abraham Lincoln appointed him to the judgeship at Denver. In 1865 Harding returned to Indiana, where he practiced law until his retirement in 1881. Earlier in his political career, Harding helped organize the Liberty Party in Indiana and was the party's candidate for lieutenant governor of Indiana in 1843 and 1846, but lost both races. Harding subsequently became a member of the Free Soil Party in 1848 and was an early member of the Republican Party in Indiana in the 1850s. Early years and education Stephen Selwyn Harding, the eldest son of David E and Abigail Harding, was born in Palmyra, New York, on February 24, 1808.David E. Harding's first wife, Abigail \\"Nabbey\\" Harding, died on September 1, 1806, and was buried in Wayne County, New York; his second wife, Abigail Harding (1777‚Äì1857), died in 1857. See: Also: And The Harding family eventually included thirteen children. Stephen's siblings included Laura A. (Harding) Andrews, Myron Holly Harding, Lorenzo Harding, Minerva Harding, Almyra Harding. His half-siblings were Nancy (Harding) Hoyt, Prudence (Harding) Shattuck, and Betsy Harding. In 1820, the Harding family moved to Ripley County, Indiana, which was a frontier wilderness at that time. Although Stephen had only about nine months of formal school training, he was an avid reader. Harding studied law in the office of William R. Morris in Brookville, Indiana, and became licensed to practice law on March 17, 1828, at the age of twenty. Career =Early years= Harding opened a law office in Richmond, Indiana, but he remained there for only six months. As a young and inexperienced lawyer, as well as a newcomer to Richmond, he faced stiff competition from several prominent lawyers in the area that included U.S. Senator James Noble (who later became governor of Indiana) and Oliver H. Smith (who later became a U.S. Senator from Indiana). Harding spent idle time at his law office studying Roman and Greek classics, as well as William Shakespeare's works. In the fall of 1828, Harding took a steamboat from Louisville, Kentucky, to New Orleans, Louisiana, partly to claim personal property of behalf of a client, but also to consider opportunities to establish a law practice in the South. Unable to find employment as a lawyer, he returned to Indiana in the spring of 1829, working his way back home as a clerk on the steamboad Belvedere along the Mississippi River. Harding became an abolitionist as a result of his eight-month trip to the South, where he witnessed first-hand the effects of the slave trade and the slave markets at New Orleans.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 208‚Äì9. =Early Mormon connection= Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1829, Harding left for an extended trip to the East, where he spent the summer in Palmyra, New York. During his visit Harding was an overnight guest at the home of Joseph Smith Sr., the father of Joseph Smith Jr., the founder of Mormonism, a religious movement of which The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest denomination. Harding also met with several early Mormon leaders including Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery. About twenty years after his service as the governor of the Utah Territory, the aging Harding wrote a letter in 1882 that is quoted in The Prophet of Palmyra, an anti-Mormon book, describing his recollection that as a boy, he had seen young Smith Jr. fishing in the same Palmyra mill pond that he has also frequented in his youth. Harding also reported that Martin Harris occasionally visited his parents when the Harding family was living near Palmyra before their migration to Indiana. In addition, nearly sixty years earlier, in 1829, he and Harris listened as Cowdery read from a few of the yet unpublished manuscripts of the Book of Mormon in the candlelight of Joseph Smith Sr.'s log home. Harding also recalled that he had been given the first sheet of the freshly-printed Book of Mormon title page, which he later donated to the LDS Church at Salt Lake City. During his visit to Palmyra, Mormon leaders also asked Harding to become a Mormon missionary in London, England, but he declined the request and returned to Indiana in late 1829.Gregg, pp. 38‚Äì53.French, ‚ÄúStephen S. Harding,‚Äù p. 210. =Indiana lawyer and abolitionist= Harding opened a law practice in Versailles, Indiana, in December 1829,Dunn, v. 1, p. 512.A Biographical History of Eminent and Self-Made Men of the State of Indiana, p. 78. and by 1830, was an active abolitionist. He began delivering anti-slavery speeches at gatherings near his home in southeast Indiana,French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" p. 212. which included active pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions. In the 1830s and 1840s, Harding's interest in the anti-slavery issue continued to increase and as he became a leader in the abolition movement in Indiana. Harding, who believed that slavery was unconstitutional, had anti-slavery views similar to other moderate abolitionists such as Salmon P. Chase, William Jay, Joshua Reed Giddings, and James G. Birney; unlike those of radical abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 201 and 216. Indiana historian Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. reports that the Harding home in Milan, Indiana, was used as a station on the Underground Railroad.Dunn, v. 1, p. 513. Even though his views on slavery were not popular in some of the areas where he spoke in Indiana, Harding continued to deliver anti-slavery speeches. Harding, a subscriber to several anti-slavery journals, was well-informed on the issue. In 1844, he predicted in a speech he gave at Versailles, Indiana, that twenty years later slavery would not exist in the United States.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 217‚Äì18. =Indiana politician= Harding, a Whig, left the party in 1840 to join the Liberty Party. He was nominated as the Liberty Party's candidate for lieutenant governor of Indiana in 1842 and 1846, but lost both races.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 215, 220, and 221. In 1844, Harding served as a presidential elector of the Liberty Party's candidate, James G. Birney.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 222‚Äì23. After the Liberty Party had dissolved by 1848, Harding joined the Free Soil Party. In July 1848, while Harding attended the national Free-Soil convention in Buffalo, New York, the Free-Soil Party of Indiana was established at Indianapolis. Harding was among the speakers at the Free-Soil Party's second state convention in Indianapolis. Representing the 4th Congressional District, Harding was also one of eleven presidential electors on the Free-Soil ticket in 1852. In 1854, Harding aligned himself with the People's Party, the predecessor to the Republican Party in Indiana, and was among the leaders who addressed a People's Party meeting on July 12, 1854, the day before the party was officially organized in the state. Harding joined the Republican Party because of its platform, which opposed polygamy, as well as the expansion of slavery. Harding promoted the Republican Party's platform in Indiana, and in 1860 became one of sixteen members of the Indiana Republican Party's state central committee.French, \\"Stephen S. Harding,\\" pp. 225‚Äì27.Seeds, v. 1, p. 31. =Governor of Utah Territory (1862‚Äì63)= At the recommendation of Indiana politicians Schuyler Colfax and George Washington Julian, Abraham Lincoln appointed Harding governor of the Utah Territory in 1862. The U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment without a dissenting vote on March 31, 1862. Harding began his overland journey west in May arrived at Salt Lake City to assume his new duties on July 7, 1862. His tenure at the territorial governor was marked by conflicts with Mormon politicians, especially with Brigham Young, the former territorial governor and head of the LDS Church, and the territory's Mormon residents. Harding was unable to enforce federal law in the territory due to the conflicts with the Mormons. Soon after he took office he issued a blanket pardon for all Morrisites convicted in connection with the Morrisite War. He also initially tried to appease the Mormon community but soon became critical of church leaders and the practice of plural marriage (polygamy). In his first message to the territorial legislature In December 1862, Harding defended an anti-polygamy act recently passed in the U.S. Congress and described his intention to challenge Mormon dominance in Utah. Harding's relations with the Mormons further declined after he approved of efforts to limit the jurisdiction of the Mormon-controlled probate courts and to transfer control of the militia to the territorial governor. In March 1863, after a mass meeting was held in Salt Lake City to discuss the issue, territorial citizens petitioned President Lincoln to remove Harding from office, but instead of recalling him, Lincoln appointed Harding to the post of U.S. consul at Valpara√≠so, Chile. Harding resigned the position as territorial governor in fall of 1863, intending to accept the diplomatic post, but due to his wife's ill health and other domestic reasons, he had to resign the appointment on the eve of his departure to Chile.A Biographical History of Eminent and Self-Made Men of the State of Indiana, p. 80.Tegeder, p. 89. =Chief Justice of Colorado (1863‚Äì1865)= Lincoln appointed Harding to serve as Chief Justice of the Colorado Territory's Supreme Court in July 1863,Footnote 6 in and remained in that position until May 1865.The Indiana Historical Bureau's state historical marker notes indicate that he served until December 31, 1865. See: Footnote 6 in One of his responsibilities as Chief Justice was to serve as a committee member responsible for certifying the results of ballots cast in 1865 to request that Colorado be admitted as a state in the Union. Believing that the results had been altered in favor of statehood, Harding refused to approve the results.A Biographical History of Eminent and Self-Made Men of the State of Indiana, pp. 80‚Äì81. =Later years= Harding left Colorado in 1865 and resumed his private law practice in Indiana. He retired from practicing law in 1881 due to blindness. Personal life Stephen Harding married Avoline Sprout of Chautauqua County, New York, on October 31, 1830. They were the parents of nine children (five sons and four daughters), including Selwyn Stephen Harding (1831‚Äì1913); Attilius C. Harding (1836‚Äì1837), and Mucidor (Harding) Hillis (1840‚Äì1903). Harding died on February 12, 1891, at Milan in Ripley County, Indiana, and was buried in the Greendale Cemetery at Greendale, Indiana. Notes References     * External links *The Manuscripts of S.S.

Housman, focusing specifically on his personal life and love for a college classmate. The play is written from the viewpoint of Housman, dealing with his memories at the end of his life, and contains many classical allusions. The Invention of Love won both the Evening Standard Award (U.K.) and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (U.S.) Considered by many to be Stoppard's finest play, it has been called \\"esoteric\\". In fact, to demystify the play's many historical and academic references, the New York production team provided the audiences with a 30-page booklet on the political and artistic history of the late-Victorian period. Harold Bloom, a scholar of Walter Pater, contended that the character of Housman and those in his circle are fabulated for dramatic effect, and the play's difficulties are not historical but its own. This clarified, he cited it in 2003 as Stoppard's \\"masterpiece to date\\". Synopsis The play begins with A. E. Housman, dead at age 77, standing on the bank of the river Styx. About to board the ferry to the afterlife ‚Äì captained by a petulant Charon ‚Äì Housman begins to remember moments from his life, starting with his matriculation at Oxford University, where he studied Classics. The play unfolds in short scenes that trace, primarily, Housman's relationship with Moses Jackson, for whom he harboured a lifelong unrequited love. The scenes also explore late-Victorian artistic ideals, and Housman's intellectual growth into a preeminent Latin textual scholar. Throughout the play, the older Housman comments on and occasionally talks to the characters, including his younger self. Production history The play premi√®red at the Cottesloe Theatre in the Royal National Theatre, London, on 25 September 1997, moved later into the larger Lyttelton Theatre, and then transferred to the Haymarket Theatre in 1998. The old Housman was played by John Wood and the young Housman by Paul Rhys. The director was Richard Eyre.RNT premiere The production won the 1997 Evening Standard Award for Best Play.Evening Standard Award Retrieved on 8 October 2009 The play premiered in the U.S. at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater in 2000. The play opened on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre on 29 March 2001 and closed on 30 June 2001.

Sharknose is a term applied by railfans to the styling of several cab unit diesel locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works to the specifications of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The styling was by the PRR's preferred designer, Raymond Loewy, with the distinctive nose reminiscent of his design for the PRR T1 steam locomotive. Pennsylvania Railroad Locomotives commonly known as \\"sharknoses\\" include: * Baldwin DR-6-4-20, otherwise known as the \\"Passenger Sharknose\\" or \\"Passenger Shark\\" * Baldwin DR-4-4-15, otherwise known as the \\"Freight Sharknose\\" or \\"Freight Shark\\", along with the: * Baldwin RF-16 Other railroads While the passenger models were unique to the Pennsylvania Railroad, other railroads purchased and operated the freight models, including the New York Central, Baltimore and Ohio and Elgin, Joliet & Eastern. The New York Central was the last original owner to operate the engines, selling the last of them to the Monogahela Railway for $6,000 each in late 1967. By 1972, all but two of them, the 1205 and 1216, had been scrapped. The final pair also were sold for scrap in 1974, but were rescued from the torch by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, which at the time was also operating the world's last four Alco PA-1 passenger locomotives. The pair were purchased by Castolite Corp. in 1978, which leased them for use on the Michigan Northern. Both engines have purportedly been stored out of public view on the property of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad for more than 20 years. Automobiles The name \\"sharknose\\" has also been given to streamlined automobiles of the 1930s and 1940s, because of their design, first introduced in 1936 on the 1937 Willys passenger cars. Willys continued to manufacture them in this design until the beginning of World War II. The term was applied to the 1938 Graham- Paige \\"Spirit of Motion.\\" The design was also used on the 1941 Nash, as well as 1940s Hudson models. The last automobile with this design was the 1947 Hudson. Many classic BMWs from the 1960s to the 1980s were also designed with a pronounced nose that is commonly referred to as a shark nose.

It is expected to crash back to Earth between 2023 and 2025. Its landing module, which weighs , is highly likely to reach the surface of Earth in one piece as it was designed to withstand 300 G's of acceleration and 100 atmospheres of pressure. Beginning in 1962, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly four minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation. Kosmos 482 was launched by a Molniya booster on March 31, 1972, four days after the Venera 8 atmospheric probe and may have been similar in design and mission plan. After achieving an Earth parking orbit, the spacecraft made an apparent attempt to launch into a Venus transfer trajectory. It separated into four pieces, two of which remained in low Earth orbit and decayed within 48 hours into south New Zealand (known as the Ashburton balls incident), and two pieces (presumably the payload and detached engine unit) went into a higher orbit. An incorrectly set timer caused the Blok L stage to cut off prematurely, preventing the probe from escaping Earth orbit. At 1:00 AM on April 3, 1972, four red-hot titanium alloy balls landed within a radius of each other just outside Ashburton, New Zealand. The spheres scorched holes in crops and made deep indentations in the soil, but no one was injured. A similarly shaped object was discovered near Eiffelton, New Zealand, in 1978. Space law required that the space junk be returned to its national owner, but the Soviets denied knowledge or ownership of the satellite. Ownership therefore fell to the farmer upon whose property the satellite fell. The pieces were thoroughly analyzed by New Zealand scientists which determined that they were Soviet in origin because of manufacturing marks and the high- tech welding of the titanium. The scientists concluded that they were probably gas pressure vessels of a kind used in the launching rocket for a satellite or space vehicle and had decayed in the atmosphere.

The city of Murray, Utah was named for him. Murray had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War as colonel of the 3rd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment. He was brevetted to the rank of brigadier general when the war ended. In the next year he was appointed U.S. Marshal for Kentucky and stayed on that post for 10 years; afterwards managing a Kentucky newspaper. Murray was appointed Governor of Utah Territory in 1880. The newly appointed anti-Mormon territorial governor openly supported the Liberal Party of Utah. Thus, the 1880 territory-wide election for a congressional delegate unexpectedly proved the closest that the Liberal Party got to sending a representative to Washington, D.C. The Liberal candidate, Allen G. Campbell ‚Äì with 1357 votes ‚Äì lost resoundingly to Mormon General Authority George Q. Cannon who had 18,567 votes. However, before Governor Murray certified the election, a protest on behalf of Campbell was filed. The protest listed a dozen claims, chiefly that Cannon, born in Liverpool, England, was an un-naturalized alien. The protest also claimed that Cannon's practice of polygamy was incompatible with the law and a delegate's oath of office. Murray agreed and issued certification to Campbell in spite of his poor showing. Cannon, in Washington at the time, argued that only Congress could decide on a member's qualifications. He furthermore received a certificate from sympathetic territorial election officials which stated he had received the most votes. This document convinced the House of Representatives clerk to enter Cannon's name on the roll, so Cannon began drawing delegate's salary. Both Murray and Campbell traveled to Washington to dispute the seat. Each side battled over the position for over a year, even through the assassination and eventual death of President James Garfield. On February 25, 1882, the House of Representatives finally rejected both candidates. The House refused Cannon his seat not for his dubious citizenship, but for his practice of polygamy. The entire ordeal brought unfavorable national attention to Utah regarding the \\"Mormon Question\\" (polygamy).

Reference to this period as Canada's Hundred Days is due to the substantial role that Canadian Corps played during the offensive. During this time, forming part of the British First Army, the Canadian Corps fought in the Battle of Amiens, Second Battle of the Somme, Battle of the Scarpe, Battle of the Canal du Nord, Battle of Cambrai, Battle of the Selle, Battle of Valenciennes and finally at Mons, on the final day of combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. In terms of numbers, during those 96 days the Canadian Corps' four over-strength or \\"heavy\\" divisions totalling roughly 100,000 men, engaged and defeated or put to flight elements of 47 German divisions, which represented one quarter of the German forces faced by the Allied Powers fighting on the Western Front. However, their successes came at a heavy cost; Canadians suffered 20% of their battle-sustained casualties of the war during the same period. The Canadian Corps suffered 45,835 casualties during this offensive. Background The German Spring Offensive, which began with Operation Michael in March 1918, had petered out by the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918. By this time the German superiority of numbers on the Western Front had sunk to a negligible lead which would be reversed as more American troops arrived. German manpower was exhausted. The German High Command predicted they would need 200,000 men per month to make good the losses suffered. Returning convalescents could supply 70,000‚Äì80,000 per month but there were only 300,000 recruits available from the next annual class of eighteen-year-olds. The German failure to break through at the Second Battle of the Marne, or to destroy the Allied armies in the field, allowed Ferdinand Foch, the Allied Supreme Commander, to proceed with the planned major counteroffensive at the Battle of Soissons on 18 July 1918. By this point in time, the American Expeditionary Force was present in France in large numbers and invigorated the Allied armies. Likewise, the British Expeditionary Force had also been reinforced by large numbers of troops returned from the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Italian Front and replacements held back in Britain by the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. Foch agreed on a proposal by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, to strike on the Somme, east of Amiens with the intention of forcing the Germans away from the Amiens‚ÄìParis railway. Battles =Battle of Amiens= The allied command had developed an understanding that the Germans had learned to suspect and prepare for an attack when they found the Canadian Corps moved in and massed on a new sector of the front lines. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George reflected this attitude when he wrote in his memoirs: \\"Whenever the Germans found the Canadian Corps coming into the line they prepared for the worst.\\" A deception operation was devised to conceal and misrepresent the Canadians position in the front. A detachment from the Corps of two infantry battalions, a wireless unit and a casualty clearing station had been sent to the front near Ypres to bluff the Germans that the entire Corps was moving north to Flanders.Blaxland p. 161 Meanwhile, the majority of the Canadian Corps was marched to Amiens in secret. Allied commanders included the notice \\"Keep Your Mouth Shut\\" into orders issued to the men, and referred to the action as a \\"raid\\" rather than an \\"offensive\\". To maintain secrecy, there was to be no pre-battle bombardment, only artillery fire immediately prior to the advance. The plan instead depended on large-scale use of tanks to achieve surprise, by avoiding a preliminary bombardment, a tactic successfully employed at the Battle of Hamel.Blaxland pp. 146‚Äì149 The battle began in dense fog at 4:20 am on 8 August 1918. Under Rawlinson's Fourth Army, the British III Corps attacked north of the Somme, the Australian Corps to the south of the river in the centre of Fourth Army's front, and the Canadian Corps to the south of the Australians. The French 1st Army under General Debeney opened its preliminary bombardment at the same time, and began its advance 45 minutes later. The operation was supported by more than 500 tanks, which helped to cut through the numerous barbed wire defences employed by the Germans. The first day of the attack, August 8, saw the attacking forces break through the German lines in dramatic fashion, with the Canadians pushing as far as from their starting points. In many places the fog provided good cover for their advances in and through the furrows of the valley of the Luce river which ran through the centre of the Canadian's portion of the battlefield. The tanks were successful in this battle, as they attacked German rear positions, creating panic and confusion. The swift advance led to a rapidly spreading collapse in German morale that ultimately led Erich Ludendorff to dub it \\"the Black Day of the German Army\\" when he was told of the psychological impact on his men. Continuing to press the advantage gained on Day One, the advance continued for three more days but without the spectacular results of August 8, since the rapid advance outran the supporting artillery that could not be repositioned as quickly as the infantry advanced. By the 10th of August, the Germans had been forced to pull out of the salient that they had managed to occupy during Operation Michael in March, back towards the Hindenburg Line. Left without an enemy to fight or a plan to pursue the retreat the Allied advances in the Amiens sector including those of the Canadians petered out by 13 August and the Amiens operation was halted. The Canadians remained on the scene at Amiens until 22 August, consolidating their gains and prepared to defend against counter-attack. On the 23rd they were summoned to pull out and go into the line east of Arras for an attack that was to commence three days later. There they were stationed in the villages of Fouquescourt, Maucourt, Chilly and Hallu from which they would attack eastward toward the Hindenburg Line. At Amiens the four Canadian Divisions faced and defeated or put to flight ten full German Divisions and elements of five others that sat astride their boundaries with the Australians and French on either side of them. In the five earnest days of fighting between the 8th and 13 August the Canadian Corps captured 9,131 prisoners, 190 artillery pieces, and over 1,000 machine guns and trench mortars. The deepest extent of penetration from their jumping off points was approximately 14 miles or 22.5 kilometres, and in total the Canadians liberated an area of more than 67 square miles/173.5 square kilometres which contained 27 towns and villages. =Breaking the Hindenburg Line= In Arras, the Canadians attacked eastward, smashing the outer defence lines near the powerful Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line (the Wotan Stellung section of the Hindenburg line), along the Arras-Cambrai road. On September 2, 1918, the Canadian Corps smashed the Drocourt-Qu√©ant line, and broke its main support position, taking 5,622 casualties, which brought the total losses of the Arras-Cambrai operation up to 11,423 casualties. After this, the Germans retreated across the Canal du Nord, which was almost completely flooded. Canadian troops shelter in a ditch along the Arras-Cambrai road.At the Battle of the Canal du Nord, following up the first breaking of the Hindenburg line, the Canadians used a complex manoeuvre to attack along the side of the canal through an unfinished dry section. The Canadians built bridges and crossed the canal at night, surprising the Germans with an attack in the morning. This proved the ability of Canadian engineers to construct new roads to cross the canal efficiently without the Germans noticing. The specialisation of troops and formally organised battalions of combat engineers was also effective as it allowed the soldiers to rest instead of working every day that they were not actively attacking. The Canadians then broke the Hindenburg line a second time, this time during the Battle of Cambrai, which (along with the Australian, British and American break further south at the Battle of St. Quentin Canal) resulted in a collapse of German morale. This collapse forced the German High Command to accept that the war had to be ended. The evidence of failing German morale also convinced many Allied commanders and political leaders that the war could be ended in 1918. (Previously, all efforts had been concentrated on building up forces to mount a decisive attack in 1919.) =Pursuit to Mons= As the war neared its end, the Canadian Corps pressed on towards Germany and the final phase of the war for the Canadians was known as the Pursuit to Mons. It was during these final thirty-two days of the war that the Canadians engaged the retreating Germans over about seventy kilometres in a running series of battles at Denain and Valenciennes in France and finally Mons in Belgium where they pushed the Germans out of the town on November 10‚Äì11. Mons was, coincidentally, where the British had engaged the German armies for the first time in battle in the Great War on August 23, 1914. As such, Mons is considered by some to be the place where the war both began and ended for the British Empire. Some criticism was leveled at Canadian Corps commander Arthur Currie by Sam Hughes and others for needlessly wasting lives to capture Mons once it was known that the armistice was imminent. They claimed the soldiers who were killed and wounded in taking Mons were sacrificed for not a strategic, but a symbolic objective. The allegations even appeared in print in newspapers run by Hughes' family which led to Currie launching and winning a libel lawsuit against Hughes' son Garnet and others after the war. Legacy and memorials Three war memorials stand in commemoration of the actions of the Canadian Corps during the Hundred Days Offensive. The Le Quesnel Memorial commemorates the 1918 Battle of Amiens, the Dury Memorial commemorates the Battle of Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line and the Bourlon Wood Memorial commemorates the Battle of the Canal du Nord and the subsequent advance to Mons. Further, the Canadian Corps liberation of Mons is commemorated on a plaque that is on display in the entrance of the City Hall of Mons, just off of the Grand Place.

It is commonly called wood anemone, like Anemonoides nemorosa, a closely related European species. It has previously been treated as a subspecies of Anemone nemorosa. Description The leaf has three leaflets, but appears to have five. It is a perennial herbaceous plant, growing in early spring to tall, and dying back down to the root-like rhizomes by mid summer. The rhizomes spread just below the soil surface and grow quickly, contributing to its rapid spread in woodland conditions, where it can carpet large areas. The flower has five (occasionally four, or six to nine) petal-like segments (actually sepals) that are long and wide. The flowers are usually white, but sometimes pink, or with a pink base and white tip, or with a white base and a pink or blue tip. The leaves are in three parts with deeply lobed lateral leaflets, giving the appearance of five leaflets. The leaf veins are branched and not parallel. Taxonomy It was first formally named as Anemone quinquefolia in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum. He described it as having leaves with five oval serrated parts; hence the species epithet quinquefolia, meaning \\"five-leaved\\". It is part of a species complex that includes A. grayi, A. lancifolia, A. oregana, and A. piperi. =Varieties= The Flora of North America and The Plant List accept two varieties: * A. quinquefolia var. quinquefolia ‚Äì grows over the entire species range * A. quinquefolia var. minima ‚Äì grows only in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia The two are distinguished mainly by the size of the achene (the fruit), the body of which is in A. q. var. minima as compared to in A. q. var. quinquefolia.

OBU was established in 1910 under the original name of The Baptist University of Oklahoma. OBU is owned and was founded by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma (BGCO). History Three life-size bison Sculptures - NE corner of campus Prior to the creation of the Baptist University of Oklahoma by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma in 1910, several other Baptist-affiliated schools were started in Oklahoma Territory. Oklahoma Baptist College in Blackwell began operation on September 4, 1901. The school fought financial problems throughout its history and closed in 1913. In the fall of 1907, the Baptists of Hastings, Oklahoma, Comanche County, Oklahoma and Mullins Baptist Associations opened Hastings Baptist College in the southwestern part of the state. A year later, the name was changed to Southwest Baptist College and then to Southwest Baptist Academy. It suffered similar financial challenges and ceased operation in 1912. Baptists in nearby Mangum were able to pay off debts of Southwest Baptist College and move the school to their city. It was reopened in the fall of 1912 in the First Baptist Church building and was called Southwestern Baptist College, then Western Baptist College. It was closed in 1915.http://www.okbu.edu/100/centennial_history.pdf A commission to plan the founding of a Baptist university in Oklahoma was established by the Baptist Convention in 1906 (one year prior to Oklahoma statehood) while in session in Shawnee. At the second annual meeting of the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma (BGCO) at Ardmore in November 1907, the Baptist Education Commission unanimously passed a resolution stating its sense that \\"as soon as practicable a new Baptist University be established\\". A board of trustees was elected soon thereafter in 1907. A site for the university was sought, and from 1908‚Äì1909 negotiations were held with entities in El Reno, Lawton, Chickasha and Oklahoma City without reaching agreeable terms. At the 1910 annual meeting of the BGCO in Enid, the trustees reported that Shawnee had been selected as the site of the new university and that an incorporation certificate for \\"the Baptist University of Oklahoma\\" had been issued by the State of Oklahoma on February 9, 1910. The school's Board of Trustees then signed an agreement with the City of Shawnee for sixty acres of land northwest of the town. The Kickapoo site, as the campus location became known, was deeded to the university by the Development Company of Shawnee. Shortly after the campus location was finalized, W.P. Blake, chairman of the trustees, and G. Lee Phelps, missionary to the Native Americans, visited the future building site. They gathered and arranged twelve stones, commemorating God's leadership of the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Promised Land. Plans for the administration building had been drawn and a contract for construction of the building had been signed on June 3, 1910. The total estimated cost to construct, equip, and furnish the building was $140,000. The trustees reported that the City of Shawnee \\"through its development company, gave to the denomination sixty acres of land worth $1,000 per acre and a cash bonus of $100,000\\". Dr. J.M. Carroll, San Marcos, Texas, was selected as the school's first president and construction on an administration building commenced in February 1911.Stained glass window in Raley Chapel The university opened in September 1911, holding classes for 150 students in the basement of the First Baptist Church and in the Convention Hall of Shawnee. Students came from other universities and preparatory schools, and at the close of the 1911‚Äì12 school year nine students received degrees. Included in the first student body were three men who later served as United States Senators: Josh Lee and Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma and Huey P. Long of Louisiana. A general depression in the State in 1911 however had a negative effect on the finances of the BGCO, as well as the development company that had promised the $100,000 cash bonus, which it was unable to deliver, and construction on the Administration Building was halted. After the completion of the first school year in 1912 Dr. Carroll resigned and recommended that operations of the school be temporarily suspended. His recommendation was adopted and the university was placed in a period of \\"suspended animation\\" while further organization and fund-raising progressed. The report submitted by the Board of Trustees to the BGCO annual meeting in 1914 discussed the need for completion of the construction of the administration building and recommended the convention \\"begin at once to provide for the equipment of the building and make other necessary provisions for the opening of school in September, 1915\\". Frank M. Masters, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Ardmore and a member of the BGCO's Education Commission, was selected by the school's Board of Trustees as the president who would re-open the university. The Administration Hall (renamed Shawnee Hall in the 1920s) was finally completed in September 1915 in time for the re- opening. The university reopened for the fall 1915 semester with a total enrollment of 143; with about a third of them ministerial students. OBU has been in continual operation in Shawnee since that time. The name of the university was officially changed to \\"The Oklahoma Baptist University\\" in 1920. In 1915, Shawnee Hall housed faculty, staff, classrooms, library, an auditorium which doubled as a gymnasium, and the women's dormitory. Shawnee Hall did not house male students, as they were housed in two privately owned off-campus homes, known as \\"Hill Hall\\" (located half of a block south of the intersection of Kickapoo and MacArthur streets) and \\"Douglas Hall\\" (located on south University street where Bailey Business Center now stands). Shawnee Hall did not provide enough space for women's housing, therefore, in 1916 ground was broken on a new dormitory for women. The new residential unit was opened in 1917 and named Montgomery Hall, in honor of Dr. and Mrs. D.M. Montgomery, who provided significant financial support for the project. Montgomery Hall served as a dormitory, the fine arts center, the student center, and the location for administrative services. The original Montgomery Hall was located between Shawnee Hall and WMU Memorial Dormitory on the campus oval. The building was removed in 1989 due to structural concerns and a new Montgomery Hall was located on south University street west of the Bailey Business Center. From 1919 to 1928, campus facilities consisted of three buildings, Shawnee Hall, Montgomery Hall, and the combination men's dormitory and gymnasium. In the mid 1920s under the leadership of Berta K. Spooner; Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the Oklahoma Women's Missionary Union, Baptist women of Oklahoma recognized the need for a new dormitory for women on Oklahoma Baptist University's campus. After a fundraising effort to procure sufficient financial support for the new dormitory, groundbreaking occurred in 1927 for the new facility. When WMU Memorial Dormitory opened in 1928, the building housed rooms for 200 female students, the university dining hall, parlors, assembly rooms, a recreation room, an infirmary, and a swimming pool. Due to the challenges of \\"The Great Depression\\" in the late 1920s to the 1930s, it would be another decade before another building was constructed on campus. Oklahoma Baptist University served as an army aviation training site from February 1943 through the summer of 1944, hosting the 91st College Training Detachment. Cadets lived in WMU Dormitory, attended classes in Shawnee Hall, drilled on the campus oval, and exercised on the athletic fields. During the time of the U.S. Army attachment during World War II, approximately 2,000 cadets were trained during the sixteen months of OBU retaining military detachment. According to John Wesley Raley, OBU's president during that time, \\"OBU's participation in the military program provided several benefits: Satisfaction that the university had participated in the war effort; favorable advertising through the cadets who had been on campus; the ability to maintain a strong faculty, despite the decline in regular enrollment which had dropped to 326 in 1943, the smallest enrollment since 1918; the maintenance and enlargement of the physical plant; and operating without a deficit during a 'most difficult period for colleges'\\". Although the university participated in the war effort during World War II, the university does not have an active ROTC program at this present time. Total annual enrollment in the university exceeded 1,000 for the first time in 1946. OBU was officially racially integrated in 1955, when the Board of Trustees approved a motion by Dr. Herschel H. Hobbs, pastor of Oklahoma City's First Baptist Church, to allow African American students admission to the university. In January 1964, during final examinations week, the school narrowly missed disaster when a man flew a small airplane into Shawnee Hall. The man had been hospitalized for mental health problems but had been released and was able to rent a plane in Tulsa. He radioed the Shawnee airport and reported that he was going to fly his plane into OBU's administration building. Authorities evacuated Thurmond Hall, which had been the university's administration building since 1954, and moved students to Shawnee Hall, the primary classroom building. Shawnee Hall had been the administration building prior to 1954. The pilot then flew his plane into one of the few empty classrooms in the building and when the plane crashed into room 307, the students made a calm and orderly exit. The pilot was killed and the exterior impact area along with two classrooms were badly damaged. None of the 300 students, faculty, or other staff were injured. Today, Shawnee Hall bears the scars of this incident. Although all damage has been repaired, the brick and mortar on the south side of the building is discolored in one area on the third floor when Shawnee Hall is viewed from the campus oval. Enrollment passed 2,000 for the first time in 1989 and a record enrollment of 2,440, with 2,011 on campus, was set in 1994. In 1999, acquisition of land north of the campus enlarged OBU property from 125 to approximately . Under President Mark Brister, by 2005, the university's endowment exceeded US$80 million. In 2007, OBU's International Graduate School opened in Oklahoma City, offering a master's of business administration degree. Acquisition of 10 additional acres of land at the southwest edge of the campus in 2008 increased OBU's property to , and in 2010, the university celebrated its first centennial. =Presidents= * James M.

On February 20, 2012, The OBU Graduate School announced plans to relocate from Oklahoma City's Triangle District to the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma building, located at 3800 N. May Avenue in Oklahoma City, in May 2012. The Graduate School has been located in the Momentum Building at 111 N. Harrison in downtown Oklahoma City since January 2007. The move will not affect the time frame of the existing cohorts in the Graduate School's programs. Dr. Scott Harris, director of the OBU Graduate School, cited the reasoning behind the move as more classroom space for existing and future programs, easier access in Oklahoma City concerning location (near Interstate 44 and Lake Hefner Parkway), and other educational endeavors. =Colleges and divisions= * College of Arts and Sciences: Division of Language & Literature, Division of Behavioral & Social Sciences, Division of Science & Mathematics, Division of Kinesiology & Leisure Studies, Division of Teacher Education * Herschel H. Hobbs College of Theology and Ministry * Paul Dickinson School of Business * School of Nursing * Warren M. Angell College of Fine Arts: Division of Music, Division of Communication Arts, Division of Art & Design * OBU Graduate School = Core Curriculum = As a liberal arts university, OBU offers a substantial core curriculum. In addition to courses on the Bible and in science, all students take courses in OBU's distinctive Western Civilization sequence, which includes a Freshman-level course on ancient Greek literature and culture and then the sophomore-level, twelve credit hour, team-taught courses on the history and literature of the Western world from the Roman republic to today. The purpose of the Western Civilization sequence has been stated by faculty member, Dr. Benjamin Myers: \\"Knowledge of Western civilization‚Äîa true knowledge of its change and continuity over time‚Äîgives the student room to breathe intellectually, morally, spiritually, and emotionally. It frees the student from the tyranny of the moment, from merely fashionable, inevitably superficial ways of being in the world. Life in the fullness of time is a life more abundant than living in the prison of the moment.\\" =Faculty= For the 2009‚Äì2010 academic year, OBU employed 113 full-time faculty members. 71% of the faculty possessed the highest degree available in their field. No classes are taught by graduate assistants. The student to faculty ratio is 15:1. Campus Raley Chapel =Location= OBU is located in northwest Shawnee, Oklahoma. The OBU campus, referred to as \\"Bison Hill\\" because a majority of the university is located on a small hill, contains over 30 buildings on . The campus is bordered by N. Kickapoo Street to the east, W. Midland Street to the south and N. Airport Drive to the west. W. McArthur Street runs through the north side of the campus, with the main campus lying south of the street and residential and athletic areas to the north. In December 2018 the sale to Hobby Lobby of the Shawnee campus of the bankrupt St. Gregory's University, located at 1900 West MacArthur, was approved by the bankruptcy court. The campus, less than a mile to the west along MacArthur from the main OBU campus, was leased to OBU. In May 2019, OBU renamed the former St. Gregory's property the \\"OBU Green Campus\\" both in honor of the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, and in reference to the color green, one of the university's official colors. In December 2019, Hobby Lobby and the Green family donated the campus to OBU. The former St. Gregory‚Äôs Abbey and College campus is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. =Major buildings= Major campus buildings include the Art Building, Bailey Business Center, Ford Music Hall, Geiger Center, Jent Alumni Center, Mabee Learning Center (composed of a renovation of and an addition to the university's former library building, W.L. Brittain Hall, and the faculty office building, Owens Hall), Montgomery Hall, the Noble Complex, John Wesley Raley Chapel, Andrew Potter Auditorium, Shawnee Hall (the original 1915 administration building), Stubblefield Chapel (erected in 1894 and moved to the campus in 1963), Sarkeys Telecommunication Center, Thurmond Hall, the W.P. Wood Science Building, and‚Äîon the OBU Green Campus‚ÄîBenedictine Hall. Art Building Refurbished in 2001, the Art Building is located at the northwest corner of Kickapoo and Midland Streets. The refurbished art facility includes two faculty offices, an art gallery, photography lab, a general classroom, a computer graphics art lab, a weaving and stained glass lab, and a ceramics lab. The art department also uses a facility adjacent to the art building to house drawing and studio art classes. Bailey Business Center Constructed in 1993, the building on University Drive directly south of the campus oval is named in honor of William S. Bailey, a Tulsa philanthropist and business director. Ford Music Hall Ford Music Hall Constructed in 1951, the building is located on south University Drive directly west of Gold Star Park, southeast of the campus oval. Geiger Center Constructed in 1970, the Geiger Center is located east of Raley Chapel and north of Kerr Residence Center. The center was originally named \\"University Center\\" until 1982, when the building was renamed the \\"Albert J. and Laura Belle Geiger Center for University Life\\". On-campus dining is provided in the Laura Scales Cafeteria, located in the upper level of the Geiger Center. Coffee and quick service dining is available at Java City and the Geiger Counter, located in the lower level of the Geiger Center. The Geiger Center also houses the mailroom, copy center, OBU Bookstore, meeting rooms, special dining areas and information desk, as well as a prayer room. The offices of the Dean of Students, Events/Camps/Conferences Director, Director of Residential Life and Campus Activities, Student Government Association and the Student Services Center are located in the Geiger Center. The Student Services Center includes Career Planning Services, Testing Services, Special Services, Counseling Services, and Student Health Services. Jent Alumni Center Constructed in 1937, the building was named for John W. Jent, an early OBU administrator and philosophy professor. It originally was an apartment building for faculty, known as \\"Jent Apartments\\". Sometime after World War II, it later became a dormitory for male students and in 1988, it became the \\"Jent Alumni Center\\", which houses development and alumni offices. Mabee Learning Center In 1918, work began on a combination men's dormitory and gymnasium and the building was completed in 1919. Most of the dormitory was located on the east end of the building, now known as Owens Hall. The gymnasium was used until 1941, when a new gymnasium was opened. The old gymnasium was converted into the W.L. Brittain Learning Center in 1946, and in 1976, became a part of the Mabee Learning Center. The university's primary library is located in the Mabee Learning Center (MLC). The collection of resources contains more than 184,724 bound volumes, 534,429 microform holdings and approximately 10,050 other media materials. The Learning Center also subscribes to several online indexes (Psyc. Info, MLA Bibliography, CINAHL, ATLA Religion Index, WorldCat, etc.) and full-text databases (EbscoHost, Academic Elite, Literature Resource Center, Biography Resource Center, InfoTrac Expanded Academic, NetLibrary, NewsBank, Electric Library, General Business File ASAP, Health Reference Center-Academic, etc.). It also subscribes to 450 print periodical/newspaper titles. The MLC is a United States government documents depository. Also located in the MLC is the Herschel Hobbs Baptist History and Heritage Center, containing the personal library, manuscripts, and memorabilia of Dr. and Mrs. Herschel Hobbs. Other archival collections include the B.B. McKinney music collection, the E.C. Routh Library of Missions, and the J.W. Storer collection related to the American Civil War and World War II. Owens Hall is also located on the east side of Mabee Learning Center. When the new gymnasium was constructed in 1941, Owens Hall, still a men's dormitory, was added to the gymnasium that was remodeled as W.L. Brittain Library. In the 1970s, Owens Hall was remodeled from a dormitory into faculty offices, which is what the building addition is now. Montgomery Hall Constructed in 1989, the building is named for Dr. and Mrs. D.M. Montgomery. The building is located west of the Bailey Business Center on south University Drive, south of the campus oval. The building replaced the earlier Montgomery Hall, which was constructed in 1917 southwest of Shawnee Hall on the campus oval. Due to structural problems, that building was demolished in March 1989; it was replaced with the current Montgomery Hall, which houses a campus ministry center and various classrooms. Dr. John Wesley Raley Chapel Constructed in 1961, the chapel is, from the top of the spire to ground, tall. As a result, the chapel's spire can be seen from several miles away on a clear day and is usually used as a symbol of OBU. The chapel was named in honor of Dr. John Wesley Raley, longest serving president of OBU, from 1934 to 1961, then serving as Chancellor of OBU, until his death in 1968. Raley Chapel is home to two separate auditoriums. The Andrew Potter Auditorium has a seating capacity of 2,000 and features the 56-rank Van Deren Memorial Organ. On the lower floor, the W.R. Yarborough Memorial Auditorium seats 400. The Mabee Fine Arts Center in Raley Chapel houses music classrooms, studios, rehearsal rooms, and the office of the Dean of the College of Fine Arts. Among the instruments in Raley Chapel is the McGavern Harpsichord, a two-manual French instrument constructed in 1974. Along with the auditoriums, there are several classrooms on the northern side of Raley Chapel, including a small banquet hall named in honor of Helen Thames Raley, wife of Dr. John Wesley Raley. On December 21, 2011, work began on the windows in the spire of Raley Chapel. AT&T; reached an agreement with OBU to install a cell phone antenna in the chapel's spire. The existing glass and aluminum framing could potentially interfere with the antenna transmission, leading to the replacement project. Raley Chapel in summertime Raley Chapel veranda Shawnee Hall Construction began on Shawnee Hall in 1911, but was not completed until 1915, when the school re-opened from its \\"suspended animation\\" period. The building was named in honor of the city of Shawnee, who donated the original and a $100,000 cash bonus to the university. It was originally the administration building until 1954, when Thurmond Hall was constructed. Shawnee Hall occupies the northernmost point of the campus oval and houses classrooms along with the Cleo L. Craig-Rhetta May Dorland Theatre.Shawnee Hall Stubblefield Chapel Stubblefield Chapel, named for Cortez Stubblefield (1848‚Äì1930), early Oklahoma Baptist pastor and 20-year associate to Oklahoma Baptist University, is located on south University Drive, southeast of Kerr Residence Hall, and directly west of Montgomery Hall. The building, originally the First Christian Church of Shawnee until 1953, was the first meeting house of Shawnee's First Baptist Church and was first erected at 207 N. Union Street in downtown Shawnee. Baptist General Convention of Indian Territory (formed in Tahlequah in 1883), antecedent to present Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma, met in this building for its final session on November 9, 1906, and merged with Oklahoma Baptist State Convention (Oklahoma Territory) later that same day to found the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma. The chapel was re-located to its current location on OBU campus in the fall of 1963 and formally dedicated by the senior class of 1964 to the university on February 20, 1964, OBU Founder's Day. Because of its picturesque nature, colorful stained-glass windows, and seating accommodations, it has become a popular building in which to conduct weddings, banquets, and other ceremonies. Sarkey's Telecommunication Center Sarkey's Telecommunication Center was built in 1941 and is located directly north of the Geiger Center. In 1941, a new gymnasium was opened called \\"University Gymnasium\\". The building was the home of the basketball team until the opening of Bison Fieldhouse in 1948. From 1948 on, the building was used as an intramural gymnasium, auditorium, theater annex, and physical education building until 1986, when the building was heavily remodeled. The building still stands today as Sarkey's Telecommunication Center and houses classrooms, conference rooms, offices, and a small theater. Thurmond Hall Thurmond Hall was constructed in 1954 and is located on the northeast corner of the campus oval, southeast of Shawnee Hall. In 1987, Thurmond Hall was renovated to accommodate a computer lab and the Williamson School of Nursing. Thurmond Hall is the OBU Administration building that includes classrooms and a large computer lab. W.P. Wood Science Building The W.P. Wood Science Building was constructed in 1985 and is located on the southeast corner of the campus oval, north of the intersection of Kickapoo Street and University Drive. The building was named in honor of W.P. Wood, a Shawnee businessman. The lead gift of the building came from W.P. Wood Trusts. The building is composed of classrooms, the science department of OBU, and a chemistry lab.Overview Members of the OBU community celebrated groundbreaking for a new student residential village on May 10, 2012, during an afternoon ceremony. The total complex will include 204 new apartment units, 782 beds and 20 laundry facility-safe rooms on Bison Hill. OBU trustees, students, faculty, staff and Shawnee community representatives gathered for the ceremony at the site of the planned buildings, north of OBU's MacArthur Apartments on the north side of MacArthur Street. When completed, the proposed housing complex will include six large apartment buildings, one small apartment building and a centrally located clubhouse building attached to another large apartment building. The initial phase of the village construction includes two housing structures which feature contemporary apartment units to accommodate 194 students. Each apartment unit will feature four individual bedrooms, two bathrooms and an open floor plan including a kitchen, dining area and living area. Some of the apartments will include a washer and dryer, while others will share laundry facilities on the first floor which also double as safe rooms to be used in severe weather threats. OBU hired CJC Architects Inc., a Tulsa firm which has worked with the University on several major projects, to plan the construction of the complex. Occupancy of the first phase of the apartments is projected for the fall 2013 semester. Nearly 100 individuals attended the groundbreaking activities. Representatives from the student body, the local community, OBU trustees, faculty, staff, and architect and construction representatives took turns shoveling dirt at the site. Benedictine Hall With the OBU Green Campus acquisition, OBU inherited Benedictine Hall. Construction on the imposing, five-story, Tudor Gothic‚Äìstyle structure began in 1913. The facility was damaged in 2011 by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake, but several million dollars in donations enabled the reconstruction of the building's towers. =Monuments and sculptures= While many universities have monuments to commemorate certain events in their respective lore and history, OBU has acquired many monuments in its 100-year history. Some of these monuments are class memorials donated for the beautification of the campus and some are donated from private, outside groups and churches. * The sundial and pergola in front of Shawnee Hall, gifts from the class of 1922, remain the first ever-recorded senior gifts from a graduating class. * In 1927, the senior class donated and built a brick and mortar archway sidewalk entrance located on the northwest corner of Kickapoo and University Streets. The Class of 1954 donated and built another brick and mortar archway on the southwest corner of the intersection, completing the east entrance of the campus. * The Class of 1932 donated the bison statue and pedestal that stand on the northern part of the campus oval, directly south of Shawnee Hall. The bison statue is painted gold and the pedestal is made of brick and mortar with several other small bison adornments and a granite plaque commemorating the Class of 1932..OBU Campus oval * The Class of 1935 donated and began a rock wall on OBU at that time. The wall, at its largest, extended from where Kerr Residence Hall sits, heading east until bending north from the intersection of University Street and Kickapoo, heading west along the southern side of MacArthur Street, completing at its terminus near MacArthur Street and Airport Road. In 2010, portions of the wall had to come down as a result of the widening of Kickapoo Street. As of 2012, the only portion of the wall that remains standing is the segment along the north side of University Street. Along with the rock wall, the class also donated a group of hedges which when viewed from the intersection of Kickapoo and MacArthur Streets, the hedges spell out \\"OBU\\". * In 1938, the senior class of that year donated and built a fountain at the center of the campus oval. However, over the many years, the fountain fell into disrepair and eventually stopped working altogether. In 1991, the senior class of that year decided to restore the fountain to its original state. Working in conjunction with surviving members of the Class of 1938, the senior class of 1991 was able to raise the needed funds for the campus oval fountain's restoration. As of 2012, the fountain is in perfect working order and lights are fitted inside the fountain so that when viewed at night it alternately glows green and gold.Groundhog Day blizzard of 2011 * The Class of 1945's class project was to build a memorial to the members of the OBU family who had perished in World War II. On, May 24, 1945, \\"Gold Star Park\\" was dedicated to OBU from the Senior Class of 1945. The monument stands today directly east of Ford Music Hall southwest of the intersection of University and Kickapoo streets. On the memorial is an inscription that reads, \\"Honoring Bisons 'Who more than self their country loved and liberty than life'\\". Each year, U.S. Military veterans from OBU and elsewhere gather at \\"Gold Star Park\\" on the anniversary of the dedication of the memorial to lay a wreath and for the playing of \\"Taps\\". This World War II memorial is believed to be one of the earliest memorials constructed in the state. * Although there is almost no physical trace on the OBU campus proper of the university's participation in training soldiers during World War II, there remains one noticeable artifact. East of the intersection of Franklin Street and Airport Road, directly north of the Eyer building, there are two 6-foot-tall concrete square columns that once served as the checkpoint for the U.S. Navy Air base, which now serves as Shawnee's airport. The square columns are painted red, white, and blue and are adorned with a frieze of a golden- painted eagle on a blue background on both east and west sides. As of today, the square columns serve as one of the few reminders of OBU and the city of Shawnee's participation in the war effort. * In 1948, the charging bison roadside plaque at the Storer Lane entrance to the university, was installed. The small drive, located on the west side of the Agee Residential Center, is named for Dr. James Wilson Storer, receiver of an honorary doctorate in 1939. The monument itself is about 6.5 feet tall and is located near MacArthur Street on Storer Lane. * In 1952, the quadrangle clocktower was erected directly west of Shawnee Hall. The clocktower is around 25 feet tall, made of brick, mortar, iron, and concrete, features water fountains (fountains not working), and a concrete frieze of a charging bison facing each cardinal direction. The class of 1994 restored the quadrangle clock tower and added park benches. * In 1956, an outdoor bulletin board was added. This class gift now stands as brick benches outside of WMU Memorial Dormitory. * In 1983, the Peitz Plaza, named for Lawrence Peitz, was dedicated. The plaza, located between Raley Chapel and the Geiger center, features two small fountains, a rock waterfall, urban-style park benches, and several small trees. In 2010, a life-sized fiberglass statue of a bison, which features a colorful display of various artworks painted on the statue, was added onto the plaza. * The Class of 1993, donated a new sign at the corner of Kickapoo and MacArthur directly southwest of the \\"OBU Hedges\\". * A gazebo and park, located directly west of Stubblefield Chapel, were added on University Drive by the Class of 1996, and the campus signage project was provided by the Class of 1997. The Class of 1998 built the legacy wall, and the Class of 1999 continued the campus signage project. The Class of 2000 created Millennium Park, north of the campus near Taylor Residence Center, and the Class of 2001 provided the marble cross in front of Raley Chapel. * The class of 2002 began work on the Truth Walk project, which was completed in 2004. The project includes granite stones engraved with scriptures, located directly south of Shawnee Hall and north of the bison pedestal. * On August 1, 2011, a bronze statue of James R. Scales was dedicated on the Oklahoma Baptist University campus in his honor. The statue features Scales dressed in university academic regalia and rests on a brick podium, making the entire monument around , altogether. The statue is located on the campus quadrangle, directly southwest of Shawnee Hall. Peitz Plaza =Residential life= OBU requires all unmarried students under 21 years of age to reside in university housing. The university operates one residence hall (Agee Residence Center) and three apartment complexes (East Devereaux, MacArthur and Midland) for men, and three residence halls (Woman's Missionary Union, Kerr, and Howard), one suite complex (Taylor) and apartment complexes (Howard Apartments, and West University) for women. Three apartment complexes are provided for married students (Burns, Cobbs and West Devereaux). Athletics Oklahoma Baptist (OBU) teams, nicknamed athletically as the Bison, are part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II primarily competing in the Great American Conference(GAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and track and field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball.

As of July 11, 2014, the NCAA Division II Membership Committee recommended the membership application for the institution to set up the move from the NAIA to NCAA Division II, primarily competing in the Great American Conference, effectively the 2015‚Äì16 season. =Facilities= * The Noble Complex Completed in the summer of 1982, it is a building which houses a 2,400-seat arena, the Mabee Suite, which accommodates events for up to 150 people, an athletic heritage center, and classrooms and offices for the division of kinesiology and leisure studies. Additionally, the Noble Complex houses a large varsity sports weight room. * Basketball and volleyball The Bison and Lady Bison basketball teams play home games along with the volleyball team in the Mabee Arena in the Noble Complex. Opened in 1982, the Noble Complex underwent a major renovation prior to the 2007‚Äì08 season, adding new locker rooms, basketball offices, court-side wireless Internet, the Mabee Suite, and new scoreboards. The Mabee Arena seats around 2,400 people, including chair-back seating in the lower reserved sections. * Soccer The Bison and Lady Bison soccer teams play at the OBU Soccer Complex, located north of the main campus on Raley Drive. The OBU pitch includes bleacher seating and covered dugouts. In addition to the main pitch, the complex includes a practice field. * Baseball In 2008, the Bison baseball team relocated to \\"Bison Field at Ford Park\\", located on the north side of campus at the end of Raley Drive. The field was named in honor of J. Lloyd Ford, founder of the Shawnee Milling Company, and the Ford family, which has long ties to the university. The field includes covered dugouts, fenced outfield bullpens, a pressbox, and metal bleachers on a concrete slab. There is also a Junior Varsity field located to the southwest of the Coates Baseball/Softball Building, where the baseball team is lockered and officed. * Softball Lady Bison Softball Field, at the north end of Raley Drive, includes metal outfield fences, scoreboard, press box, covered dugouts, a covered patio, bleacher seating on a concrete slab, public restrooms, storage area and an umpire dressing room. The Lady Bison have lockers and offices in the Coates Building, which also includes an indoor hitting facility. * Swimming and diving The men's and women's OBU Natatorium is an Olympic-size swimming pool located in the RAWC and can be used for swim and dive meets, water polo, and swim lessons for children, along with general swimming. The pool is temperature controlled and utilizes a salt water chlorination system. On March 9, 2012, Ivan Maciuniak, a member of OBU's NAIA champion 2012 men's swim team, drowned in the pool.\\"Ivan Maciuniak, 22, dies after swim\\", Associated Press at ESPN.com, March 12, 2012. * Tennis The OBU Tennis Complex includes eight courts on University Street, south of the Recreation and Wellness Center. The courts were professionally resurfaced in the summer of 2011. The university plans to create a new tennis complex in the near future near the soccer fields. * Track Eddie Hurt Jr. Memorial Track Complex Oklahoma Baptist University opened its new track, the Eddie Hurt Jr. Memorial Track, just west of the old track in 2008. The track hosted the 2008 Sooner Athletic Conference Championships and is being improved daily. The track and field and cross country teams are housed in the Jay P. Chance Track Building, at the northeast corner of the intersection of University Street and Airport Road. * Recreation and Wellness Center (RAWC) The OBU Recreation and Wellness Center (RAWC, pronounced \\"rock\\") was completed in 2007 and includes cardio and weight machines, a rock climbing wall, an indoor running track, three basketball-volleyball courts, three racquetball courts, a swimming pool, and a snack bar-lounge. The RAWC is home to many campus intramural sports, which include basketball, bowling, Flag Football, Free Throw Shooting, racquetball, Sand Volleyball, softball, tennis, volleyball, and Ultimate Frisbee. Front entrance to RAWC * Clark Craig Fieldhouse Located where the RAWC is at the present time, Clark Craig Fieldhouse originally served as a military recreational facility at Camp Maxey in Paris, Texas, during World War II. It was purchased, moved, and reconstructed on the OBU campus in 1948. Clark Craig Fieldhouse was the home of the Bison basketball team during the years the team reached three successive NAIA championship games, winning the national title in 1966. The teams moved into the OBU Noble Complex's Mabee Arena beginning in the 1982‚Äì83 season and Clark Craig was used primarily for intramurals and as an indoor training facility for OBU's spring sports. After years of athletic services, Clark Craig Fieldhouse was in deteriorating condition and on January 26, 2006, Clark Craig Fieldhouse was demolished to make way for the RAWC. =Recent sports at OBU= On December 16, 2010, Oklahoma Baptist University president David Whitlock announced that football, lacrosse, and varsity swimming teams would be added to the list of athletics. Beginning with swimming and lacrosse in 2012, and football in the fall semester of 2013, the number of intercollegiate sports played at Oklahoma Baptist University is 21 sports, 10 men's teams and 11 women's teams. This marks the first time since 1940 that Oklahoma Baptist University has fielded a football team. On January 18, 2012, OBU announced the hiring of Chris Jensen to become head coach of the university's revitalized football program. Jensen comes to OBU from Southmoore High School, where he started the football program in 2008. In his and the program's second year, the SaberCats were 11‚Äì2 and reached the Class 6A semifinals. Jensen was named Oklahoma 6A-1 Coach of the Year in 2009. Jensen's coaching stops also include assistant posts at Westmoore (defensive coordinator), Bartlesville (offensive coordinator), Durant (offensive coordinator and assistant head coach), Moore (offensive line) and Little Axe (offensive line and outside linebackers). =Rivalries= Oklahoma Baptist University has several rivals throughout the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC). Before the closure of St. Gregory's University, which was about a mile west from Oklahoma Baptist University on MacArthur Street in Shawnee, OBU had a rivalry with that school. As a result of the religious affiliations of both universities (St. Gregory's being a Roman Catholic institution), some sports writers referred to the athletic contests as \\"The Holy War on MacArthur Street\\". Although considered to be more of a basketball rivalry, the rivalry spilled into other sports such as baseball and soccer. Traditions =School colors= green and gold coreopsis OBU's school colors of green and gold were chosen by students in the first year of classes because the school's future campus of of green prairie located northwest of downtown Shawnee was covered with wild golden coreopsis. =Mascot= Before OBU was established, what is now known as \\"Bison Hill\\" was a buffalo wallow prior to the establishment of the university. OBU founders nominated the American Bison as a school mascot because they hoped that graduates would help meet the needs of the world as the bison met the many needs of the Native Americans. The bison was selected as the school mascot in 1918, and The Bison student newspaper was first published in December of that year. The bison statue and pedestal on the Oval were donated by the Class of 1932. In 1962, a student organization, known as \\"The Sacred Order of the Bison\\", brought to the campus a live bison mascot, which they named \\"Belshazzar\\". Belshazzars I, II, III, and IV lived in a pen near the fieldhouse and athletic fields and members of \\"The Sacred Order of the Bison\\" were responsible for the care of the mascot. However, in 1974, due to concerns from \\"The Sacred Order of the Bison\\" and students alike, Belshazzar IV was released from the confines of the campus pen and allowed to roam on a semi-natural ranch near Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Since 1974, Oklahoma Baptist University has had no live animal mascot. The university does have a male and a female student dress in bison mascot-animal costumes at some athletic and other special events. The newest addition to the mascot-animal costume, which previewed in the spring semester of 2013, became known as \\"Shaz\\". Students voted to name the bison mascot on the website at www.okbu.edu. The name of \\"Shaz\\" originated from a shorter form of Belshazzar, which was the original Bison mascot's name. =\\"Ka-rip!\\"= The \\"Ka-Rip\\" spirit chant was introduced by Fred McCaulley (Class of 1920) in 1918. It is repeated often and rapidly by OBU fans during sporting events, and memorization of \\"Ka-rip!\\" is an important part of OBU new student orientation. =School song= \\"Hymn to Alma Mater\\" became the official school song in 1939. Dean Warren M. Angell composed the music and Mary Ann Tisinger wrote the words. =Welcome Week, Beanies and The Walk= \\"Welcome Week\\" is OBU's program of orientation for all new students prior to the start of the fall semester. New students are given a green and gold beanie that is worn throughout welcome week, taught the Ka-rip! spirit chant and the school song, and introduced to college life. Students also engage in a \\"Serve Shawnee\\" service project. On the night before classes begin, new students participate in \\"The Walk\\" from the Oval to Raley Chapel, mirroring the walk taken on graduation day. Beanies and the traditions concerning them have varied over the years, but the tradition of recognizing and welcoming new students to campus has been revived yearly for over 90 years. The tradition began in the 1919‚Äì1920 school year when the incoming freshmen students were the first to wear the beanies and the beanies were worn for a full year as a sign of penance. By 1925, the OBU student handbook stated that freshmen were required to wear their \\"Greencaps\\" on campus from the beginning of fall semester until Thanksgiving. In 1933, the student handbook said that freshmen were required to wear the \\"Greencaps\\" until the final home football game. At halftime of the final game, freshmen were permitted to burn their beanies. In 1968, freshmen were supposed to wear beanies between 7 o'clock a.m. and 11 o'clock p.m. while on campus during \\"Welcome Week\\". If the freshmen won the \\"Freshmen- Upperclassmen Tug-O-War\\", then they could dispose of their beanies. If they lost the contest, then they had to wear their beanies for another week. =Hanging of the Green= The \\"Hanging of the Green\\" is an OBU Christmas tradition that dates back to 1937 and is held on the first Friday in December to commemorate the holiday season. The events include a formal dinner, a musical production featuring familiar religious and secular Christmas carols, a dramatic production, honoring of senior students, and the adornment of Raley Chapel with wreaths, Christmas trees, and other Christmas ornamentation. The program has been varied through many years, but has always included Christmas greenery and honoring senior students. The first \\"Hanging of the Green\\" ceremony was held in 1937 in WMU dormitory. During that ceremony, students sang Christmas carols and hung ornamental Christmas wreaths around the building. Afterwards, the students took a candle from that ceremony to each of their respective residence halls. In 1945, the ceremony was moved to the W.L. Brittain Library and Fine Arts Center (now the Mabee Learning Center). In 1957, the ceremony was moved to the University Auditorium (now Sarkey's Telecommunications Center). With the completion of Raley Chapel in 1961, the \\"Hanging of the Green\\" moved to Potter Auditorium. 2011 will mark the fiftieth consecutive \\"Hanging of the Green\\" held in Raley Chapel's Potter Auditorium. In addition to the \\"Hanging of the Green\\", various other buildings and trees are decorated before Christmas. =Abandoned traditions= Freshmen orientation and \\"Welcome Week\\" were once unofficially known as \\"Freshmen Initiation\\". Freshmen were required to wear name tags and \\"Greencap\\", bow before upperclassmen, and memorize and recite \\"Bison Orientation Police\\", \\"Hymn to Alma Mater\\", \\"Ka-Rip\\", and a poem known as I am a lowly freshman. The \\"Freshmen-Upperclassmen Tug-O-War\\" occurred the first week of \\"Freshmen Initiation\\". Preparations for the tug-of-war included: Watering the soil and ground where the freshmen were to stand for the contest, greasing the freshmen end of the rope, beginning the contest with upperclassmen of small stature, and gradually replacing them with much larger upperclassmen. The upperclassmen always emerged from the contest victorious. \\"Freshmen Initiation\\", \\"Freshmen- Upperclassmen Tug-O-War\\", and \\"Bison Orientation Police\\" were eliminated in the 1980s and replaced with \\"Welcome Week\\". Events hosted at OBU * OBU annually hosts the OSSAA State 1A, 2A, and 3A Vocal Contest. The majority of contest activities take place in Raley Chapel, where numerous high school choirs and ensembles warm-up and perform for contest judges. * OBU, over the course of the past few years, has held a two-day camp in preparation for the OMEA (Oklahoma Music Educators Association) High-School All-State Chorus auditions. Usually this event takes place the second or third weekend in July. *OBU also hosts a Christian youth camp called Super Summer every year for the first three weeks of June and is attended by youth groups from everywhere in the United States. Campus organizations OBU recognizes more than 150 campus organizations with various interests and purposes, including student government, involvement, academics, music and arts, politics, social service, sports and religion. =Student Government Association= There are two branches of OBU's SGA: executive and legislative. The executive branch is headed by the Student Body President. The President is elected on a ballot open to the entire student body near the end of the spring semester. Anyone who is at least a junior and has a 3.0 grade point average is eligible to run for President or Vice President (see legislative section). The President works directly with the Board of Trustees and the University President. The SGA President also holds the power to sign bills for passage, or veto them. Along with the President is the Vice-President, who runs on the same ballot, the Speaker of the Senate, the Attorney General, and the Chief of Staff. Those three are appointed by the President and Vice-President, who are then approved by the Senate. The legislative branch is made up of elected senators from the student body. They hear bills and resolutions that can range from chartering official clubs on campus to allocating money for student activities. Five Senators are elected from each class, and eight at-large Senators are also elected. Furthermore, the four Class Presidents also serve as senators, for a total of 32. Each year, the Senate is given a budget (which is a part of the whole SGA budget), that they are vested with distributing to various campus organizations. Campus organizations and individuals petition the Senate for funds that go to various club activities and for competitions such as Model Arab League. =Campus Activities Board= Barlow Girl performing on the OBU campus Campus Activities Board (CAB) serves the university by sponsoring entertainment activities throughout the year. CAB sponsors three major talent and variety shows each academic year: Biggie, Freshmen Follies and Spring Affair. Biggie is reserved for upperclassmen, Follies for freshmen, and Spring Affair is open to all students. Acts and emcees for each show are selected through auditions. In additions, CAB also sponsors T.W.I.R.P. (The Woman is Required to Pay) Week and Christmas events including Kerr Old Fashioned Christmas, CAB/ARAmark Banquet and Kids' Christmas, and other community activities. =The Herd= The Herd is a student organization that assists in recruiting new students to OBU.

The shell can reach up to about 110 mm √ò, its outer side is smooth and ranges from light greenish creamy colour to medium brown , probably varies to match the background; the interior is white to soft pink. The concentric and radial growth lines are easily seen. Callista chione is edible, different dishes are prepared throughout the Mediterranean in Spain, Italy, France, the Balkan and the Maghreb countries. It has been found that, as is the case with many bivalve molluscs, which are filter-feeders, (they feed by filtering food particles from the water), that Callista chione, common in fish markets in the Mediterranean, concentrates toxins from dinoflagellates blooms associated with pollution events such as red tides , sewage water, old sediment dredging, ship ballast water dumping, etc. These toxins cannot be eliminated by the traditional cleansing of shellfish in clean water or by cooking, and can be responsible for complex human health problems: respiratory ailments, skin rashes, even paralysis, etc., such as it is known now to have occurred in New Orleans, associated with the contact or ingestion of severely contaminated water, left by Hurricane Katrina. The commonest of these dangers is known as PSP or paralytic shellfish poisoning.

Due to the United States boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics, he was the only American to win a medal at those games, using a dual citizenship to play for Italy. Biography Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Sylvester graduated from Moeller High School with All-American honors, and played college basketball at the University of Dayton. At 6'5\\", he was known as an accurate shooter. Sylvester's highlight with the Dayton Flyers happened at the 1974 NCAA championship, scoring 36 points in a game where the Flyers forced three overtimes and nearly upset Bill Walton's UCLA.Born to Play - Matt Sylvester's Roots Planted on the Court Following that, Sylvester reported for both the NBA and ABA Drafts, being chosen only in the sixth round by the Detroit Pistons in the 1974 NBA draft, and the tenth by the Carolina Cougars in the ABA one. Afterwards, Cesare Rubini of Italian team Olimpia Milano invited him to play for the team in the 1974‚Äì75 FIBA Koraƒá Cup. Rubini was ordered by Milano president to seek American basketballers of Italian descent seeking naturalization, and Sylvester qualified as his grandfather was an Italian immigrant. Sylvester (known in Italy as \\"Silvester\\") would then sign with Milano, and right away be a major part of the team that won the 1975‚Äì76 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. Milano's victorious years with Sylvester would end in 1980, as after he had a heated argument with teammate C. J. Kupec, coach Dan Peterson would request for Sylvester to leave the team, and he would be traded to Pesaro for a then-Italian record $500,000. His Italian career also included stints with Basket Rimini and Virtus Bologna.Mike Silvester Italy Always In the Heart of Mike Sylvester Sylvester Michael Joseph Sylvester was naturalized Italian in 1977. Three years later, he would be called for the Italy national basketball team, and had a great performance at the European qualifier that gave the Italians a spot at the Olympic tournament to be held in Moscow. However, as soon as Sylvester heard the United States was leading the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, Sylvester wondered if he needed to adhere, particularly as an Italian player refusing an Olympic invitation could potentially banned from playing professionally. He contacted the U.S. State Department, who advised Sylvester to play. He still abstained from a vote within the Italian team about the boycott, saying he would follow the squad's decision ‚Äì the Italians eventually played, though under the Olympic flag. Despite suffering a sprained ankle during the 1980 Summer Olympics, he won a silver medal after the Italians upset the Soviet Union before losing the Olympic final to Yugoslavia. Sylvester was the only American to win a medal at those games.Moeller grad was only American to medal in '80 Sarantakes, Nicholas Evan (2010). Dropping the Torch: Jimmy Carter, the Olympic Boycott, and the Cold War. New York: Cambridge University Press. . p. 133. In the following years, he would spend six seasons with Scavolini Pesaro, leading them to the 1985 Coppa Italia, two Italian League Runner-Up finishes (1981‚Äì82 & 1984‚Äì85), the 1983 Saporta Cup title, the 1986 Saporta Cup Finals and the 1984 Saporta Cup Semis. Sylvester is a current resident of Loveland, Ohio. The Sylvester family has a sports tradition. Mike's brothers Steve and Vince were American football players, with the former reaching the NFL playing for the Oakland Raiders, and the latter being a college star at the University of Cincinnati.

This article principally considers English law. Other legal jurisdictions' approaches are discussed. Common design also applies in the law of tort. It is a different legal test from that which applies in the criminal law. The difference between common designs in the criminal law and the civil law was illustrated in NCB v Gamble [1959] 1 QB 11 at 23, by Devlin LJ: \\"the consequence [in the criminal law] is that selling a person a gun knowing that person will use it to kill someone else will make the seller an accessory to the murder but will not in itself make him liable in tort.\\" The difference applies in US law as well. The United States Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in Sony Corporation of America v Universal City Studios Inc. 464 US 417 (1984). The supply of equipment for copying video cassettes did not give rise to joint liability in tort for copyright infringement. There was no encouragement to copy music and therefore no liability as an accessory. The difference lies between mere knowledge at the point of sale and action combined with common intention: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v Grokster Ltd. 545 US 913 (2005): see pp 931. A different result was reached in Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer by the US Supreme Court. There was a common design there because the defendants \\"distribute[d] a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright\\". That test was satisfied because clear statements and positive steps were taken by the administrators of the website to encourage infringement. A common application of the rule is to impute criminal liability for wounding a person to participants in a riot who knew, or were reckless as to knowing, that one of their number had a knife and might use it, despite the fact that the other participants did not have knives themselves. In England and Wales and certain other Commonwealth countries, this was the understanding of the courts until February 2016, when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council jointly ruled in R v Jogee that it was wrong, and that nothing less than intent to assist the crime would do.R v Jogee and Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKSC 8 and [2016] UKPC 7 at UKSC website (retrieved 18 February 2016) The common purpose doctrine was established in English law, and later adopted in other common-law jurisdictions including Scotland, Ireland, Australia,See McAuliffe v R [1995] HCA 37; 183CLR 108 and Miller v The Queen [2016] HCA 30 Trinidad and Tobago, the Solomon Islands, Texas, Massachusetts, the International Criminal Court, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Jurisdictions =English law= An old example of this doctrine in English law is R v Swindall and Osborne (1846) 2 Car. & K. 230. Two cart drivers engaged in a race. One of them ran down and killed a pedestrian. It was not known which one had driven the fatal cart, but since they were encouraging each other in the race, it was irrelevant which of them had actually struck the man and both were held jointly liable. Thus the parties must share a common purpose and make it clear to each other by their actions that they are acting on their common intention, so that each member of the group assumes responsibility for the actions of the whole group. When this happens, all that flows from the execution of the plan makes them all liable. This is a question of causation, in that oblique intention will be imputed for intermediate consequences that are a necessary precondition to achieving the ultimate purpose, and liability will follow where there are accidental and unforeseen departures from the plan, so long as there is no novus actus interveniens to break the chain. Until 2016, in cases where there is violence beyond the level anticipated, the prosecution had to prove: In R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8 the UK Supreme Court decided that (c) was wrong, and that the prosecution actually had to prove that D had intended that A would commit the offence. Deliberate departure Where one of the participants deliberately departs from the common purpose by doing something that was not authorised or agreed upon, that participant alone is liable for the consequences. In the situation exemplified in Davies v DPP [1954] AC 378, a group comes together for a fight or to commit a crime, and either the participant knows or does not know that one of the group has a weapon. If the person knows that there is a weapon, it is foreseeable that it might be used and the fact that the other participants do not instruct the one carrying to leave it behind means that its use must be within the scope of their intention. However, if the person does not know of the weapon, this is a deliberate departure from the common purpose and this breaks the enterprise. When the outcome is death The simplest form of joint enterprise to murder is two or more planning to cause death and doing so. If all the parties participated in carrying out the plan, all are liable, regardless of who actually inflicted the fatal injury. However, when there is no plan to murder and one party kills while carrying out a plan to do something else, such as a planned robbery in which the participants hope to be able to get what they want without killing anyone, but one of them in fact kills, the other participants may still be guilty of murder or manslaughter if they had the necessary mens rea. In R v Craig & Bentley (1953), Derek Bentley was hanged for the murder of a police officer, committed in the course of a burglary attempt. The murder was committed by a friend and accomplice of Bentley's, Christopher Craig, then aged 16. Bentley was convicted as a party to the murder, by English law principle of common criminal purpose \\"joint enterprise\\". The judge in court (Lord Chief Justice Goddard) sentenced Bentley to death based on an interpretation of the phrase \\"Let him have it\\" (Bentley's alleged instruction to Craig), describing Bentley as \\"mentally aiding the murder of Police Constable Sidney Miles\\". In 1998, Bentley received a posthumous pardon. In R v Lovesey and Peterson (1969) 530 million. App. R. 461, a gang was executing a plan to overpower a jeweller and steal his more valuable stock. After the robbery, the jeweller was found dead. All were properly convicted of murder because the death was the outcome of the agreed use of violence. That this accidentally caused the jeweller's death did not prevent liability. The usual case will involve plans to commit criminal damage, burglary, rape or some other crime, and there will be no compelling inference that there must also have been a plan to kill. For the participants to be convicted of murder, the question becomes one of foresight that one of them might kill. In R v Powell (Anthony) and English [1999] 1 AC 1, the House of Lords said that the other participants must have realised that, in the course of the joint enterprise, the primary party might kill with intent to do so or with intent to cause grievous bodily harm: with the intent necessary for murder. Thus, the Powell and English doctrine extends joint enterprise liability from the paradigm case of a plan to murder to the case of a plan to commit another offence in the course of which the possibility of a murder is foreseen (see R v Bryce. 2004). In Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 2004) (2005) EWCA Crim 1882, the defendant, H, was charged with manslaughter. H had sent K and C to terrify R, knowing both that K and C would have a loaded firearm with them, and that this firearm might be fired near R to increase his fear. The Court of Appeal held that H's liability depended on the scope of the joint enterprise. On the assumed facts, there was no evidence that H foresaw that the gun would be fired and R might be injured. Rather, K's intentional act of firing the gun so as to kill or cause R grievous bodily harm was fundamentally different from the acts contemplated by H. The outcome would have been different if there had been a common design to cause some harm to R. In such a case, H would be liable for manslaughter because, albeit to frighten, he had authorised the firing of the gun: he would have realised that K might intentionally cause some harm when he fired the gun. However, on the assumed facts, H did not foresee the possibility of any harm to R, let alone intentional harm, so he was properly acquitted. In R v Gnango [2011] UKSC 59, the Supreme Court held that D2 is guilty of the offence of murdering V if (1) D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if (2) D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight. Baker argues that the case was wrongly decided because it did not rest on oblique intention, invoked joint-perpetration where there was none, invoked the \\"provocative act murder doctrine where it did not apply, and overly restricted the incidental party/victim rule without seeing that it did not apply because the actual victim as opposed to the putative victim (Gnango) did not consent to being harmed.\\" In R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8, the Supreme Court decided that intent, not mere foresight, must be proved to convict an accomplice of a crime of specific intent, such as murder. The court said \\"foresight of what might happen is ordinarily no more than evidence from which a jury can infer the presence of a requisite intention. It may be strong evidence, but its adoption as a test for the mental element for murder in the case of a secondary party is a serious and anomalous departure from the basic rule, which results in over-extension of the law of murder.\\"Paragraph 83 He summarised the law as: \\"If the crime requires a particular intent, D2 must intend ... to assist D1 to act with such intent.\\"Paragraph 90 (This appeal was heard jointly with an appeal from Jamaica to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, with the same judges, Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKPC 7.) Repentance One person who has been an active member of a group with a common purpose may escape liability by withdrawing before the others go on to commit the crime. Mere repentance without any action, however, leaves the party liable. To be effective, the withdrawing party must actively seek to prevent the others from relying on what has been done. In R v Becerra (1975) 62 Crim. App. R. 212 it was held that any communication of withdrawal by the secondary party to the perpetrator must be such as to serve \\"unequivocal notice\\" upon the other party to the common purpose that, if he proceeds upon it, he does so without the further aid and assistance of the withdrawing party.: * If an accomplice only advised or encouraged the principal to commit the crime, he must at least communicate his withdrawal to the other parties. * Where an accomplice has supplied the principal with the means of committing the crime, the accomplice must arguably neutralise, or at least take all reasonable steps to neutralise, the aid he has given. * In more serious cases, it may be that the only effective withdrawal is either physical intervention or calling in the police. In R v Rook (1997) Cr. App. R. 327, the court held that, as in the case of joint enterprise where both parties are present at the scene of the crime, it is not necessary for the prosecution to show that a secondary party who lends assistance or encouragement before the commission of the crime intended the victim to be killed, or to suffer serious injury, provided it was proved that he foresaw the event as a real or substantial risk and nonetheless lent his assistance. Rook was convicted as one of a gang of three men who met and agreed the details of a contract killing of the wife of a fourth man on the next day. Rook did not turn up the next day and the killing was done by his two fellows. His defence was that he never intended the victim to be killed and believed that, if he failed to appear, the others would not go through with the plan. Lloyd LJ. described the evidence against him in this way: This did not amount to an unequivocal communication of his withdrawal from the scheme contemplated at the time he gave his assistance. Controversy The use of this doctrine has caused concern among academics and practitioners in the legal community and has been the subject of an investigation by the House of Commons Justice Select Committee in the UK. In 2010, a campaign group was formed in the UK called JENGbA (Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association), which seeks reform of the law and supports those convicted by this means. JENGbA asserts that the misapplication of the principle constitutes a form of human rights abuse. On 6 July 2014, Common, a 90-minute television drama written by Jimmy McGovern, was shown on BBC One. It examined the issues surrounding a case of joint enterprise or common unlawful purpose murder. On 7 July 2014, a documentary regarding a number of joint enterprise cases, Guilty by Association, was also shown on BBC One. One of these cases is that of Alex Henry, convicted in March 2014 at the Old Bailey alongside Janhelle Grant-Murray and Cameron Ferguson, for the murder of Taqui Khezihi and the non-fatal stabbing of Bourhane Khezihi. The court heard how Alex Henry was shopping in Ealing Broadway on a Tuesday afternoon in August 2013 with his two co-defendants. He exited the shopping centre with Ferguson to see Grant-Murray being confronted by a group of four older men who were unknown to all defendants. CCTV showed that Grant-Murray was holding a wine bottle by the neck and Bourhane Khezihi had removed his belt to use as a knuckle duster. A combination of CCTV evidence and mobile phone video footage was used to piece together the 47-second affray in which Alex Henry can be seen running into the affray and running back to the shopping centre. At trial Cameron Ferguson pleaded guilty to murder and grievous bodily harm. Alex Henry and Janhelle Grant-Murray were both found guilty by a majority verdict of 11‚Äì1. It was their presence at the scene of the spontaneous 47-second affray which was held to amount to encouragement of the stabbing. They both received a life sentence with a minimum prison term of 19 years. On 25 February 2015, an appeal to the Court of Appeal by two convicted murderers was successful. A young man, Jonathan Fitchett, had been killed at a retail park after an altercation with Childs, who was joined by his friend Price. Although both defendants had punched the victim, an expert medical witness said that just a single punch was fatal, and it was unknown who threw the fatal punch. The Liverpool Crown Court had convicted both of murder using the device of common purpose. The Appeal Court found that there had been no intent to cause really serious injury, and that there was no evidence of \\"common purpose\\". The first defendant's conviction was reduced to manslaughter, and the second was reduced to affray. The Court said that for common purpose/joint enterprise to arise, there must be satisfactory evidence of a joint plan. (The absence of precise actus reus was glossed over.)

It was a landing place of the d‚ÄôEntrecasteaux expedition to find missing explorer La P√©rouse. It is named in honour of the Recherche, one of the expedition's ships. The Nuenonne name for the bay is Leillateah. French exploration The explorers set up a camp, made a garden and scientific observatory at Recherche Bay in April 1792 for 26 days, and again in January 1793 for 24 days. Both landings were made to seek refuge and replenish supplies although as much time as possible was dedicated to scientific research. The botanists Jacques Labillardi√®re, Claude Riche and √âtienne Pierre Ventenat, assisted by gardener botanist F√©lix Delahaye, collected and catalogued almost 5000 specimens including the blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), which later became Tasmania's floral emblem. The expedition also made friendly contact with the Tasmanian Aboriginal people there in 1793. The scientific observatory at Recherche Bay was the site of the first deliberate scientific experiment on Australian soil. At this observatory, geoscientist Elisabeth Paul Edouard de Rossel conducted a series of measurements that proved geomagnetism varied with latitude. British settlement Being isolated from the main areas of early settlement, exposed to easterly gales, and the terrain and soils of a nature that discouraged European agriculture, Recherche Bay saw only moderate activity following the British settlement of Van Diemen's Land. In 1829, Recherche Bay was the site of the Cyprus mutiny, in which the brig Cyprus was seized by convicts being transported from Hobart Town to Macquarie Harbour Penal Station. The mutineers marooned officers, soldiers, and convicts who did not join the mutiny, without supplies. The mutineers then sailed the Cyprus to Canton, China, where they scuttled her and claimed to be castaways from another vessel. On the way, Cyprus visited Japan during the height of the period of severe Japanese restrictions on the entry of foreigners, the first Australian ship to do so. During the 1830s and 1840s, the bay was the site of up to five bay whaling stations.Michael Nash, The bay whalers; Tasmania's shore-based whaling industry, Navarine, Canberra, 2003, p.134-6. it was also a base for pilots guiding ships up the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Whaling ships often sheltered there from wild weather, or to try-out whales. Two whalers, the Maria Orr, in 1846, and Offley, in 1880, were wrecked there in gales. The main commercial activities in the later 19th century and into the early 20th century were timber-gathering, mostly centred on the township of Leprena and coal mining, the latter mostly based around the township of Catamaran. The Catamaran Coal Company employed the former barque James Craig as a coal hulk there. Controversy since 2003 In 2003 the private landowners of the D'Entrecasteaux expedition site sought permission to selectively log the area, which was opposed by a large-scale campaign to protect the site from destruction. In January 2006 the Tasmanian Land Conservancy (TLC) announced plans to raise a minimum of A$1.3 million to purchase the site from its private owners. Dick Smith pledged A$100,000 to the cause, and two weeks later it was announced that over $2 million had been raised to purchase and rehabilitate the site, and that it would be owned by the TLC. Part of the bay, being the north east peninsula area comprising , was included in the National Heritage List on 7 October 2005.

He is also the current member of the Sai Kung District Council for Wan Hang. Former leader of the reformist faction in the Democratic Party, he led the reformists splitting from the party to form the Neo Democrats over the controversial 2010 constitutional reform proposal, taking a moderate localist stance. After the disqualification of Ventus Lau, a 2018 by-election candidate, was ruled unlawful by the Court of Final Appeal, the by-election was seen as invalid and Fan was unseated in December 2019 as a result. Party politics Of Huiyang Hakka ancestry, Gary Fan is a graduate of San Francisco State University. Fan joined the Democratic Party after returning to Hong Kong. Fan was a leading member of the Democratic Party, including being a member of the standing committee of its central committee.Democrats lick wounds as 30 reform radicals quit , The Standard, Colleen Lee, 20 December 2010Neo Democrats set out their store, RTHK, 23 January 2011, Accessed 23 January 2011 Fan opposed the Democratic party's stance on the Five Constituencies Referendum movement and its support of the constitutional reform package in 2010. He, Chan King-ming and other reformists quit the Democratic Party in December 2010. Before that they had already formed the Neo Democrats political grouping on 2 October 2010. He held the position of one of its four convenors from 2010 to 2012. In the 2012 LegCo elections, Fan won a new seat in the New Territoires East geographical constituency created under the 2010 constitutional reform package. Legislative councillor Gary Fan has taken an anti-immigration stance in the Legislative Council, differing from other pan-democrats who tended to support new arrivals. Fan called for the government to take back the approval rights on One-way Permits from Chinese authorities and to reduce the quota of such permits. Fan also refers to immigrants from mainland China and the quota of 150 daily permits as \\"the root of the housing problem\\". In January 2013, Gary Fan and Claudia Mo formed a group called \\"HK First\\". They co-sponsored a controversial ad which claimed that reducing immigration would help the people of Hong Kong to get to the bottom of the housing problem, while rejecting claims of bias or discrimination against mainlanders, despite condemnation from the Equal Opportunities Commission. Fan later introduced a motion on adhering to the need to \\"put Hong Kong people first\\" in formulating policies, but the motion was ultimately defeated. He lost his seat in New Territories East in the 2016 Legislative Council election, due to the unexpectedly that Andrew Cheng returned which had claimed to split his votes. As a result, he resigned his party position as an executive committee member. He returned to the Legislative Council in the 2018 New Territories by-election following the disqualification of localist Baggio Leung of Youngspiration over the Legislative Council oath-taking controversy in March. He was elected with more than 180,000 votes, defeating the pro-Beijing common candidate Tang Ka- piu of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB). After the disqualification of Ventus Lau, a 2018 by-election candidate, was ruled unlawful by the Court of Final Appeal, the by-election was seen as invalid and Fan was unseated in December 2019 alongside Au Nok-hin as a result, after the Court of Final Appeal rejected both appeal applications.

It is a mono-ed (boys') school offering education from third grade to eleventh grade, averaging 8‚Äì18 years of age. The school is a single shift school with over 2500 students. Established in 1954 as the \\"St. Joseph English Medium School\\" in 16 Monir Hossain Lane, Narinda in the current old part of Dhaka by the Congregation of Holy Cross missionaries, the institution had a General Certificate of Education (GCE) based education structure. The current campus is at 97, Asad Avenue, Mohammedpur, Dhaka. History On 19 March 1954, Brother Jude opened the door of 16 Monir Hossain Lane for four students to start St. Joseph High School. The classes were taught in the parlour for the first year. The following year, a single storied building was constructed by Brother Andrew at 32, Shah Shaheb Lane, Narinda. In 1960, a second roof was added as the enrolment of the school rose to 269. In 1963, nine years after opening, the school was sufficiently developed to enable to two major accomplishments to take place‚Äîboth of which was to bring Brother Jude's original idea closer to realization. In October 1964, to accommodate the increasing enrollment, Brother Fulgence, Superior of the Brothers, began work on a new school complex in Mohammadpur. In November of that same year, the first class of boys from St. Joseph sat for the Cambridge Examinations. This group was the first group of many groups to bring honor to the school. In July, 1965, all the classes shifted from Narinda to the Mohammadpur compound. The new school was very modern and quite unfinished. The first classes held here were for adventuresome boys who had to climb over construction materials, bear up with construction noises and brave the elements. But the joy of having new school brought out a new spirit which grew as the school developed. In 1974, the first batch of boys took the SSC Examination and 32 of the 33 boys passed and one of them was placed ninth in the combined merit list. After the liberation and independence of Bangladesh, the school started to grow and develop with the new country. The medium of instruction changed to Bangla and the school registered with Dhaka board. In 1973 the last of the Cambridge groups took their examinations. During the ten years of Cambridge, 233 boys took the overseas examination and 98% passed with over 60% in the first division. Each year brings forth some achievement for the school but for over 59 years, St. Joseph has continued the traditions set by the first pioneers and Brother Jude, Advancing in Wisdom and virtue. St Joseph celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2004 at the school campus. On 19 March 2014, St. Joseph celebrated its 60th anniversary of establishment.

Our motto is \\"Let infinity be your limit\\". =Publications= The Josephite is the yearbook of St. Joseph published annually to record the activities of the institution all the year round.

The Josephite is thought to have been first published in 1967 and since then it has been published every year to display the activities and performance of the students. =Sports and games= Sports and games are indispensable part of life as they contribute a lot towards the solid growth of a physical and mental health. They remove the tedium and fatigue emanated from the monotonous scheduled class life. They also help the formation of character by teaching the virtue of discipline and punctuality. They pave the way for developing some other human qualities such as quick decision-making, firmness of mind, teamwork, cooperative spirit, preferring collective interest to personal one, which are extremely necessary in every walk of life. Football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, table tennis (ping-pong), badminton, chess are the most common sports and games held almost regularly on the ground. St. Joseph teams routinely take part in national and international sporting events and thus producing great players like Shahriar Nafees (cricketer), Grand Master Niaz Morshed, Grand Master Ziaur Rahman and Grand Master Reefat Bin Sattar. The most important of all the events held on the campus is the Annual Sports. On the annual sports day, a number of traditional track and field events are organised for both the students and teachers. These include long jump, high jump, triple jump, shot put, discus throwing, relay race, 100-metre sprint, 200-metre sprint, 400-metre sprint, 800-metre sprint, 1500-metre sprint, dress as you like, tug-of war and what not. A lot of prizes are given away to the winners in different events. =Excursions= St. Joseph always looks to ways of improving students physically, mentally and socially. With this view in mind, St. Joseph allows and encourages students to go on picnics, study tours or excursions either on campus or out of campus or even outside the country. Each class (classes-III to X) arranges picnic or study tour either on campus or out of campus. This gives students an opportunity to get close to their teachers and discover them more outside the class. A four-day-long study tour to Chittagong-Cox's Bazar- St. Martin for the students of class-XI is the most exciting and enjoyable event. From this tour students can gain a good deal of practical knowledge, life-time experience and unforgettable pleasure. They have opportunities to learn a lot besides merely sight-seeing, wallowing in the seawater or enjoying different foods. =Certificate awarding ceremony= St. Joseph recognizes the real talents and therefore arranges an annual function to award the students who stand out with their outstanding performance in JSC,PEC,SSC and HSC. A certificate and a crest as a memorabilia is given out to each student to mark the institutional recognition.

Lewis and based on the novel The Woman in Red by Anthony Gilbert. This drama is the first in a series of films noir directed by Lewis and features Nina Foch, Dame May Whitty and George Macready.. Plot In London, Julia Ross (Nina Foch) goes to a new employment agency, desperate for work. When Mrs. Sparkes (Anita Sharp-Bolster) learns that she has no near relations, she recommends Julia for a job as a live-in personal secretary to a wealthy widow, Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Whitty). Mrs. Hughes approves and insists that she move that very night into her house. Two days later, Julia awakes as a prisoner at an isolated seaside estate in Cornwall. All her possessions have disappeared and the young woman is told she is really Marion, the wife of Ralph Hughes (George Macready), Mrs. Hughes's son. The staff have been told that she has suffered a nervous breakdown; as a result, they ignore her seemingly wild claims, and her attempts to escape are all foiled. Julia writes a letter to Dennis Bruce (Roland Varno), her only close friend and admirer, and cleverly leaves it where it can be found. The Hugheses substitute a blank sheet of paper and allow her to post it, unaware that Julia has anticipated them and written a second letter. That night, Julia discovers a secret passage to her room and overhears Ralph admit to his mother that he murdered his wife in a fit of rage and disposed of her body in the sea. Even so, when a \\"doctor\\" comes in response to a fake poisoning attempt, she blurts out her plan to him, only to discover that he (along with Mrs. Sparkes) is in on the scheme. He is dispatched to London to intercept the letter. When the real doctor shows up, Julia thinks he's also a fake and refuses to see him. The doctor recommends she be taken to a hospital immediately, but Mrs. Hughes persuades him to come back in the morning. Julia's captors have to make it appear that she has committed suicide before the doctor can take her away. Julia throws her gown out the window, making it look like she threw herself to her death, then hides in the secret passage. When the doctor drives up, Mrs. Hughes delays him so that her son can get to the body first. Ralph picks up a rock to ensure that Julia is really dead, but is stopped by Dennis and a policeman, who had been alerted by the letter. (The fake doctor had been apprehended in London when he tried to intercept the letter.) When Ralph tries to flee, he is shot down. Later, Julia and Dennis drive away and talk about getting married.

It is quite evident that they strived earnestly to whip up excitement and suspense, but somehow that electrifying quality which distinguishes good melodrama is lacking in this transcription of the Anthony Gilbert novel, The Woman in Red ... While Joseph Lewis, the director, succeeds in creating an effectively ominous atmosphere, he has not been as adept in handling the players, and that, we suspect, is why My Name Is Julia Ross misses the mark.Crowther, Bosly. The New York Times, film review, November 9, 1945. Accessed: July 25, 2013. The staff at Variety magazine praised the production, writing \\"Mystery melodrama with a psychological twist runs only 64 minutes but it's fast and packed with tense action throughout. Acting and production (though apparently modestly budgeted) are excellent.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1945. Accessed: July 25, 2013.

The two fathers began preaching under a divergent doctrine after Michael Crotty was forced from the church where he had been a temporary curate. Michael was able to convince some parishioners who had followed him to construct a new church, which is now used as a store. The schism created was mostly exhausted by 1842.

On February 6, 1997 he became Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.

The unicameral legislature consists of 43 seats, all of which are determined by single mandate constituencies. It is headed by a chairman (or speaker).  History  The Republic of Moldova still considers Transnistria to be part of its territory, although the Second Congress of People's Deputies declared separation from the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova on 2 September 1990 as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. As Transnistria was not an autonomous region before the declaration of its independence, it had no government bodies of its own in the USSR. This meant that all government authorities had to be formed from scratch. On 2 September 1990, the Second Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies of all levels of Transnistria elected the Provisional Supreme Council of Transnistria, which was tasked to prepare elections to the permanent Supreme Council. Igor Smirnov was elected chairman of the Provisional Supreme Council in March 1990. After Smirnov was elected Chairman of the Republic (later this post was transformed into the presidential office) on 29 November 1990 he was succeeded by Vladimir Gonchar.History of creation and development of the Parliament of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic On 25 November 1990, the first legislative elections to the Supreme Council of PMR took place in Transnistria.

The Council of the Republic was replaced by the Chamber of Legislators and the Council of Nationalities by the Chamber of Representatives. The second Supreme Council was elected for a five-year term and consisted of 67 deputies (32 in the lower house and 35 in the upper house). Elections to the second Supreme Council took place on 24 December 1995.The Supreme Council of PMR, 1990‚Äì2010 In 2000 amendments were made in the Constitution of PMR leading to new change in the organization of the Supreme Council.

Her full title was Mar√≠a de los Desamparados Mu√±oz y de Borb√≥n, condesa de Vista Alegre. Her mother, Queen mother Mar√≠a Christina, had been the fourth queen consort of Ferdinand VII of Spain, a maternal uncle with whom she had had two daughters; the elder, Infanta Mar√≠a Isabel Luisa, was proclaimed Queen Isabella II of Spain at the age of three upon her father's death on 29 September 1833, with Queen Mother Mar√≠a Christina as regent. Mar√≠a Christina married Agust√≠n Fernando Mu√±oz, a sergeant from the royal guard, on 28 December 1833, and Mar√≠a Amparo was their first child, born in Madrid in 1834. The conservative supporters of the late king's brother, Carlos de Borb√≥n, believed that Carlos should have been next in line to the throne. The infant Queen Isabella held on to the throne through the period of the First Carlist War, in which General Baldomero Espartero led the forces of Queen Isabella to victory. Soon after the war's end, in 1840, Espartero took over as regent, with Mar√≠a Amparo leaving with her parents to live in exile in France. There, Mar√≠a Amparo and her siblings grew up in the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison. In 1844, when Mar√≠a Amparo's half-sister Queen Isabella was declared to be of age, Isabella gave their father (stepfather), Mu√±oz, the title Duque de Ri√°nsares. On 1 March 1855, Mar√≠a Amparo was married at Malmaison to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski, a Polish prince living in exile in France. They lived at the H√¥tel Lambert, the Czartoryski family's base of operations during the Second French Empire. She and Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw had a son, August Czartoryski, born on 2 August 1858. August became a priest in 1892, and acted in ways that have led to his consideration for sainthood, receiving beatification in 2004. Death Mar√≠a Amparo contracted tuberculosis, which she passed to her son when he was six. She died shortly thereafter on 19 August 1864, aged 29, in Paris. Her remains were buried in the tomb of three of her brothers in the cemetery at Rueil-Malmaison. A year later her husband moved them to his family mausoleum in Sieniawa.

Here they built a log school, a log church and established a cemetery. Many of these early settlers later moved to Collingwood, Oro, or Owen Sound.

The discovery and refurbishment of this cemetery is documented in the 2000 National Film Board of Canada film, Speakers for the Dead, co-directed by Jennifer Holness and David Sutherland (now Sudz Sutherland). Gaelic-speaking Scottish people arrived around 1850. Almost all the early headstones in the pioneer cemetery commemorate people of Scottish origin. Some of these settlers intermarried with the black settlers. Amenities in Priceville include a post office; a riverside park with a picnic area, swimming and fishing opportunities, and a canoe and kayak launch; a toboggan hill; a sports park; an outdoor skating rink; and a children's playground. Events that attract many visitors include a biennial Santa Claus parade, an annual antique car and tractor show, and a July 1 Canada Day celebration with a concert and fireworks.

He was also the great-uncle of actors Matt Dillon and Kevin Dillon. Biography Born in Riverside, Connecticut and raised in New Rochelle, New York, Raymond's first cartoons were published in his high school newspaper. In 1935, he started as an assistant on the Blondie comic strip, mostly as a replacement for his brother, who had been working on Blondie for three years before leaving to start his own strips. Initially, Raymond's responsibilities were quite minor, but by 1937, when the first son of Blondie creator Chic Young died of jaundice, Raymond was considered experienced enough to take over both writing and drawing the strip for a year. In 1938, Chic Young returned from his sabbatical, resuming his place as the main writer of Blondie. Raymond continued to play a major role in creating the artwork, in addition to a short stint assisting his brother Alex on Jungle Jim around 1944. In 1950, due to Chic's diminishing eyesight, Raymond permanently became the lead artist of Blondie and began to develop the distinctive style that the strip uses to this day. Chic Young died in 1973 and his son Dean, who had been assisting with the writing for about ten years, took over as head writer. Raymond continued as the artist and began sharing a byline credit with Dean soon after. Raymond's health began to fail in 1979, and he died in late 1981 from cancer. After his death, he was succeeded by Mike Gersher, who had assisted him for about 17 years. All Blondie artists since that time have stuck closely to the style that Jim Raymond refined, with small modifications to keep props and clothing styles contemporary.

Formerly an independent village, Arthur was amalgamated into Wellington North on January 1, 1999. History The village was named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Settlers began arriving in 1840. The area was first surveyed in 1841 by John McDonald and then officially in 1846 by D.B. Papineau. During the first survey in 1841, the population of Arthur was 22 people. Over the next 15 years this number rose to 400 and by 1900 the population had risen to just over 1500. The saw and grist mills on the Conestogo River encouraged people to settle here. In 1851, a post office, church and school were organized. Development increased in 1872 when the train line of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway reached the village which was incorporated in that year. The Arthur Enterprise News, established in 1863, was one of the few non-syndicated weekly newspapers in Canada. By 1890, a high school had been opened. In 1897, Arthur was one of the first villages in Ontario to be connected to an electricity line; power was only available in the evenings. =Canada's most patriotic village= Arthur Cenotaph In November 1942, the Toronto Star ran a front-page headline that read \\"Arthur Village Gives Sons and Money to Aid the War\\", and recognized Arthur as the Most Patriotic Village in Canada, as one out of every seven Arthur residents fought in the Second World War. At that time 126 residents had enlisted from the population of 890. It was the highest ratio in comparison to villages of comparable sizes in Canada. By the end of the war, 338 Arthur residents had enlisted, and 25 were killed in action. During the first war bond campaign of World War II, the village of Arthur was the first community in Ontario to reach its quota, which it did within a few minutes. Arthur also led the communities in Wellington for every other war and victory bond campaign and surpassed all objectives that had been set. By the end of the fourth campaign, Arthur had raised a total of $250,000 which was an amount equal to 64% of the assessed value of the village's taxable property. In 2002, David Tilson, MPP for Dufferin‚ÄîPeel‚ÄîWellington‚ÄîGrey stated in the Ontario legislature, that because of the village of Arthur's extraordinary World War II record, the community was now being recognized as \\"Canada's Most Patriotic Village\\". The sacrifice of these soldiers is honoured by the Cenotaph of Arthur, located in the heart of the village. The monument was unveiled on August 6, 1923 by Mrs. David Brocklebank, whose son was killed at the end of World War I, before the largest crowd ever assembled in Arthur village. After the unveiling the Toronto Star described the cenotaph as \\"a war memorial whose design and beauty cannot be equaled as yet in the Province.\\" On the cenotaph are engraved the names of the 193 men who enlisted in World War I (including the 40 who were KIA), as well as the 363 men and women who enlisted in World War II, among whom 25 made the ultimate sacrifice. One unique feature of the cenotaph was that when it was being designed a decision was made to build the monument with stones gathered from local farms. It was later discovered that the memorial was the first fieldstone Cenotaph Memorial built in the province. Some of the men that enlisted from the Arthur area were British Home Children that were sent here from orphanages in the UK. Between 1869 and 1948 over 118,000 orphaned and abandoned children up to the age of 16 were sent to Canada to work as farm hands and domestic servants. Demographics The population of Arthur at the 2011 Statistics Canada Census was 2,427. Attractions =Murals of Arthur= File:Pioneer Mural Painted by Allen C.

There are two buses in each direction on Monday to Saturday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Education =Arthur High School= Built in 1890 and located on Smith Street, the first Arthur High School was constructed by D.M. McPherson. At the time it opened there were 53 students and 2 teachers but after an addition was built in 1906 it had doubled in size. Joining the teaching staff in 1927 and becoming principal three years later, P.E. Brown stayed on as principal until his retirement in 1967. In 1953, a larger high school was built along Conestoga Street which was able to hold many more students until it closed in 2004. The building has now been converted into the new home for Arthur Public School. Students from the Arthur community now attend high school at the Wellington Heights Secondary School in the neighboring town of Mount Forest. =Arthur Public School= Constructed in 1945 on the same grounds as the previous public school, the building on Eliza Street stayed open until 2005 when the school was then relocated to the old high school building on Conestoga Street. =St. John's Catholic School= Originally built in 1884; St. John's School was located on Georgina Street beside the St. John's Church. This school was demolished and replaced with a one-storey school in 1963. A new school was built on the east end of Tucker Street in 1995 where Catholic students from the Arthur area still attend. The former school on Georgina Street is now being used as a Parish Centre for St. John's Church.

In the game, Mario, his friends, and his enemies play golf on a variety of Mario-themed courses. Following NES Open Tournament Golf, it is the second game in the Mario Golf series. A Game Boy Color version of the game was also developed by Camelot Software Planning. Unlike the console version, it includes role-playing video game elements. Gameplay Mario Golf is the first game in the series to use 3D computer graphics. Players choose from a variety of characters including Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, and Wario. The game also introduces Plum, Sonny, Harry, Maple, and Charlie, new characters created by Camelot specifically for the game, who have not appeared since (except for Plum's appearance as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee and as a sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl). Players can then select from a number of courses which have features adapted to the Nintendo world. Mario Golf is very easy to play (also known as a \\"pick up and play\\" game) as it makes golf very simple, because it does away with many of the complicated real-life aspects of the sport. Although the game is easy to play and simple in appearance, the game's engine is very deep and there are a multitude of variables that can affect a shot, such as wind strength and direction (indicated by a Boo), rain, characters' individual attributes, spin on the ball, and relief of the land. There is a variety of gameplay modes, including speed golf, ring shot, mini golf and skins match. Every character in the game has recorded voice samples which can be used to comment on opponents' shots. =Transfer Pak= This game features Transfer Pak compatibility with the Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf. Players are able to upload characters and data found on the Game Boy version to the Nintendo 64 version. These characters are then playable in full 3D. Additionally, data from the Nintendo 64 version is saved onto the Game Boy Color version of the game. After playing a round with a GBC character, that character will earn experience points. Transfer Pak functionality is not included in the Virtual Console version. Reception The Nintendo 64 version received \\"universal acclaim\\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave both console versions of the game a score of 30/40. Sequel A sequel to this game, Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, was released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003.

As per the rules of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the United States of America, residents are allowed to work a max of 80 hours a week. Residents work 40‚Äì80 hours a week depending on specialty and rotation within the specialty, with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week. Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork. Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record. Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4,510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call. In a survey of 3,604 first- and second- year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.  Causes of high workloads  Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse. Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to, meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts, thus decreasing the demand for residents, despite the work for many more residents being available. In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors. There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive. The medical culture has also been blamed. \\"Generation-bashing\\", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork. A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important. A higher \\"entry barrier\\", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired. There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods. The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted. Effects on health =Effects of sleep deprivation on residents= The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust. Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991)Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), \\"Shiftwork and Health,\\" special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008). It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning. Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents. There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3. =Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients= The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors and affects attention and working memory. Chronically sleep-deprived people also tend to strongly underestimate their degree of impairment. A study found that after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, hand-eye coordination decreased to a level equal to the performance observed at a blood alcohol concentration of roughly 0.10%. In a meta-analysis of 959 physicians, staying awake for a continuous 24 to 30 hours decreased physicians' overall performance by nearly 1 standard deviation and clinical performance by more than 1.5 standard deviations. Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. \\"Night float\\" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift. First year medical residents given an EKG arrhythmia-detection task performed significantly worse while sleep-deprived than when well-rested. Medical residents were also found to take more time and make more errors on laparoscopic procedures after one night on call. A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors blinded to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study. In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.  Duty hour restrictions  =Effects of duty hour restrictions= Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not because the restrictions are not always followed. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed. Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs. =Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US= The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the ACGME allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff. One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases. Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality. =2003 reform= One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses. Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals. =2011 reform= When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result. Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors. There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See Problems with duty hour restrictions. = Problems with duty hour restrictions = It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09 Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours or even punished if they do not. Moreover, these studies ‚Äì particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices. Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors. Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education. One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision- making and medical errors.  Proposed methods of reducing workloads  The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed. Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the AAMC and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal antitrust laws. Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors. Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment and decrease burnout leading to fewer doctors leaving medicine. =Regulations= EU regulation Junior doctors in the European Union fall under the European Working Time Directive, which specifies: * 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks. * 11 hours continuous rest per day * one day off each week, or two days off each fortnight * 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours. Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled. American regulation The issue is politically controversial in the United States, where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's medical residency. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,Regulation changes regulations from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours of direct patient care with an additional 4 hours for transition of care (sign out, completing notes, etc.) for first, second, and third year residents. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety. While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1). The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours. The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance. The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off. Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs. In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts. When looking at primary outcomes of 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications, less- restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications. Starting July 1, 2017, the ACGME raised the maximum number of consecutive hours a first year resident can work from 16 hours to 24 hours. Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all. In the survey of 4510 obstetric- gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours. These residents cited \\"additional experience\\" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by \\"opportunity to see rare cases\\" (46.5%) and \\"continuity with patients\\" (31.8%). =Towards an 80-hour work week= The Libby Zion case, in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours. Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times. Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage. Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the American Medical Association, has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring \\"We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there.\\" The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs. On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011. The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require: # An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities; # A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call; # A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education; # No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty; # One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and # In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks. Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.\\"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs.\\" 2006. Page 45 of 154. #The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call. #The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours. #The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period. #Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided. #All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity. #Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts. #The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved. #The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period. Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection. There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy. Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce. Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.). Additionally, a one-size- fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties. Coping mechanisms Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes. Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions. Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.

Comic strips Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Lebrun entered the comic strip field in 1975 with Rolling with Roger in the Tampa Neighbor newspaper. In 1976, Lebrun had a daily strip, Aw Heck, in the Tampa Times until 1979. Aw Heck then appeared in the Clearwater Sun from 1979 until 1980. Blondie Lebrun originally assisted on the King Features Syndicate comic strip Blondie as early as 1977, furnishing the strip's owner Dean Young with gag scripts.Moriaty, William. \\"Interview with Denis Lebrun\\" (Part one). La Floridiana. September 12, 2002. In 1982, Lebrun became Blondie's assistant illustrator to head artist Mike Gersher. In this capacity, Lebrun inked the lettering, backgrounds and incidental and secondary characters of the strip. Gersher left the strip in 1984 and was replaced that same year with veteran comic strip illustrator Stan Drake. Drake was the head artist of the strip until his death in 1997. Cartoonist Jeff Parker assisted with the production of the daily strip from 1996 until Lebrun's departure.Moriaty, William. \\"Interview with Denis Lebrun\\" (Part two). La Floridiana. September 2002. In May 1997, Lebrun took over full artistic responsibilities of the strip and was the lead artist until 2005. His final illustrations appeared in the Sunday, July 31, 2005 edition of the strip. The last Lebrun signature was on the September 3, 2005 striphttp://blondie.com/comics/september-3-2005/ According to comics historian R. C. Harvey, Lebrun was succeeded by John Marshall, although Marshall remained uncredited until Sunday, January 7, 2007. Marshall had been assisting Lebrun and Jeff Parker on the daily Blondie since December 2002. Digital Dagwood During his tenure with Blondie, Lebrun introduced changes to the appearance and production of the strip. Almost immediately after taking the helm, Lebrun began to modernize it by updating Dagwood's wardrobe, replacing dial-tone phones with touch-tone phones, adding computer terminals to Dagwood's place of work and replacing paper charts with digital presentations. In spite of these changes, Lebrun kept the appearance of the strip close to the style of previous Blondie veteran artist Jim Raymond. As early as 1985, Lebrun began to use the computer as a means to streamline and modernize production. Originally, he employed the conventional tools and materials used by earlier Blondie artists: steel pen points (originally Gillot 1290s, later Hunt 103 or 104s for the line work and filed-down Speedball A-2s for lettering), Strathmore two-ply plate finish paper and Pelikan drawing ink. By January 2002, Lebrun made the strip's production fully digital, abandoning paper, pencil and ink in favor of the PowerPC G4.

Name The term \\"Express\\" was coined by James Purdey in 1856, derived from the express train, to publicise the bullet velocity of his double rifles and became common parlance for many rifle cartridges. The addition of the word \\"Nitro\\" stemmed from the propellant used in these cartridges, cordite, which is composed of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Evolution =Early developments= The unveiling of the .450 Nitro Express by John Rigby & Company in 1898 heralded the beginning of the modern big game cartridge. Created from loading the already popular .450 Black Powder Express with cordite, the .450 NE was a fast and accurate cartridge capable of taking all African and Indian dangerous game. Early extraction problems with the .450 NE was the catalyst for Holland & Holland to develop the .500/450 Nitro Express and Eley Brothers the .450 No 2 Nitro Express both with very similar ballistics and performance to the original.Hailey. Rigby soon solved the problems with the .450 NE which quickly became the standard big-game cartridge used throughout Britain‚Äôs African colonies and India. With the success of the .450 NE, various people (it is not clear who) decided to follow Rigby‚Äôs example and load the old .450/400 Black Powder Express, .500 Black Powder Express and .577 Black Powder Express cartridges with cordite, creating the .450/400 Nitro Express, .500 Nitro Express and .577 Nitro Express, the latter two offering greater power than the .450s at the expense of greater rifle weight and recoil. In 1903 Jeffery & Co decided to outdo them all, creating the .600 Nitro Express, the most powerful sporting cartridge commercially available for over half a century.Wieland. Whilst more powerful, the .500, .577 and .600 NE rifles were all too heavy for everyday use and remained specialist tools for the professional hunter, the .450s remained the most popular, but political events were to soon change this. =1907 British ban= In the late 1890s, the British Empire was facing a series of internal insurrections in India and the Sudan, and the .450 calibre .577/450 Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle was the most widely distributed firearm in the hands of the anti-British forces. In 1907 the British Army banned all .450 calibre sporting rifles and ammunition from importation into India and East Africa, the two major destinations for .450 NE rifles and ammunition. Whilst the .450 cartridges could not be loaded into a Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle, it was feared the bullets could be pulled and used to reload expended .577/.450 cartridges. What resulted was a rush by British rifle and ammunition makers to develop a substitute, Holland & Holland created the .500/465 Nitro Express, Joseph Lang the .470 Nitro Express, an unidentified firm the .475 Nitro Express, Eley Brothers the .475 No 2 Nitro Express and Westley Richards the .476 Nitro Express, with the .470 NE becoming the most popular. =Rise of the Mauser= In 1899 Rigby approached the engineers at Mauser to make a special Gewehr 98 bolt action to handle their .400/350 Nitro Express. The introduction of this rifle in 1900 was the birth of the magnum length bolt action, paving the way for such cartridges as the .375 H&H; and .416 RigbyJohn Rigby & Co.

The locomotives were developed as part of the railroad's New York Tunnel Extension, which built the original Pennsylvania Station in New York City and linked it to New Jersey via the North River Tunnels. The Pennsylvania built a total of 66 locomotives in its Altoona Works; they operated in semi-permanently coupled pairs. Westinghouse supplied the electrical equipment. The first locomotives entered service in 1910, with the opening of Pennsylvania Station. They operated between Manhattan Transfer and Pennsylvania Station, and from there to the coach yards at Sunnyside Yard in Queens, New York. With the arrival of the Class L5 locomotives in 1924 some DD1s moved to the Pennsylvania-owned Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), which had substantial electrified commuter rail operations. The conversion of the New York‚ÄìPhiladelphia main line to alternating current in the 1930s saw the remainder of the DD1s scrapped or transferred to the LIRR. One pair, Nos. 3936 and 3937, is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Design Each semi-permanently coupled pair had a length of and weighed . DD1-class locomotives were nearly always operated as a pair--never individually and rarely as two pairs in a double-heading configuration. The PRR classed their 4-4-0 locomotives as class D, and the DD1 was essentially two 4-4-0 locomotives coupled back to back, resulting in the new class, DD. Each pair was assigned a single \\"Electrified Zone Number\\" (EZN); the EZN simplified train dispatching for each pair of DD1s while their original individual serial numbers were used for the mechanical records of the locomotives. Each locomotive had its own Westinghouse 315-A, direct current, commutating pole, electric motors within a monocoque cab. The motors had a continuous power rating of at , and could produce up to at for no more than an hour. Their top speed was , but PRR/LIRR timetables had a speed limit of . The motors were connected to the two drivers via a jackshaft and coupling rods. The design of the DD1 served as a transition between steam locomotives and modern electric locomotives. Despite their ungainly appearance, DD1s ran \\"quietly and smoothly...with no appreciable rod clanking\\", and had a very low maintenance cost. DD1 locomotives operated off of 650 volt direct current from a third rail.  History  The first DD1-class of locomotives were introduced into regular passenger service on November 27, 1910 to operate in the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River. As steam locomotives were prohibited from entering the tunnels, the electric DD1 shuttled passengers from the Pennsylvania Railroad's Manhattan Transfer station in New Jersey and Pennsylvania Station in New York City. A total of 66 locomotives were constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad's Juniata Shops in Altoona starting 1909; 3936 and 3937 were put into service in 1911. As the new L5s were being introduced in 1924, most DD1s were transferred to the Long Island Rail Road. Both 3936 and 3937 were shifted from mainline passenger duty, and hauled the empty passenger trains from Pennsylvania Station to the Sunnyside Yard. The Long Island Rail Road scrapped most of their DD1s from 1949 to 1951, and only two pairs remained in 1962. By 1978, Nos. 3936 and 3937 comprised the last existing DD1 and were donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, by the Pennsylvania's successor Penn Central as part of a collection with twelve other historically significant locomotives. Both locomotives were jointly listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979.

Biography He was born in Berlin, but spent most of his childhood in Florence. His family moved to Milan in 1909, and here he worked on the Letteratura magazine, frequenting avant-garde circles and making the acquaintance of Boccioni and Carr√†. In 1914 the Futurist magazine Lacerba published his \\"Giornale + Strada ‚Äì Parole in libert√†\\" (\\"Journal + Road ‚Äì Free speech\\"). During World War I Campigli was captured and deported to Hungary where he remained a prisoner of war from 1916‚Äì18. At the end of the war he moved to Paris where he worked as foreign correspondent for the Milanese daily newspaper Corriere della Sera. Although he had already produced some drawings during the war, it was only after he arrived in Paris that he started to paint. At the Caf√© du D√¥me he consorted with artists including Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Savinio, Gino Severini and Filippo De Pisis. Extended visits to the Louvre deepened Campigli's interest in ancient Egyptian art, which became a lasting source of his own painting. His first figurative works applied geometrical designs to the human figure, reflecting the influence of Pablo Picasso and Fernand L√©ger as well as the Purism of \\"L‚ÄôEsprit Nouveau\\". In 1923, he organised his first personal exhibition at the Bragaglia Gallery in Rome. During the next five years his figures developed a monumental quality, often with stylised poses and the limbs interwoven into a sculptural solidity. The importance given to order and tradition, the atmosphere of serenity and eternity were in line with the post-war reconstruction and the programme of the ‚ÄúTwentieth Century‚Äù artists with whom Campigli frequently exhibited both in Milan from 1926‚Äì29 and abroad from 1927‚Äì31. As from 1926, he joined the \\"Paris Italians\\" together with de Chirico, de Pisis, Renato Paresce, Savinio, Severini and Mario Tozzi. In 1928, year of his debut at the Venice Biennial, he was very much taken by the Etruscan collection when visiting the National Etruscan Museum in Rome. He then broke away from the compact severity of his previous works in favour of a plane with subdued tones and schematic forms rich in archaisms. While in Paris Campigli worked at Atelier 17. During a journey in Romania with his first wife Magdalena RƒÉdulescu, he started a new cycle of works portraying women employed in domestic tasks and agricultural labour. These figures were arranged in asymmetrical and hieratic compositions, hovering on a rough textured plane, inspired by ancient fresco. These works were enthusiastically received by the critics at the exhibition held in the Jeanne Bucher gallery, Paris, in 1929 and at the Milione Gallery, Milan, in 1931. During the ‚Äòthirties he held a series of solo exhibitions in New York, Paris and Milan which brought him international acclaim. Mural by Campigli (Palais des Nations, Geneva) In 1933 Campigli returned to Milan where he worked on projects of vast dimensions. In the same year he signed Mario Sironi‚Äôs Mural Art Manifesto and painted a fresco of mothers, country-women, working women, for the V Milan Triennial which unfortunately was later destroyed. In the following ten years other works were commissioned: I costruttori (\\"The builders\\") for the Geneva League of Nations in 1937; Non uccidere (\\"Do not kill\\") for the Milan Courts of Justice in 1938, an enormous 300 square metre fresco for the entrance hall, designed by Gio Ponti, of the Liviano, Padua which he painted during 1939‚Äì40. After divorcing in 1939, Campigli remarried with the sculptor Giuditta Scalini. Together they passed the war years in Milan and in Venice, then after the war they divided their time between Rome, Paris and Saint-Tropez. In 1943, his son Nicola was born in Venice. In a personal exhibition at the Venice Biennial in 1948 he displayed his new compositions: female figures inserted in complicated architectonic structures. During the 60s his figures were reduced to coloured markings in a group of almost abstract canvasses. In 1967 a retrospective exhibition was dedicated to Campigli at the Palazzo Reale in Milan. He died of a heart attack in 1971 in Saint-Tropez. <gallery caption=\\"Photos by Paolo Monti> Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6361508.jpgMassimo Campigli References External links *Official web site * (Video Un'ora con Massimo Campigli, Incontri, RAI 1969) * (Video Massimo Campigli il grande solitario, prodotto dalla 3M Italia a cura di Nicola Campigli) *The State Hermitage Museum *Museo d'Arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto *Camera dei deputati Roma *Xseven Art *\\"Scrupoli\\" di Massimo Campigli E_Book Category:1895 births Category:1971 deaths Category:20th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:20th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Atelier 17, alumni ","title":"Massimo Campigli"},{"id":"3624358","text":"Jack Williams Hayford (born June 25, 1934) is an American author, Pentecostal minister, and Chancellor Emeritus of The King's University (formerly The King's College and Seminary).

ISSN 0006-2510  Biography  Jack Williams Hayford was born on June 25, 1934, in Los Angeles, California, to Anita Delores (n√©e Farnsworth) (1916-1997) and Jack Hayford (1911-1979), who had married two years earlier on September 28, 1932. Hayford was born with a muscular condition in his neck, however his condition improved. His father had served in the military as a young man and served as a switchman for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Hayford's mother, Dolores, was a Bible teacher who spoke at interdenominational women's classes and Women's Aglow Fellowship (now Aglow International). Although Hayford's parents did not always attend church, he has credited them with providing him with a Christian upbringing. = Education = Although he was born in Los Angeles, Hayford was raised in Oakland, California and attended Oakland Technical High School. After graduating in 1952, Hayford moved back to Los Angeles to attend Life Pacific University (formerly \\"L.I.F.E. Bible College\\") and received his first bachelor's degree in 1956. Subsequently, after serving as the National Youth Director of International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, he joined the faculty of L.I.F.E. and went on to become dean of students there. During this time, he began working on his second bachelor's degree at Azusa Pacific University (APU), where he graduated in 1970. Over the course his life, he has also been awarded a few honorary degrees, including Doctor of Divinity from both L.I.F.E. and Oral Roberts University, and Doctor of Literature from California Graduate School of Theology. = Pastorate = In 1969, while serving as dean of students at L.I.F.E. and finishing his degree at APU, Hayford was asked to pastor a small congregation, the first Foursquare Church of Van Nuys, California, a struggling congregation of only 18 members, with an average age of 65 years. While Hayford had initially agreed to pastor the church for only a period of six months, he later felt compelled to remain on a permanent basis. Only a few weeks from accepting an offer to pastor another Foursquare church, Hayford met with Foursquare denomination president, Rolf McPherson, stating that he wanted to remain with the Van Nuys congregation. By the early 1980s, The Church on the Way became a pioneer of the megachurch movement and numbered among the largest churches in America, and particularly, the Foursquare denomination, at one point reporting membership exceeding 10,000. His dear friend, actor Dean Jones (deceased) was an elder in Hayford's church, as was Pat Boone, along with Jan and Paul Crouch, the founders of Trinity Broadcasting Network, which regularly broadcast services from the Church. = Latter Years = In the late 1990s, Hayford felt called to establish a Pentecostal seminary in Los Angeles to train other pastors and founded The King's College and Seminary. In 1999, he resigned as the senior pastor of The Church On The Way to focus on the college, although he briefly returned to help the church through a difficult transition after his successor and son-in-law, Scott Bauer, suddenly died. On October 4, 2004, Hayford was elected to a four-year term as president of the Foursquare denomination, a position he chose not to pursue after that single term. In 2013, Hayford felt called to move the Kings University to Southlake, Texas, under the stewardship of Gateway Church, leaving Los Angeles without a Pentecostal college within its boundaries. In 2015, The Church On The Way, led by senior pastor, Tim Clark, honored Hayford with the title of Pastor Emeritus in recognition of his continuing contributions to church governance and oversight.  Personal life  On July 4, 1954, Hayford married his college sweetheart, Anna Marie Smith. Their marriage produced four children (Rebecca, Jack III, Mark, and Christa), 11 grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren. In early 2016, Anna was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, succumbing to the disease early in 2017. Hayford, now remarried continues to live in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles.  Recognition  In March 2014, he was inducted into the Religious Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.NRB Hall of Fame Award Winner Jack Hayford Calls on Christians to Love One Another He has also won the Gospel Music Association's Dove Award for his part in the album, God With Us and the Salvation Army's William Booth Award.

Lacey and His Friends is a 1986 compilation of science fiction short stories by American writer David Drake, published in 1986 by Baen Books. It contains five stories, three of which are about the titular Jed Lacey, a ruthless individual, convicted for raping a former contemporary as an act of revenge for betraying him, turned detective by a computer that allocates people to work in areas where their \\"psych profile\\" indicates they will be effective. The other stories are two unconnected, time travel stories. Lacey lives in a world of constant sousveillance and surveillance.

Blyth is north of London and west of Waterloo at the intersection of Huron County Road 4 (London Road) and Huron County Road 25 (Blyth Road). Blyth is also inland from Lake Huron. The 2016 Canadian Census showed Blyth had a population of approximately 1,000 residents. Despite its small size, Blyth has a significant national presence. The village attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors annually to its world-renowned theatre, destination craft brewery and large municipal campground. As well, Blyth has several prominent employers creating job opportunities not found in many rural regions of Canada. Residents pronounce the name of their village \\"blithe\\" rather than \\"bly-eth\\". History The first European settlers, Lucius McConnell and Kenneth McBean, arrived in what is now Blyth in 1851. The first store was opened by John Templeton. In 1854, John Drummond built the first hotel (present-day site of The Blyth Inn). A shoe shop, blacksmith shop, tailor shop and sawmill were all set up around the same time. By 1855, a layout for the village of Drummond was made, however the village was renamed Blyth in recognition of British land speculator Henry Blyth. In 1856, a post office was established and until 1891, the postal service officially, and incorrectly, spelled Blyth with an \\"e\\" on the end (Blythe). Henry Blyth never visited the village. By the mid-1860s, Blyth's businesses included a grist and flour mill, steam sawmill, 4 general stores, stove and tinshop, carriage and wagon factory, 3 blacksmith shops, a saddlery, a tailor shop, 3 shoe shops, a cooper shop, 3 hotels and one medical doctor. In 1876, the first train service, The London, Huron and Bruce Railway, came to Blyth. One year later, the village was incorporated with a population of approximately 800 residents. The community's first elected reeve was Patrick Kelly. In 1877, a two-room public school was built and opened. In the 1890s, a chopping mill and cider press were opened. Other early businesses in Blyth included a bake shop, a cement block making shop, a Massey Harris implement shop, a livery, a dressmaker shop, the cooper shop that made renowned apple barrels. In 1896, a four-room public school was constructed at the corner of King and Wellington Streets. In 1907, a stop of the Canadian Pacific Railway line from Guelph to Goderich was established in Blyth. The daily train included a passenger coach with daily connections through to Toronto. The last train was in 1988, and the rail line is now the Guelph to Goderich (G2G) trail. In 1920, construction began on the Blyth Memorial Hall, a joint effort by residents of Blyth and the Townships of East Wawanosh, Morris and Hullett. The Hall aimed to commemorate the lives of local World War 1 soldiers who died in the war. The sod was first turned and first cornerstone laid on July 28, 1920. The Hall placed 600 opera chairs in its auditorium and construction costs were estimated at $25,000. The Hall was frequently used in its early days for \\"banquets, council meetings, wedding receptions, Division Court Sessions, community dances\\" along with vaudeville productions, community musicals and local talent shows. However, interest in the Hall waned by the mid-1950s, and the auditorium was rarely used and eventually condemned. A local group of citizens campaigned and fundraised to renovate it. In 1975, the Blyth Festival produced its first professional theatre production in Blyth. The summer theatre eventually turned into the Blyth Centre for the Arts, incorporating an art gallery, choir and orchestra. In 2001 Blyth amalgamated with East Wawanosh Township and Wingham to form the Township of North Huron. Today, Blyth is a rural Canadian success story. The village has been recognized as a model for Canadian rural communities who incorporate arts and culture to diversify community economy to move beyond solely an agriculture- based model.

It is an adaptation of the novel Tsotsi, by Athol Fugard and is a South African/UK co-production. Set in the Alexandra slum in Johannesburg, South Africa, it stars Presley Chweneyagae as David/Tsotsi (Tsotsitaal name for \\"criminal\\"), a young street thug who steals a car only to discover a baby in the back seat. It also features Terry Pheto, Kenneth Nkosi, Jerry Mofokeng and Rapulana Seiphemo in supporting roles. The soundtrack for the film features Kwaito music performed by South African artist Zola as well as a score by Mark Kilian and Paul Hepker featuring the voice of South African protest singer and poet Vusi Mahlasela. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise primarily aimed at its writing, direction, performances, particularly Chweneyagae and Pheto's, cinematography and emotional weight. It went on to win the 2006 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first South African film and first African film not made in the French language to win the former. In 2009, it was unofficially remade in Tamil language as Yogi. Plot Since his mother is dying of a terminal disease, David (Benny Moshe) runs away from an abusive father and lives with other homeless children in a series of large concrete construction pipes. A few years later, David, who now goes by the name Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae), is the leader of a gang which includes his friends Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). After getting involved in a murder committed by Butcher during a mugging, Tsotsi and Boston get into a fight which leaves Boston badly injured. Tsotsi later shoots Pumla (Nambitha Mpumlwana), a young woman, while stealing her car, only to discover a three-month-old baby boy in the back seat. Tsotsi hastily strips the car of its valuables and takes the baby back to his shack. Pumla survives the attack and works with a police artist to create a composite sketch of Tsotsi's face, which is then run in the newspapers. Realizing that he cannot properly care for the baby on his own, Tsotsi spots Miriam (Terry Pheto), with a young child strapped to her back, collecting water from a public tap. He follows her to her shack and forces her at gunpoint to feed the kidnapped child. Meanwhile, rich gang leader Fela (Zola) begins attempting to recruit Aap, Boston and Butcher to work for him. When Tsotsi takes the child to Miriam a second time, she asks him to leave the boy with her so that she can care for him on Tsotsi's behalf, and Tsotsi agrees. Tsotsi decides to take care of the injured Boston, and has Aap and Butcher take Boston to his shack. Boston, who is called Teacher Boy by his friends, explains that he never took the teachers' examination. Tsotsi tells him that the gang will raise the money so that Boston can take the exam, which means they will have to commit another robbery. Tsotsi and Aap go to Pumla's house. When Pumla's husband John (Rapulana Seiphemo) returns from the hospital, they follow him into the house and tie him up. Aap is assigned to watch John while Butcher ransacks the bedroom and Tsotsi collects items from the baby's room. When Aap goes to raid the fridge, John activates the alarm. In a panic, Butcher attempts to kill John with John's pistol that he found. Tsotsi shoots and kills Butcher with his pistol. He and Aap escape in John's car moments before the security company arrives. Traumatized by Tsotsi's killing of Butcher and fearing that Tsotsi will one day harm him too, Aap decides to leave the gang and quit as Tsotsi's friend. When Tsotsi goes back to Miriam's house she reveals that she knows where he got the baby, and begs him to return the child to his parents. Tsotsi sets off to return the baby. He reaches John's house, tells John over the intercom that he will leave the child outside the gate. Meanwhile, an officer stationed at the house alerts Captain Smit (Ian Roberts), who rushes to the scene, arriving just as Tsotsi is about to walk away. The police train their guns on Tsotsi, ordering him to return the baby. However, John urges them to lower their weapons so that he can retrieve the baby himself. As Tsotsi holds the baby in his arms, John convinces him to give up the baby. Tsotsi emotionally hands the baby to John, then is told to put up his hands and turns himself in as the film ends. =Alternate endings= The film ends with Tsotsi raising his hands, and does not disclose what happens thereafter. Two unused endings were shot for the film, which can be seen on the Tsotsi DVD. In one, Tsotsi is shot in the shoulder, and while the officers are shocked at what happened, he escapes through a large field back to the Alexandra slums after avoiding another shot from the chief police officer. In the other, Tsotsi is shot in the chest while reaching for a milk bottle he brought. He collapses and dies while John and Pumla look on in horror. Cast * Presley Chweneyagae as David / Tsotsi: The anti-heroic leader of a gang of small-time thugs. His name, in Tsotsitaal, means \\"thug\\" or \\"criminal\\". * Mothusi Magano as Boston / Teacher boy: A member of Tsotsi's gang and a heavy drinker, Boston was studying to be a teacher before he quit college and moved to the shacks. He frequently pleads for decency and moderation in the gang's dealings. * Kenneth Nkosi as Aap: Tsotsi's childhood friend. Aap is obedient and happy-go-lucky, and relies on Tsotsi heavily, rarely thinking for himself. His name, in Afrikaans and Tsotsitaal, means \\"monkey\\". * Zenzo Ngqobe as Butcher: The fourth member of Tsotsi's gang, and the most violent, Butcher is a cheat and a loose cannon who does not hesitate to commit murder. * Jerry Mofokeng as Morris: A beggar who worked in the gold mines until he was permanently crippled when a beam fell on his legs. * Terry Pheto as Miriam: A widow with a young son who lives near Tsotsi in the slum. * Nambitha Mpumlwana as Pumla Dube: The mother of the kidnapped child. * Rapulana Seiphemo as John Dube: The father of the kidnapped child. * Ian Roberts as Captain Smit: An Afrikaner police captain. * Thembi Nyandeni as Soekie * Israel Makoe as Tsotsi's father Reception =Box office= The film opened in a limited release in North America on 24 February 2006 in 6 theatres and ultimately was shown in 122 theatres for a lifetime worldwide gross of $11.54 million. =Critical response= The film received positive reviews from critics and has a \\"certified fresh\\" score of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 128 reviews with an average score of 7.4 out of 10. The critical consensus states \\"Chweneyagae's powerful performance carries this simple yet searing tale of a shantytown prostitute redemption.\\" The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 35 critics indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating and stated in his review \\" How strange, a movie where a bad man becomes better, instead of the other way around. \\"Tsotsi,\\" a film of deep emotional power, considers a young killer whose cold eyes show no emotion, who kills unthinkingly, and who is transformed by the helplessness of a baby. He didn't mean to kidnap the baby, but now that he has it, it looks at him with trust and need, and he is powerless before eyes more demanding than his own. [...] How the story develops is for you to discover. I was surprised to find that it leads toward hope instead of despair; why does fiction so often assume defeat is our destiny?\\" Tsotsi won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006 and also won an Oscar for best picture. Gavin Hood was also nominated for the 2005 Non-European Film ‚Äì Prix Screen International at the European Film Awards for his work on the film.

Jeffery & Co for the purpose of hunting large game such as elephant. Design The .600 Nitro Express is a slightly tapered walled, rimmed, centerfire rifle cartridge designed for use in single-shot and double rifles. The cartridge fires a diameter, projectile with three powder loadings, the standard being of cordite at a muzzle velocity of , whilst there is also a loading which generates muzzle velocity of and a loading which generates a muzzle velocity of . Because of the recoil forces generated by this cartridge, rifles chambered in it typically weigh up to . History The .600 Nitro Express was developed by London gunmakers W.J. Jeffery & Co. Sources vary about the date of its introduction, although it would seem in 1900 the first .600 Nitro Express rifle was produced by W.J. Jeffery & Co, a double barrelled hammer rifle. Jefferys produced around seventy rifles in .600 Nitro Express in four actions, double barrelled hammer break-open, single barrelled break-open, falling block and double barrelled break-open with and without ejectors. Until the introduction of the .700 Nitro Express in 1988, the .600 Nitro Express was the most powerful commercially available hunting rifle cartridge in the world. Aside from W.J. Jeffery & Co, several gunmakers have and continue to offer rifles chambering this .600 Nitro Express, although in 2009 it was estimated by Holland & Holland that only around one hundred .600 Nitro Express rifles have ever been produced to that time. =WWI service= In 1914 and early 1915, German snipers were engaging British Army positions with impunity from behind steel plates that were impervious to .303 British ball ammunition. In an attempt to counter this threat, the British War Office purchased sixty-two large bore sporting rifles from British rifle makers, including four .600 Nitro Express rifles, which were issued to Regiments. These large bore rifles proved very effective against the steel plates used by the Germans, in his book Sniping in France 1914-18 MAJ H. Hesketh-Prichard, DSO, MC stated they \\"pierced them like butter.\\" Stuart Cloete, sniping officer for the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, stated \\"We used a heavy sporting rifle - a .600 Express. These had been donated to the army by big game hunters and when we hit a plate we stove it right in. But it had to be fired standing or from a kneeling position to take up the recoil. The first man who fired it from the prone position had his collar bone broken.\\" Use The .600 Nitro Express, along with the .577 Nitro Express, was a specialist backup weapon for professional elephant hunters. Too heavy to be carried all day and used effectively, it was usually carried by a gun bearer. It was used when in thick cover and when an effective shot at the heart and lungs was not possible. In his African Rifles and Cartridges, John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor says the shock of a head shot from a .600 Nitro Express bullet is enough to knock an elephant out for up to half an hour. =Prominent users= In the course of his career \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor owned and used two .600 Nitro Express double rifles, the first was regulated for 110 gr loadings, the second was a W.J. Jeffery & Co double rifle that weighed 16 lb with barrels and was regulated for 100 gr loadings. He states he was very fond of his Jeffery .600 which he used as a second backup rifle to a Jeffery .400 Jeffery Nitro Express, and with it he killed between 60 and 70 elephants. Bror von Blixen-Finecke, Karl Larsen and Major Percy Powell-Cotton all used W.J. Jeffery & Co .600 Nitro Express rifles extensively. Appearances in Film In the film The Lost World: Jurassic Park one of the main characters (Roland Tembo) uses a Searcy Double Barrel Rifle chambered in .600 Nitro Express. =Parent case= In 1929 Holland & Holland produced the .600/577 Rewa by necking down the .600 Nitro Express to accept a bullet.

History Bang Khen was established as an amphoe (district) of Phra Nakhon Province in 1897. The district occupied a vast plain called Thung Bang Khen (‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πà‡∏á‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏ô; 'Bang Khen Field') in north Bangkok. Farms dominated its landscape. In October 1933, the district was a battleground in the \\"Boworadet rebellion\\" contested by the army of Prince Boworadet and government troops. Its name \\"Bang Khen\\" is said to be distorted from the word Bang Ken (‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πá‡∏ô; 'Place of Push'). It originated from a folk tale titled \\"Legend of Lord Uthong\\" (‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏≠‡∏π‡πà‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á) when a gold tanker of Lord Uthong (not King Uthong of Ayutthaya) ran aground in a local canal. Therefore having to push [ken in Thai] a tanker to pass through with tangle. In 1972, Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces were combined and called Krung Thep Maha Nakhon. Administrative units within the capital were renamed \\"districts\\" (khet) and \\"sub-district\\" (khwaeng), replacing \\"amphoe\\" and \\"tambon\\" respectively. Bang Khen became a district in the newly combined province. At that time it had eight sub- districts. Bang Khen was once a very large district, but has been reduced in size after several modifications to district boundaries. In 1989, western and southwestern portions were split off to create Don Mueang District and Chatuchak District respectively. In 1997, a northern portion of Bang Khen was split off to create Sai Mai District, but in the same reorganization Bang Khen received Moo 8-10 of Chorakhe Bua Sub-district from Lat Phrao District. the Thai Army's 11th Infantry Division occupies 3,000 rai (1,185 acres) of land in Bang Khen.

It effectively nullified the constitution and established martial law in Taiwan, where civil and political freedoms were curtailed. The official rationale for the provisions was the ongoing Chinese Civil War, but with the demise of the Kuomintang single-party system, the provisions were repealed. History The current Constitution of the Republic of China was adopted by the National Assembly in 1947, when the Nationalist Government was based in Nanjing. Since 1945, China was engulfed in a civil war that pitted the Nationalist Government against the Communist Party of China (CPC). In March 1948, the first National Assembly met in Nanjing, and after some deliberation, decided to invoke Article 174 of the Constitution to amend the Constitution\\". On 10 May 1948, the Assembly adopted the first set of Temporary Provisions that was set to expire after three years. In 1949, the Communists expelled the Nationalist Government from mainland China, and Chiang's government set up base in Taipei, Taiwan. In 1954, the National Assembly indefinitely renewed the Temporary Provisions in view of the Kuomintang's plans to recapture the mainland. The Temporary Provisions from then on were amended in accordance with the needs of the President of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, or his son Chiang Ching Kuo. In 1966, the Temporary Provisions were revised to allow for supplementary elections to the National Assembly from the Taiwan Area. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations and replaced with representatives from the People's Republic of China; the Temporary Provisions were amended again the same year. =Abolition= It became clear that retaking the mainland was not a real possibility. On 22 April 1991, the National Assembly resolved to abolish the Temporary Provisions, and on April 30 of the same year, President Lee Teng-hui declared the end of the Mobilization for Suppression of Communist Rebellion as of May 1. The repeal of the provisions caused some ambiguity in cross-strait relations and the political status of Taiwan, raising questions such as whether the \\"Communist rebellion\\" has \\"succeeded\\" and so the PRC government is recognized as legitimate by the ROC, or whether it would be legal now for the CPC to operate in Taiwan. Provisions The Temporary Provisions allowed for the creation of the Taiwan Garrison Command and the National Security Council, both for the purpose of enforcing martial law. The provisions also allowed the President and Vice President of the Republic of China to be exempted from the two-term office limit. Extensive powers given to the president by the Temporary Provisions turned the ROC into a de facto presidential system, where the President also held the post of chairman of the Kuomintang, although the Constitution originally laid out a parliamentary system. Specifically, the provision relating to the president said: > In this Period of Communist Rebellion, for the sake of avoiding the emergent > political crisis, and addressing the mammoth economic change, the president > is empowered to adopt emergency measures through a resolution of a cabinet > meeting of the Executive Yuan. The president's power will not be limited by > the regular procedures of Articles 39 and 43 of the constitution.

Rules  The so- called plundering occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing chess piece and \\"plunders\\" or \\"acquires\\" additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured. Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture. When plundering is elected, the capturing piece \\"couples\\" or \\"attaches\\" to itself a vest that corresponds to the moving capabilities it is acquiring from the captured piece. The plundered vest must give added moving capabilities to the piece that wears it or it will not be allowed to plunder. This means that a queen can never wear a rook vest because a queen can already make the moves of a rook and a rook vest provides no additional benefit to the queen. The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move: i.e., the plundered vest may be used on its very next move or carried around and used later in the game. After a vest is used to move a chess piece on the board, it must be returned to the stand out of play. No more than one plundered vest is allowed on any one piece at a time. If a chess piece with a plundered vest makes another capture, it may upgrade to a stronger vest. If a player captures a piece with a vest, that player may take the vest it wears or a vest that represents the captured piece. The pawn with the vest can use it to reach the last rank. In this case the pawn gets immediately promoted. However, the pieces with pawn vest cannot promote. The pawn can also move to the first rank by a vest move. But it has double-move capability only when moving from 2nd to 4th rank. A piece with a vest can give a check (or eventually checkmate) to the opponent's king using vest-move power.

It was established in 1985 following the amalgamation of Heath Grammar School and Crossley and Porter School. It is part of The Crossley Heath School Academy Trust Limited.  History  The Crossley Heath School was established in 1985 following the amalgamation of Heath Grammar School and Crossley and Porter School. = Heath Grammar School = Heath Grammar School, Free School Lane, Halifax, West Yorkshire was founded in 1585 by Dr. John Favour. Its full title was The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth. Henry Farror and his brother gave of land in Skircoat Green and personally obtained the school charter from Elizabeth I of England at his own expense. Dr Favour became the Vicar of Halifax in 1593. The original governors selected from among the most respectable of the parishioners were responsible for the appointment of the head master and usher the former of whom must have been a student for a period of five years at one of the Universities. The school house with of land contiguous to it was given by Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury, Edward Savile Esq and Sir George Savile Knt in 1598 and several benefactions have since been added to the original endowment among which is one by the Rev Thomas Milner who by will in 1722 assigned to the Master and Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge, a reversionary grant of ¬£1000 for founding three scholarships for the benefit of the schools at Haversham, Leeds and Halifax and in 1736 his sister added ¬£200 for the same purpose. The head master received ¬£80 per annum, out of which he paid an usher of his own appointment. The seal of Heath Grammar School shows a book with the Latin words: \\"Qui mihi discipulus puer es cupis atque\\" which translates to \\"You who are my pupil and wish to be taught\\". The main school is now a listed Building. = Crossley and Porter School = In 1857 Frank (later Sir Francis Crossley, 1st Baronet) and John Crossley, of Dean Clough Mills, founded an orphanage through capital of ¬£56,000 and a further endowment of ¬£50,000. In 1887, after a gift of ¬£50,000 from Thomas Porter, a Manchester yarn merchant, the orphanage was extended to include schooling. Over time, the need for an orphanage decreased and the school became a grammar school. The building was designed by John Hogg, a local architect. At the time of the 1881 census,Census returns for Skircoat, 1841‚Äì1891. UK Public Records Office RG11/408/102 pg 1. (Online transcription ) Head master William Cambridge Barber, assisted by a Matron, Head mistress, and 8 assistant masters and mistresses, presided over a population of 216 \\"scholar orphans.\\" They included 84 girls and 132 boys, ranging in age from 7 to 16. They were mostly English born, but included a few Irish as well as children from as far away as Australia. A Royal Charter of 31 January 1887, named the institution The Crossley and Porter Orphan Home and School. In 1919 the school was given royal permission to admit day pupils. There were two sections ‚Äì the Crossley and Porter Boys' School, with around 300 boys, and the Crossley and Porter Girls' School, with around 450 girls, administered by the County Borough of Halifax. In 1967, it became the co-educational Crossley and Porter School with around 800 girls and boys. = The Crossley Heath School = The amalgamation required a re-organisation of the two sets of staff, the net outcome being the former Headmaster of Crossley and Porter, Paul Barker, became the Head of the new school with John Bunch, former acting Head of Heath becoming Deputy Headmaster. The first intake of true Crossley Heath students arrived on Tuesday 27 August 1985. The initial intake was circa 90 pupils; a reduction from the previous intakes of Crossley and Porter and Heath intakes by around 50 pupils. The school was initially located on two sites, the former Heath Grammar School building (initially referred to as the Crossley Heath Annex but later changed to the Crossley Heath 6th Form Centre) and the Crossley and Porter School building. The former Heath building initially housed the combined sixth forms of the two schools, plus the combined fourth form, with all other years being housed at Savile Park. As the number of pupils reduced over the coming years, the 6th form and 4th form were relocated to the Savile Park site and the Free School Lane site was passed over to the local authority to become a training centre. Throughout this period, the staff head count was also reduced to reflect the smaller number of pupils. The school became a Specialist Language College in 2003. In 2006 it was designated a Language College and a second specialism as a Leadership Partner school was granted in 2007. In 2010 a sports hall was built, which provided an extra sport and dance facility (supplementing the two Victorian gymnasia) for students and staff. It also provides a space in which the whole school can congregate. The school converted to academy status in January 2013. In 2015, headteacher Wendy Moffat announced plans for a new sixth form block to replace the existing ageing facilities had been approved and construction was to begin immediately. Construction took just over a year and the building opened to students in early 2016.  Today  = Admission = The school entrance examination, administered jointly with North Halifax Grammar School, is the 11 plus, taken by prospective pupils in September of Year 6 to determine academic ability and attainment; those not achieving a high enough grade can appeal to Calderdale council. Those who apply to enter the school between the years 7 and 11 are required to pass examinations in English, Mathematics, Science and a chosen Modern Foreign Language. Exceptions are sometimes made for pupils swapping schools in Year 7, or transferring from other grammar schools. To enter the Sixth Form students must achieve higher than GCSE grade C in all compulsory subjects and grade B or higher in all chosen subjects. = School catchment = The area surrounding the Crossley Heath School is relatively prosperous, however the school draws pupils from a wide geographical area, some pupils travelling long distances. The proportion of pupils with special educational needs, and the proportion with statements, is below the national average, as is the proportion of pupils entitled to free school meals. = Languages = The school teaches French and German within a dedicated building. It also offers Mandarin Chinese to students.https://www.crossleyheath.org.uk/curriculum-and-assessment/mandarin- excellence-program/ = Technology = In 2005 the school built a new technology block with five classrooms to accommodate graphics, electronics, resistant materials, textiles and food technology, and a dedicated music technology IT suite. = Sport = The school has a number of sports teams. Athletics, cross country, hockey, cricket, football and rugby teams have won competitions locally, nationally and internationally. The Boys Rugby and Girls Netball teams have toured all around the world. = Houses = Students belong to one of four houses; Porter, Savile (derived from the Crossley and Porter School ‚Äì the houses of Crossley and Standeven were dropped in the merger), Kings and Queens (derived from Heath Grammar School ‚Äì the houses of Heath and School were dropped in the merger). Competitions between the houses each year include a Sports Day, Swimming Gala, and House Music and House Drama Competitions. Houses and forms also compete to raise money for charities such as Comic Relief, Jeans for Genes and Children in Need.

This cartridge is used almost exclusively in single shot and double express rifles for hunting in the Tropics or hot climates in general and is a cartridge associated with the Golden Age of African safaris and Indian shikars. Design The .577 Nitro Express is a straight rimmed calibre cartridge designed for use in single-shot and double rifles. It has been made in three case lengths based on their respective black-powder .577 Black Powder Express cartridges. =.577 Nitro Express 2¬æ-inch= The .577 Nitro Express 2¬æ-inch is a conversion of the .577 Black Powder Express 2¬æ-inch, it fires a projectile at over . Never as popular as the 3-inch version, today it is only available by special order. =.577 Nitro Express 3-inch= The .577 Nitro Express 3-inch is a conversion of the .577 Black Powder Express 3-inch, it fires a projectile at over . This cartridge was to become the most popular of the three and a standard round for African elephant hunters in the early 20th century. =.577 Nitro Express 3¬º-inch= The .577 Nitro Express 3¬º-inch is a conversion of the .577 Black Powder Express 3¬º-inch, again it was never as popular as the 3-inch version. History Following the success of the development in 1898 of the revolutionary .450 Nitro Express by John Rigby & Company, achieved by loading the old .450 Black Powder Express with cordite, similar conversions were made to other blackpowder Express cartridges, including the .577 Black Powder Express in its various case lengths. Once a standard rifle calibre, the rise of Mauser's Gewehr 98 bolt actioned rifles offered cheaper alternatives to the expensive double rifles required by the Nitro Express cartridges. Several manufacturers still make rifles chambered in .577 Nitro Express, including Butch Searcy & Co., Hambrusch Hunting Weapons, Hartmann & Weiss, Heym, Holland & Holland, James Purdey and Sons and Westley Richards. =WWI service= In 1914 and early 1915, German snipers were engaging British Army positions with impunity from behind steel plates that were impervious to .303 British ball ammunition. In an attempt to counter this threat, the British War Office purchased fifty-two large bore sporting rifles from British rifle makers which were issued to regiments, including two .577 Nitro Express rifles. These large bore rifles proved very effective against the steel plates used by the Germans, in his book Sniping in France 1914-18 MAJ H. Hesketh-Prichard, DSO, MC stated they \\"pierced them like butter.\\" Use The .577 Nitro Express is suitable for hunting all dangerous game, although it was considered something of a specialist elephant hunter's tool for close cover hunting and emergencies, the harsh recoil this round produces requires a rifle of minimum weight. Typically a hunter carried a lighter rifle in a smaller calibre for general hunting whilst a rifle bearer carried a heavy gun such as this, a necessity as an exhausted man could not reliably aim such heavy rifles as these. In his African Rifles and Cartridges, John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor says the .577 Nitro Express is \\"a magnificent killer - it literally crumbles up an elephant\\", further stating the shock of a head shot from a .577 Nitro Express bullet is enough to knock an elephant out for up to 20 minutes. =Prominent users= James H. Sutherland, who over the course of his life shot between 1,300 and 1,600 elephants, stated in his The Adventures of an Elephant Hunter, \\"after experimenting with and using all kinds of rifles, I find the most effective to be the double .577 with a 750 grains bullet and a charge in Axite powder equivalent to a hundred grains of cordite.\\" And further stating \\"I think the superiority of the .577 over the .450 and .500 rifles, will be evident when I state that I have lost elephants with these last two rifles, while I have bagged others with identically the same shots from a .577.‚Äù Pete Pearson with elephant shot with his .577 Nitro Express double rifle Other famous African users include Major G.H. Anderson (shot between 350 and 400 elephants), Deaf Banks (shot over 1,000 elephants), Quentin Grogan, John A. Hunter (shot more than 1,000 rhinoceros) and Pete Pearson (shot over 2,000 elephants). \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor used a Westley Richards .577 Nitro Express double rifle, stating \\"it did great work for me amongst elephant, rhino and buffalo; it's much too powerful for anything lighter.\\" He parted with the rifle after only a short period because the single-trigger mechanism was unlike all of his other rifles. Ernest Hemingway and Alfred J√≥zef Potocki both owned Westley Richards Droplock .577 Nitro Express double rifles, Stewart Granger owned two including Potocki's rifle. =Parent case= * .585 Nyati - developed by turning out the rim and blowing out straight walls of the .577 Nitro Express to allow formation of enough of a shoulder for headspace purposes, making it a \\"rimless\\" version. * .600/570 JDJ - developed by straightening the taper of the .577 Nitro Express to accept diameter bullets from the .600 Nitro Express.

The municipality originally encompassed land that is now part of the municipalities of Bokn and Karm√∏y. It included the southern part of the island of Karm√∏y and the three islands to the east: Vestre Bokn, Austre Bokn, and Ogn√∏ya. In 1849, the three smaller islands were separated to form Bokn municipality. Today, the Skudenes area refers to the southern part of Karm√∏y island. In 2009, there were about 3,226 inhabitants. History The parish of Skudesn√¶s was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1849, the three islands of Vestre Bokn, Austre Bokn, and Ogn√∏ya (population: 1,035) were separated from Skudenes to form the municipality of Bukken. The split left Skudenes with a population of 5,044. In 1857, the port village of Skudeneshavn on the southern tip of the island of Karm√∏y was designated as a ladested (a port of lading). Shortly thereafter, on 10 February 1858, Skudeneshavn (population: 1,209) was separated from Skudenes municipality, constituting a municipality of its own. The split left Skudenes with a population of 5,044. On 1 January 1892 the northern part of Skudenes was split off to form the new municipality of √Ökra (population: 1,962). This left Skudenes with a population of 2,732. On 1 January 1965, there were many municipal mergers in Norway as a result of the Schei Committee's work. On that date, Skudenes municipality (population: 3,583) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Avaldsnes, Stangaland, Torvastad, and √Ökra and with the towns of Kopervik and Skudeneshavn to form the new municipality of Karm√∏y. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Skudenes, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Skudenes was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Life Ellicott was born in Cambridge, the daughter of Constantia Annie Ellicott (n√©e Becher) and Charles Ellicott, the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol. Her father had no interest in music whatsoever and it was predominantly her mother, an amateur singer who had been involved with the founding both of London's Handel Society (1882-1939) and of the Gloucester Philharmonic Society, who encouraged young Rosalind's talent. At the age of six \\"she exhibited an extraordinary facility in music, singing, and harmonising correctly by ear\\". She took lessons from Samuel Sebastian Wesley, the cathedral organist, from age 12, tried writing songs at 13 and then a sonata at 16. From 1874 to 1876 she studied piano with Frederick Westlake at the Royal Academy of Music. While at the Academy she discovered her voice and took soprano solo parts in oratorios and cantatas and was a frequent soloist at the Three Choirs Festival. She also studied composition for seven years from 1885 under Thomas Wingham of the Brompton Oratory. She was a member of the International Society of Musicians and the National Society of Professional Musicians, as well as an ARAM. Subscription required But despite her relative success in the last two decades of the century as a composer and performer, by the early 1900s she began disappearing from the public eye. She moved to the south coast after World War I and died in Seasalter in 1924.Sources differ on this; some state that she died in London, not in Seasalter, although the year given is the same. She is buried near her parents in the churchyard of Birchington-on-Sea, in Kent. Music Rosalind Ellicott by Elliott & Fry (c1870) In 1886 Ellicott found success at the Gloucester Festival with the orchestral Dramatic Overture and then in 1889 with Elysium, a lyrical cantata. Of her Elysium: \\"the orchestration is full and vigorous, the brass specially bold and refreshing, and there is not a dull bar .... It is a charming and spirited work [and received] repeated calls\\". Both of these early works were performed subsequently at concerts in Bristol, Cheltenham, Oxford, London, Dresden and Chicago. It has been suggested that her father's position as a bishop enabled her to have some of her works performed at the Three Choirs Festival (held in rotation in Gloucester, Hereford and Worcester.) However the majority of new composers used patronage from established musicians or other influential people in order to obtain festival premieres. Her ambitious works for chorus and orchestra were cast in a traditional, broadly Romantic vein. But towards the end of the century she began to turn her attention to chamber music, possibly hoping that there would be more opportunities for it to be performed. The Piano Trio No 1 in G received its first performance in Bristol at the end of 1889, with the composer as pianist.Musical Times, January 1990, p 27 The second trio was given at the Gloucester Guildhall on 29 October 1903.Musical Times, 1 December 1903, p 813 The Piano Quartet in B minor and the Violin Sonata were both introduced at the same Steinway Hall concert in London on 28 April 1900, performed by Sybil Palliser, Edie Reynolds, Lionel Tertis and Charles Ould.Musical Times, June 1900, p 399 Her songs and chamber works were regularly performed at the festivals and were generally well-received. She composed rapidly: \\"I get a whole movement in my head before I touch paper. I hardly ever alter my compositions.\\" Comparatively little of Ellicott's work has survived to this day apart from a few songs and instrumental works.

Background The son of an Essex rector, John Smith, and his wife Cecilia Susanna Clementi (daughter of Muzio Clementi), Cecil Clementi Smith received his education at St Paul's School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1864 he began his civil service career as a cadet interpreter in Hong Kong, learning much about the Chinese culture and gradually became an accomplished scholar of the Chinese culture. He was also the Colonial Treasurer of Hong Kong. Civil Service Victoria Concert Hall On 3 September 1878, Clementi Smith took office in Singapore as a Colonial Secretary in the Straits Settlements, and understudied Governor Frederick Weld. His knowledge of Chinese culture and competence in the language proved useful as he was able to communicate effectively with leaders of the growing Chinese community. Smith became known for his effective work in quelling Chinese secret societies in the Straits Settlements, such as those in Singapore which had been terrorising locals for decades. He also established the Queen's Scholarships in 1889 to fund bright Singaporean students to further their studies in top British universities. In 1887 he was appointed Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner to Malaya till 1893. A popular governor, the local Chinese community petitioned for a continuation of his appointment when he left Singapore in 1893. Subsequently, he was Lieutenant Governor of Ceylon, and the Master of the Mercers' Company in 1897. He was president of the commission of inquiry on the Trinidad riots in 1903, and was chief British delegate to International Opium Convention at hague in 1912. Family Clementi Smith married Teresa Alice Newcomen in 1869, they had two children, Beatrice (born ) and Eustace (born c. 1879, and later a lieutenant colonel). Clementi Smith died in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, England, on 6 February 1916, aged 75..

Business 85 is soon to be decommissioned and the route that it travels on will be re-designated only as US 29\\\\. Route description Business 85, which shares a complete concurrency with US 29 and US 70, begins at a partial Y interchange with I-85 (exit 87) in Lexington. Heading north for , along with I-285 and US 52, it goes through another partial Y interchange (exit 87) before leaving the freeway. Changing to a semi-limited expressway, it serves as a northern bypass of downtown Lexington, sharing a brief concurrency with US 64. After leaving the city limits, Business 85 heads in a northeast direction in parallel to I-85 further south. After it travels through Thomasville, it enters the city of High Point in Davidson‚ÄìRandolph county line. Briefly in Randolph County for , it enters Guilford County. East of downtown High Point, Business 85 shares a unique three-level diamond interchange with I-74/US 311 before leaving the city limits. At the Greensboro city limit, Business 85 completes its journey with a trumpet interchange with I-85 (exit 118). History I-40/I-85 Business overhead sign Established in 1984 as redesignation of Temp I-85, Business 85 traversed from Lexington to Greensboro, with complete concurrency with US 29 and US 70, when I-85 was completed on a more southern parallel routing. In May 2005, I-85 was redirected southeast around Greensboro along the Greensboro Urban Loop; its old routing through Greensboro became an extension of Business 85, extending it from to . The extension included a hidden concurrency along I-85 (between exits 118-120A) before split-off again with US 29 and US 70\\\\. In merging onto I-40 (exit 219), it continued easterly before meeting back with I-85 (exit 227) near McLeansville. In October 2018, Business 85 was reverted to its original alignment, ending near Jamestown. The justification was to eliminate a redundant route and decrease the number of routing shields and overhead signs through Greensboro. =Temporary Interstate 85= Temporary Interstate 85 (Temp I-85) was established by 1961 as a temporary designation that directed travelers along US 29/US 70, from the Yadkin River to Greensboro. In 1977, a flyover bridge was completed (dubbed \\"bridge over nothing,\\" it later became part of I-85 exit 87), truncating Temp I-85 south- end near Lexington. In 1984, I-85 was completed on new primary routing between Lexington and Greensboro; Temp I-85 was replaced by I-85 Business. Future On Saturday, October 5, 2019, NCDOT submitted an application to the AASHTO, and received approval, for the decommissioning of I-85 Business along its entire route , as well as the re-routing of US 70 to continue along Wendover Avenue west-bound through Greensboro to NC Highway 68 (Eastchester Drive) in High Point, and then onto NC 68, south-bound from High Point to Thomasville. . Under the state plan, all I-85 Business and US 70 signs will be removed from the freeway stretch traveling southwesterly from Interstate 40 in Greensboro to NC 68 in Thomasville, and the freeway will remain US 29. The state's justification for this is that the route changes will provide a single continuous route as an alternative (US 70 will take on more direct routing through town), simplify overhead signage on the freeway (eliminate confusion between the I-85 bypass and I-85 Business), and remove traffic from interstate concurrencies in order to improve safety and regional connectivity..

She is also thought to be one of the first documented cases of multiple sclerosis.  Life  Lidwina was born in Schiedam, Holland, one of nine children. Her father was a laborer. At age 15, she was ice skating when she fell and broke a rib. She never recovered and became progressively disabled for the rest of her life. Her biographers state that she became paralyzed except for her left hand and that great pieces of her body fell off, and that blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose. Today some posit that Saint Lidwina is one of the first known multiple sclerosis patients and attribute her disability to the effects of the disease and her fall.Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), 124. After her fall, Lidwina fasted continuously and acquired fame as a healer and holy woman. The town officials of Schiedam, her hometown, promulgated a document (which has survived) that attests to her complete lack of food and sleep. At first she ate a little piece of apple, then a bit of date and watered wine, then river water contaminated with salt from the tides. The authenticating document from Schiedam also attests that Lidwina shed skin, bones, parts of her intestines, which her parents kept in a vase and which gave off a sweet odor. These excited so much attention that Lidwina had her mother bury them. Lidwina died at the age of 53. She is known as the patron saint of ice skaters.Harper, Brian. \\"St. Lidwina: A Lesson in Overcoming Suffering\\", Busted Halo, February 21, 2014  Biographies  Johannes Brugman's publication, printed in Schiedam in 1498. Several hagiographical accounts of her life exist. One of these states that while the soldiers of Philip of Burgundy were occupying Schiedam, a guard was set around her to test her fasts, which were authenticated. It is also reported that four soldiers abused her during this occupation, claiming that Lidwina's swollen body was due to her being impregnated by the local priest rather than from her sickness. The well-known German preacher and poet, Friar John Brugman, wrote two Lives of St. Lidwina, the first in 1433, was reprinted anonymously at Leuven in 1448, and later epitomised by Thomas √† Kempis at Cologne in his Vita Lidewigis. The second life appeared at Schiedam in 1498; both have been embodied by the Bollandists in the Acta Sanctorum under 2 April. More recently, in 1901, Joris-Karl Huysmans published a biography of Lidwina.Huysman, J.K., Saint Lydwine of Schiedam: 1380-1433, TAN Books, 1979,  Veneration  Lidwina died in 1434 and was buried in a marble tomb in the chapel of the parish church of Schiedhams which became a place of pilgrimage. Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúBlessed Lidwina, Called Lydwid, Virgin‚Äù. Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866 Thomas √† Kempis's publication caused an increase in veneration. In 1615 her relics were taken to Brussels, but in 1871 they were returned to Schiedam. On 14 March 1890, Pope Leo XIII officially canonized Lidwina. She is the patron saint of ice skaters and the chronically ill, as well as of the town of Schiedam. Her feast day occurs on 18 March, 14 April, or 14 June, depending on region and tradition. In 1859 the Church of Our Lady of Visitation (Onze Lieve Vrouw Visitatie) was opened on the Nieuwe Haven in Schiedam, commonly called Frankelandsekerk after the area it was located in (West-Frankeland). In 1931 this church was officially dedicated to St. Lidwina and called Church of Lidwina (Lidwinakerk). The church was demolished in 1969, and the veneration of Lidwina was moved to the Singelkerk, hence known as the Church of St. Lidwina and Our Lady of the Rosary. This church was elevated to become a minor basilica on 18 June 1990 by Pope John Paul II. The church is now commonly known as the Basilica of Lidwina. After the closure of the Church of Lidwina in 1969, the statue of the saint and her relics were removed to the chapel dedicated to her in the rest-home West- Frankeland on the Sint Liduinastraat in town. Only after the demolition of the chapel in 1987 were all devotional objects removed to the Singelkerk, i.e. the Basilica of Lidwina. Lidwina's name is attached to numerous institutions in Schiedam. Since 2002, the Foundation Intorno Ensemble produces a bi-annual musical theatrical performance about the town saint in one of the Schiedam churches. Outside Schiedam, there is a modern (1960s) church in the Dutch town of Best carrying her name (Lidwina Parochie Best). =Iconography= Lidwina is represented receiving a branch of roses and a flowering rod from an angel.‚ÄúSaint Lidwina‚Äù. New Catholic Dictionary. CatholicSaints.Info  Lidwina and multiple sclerosis  Historical texts reveal that she was afflicted with a debilitating disease, sharing many characteristics with multiple sclerosis, such as the age of onset, duration, and course of disease. Lidwina‚Äôs disease began soon after her fall. From that time onward, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent pains in her teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralyzed and her vision was disturbed. Over the next 34 years, Lidwina's condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission, until her death at the age of 53. Together these factors suggest that a posthumous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis may be plausible, therefore dating the disease back to the 14th century. However, \\"[e]nthusiastic, exaggerated reports and myth building by those who revered her saintliness make interpretation of her condition difficult for the historian.\\"Murray, T. Jock.

In 2006, Ashworth was given the number 1 jacket following the retirement of Sean Wilson and some of his best meetings came when he took on the captaincy following Andre Compton's absence. He retained the number 1 slot for the 2007 season. He took part in the Premier League Fours event in Peterborough, but fell on his first race while attempting to overtake. On 27 November 2008, it was announced that Ricky would once again ride for the Sheffield Tigers and also take over from Andre Compton as the Tigers Captain. On 27 September 2009, on his home track, Ricky rode brilliantly to win the PL Riders Championship. He had top scored during the heats to gain automatic qualification to the Grand Final Heat where he was up against the riders Ty Proctor, Darcy Ward and David Howe. With an awesome start from inside gate-1 he rode from the front to win his first honours in this event at the first time of trying. In 2010, Ricky doubled-up for Belle Vue Aces, along with retaining the captaincy for Sheffield Tigers. On 14 October 2010, Ricky broke his existing Sheffield track record of 59.2 secs (54.56 mph) set on 21 May 2009 with a new time of 59.1 secs at a speed of 54.65 mph). This continues to maintain Sheffield's accolade as being the fastest track in the UK. After being omitted from the Tigers team for 2012, Ashworth signed for Plymouth Devils,\\"Devils bag big name Tiger for 2012 season \\", Plymouth Herald, 16 December 2011, retrieved 2011-12-16 but at the end of January 2012 announced that he would not be joining Plymouth for personal reasons.\\"Ashworth Quits Devils\\", speedway365.co.uk, 31 January 2012, retrieved 2012-02-02 The next day it was announced that he had signed for Berwick Bandits, replacing the injured Kozza Smith.\\"Bandits Bring in No. 1\\", speedway365.co.uk, 1 February 2012, retrieved 2012-02-02 In June 2012 he was added to Elite League Birmingham Brummies team in a doubling-up role.\\"Ashworth Joins Birmingham\\", speedway365.com, 17 June 2012, retrieved 2012-06-17 After suffering serious concussion earlier in the season, a crash at Scunthorpe in August 2013 left him in a coma for 91 days.\\"Ashworth Out of Coma\\", speedwaygb.co, 3 November 2013.

The company was a Mobile Virtual Network Operator offering 3G voice and data services over the Verizon Wireless EV-DO network, including text and picture messaging, push-to-talk, and over- the-air downloadable applications and content (including Video on Demand) from its Amp'd Live service. Its primary non-venture capital investors were MTV Networks and Universal Music Group. The service targeted 18- to 35-year-olds, and was the first integrated mobile entertainment company for youth, young professionals and early adopters, similar to Helio.  Services  =Amp'd Live= Amp'd mobile's service was built around Amp'd Live, a permanently installed BREW application on all Amp'd CDMA phones, which featured downloadable and streaming video on-demand clips, live events such as Supercross, streaming phonecast radio stations, downloadable content such as games, ringtones, and songs. Amp'd Live TV channels, far superior and advanced in image quality than its competitors , included Comedy Central Mobile, MTV Mobile, Spike TV, Oxygen Mobile, MTVU, VH1, LOGO, UFC TV, Fox News, Fox Sports, Playboy Mobile, Discovery Mobile, History Channel, A&E;, Biography Channel, Style, Break TV, E!, WE Mobile, Speed, NBA TV, Girls Gone Wild TV, and Adult Swim Mobile.SU. The TV show Lil Bush aired on Amp'd Live TV before being picked up by Comedy Central. Amp'd Mobile Canada On March 14, 2007, Amp'd Mobile Canada was launched. It was based on a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) partnership with Telus Mobility. Amp'd managed the marketing and multimedia content, while Telus Mobility handled the billing, customer care, retail aspects, and network. On August 1, 2007, after noticing Amp'd Mobile's financial problems in the USA, Telus Mobility announced that it would be discontinuing Amp'd service in Canada. Multimedia content was quickly pulled down, but users could still obtain a similar service from Telus Mobility or other providers. A transition period ensured uninterrupted voice and messaging services. During this time, customers were contacted via phone and were instructed to transition to the Telus Mobility network or that of another provider. Because the Amp'd Mobile phones were CDMA devices, it is very difficult to activate them on a cellular network today. Amp'd Mobile claimed that customers \\"will need to replace\\" their phones and service via Telus Mobility at no extra charge with a $300 credit. However, it is still possible to activate an Amp'd Mobile Phone with a CDMA carrier. On March 17, 2008, nearly a year after Amp'd Mobile Canada's debut, Koodo Mobile was launched by Telus Mobility as their discount MVNO. More importantly, it targeted the youth demographic previously sought by Amp'd. Unlike Amp'd, Koodo does not provide multimedia content. Koodo does, however, offer customizable budget plans for unlimited SMS, MMS, social networking and up to 10 GB of Internet data.  Company and subscriber numbers  = 2006 = At the end of 2006, Amp'd Mobile had over 100,000 subscribers. 89 percent of its customer base is on postpaid contracts, and its total average revenue per user is ‚Äúwell over‚Äù $100 per month. = 2007 = Amp'd Mobile filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 1, 2007. Its subscriber base at the end of the first quarter was about 175,000 customers. On July 20, Amp'd announced its intentions to sell off all its assets at auction. In addition, Best Buy discontinued carrying the Amp'd post-paid service. On July 21, 2007 text messages began to be sent to Amp'd Mobile customer phones that stated: > Your svc may be disconnected on 7.24 @ 12:01 am. Go to www.ampd.com or > contact the location where you activated your service for further > information. On July 24, 2007, Amp'd website updated its FAQ with potential service disconnection pushed back to July 31, 2007. On July 31, 2007 Amp'd sent a text message: > Ampd svc ends @midnight 8/1.

For info go to http://www.prexarmobile.com Prexar Mobile is now itself out of business, the website is no longer up and running. Prexar Mobile was owned by USA (United Systems Access) Telecom.  Bankruptcy  On June 1, 2007, Amp'd filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to court documents, around 80,000 of its 175,000 subscribers were recorded as nonpaying customers. Bankruptcy protection was brought on by Verizon Wireless who threatened to cut off service to Amp'd if debt owed to Verizon wasn't paid. Amp'd Mobile together with its main creditor Kings Road Investment Ltd. sued Verizon Wireless, seeking a court order that barred Verizon from cutting off service to Amp'd Mobile from its network. On June 22, 2007, an agreement was reached between Verizon, Amp'd and Kings Road to pay Verizon off with cash collateral and allow Amp'd the use of Verizon's network. The settlement was heard in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on June 25, 2007. Amp'd indicated an intent to sell off its assets.http://www.streetinsider.com/Basic+Content/Amp'd+Mobile+Puts+Assets+Up+For+Sale+In+Bankruptcy+Court/2709286.html Amp'd Mobile to shut down July 24 at 12:01am? - Engadget Service shutdown Amp'd sent out a text message to all of its users on July 22, 2007 stating that as of July 24, 12:01 a.m. they would be discontinuing all services. This date was later extended to July 31, 2007.? On the evening of July 23, the Amp'd website indicated that customer service would no longer be available. The fate of mobile phone numbers for existing customers who have not yet ported to another carrier was still unknown. On July 26, 2007 Amp'd sent a text message which gave additional information on how bankruptcy will affect its subscribers agreement. The text read as follows: > AMPD MSG: > Additional info about how the Ampd bankruptcy will affect your subscriber > agreement is available at > https://web.archive.org/web/20080705163011/http://chapter11.epiqsystems.com/AMI On July 31, 2007 Amp'd sent another text message: > Ampd svc ends @midnight 8/1.

The mascot was actually created as a joke, which was later approved by Amp'd Mobile. Amp'd Mobile also sponsored an up-and-coming talented beatboxer known as \\"nemesis\\" he had downloadable content on the Amp'd Live network where he gave beatboxing lessons and conducted on camera celebrity interviews and red carpet events, he hosted many events for Amp'd Mobile and was sponsored from 2005 through 2007. Amp'd Mobile was also a prominent advertiser at Ultimate Fighting Championship events. Amp'd Mobile was the title sponsor for the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) Supercross series for 2006 and 2007. Monster Energy became the title sponsor for the 2008 season. Amp'd was also a personal sponsor of Chad Reed and other professional Motocross riders. It was also one of the sponsors of the PBR's Built Ford Tough Series during the 2007 season; it was also the first year that the BFTS hosted an event in New York City's Madison Square Garden, and for 2007 only the event was named the Amp'd Mobile Invitational.  Criticism  = Customer service = A major complaint about Amp'd Mobile was its lack of customer service. Problems activating the service and plans not matching those advertised on the company's web site had been reported. Actually getting in contact with customer service seemed to be a large issue. Many customers claimed to have found themselves on hold via phone support for hours, only to be hung up on. Also, instances of mail-in rebates being \\"lost\\" or never fulfilled had been reported. Amp'd customer service was contracted to ClientLogic at launch. Support was later handled by Sento Corporation, but some time after the bankruptcy filing this support had ended, which had forced Sento to lay off around 200 people in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Orem, Utah.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in northern Victoria, Australia. The town is located within the Shire of Moira local government area on the banks of Broken Creek and on the Murray Valley Highway. At the 2011 census, Nathalia had a population of 1,902. History Prior to European settlement, the area around Nathalia was occupied by the Yorta Yorta people. In 1838, Charles Sturt was the first European to explore the area, following the Murray River downstream. The squatter, W.J Locke established Kotupna station on the future site of Nathalia in 1843. The station was broken up for closer settlement in 1869. A selector, Richard Blake took up the townsite in 1875 and established a sawmill and flour mill soon after. Hotels, a post office (opened on 7 September 1878), schools and churches followed and Nathalia was officially gazetted as a village in 1880. The railway arrived in 1888, allowing local production to increase and a butter factory was established in 1895. The Nathalia Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.

The California EMS Authority is one of the thirteen departments within the California Health and Human Services Agency. The director is required to be a physician with substantial experience in emergency medicine. Dave Duncan MD is the current Director. The mission of the California EMS Authority is to ensure quality patient care by administering an effective, statewide system of coordinated emergency medical care, injury prevention, and disaster medical response. In California, the EMS Authority is responsible for paramedic licensure, emergency medical technician regulations, trauma center and trauma system standards, ambulance service coordination, and disaster medical response. The EMS Authority operates the EMS Central Registry, a public access database that provides information about licensing and certification status of EMTs and paramedics. The EMS Authority manages the state's medical response to major disasters. This includes maintenance, staffing and deployment of three 200-bed mobile field hospitals, 39 Disaster Medical Support Units that supply ambulance strike teams, and three 40-person medical assistance teams that are prepared to respond to a disaster. Disaster Healthcare Volunteers is California‚Äôs initiative to pre- register, verify licensure and credentials, and mobilize professional healthcare volunteers. The program has roughly 14,000 registrants representing 47 professional license types including doctors, dentists, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, technicians, etc.  History and background  Paramedic programs were established as a county option in California in 1971 by the Wedworth- Townsend Pilot Paramedic Act (SB 772)(needs citation). Los Angeles County became the first county in California with paramedics. The popular television show Emergency! demonstrated the potential for improved pre-hospital care. Paramedic programs began to be established in many counties in California. Before 1980, the responsibility for emergency medical services (EMS) and disaster medical preparedness was spread among a variety of state departments. It became clear that a more unified approach to emergency and disaster medical services was needed. The Emergency Medical Services System and Prehospital Emergency Medical Care Personnel Act (California Health and Safety Code sections 1797 et seq.) created the Emergency Medical Services Authority in 1980. This legislation (SB 125) was the culmination of several years of effort by local administrators, health care providers, consumer groups, and legislators to establish a state lead agency and centralized resource to deal with emergency and disaster medical services. Previous Directors of the California Emergency Medical Services Authority were: Roger Taylor MD (1981-1982), George Moorhead (Acting, 1982-1983), Kenneth Kizer MD (1983-1984), George Moorhead (Acting, 1984-1986), Bruce Haynes MD (1986-1989), Daniel Smiley (Acting, 1989-1993), Joseph Morales MD (1993-1997), Richard Watson (Acting, 1997-2005), Cesar Aristeiguieta MD (2005-2007), Daniel Smiley (Acting 2007-2008), R. Steven Tharratt MD (2008-2010), Daniel Smiley (Acting 2010-2011), Howard Backer MD (2011-2019), Julie Souliere (Acting 2019), Dave Duncan MD (2019-Present). Daniel Smiley served as the Chief Deputy Director, and periodic acting Director, for 31 years from 1989 until 2019.  Role  The EMS Authority is charged with providing leadership in developing and implementing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems throughout California. In California, day-to-day EMS system management is a local responsibility. Each county developing an EMS system must designate a local EMS agency (LEMSA) which can be the county health department, an agency established and operated by the county, an entity with which the county contracts for the purposes of EMS administration or a joint powers agency. There are 32 single-county or multi-county local EMS agencies. It is principally through these agencies that the EMS Authority works to promote quality EMS services statewide.

After attending the courses of the Romanian primary and secondary schools in Macedonia at Bitola, he attended the University of Bucharest. In 1893, at age 25, Murnu was appointed professor at the University of Ia≈üi and shortly afterwards was awarded a scholarship by the Romanian State in order to complete his postgraduate studies in Munich, and, after several years he returned to Romania after completing a doctorate in philology. A fruitful scholarly activity followed, culminating in Murnu becoming a chairman professor of archaeology at the University of Bucharest. In 1909, he was appointed head of the National Archaeological Museum in Bucharest by the Ministry of Public Instruction and Religious Confessions. He has translated an accomplished version of the Odyssey and Iliad into Romanian. He also wrote his own works of poetry (with bucolic themes), both in Romanian and in his native Aromanian language. Murnu was a sympathizer of the far right Iron Guard, and was an intimate friend of the Aromanian secessionist politician, Alcibiades Diamandi who in 1917 participated in a failed effort to form an independent Principality of Pindus under the protection of Italy. After the end of World War II, Murnu was not subject to legal investigation - probably due to his age and prestige. He was elected a full member of the Romanian Academy. Nowadays, a street in the Romanian Black Sea port of Mangalia bears his name.

In particular, those ordained in the time of Queen Mary I are often called \\"Marian Priests\\". These latter priests and others ordained at a still earlier period were not \\"seminary priests\\" in any sense because in the Roman Catholic Church of their day the system of training priests in seminaries had not yet been introduced.

Fauna and flora The climate of the Chellian epoch was warm and humid as evidenced by the wild growth of fig trees and laurels.

ESPN Cricinfo more than any other England wicket-keeper in the first sixty years of Test cricket. A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1897, he was described as \\"far and away the greatest cricketer Warwickshire has yet produced.\\" Lilley made his debut for Warwickshire CCC in 1888, before they were a first-class county, and played for them continuously until 1911, making his test debut against Australia at Lord's in 1896. Lilley last played for Warwickshire in July 1911, retiring in \\"early August\\" and the county went on to win the championship that year. His place was taken by Tiger Smith who played for Warwickshire until 1930. After his retirement, Lilley settled in Bristol and was a member of the special advisory committee which helped to re- establish Gloucestershire CCC after the Great War. The conservative cricket establishment of the time was not effusive in its appreciation of this great keeper mainly because he broke with the tradition of standing up to the faster bowlers as was practised by all the great keepers till then\\"As a wicket-keeper Lilley has no superior at the present day against slow and medium pace bowling, but as it is his invariable custom to stand back to all bowling of great speed, he cannot be placed on quite the same level as Blackham, Mr. McGregor, or the late Richard Pilling.\\". He did so on the advice of W. G. Grace who, on seeing him standing up to Tom Richardson, the legendary England fast bowler, suggested that he would \\"do better by standing back\\", which Lilley did for the rest of his career. He was renowned for his cricketing knowledge, and advised \\"a long succession of England captains\\"\\"He was a most admirable and level-headed judge of the game, and his advice on critical occasions was almost invariably sought by a long succession of England captains.\\". However, he once started to set the field without consulting his county skipper, Frank Foster, 23 years his junior, who told him there and then to mind his own business.

Biography Diana and Endymion, 1705-1710 The Royal Hunt of Dido and Aeneas, c. 1712 Francesco Solimena was born in Canale di Serino, province Avellino. He received early training from his father, Angelo Solimena, with whom he executed a Paradise for the cathedral of Nocera (a place where he spent a big part of his life) and a Vision of St. Cyril of Alexandria for the church of San Domenico at Solofra. He settled in Naples in 1674, there he worked in the studio of Francesco di Maria.Pavone, Mario Alberto (2003, January 1). \\"Solimena family\\". Grove Art Online. He was patronized early on, and encouraged to become an artist by Cardinal Vincenzo Orsini (later Pope Benedict XIII). By the 1680s, he had independent fresco commissions, and his active studio came to dominate Neapolitan painting from the 1690s through the first four decades of the 18th century. He modeled his art‚Äîfor he was a highly conventional painter‚Äîafter the Roman Baroque masters, Luca Giordano and Giovanni Lanfranco, and Mattia Preti, whose technique of warm brownish shadowing Solimena emulated. Solimena painted many frescoes in Naples, altarpieces, celebrations of weddings and courtly occasions, mythological subjects, characteristically chosen for their theatrical drama, and portraits. His settings are suggested with a few details‚Äîsteps, archways, balustrades, columns‚Äîconcentrating attention on figures and their draperies, caught in pools and shafts of light. Art historians take pleasure in identifying the models he imitated or adapted in his compositions. His numerous preparatory drawings often mix media, combining pen-and-ink, chalk and watercolor washes. A typical example of the elaborately constructed allegorical \\"machines\\" of his early mature style, fully employing his mastery of chiaroscuro, is the Allegory of Rule (1690) from the Stroganoff collection, which has come to the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. Francesco Solimena amassed a fortune and lived in sumptuous style founded on his success. He died at Barra, near Naples, in 1747. As Solimena had intended it, his nephew Orazio became his pupil and successor as a painter.Pavone, Mario Alberto, Precisazioni su Orazio Solimena, in: Prospettiva, 20 (1980), pp. 80‚Äì87.

He captained Hampshire County Cricket Club between 1896 and 1899. Wynyard was also a successful amateur football player. In 1881, he was a member of the Old Carthusians team that won the FA Cup Final, in which he scored the opening goal in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Old Etonians. Early life Wynyard was born 1 April 1861, at Saharanpur, India, son of a magistrate in the Bengal Civil Service, and successively educated in England at Woodcote House School, Windlesham, at Charterhouse School from 1874 to 1877, and St Edward's School, Oxford, leaving in 1879. Military career Wynyard was commissioned a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment, Warwick Militia in 1881, transferring to regular service with the King's Liverpool Regiment in May 1883. With the latter he was stationed in India and saw active service in the Burma Expedition 1885‚Äì87, winning the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the latter year and being twice mentioned in despatches. Promoted captain on 19 March 1890, he transferred again the same year, to the Welch Regiment. He was Adjutant of the Oxford University Volunteers until late 1899, then instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst from 26 December 1899 until August 1902, when he returned to his regiment. He retired in 1903. While in charge of cricket at the College, he arranged an officer cadets' match against W.G. Grace's XI. Two days before the game Grace wrote to say he would be unable to play, but after learning none of the cadets had seen him play, Wynyard cleverly disguised himself with make-up and false beard and played in the match with the visiting team, batting, making several runs and getting purposely hit on the hand to retire 'hurt'. He revealed his identity minus beard and cap at the teams' lunch but no one had seen through the disguise and his realistic imitation of Grace's batting style. After the outbreak of World War I, Wynyard was recalled in September 1914 as Major with the King's Liverpool Regiment, then was attached to the Army Ordnance Corps in May 1915 before transferring to the Middlesex Regiment in November 1916 when he became Commandant at Thornhill Labour Camp, Aldershot. He finally retired in April 1919 when he was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire (military division). Sports =Cricket= Wynyard as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, August 1898 Wynyard played cricket for his schools, notably for the XI at St Edwards's School, Oxford. He would become President of Charterhouse School's Cricket and Football Club from 1913 to 1919. He played while stationed in India, in one match scoring 123 and 106 runs, both not out, in different innings and while on home leave in 1887 he scored 233 for the Incogniti against Phoenix Park in Dublin. Wynyard played in three Test matches for England, one against Australia in 1896 and two against South Africa in 1905‚Äì06. He had to decline a place on the Test tour to Australia because of army duties in 1897‚Äì98. He was invited to captain England on the Test tour to Australia in 1907‚Äì08 but declined for family reasons. He captained M.C.C. in their tour in New Zealand 1906‚Äì07 (no Test matches) and made further tours in West Indies 1904‚Äì05, topping batting with 562 runs at 40.14; M.C.C. in North America 1907; Egypt 1909; South Africa 1909‚Äì10; United States 1920; and Canada in 1923 when, aged sixty-two, he headed the bowling averages with his underarm lobs. He played for Hampshire between 1878 and 1908 (including years they were not first-class in 1886‚Äì94) and captained the county in 1896‚Äì99. His final first-class match was for M.C.C. against Oxford University in 1912 and in all he scored 8,313 first-class runs, average 33.00, with 13 centuries including 268 runs for Hampshire against Yorkshire in 1896. In 1896 he was the second-highest scoring first-class player in national batting averages with 1,038 runs, average 49.42. In 1899 he was fifteenth placed with a greater 1,281 runs at 41.32. Besides the M.C.C., on whose committee he served in 1920‚Äì24, he was member of the Free Foresters, and represented the South African Cricket Association in England in 1908. =Football= Wynyard was in the school association football XI at Charterhouse in 1876, and at St Edward's School, Oxford, also took up rugby union football, playing in that school's XV. In the latter game he was described as \\"a glorious three-quarter, fast and strong, and could turn on a sixpence when in full cry. Had he not gone into the army, he would have reached the top in the rugger world.\\" He was more active playing for the old boys' club Old Carthusians, as centre-forward. C.W. Alcock described him as \\"a heavy forward, charging and dribbling well; always middles splendidly\\" and \\"good forward, plenty of dash; makes himself obnoxious to the opposing backs\\". He centred the Old Carthusians' team at the FA Cup Final at Kennington Oval on 9 April 1881, and, 25 minutes into the match, he scored his team's first goal in a 3‚Äì0 win against the Old Etonians. Earlier in the first half he attempted to score with a header. He twice played for the Corinthians in 1893, scoring five goals. He also appeared in representative matches for London. =Other sports= Wynyard won the European international toboggan championship at Davos, Switzerland in 1894. It was while in the area he rescued a peasant from drowning in a lake on 9 December 1893, earning the award in 1895 of the medal of the Royal Humane Society. He played county hockey for Hampshire and later took up golf, forming his own club, \\"The Jokers\\" which was drawn largely from distinguished cricketers of which he was \\"Chief Joker\\". Other clubs he joined were Beaconsfield, Royal Wimbledon and Oxford Graduates' Golfing Society. Later life Wynyard died at his home, The Red House, at Knotty Green near Beaconsfield on 30 October 1936, aged 75, and was buried in the churchyard at Penn, Buckinghamshire.

The Keuper consists of dolomite, shales or claystones and evaporites that were deposited during the Middle and Late Triassic epochs (about ). The Keuper lies on top of the Muschelkalk and under the predominantly Lower Jurassic Lias or other Early Jurassic strata. The Keuper together with the Muschelkalk and the Buntsandstein form the Germanic Trias Group, a characteristic sequence of rock strata that gave the Triassic its name. \\"Muschelkalk (geology)\\", Britannica Online Encyclopedia, October 2010, webpage: EB-39. . Exposure The Upper Triassic is well exposed in Swabia, Franconia, Alsace and Lorraine and Luxembourg; it extends from Basel on the east side of the Rhine into Hanover, and through England into Scotland and north-east Ireland; it appears flanking the central plateau of France and in the Pyrenees and Sardinia. The Keuper sequence is linked by name to the Keuper Uplands area of southern Germany. In south Sweden, the lower portion contains coal-bearing strata, as in the Himalayas, Japan, Tibet, Burma, eastern Siberia and in Spitsbergen. The upper portion of the Karoo Supergroup of South Africa and part of the Otapiri stage of New Zealand are probably of Rhaetian age. =Germany= In Germany and adjacent parts of western and central Europe, the Keuper unit is divided into three groups: *Upper Keuper :The upper part of this division is often a grey dolomite known as the Grenz dolomite; the impure coal beds Lettenkohle are aggregated towards the base. The upper Keuper, Rhaetic or Avicula contorta zone in Germany is mainly sandy with dark grey shales and marls; it is seldom more than . The sandstones are used for building purposes at Bayreuth, Culmbach and Bamberg. In Swabia and the Wesergebirge are several bone-beds, thicker than those in the middle Keuper, which contain a rich assemblage of fossil remains of fish, reptiles and the mammalian teeth of Microlestes antiquus and Triglyptzas Fraasi. The name \\"Rhaetic\\" is derived from the Rhaetic Alps where the beds are well developed; they occur also in central France, the Pyrenees and England. In South Tirol and the Judicarian Mountains, the Rhaetic is represented by the Kossenei beds. In the Alpine region, the presence of coral beds gives rise to the so-called Lithodendron Kalk. *Hauptkeuper or Gipskeuper, the middle : The middle division is thicker than either of the others (at G√∂ttingen, ); it consists of a marly series below, grey, red and green marls, with gypsum and dolomite‚Äîthis is the gypskeuper in its restricted sense. The higher part of the series is sandy, hence called the Steinmergel; it is comparatively free from gypsum. To this division belong the Myophoria beds (M. Raibliana) with galena in places; the Estheria beds (E. laxilesta); the Schelfsandstein, used as a building-stone; the Lehrherg and Berg-gyps beds; Semionotus beds (S. Bergen) with building-stone of Coburg; and the Burgand Stubensandstein. *Kohlenkeuper, Unterkeuper or Lettenkohle, the lower :The lower division consists mainly of grey clays and schieferletten with white, grey and brightly colored sandstone and dolomitic limestone. The salt, which is associated with gypsum, is exploited in south Germany at Dreuze, Pettoncourt, as well as in Vie in the Lorraine region of France. A 4-metre (13 ft) coal is found on this horizon in the Erzgebirge on the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, and another, 2 metres thick (7 ft), has been mined in Upper Silesia, now in Poland. =Great Britain= In Great Britain the 'Keuper' is no longer a formally recognised geological division. The one-time Keuper Marls are now redesignated as the Mercia Mudstone Group. The underlying Keuper Sandstone is now the Helsby Sandstone Formation at the top of the Sherwood Sandstone Group. Traditionally it contained the following subdivisions: *Rhaetic or Penarth :Grey, red and green marls, black shales, and so-called white (). Upper Keuper marl, red and grey marls and shales with rock salt, . As in Germany, there are one or more bone beds in the English Rhaetic with a similar assemblage of fossils. *Lower Keuper :Sandstone, marls and thin sandstones at the top, red and white sandstones (including the so- called waterstones) below, with breccias and conglomerates at the base, . *Basal conglomerate :A shore or scree breccia derived from local materials; it is well developed in the Mendip district. The rocksalt beds vary from 25 cm (1 inch) to in thickness; they are extensively worked (mined and pumped) in Cheshire, Middlesbrough and Antrim. The Keuper covers a large area in the Midlands and around the flanks of the Pennine range; it reaches southward to the east Devon coast, northeastward into Yorkshire and northwestward into Northern Ireland and southernmost Scotland. Fossils The Keuper is not rich in fossils; the principal plants are cypresslike conifers (Walchia, Voltzia) and a few calamites with such forms as Equisetum arenaceum and Pterophyllum jaegeri. Avicula contorta, Protocardium rhaeticum, Terebratula gregaria, Myophoria costata, M. goldfassi, Lingula tenuessima, and Anoplophoria lettica may be mentioned among the invertebrates. Fishes include Ceratodus, Hybodus and Lepidotus. Labyrinthodonts represented by the footprints of Cheirotherium and the bones of Mastodonsaurus (originally called Labyrinthodon) and Capitosaurus. Among the reptiles are Hyperodapedon, Palaeosaurus, Zanclodon, Nothosaurus, Henodus and Belodon. The first fossil mammals also make their appearance at this time.

He is one of the very few Test cricketers to have made his claims for inclusion purely upon his performance for an Oxbridge university. He had played a few times for Surrey in 1895 and 1897, when the team was a powerful force in county cricket, but his performance was so modest that he had difficulty justifying his place. Life Frank Druce was the son of Walter William Druce of Denmark Hill, London. He began his career in cricket with the Marlborough College eleven between 1891 and 1893, captaining them in his last season before moving to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1893. He achieved little for Cambridge in 1894, but in 1895, with very dry weather and firm pitches whilst University cricket was being played, he scored 786 runs in 17 innings for the university at an average of 56. He made an impressive 50 on a fiery pitch for the Gentlemen against an extremely strong Players attack (with Richardson, Mold and Peel prominent) at Lord's in July, but playing for Surrey in July and August that year Druce was a complete failure on a succession of sticky wickets - so much so that in seven matches he scored only 111 runs from ten innings. In 1896, Druce again did well for Cambridge with the weather even drier than in the corresponding period of 1895. He was not available for Surrey after the University season ended, but in 1897, after being appointed captain of Cambridge University, he surpassed his 1895 form, averaging 66 an innings. Although he was again disappointing for Surrey later that year, his form was so good for the University that Wisden chose Druce as one of their Five Cricketers of the Year for 1898 and he toured Australia. Although England were overwhelmed as bowlers like Richardson and Briggs lost form, Druce did not do badly, averaging 28 in his five Tests. Although it was rumoured that Druce would play for Kent in 1898, it was, according to Wisden that year, thought that \\"very little will be seen of him in first-class cricket\\". In fact, Druce could not spare any time at all for county cricket as he moved into business, and though he played two more first-class matches for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and H.D.G. Leveson Gower's XI in 1902 and 1909, his serious cricket had ended with his Ashes tour. However, his 152 for Free Foresters against Cambridge University as late as 1912 does suggest he would have done a good deal had he been able to play even occasionally. Druce was a rather unorthodox batsman focused chiefly on hitting, and for his day his hitting on the leg-side was exceptional in quality. Although he was not a pure slogger, his defence on sticky wickets was not the equal of the best batsmen of his day, as shown in August 1895.

Course and features The Coxs River rises in Gardiners Gap, within Ben Bullen State Forest, east of Cullen Bullen, and flows through the Megalong Valley and parts of the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site including the Blue Mountains and Kanangra-Boyd national parks, heading generally south and then east, joined by fifteen tributaries including the Little, Jenolan, Kedumba, Kowmung, and Wollondilly rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Warragamba River to form Lake Burragorang. The river descends over its course. The river is impounded at Lake Wallace where it forms a cooling source for Wallerawang Power Station; at Lake Lyell where it is used for water supply for the city of Lithgow and water cooling for Wallerawang Power Station; and at Lake Burragorang, a major water supply source for greater metropolitan Sydney. At Wallerawang, the river is crossed by a stone single-track railway bridge, completed in 1870; and a replacement masonry/brick double-track railway underbridge, completed in 1923. East of Wallerawang, the Great Western Highway (A32) also crosses the river, via the Jack Wilson Bridge. History To the Aboriginal peoples who lived in the area for thousands of years before white settlement, Coxs River was one of two corridors that could be used to cross the Blue Mountains, the other being the Bilpin Ridge, now the site of Bells Line of Road. Coxs River was the easiest way to cross the mountains, but this fact was unknown to the European settlers, for whom the mountains were a seemingly impassable barrier. A former convict, John Wilson, may have been the first European to cross the Blue Mountains. Wilson arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 as a convict and was released in 1792. After this, he lived with the Aborigines and functioned as an intermediary between them and the settlers. In 1797 Wilson returned to Sydney, claiming to have explored up to a hundred miles in all directions around Sydney, including across the mountains. His descriptions and observations were generally accurate, and it is possible that he had crossed the mountains via the Coxs River corridor, guided by the Aborigines. Governor Macquarie named both Coxs River and Coxs Pass in honour of William Cox, a military officer, roadmaker and builder. In 1815 the naming of the Coxs River is mentioned: Pollution As of 2008, there were concerns about water quality in upper Coxs River. Testing carried out by researchers from the Blue Mountains Conservation Society showed that this part of the river had high levels of heavy metals including zinc, copper and manganese, 125 times more sulphate than surrounding streams and only 5% of the oxygen that fish need. The pH level, a test of acidity, was up to 1000 times higher than that of neighbouring creeks, while the river was 80 times as salty as it should be. The Sydney Catchment Authority confirmed that the test was accurate, but said the water gets safer to drink in the lower river, approaching Warragamba Dam. The Department of Environment and Climate Change stated that the contamination could be caused by Delta Electricity's Wallerawang Power Station reusing its water as a result of drought. Delta stated that it was operating within the conditions of its licence. In 2009, Dr Ian Wright of the University of Western Sydney reported that the water flowing into Coxs River contained high levels of copper, boron and other metals at \\"many times\\" the levels found upstream of the Wallerawang Power Station. High arsenic levels were found down stream of the plant, although it was diluted further downstream and was not thought to pose a risk to humans. The Blue Mountains Conservation Society was taking a case to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales with the backing of Environment Defenders Office of New South Wales, intending to argue that Delta Electricity are polluting Coxs River. The Society also intended to challenge the New South Wales system of environmental licences. The Society's president, Tara Cameron, said: \\"These licences are just licences to pollute. They are just allowing the status quo and making people feel good without actually protecting the environment.\\" Journalists Ben Cubby and Erik Jensen maintained that the NSW Government had known about the pollution for over two years. Activities and access A range of leisure activities are accessible adjacent to the river, including the Katoomba to Mittagong Trail, the Six Foot Track and camping. Vehicle access is available at many locations along the river. There are several areas close to Hartley. As the river progresses towards Lake Burragorang, vehicle access is not permitted. Bushwalking is the most popular access method to the Coxs River. There are several well maintained historic walks that follow along scenic sections of the river. One of the most popular is the Six Foot Track. Horse riding is another popular way to enjoy the Coxs river. There are several tour operators in the Megalong Valley that offer day and overnight rides.

The Flower family retained ownership of the estate until 1922, when they were forced to sell up and return to England. It was bought by a Mr. Maher of Freshford, County Kilkenny who was primarily interested in the estate's timber reserves. Eventually the Land Commission took over the arable portion of the property and the Forestry Department took over the woodland. After standing empty for some years the house itself was transformed in 1929 into a school (St Fintan's College and Convent) and in 1998 was purchased by Peter and Shelley Stokes and redeveloped as the luxury Castle Durrow Country House Hotel.Ireland's Blue Book, www.irelands-blue- book.ie, January 9, 2006, retrieved January 9, 2006.

It is an electron gas that is free to move in two dimensions, but tightly confined in the third. This tight confinement leads to quantized energy levels for motion in the third direction, which can then be ignored for most problems. Thus the electrons appear to be a 2D sheet embedded in a 3D world. The analogous construct of holes is called a two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG), and such systems have many useful and interesting properties. Realizations In MOSFETs, the 2DEG is only present when the transistor is in inversion mode, and is found directly beneath the gate oxide. Band edge diagram of a basic HEMT. Conduction band edge and Fermi level determine the electron density in the 2DEG. Quantized levels form in the triangular well (yellow region) and optimally only one of them lies below . Heterostructure corresponding to the band edge diagram above. Most 2DEGs are found in transistor-like structures made from semiconductors. The most commonly encountered 2DEG is the layer of electrons found in MOSFETs (metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistors). When the transistor is in inversion mode, the electrons underneath the gate oxide are confined to the semiconductor-oxide interface, and thus occupy well defined energy levels. For thin-enough potential wells and temperatures not too high, only the lowest level is occupied (see the figure caption), and so the motion of the electrons perpendicular to the interface can be ignored. However, the electron is free to move parallel to the interface, and so is quasi-two-dimensional. Other methods for engineering 2DEGs are high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMTs) and rectangular quantum wells. HEMTs are field-effect transistors that utilize the heterojunction between two semiconducting materials to confine electrons to a triangular quantum well. Electrons confined to the heterojunction of HEMTs exhibit higher mobilities than those in MOSFETs, since the former device utilizes an intentionally undoped channel thereby mitigating the deleterious effect of ionized impurity scattering. Two closely spaced heterojunction interfaces may be used to confine electrons to a rectangular quantum well. Careful choice of the materials and alloy compositions allow control of the carrier densities within the 2DEG. Electrons may also be confined to the surface of a material. For example, free electrons will float on the surface of liquid helium, and are free to move along the surface, but stick to the helium; some of the earliest work in 2DEGs was done using this system. Besides liquid helium, there are also solid insulators (such as topological insulators) that support conductive surface electronic states. Recently, atomically thin solid materials have been developed (graphene, as well as metal dichalcogenide such as molybdenum disulfide) where the electrons are confined to an extreme degree. The two-dimensional electron system in graphene can be tuned to either a 2DEG or 2DHG (2-D hole gas) by gating or chemical doping. This has been a topic of current research due to the versatile (some existing but mostly envisaged) applications of graphene. A separate class of heterostructures that can host 2DEGs are oxides. Although both sides of the heterostructure are insulators, the 2DEG at the interface may arise even without doping (which is the usual approach in semiconductors). Typical example is a ZnO/ZnMgO heterostructure. More examples can be found in a recent review including a notable discovery of 2004, a 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface which becomes superconducting at low temperatures. The origin of this 2DEG is still unknown, but it may be similar to modulation doping in semiconductors, with electric-field-induced oxygen vacancies acting as the dopants. Experiments Considerable research involving 2DEGs and 2DHGs has been done, and much continues to this day. 2DEGs offer a mature system of extremely high mobility electrons, especially at low temperatures. When cooled to 4 K, 2DEGs may have mobilities \\\\mu of the order of 1,000,000 cm2/Vs and lower temperatures can lead to further increase of \\\\mu still. Specially grown, state of the art heterostructures with mobilities around 30,000,000 cm2/(V¬∑s) have been made. These enormous mobilities offer a test bed for exploring fundamental physics, since besides confinement and effective mass, the electrons do not interact with the semiconductor very often, sometimes traveling several micrometers before colliding; this so-called mean free path \\\\ell can be estimated in the parabolic band approximation as : \\\\ell = v_{\\\\rm F}\\\\tau = \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi n} \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\mu}{e} \\\\approx 5.2\\\\ \\\\mu\\\\mathrm{m}\\\\times \\\\mu\\\\ [10^6\\\\ \\\\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}]\\\\sqrt{n\\\\ [10^{11}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}]} where n is the electron density in the 2DEG. Note that \\\\mu typically depends on n. Mobilities of 2DHG systems are smaller than those of most 2DEG systems, in part due to larger effective masses of holes (few 1000 cm2/(V¬∑s) can already be considered high mobility). Aside from being in practically every semiconductor device in use today, two dimensional systems allow access to interesting physics. The quantum Hall effect was first observed in a 2DEG, which led to two Nobel Prizes in physics, of Klaus von Klitzing in 1985, and of Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. St√∂rmer and Daniel C. Tsui in 1998. Spectrum of a laterally modulated 2DEG (a two-dimensional superlattice) subject to magnetic field B can be represented as the Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure in the energy vs B plot, signatures of which were observed in transport experiments. Many more interesting phenomena pertaining to 2DEG have been studied.[A] Footnotes *A. Examples of more 2DEG physics. Full control of the 2DEG spin polarization was recently demonstrated.

Modern Pagaruyung is a village in Tanjung Emas subdistrict, Tanah Datar regency, located near the town of Batusangkar, Indonesia. History =Beginnings= Adityawarman is believed to have founded the kingdom and presided over the central Sumatra region between 1347 and 1375, most likely to control the local gold trade. The few artefacts recovered from Adityawarman's reign include a number of stones containing inscriptions, and statues. Some of these items were found at Bukit Gombak, a hill near modern Pagarruyung, and it is believed a royal palace was located there. Replica of the Pagaruyung palace in West Sumatra. There is a major gap in the historical picture in the Minangkabau highlands between the last date of Adityawarman's inscription in 1375 and Tom√© Pires Suma Oriental, written some time between 1513 and 1515. By the 16th century, the time of the next report after the reign of Adityawarman, royal power had been split into three recognised reigning kings. They were the King of the World (Raja Alam), the King of Adat (Raja Adat), and the King of Religion (Raja Ibadat). Collectively they were called the Kings of the Three Seats (Rajo Tigo Selo). The first European to enter the region was Thomas Dias, a Portuguese employed by the Dutch governor of Malacca. He travelled from the east coast to reach the region in 1684 and reported, probably from hearsay, that there was a palace at Pagaruyung and that visitors had to go through three gates to enter it. The primary local occupations at the time were gold panning and agriculture, he reported. =Padri War= A civil war started in 1803 with the Padri fundamentalist Islamic group in conflict with the traditional syncretic groups, elite families and Pagarruyung royals. The original Pagaruyung Palace on Batu Patah Hill was burned down during a riot in Padri War back in 1804. During the conflict most of the Minangkabau royal family were killed in 1815, on the orders of Tuanku Lintau. The British controlled the west coast of Sumatra between 1795 and 1819. Stamford Raffles visited Pagarruyung in 1818, reaching it from the west coast, and by then it had been burned to the ground three times. It was rebuilt after the first two fires, but abandoned after the third, and Raffles found little more than waringin trees. The Dutch returned to Padang in May 1819. As a result of a treaty with a number of penghulu and representatives of the murdered Minangkabau royal family, Dutch forces made their first attack on a Padri village in April 1821. The prestige of Pagaruyung remained high among the Minangkabau communities in the rantau, and when the members of the court were scattered following a failed rebellion against the Dutch in 1833, one of the princes was invited to become ruler in Kuantan.Anon, (1893), Mededelingen...Kwantan. TBG 36: 325‚Äì42. Influence The influence of the kingdom of Pagaruyung covered almost the entire island of Sumatra as written by William Marsden in his book The history of Sumatra (1784). Several other kingdoms outside Sumatra also recognized Pagaruyung's sovereignty, although not in a tribute-giving relationship. There are as many as 62 to 75 small kingdoms in the archipelago which are the main ones in Pagaruyung, which are spread in the Philippines, Brunei, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as in Sumatra, East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia. The relationship is distinguished based on gradasi (gradations) of the relationship, namely sapiah balahan (female bloodline), kaduang karatan (male bloodline), Kapak radai, and timbang pacahan who are royal descendants.

Some languages do not call the relevant concept \\"exception handling\\"; others may not have direct facilities for it, but can still provide means to implement it.

Instead, a ///. interface is provided by functions. import Prelude hiding(catch) import Control.Exception instance Exception Int instance Exception Double main = do catch (catch (throw (42::Int)) (\\\\e-> print (0,e::Double))) (\\\\e-> print (1,e::Int)) prints (1,42) in analogy with this C++ #include using namespace std; int main() { try {throw (int)42;} catch(double e) {cout << \\"(0,\\" << e << \\")\\" << endl;} catch(int e) {cout << \\"(1,\\" << e << \\")\\" << endl;} } Another example is do { \\\\-- Statements in which errors might be thrown } \`catch\` \\\\ex -> do { \\\\-- Statements that execute in the event of an exception, with 'ex' bound to the exception } In purely functional code, if only one error condition exists, the type may be sufficient, and is an instance of Haskell's class by default. More complex error propagation can be achieved using the or monads, for which similar functionality (using ) is supported. = Java = A \`try\` block must have at least one \`catch\` or \`finally\` clause and at most one \`finally\` clause. try { // Normal execution path. throw new EmptyStackException(); } catch (ExampleException ee) { // Deal with the ExampleException. } finally { // Always run when leaving the try block (including finally clauses), regardless of whether any exceptions were thrown or whether they were handled. // Often used to clean up and close resources such a file handles. // May no be run when System.exit() is called and in other system-wide exceptional conditions (e.g. power loss). } = JavaScript = The design of JavaScript makes loud/hard errors very uncommon. Soft/quiet errors are much more prevalent. Hard errors propagate to the nearest \`try\` statement, which must be followed by either a single \`catch\` clause, a single \`finally\` clause, or both. try { // Statements in which exceptions might be thrown throw new Error(\\"error\\"); } catch(error) { // Statements that execute in the event of an exception } finally { // Statements that execute afterward either way } If there is no \`try\` statement at all, then the webpage does not crash. Rather, an error is logged to the console and the stack is cleared. However, JavaScript has the interesting quirk of asynchronous externally-invoked entry points. Whereas, in most other languages, there is always some part of the code running at all times, JavaScript does not have to run linearly from start to end. For example, event listeners, Promises, and timers can be invoked by the browser at a later point in time and run in an isolated but shared context with the rest of the code. Observe how the code below will throw a new error every 4 seconds for an indefinite period of time or until the browser/tab/computer is closed. setInterval(function() { throw new Error(\\"Example of an error thrown on a 4 second interval.\\"); }, 4000); Another interesting quirk is polymorphism: JavaScript can throw primitive values as errors. try { throw 12345; // primitive number } catch(error) { console.log(error); // logs 12345 as a primitive number to the console } Note that the \`catch\` clause is a catch-all, which catches every type of error. There is no syntaxical ability to assign different handlers to different error types aside from experimental and presently removed Gecko extensions from many years ago. Instead, one can either propagate the error by using a \`throw\` statement inside the \`catch\` statement, or use multiple conditional cases. Let us compare an example in Java and its rough equivalents in JavaScript. // Example in Java try { Integer i = null; i.intValue(); // throws a NullPointerException } catch(NullPointerException error) { // Variable might be null } catch(ArithmeticException error) { // Handle problems with numbers } // Approximation #1 in JavaScript try { // Statements in which exceptions might be thrown var example = null; example.toString(); } catch(error) { if (error.type = \\"TypeError\\") { // Variable might be null } else if (error.type = \\"RangeError\\") { // Handle problems with numbers } } // Approximation #2 in JavaScript try { try { // Statements in which exceptions might be thrown var example = null; example.toString(); } catch(error) { if (error.type ! \\"TypeError\\") throw error; // Variable might be null } } catch(error) { if (error.type ! \\"RangeError\\") throw error; // Handle problems with numbers } Another aspect of exceptions are promises, which handle the exception asynchronously. Handling the exception asynchronously has the benefit that errors inside the error handler do not propagate further outwards. new Promise(function() { throw new Error(\\"Example error!\\"); }).catch(function(err) { console.log(\\"Caught \\", err); }); Also observe how event handlers can tie into promises as well. addEventListener(\\"unhandledrejection\\", function(event) { console.log(event.reason); event.preventDefault(); //prevent logging the error via console.error to the console--the default behavior }); new Promise(function() { throw new Error(\\"Example error!\\"); }); Lastly, note that, as JavaScript uses mark-and-sweep garbage-collection, there is never any memory leakage from throw statements because the browser automatically cleans dead objects--even with circular references. try { // Statements in which exceptions might be thrown const obj = {}; obj.selfPropExample = obj; // circular reference throw obj; } catch(error) { // Statements that execute in the event of an exception } = Lisp =  Common Lisp  (ignore- errors (/ 1 0)) (handler-case (progn (print \\"enter an expression\\") (eval (read))) (error (e) (print e))) (unwind-protect (progn (print \\"enter an expression\\") (eval (read))) (print \\"This print will always be executed, similar to finally.\\")) = Lua = Lua uses the \`pcall\` and \`xpcall\` functions, with \`xpcall\` taking a function to act as a \`catch\` block. ; Predefined function function foo(x) if x then return x else error \\"Not a true value\\" end end function attempt(arg) success, value = pcall(foo, arg) if not success then print(\\"Error: \\" .. tostring(value)) else print(\\"Returned: \\" .. tostring(value)) end end attempt(\\"hello\\") \\\\-- Returned: hello attempt(nil) \\\\-- Error: stdin:5: Not a true value attempt({}) \\\\-- Returned: table: 00809308 if foo(42) then print \\"Success\\" end \\\\-- Success ; Anonymous function if pcall( function() \\\\-- Do something that might throw an error. end) then print \\"No errors\\" -- Executed if the protected call was successful. else print \\"Error encountered\\" -- Executed if the protected call failed. end print \\"Done\\" -- Will always be executed = Next Generation Shell = ; Defining custom exception type type MyError(Error) ; Raising exceptions throw MyError(\\"this happened\\") ; Exception handling and propagation try { # something } catch(e:MyError) { guard e.val = 7 # ... } catch(e:MyError) { # ... } catch(e:Error) { # ... } ; Ignoring exceptions - try without catch try 1/0 # evaluates to null ; Ignoring exceptions - \\"tor\\" operator \\"tor\\" is try-or operator.

After the , the special variable contains the value passed from . However, scoping issues can make doing this correctly quite ugly: my ($error, $failed); { local $@; $failed = not eval { # Code that could throw an exception (using 'die') open(FILE, $file)  die \\"Could not open file: $!\\"; while () { process_line($_); } close(FILE)  die \\"Could not close $file: $!\\"; return 1; }; $error = $@; } if ($failed) { warn \\"got error: $error\\"; } Perl 5.005 added the ability to throw objects as well as strings. This allows better introspection and handling of types of exceptions. eval { open(FILE, $file)  die MyException::File->new($!); while () { process_line($_); } close(FILE)  die MyException::File->new($!); }; if ($@) { # The exception object is in $@ if ($@->isa('MyException::File')) { # Handle file exception } else { # Generic exception handling # or re-throw with 'die $@' } } The pseudo-signal can be trapped to handle calls to . This is not suitable for exception handling since it is global. However it can be used to convert string-based exceptions from third-party packages into objects. local $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { my $err = shift; if ($err->isa('MyException')) { die $err; # re-throw } else { # Otherwise construct a MyException with $err as a string die MyException::Default->new($err); } }; The forms shown above can sometimes fail if the global variable is changed between when the exception is thrown and when it is checked in the statement. This can happen in multi- threaded environments, or even in single-threaded environments when other code (typically called in the destruction of some object) resets the global variable before the checking code. The following example shows a way to avoid this problem (see or ; cf. ). But at the cost of not being able to use return values: eval { # Code that could throw an exception (using 'die') but does NOT use the return statement; 1; } or do { # Handle exception here. The exception string is in $@ }; Several modules in the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) expand on the basic mechanism: * provides a set of exception classes and allows use of the try/throw/catch/finally syntax. * and both allow use of try/catch/finally syntax instead of boilerplate to handle exceptions correctly. * is a base class and class-maker for derived exception classes.

He started school in Sinaia, but attended the village school in P√¢rscov, in the Nehoiu Valley from 1955 to 1957, and often returned to the mountains during school holidays. Ple»ôu attended the Spiru Haret Lyceum in Bucharest majoring in humanities, where he graduated at the top of his class. Ple»ôu studied art history at the University of Bucharest and graduated with his bachelor's in 1971. That year, he accepted a post as a researcher at the Institute of Art History of the Romanian Academy. In 1972 he married Catrinel Maria Petrulian. While a student, he became a member of the Communist Party, from which he was expelled in May 1982 due to his involvement in the so-called \\"Transcendental Meditation Affair\\". For 1975‚Äì1977 he received the first of his Alexander von Humboldt Foundation graduate scholarships to study in Bonn and Heidelberg. From 1978 through 1982, along with Gabriel Liiceanu, he attended Constantin Noica's informal and semi-clandestine lectures in PƒÉltini»ô. In 1980 he became a faculty lecturer in the Art department at the University of Bucharest.Neamtu, ‚ÄúThe Seasons of Life and the Practice of Wisdom‚Äù p. 30 In Neam»õu, Mihail and TƒÉtaru-Cazaban, Bogdan (eds.)

He received his second Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for 1983‚Äì1984, and upon his return again worked at the Institute of Art History. In April 1989, Ple»ôu lost his job at the Institute of Art History due to his open support of Mircea Dinescu, objected to by the communist regime. This resulted in his \\"exile\\" to Tescani, a village in Bere»ôti-TazlƒÉu commune, BacƒÉu County, and he was forbidden from publishing. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 he was one of the founders of the \\"New Europe College\\" an institute of advanced studies, and of the cultural magazine Dilema (now Dilema Veche). He worked as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bucharest and is now a professor at the University of Bucharest, where he teaches art history and philosophy of religion. He continues to be successful as a writer, and his books have all been well received by critics and readers. He also became involved in politics, serving as Romania's Minister of Culture from 1990 to 1991, and foreign minister from 1997 to 1999. Between 2000 and 2004, Ple»ôu was a member of the National College for the Study of the Securitate Archives; he resigned the latter office in protest against political pressures on the committee. After the 2004 elections brought Traian BƒÉsescu to the office of President of Romania, he became presidential counsellor for external affairs, a position he held until June 2005, when he resigned invoking health issues.

The property is of considerable note because of its relationship with convicts, bushrangers and the Cobb & Co coaching company. The property was offered as an estate to its owner Thomas Icely by the early New South Wales Government in 1826. It was one of the first estates created on the western side of the Blue Mountains that border the area of Sydney. History Thomas Icely enlisted (not of their own free-will) the help of 62 convicts to build the original homestead and outbuildings between 1838 and 1842 and indeed the original shearing shed and stables are still standing from their construction date of 1848. Coombing Park - inside stable built in 1848 The eastern boundary of the property borders the Mt Macquarie road which leads directly to the town Carcoar, which was specifically created in 1839 so as to service the Coombing Park estate and is situated about 1 kilometre away. The town required the presence of about 27 Mounted and Foot Police, specifically with the aim of controlling the frequent appearance of bushrangers in the area. One notorious bushranger directly related with the Coombing Park property was Mickey Bourke who shot and wounded an employee of Coombing Park whilst he was stealing a racehorse from the stables. Thomas Icely's original cottage was replaced by a large single storey but elegant brick villa that was designed and built by G.A. Mansfield in 1900. This was some 20 years after the property had been purchased in 1881 by the Cobb & Co coaching company and occupied by a partner of the Cobb & Co firm, a Mr William Franklin Whitney. Whitney's descendants still own and live on the property. It retains much Cobb & Co memorabilia. Iron ore quarry at Coombing Park, c.1923. Thomas Icely had identified the presence of copper ore close to the homestead, as early as 1847. He had shafts‚Äîreferred to as the Coombing Mine‚Äîsunk to mine the lode from 1848 to 1851. In 1875, this mine was reopened‚Äîby Lewis Lloyd and Saul Samuel‚Äîand, in 1876, a copper smelter was built close to it. A separate location on the property‚Äîabout 2km south-east of the homestead, close to the modern-day Fell Timber Road‚Äîwas, from 1876 to 1878, the site of the Geraldine copper mine. There was a quarry on the property, which provided iron ore from around 1899, for use as flux at the Cockle Creek Smelter. Later and more significantly, it provided ore‚Äîaround 500,000 tons‚Äîfor the Lithgow Blast Furnace, from late April 1907 up to May 1923, when the lease expired and was not renewed. This second ore mining operation included a railway line, 1¬º miles in length, connecting the quarry to the Blayney‚ÄìDemondrille railway line south of Carcoar. The iron ore quarry was located south of Coombing Creek and just west of modern-day Fell Timber Road. The formation of the former railway line remains discernible in aerial views. Holistic management The property is still a working farm. Once on the verge of ruin, with severe land degradation, the farm was turned around using Allan Savory's holistic management farming techniques, where the livestock are grouped together and herded to mimic the migrations in nature of herds of wild herbivores.

Lithology and stratigraphy  Animals by the Purbeck lagoon The rocks predominantly comprise calcareous mudstones though also include clays, shales and marls with marly, tuffaceous and shelly limestones, occasional oolitic and sandy strata, and evaporites. Nodules of chert are present in some of the limestones. The thickness of the formation in Wiltshire is 80 to , but in Dorset it is typically between thick. In the Weald of East Sussex the Purbeck Group has a typical thickness of between . In most places the Purbeck Group rests conformably upon the Portland Group and it is conformably overlaid by the Wealden Group; but there are in some districts distinct indications that the Portland Group was uplifted and worn away to some extent prior to the deposition of the Purbeck Group. = Correlations = In the past, many geologists have ranged the Purbeck Group with the overlying Lower Cretaceous Wealden Group on account of the similarity of its fresh-water faunas; but the marine fossils, including the fishes, ally the Purbeck more closely with the Upper Jurassic rocks of other parts, and it may be regarded as the equivalent of the upper Volgian of Russia. Contemporaneous rocks are also present in the neighbourhood of Boulogne-sur-Mer, where they are characterized by thin limestones with Cyrena and gypsiferous marls. These French outcrops occur, just like those in England, in the core of the Weald-Artois anticline. Purbeckian aged deposits occur even further south in the Charente. In north- west Germany three subdivisions are recognized in strata of the same age: in descending order Purbeck Kalk, Serpulit and M√ºnder Mergel. = Subdivisions =  Modern  The Purbeck Group in Dorset is now divided into three formations, the Lulworth Formation and the overlying Durlston Formation in the south (in the Vectian or Wessex Basin). A third underlying formation, the Haddenham Formation, is identified in Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Within the Vectian Basin, the Durlston Formation is further divided into a lower 'Stair Hole Member' and an upper 'Peveril Point Member'. Similarly the Lulworth Formation is divided in Dorset into a lower 'Mupe Member', a middle 'Ridgeway Member' and an upper 'Worbarrow Tout Member'.Hopson et al. 2009 A stratigraphical framework for the Lower Cretaceous of England, British Geological Survey Research Report, RR/08/03 p55-6 In East Sussex the Purbeck Group is formally subdivided into the Blues and Greys Limestones members  Traditional  The sequence was traditionally divided into three, though along different lines viz. Upper, Middle and Lower. The Upper Purbeck comprises . of fresh-water clays and shales with limestones, the Purbeck marble and Unio-bed, in the lower part. The Middle division (), mainly thin limestones with shaly partings, contains the principal building stones of the Swanage district; near the base of this subdivision there is a , bed from which an interesting suite of mammalian remains has been obtained; in this portion of the Purbeck Group there are some marine bands. The Lower Purbeck consists of fresh-water and terrestrial deposits, marls, and limestones (the famous Portland limestone) with several fossil soils known as dirt beds. This division is very extensively exposed on the Isle of Portland, where many of the individual beds are known by distinctive names. The chief building stones of Upwey belong to this part of the Purbeck Group. = Fossil content = Thrombolites in the basal part of the Purbeck Group, Isle of Portland No zonal fossil has been recognized for the British Purbeckian strata, but the horizon is approximately equivalent to that of Pensphinctes transilorius of the European continent. The Purbeckian equivalents of Spilsby and Speeton are in the zone of Belemnites lateralis. Other marine fossils are Hemicidaris purbeckensis and Ostrea distonta, the latter being abundant in the Cinder bed of the Middle Purbeck. The fresh-water mollusca include Viviparus (Paludina), Planorbis, Melanopsis, Unio, Cyrena. A large number of insect genera has been found in the Middle and Lower Purbeck Group. Dinosaurs (Owenodon, Echinodon [known from \\"Isolated skull elements of at least [three] individuals.\\"\\"Table 18.1,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Page 394.]), crocodylians (Goniopholis, Petrosuchus), Cimoliosaurus, the plesiosaurs and the chelonians (Chelone, Pleurosternum) are representative reptiles. The mammals, mostly determined from lower jaws, found in the beds mentioned above include Plagiaulax, Amblotherium, Stylodon, Dorsetodon, Triconodon, Spalacothenium and several others. The isopod crustacean Archeoniscus brodei is very common in the Purbeck of the Vale of Wardour. Reptile remains diagnostic to the genus level (Megalosaurus sp (theropod indet), Opisthias) are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. 861 pp. . Fossil eggs referable to the oogenus Mycomorphoolithus are also known from the Purbeck Group.Miguel Moreno-Azanza, Jose Ignacio Canudo, and Jose Manuel Gasca. (2015) \\"Enigmatic Early Cretaceous ootaxa from Western Europe with signals of extrinsic eggshell degradation\\" Cretaceous Research 56: 617-627. The silicified stumps and trunks of cycads and coniferous trees, often surrounded by great masses of calcareous concretions (burrs), are very noticeable in the dirt beds of Portland and near Lulworth. Chara is found in the fresh-water cherts of the Middle Purbeck.  Use in construction  Purbeck quarry in southern England The building stones of the Purbeck Group have already been mentioned; the Purbeck or Paludina \\"marble\\", a grey or greenish limestone full of shells, was formerly extensively employed in cathedrals and churches. Stone tiles or slatts were once used locally for roofing from the Lower Purbeck of Portland, Swanage and Swindon. Gypsum was formerly worked from the Lower Purbeck at Swanage.

Jack Board was a wicketkeeper and a right-handed batsman who started out as a tail-ender but developed into a useful player who often opened the innings for his county, Gloucestershire. Picked by W. G. Grace out of Bristol club cricket for the South v North match at Lord's in 1891, Board went straight into the Gloucestershire side afterwards and stayed there for 20 years. In 1895, he set the county record for dismissals in a season, with 75. As a batsman, he scored 214 in 210 minutes against Somerset in 1900,Gloucestershire v Somerset 1900 the highest by a Gloucestershire wicketkeeper, and in 1903 he shared in a sixth wicket partnership of 320 with Gilbert Jessop against Sussex at Hove, though his share was just 71, while Jessop scored 286.Sussex v Gloucestershire 1903 The stand remains the county record for the sixth wicket. Board toured Australia in 1897-98 under A.E. Stoddart without playing in the Tests, and twice toured South Africa, where he played his only Tests. He went with Lord Hawke in 1898‚Äì99, and won his first two Test caps; he top-scored in his first Test innings, but then never exceeded the 29 he scored in that match. In 1905‚Äì06, he played in four Test matches in the tour led by Plum Warner. Board was born in Clifton, Bristol. A gardener by trade before he took to professional cricket, he became a well-known cricket coach at the end of his career. From 1910, he went each winter to New Zealand, where he coached and played for Hawke's Bay, returning each English summer for a few games for Gloucestershire. After the First World War, he became an umpire in English cricket and combined that with winters in South Africa coaching. It was on the return trip from South Africa to England in 1924 aboard the Kenilworth Castle that he had a heart attack and died.

In one system, the leading and/or trailing edge sections of the whole wing pivot to increase the effective camber of the wing. This may be used to increase the maximum lift coefficient in order to shorten the take-off run, or to enhance manoeuvrability in the air. An early example was flown on the Westland N.16 of 1917.Lukins, A.H.; The book of Westland aircraft, Aircraft (Technical) Publications Ltd, (1943 or 1944). Although flaps on the trailing or leading edge of a wing do vary the overall camber and are sometimes described as camber‚Äìchanging flaps, they do not vary the main lifting surface in the same way that a variable-camber wing does. Various other mechanisms have been tried. These include a device that controls the location and shape of the entire upper surface of the airfoil, a retractable bridge that connects two separate high aspect ratio wings, turning them into a single low aspect ratio wing or with telescopic segments that could be forced out, increasing the thickness, chord and shape of the affected portion of the wing.

The screenplay was written by Leigh Brackett, who co-wrote the screenplay for Chandler's The Big Sleep in 1946. The film stars Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe and features Sterling Hayden, Nina Van Pallandt, Jim Bouton, Mark Rydell and an early uncredited appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The story's period was moved from 1949‚Äì50 to 1970s Hollywood. The Long Goodbye has been described as \\"a study of a moral and decent man cast adrift in a selfish, self-obsessed society where lives can be thrown away without a backward glance ... and any notions of friendship and loyalty are meaningless.\\"O'Brien, Daniel. Robert Altman: Hollywood Survivor. London: B.T. Batsford, 1995. p. 53. . See also: Phillips, Gene C. (2000). Creatures of Darkness: Raymond Chandler, Detective Fiction and Film Noir. Lexington, KY: The University Press of Kentucky. pp. 156 and 265. Plot Late one night, private investigator Philip Marlowe is visited by his close friend Terry Lennox, who asks for a lift from Los Angeles to the California‚ÄìMexico border at Tijuana. Marlowe obliges. On returning home, Marlowe is met by two police detectives, who accuse Lennox of having murdered his rich wife, Sylvia. Marlowe refuses to give them any information, so they arrest him. After he is jailed for three days, the police release him, because they have learned that Lennox has committed suicide in Mexico. The police and the press seem to believe it is an obvious case, but Marlowe does not accept the official facts. Marlowe is hired by Eileen Wade, the wife of Roger Wade, an alcoholic novelist with writer's block, whose macho, Hemingway- like persona is proving self-destructive. She asks that Marlowe find her missing husband. He has had regular alcoholic binges and days-long disappearances from their Malibu home in the past. In the course of investigating Mrs. Wade's missing husband, Marlowe visits the subculture of private detoxification clinics for rich alcoholics and drug addicts. He locates and recovers Roger Wade and learns that the Wades knew the Lennoxes socially. He suspects that there is more to Lennox's suicide and the murder of Sylvia. Marlowe incurs the wrath of gangster Marty Augustine, who wants money returned that Lennox owed him. Augustine maims his mistress to demonstrate what could happen to Marlowe, saying, \\"That's someone I love. You, I don't even like.\\" After a side-trip to Mexico, where officials corroborate the details of Lennox's death, Marlowe returns to the Wades' house. A party breaks up after an argument over Roger's unpaid bill from the detoxification clinic. Later that night, Eileen and Marlowe are interrupted when she sees a drunken Roger wandering into the sea; before they can stop him, he drowns. Eileen confesses that Roger had been having an affair with Sylvia, and might have killed her. Marlowe tells this to the police, who remain satisfied that Roger's time at the clinic provides an alibi. Marlowe visits Augustine, whose missing money has been returned. Marlowe sees Eileen driving away. While running after her car, he is struck by a car and hospitalized. Waking up, he is given a harmonica by the heavily-bandaged patient in the next bed. Going back to Malibu, he finds the Wade house being packed up by a real estate company and Eileen gone. He returns to Mexico, where he bribes local officials into revealing the truth. They confess to having set up Terry's apparent suicide and admit he is alive and well in a Mexican villa. Marlowe finds Terry, who admits to killing Sylvia. He reveals he is having an affair with Eileen, that Roger had discovered the affair and disclosed it to Sylvia, after which he (Terry) killed her in the course of a violent argument. Terry gloats that Marlowe fell for his manipulations, saying the PI was \\"a born loser.\\" Marlowe says, \\"Yeah, I even lost my cat.\\" He shoots and kills Terry, then walks away, passing Eileen, who is on her way to meeting Terry. Marlowe pulls out his harmonica and plays it while strolling jauntily down the road.

By the time of Chandler's death, the only novels of his that had not been made into films were The Long Goodbye and Playback. In October 1965 it was announced the rights to Goodbye were held by producers Elliott Kastner and Jerry Gershwin who would make it the following year in Los Angeles and Mexico.Gene Kelly Readies Musical Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 13 Oct 1965: d12. In 1967 producer Gregory Katzka had the rights.Bobby Morse to Co- Star Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 10 June 1967: b7.

Stirling Silliphant, who wrote Marlowe, did a script. However the film was not made and MGM let their option lapse.Fade-out on Raymond Chandler Lochte, Richard S. Chicago Tribune 14 Dec 1969: 60. Producers Jerry Bick and Elliott Kastner bought the rights back and made a production deal with the United Artists distribution company for them to finance.McGilligan 1989, p. 360. Sales of Chandler had been consistent over the years and in the early 1970s the author's books were selling as much as when Chandler was alive. =Leigh Brackett= They commissioned the screenplay from Leigh Brackett, who had been Kastner's client when he was an agent and had written the script for the Humphrey Bogart version of The Big Sleep. Brackett: > ... set the deal with United Artists, and they had a commitment for a film > with Elliott Gould, so either you take Elliott Gould or you don't make the > film. Elliott Gould was not exactly my idea of Philip Marlowe, but anyway > there we were.

If you did it the > way he wrote it, you would have a five-hour film. Brian G. Hutton, who had made a number of movies for Kastner, was originally attached as director and Brackett says Hutton wanted the script structured so that \\"the heavy had planned the whole thing from the start\\" but when writing it she found the idea contrived.Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s By Patrick McGilligan p23 The producers offered the script to both Howard Hawks and Peter Bogdanovich to direct it. Both refused the offer, but Bogdanovich recommended Robert Altman. =Robert Altman= United Artists president David Picker may have picked Gould to play Marlowe as a ploy to get Altman to direct. At the time, Gould was in professional disfavor because of his rumored troubles on the set of A Glimpse of Tiger, in which he bickered with costar Kim Darby, fought with director Anthony Harvey, and acted erratically. Consequently, he had not worked in nearly two years; nevertheless, Altman convinced Bick that Gould suited the role. United Artists had Elliott Gould undergo the usual employment medical examination, and also a psychological examination attesting to his mental stability.McGilligan 1989, p. 361. In January 1972 it was announced Altman and Gould would make the film.Gould, Altman Team for 'Long Goodbye' Haber, Joyce. Los Angeles Times 27 Jan 1972: f12. Altman called the film \\"a satire in melancholy.\\"Altman, Gould Reunited for 'Goodbye' Warga, Wayne. Los Angeles Times 23 July 1972: u1 In adapting Chandler's book, Leigh Brackett had problems with its plot, which she felt was \\"riddled with cliches\\", and faced the choice of making it a period piece or updating it.McGilligan 1989, p. 363. Altman received a copy of the script while shooting Images in Ireland. He liked the ending because it was so out of character for Marlowe. He agreed to direct but only if the ending was not changed.Thompson 2005, p. 75. Brackett recalled meeting Altman while doing Images. \\"We conferred about ten o'clock in the morning and yakked all day, and I went back to the hotel and typed all the notes and went back the next day. In a week we had it all worked out. He was a joy to work with. He had a very keen story mind.\\" Altman and Brackett spent a lot of time talking over the plot. Altman wanted Marlowe to be a loser. He even nicknamed Gould's character Rip Van Marlowe, as if he had been asleep for 20 years, had woken up, and was wandering around Los Angeles in the early 1970s but \\"trying to invoke the morals of a previous era\\".Thompson 2005, p. 76. Brackett says her first draft was too long, and she shortened it, but the ending was inconclusive. She had Marlowe shooting Terry Lennox.McGilligan 1989, p. 364. Altman conceived of the film as a satire and made several changes to the script, like having Roger Wade commit suicide and having Marty Augustine smash a Coke bottle across his girlfriend's face. Altman said, \\"it was supposed to get the attention of the audience and remind them that, in spite of Marlowe, there is a real world out there, and it is a violent world\\".McGilligan 1989, p. 365. \\"Chandler fans will hate my guts,\\" said Altman. \\"I don't give a damn.\\"Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe Michaels, Ken.

Principal photography Altman did not read all of Chandler's book and instead utilized Raymond Chandler Speaking, a collection of letters and essays. He gave copies of this book to the cast and crew, advising them to study the author's literary essays. The opening scene with Philip Marlowe and his cat came from a story a friend of Altman's told him about his cat only eating one type of cat food. Altman saw it as a comment on friendship. The director decided that the camera should never stop moving, and put it on a dolly.Thompson 2005, p. 77. However, the camera movements would counter the actions of the characters so that the audience would feel like a voyeur. To compensate for the harsh light of Southern California, Altman gave the film a soft pastel look reminiscent of old postcards from the 1940s. When it came to the scenes between Philip Marlowe and Roger Wade, Altman had Elliott Gould and Sterling Hayden ad lib most of their dialogue because, according to the director, Hayden was drunk and stoned on marijuana most of the time. Altman was reportedly thrilled by Hayden's performance, despite him being second choice to Blocker. Altman's home in Malibu Colony was used as the location for the scenes that took place in Wade's house. \\"I hope it works,\\" said Altman during filming. \\"We've got a script but we don't follow it closely.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack of The Long Goodbye features two songs, \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye\\", composed by John Williams and Johnny Mercer. It was Altman's idea to have every occurrence of the latter song arranged differently, from hippie chant to supermarket muzak to radio music, setting the mood for the hero's encounters with eccentric Californians, while pursuing his case.Thompson 2005, p. 80. Var√®se Sarabande released selections from Williams' score on a CD in 2004 paired with the album re-recording of Williams' music from Fitzwilly; in 2015 Quartet Records issued a CD entirely devoted to The Long Goodbye. Home media The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on September 17, 2002. Release =Initial release= The Long Goodbye was previewed at the Tarrytown Conference Center in Tarrytown, New York. The gala was hosted by Judith Crist, then the film critic for New York magazine. The film was not well received by the audience, except for Nina van Pallandt's performance. Altman attended a question-and-answer session afterward, where the mood was \\"vaguely hostile\\", reportedly leaving the director \\"depressed\\". The Long Goodbye was not well received by critics during its limited release in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Miami. Time magazine's Jay Cocks wrote, \\"Altman's lazy, haphazard putdown is without affection or understanding, a nose-thumb not only at the idea of Philip Marlowe but at the genre that his tough-guy-soft-heart character epitomized. It is a curious spectacle to see Altman mocking a level of achievement to which, at his best, he could only aspire\\". Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times found the film \\"quite sleek, marvelously and inventively photographed ... The problem is that the Altman-Brackett Marlowe, played by Elliott Gould, is an untidy, unshaven, semiliterate, dim-wit slob who could not locate a missing skyscraper and would be refused service at a hot dog stand. He is not Chandler's Marlowe, or mine, and I can't find him interesting, sympathetic or amusing, and I can't be sure who will.\\"Champlin, Charles (March 8, 1973). \\"A Private Eye's Honor, Blackened\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"is not a movie version of the Chandler mystery that anyone with a liking for Chandler could possibly enjoy ... If you are not prepared to shuffle along from scene to pointless, protracted scene with klutzy old Elliott, there will be little to occupy your time or offset your annoyance.\\"Arnold, Gary (March 22, 1973). \\"The Long Goodbye\\". The Washington Post. D19. Roger Ebert, however, gave the film three out of four stars and praised Elliott Gould's \\"good performance, particularly the virtuoso ten- minute stretch at the beginning of the movie when he goes out to buy food for his cat. Gould has enough of the paranoid in his acting style to really put over Altman's revised view of the private eye\\". Gene Siskel also liked the film and gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it \\"a most satisfying motion picture\\" with Gould displaying \\"surprising finesse and reserve\\" in his performance, though he faulted the \\"convoluted and too quickly resolved plot.\\"Siskel, Gene (March 27, 1973). \\"The Long Goodbye\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. The New York opening was canceled at the last minute after several advance screenings had already been held for the press. The film was abruptly withdrawn from release with rumors that it would be re-edited. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"An ice-cold noir that retains Robert Altman's idiosyncratic sensibilities, The Long Goodbye ranks among the smartest and most satisfying Marlowe mysteries.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" =Re-release= Studio executives analyzed the reviews for months, concluding that the reason for the film's failure was the misleading advertising campaign in which it had been promoted as a \\"detective story\\". They spent $40,000 on a new release campaign, which included a poster by Mad magazine artist Jack Davis.McGilligan 1989, p. 367. When The Long Goodbye was re-released, reviewer Vincent Canby wrote, \\"it's an original work, complex without being obscure, visually breathtaking without seeming to be inappropriately fancy\\". Pauline Kael's lengthy review in The New Yorker called the film \\"a high-flying rap on Chandler and the movies\\", hailed Gould's performance as \\"his best yet\\" and praised Altman for achieving \\"a self-mocking fairy-tale poetry\\".Kael, Pauline (October 22, 1973). \\"The Current Cinema\\". The New Yorker. 133-137. Despite Kael's effusive endorsement and its influence among younger critics, The Long Goodbye was relatively unpopular and earned poorly in the rest of the United States. The New York Times listed it in its Ten Best List for film for that year, while Vilmos Zsigmond was awarded the National Society of Film Critics' prize for Best Cinematographer.McGilligan 1989, p. 362. Ebert later ranked it among his Great Movies collection and wrote, \\"Most of its effect comes from the way it pushes against the genre, and the way Altman undermines the premise of all private eye movies, which is that the hero can walk down mean streets, see clearly, and tell right from wrong\\". Changes from the novel The 1973 cinematic adaptation deviates markedly from the 1953 novel. Screenwriter Leigh Brackett took many literary liberties with the story, plot and characters of The Long Goodbye in her adaptation. In the film, Marlowe kills his best friend, Terry Lennox. The father of millionairess Sylvia Lennox does not appear in the film; Roger Wade commits suicide in the film, rather than being murdered; and gangster Marty Augustine and his subplots are additions to the film. The film quotes from the novel when Marlowe, under police interrogation, asks, \\"Is this where I'm supposed to say, 'What's all this about?' and he [the cop] says, 'Shut up! I ask the questions'?\\"The Long Goodbye, Houghton Mifflin, p. 28 Throughout the film are stylistic nods to the Chandler novels and 1950s American culture. Marlowe drives a 1948 Lincoln Continental Convertible Cabriolet, in contrast with the contemporary cars driven by others in the film. Marlowe also chain smokes in the film, in contrast with a health- conscious California; no one else smokes on screen. As a reference to the American iconography which Chandler used in his novels, Marlowe wears a tie with American flags on it (the tie looks plain red in the movie due to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond's post-flashing).Rip Van Marlowe, Director Greg Carson, 2002. A \\"making-of\\" featurette on the DVD is entitled \\"Rip van Marlowe\\", a reference to the character Rip Van Winkle, to emphasize the contrast between Marlowe's anachronistic 1950s behavior and the film's 1970s setting.

Millers Flat is a small town (population about 200) in inland Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand. It is located on the Clutha River, 17 kilometres south of Roxburgh. Fruit growing is the main industry in the area. Most of the town lies on the north bank of the Clutha; the main road, State Highway 8, passes close by on the river's other bank. The Roxburgh Branch railway used to pass through the town; it was opened to Millers Flat in 1925 and was the terminus for approximately two and a half years, until the section to Roxburgh was opened. The line was closed in 1968, though the town's station platform and some of the railway formation still exist. Millers Flat was originally called Ovens Hill; its current name is in honour of an early European settler, Walter Miller, who farmed in the area from about 1849. Millers Flat Bridge was designed by Robert Hay (1847‚Äì1928) and construction started in 1897. It was opened in 1899. Approximately 8 km downstream of Millers Flat on the Clutha River are the remains of the Horseshoe Bend Gold Diggings, now largely remembered for the story of \\"Somebody's Darling\\" and the Lonely Graves. Early in 1865 the body of a young man was discovered at Rag Beach, upstream and on the opposite side of the river from the present site of the Lonely Graves. An inquest held on 22 February 1865 in the Horseshoe Hotel determined the body to be that of Charles Alms who had fallen in the river at Mutton Town Creek, some considerable distance upstream. Alms, a butcher from the Nevis had been swimming cattle across the river when he had been thrown from his horse and washed away. The body was buried in an unmarked grave and the gravesite remained untended. Later in that same year a miner named William Rigney arrived at Horseshoe Bend, and with John Ord erected a fence of rough manuka poles around the previously untended grave. Rigney obtained a piece of black pine and made a simple headstone for the grave. With a four-inch nail he inscribed the words \\"Somebody's Darling lies buried here.\\" In 1903 a marble headstone was erected. William Rigney died in 1912 and was buried beside \\"Somebody's Darling.\\" Education Millers Flat School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

Along with Albert Hallam, his support for Briggs and Mold gave Lancashire its first official County championship victory in 1897. His bowling was also important to Lancashire's Championship win seven years later, in which they went through the whole season without being beaten. Cuttell was a slow right-arm bowler who possessed the unusual ability to turn the ball from leg without throwing it up enough to encourage risk-taking batsmen to attack him. He was very accurate in length and also possessed the characteristic break-back of most bowlers of his time, which made him as unplayable as any bowler when the pitch helped him. He was very slow to move into first-class cricket. Cuttell's early cricket was played for the Accrington Club in the Lancashire League. Having been born in Yorkshire and his father William Cuttell having played for them in the 1860s, he decided to try for a place in the Yorkshire eleven. However, his form in a couple of matches against opposition that was not recognised as first-class was not encouraging, so that Willis returned to league cricket. From 1891 he shifted to the Nelson Club (later famous as where Ted McDonald played when qualifying for Lancashire) and proved himself the best bowler in league cricket. In 1895 he took 106 wickets for 8¬Ω runs apiece and in 1893 as many as 118 wickets fell to his bowling in league games. Cuttell, long qualified by residence for Lancashire, was finally engaged by them for the season of 1896. He played only two games and then was dropped, but the following year, after a rather slow start, Cuttell showed himself right up to the standard of first-class county cricket. On hard pitches he was never especially difficult, but on the softer pitches at the end of the season he was frequently deadly, taking twelve for 81 in the last match against Nottinghamshire. His work on soft pitches was deadly enough for him to head the Lancashire averages for all first-class games and was chosen as Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1898, with Hallam ill, Mold injured more than once, and Briggs terribly out of form, Cuttell became the mainstay of Lancashire cricket. Although his wickets were very expensive considering the many rain-affected wickets, his batting advanced so much that he accomplished the \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. He achieved his best haul of eight for 105 against Gloucestershire on a good pitch in July. He toured South Africa because the matting wickets were expected to suit his style, but did nothing of remarkable quality in his only Tests. The following year, with very few pitches to help him, Cuttell was less successful as a bowler and could not gain a place against Australia, but he batted very well, scoring 137 against Nottinghamshire and scoring more runs than in any other season. 1900 saw Cuttell re-assert himself as one of the best bowlers in England, but with Rhodes and Haigh establishing themselves as the deadliest bowlers on sticky wickets Cuttell's days as a representative player were over. 1901 to 1903 were very disappointing both in batting and bowling, but in 1904 Cuttell's bowling on several sticky wickets in May was decisive in giving Lancashire a surprise championship win after losing Sydney Barnes. Despite a dreadful 1905, Cuttell bowled with deadly effect in 1906, being ahead even of Haigh in the national bowling averages despite taking over 100 fewer wickets. However, aged 43, he had already decided on the post of coach at Rugby School, which he held right through to 1926. At the age of 63, he then became an umpire in county matches, but could carry out this role for only two years before his health deteriorated too much.

It is generally considered to encompass the interval now covered by the Berriasian, Valanginian and Hauterivian, from approximately 145 to 130 Ma. It was introduced by Jules Thurmann in 1835 on account of the development of these rocks at Neuch√¢tel (Neocomum), Switzerland. It has been employed in more than one sense. In the type area the rocks have been divided into two sub- stages, a lower, Valanginian (from Valengin, Pierre Jean √âdouard Desor, 1854) and an upper, Hauterivian (from Hauterive, Eug√®ne Renevier, 1874); there is also another local sub-stage, the infra-Valanginian or Berriasian (from Berrias, Henri Coquand, 1876). These three sub-stages constitute the Neocomian in its restricted sense. Adolf von Koenen and other German geologists extend the use of the term to include the whole of the Lower Cretaceous up to the top of the Gault or Albian. Eug√®ne Renevier divided the Lower Cretaceous into the Neocomian division, embracing the three sub-stages mentioned above, and an Urgonian division, including the Barremian, Rhodanian and Aptian sub-stages. Sir A. Geikie (Text Book of Geology, 4th ed., 1903) regards Neocomian as synonymous with Lower Cretaceous, and he, like Renevier, closes this portion of the system at the top of the Lower Greensand (Aptian). Other British geologists (A. J. Jukes-Browne, &c.;) restrict the Neocomian to the marine beds of Speeton and Tealby, and their estuarine equivalents, the Weald Clay and Hastings Sands (Wealden). Much confusion would be avoided by dropping the term Neocomian entirely and employing instead, for the type area, the sub- divisions given above. This becomes the more obvious when it is pointed out that the Berriasian type is limited to Dauphine; the Valanginian has not a much wider range; and the Hauterivian does not extend north of the Paris basin. Characteristic fossils of the Berriasian are Hoplites euthymi, H. occitanicus; of the Valanginian, Natica leviathan, Bel√©mnites pistilliformis and B. dilatatus, Oxynoticeras Gevrili; of the Hauterivian, Hoplites radiatus, Crioceras capricornu, Exogyra Couloni and Toxaster complanatus. The marine equivalents of these rocks in England are the lower Speeton Clays of Yorkshire and the Tealby beds of Lincolnshire. The Wealden beds of southern England represent approximately an estuarine phase of deposit of the same age. The Hils clay of Germany and Wealden of Hanover; the limestones and shales of Teschen; the Aptychus and Pygope diphyoides marls of Spain, and the Petchorian formation of Russia are equivalents of the Neocomian in its narrower sense.

Bopara was first called up to the England One Day International team in 2007, before a difficult Test debut in Sri Lanka saw him dropped in early 2008 after a string of three ducks. He regained his place for a Test against the West Indies in the winter of 2008‚Äì09; on his return to the side, Bopara became the fifth batsman to score three consecutive Test centuries for England.

Bopara's score was just the eighth instance of a double hundred in the history of List A cricket and the highest for six years. On 9 September 2008 Bopara was named in England's 15-man squad for the inaugural Stanford Super Series in Antigua. There, England took on the Middlesex Crusaders and Trinidad and Tobago before facing the Stanford All-Stars on 1 November. The winning players in that match would have earned $1million each, with a further $1million being shared between the four players left out of the side. This never came to fruition, however, as England fell to a heavy defeat in the final. The same day, Bopara was also handed an Increment Contract by the ECB. =2008 New Zealand, South Africa and India= Bopara made just three in the first ODI in New Zealand. He made 23 in the next match, but did not bowl in either matches. In the return series in England, Bopara got off to a slow start, making scores of 10 and 27 in his first two matches. However, in the fourth match of the series he made 58 although it wasn't enough to prevent a narrow defeat for England. He made 30 in the final match of the series, leaving him with over 100 runs in the matches he played in. He played in the first ODI against South Africa but was not required to bat, instead just bowling two overs and conceding 11 runs. England won the match by 20 runs. He made 54 not out in the first ODI against India as he continued to consolidate himself in the ODI side. In the third match he made 60, although England lost the game by 16 runs. In the final match of the series he took figures of 1‚Äì42 as well as contributing 24 runs with the bat, although England again lost, this time by six wickets. =2009 T20 World Cup, West Indies and Australia= On 18 February 2009, Bopara, along with Amjad Khan, was invited to join the England Test squad on their tour of the West Indies as cover for Andrew Flintoff who was struggling with a hip injury. He scored 124 not out in a warm up match, earning him a place in the 4th Test against the West Indies. In the first innings he scored his maiden Test century with 104 off 143 balls before being caught. He was dropped for the next Test of the series, however he was re- selected for the first Test of the home series against the West Indies on 6 May. There he scored his second consecutive Test century, scoring 143 runs from 186 balls. He then scored another century in the second Test, becoming only the fifth England player to score three consecutive centuries. He credited his success to his coaching by Graham Gooch at Essex. Bopara played well in England's opening game of the T20 World Cup, hitting 46 against the Netherlands. He made 37 against India before 55 against the West Indies, although England lost the match by 5 wickets. This meant that England progress no further in the competition despite being on home soil. Australians Mitchell Johnson and Ricky Ponting stated to local media that during the upcoming 2009 Ashes series they were going to target Bopara in particular. Bopara getting hit in the throat by a bouncer during the first Test of the 2009 Ashes series at the SWALEC Stadium. On 22 June, the England selectors announced a sixteen- man preliminary Ashes squad for that summer's series; it included Bopara. Cricinfo staff wrote that \\"Bopara's stock could not be higher\\". He found success in a warm-up match against Warwickshire, however, scoring 104 while opening with Andrew Strauss. Bopara struggled during the series, however, with scores of 35, one, 18, 27, 23, one and a duck. He was dismissed by Ben Hilfenhaus in five of his seven innings. Speculation grew about his position for the final Test, where England required a win to regain the Ashes, and it was announced on 16 August that Bopara had been dropped in favour of uncapped Jonathan Trott, who went on to score a century on debut. Bopara returned to Essex and scored 201 against Surrey, and despite being replaced in the Test team remained in England's squads for the ODI series against Australia and the Champions Trophy in September. On 11 September 2009 it was announced that Bopara had been awarded an \\"incremental contract\\" with England, as had Trott. However, after the Champions Trophy Bopara did not play ODI cricket for ten months. =2010 Bangladesh and Pakistan= Trott kept his Test place after his impressive debut, and Bopara saw Michael Carberry and Eoin Morgan make their Tests debuts in the away and home series against Bangladesh respectively, with Bopara making neither squad. However, some impressive form for Essex in domestic 40-over and Twenty20 cricket in 2010, as well as a century for the England Lions saw him recalled to the ODI team for the series decider against Bangladesh, after an injury to Ian Bell. Bopara hit a late innings of 45 not out from just 16 balls and took career-best ODI bowling figures of 4/38. His convincing performance led to his selection in the two-match T20 series against Pakistan. England won both matches, but Bopara had little impact, making scores of 11 and 12. Despite this, Bopara played in the ODI series, making 35 runs in the first game as England won by 24 runs. England won the next game, although Bopara only made 16 runs. His poor form continued as England suffered defeat in the final game and Bopara scored just 7 runs.

His stay in the Caribbean was cut short when he was called up to England's World Cup squad before the tournament as a replacement for the injured Eoin Morgan. Bopara played in England's opening match against the Netherlands and scored a match-winning 30 from 20 balls. After that, he did not play against India and Ireland as England chose to field a second spinner, Michael Yardy. Bopara returned to play against South Africa in place of the dropped Paul Collingwood. Bopara came in with the score at 15/3 and managed a partnership of 99 with Trott; Bopara ended with 60 off 98 balls. England restricted South Africa to 165 and Bopara was named the man of the match. England lost he next match by two wickets against Bangladesh, with Bopara scoring 16 runs. Bopara did not perform well against he West Indies, making just 4 with the bat, although England went on to win by 18 runs and progress to the quarter finals. Here, England were thrashed by ten wickets as Sri Lanka's openers made light work of England's target. Bopara scored 31 when he batted in the first innings. In 2011, Bopara turned down ¬£100,000 to play for the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL as a late replacement for the injured Paul Collingwood. After Collingwood retired from Tests, Bopara and Morgan were the leading contenders to take his place in the side. Bopara, who had already scored two centuries in the County Championship by May, was the favourite but an innings of 193 by Morgan for the England Lions against the touring Sri Lankans kept Bopara out of the Test side. After missing out on the series against Sri Lanka, he returned to the team in August for the third Test against India in place of the injured Trott. However, he could only manage 7 runs despite big scores from England's other batsmen. He kept his place for the next match, this time performing better with an unbeaten 44 as England went on to win the series 4‚Äì0 and become the best Test Team in the World. In the following ODI series with India, Bopara was England's top run scorer with 197. He made 24 in his first game of the series and followed his up with 40 in the next match. In the tied fourth ODI Bopara hit a career-best 96 before being dismissed by Munaf Patel. He finished the series making an unbeaten 37 as England went on to win the series. In the return ODI series in India, Bopara was less effective. He made 8 as England won the first match followed by 36 in the second, which turned out to be his highest score of the series. He made 24 in the third ODI, but only made 8 and 4 in the final matches as England lost the series 3‚Äì2. On 23 September 2011, Bopara claimed the best bowling figures by an Englishman in a T20 international with 4/10. =2012 Pakistan and West Indies= In the ODI series against Pakistan, Bopara contributed with both bat and ball. After hitting 50 in the first match, he followed this up with 58 in the second match of the series, as England won by 20 runs. He was not required to bat in the final match of the series, as England won the match by 9 wickets. Despite losing his place in the test side, Bopara continued to play in the One Day and Twenty20 sides. He batted at number 4 in the opening ODI against the West Indies, making just 8. in the second game, he guided England to victory with an unbeaten 19. This gave England a 2‚Äì0 lead in the best of three series. In the only T20 International between the two sides, Bopara made 59 and helped England win the game. Throughout the series Bopara had also been used as a bowler, with batsman struggling to score of his medium pacers. Bopara also gained a reputation as a partnership breaker. =2012 Australia and South Africa= He was a key player for England in the limited overs series against Australia. He made 82 in the second ODI which led to him receiving the man of the match award. In the fourth game of the series he made 33 to help England win by 8 wickets, before hitting an unbeaten half century in the final match of the series to help England to another convincing victory. Following his impressive form in limited overs cricket, Bopara was selected to play for the Test team in the opening Test against South Africa. However, he was out for a duck in the first innings as England slumped to defeat. Bopara was replaced by James Taylor for the second Test. Bopara returned for the ODI Series, making 16 in the second ODI. Although he was dismissed for a duck in the third game, he took 1‚Äì31 of ten overs to help England level the series. However, he continued to struggle with the bat, making 16 runs in the next two matches. Bopara continues to be used to bowl overs, as he continued to be economical and pick up occasional wickets. Bopara was left out of the T20 team that toured India in 2013. He also went on to play no part in the ODI series, with the likes of Samit Patel and Chris Woakes being preferred instead. This was largely due to Bopara's poor form with the bat. Bopara was again overlooked for the T20 series against New Zealand. Bopara again missed out on selection for the ODI team against New Zealand, with many suggesting that his international was now over. =2013 Champions Trophy and Australia= Bopara returned to the England team for the 2013 Champions Trophy, now batting in the number 6 position. He made an unbeaten 46 against Australia to help guide England to victory. In the second game he was again unbeaten, making 33 and also bowled six overs. However, in a close game Sri Lanka won meaning England had to win their last game to qualify. They did so after beating New Zealand, with Bopara taking 2‚Äì26 in a low scoring match. England convincingly beat South Africa in the semi final, with Bopara not being required to bat. In the final against India, Bopara took figures of 3‚Äì20 and also made 30 during a big partnership with Eoin Morgan, However, once the pair were out the England innings fell apart and India went on to lift the trophy. Following his good performance in the Champions Trophy, Bopara kept his place in the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand. He played in the hard ODI, making 28 and bowling 6 overs for just 21 runs. England went on to win the match but lose the series. In the T20 series he made an unbeaten 30 in the first game, but was expensive with the ball. England went on to lose the match. Although Bopara was selected for the second ODI, the game was rained off. Although Bopara never played in the Ashes series, he played in the two T20 Internationals. In the first match, which England lost, he scored 45 and participated in an impressive partnership with Joe Root. Bopara played in the second match which England won to tie the series. With many Test players rested for the ODI Series, Bopara was one of the most experienced players in the squad. He took 2‚Äì57 in the second ODI, and made 62 in the final match of the series. Throughout the series, Bopara was used to finish off the innings by accelerating towards the end. Bopara also bowled in long spells instead of the occasional spell. Bopara joined up with the England squad for the tour of Australia for the limited overs series, after the Test team had already lost 5‚Äì0. Things did not get much better in the ODI series, as they went on to lose 4‚Äì1. During the series, Bopara made 19 in the first match, before making a quick fire 26 in the second. He also took his first wicket of the tour in the second match. He then made 21 in the third match, before making 3 in the fourth, which turned out to be England's only win on the tour. He was stumped on the final match when on 25. He played in all three of the T20 games, scoring 65 from 27 balls in the first match although England lost by 13 runs. In the next two games he only managed 10 runs as England lost the series 3‚Äì0. =2014 West Indies, T20 World Cup and Sri Lanka= In the limited overs tour of the West Indies, Bopara made scores of 23, 38 not out and 5 not out. This gave him an impressive average of 66. Bopara bowled just 5 overs in the series, taking 1 wicket. In the T20 series, Bopara hit 42 in the first game, although England went on to lose. He made 14 in England's score of 152 in the second, although it ended in another defeat. He made an unbeaten 6 in the final game to help England avoid a whitewash, instead losing the series 2‚Äì1. In the 2014 T20 World Cup, Bopara scored an unbeaten 24 against New Zealand, although England lost the match. He made 11 not out against Sri Lanka and helped finish the game of with Alex Hales to keep England's hopes of qualification alive. He made 31 in the defeat to South Africa, and took figures of 0‚Äì13 in his two overs. Bopara could only make 18 in the humiliating defeat against the Netherlands, although he bowled impressively, taking 0‚Äì15 in his four overs at an economy rate of less than 4 an over. In the entire tournament, Bopara bowled 6 overs for just 28 runs, and also scored 84 runs, making him one of England's stand out performers. Bopara was poor in his first three matches against Sri Lanka. He managed just 10 runs and took just one wicket. He made 51 in the fourth match of the series but could not prevent an England defeat, before being dismissed for 17 in the final match as England again lost, and also lost the series 3‚Äì2. Bopara was left out of the ODI squad against India, which drew criticisms from many pundits. He returned for the T20 between he two sides, making 21 runs as England secured a narrow victory. Bopara returned to the England ODI squad for the tour against Sri Lanka. He made two fifties in the first two matches of the tour, hitting 65 in the first match and 51 in the second. Despite this, England lost both games. In the third ODI he only made six runs, although he did take his first wicket of the series. He made 22 in the fourth match and followed this up by making28 in the fifth ODI, a game England won to keep the series alive. In the sixth ODI of the series, Bopara could only make 13 as England lost the match which meant they could no longer win the series. Bopara was dropped for the final game of tour, but England lost this match to lose the series 5‚Äì2. =2015 Tri-series and World Cup= Bopara endured a poor Tri series against India and Australia. He scored 13 in the first game against Australia as England suffered a defeat, and was not required to bat as England comfortably beat India in the next game.

He picked up figures of 2‚Äì31 and was not needed to bat as England won by nine wickets. T20 franchise career Bopara played for the team Karachi Kings in Pakistan Super League (PSL) held at U.A.E in February 2016.

It is located in the northeast corner of Huron County near the Bruce County border, east of Wingham. Its largest communities are Fordwich, Gorrie and Wroxeter. Smaller hamlets include Belmore and Lakelet. Rural areas comprise the remainder of the township. The township's municipal offices, road works facility, public school, arena and library are located between Fordwich and Gorrie on Huron Road 87 (formerly Ontario Highway 87). History Although Howick Township was one of the four Huron County Townships created out of the Queen's Bush by the Wilkinson survey of 1847, the first settler did not arrive until 1851, and the next in 1853. The township was named after George Grey who entered Parliament in 1829 as Lord Howick, taking the name from Howick Hall, his family's estate in England. In 1854, the lots in the township were put up for sale, resulting in a wave of settlement. During a series of municipal amalgamations in Ontario through the 1990s and ending in 2001, the Township of Howick boundaries remained unchanged. The Township celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2006. Demographics Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 1,295 (total dwellings: 1,372)  Transportation  A very small distance of Highway 9 travels through the extreme northeast corner of Howick Township. Otherwise, no provincial highways serve the township. Huron Road 86 (formerly Highway 86) travels along the southern border of Howick. Gorrie and Wroxeter are located on Huron Road 87 (formerly Highway 87), a significant east‚Äìwest route through Howick. Fordwich is on Huron Road 30, a short distance from Huron Road 87. Huron Road 12 on the western end of Howick serves Wroxeter and Belmore. The remaining county roads in Howick are Huron Road 7 (east‚Äìwest, through Lakelet) and Huron Road 28 (north‚Äìsouth, through Gorrie).

This code is randomly assigned to individual cell phones by the OEM on request of the mobile service operator and prevents the use of a particular phone on a cellular network other than that to which the phone was originally sold. Justification for use of Subsidy Password The term \\"subsidy\\" refers to the subsidization of cell phones sold to customers that purchase mobile phones as part of a contract with the mobile service operator. Many network operators provide these subsidies as an incentive for users to sign extended contracts, and use the subsidy lock as a means of protecting their investment. The installation of such locks means that users often are forced to purchase a different phone if they decide to switch their network (of advantage to both the OEM manufacturer and cellular service provider). CDMA cellular providers that use subsidy locks on their handsets: Ntelos, Cricket, Sprint, Quest, Philippines Cellular, SureWest, Telus & Bell Mobility (Not a complete list) GSM: (SIM unlock) globe smart sun Alltel or Verizon Wireless do not use any type of subsidy locks on their CDMA phones.

Unlocking services and software As a result of the lack of open access to the Subsidy Password database, a number of online services have grown around providing alternative unlocking software. The methods used to unlock cell phones vary although most involve reading the code from the phone and resetting it. Legal concerns = United States = Network carriers will sometimes agree to unlock their customers' phones upon request. While one could consider that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act brings the legality of such applications under question in the United States, recent legal cases such as Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components have confirmed that the use of software to reprogram such phones is not illegal. This is particularly true since unlocking applications increases compatibility with alternative networks, promotes positive competition and allows customers with greater freedom to use the phones that they own. In 2010, the Librarian of Congress exempted unlocking phones from the DMCA. =Other countries= There are no legal prohibitions to unlocking in the United Kingdom or Canada.

The setting was published after the release of the Ravenloft campaign setting in 1994 as Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales, and is regarded as an add- on for that line. Masque of the Red Death has many of the same qualities as Ravenloft, such as \\"power checks\\" and restricted magic, including limited planar travel. Unlike Ravenloft, the location of the adventures is Gothic Earth, an 1890s version of Earth where fantasy creatures exist only in the shadows of civilization. Many notable real-life figures or 19th century literary characters are included for the players to interact with, including Van Helsing, Jack the Ripper and Dorian Gray. In 2004, White Wolf Games released a D20 System version of the setting in hardback under the Sword and Sorcery imprint. Classes In the 3.5 Living Death RPGA Campaign Sourcebook, players can choose from a large list of classes that represent the many different kinds of people and professions that can exist in an 1800s Earth: Adept - spellcasters, equivalent of D&D; wizards in Masque of the Red Death. Athlete - players can choose a specific sport (golf, hockey, football, American football, etc.) and gain bonus feats depending on the sport they choose. This class has many acrobatic and survival skills. Charlatan - spellcasters, equivalent of D&D; sorcerers in Masque of the Red Death, this class also has many rogue skills to choose from. Cowboy - the cowboy receives a d10 for its hit dice. A cowboy also has many good survival and outdoor skills, much like a ranger. Cowboys are proficient in guns and receive skills in gunsmithing and repair. Criminal - This class is an almost exact copy of the rogue, excluding the new class skills it gains that are introduced in Masque of the Red Death. If players do not begin as Criminals, they cannot multi-class and gain Criminal levels unless the DM grants special permission. Dandy - Dandies represent members of the upper class and high society. They receive many skills that involve influence and behavior. This class also receives the \\"Influence\\" ability which allows them to make use of their resources and contacts at DM discretion. Dandies also receive one of the highest salaries in the game. Detective - The detective gains attack bonuses and saves like the rogue, but receives a d8 for hit dice. The Detective has many skills with influence and searching. They also receive the \\"Influence\\" ability, but it is limited to police connections and can only be used once a month. Diletante - Diletantes are members of the rich and high society who enjoy spending their fortunes seeking 'thrills' of the occult nature. Diletantes can cast spells with 'Spiritcraft', which works similarly to divine spells in D&D.; Diletantes gain a -2 penalty to Spot, Search and Initiative rolls that increases by another -2 every 5 levels. Diletantes can turn undead as clerics, following the special turning rules of Masque of Death. Explorer - the equivalent of D&D; rangers in Masque of the Red Death. Explorers gain many skills involving survival and travel. Explorers gain the \\"Track\\" and Wild Empathy feats as the ranger. Explorers receive a -4 penalty to all Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Etiquette, and Gather Information checks with people in metropolitan areas. =Wealth= Each class has a certain amount of cash they receive at the beginning of the game, instead of using normal 3.5 treasure rules. At the beginning of each adventure, or DM discretion, players earn their salaries. Salaries are dependent on a salary chart. Each class gains anywhere from 1-6 d6 dice for salary. Then, by taking the combined score of the players Wisdom and Charisma and dividing that total by 2, and taking the amount of d6s their class earns, they apply these to the chart and find their characters salary. =Spells= Spells of the Masque of Red Death are much more difficult for players to use and learn. All spell casting classes can only gain spells normally their first level. Any further spells must be learned through scrolls or tomes found or given by the DM as reward. A spellcraft or spiritcraft check must be made to see if the spell is successfully learned. In addition, a majority of spells have a vast increase in casting time to further weaken player spell casting. Players must also roll a d100 every time a spell is cast to check if they gain any corruption. The chance of corruption gain varies from spell level and power. If a player gains corruption, they can suffer ill effects like paranoia, madness, lesions, bad eyesight, etc. Spells pertaining to undead and necromancy are far more potent in Masque of the Red Death. This makes it far more difficult for players to maintain control over these spells and much easier for players to gain corruption from them. The Red Death The Red Death is a mysterious evil energy that can manipulate the world. Its very origins are unknown to anyone, but many theories are abound. Some say it is very much like a physical red mist, while others claim it to be a universal force like gravity. What is known is the effects that the Red Death has. It is capable of raising undead, transforming people into monsters, driving people insane, moving whole areas and locations, and affecting the very fabric of reality. The Red Death is an extremely powerful force that comes and goes at its own whim, and is the source of all evil in the Masque of The Red Death world. Adventures An adventure titled Jigsaw appeared in Dungeon #61 (Sep/Oct 1996). The plot concerns a golem (a Frankenstein's Monster like creation) named Udo who wants to marry Victoria Von Lendstein, his creator. She is engaged to another man, and he would rather see her dead. The players must protect Victoria from her creation. An adventure titled Dark Magic in New Orleans appeared in Dungeon #71 (Nov/Dec 1998). The plot concerns the machinations of Voodoo King Doctor John and Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau in 1890s New Orleans. The players must discover who is behind a series of murders in old New Orleans, while avoiding their own deaths.

Located at the midway point of the Bruce Peninsula, about halfway between Owen Sound and Tobermory, Lion's Head is just east of Ferndale on Bruce Road 9. Lion's Head is located on or somewhere near the 45th parallel north, halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. The town is named after the resemblance of a lion's profile in the rock formation of the Niagara Escarpment. The first post office opened in 1895. The estimated summer population ranges widely from 900 to 5000. It is a well travelled holiday spot on the coast of Georgian Bay. The limestone rock formations make it a scenic area for canoeing, kayaking, hiking the Bruce Trail, rock climbing and visiting the marina-lookout by car. Bruce Peninsula District School is the only secondary school north of Wiarton, and one of the few schools in Ontario to go from Kindergarten to grade 12. There are accommodations, restaurants, shops, and galleries all located in Lion's Head. There is also a marina, school, hospital, bank, library, pharmacy, grocery store and several churches in the town. Lion's Head is under the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) jurisdiction. There is also the Northern Bruce Peninsula Fire Department, which operates four trucks in the region. The area has four somewhat distinct seasons. Cold, snowy, and blustery winters, as well as warm, comfortable summers are the usual pattern. Summer mornings are usually cool but do warm quickly before 9 or 10 AM. Rain showers are common, along with thunderstorms, and a few severe thunderstorms per year. Tornadoes are less likely in the region, unlike the far southern part of Ontario. Summer brings the largest number of people to Lion's Head (mostly July and August). This influx of people creates parking problems especially near the beach and marina. The 2018 tourist season was the most crowded yet according to many long time residents. The population drops during the colder seasons. Lion's Head experienced a more significant tornado during the 1985 Barrie tornado outbreak which damaged areas on the outskirts of the village. Since then, no tornadoes have been reported in the area.

It was first described and named by Sir Roderick Murchison from the neighborhood of Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire. In the type area it consists of a series of slaty rocks, shales, calcareous flagstones and sandstones; the calcareous middle portion is sometimes termed the Llandeilo limestone; and in the upper portion volcanic rocks are intercalated.  Features  A remarkable feature in the history of the Llandeilo rocks in Britain, more especially in North Wales and Cumberland, was the outbreak of volcanic action; vast piles of Llandeilo lava and ashes form such hills as Cadair Idris, and the Arenigs in Wales, and Helvellyn and Scafell in Westmorland and Cumberland. The series is also found at Builth and in Pembrokeshire. The average thickness in Wales is about 2000 ft. The group is usually divided in this area into three sub-divisions. In the Corndon district of Shropshire the Middleton Series represents the Llandeilo group; it includes, in descending order, the Rorrington black shales, the Meadowtown limestones and flags, and the western grits and shales. In the Lake District the great volcanic series of Borrowdale, green slates and porphyries, 8000 to ooooft. in thickness, lies on this horizon; and in the Cross Fell area the Milburn beds of the Skiddaw slates (see Arenig) appear to be of the same age. In Scotland the Llandeilo group is represented by the Glenkiln shales, black shales and yellowish mudstones with radiolarian cherts and volcanic tuffs; by the Barr Series, including the Benan conglomerates, Stinchar limestone and Kirkland sandstones; and by the Glenapp conglomerates and Tappinsrnudstones and grits south of Stinchar. Graptolitic shales, similar to those of southern Scotland, are traceable into the north-east of Ireland.  Fossils  The fossils of the Liandeilo group include numerous graptolites, Coenograpus gracilis being taken as the zonal fossil of the upper portion, Didymograptus murchisoni of the lower. Other forms are Climacograptus scharenbergi and Diplograptus foliaceus. Many trilobites are found in these rocks, e.g. Ogygiocarella debuchii, Asaphus tyrannus, Calymene cambrensis, and Cheirurus. Among the brachiopods are Crania, Leptaena, Lingula, and Strophomena. Cardiola and Modiolopsis occur among the pelecypods; Euomphalus, Bellerophon, Murchisonia among the gastropods; and Conularia and Hyolithes among the pteropods. The cephalopods are represented by Orthoceras and Cyrtoceras.  Quarrying  The green roofing slates and plumbago (graphite) of the Lake District are obtained from this group of rocks.

He studied at Pomona College, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in History in 1920. He then pursued an MA in History at The University of Chicago. In spring 1922, he enrolled at Harvard University for a History PhD; there he assisted Charles Haskins. However, a year later, he left the United States for Germany, and completed his doctorate in History at Berlin University. In 1924, he became professor of International History at Peking University and later joined the Academia Sinica, working in the Institute of Social Science Research. Chen was recruited to the Comintern in 1924, by Li Dazhao, as mentioned in his 1988 autobiography My Life During Four Eras. During the 1930s he came down on the Communist side of Mao Zedong, drawing on his field research on the economic conditions of Chinese peasantry for the Institute for Social Science Research. He wrote Landlord and Peasant in China (1936) on this area. He was one of Mao's political theorists, and he spent time out of China in Moscow. Chen was a member of the well-known Richard Sorge spy ring, initially based in Shanghai. When Sorge was reassigned to Tokyo, Chen went along and worked closely with Ozaki Hozumi and others of the ring until 1935, when the unexpected arrest of a messenger from Moscow almost exposed Chen‚Äôs real identity. Chen sensed the danger and fled to Moscow.Maochen Yu, \\"Chen Hansheng's Memoirs and Chinese Communist Espionage ,\\" Cold War International History Project Bulletin, 6-7 (Winter 1995/1996), p. 274 After Chen fled from Tokyo to Moscow in 1935, Owen Lattimore, then the editor of the New York-based journal \\"Pacific Affairs\\", of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR), asked the Soviet Union, a member nation of IPR, for an assistant. Moscow recommended Chen Hansheng to Lattimore, who accepted. Chen then went to New York, and worked with Lattimore from 1936 until 1939, when he was reassigned by Communist intelligence chief Kang Sheng to Hong Kong. Chen stated in his memoirs that Lattimore was kept in the dark as to his true identity as a Communist agent, and that Lattimore‚Äôs scholarly and publishing activities were only to be used as a cover for Chen.Maochen Yu, \\"Chen Hansheng's Memoirs and Chinese Communist Espionage ,\\" Cold War International History Project Bulletin, 6-7 (Winter 1995/1996), p. 274 At Hong Kong, Chen was responsible for running a network of dummy corporations funnelling huge amounts of money to the war effort of the Communist Party, mostly for the purpose of purchasing Japanese-made weapons from the Chinese collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime, whose military forces were rife with corruption and thoroughly demoralized. In 1943 Chen moved to Guilin.

As a member of the Lord‚Äôs ground staff, he was also after J.T. Hearne the most important bowler for MCC and Ground, who in those days played quite a number of first-class matches. A right arm bowler of slow to medium pace, Walter Mead always maintained an excellent length and could spin back to deadly effect whenever wickets were affected by rain. He could vary his stock off break with a ball that turned the other way, but he lacked the deceptive flight that enabled such bowlers as Blythe, Dennett or J.C. White to do well on firm pitches. He rarely did much as a batsman, but when sent in as night-watchman against Leicestershire in 1902 he surprised the crowd so much by making 119 that there was a special collection for him as a reward. Even before Essex had been elevated to first-class status, Walter Mead already had a reputation as a bowler of class. Against the touring Australian in 1893 he took seventeen wickets, but the following year when Essex became first-class he was disappointing on pitches that should have helped him, taking only 41 wickets in eight inter-county matches for 21 each. In 1895, however, after a slow start, he became deadly when wickets became sticky during the middle of July. For the whole summer Mead obtained a record of 179 wickets for less than fifteen runs apiece, and his 17 for 119 against Hampshire is the second best bowling for a losing side in first-class cricket, behind William Mycroft in 1876 (also against Hampshire). Only Tich Freeman has since taken seventeen wickets twice in matches of comparable importance. 1896 and 1897, with most pitches unfavourable to him due to dry weather, were disappointing, but Mead gradually rebounded in the following years. An excellent performance against the Australians in 1899 saw Mead chosen for his only Test match at Lord's, but he was harmless on the hard pitch. He remained close to the top of the first- class averages for every season from 1899 to 1903 ‚Äì though in 1901 he was helped by some very bad Lord's wickets when playing for the MCC ‚Äì and in the last-named year was chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden after heading the first-class bowling averages with best match figures of twelve for 76 against Surrey at the Oval and fifteen for 115 against Leicestershire at Leyton. However, over the 1903/1904 winter Walter Mead's career with Essex terminated temporarily as a result of a dispute over winter pay. They missed him badly in 1904 and 1905, and by 1906 he had agreed to return to the eleven. Considering the remarkable dryness of the 1906 summer in the Home Counties, he bowled very well, and in 1907 he was almost as difficult as ever on the soft pitches. In 1908, however, Walter Mead declined so badly, taking only 48 County Championship wickets, that it was clear his best days were over. Despite a minor revival in 1910 and 1911, when Mead failed to make the most of continuous soft wickets in 1912 it was clear his career was over, so that he dropped out of the eleven before 1913 ended despite Essex having no spin bowler to replace him. Mead left the Lord's ground staff in 1918. His son, Harold, also played some first-class cricket for Essex, although he died in 1921 after never fully recovering from wounds he sustained during World War I. Mead died at the age of eighty-five in 1954.

He is commonly called Talhae Isageum, isageum being the royal title in early Silla. Also known by his personal name as Seok Tal-hae (ÊòîËÑ´Ëß£). He was portrayed by Lee Pil-mo in the 2010 MBC TV series Kim Su-ro, The Iron King.  Background  He was a member of the Gyeongju Seok clan, one of the noble clans that shared the Silla throne during the early Common Era. He was born in a small kingdom 1000 li northeast of Wa (Japan).‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò Âç∑Á¨¨‰∏Ä Êñ∞ÁæÖÊú¨Á¥ÄÁ¨¨‰∏Ä ËÑ±Ëß£Â∞ºÂ∏´‰ªä, ËÑ±Ëß£Êú¨Â§öÂ©ÜÈÇ£ÂúãÊâÄÁîü‰πü ÂÖ∂ÂúãÂú®ÂÄ≠ÂúãÊù±Âåó‰∏ÄÂçÉÈáå (The name of the kingdom is Dapana-guk Îã§ÌååÎÇòÍµ≠ Â§öÂ©ÜÈÇ£Âúã \\"Dapana Country\\" according to Samguk Sagi, or Ryongseong-guk Î£°ÏÑ±Íµ≠ ÈæçÂüéÂúã \\"Dragon Castle/City Country,\\" Jeongmyeong-guk Ê≠£ÊòéÂúã \\"Proper and Enlightened Country,\\" Wanha-guk ÁêìÂ§èÂúã \\"(A Kind of) Jade Summer Country,\\" or Hwaha-guk Ëä±Âé¶Âúã \\"Flower Mansion Country\\"‰∏âÂúãÈÅ∫‰∫ã Á¥ÄÁï∞ Âç∑Á¨¨‰∏Ä ËÑ±Ëß£Áéã, ÊàëÊú¨ÈæçÂüéÂúã‰∫∫ ‰∫¶‰∫ëÊ≠£ÊòéÂúã Êàñ‰∫ëÁêìÂ§èÂúã ÁêìÂ§èÊàñ‰ΩúËä±Âé¶Âúã ÈæçÂüéÂú®ÂÄ≠Êù±Âåó‰∏ÄÂçÉÈáå according to Samguk Yusa.) His father, King Hamdalpa, was a king of this kingdom; his mother was a queen or princess of another kingdom, called Nyeo-guk Â•≥ÂõΩ \\"Woman Country.\\" According to the Samguk Sagi, when he was born as an egg, his father considered it an ill omen and had it boxed and floated at sea. The egg floated past Geumgwan Gaya and landed east of Gyerim (near today's Gyeongju, South Korea), where he was raised by an old man as a fisherman. His family is said to have taken over a high official's house by claiming to be metalsmiths. His birth year is unknown, but he was probably an old man when he assumed the throne, having married the daughter (or younger sister) of King Namhae of Silla in the year AD 8. He was offered the throne as successor to the second king Namhae, but the older Yuri served as king first. Yuri in turn designated Tal-hae his successor. Hogong is chief retainer who served for establishment of Silla. He also founded Kim Alji who is the founder of Kim clan in Korea. He got involved to three royals who are founder of Silla. He has Japanese origin. Tal-hae also came over by ship. The location of his birth place Dapana Country is estimated as somewhere in the Japanese archipelago. It is precisely estimated some part in Sea of Japan side or Kyushu. According to Kenichi Kamigaito, as it is a myth, other lines would be mixed, but Tal-hae of Silla was a King of Tanba province and he made jade there. He reached Silla by following a trade route. Even though excluding details of myth, it can be assumed that clan Seok had trade with Japan. On the other hand, there is a view that Ryongseong-guk () listed in Samguk yusa has been regarded as a nation of Ainu, and Tal-hae has been regarded as a citizen of Ainu.  Reign  In 64, the rival Korean kingdom Baekje attacked several times. Silla battled the Gaya confederacy in 77. According to legend, in 65 the infant Kim Alji, ancestor of the Gyeongju Kim family, was found by Hogong in a golden box in the royal Gyerim forest. Tal-hae named his kingdom Gyerim at this time (the name Silla was officially adopted much later). A tomb believed to be Tal-hae's is located in northern Gyeongju City. The Gyeongju National Museum is constructed on the site where Tal-hae had a palace built. In popular culture *Portrayed by Lee Pil-mo in the 2010 MBC TV series Kim Su-ro, The Iron King.

Young was a left-arm medium-pace bowler and a capable lower-order batsman. His bowling achieved considerable turn off the wicket, and was described in Wisden as having \\"a deceptive curl\\". Young's cricketing successes in minor matches led Essex to buy him out of the Royal Navy. He played a few games in 1898, but came to prominence early the following year, when he took eleven wickets for 74 runs against a powerful Australian touring side and gave Essex a surprising victory by 126 runs. The Times, describing his bowling in the second innings when he took seven for 32, said \\"Young's bowling could not be played\\", that he \\"came off the pitch at a great pace\\" and \\"turned six inches with his arm\\".The Times, 15 May 1899. He continued to bowl so well in a very dry summer of prolific run scoring that by July he was regarded by some as \\"the best hard wicket bowler at England's disposal\\".The Times, 10 July 1899, Gentlemen v Players Sailor Young was picked for two Test matches that season and took six wickets in each of them, finishing at the top of the England averages. However, as a result of him losing form somewhat after bowling the Players to victory at The Oval, Sailor Young was discarded for the last match of the series and never played Test cricket again. He still took 139 wickets for the year, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker. Young's success in 1899 led to great expectations for him, but after an excellent performance for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Yorkshire early in the year \\"Sailor\\" surprisingly fell off to such an extent that for Essex in county matches he took only forty-three wickets as against eighty-nine. After improving a little in 1901 and doing an impressive performance on a soft pitch against Kent early in 1902 \\"Sailor\\" nevertheless fell off completely. By 1903 his wicket tally was down to just 52 and after that season he dropped out of regular cricket because of severe rheumatism in his muscles. Sailor Young continued to play a few matches for Essex and as a member of the MCC ground staff right up to 1912, but could never undertake anything more than very short bowling spells. In 1910-11 he was a member of the MCC team that toured the West Indies. From 1921 to 1931, Young was a first-class umpire and he officiated in two Test matches in 1924 and 1926.

Len Braund was an all-rounder, a versatile batsman who could defend or attack according to the needs of the game and a leg break bowler who used variation more than accuracy to take wickets. He was also regarded by contemporaries as the best slip fielder of his time. Braund played 21 times from 1896 for Surrey before joining Somerset, where he had to qualify for County Championship games by residence. On his Somerset debut, he hit 82 against the 1899 Australians. The following year, he made his Championship debut for Somerset against Middlesex at Lord's, in Andrew Stoddart's last match; but this was also Braund's last match of the season for Somerset, as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) ruled that he was not properly qualified. To fill in the waiting, he played for W. G. Grace's London County side. Braund's proper career starts from 1901, and in his first full season he scored more than 1,000 runs and took over 100 wickets. He scored 107 in a remarkable match at Headingley when Somerset, 238 behind Yorkshire on the first innings, put up 630 in the second innings and won the match by 279 runs, Braund taking four wickets as the home team collapsed to 113 all out in the second innings. It was Yorkshire's only defeat of the season, and Somerset repeated that feat in 1902, a closer match won by just 34 runs in which Braund took 15 wickets for 71 runs, including a career-best nine for 41 in the second innings. In between these two county matches, Braund had become a Test cricketer, selected for the 1901‚Äì02 England tour of Australia. He was an instant success in Tests, scoring 58 in his first Test innings and taking seven wickets, including five for 61 in the second innings, as England beat Australia by an innings at Sydney. In the third Test, at Adelaide, he scored an unbeaten 103, and in the series as a whole he led the England team by taking 21 wickets. Named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1902, Braund played all five matches in The Ashes series that season and was involved in many of the crucial incidents in a very close contest. He caught Clem Hill at Edgbaston off George Herbert Hirst by running from slip round to the leg side. Gilbert Jessop described it as ‚Äúquite the most brilliant anticipatory effort that I have yet seen‚Äù. Australia were all out for 36, their lowest Test total. At Old Trafford, he came in with England at 44 for five wickets and scored 65, putting on 141 with Stanley Jackson; in the same match, he was the bowler off whom Fred Tate missed a skied catch from Joe Darling that enabled Australia to win by three runs. Braund's second tour to Australia in 1903‚Äì04 was also successful. He scored 102 at Sydney while R. E. Foster was scoring his then-record 287, and he took eight wickets for 81 runs in the first innings of the final Test at Melbourne. His third visit to Australia in 1907‚Äì08 was less of a success, but in between he had scored a third Test century, making 104 against the 1907 South African team that included the sensational googly bowlers who had brought South Africa its first Test victories over England in 1905‚Äì06. In all, he played 23 Tests, scoring 987 runs and taking 47 wickets. In first-class cricket, Braund did the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in the season three times, in 1901, 1902, and 1903, and in a career that lasted until 1920 he scored 17,801 runs and took 1,114 wickets. In the later part of his career, he lost the ability to spin the ball and became very expensive; by 1910, he played for Somerset largely as a batsman. He took 546 catches in his career. After retiring, Braund coached at Cambridge University and was a first-class umpire for 18 seasons to 1938, standing in three Test matches between 1926 and 1929.

The Robert Burns statue is visible in front of the cathedral. The Octagon is the city centre of Dunedin, in the South Island of New Zealand. It is an eight-sided plaza with a circular one- way carriageway, bisected by the city's main street, and is also the central terminus of two other main thoroughfares. The Octagon is predominantly a pedestrian reserve, with grass and paved features, and is surmounted by a statue of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Several of Dunedin's significant buildings and institutions adjoin the plaza, which is also a major hub for public transport in Dunedin. First laid out in 1846, the site was largely derelict for many years until the two major early parts of the city's settlement (to the north and south of the Octagon) were linked by the excavation of Bell Hill. From the 1890s on it rose to prominence as the city's central area. The Octagon was substantially renovated during the 1980s, and is now a centre of the city's cafe culture, with many al fresco dining areas. New Year's Eve celebrations are held annually in The Octagon. Geography Central Dunedin. The Octagon is the small octagonal area marked in red (numbered 2) The Octagon is an eight-sided plaza bisected by the city's main street, which is called George Street to the northeast and Princes Street to the southwest. These form the axis of Dunedin's central business district. Two other main thoroughfares terminate at the Octagon: Upper and Lower Stuart Streets. Lower Stuart Street is the shorter of the two, leading 600 metres southeast to Dunedin Railway Station and to State Highway 1, which passes through central Dunedin as two parallel one-way streets. Upper Stuart Street climbs steeply to the northwest as a major arterial route to the city's inner hill suburbs and beyond towards Three Mile Hill, one of the routes to the Taieri Plains and South Otago. Surrounding the Octagon is a larger octagonal street, Moray Place. The Octagon is a major hub for public transport in Dunedin; the bus stops are actually mostly on approaching streets with one main stop in the southwestern quadrant, outside Reading cinema. In 2018, a new bus hub was created close to the corner of Moray Place and Great King Street (one block to the east of George Street), which reduced some of the bus traffic through the Octagon. Taxi stands occupy much of the northeastern quadrant. Features statue of poet Robert Burns has pride of place in the upper Octagon. Several of Dunedin's significant buildings and institutions face this plaza or closely adjoin it of which three have New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) recognition. The Dunedin Municipal Chambers (Dunedin Town Hall), Civic Centre and Public Library lie in the Octagon's northwestern quadrant, between George Street and Upper Stuart Street, as does St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral, which is separated from the municipal buildings by the narrow Harrop Lane. Both the Municipal Chambers and cathedral are listed as Category I buildings by the NZHPT. The Octagon's southwestern quadrant contains Dunedin Public Art Gallery, which sits on the former site of the D.I.C. building on the corner of Princes Street, a multiplex cinema, and a major office block, Forsyth Barr House. The southeastern quadrant contains the Regent Theatre (Dunedin's largest live theatre) and the Athenaeum and Mechanics' Institute, which was until recently used as a private lending library. The Athenaeum building is being converted into an arts hub containing galleries and studios. Both of these structures also have Category I NZHPT ratings. Several cafes and bars complete this quadrant, and similar businesses also make up much of the Octagon's northeastern quadrant, along with a second office block, Burns House. Many of the Octagon's bars and cafes have provision for al fresco dining, making the Octagon a lively place. The area within the roadway ‚Äî with the exception of the central thoroughfare between George and Princes Streets ‚Äî is a pedestrian reserve, grassed and terraced in the upper half, and paved in the lower. A street market occupies much of the paved area once a week. The paved area contains both water features and a giant chessboard. Both it and the grassed area in the upper octagon are frequently the venues for open-air meetings and entertainment. The terrace is surmounted by an 1887 statue by Sir John Steell of the Scottish poet Robert Burns, which has a Category I listing in the NZHPT register. The poet's nephew, Thomas Burns, was one of the founders of the city. The statue stands on the McMillan Terrace, a vantage point over the Octagon, which was presented to the city by philanthropist Alexander McMillan in 1967.\\"Other memorials\\", Dunedin City Council website. Retrieved 7 October 2013. History A De Havilland DH86 Express flies over central Dunedin during the 1930s. In this picture, looking west, The Octagon is the clear circular area just below the centre of the photo. The Octagon was first laid out during Charles Kettle's surveying of the city in 1846. His plans for the centre of Dunedin included a large Octagonal area (Moray Place) enclosing a smaller octagonal space, originally designated as a reserve. This status was embodied in law in 1854, six years after the arrival of the first European settlers to the city. At this stage in Dunedin's history the area was officially designated as \\"the Square of Moray Place\\", though it was colloquially known as the Octagon even then.\\"\\" Despite the reserve status, the Anglican Church sought to build in the centre of the Octagon, applying directly to Governor Sir George Grey. It was not until construction was about to begin that the local (predominantly Presbyterian) community became aware of what was happening. This resulted in a major furore. Otago Superintendent William Cargill was put in charge of resolving the dispute, which resulted in the Anglicans being forced to withdraw their plans for The Octagon. (The Anglican St. Paul's Cathedral stands today at its northern edge.) The 1879 Cafe Chantant fire For many years, the site was somewhat derelict, with little done to improve the condition of the reserve. Early central Dunedin was divided by the body of Bell Hill, which rose immediately to the south of The Octagon. It was only with the making of a cutting through the hill and the later removal of most of it to allow traffic to move easily between the northern and southern parts of the central city along Princes Street that The Octagon began to gain any prominence. Even so, it remained unsightly until the 1890s. The first major structure of any kind in The Octagon's reserve area was a monument erected in 1864 to the memory of Cargill. This was moved several hundred metres to The Exchange in 1872 to allow for the construction of a central roadway connecting Princes Street and George Street. In 1887 a statue of the poet Robert Burns, the uncle of one of the city's founding fathers, was unveiled. It still stands at the western edge of The Octagon close to the junction with Stuart Street. St Paul's Cathedral, Dunedin, August 2006 On 8 September 1879, fire broke out in the Cafe Chantant in the lower Octagon. The cafe had a bad reputation and the proprietor William Waters was under threat of arrest. The building was full at the time of the fire, and escape from the building was difficult. In all, a dozen people died in the blaze, including Robert Wilson, editor of the Otago Witness and his family. Waters was later charged with setting fire to the building for insurance purposes.Octagon building fire, Dunedin - 8 September 1879 The disaster was the biggest single loss of life in New Zealand due to fire until the destruction of Seacliff Mental Hospital some 63 years later. In the early 1890s several improvements were proposed to The Octagon, including fencing, and the planting of plane trees along the edge of the central roadway. About this time a monument was also erected to early settler Thomas Burns, though this monument, erected in 1891, was generally unpopular and was eventually removed during the 1940s. Subterranean public toilets were installed close to the monument in 1910, though these were filled in during the 1970s. In 1963, the council was given ¬£5,000 by the Evening Star newspaper to build a fountain in the Octagon. The Star Fountain, as it became known after its installation in 1966, was a popular attraction, with synchronised lighting, music and water displays, which played at regular times of the morning and evening. Despite its popularity, it was also unsightly during times when it was not playing, due to the large number of visible pipes needed for its performances. When The Octagon was refurbished in the 1990s, the Star Fountain was removed and was not included in The Octagon's new design, leading to some public outcry.\\"The Octagonal Heart,\\" Dunedin Amenities Society, 25 July 2014. Retrieved 15 June 2020. =Renovation= A plaque in Writers' Walk in The Octagon featuring the words of James K. Baxter During the late 1980s, the Dunedin City Council commissioned consultants with a view to substantially renovating The Octagon area. The initial proposals included the closure of several sections of road around and within The Octagon, again resulting in public protest, and in the end the renovations went ahead without any road closures. The \\"new look\\" Octagon was in many ways an \\"old look\\", with covered walkways and Edwardian- style streetlights and fittings giving an antique look to the central city. This was designed to complement the many late Victorian and Edwardian buildings which surround The Octagon. The Improvements also included the paving of a plaza area in the lower Octagon (an area now regularly used for street performances and markets). The renovation of The Octagon, and particularly the addition of a plaza area, has seen an increase in al fresco dining in The Octagon, which is now a major hub for Dunedin's restaurant and cafe culture. Renovation of The Octagon also saw the installation of two walks featuring large plaques embedded in the paving. The larger of these is a \\"Writers' walk\\", featuring plaques inscribed with words from notable Dunedin writers and words about Dunedin by famous visiting writers. This walk extends around much of the upper Octagon. A second, smaller, walk along the central carriageway of The Octagon features plaques dedicated to Dunedin-born or -based Olympic medallists. =Barnes Dance= In March 2018, Barnes Dance crossings were introduced at the Octagon's southwestern and northeastern junctions (with Princes Street and George Street). They became the city's first Barnes Dance crossing for over 20 years (the last previously being at Cargill's Corner in South Dunedin), and the pilot for a scheme which saw several more such crossings put in place by the end of the year.

A nephew of the then-famous batsman William Gunn, John Gunn first played for Nottinghamshire when only twenty. The following year John Gunn scored 107 against the Philadelphians in his third first-class match and took ten wickets against Yorkshire in his fourth. With William Attewell desperately needing support to improve Nottinghamshire's deplorably weak bowling, Gunn was seen as a boon but he but did so little after the Yorkshire game that he could not establish a place in the team. 1898, strangely, was a repeat of the previous year with one bowling performance against Yorkshire overshadowing everything else. 1899, with the decline of Attewell, saw John Gunn establish himself as Nottinghamshire's chief bowler, though he faded late in the season. 1900, however, saw him and Thomas Wass restore Nottinghamshire's bowling to reasonable strength for the first time since the early 1890s. He took eleven wickets for the Players against the Gentlemen at the Oval. He also advanced as a batsman with six scores of over fifty, and the following season, though he never played a bigger innings than 87, scored 1,000 runs for the first time and bowled, considering the unfavourable pitches, exceedingly well. In those days Gunn was a left hand medium pace bowler who relied on the ball that went in from off to leg, which allowed him to nag away at batsmen very well on good pitches but could not break-back on a sticky wicket like Rhodes, Blythe, Briggs or Hargreave. It was because of this that Gunn was chosen for the Ashes tour of 1901/1902 when Yorkshire refused to let Rhodes go ‚Äì apparently because they feared it would affect his performance the following season. The effects of the tour hit hard on Gunn in 1902 and he was very disappointing with both bat and ball apart from a few good bowling performances. The following year, though, bowling in a slower style, he had his finest season ever and was momentarily second as an all-rounder to Hirst. In the process, on a featherbed wicket at Trent Bridge, he hit 294 against Leicestershire, which was amazingly his first century since his third first-class match! As a bowler, Gunn took 28 wickets in two games against Surrey and Essex during the August Bank Holiday week. He was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1904, but the following three years were not quite up to the standard set in 1903 ‚Äì though he bowled wonderfully against Essex in 1905 on a perfect pitch. In 1906 Gunn again changed his style, bowling very slowly and tossing the ball up, with barely improved success. 1907 was a year of quite incredible triumph for Nottinghamshire, but for John Gunn it was an anticlimax. Wass and Hallam accomplished the most amazing run of bowling triumphs in the history of the competition, and Gunn bowled only 281 overs in 17 matches. Only against Essex and the South African touring team did Gunn have to do serious bowling. In batting, too, he was overshadowed by his younger brother George and failed to reach 1,000 runs despite a century against Sussex. Unexpectedly, the lack of practice in 1907 affected his bowling severely when Wass and Hallam failed to repeat their 1907 form in the following two seasons. Indeed, by 1909 John Gunn was clearly no more than an occasional bowler ‚Äì he had taken only 42 wickets for 30 each in 1908 and 1909 ‚Äì besides failing to recover his batting form. In the extremely dry summer of 1911, he was back in form as a batsman, but though called upon to bowl a good deal he was never formidable and always expensive. Nonetheless, his batting remained a major force right up to the early 1920s: he averaged over 40 in 1911, 1913, 1914, 1919 and 1920 and was at times the side's outstanding batsman. After this, time gradually took its toll and Gunn dropped out of the Nottinghamshire side after a few matches in 1925. He did play for Sir Julien Cahn's XI after this time, scoring 139 in one match against Essex in 1930,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/13/13709.html and featuring for the team until at least the age of fifty-six.

Early life and career A supporter, Lewis moved with his family from Swan Hill to Ballarat when he was eight years old, and except for his time at the Swans, he was an itinerant footballer. Lewis played junior football with North Ballarat and made his senior debut with the Roosters in 1988 before spending two summer seasons playing with Darwin club St Mary's, alongside future champion Michael Long. In 1989, Lewis played alongside brother Wes in Torquay‚Äôs premiership side and returned to North Ballarat for the 1990 season. By this time almost every AFL club was aware of his prodigious talents and lined up to secure his services in the mid-season draft. On his 21st birthday Lewis received a call from childhood hero Peter Knights, who inquired whether Lewis was able to play for him at Tasmanian club Devonport. He also received a call from recruiter Shane O'Sullivan who said the Bears wanted to take Lewis as the number one selection at the pre-season draft. Just before the 1990 mid-season draft, Lewis kicked seven goals for North Ballarat in an inter-league game and caught the eye of scouts. He trained with six clubs in the next few weeks before the Swans made him their first pick. While Lewis was keen to play AFL, he wanted to play for a Victorian club. Shortly before getting drafted, he met footballer manager John Reid in Melbourne, who told Lewis that if the Bears did not list him, the Swans would and if he didn‚Äôt like it he could stand out of League football for two years. As it turned out, Brisbane named South Australian Laurence Schache and the Swans, true to their word, took Lewis at number two. Lewis made his AFL debut against at the Western Oval in Round 15 of the 1990 AFL season. He played up on the wing against Leon Cameron, who would also enjoy a long and successful AFL career. Lewis scored a goal with his first kick, courtesy of a handpass from teammate David Murphy. Over his career, Lewis would be used in a range of positions. He even played one game at full-back on ‚Äôs Allen Jakovich. At the time of his arrival, Sydney was a team falling apart in the post- Edelsten era. While Lewis showed flashes of individual brilliance and established himself as a regular senior player, it was usually in a losing team. In 1993, he missed out on the victory against Melbourne that broke a 26-game losing streak due to injury. At the end of 1993, Lewis returned to Melbourne, where his parents ran two hotels, and asked to be traded. But a deal with fell through just before the trading deadline. After football After retiring as a footballer, Lewis began a career in broadcasting. He was a commentator on Australia's Seven Network and appeared on the sports program The Fat. Lewis was also a member of the Talking League team on Australian radio station 2UE. Lewis had a stint as coach of in 2005.

He is regarded as one of Australia's greatest ever rowers figuring in senior representative squads consistently from 1977 to 1996 and representing Australia on eighteen occasions at three Olympics and fifteen World Rowing Championships. He competed at the highest levels as both a sculler and a sweep oarsman, in both lightweight and open divisions, across all boat classes. He won twenty-nine Australian national championship titles in his career. Club and state rowing Born in Melbourne, Victoria, and educated at Xavier College, Antonie's senior rowing was done from the Melbourne University Boat Club. Antonie was a president of the Melbourne University Boat Club. Starting out as sweep rower Antonie was selected in the Victorian state representative lightweight four to race the Penrith Cup at the Australian Rowing Championships for four consecutive years 1977 to 1980. Those crews won the interstate championship in 1977 & 1978.

Tate had the misfortune to drop a crucial swerving lofted pull off the left-handed Australian captain, Joe Darling, the bowler being the leg-spinner Len Braund from the now Brian Statham End: just forward of square leg, in front of the refreshment stall (the bowler's testimony, and photos locate the structure), slightly in from the boundary, rail/tram-line side of the ground. England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings with eight wanted for victory. Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him. The patch of turf on which Tate dropped the catch is now in the pavilion lawn at Whalley Range Cricket Club, after Old Trafford lifted its playing area in August 2008, as is that where Clem Hill took his famous running catch in front of the pavilion in the same game. The England captain, Archie MacLaren, was born in Whalley Range and grew up there. His first-class career with Sussex lasted from 1887 to 1905. Bowling off-spin at a brisk pace, he took 1331 first-class wickets at 21.55, with best innings figures of 9-73. After his playing career had ended, he became the coach at Derbyshire. One of Tate's sons, Maurice, also played Test cricket. Another, Cecil Tate, played first-class cricket. After his cricket career, Tate ran a pub in Derby until 1937. He died in poverty in 1943.

Known in the West as Georg Rumer, he was a close friend of Lev Landau, and was arrested with him during the Great Purge in 1938. Biography Rumer in 1915‚Äì17 Mugshot of Rumer from 1938 Grave of Rumer and his second wife at the Cherbuzinskoye cemetery in Novosibirsk Rumer was born in Moscow into a Jewish merchant family. His elder brothers Osip and Isidor were well-known translators and philosophers. After graduating from non- classical secondary school in 1917, in 1918 Rumer entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow State University and graduated in 1924. In 1927 he married Lyudmila Zalkind, his girlfriend of nine years, and emigrated with her to Oldenburg, Germany, where he enrolled to study construction engineering. The same year he abandoned this boring for him topic in favor of theoretical physics, and moved to G√∂ttingen. During an internship at the University of G√∂ttingen he worked as an assistant of Max Born. He collaborated with Walter Heitler and published several theoretical works on the structure of molecules. Rumer returned to Moscow in May 1932, as persecution of Jews in Germany became a real threat to him and his wife. He became an associate professor at the Faculty of Physics of Moscow State University (MSU) and assumed a professor position in January 1933. He was recommended for this position by Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Leonid Mandelstam. At MSU Rumer supervised several notable scientists, including Mikhail Volkenshtein. He lectured at MSU from 1932 to 1937 and worked as a scientist at the Lebedev Physical Institute from 1935 to 1938. In 1935 he defended his habilitation, and in 1937 started working with Lev Landau; very soon they became close friends. Rumer was arrested on the Arbat Street in April 1938 as an accomplice of the \\"public enemy\\", Landau, when he was going to a birthday party. One of his brothers was jailed earlier on an unrelated case as part of Stalin's purges. Landau was arrested too, but released after one year owing to the extraordinary efforts of Pyotr Kapitsa. While in jail Rumer first worked on plane flutter and wobble problems in a sharashka situated at an Omsk suburb. Later in 1946 he was transferred to Taganrog. There he worked on a project of a new transport aircraft, which was headed by Robert Bartini. After serving full 10 years of his sentence, Rumer was exiled to Yeniseysk. There he worked at a teachers' training college as a professor of physics and mathematics. Rumer moved to Novosibirsk in 1950, where he made both ends meet owing to casual earnings for two years. He could not get a job at universities and research institutions because of his convict status. When his exile term ended, he was accepted for a senior staff scientist at the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In the end of 1954 he was informed by the Military Board of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union that his case was reconsidered and the sentence was waived due to the newly discovered evidence. Rumer lectured at the Novosibirsk teachers' training institute, held a position of the head of the Theoretical Physics Department at the East-Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR from 1953 to 1957. In 1957 he was appointed the director of the Radio Physics and Radio Electronics Institute which was the first physical institute in Novosibirsk. The institute was merged with the Semiconductor Physics Institute in 1964. Rumer worked at the Sobolev Institute of Mathematics for some time and later at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. He carried out educational work at Novosibirsk State University for almost 20 years and retired in 1972. Rumer died on 1 February 1985 in Akademgorodok, he was buried at the Yuzhnoye Cemetery. The scientist was survived by his second wife Olga Mikhailova (1921‚Äì2011), son Mikhail Mikhailov and daughter Tatyana Mikhailova. Rumer and Mikhailova met in 1946 while working together in Taganrog, and married soon after that. Both of their children became scientists. Works * G. Rumer, E. Teller and H.

The conference lasted from 4 to 18 December 1655. While Cromwell himself was in favour of Jewish resettlement, the participants ultimately broke down into three groups. The London merchants opposed resettlement due to fears of economic competition, while the clergymen were not in favour on religious grounds. The second group, consisting mainly of Cromwell's officials and military figures, backed readmission with certain precautions built in. They were in favour of giving Jews a probationary period during which they could be expelled if they misbehaved. They were expected not to blaspheme Christ or attempt to convert Christians. The third group consisted of the Millenarians and Sabbatarians, both of whom broke down into radical and more conservative wings. The conservative wing of this faction supported readmission with clauses built in that would make it possible for Jews to be thrown out if things did not go as planned. The radical wing argued that it was England's divine duty to readmit Jews, or else face God's wrath. Most members of this third faction hoped to convert Jews to Christianity upon their arrival in England, thereby hastening the second coming and the advent of the messianic age. While the conference failed to reach a definitive conclusion as to whether Jewish readmission should be carried out, it was significant for clarifying that resettlement was legally permissible. Most prominent legal scholars agreed that \\"there is no law against their (the Jews) coming\\". This was correct, as Jews had been expelled from England by the Edict of Expulsion in 1290 on the basis of a royal decree, not on the basis of parliamentary legislation. This finding would prove crucial to the eventual readmission of Jews in the 1660s.

Life and family  Born in Brockville, Canada West (now Ontario), to a family of United Empire Loyalist stock, he was the youngest son of Hiram Fulford and Martha Harris. In 1880, Fulford married Mary Wilder White (1856‚Äì1946), a socialite from Wisconsin, and had three children. Dorothy Marston (1881‚Äì1949), their eldest, married Arthur Charles Hardy, son of former Ontario Premier Arthur Sturgis Hardy, in 1901 in a ceremony at Fulford Place, the family estate. Martha Harris (1883‚Äì1910) died young, while giving birth. The long-awaited male heir arrived much later and after one near-fatal miscarriage, when Mary Fulford was 46 years of age. George Taylor II (1902‚Äì1987) was a politician himself (Member of the House of Commons of Canada)Parliamentarian File: FULFORD, George Taylor (Jr.), Library of Parliament (Canada) and owned Fulford Place until his death. Fulford went to business college in Belleville, Ontario, and apprenticed with his brother, William, who was a dispensing chemist in Brockville. He took over his brother‚Äôs modest apothecary in 1874 and eventually built on it to form a successful patent medicine company.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online He was elected to the town council in 1879 and served as an alderman for 12 terms. He was involved with the Liberal Party of Canada and became a friend of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He was appointed to the Canadian Senate in 1900 representing the senatorial division of Brockville, Ontario. He served until his death in 1905. George Taylor Fulford is reported to be the first Canadian fatal automobile accident victim on record. On October 8, 1905, he was riding in a chauffeured open roadster in Newton, Massachusetts with his business partner Willis T. Hanson, of Schenectady, N.Y., when it slammed into the side of a streetcar while crossing a blind intersection. Fulford died seven days later, at age fifty-three. His widow never remarried. ( W.T. Hanson, not critically injured, assumed management of the Canadian and foreign business of the Dr. Williams Co., in addition to his own U.S. franchise. The chauffeur died of head trauma October 11.) Fulford was a philanthropist, giving considerable donations to institutions such as the Brockville Rowing Club, the Wall Street Methodist Church, the Brockville General Hospital, and the YMCA; in his will, he left a large sum of money to establish a home for indigent women.  Business  In January 1887, Fulford registered G. T. Fulford & Co. in the Leeds County Registrar, as a vendor and manufacturer of patent medicines. In 1890, a local McGill-trained physician, Dr. William Jackson, sold him the rights to Pink Pills for Pale People for $53.01. This patent medicine would make him a millionaire. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People were marketed in 87 countries worldwide, including Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, South Africa, Singapore, Australia and China. Fulford was an innovative advertiser. He relied heavily on testimonials, submitted by customers, of miraculous recoveries. He would have these printed in newspapers in a way that it was difficult to differentiate news articles from the advertisements, so readers would see headlines proclaiming these miraculous recoveries, and read on to learn that they were saved by Pink Pills. By 1900, he was spending ¬£200,000 yearly in Britain alone on advertising. Dr William‚Äôs Pink Pills for Pale People were sold in Canada for fifty cents per box, or $2.50 for six boxes. Essentially, they were an iron supplement, containing mostly sugar, starch and an iron sulphate. Due to the prevalence of anaemia at this time, the iron-based pills worked as a blood booster for many, thus perpetuating the pill's reputation as a cure-all. After Fulford‚Äôs death, G. T. Fulford & Co. was managed by different associates, and went into receivership in 1989. Fulford Place Fulford Place In 1898, Fulford commissioned an estate, known as Fulford Place, to be built on the King‚Äôs Highway, on the eastern edge of Brockville. Designed by architect A.W. Fuller from Albany, New York, Fulford Place was decorated primarily in Beaux-Arts style. It was finished in 1901, and had 35 rooms making up 20,000 square feet. Due to Fulford's role as a politician and businessman, entertaining was one of the primary functions of Fulford Place. Features of the house include a grand hall, a dining room to seat over fifty guests, a spacious verandah, a rococo- style drawing room for the ladies and a Moorish-style smoking room for the gentlemen. The grounds at Fulford Place were designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and the recently restored formal Italianate garden is a rare example of a privately owned Olmsted-designed garden. Fulford Place The property was reduced to three of its original due to a decline in the family's fortunes in the 1960s. George Taylor Fulford II remained proprietor of Fulford Place until his death, when he bequeathed the estate to the Ontario Heritage Foundation (now Ontario Heritage Trust). All of its original contents were later donated by his widow and his son, George Taylor Fulford III. The property has since been restored, and was opened to the public as a house museum in 1993. It has been interpreted to showcase the Edwardian style of the Fulfords' time using early photographs of rooms (taken for insurance purposes) and a collection of original artifacts. The mansion has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.Ontario Heritage Trust - Fulford Place (Brockville) Magedoma In 1904, Fulford bought a long steam-powered yacht. Originally named The Cangarda, he rechristened it The Magedoma Cangarda - Classic Steam Yacht Restoration - Power & Motoryacht - Cangarda - A Classic Steam Yacht after his family (MAry, GEorge, DOrothy, MArtha). Among guests entertained on the yacht were several Canadian Prime Ministers, as well as the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Kent, and the British Prime Minister in 1927.Mary Fulford (1856-1946) - Mackenzie King - Exhibitions - Library and Archives Canada The Fulfords lent the Magedoma to the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II as a training vessel in the St. Lawrence. It was returned to them in 1947 heavily damaged, and with $13,000 in lieu of repairs. The yacht was sold shortly thereafter, and has since changed hands several times. Today it has been restored, and resides in the Boston harbor. Magedoma Drive, a street in Brockville, was named after the yacht.  G. T.

These are the medications to which people should have access at all times in sufficient amounts. The prices should be at generally affordable levels. Since 1977, the WHO has published a model list of essential medicines, with the current (2019) list for adult patients containing over 400 medicines. Since 2007, a separate list of medicines intended for child patients has been published. Both the WHO adult and children's lists contain a notation indicating that a particular medication is \\"complementary\\", thus essentially there are two lists, the \\"core list\\" and the \\"complementary list\\". The core list presents a list of minimum medicine needs for a basic health care system, listing the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions. Priority conditions are selected on the basis of current and estimated future public health relevance, and potential for safe and cost- effective treatment. The complementary list presents essential medicines for priority diseases, for which specialized diagnostic or monitoring facilities are needed. In case of doubt medicines may also be listed as complementary on the basis of higher costs or less attractive cost-effectiveness in a variety of settings. The list is important because it forms the basis of national drugs policy in more than 155 countries, both in the developed and developing world. Many governments refer to WHO recommendations when making decisions on health spending. Countries are encouraged to prepare their own lists taking into consideration local priorities. Over 150 countries have published an official essential medicines list. Theory and practice The definition of essential medicines has changed over time. The original WHO definition in 1977 was that they were medicines \\"of utmost importance, basic, indispensable, and necessary for the healthcare needs of the population\\". The concept was mentioned in one of the ten points of the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration on primary health care. In 2002 definition was changed to: > Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of > the population. And this remains the definition . =Selection= Items are chosen as essential medicines based on how common the disease is that is being treated, evidence of benefit, the degree of side effects and the cost compared to other options. =Cost-to-benefit ratio= Cost effectiveness is the subject of debate between producers (pharmaceutical companies) and purchasers of drugs (national health services). It is estimated that access to essential medicines could save 10 million people a year. History The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines has been updated every two years since 1977. The 21st version was published in April 2019. =Children's list= The first edition of the \\"WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children\\", was published in 2007, while the 7th edition was published in 2019. It was created to make sure that the needs of children were systematically considered such as availability of proper formulations. The first edition contained 450 formulations of 200 different medications. =Number of medications= The number of medications has nearly doubled, from the original 208 in 1977, to more than 340. The range has increased over the years and now includes an antimigraine drug, antidotes, and antineoplastic drugs. The third list for children from 2011, contains 269 medications. Society and culture Access to essential medicines are part of the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically goal 3.8. A number of organizations, which are global in scope, use the list to determine which medications they will supply.

On August 28, 1932, Walter and Gladys Hill of Fort McMurray were advised by their doctor to seek specialized medical care at a hospital in Edmonton due to complications with Gladys' pregnancy. The couple were flown to the Cooking Lake Airport in a Fokker Universal G-CAHJ, and a healthy boy was born 10 minutes after landing. In 1953, Max Ward took delivery of a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter single- engine aircraft at the Cooking Lake Airport and founded Wardair. The U.S. Army established a base at the Cooking Lake Airport in 1942. The purpose of the base was to support construction of the Canol pipeline connecting Norman Wells to Whitehorse, Yukon. The project was considered a high priority due to the potential threat of a Japanese invasion of the Aleutian Islands. The Americans purchased a number of Norduyn Norseman aircraft (named the C-64) to ferry personnel and supplies to the extremely rugged northern wilderness where the pipeline was being constructed. The American operating base was wound down in 1945 as the war came to a close, but the Americans left behind upgraded docks and seawall for use at the airport. The Cooking Lake Airport lodge hosted the cast and crew of the 1961 film Wings of Chance, one of the first full-length Hollywood motion pictures shot in Canada. The film stars James Brown, Frances Rafferty, Richard Tretter, and Patrick Whyte. While many of the scenes for the film were shot at the Cooking Lake Airport its most memorable scenes were shot in nearby national parks. Cooking Lake Airport gained approval in 2015 for private and corporate international flights from the United States under Canada's Border Agency CANPASS Program. In 2016, the airport served approximately 26,000 aircraft movements, the same number of aircraft movements as the Lethbridge Airport. There are approximately 200 aircraft based at Cooking Lake Airport.  Economic Impact  The airport generates $9.85 million of economic value to the region each year. There are approximately 33 direct jobs spread across various small aviation businesses on the field. Two Transport Canada approved Flight Training schools operate at the airport and graduate 60-75 licensed pilots each year. In addition to typical private and commercial flight training, Cooking Lake Aviation offers a diploma in Aviation Management while Freedom Air provides flight training to paraplegic students. There are five aircraft maintenance shops located on the airport.  Property tax controversy  Excessive property taxes at the Cooking Lake Airport have been the subject of numerous appeals by airport volunteers. In 2015, an independent assessment review board acknowledged that the property taxes at the Cooking Lake Airport were inequitable with the nearby County-owned Edmonton/Josephburg Aerodrome, but attributed the inequity to the Warren Thomas Aerodrome being eligible for certain tax exemptions pursuant to s.362(1)(o)(ii) of the Municipal Government Act.Notice of Decision, CARB 0302-04/2015, Composite Assessment Review Board.

It had a population of 7,741 in the .  Location  The village has grown considerably in recent years and remains popular with beach-goers, sea-changers, and holiday-makers. Lennox (as it is frequently called) was once separated from Ballina by some distance, the northern encroach of Ballina and the southern advancement of Lennox Head have meant that little now separates them. = Geology = The headland was created in the Cenozoic Era as part of one of the lava flows from the Tweed Volcano, a Shield Volcano, centred on what is now Mt Warning. The basaltic lava spread south and east from the volcano in a succession of flows which covered to varying depths an older landform uplifted from the ocean bed in the Mesozoic Era.  Significant events  In 1957, a major bushfire which had burned for several days in swamp behind Lennox Head changed direction and swept through the town. Local residents had some warning and sheltered in the space between the lake and the ocean. No houses were lost. On 3 June 2010, the village was hit by a small Tornado, which severely damaged thirty homes, a number of people were injured and seven vans overturned at the Lake Ainsworth Caravan Park. In January 2014, a major bushfire broke out just north of the town, igniting heathland all the way north to Suffolk Park. The blaze was started by a lightning strike and continued for another month due to underground peat fires.  Population  According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,741 people in the Lennox Head - Skennars Head area. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.9% of the population. * 82.0% of people were born in Australia. The most next common countries of birth were England 4.1% and New Zealand 1.8%. * 91.0% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.8%, Catholic 25.1% and Anglican 16.0%.  Tourism  The headland, also known as Lennox Point, is used by surfers, who come for the noted righthand break. Hang-gliders too visit the headland to launch off its 65m cliff. The point is also used for watching dolphins surfing and the annual whale migration. The Pat Morton lookout (at the headland) has views of the village and of Seven Mile Beach extending up towards Broken Head. The town is known for its pub, caravan park, as well as Lake Ainsworth, a freshwater lake that has distinctive tannin- stained waters from the surrounding tea trees and is in contrast with the white sands of Seven Mile Beach. Over the warmer summer months the lake is subject to blue green algae bloom. Also located in the village is a Bora ring of some significance to the local Bundjalung Tribe. Lennox Head markets are held on the second and fifth Sunday of the month, at the community centre The town also has a small primary school (Lennox Head Public School). Sport and recreation Lennox Head Dolphins is a rugby league club that competes in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League competition. Lennox Head Rugby Union Club is a rugby union club that competes in the Far North Coast Rugby zone. The club, known as The Trojans was established in 1999. Their home ground is Williams Reserve, Lennox Head.

It has a population of around 171,200, which is a multi-ethnic society. The city lies on the Afghan Ring Road, 69 km from Kabul along the route to the northern provinces. Travelers would pass Charikar when traveling to Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz or Puli Khumri. Despite the proximity to Kabul, slightly more than half of the land is not built-up. Of the built-up land almost equal parts is residential (37%) as vacant plots (32%) with a grid network of road coverage amounting to 19% of built-up land area. Charikar is at the gateway to the Panjshir Valley, where the Shamali plains meet the foothills of the Hindu Kush. Charikar is known for its pottery and high-quality grapes. The city of Charikar has a total population of 96,039 (2015) and has 4 Police districts (Nahias) with 3,025 Hectare of total land area. There are 10,671 total number of dwellings in Charikar.  History  In 1221, the Battle of Parvan was fought near Charikar, in which Jalal ud-Din with an army of 30,000 with 100,000 auxiliaries defeated a column of 30,000 men of the invading Mongol army to give part of his army enough time to escape into the northern Punjab, and avoid the immediate consequences of the fall of the Khwarezmid Empire.Man, John (2005) Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection St.Martin's Press, New York, pages 181‚Äì182, At the beginning of the 19th century, Charikar became a flourishing commercial town of several thousand inhabitants. Charikar was the location of major battle during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In 1841 a British garrison was massacred.by Afghans led by Mir Masjidi Khan, and Major Eldred Pottinger was badly wounded In 1842 the British Army returned to lay waste to the town in their campaign of retribution. During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the region around Charikar was the scene to some of the fiercest fighting. Some areas around Charikar served as a stronghold of the Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan (SAMA). Charikar was at the frontline between Ahmad Shah Massoud's Northern Alliance and the Taliban who captured Kabul in 1996. In January 1997 the Taliban took control of Charikar, but Massoud fought back and recaptured it by July.U.S. Conflicts in the 21st Century [3 volumes]: Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and the War on Terror by Spencer C. Tucker In August 1999 the Taliban launched an offensive and briefly captured Charikar, before Massoud counterattacked and drove them out again.Al-Qaida in Afghanistan by Anne Stenersen On August 14, 2011, a team of about six suicide bombers attacked the governor's palace in Charikar. The Governor Abdul Basir Salangi survived but 19 people were killed to which the Taliban claimed responsibility. On 19 May 2020, gunmen opened fire inside a mosque in Charikar, killing 11 worshippers and injuring 16 others when they were offering the evening prayer after breaking their Ramadan fast. The Taliban denied their involvement in the attack. On 26 August, 2020, the city was the site of floods that killed at least 92 people.

Formations This group contains the following formations in descending order: # Tilestones Formation, Downton Castle Sandstone formation (90 ft./27.7 m), # Ledbury Formation shales 270 ft./83 m), # Upper Ludlow sub-group formation (140 ft./43 m), # Aymestry Limestone Formation (up to 40 ft./12.3 m), # Lower Ludlow sub-group formation (350 to 780 ft./108 m-240 m). Geology The Ludlow group is essentially shaly in character, except towards the top, where the beds become more sandy and pass gradually into the Old Red Sandstone. The Aymestry limestone, which is irregular in thickness, is sometimes absent, and where the underlying Wenlock limestones are absent the shales of the Ludlow group graduate, downwards into the Wenlock shales. In Wales the group is typically developed between namesake Ludlow and Aymestrey, and it occurs also in the detached Silurian areas between Dudley and the mouth of the Severn. In the Lake District the Silurian Coldwell beds, forming the upper part of the Coniston Flags, are the equivalents of the Lower Ludlow. They are succeeded by the Coniston Grits (4,000 ft./1,230 m), the Bannisdale Slates (5200 ft./1,600 m) and the Kirkby Moor Flags (2,000 ft./615 m). In the Silurian areas of southern Scotland, the Ludlow rocks are represented in the Kirkcudbright Shore and Riccarton districts by the Raeberry Castle Beds and Balmae Grits (500‚Äì750 ft.). In the northern belt within Lanarkshire and the Pentland Hills, the Lower Ludlow portion consists of mudstones, flaggy shales, and greywackes; and the upper Downton Castle Sandstone part is made up principally of thick red and yellow sandstones and conglomerates with green mudstones. The Ludlow Group formations of Ireland include the Salrock beds of County Galway, and the Croagmarhin beds of Dingle Peninsula of County Kerry. =Lower Ludlow sub-group= The Lower Ludlow rocks are mainly grey, greenish and brown mudstones and sandy and calcareous shales. They contain an abundance of fossils. The Lower Ludlow series has been zoned by means of Monograptus species of Graptolites by E. M. R. Wood. The zonal forms in order from older/lower to younger/upper are: Monograptus vulgaris; Monograptus nilssoni; Monograptus scanicus; Monograptus tumescens; and Monograptus leintwardinensis. In Denbighshire and Merionethshire the upper portion of the Denbighshire Grits belongs to this horizon. Those from lower to upper are: the Nantglyn Flags; the Upper Grit beds; the Monograptus leintwardinensis beds; and the Dinas Bran beds. ;Lower Ludlow fossils Cyathaspis ludensis, the earliest British vertebrate fossil, was found in these rocks at Leintwardine in Herefordshire, a noted fossil locality. Trilobites are numerous (Phacops caudatus, Lichas anglicus, Homolonotus delphinocephalus, Calymene Blumenbachii); brachiopods (Leptaena rhomboidalis, Rhynchonella Wilsoni, Atrypa reticularis), pelecypods (Cardiola interrupts, Ctenodonta sulcata) and gasteropods and cephalopods (many species of Orthoceras and also Gomphoceras, Trochoceras) are well represented. Other fossils are Ceratiocaris, Pterygotus, Protaster, Palaeocoma and Palaeodiscus. =Upper Ludlow sub-group= The Upper Ludlow sub-group rocks are mainly soft mudstones and shales with some harder sandy beds capable of being worked as building-stones. These sandy beds are often found covered with ripple-marks and annelid tracks. One of the uppermost sandy layers is known as the \\" Fucoid bed \\" from the abundance of the seaweed-like impressions it bears. At the top of this sub-group a brown layer occurs, from a quarter of an inch to 4 in. (63 mm to 100 mm) in thickness, full of the fragmentary remains of fish associated with those of Pterygotus and mollusca. This layer, known as the \\"Ludlow Bone bed,\\" has been traced over a very large area. The Tilestones, Downton Castle Sandstone, and Ledbury Formation shales are occasionally grouped together under the term Downtonian. They are in reality passage beds between the Silurian and Old Red Sandstone, and were originally placed in the latter system by Sir Roderick Murchison. They are mostly grey, yellow or red micaceous, shaly sandstones. ;Upper Ludlow fossils The common Upper Ludlow fossils include: plants (Actinophyllum, Chondrites), ostracods, phyllocarids, eurypterids; trilobites (less common than in the older Ludlow sub-groups); numerous brachiopods (Lingula cornea, Lingula minima, Chonetes striatella); crustaceans (ostracods); gasteropods (Phyllocarida, Platyschisma helicites); bivalvia; and cephalopods (Orthoceras bullatum); and fish (Cephalaspis, Cyathaspis, Auchenaspis). Numerous s and ostracods, and ' and ' also occur as fossils.

Four fifths of the cave, including any cave wall art, were permanently or periodically submerged and destroyed by sea water. 150 instances of cave art remain, including several dozen paintings and carvings dating back to the Upper Paleolithic, corresponding to two different phases of occupation of the cave: * Older art consisting of 65 hand stencils and other related motifs, dating to 27,000 years BP (the Gravettian Era). * Newer art of signs and 177 animals dating to 19,000 years BP (the Solutrean Era), representing both \\"classical\\" animals such as bison, ibex, and horses, but also marine animals such as auks and a man with a seal's head.http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/cosquer/cosquer2.php See also * List of Stone Age art * Great auk (on a cave art) References * Jean Clottes, Jean Courtin, La grotte Cosquer, Seuil, 1994, (French) * Jean Clottes, Jean Courtin, Luc Vanrell, Cosquer red√©couvert, Seuil, 2005, (French) * The Cave Beneath the Sea: Paleolithic Images at Cosquer by Jean Clottes and Jean Courtin (1996) Harry N.

It is a decision process which addresses the development of the service life of a building component, building or other constructed work like a bridge or tunnel. Its approach is to ensure a proposed design life has a structured response in establishing its service life normally from a reference or estimated service life framework. Then in turn secure a life-cycle cost profile (or Whole-life cost when called for) whilst addressing environmental factors like life cycle assessment and service life care and end of life considerations including obsolescence and embodied energy recovery. Service life planning is increasingly being linked with sustainable development and wholelife value. The objective of service life planning is to provide reasonable assurance that the estimated service life of a new building on a specific site, with planned maintenance, will be at least as long as the design. Service life planning facilitates the making of well-informed decisions regarding value engineering, cost planning, maintenance planning, and environmental impact. As service life cannot be estimated precisely, the objective requires the making of an appropriately reliable estimate of the service life of the building using available knowledge relating to the service life of each material, component, assembly, and system that is to be used in the building. If the estimated service life of any of these is likely to be less than the design life of the building, a decision should be made as to whether maintenance, repair, or replacement could ensure that its essential functions could be adequately maintained. To assist with specification and design, and avoidance of obsolescence and waste, service life planning may include projections of the needs for, and timing of replacement and end of life recovery. 15686 for service life planning is being prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 59, Building construction - Subcommittee SC 14, Design life. In Great Britain, the new British Standard BS ISO 15686-5:2008 Buildings and constructed assets. Service life planning is currently being launched (September 2008). The life cycle costing standard and the additional Standardized method of life cycle costing for construction (SMLCC) provide an in-depth guide to life cycle costing, an area of increasing importance. The BSI explains that \\"the UK building industry recognizes that life cycle costing (LCC) is necessary and important, but confusion exists about the best method to realise the economic and environmental benefits of such costing\\".

It is located at the intersection of Highways 8 and 23, 20 km northwest of Stratford, and 60 km north of London. Mitchell is no longer a separate entity. On January 1, 1998, the town amalgamated with the neighbouring Townships of Logan, Fullarton, and Hibbert to form the new Municipality of West Perth. As of 2016, the former town of Mitchell has a population of 4,573 in a land area of 4.81 square kilometres; it has 1,827 occupied private dwellings.  History  Mitchell was named for a black settler of the same name who built a small shanty on the nearby Thames River. \\"Perhaps the only place name in Ontario named for a negro\\". Post office opened in 1842. According to a historic plaque erected by the Province, the Canada Company laid out a town plot (Mitchell) on the Huron Road in 1836. In 1837 a log building was built by William Hicks along Huron Road; this was the first settlement in the area. A sawmill was built in 1842, and in 1845, stores and other mills opened. By 1851 the population had reached 150. Mitchell was incorporated as a Village in 1857, after the railway reached the area. Mitchell became a Town in 1874, with a population of 2000. The first mayor was Thomas Matheson. A waterworks system was built in 1889; roadways and sidewalks were paved. Electricity arrived in 1889. By 1901, the population had grown to 2,200. In 1918, a large new elementary school was necessary. A high school was built soon after.  Economy  The town's major employers include Parmalat Canada (the former Stacey Brothers creamery), a producer of dairy products, and Cooper Standard Automotive, the Canadian centre for the company's automotive parts research and development program. Mitchell is an agricultural service centre, surrounded by high-quality farmland. Great Lakes Specialty Meats, a pork producer, has expanded significantly with assistance from Agriculture and Agrifood Canada. In 2011, Mitchell's average per person income was $40,688.  Municipal government  Mitchell is part of West Perth Township and governed accordingly. The Municipality has a Mayor, Deputy Mayor and nine Councillors; one of these represents the Mitchell Ward.  Sports  A sports-oriented town, Mitchell has a number of hockey, baseball, and ringette teams, and is home to the Mitchell Hawks, a junior hockey team that plays in the Western Ontario Junior C Hockey League. Mitchell is the birthplace of professional ice hockey player Howie Morenz. He began his career with the Mitchell Juveniles, 1917‚Äì18, and moved to Stratford where he played with several teams there. In 1923 he joined the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League. He remained in the League for 14 years, 12 with Montreal. In 1950 Morenz was voted the outstanding hockey player of the half century by Canadian Press. He was one of the initial nine inductees into the Hockey Hall of Fame.  Education  In the educational sector, Mitchell has two schools, Upper Thames Elementary and Mitchell District High School. Upper Thames Elementary School is a school from J.K. to 6. This school was built in 1970 to serve the rural population (from the former Townships of Logan, Fullarton, and Hibbert), and replaced numerous one and two room schoolhouses in the rural areas. It is a school that has many activities and fundraisers. In recent years, grade 7 and 8 children from the former Town of Mitchell started attending MDHS, with all town children now attending since the closure of Mitchell Public School in 2010. Mitchell District High School, otherwise known as MDHS, is a secondary school serving grades 7-12. The building, constructed in the late 1950s, is shaped as a square with an open courtyard in the middle, and is one level; there are no stairs which makes it wheelchair accessible. The building replaced a building on St. David Street which now serves as the municipal office for the Municipality of West Perth. Although a small high school, it has a good range of programs, including music, sports and mechanics, and many extra-curricular activities.  Wildlife  Mitchell is located in southwestern Ontario, which has many small rivers and forests patched throughout the landscape. The Thames River runs through the heart of Mitchell, and dense brush and forests run along the northern and southern edges of the town. The brush and forest contain commonly seen animals such as Bufo fowleri, red fox, striped skunk, eastern gray squirrel, eastern cottontail, and the white-tailed deer. The Thames River is home to many varieties of fish, including but not limited to, common carp, mirror carp, chub, rock bass, redeye bass, perch, suckers, crayfish, clams, and minnows. The dam in the Thames River is known as the best fishing spot in Mitchell, as it has a 5‚Äì6 feet deep pool at the bottom where the majority of the carp are seen and caught. Once caught, some fishers will release the carp into the open river, therefore extending the range in the Thames that have carp. Mitchell is also home to the West Perth Wetlands, a location frequented by migratory bird species. It has become a popular spot for Birders from all over Ontario and parts of the U.S. The site was converted from a decommissioned sewage lagoon and includes two ponds that provide two distinct habitats for birds, a shallow front pond for shorebirds and dabbling ducks and a deeper back pond for ducks, swans and geese to swim.http://www.mitchelladvocate.com/2015/10/19/west-perth- wetlands-a-hotspot-for-birds-birders-alike Raccoons have been and are a minor problem in Mitchell. While they normally are seen near the older subdivisions, some can be seen periodically in the new subdivisions or even uptown. They pose a problem of rabies, and when nursing young, have a tendency to attack.

Oil wells (pl. szyby naftowe), erected in 1881 The Petroleum Trail is an international tourist trail which runs from Poland to Ukraine linking places associated with the petroleum industry of the 19th century. Background During the mid 19th and early 20th centuries, significant oil reserves were discovered and developed in Galicia near Drohobych and Boryslav, The first European attempt to drill for oil was in B√≥brka, Krosno County, Western Galicia, in 1854. By 1867, a well at Kleczany was drilled to about 200 meters using steam. On December 31, 1872, a railway line linking Borys≈Çaw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened. American John Simon Bergheim and Canadian William Henry McGarvey came to Galicia in 1882. In 1883, their company, MacGarvey and Bergheim, bored holes of 700 to 1,000 meters and found large oil deposits. In 1885, they renamed their oil developing enterprise the Galician-Karpathian Petroleum Company (), headquartered in Vienna, with McGarvey as the chief administrator and Bergheim as field engineer, and built a huge refinery at Maryampole near Gorlice, in the southeast corner of Galicia. Considered the biggest, most efficient enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole was built in six months and employed 1,000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the oil and natural gas industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of petroleum enterprises to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borys≈Çaw of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the \\"Polish Baku\\", the oil fields of Borys≈Çaw and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austria-Hungary Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borys≈Çaw had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkans conflicts. Galicia was the Central Powers' only major domestic source of oil during the Great War.

The community is west of Milverton and southwest of Listowel. It is part of the Municipality of North Perth. The village is home to the Monkton Wildcats, a Senior Hockey Club of the Western Ontario Athletic Association. The village is situated partly in Logan but largely in Elma.  History  Monkton originated with the construction of the Logan gravel road. In 1857 Mr. T. M. Daly, a contractor on the highway, erected the first building in the new settlement, a blacksmith shop located on 47 Maddison st east. Once the gravel road was completed, a stage route was opened from Mitchell to Newry to carry passengers and provide a mail service between the two communities. Two hotels were built to accommodate travelers, one in Logan, the other in Elma, and a third hotel was built in 1883. In the same period, Mr. Winstanley obtained a grant of 1,000 acres to aid in the establishment of a sawmill. James McKenzie opened a post office. Early settler families included the Dobbs, Stewarts, Holmans, Golightlys, Larkins, McKenzies, Merryfields and Reices. A school was built after the number of families in the village grew. In 1870, a second school was erected and replaced in 1888 by a new building, which served as the local school for many years. At an early period, Monkton had a match factory, two saw mills, planing mill, shingle mill, tannery and several business houses.  Religion  In the mid-nineteenth century, pioneer ministers established a Christian church in the village. The local mercantile store, which was operated by Mr. Dunsmore, served as the first church building. Today there are three churches in Monkton, all within mainline, Protestant denominations: Redeemer Lutheran, Knox Presbyterian and Monkton United Church of Canada.  Today  Monkton continues to be a thriving village that includes a postal service, community library, recreation centre, several churches and a number of other business establishments. Monkton is home of the Monkton Wildcats, a club within the Senior AA Hockey League which is part of Western Ontario Athletic Association.

A spectacular insect much sought after by collectors, the species epithet is after Dr R. Lidderdale, from whose collection the butterfly was first described by William Stephen Atkinson in 1873. Listed under CITES Appendix II, the status of the butterfly has been recorded as rare by some authorities but as being of least concern in 2019 by the Red Book of the IUCN.  Description  Illustration accompanying the first description of the Bhutan glory by W.S. Atkinson in 1873 - top and bottom views The sexes of the Bhutan glory are identical in appearance, having long rounded forewings with convex termen and many-tailed hindwings. The butterfly is dull black above with slim, wavy, cream-coloured striations running vertically across the wings. Above, the hindwing has a prominent, large tornal patch with yellow-orange lunules bordering the tails, central bluish-black patches with white ocelli and a crimson post-discal band on the inner edge. Below, the base colour is greyer, the striations are pronounced and the colours subdued or paler. The detailed description provided by Charles Thomas Bingham (1907) is as follows: Wingspan: 90‚Äì110 mm.  Distribution  Illustration from Bingham's 1907 Butterflies Vol 2 (The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma) The butterfly was described by William Stephen Atkinson in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1873. He writes: George Talbot in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma (1939) provides some interesting detail: The butterfly is found in Bhutan and northeastern India (Assam, Sikkim, Manipur and Nagaland). It is also found in northern Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Szechwan and Yunnan provinces of China.Nazari, Vazrick. (2006). \\"Bhutanitis lidderdalii\\" Atkinson, 1873. Version 7 July 2006 (under construction). The Tree of Life Web Project. Accessed 8 July 2010.  Taxonomy  There are a total of four subspecies of B. lidderdalii. These subspecies (with type localities) are: * B. lidderdalii lidderdalii Atkinson 1873 \\\\- (nominate) Buxa, Bhutan * B. lidderdalii spinosa Stichel, 1907 \\\\- Sichuan, China * B. lidderdalii ocellatomaculata Igarashi, 1979 \\\\- Chiang Mai, northern Thailand * B. lidderdalii nobucoae Morita, 1997 \\\\- north Kachin, Myanmar  Status  Natural History Museum in Oslo The Bhutan glory has been considered to be \\"rare\\" by Indian authors such as William Harry Evans (1932), Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) and Isaac Kehimkar (2009). The nominate subspecies is protected under law in India. However Collins and Morris (1985) in the IUCN Red Data Book on the threatened swallowtails of the world gives it a status of \\"insufficiently known\\" arguing that the Bhutan glory is widely distributed and hence unlikely to be in danger at the moment though more information is needed on this comparatively poorly known species. In 2019, it was listed as a least concern species in the Red List of the IUCN. International trade in B. lidderdalii is restricted under CITES Appendix II. Habitat loss due to excessive felling of forests may be a significant threat regionally. The Thai subspecies, found in northern Thailand around Chiang Mai is considered to be a relict population and hundreds of specimens were collected annually for the specimen. It is now believed to be extinct, probably due to loss of the population and damage to its habitat by forest fire.  Habitat  B. lidderdalii flies from in its Indian range. It generally keeps to the ridges rather than the valleys.  Habits  Flies at tree-top level, with a slow, drifting, unpredictable flight akin to that of the tree nymph (Idea lynceus). The butterflies transparent greyish underside makes it difficult to distinguish in the shadows. During rain, it sits on leaves with the forewings drooped over the hindwings, concealing its bright upper colouration. The butterfly has a habit of hill-topping and visits flowers of diverse species.  Life cycle  It is known to have two broods - the first in May and June and the second from August to October. Likely to be unpalatable due to its food plant being Aristolochia species.  Food plant  Larva on Aristolochia species such as A. kaempferii, A. mandshuriensis, A. griffithii, A. shimadai and A. debilis (Igarashi, 1985, 1989).Bhutanitis lidderdalii on Markku Savela's website \\"Lepidoptera and some other life forms\\".

History ASO Chlef was founded on June 13, 1947, as Association Sportive d'Orl√©ansville, Orl√©ansville being the colonial name of Chlef at the time. The club was founded by the indigenous Algerian Muslim community of the city who wanted a club to rival the already existing European club in the city, Groupement Sportif Orl√©ansville. In its first season of existence, the club finished second in the third division. In the following two seasons, it won promotion to the first division. After Algeria gained its independence in 1962, the name of the city was changed from Orl√©ansville to El Asnam and the club changed its name to Asnam Sportive Olympique, keeping its original ASO initials. On June 21, 2005, ASO Chlef won its first domestic title after beating USM S√©tif 1‚Äì0 in the final of the 2005 Algerian Cup with a goal from Mohamed Messaoud in extra-time. By winning the Cup, they also qualified for continental competition for the first time, earning a spot in the 2006 CAF Confederation Cup. However, their run in African competition came to a quick end. After walking over ASC Entente of Mauritania in the preliminary round, they lost to AS Douanes of Senegal 1‚Äì0 on aggregate in the first round. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, ASO Chlef achieved its best league finish to date by finishing second in the Algerian Championnat National, 10 points behind champions JS Kabylie. On June 21, 2011, led by head coach Meziane Ighil, ASO Chlef won its first Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1 title after second-placed CR Belouizdad lost to USM El Harrach.Ligue 1 : L'ASO Chlef est champion 2010/2011 On May 12, 2012, ASO Chlef beat Sudanese club Al-Hilal 4‚Äì2 in a penalty shoot-out in the second round of the 2012 CAF Champions League after the two legs ended up tied 2‚Äì2 to qualify to the group stage for the first time in the club's history.

These develop dynamically after the activation of follicular B cells by T-dependent antigen. As they undergo rapid and mutative cellular division, B cells of the germinal center are known as centroblasts. Once these B cells have stopped proliferating, they are known as centrocytes, and are subjected to selection by follicular helper T (TFH) cells in the presence of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Germinal centers are an important part of the B cell humoral immune response, acting as central factories for the generation of affinity matured B cells specialized in producing improved antibodies that effectively recognize infectious agents, and for the production of durable memory B cells. Process # Within lymph nodes, mature peripheral B cells known as follicular (Fo) B cells acquire antigen from FDCs and in turn present it to cognate CD4+ TFH cells at the border that demarcates the T cell zone and B cell follicles (also known as lymphoid follicles). # After several rounds of cellular division, the B cells go through somatic hypermutation, a process by which they mutate their antibody-encoding DNA and thus generate a diversity of clones in the germinal center. This involves pseudo-random substitutions biased towards regions encoding the antigen recognition surface of the antibodies the B cells produce. This phenomenon underscores the process of affinity maturation, whereby greater affinity antibodies are produced and selected for after antigen recognition. # Upon receiving an unidentified stimulus, the maturing B cells (centroblasts) migrate from the dark zone to the light zone and start to express their antibody on the cell surface and at this stage are referred to as centrocytes. The centrocytes are in a state of activated apoptosis and compete for survival signals derived from FDCs and TFH cells. This rescue process, known as germinal center selection, is believed to be dependent on the affinity of their surface antibody to the antigen. Such that, a B cell that has successfully gained mutations that confer a higher affinity surface antibody towards antigen gains a survival advantage over lower affinity B cell clones and those that have gained deleterious mutations. Cyclic re-entry into the dark zone once again as centroblasts allows a chance for otherwise non- selected B cell mutants to gain more mutations in order to improve affinity towards antigen. Interactions with T cells are also believed to prevent the generation of autoreactive germinal center B cells. # At some unclear stage of their centroblast-centrocyte cycling, maturing B cells receive a final differentiation signal to exit the germinal center as an antibody producing plasma cell which are cells that secrete large quantities of antibody or a memory B cell that can be reactivated in subsequent contacts with the same antigen. Selected B cells may also restart the whole cycle of mutative centroblast division and centrocyte selection. In this way the adaptive immune system, in part through these germinal center reactions, can gradually better recognize antigens over time. Morphology at different stages The morphology of GCs is very specific and shows properties which are characteristic for different stages of the reaction. * In an early state of the reaction a network of FDCs is fully filled with proliferating B cells. * Later at day 4 of the reaction, GCs show a separation of two zones, the dark and the light zone. The former still contains dominantly proliferating and mutating B cells while the latter one is the area of B cell selection. * These zones dissolve after 10 days of GC development which ends after about 3 weeks. Medical relevance As germinal centers are important structures of the adaptive immune system, their deregulation is implied in many immune diseases, for example rheumatoid arthritis, immunodeficiency and many lymphomas like DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma.

The species was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1775. Description left The ground colour of the upperside of both males and females is white. The forewing has the cell crossed by five short black bands, of which the basal extends to the dorsum, the sub-basal into interspace 1, the medial and pre-apical up to the median vein, and the apical or fifth along the discocellulars; this last band extends broadly on both sides of the veinlets and terminates at the lower apex of the cell; beyond these are broad postdiscal and terminal black transverse bands from costa to tornal angle; the two bands coalesce below vein 4 and terminate in a point at the tornus; the white portions of the cell anteriorly overlaid with pale green; short broken glossy green bands between the black cellular apical band and the discal band and anteriorly between the latter and the terminal band. The upperside of the hindwing has the basal three-fourths uniformly white, with black markings on the underside that show through; the terminal fourth dark grey traversed by a curved irregular subterminal series of black crescent shaped marks that ends in a black tornal spot and a terminal black band that follows the indentations of the wing; the emargination (notches in a margin) below the black tornal spot are edged with ochraceous; the tail blackish grey, edged and tipped with white. The underside of the forewing is similar to the upperside in markings but the green shading over the white portions in the basal half of the cell more decided; the discal and terminal transverse black bands are separate, and are not joined posteriorly, the former edged posteriorly on both sides by dark grey due to the black on the upperside that shows through by transparency. The underside of the hindwing is half green on the basal part while the outer half white; a large black tornal spot; a black line along the dorsum that curves above the tornal spot outwards to vein 2; a straight subbasal black band from costa across cell that terminates on vein 2, where it joins the dorsal black line; a broader black band from costa across apex of cell extended into base of interspace 3; an irregular discal series of black markings curved inwards posteriorly towards the tornal spot; a subterminal series of very small slender black lunules in pairs, the ground colour on the inner side of these darkened to rich ochreous yellow; lastly, a series of short terminal black bars in the interspaces so arranged as to follow indentations of the termen; tail dusky black edged with white. Antenna black; head and thorax anteriorly with a broad black medial band, rest of thorax bluish; abdomen white, marked beneath on each side by a black stripe. Male alcibiades Race alcibiades, Fabr. is the most widely spread race of antiphates, from which it differs as follows: Upperside of males and females, all the black markings shorter and narrower. Forewing: the discal and terminal bands separate, the former rarely extended below vein 3, the latter in no specimen reaches the dorsal margin. Hindwing: the broad grey area on the terminal margin reduced to a small patch of grey at the apices of interspaces 2 to 4; the subterminal black markings rarely present anteriorly, generally confined to the limits of the grey patch. Underside: the extent of the black markings similarly reduced, otherwise as in the typical form. The width and length of the transverse black markings on the upperside of the forewing, also the extent of the grey terminal area and the presence or absence of the black subterminal markings on the upperside of the hindwing, are all very variable. Form nebulosus, Butler, is a melanistic variety recorded from Sikkim. Var. continentalis, Eimer, has the caudal area of the hindwing on the upperside suffused with black. Var. itamputi, Butler, has the postdiscal and terminal black bands on the upperside of the forewing united posteriorly, but neither band extends up to the tornus. Var. ceylanicus, Eimer, has the basal two bands on the upperside of the forewing extended beyond the median vein, the preapical cellular band not triangular and extended to the median vein. Habits It is known to mud-puddle. Life history The caterpillar is white in the early stage and turns yellow in the last instar. In its late stage, it is like the caterpillar of Pathysa nomius. (Davidson & Aitken quoted in Bingham) The green pupa, is as in all swallowtails, is held by a silk girdle. Said to be found mainly on the plant Unona lawii and never under stones.

Although it is not strictly a Public Information Film, it is often considered to be so by fans of the genre. The film, which was shown in schools all over Great Britain, is based around a young boy suffering a disfiguring and/or fatal accident when he trespasses on a railway line, with three different versions being made to demonstrate the dangers of both electrified and non-electrified lines. When it was first released, all three versions were narrated and introduced by Peter Purves, later replaced by Keith Chegwin when the films were revised. Robbie was written and directed by Ronald Dunkley and produced by James Ritchie. It was a replacement for the controversial and extremely graphic The Finishing Line, and was itself later replaced by a more modern film called Killing Time. Plot All three variants of the film show Robbie, a young boy of about 8 years old with a keen interest in both trains and football, being persuaded by his elder brother to climb through a hole in the fence surrounding a nearby railway line and go onto the track. The three different editions continue as follows: * Version 1 (non-electrified railway lines): As he is walking along the railway line, Robbie gets the laces of his football boots caught in the track, and desperately tries to pull his feet free. We then hear and see a train approaching. The shoelace then pops and Robbie stumbles back in time, but trips on the other tracks; then we hear and see another train approaching. * Version 2 (overhead electric line): To encourage Robbie to cross the train tracks Robbie's brother snatches Robbie's football boots and throws them to the other side of the track. Unfortunately they get caught on the overhead electric line and when Robbie tries to retrieve them with a long metal pole he is electrocuted. * Version 3 (third rail electrified line): Robbie accidentally steps on the electrified third rail and is electrocuted. In the next scene, Robbie's mother is informed that Robbie has been seriously injured, and has had to have both feet amputated. The cause of the injury is not mentioned, because it is different in all three variants. The film ends with a disfigured Robbie confined to a wheelchair. He is watching some other children play football, with a commentary by the narrator about how he will never be able to play again. The final shot is of his football boots hanging up on the back of his bedroom door at home.

The butterfly is also called the green-spotted triangle, tailed green jay, or green triangle. It is a common, non-threatened species native to Nepal, India, Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia and Australia. Several geographic races are recognized. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Range Southern India to Saurashtra, northern India (Kumaon to Assam), Nepal, Sri Lanka, Andamans, Nicobars, Bangladesh, Brunei, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, southern China (including Hainan), Taiwan, South East Asia to New Guinea, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, and Australia (northern Queensland). Description Tailed jay searching for nectar, Hyderabad, India Male upperside black. Forewing with the following green markings: a spot at the extreme base of the costal margin, a transverse short bar near base of cell and seven spots beyond, two and two except the apical spot which is single; two spots beyond apex of cell; a spot at base of interspaces 1a and 1, followed by two oblique short macular bands; a discal series of spots decreasing in size towards the costa, and a postdiscal series of smaller spots that begins with two in interspace 1; the spots in interspace 7 in both series are out of line, placed outwards. Hindwing: three series of similarly-coloured markings that ran transversely across the wing more or less parallel to the dorsal margin, the upper markings (those in interspace 7) white; a short greenish stripe at the extreme base of the wing. Ventral view Underside: fuliginous (sooty) brown or brownish black, more or less suffused with pink along the costal margin, on apical area and along the outer margin of the discal markings on the forewing, broadly along the dorsal and terminal margins and at base on interspaces 6 and 7 on the hindwing; markings similar to those on the upperside but less clearly defined and somewhat more grey in tint. Hindwing black, inwardly red-margined spots superposed on the pink area in interspaces 6 and 7. Cilia very narrow, pale pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, thorax above and the abdomen on the sides streaked with greenish grey; beneath: ochreous grey touched on the thorax with pink. Female similar, but with a streak of greenish white along the dorsal margin on both upper and undersides. Race decoratus is found in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and is very similar to the typical form, from which it can be distinguished as follows: Upperside green spots smaller, especially the discal series on the forewing. Underside hindwing: the red postcostal spot is relatively small but the red part has much increased against the black part; besides the large red anal mark and the mark before the first disco-cellular veinlet, there is a large red spot in the lower median cellule (interspace 2), a smaller red spot in each of the three preceding cellules (interspaces 3, 4, 5) and a streak-like spot at the base of the lower median cellule. Status Graphium agamemnon is common and not threatened. Habitat Once found primarily close to wooded country where there is a fairly heavy rainfall, the tailed jay is now very common at low elevations and regularly seen in gardens and urban areas due to its food plant, Polyalthia longifolia (false ashoka or mast tree), being widely used as an ornamental tree. Behaviour Strong and restless fliers, they are very active butterflies and flutter their wings constantly even when at flowers. They are seldom seen drinking from damp patches. The males are particularly fond of nectaring from flowers such as Lantana, Ixora, Mussaenda, and Poinsettia. The females are more likely caught when looking for food plants or laying eggs. Tailed jays are active throughout the year but their abundance depends upon the local monsoon and availability of the larval host plants. The butterflies generally fly among the tree-tops but descend to ground level in search of flowers or host plants. Because of their relatively fast life cycle (just over one month from egg to adult), tailed jays are multivoltine and may produce up to seven or eight broods per year. Tailed jay, Kolkata, West Bengal, India It has been noted in one instance to be attracted to lights at night. Life cycle This species can take from 33‚Äì36 days from egg to adult. The species is multivoltine with at least seven or eight broods in a year. JPG file. bp.blogspot.com =Eggs= The eggs are pale yellow and are laid singly on the underside of young leaves, and hatch after three or four days. =Larva= Young larvae are dark yellowish green with a pale yellow band in the middle of the abdomen. From the head, which is moderately large, the body increases in thickness rapidly to the 4th or 5th segment and then tapers gradually down to the tail. It has four pairs of spines. The colour is at first smoky black, but at the last moult becomes a light clear green faintly marked with lines of a darker shade. The fully grown larva is green, fusiform and having small black spots. It has a pair of osmeterium and black spines on each thoracic segment, the third pair being orange yellow. A fourth pair is situated on the last segment. The caterpillars undergo five instars over a period of 15‚Äì16 days, during which many are attacked by parasitoid wasps. =Pupa= The pupae are green or brownish. They are found attached on the underside of leaves; sometimes on the upperside, and are held in place with a body girdle. The pupal stage lasts for 13‚Äì14 days. The horns are tipped with rusty brown.

The populations of the mimicking morphs of the common Mormon are much smaller than that of their models - the common or crimson rose. This allows first time predators a much greater chance of preying upon the unpalatable model in the first instance and thus learning of their inedibility. Larger populations of mimics could result in the edible common Mormon mimics being sampled the first time by predators. If this should happen, the predator may not realise that butterflies of that colour and pattern are protected by the poisons they ingest; thus dramatically reducing the effectiveness of this scheme of protection. In Sulawesi, although the common rose is abundant, the common Mormon female morph which is found there, mimics a completely different butterfly, Atrophaneura polyphontes. A single gene, doublesex, regulates the complex wing patterns, colors and structures required for this mimicry. Habitat The common Mormon prefers lightly wooded country, but is present everywhere and high up into the hills. It is a regular visitor to gardens, being especially abundant in orchards of its food plants‚Äîoranges and limes. It is most common in the monsoon and post-monsoon months.  Habits  Female form romulus seen laying an egg on Murraya paniculata The common Mormon is fond of visiting flowers and its long proboscis permits it to feed from flowers having long corollar tubes. It is particularly fond of Lantana, Jatropha, Ixora, and Mussaenda in city gardens. In the forests, the common Mormon remains low keeping within ten feet off the floor and its prefer to visit Asystasia, Peristrophe, and Jasminum for nectar. The male common Mormon is a very common visitor to gardens where he will be seen hovering over flowers when the sun is shining. It is a restless insect, zigzagging fast and straight close to the ground, settling down only when it halts to feed. The mimic female Mormons, stichius and romulus are very convincing mimics due to their habits, especially the flight patterns, being very similar to those of the rose models. However, lacking the protection of inedibility, they tend to be more easily disturbed than the roses and fly off erratically . Only the males take part in mud puddling, usually in cool shaded spots rather than in open areas. They have been known to collect on saline soils to extract minerals.Pola, M., Garc√≠a-Par√≠s, M. (2005). Marine puddling in Papilio polytes (Lepidoptera Papilionidae). Florida Entomologist 88: 211-213. Both sexes bask in the sun on shrubs close to the ground. They hold their wings flat against the substratum. The forewing is lowered to cover part of the hindwing and is a typical stance of the common Mormon. Common Mormons spend the night settled on vegetation with their wings held open, usually quite close to the ground.

They are courted by the males who approach from behind and slowly and elegantly settle into position. =Eggs= The eggs are laid singly on top of the leaves. They are round and yellow to light-orange in colour. =Caterpillar= The first few instars of the caterpillar closely resemble those of the lime butterfly. The later instars become dark green in colour. There is a transverse black band with an eye-spot on each side on the 4th and 5th segments. This band, being darker and brighter than that of the lime butterfly caterpillar, is the key distinction between the two. The common Mormon caterpillar also has a black and white oblique band on the 8th and 9th segments, making it resemble that of the blue Mormon. The deep red osmeterium and yellowish-brown head help distinguish it from the blue Mormon caterpillar which has a greenish head. Common Mormon caterpillars are heavily parasitised by chalcid wasps, with over a hundred tiny wasps eventually emerging from each Mormon pupa. =Pupa= The pupa is located on underside of leaves and twigs. The pupa is light green and unmarked. It has two projections to the front on its head and also one on its thorax. It closely resembles the lime butterfly caterpillar but can be distinguished by: * the projections on the head which have a deeper indentation between them. * the abdomen which protrudes to a small point on each side.

It is widely distributed and has thirteen subspecies. The female is polymorphic and with mimetic forms. Range Its range includes north-eastern India (including Sikkim, Assam and Nagaland), Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nicobar Islands, Andaman Islands (stragglers only), western, southern and eastern China (including Hainan), Taiwan southern Japan, Ryukyu Islands, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Kampuchea, Malaysia and Indonesia (Sumatra, Mentawai Islands, Nias, Batu, Simeulue, Bangka, Java, Kalimantan and the Lesser Sunda Islands). Status This species is common and not threatened. The cultivation of citrus all over Southern Asia provides an abundance of food plants. Description and polymorphy The butterfly is large with a span. It has four male and many female forms, the females being highly polymorphic and many of them being mimics of unpalatable butterflies. This species has been studied extensively for understanding the genetic basis for polymorphy and Batesian mimicry. As many as twenty-six female forms are reported. =Typical form agenor= *Male. Tailless, above deep blue to black. It may or may not have red streak on the forewing at the base of the cell. *Female. Tailless. Upperside forewing ground colour sepia, streaked with greyish white. The basal third part of the cell is red and is touched outwardly with white. Upper hindwing is blue black. It has five to seven yellow or white discal patches. =Female form butlerianus= *Tailless.

The sides of the abdomen are yellow. *Upperside forewing greyish brown with veins and streaks between them black. The cell is red at the base. There is a velvety black patch at the bases of veins 1 and 2 of the upperside forewing. *Upperside hindwing is black with part of the cell white. There are white streaks around it. The tornus is red with a large black spot. There is a row of red terminal spots between the vein. =Male and female form polymnestoroides= *Tailless. *Male. Upperside hindwing and forewing have short blue discal stripes. *Female. The upperside forewing is sepia with pale grey streaks amongst the veins. The base of the cell is red. The upperside hindwing is velvety brown with a blue discal area and has black spots, as in the case of the blue Mormon (P. polymnestor), which it mimics. Habitat This species flies up to in the Himalayas, but is most common at low elevations. Behaviour This butterfly is found in forest clearings. It is very common and is also seen amongst human habitation. It visits flowers of Poinsettia, Jasminum, Lantana, Canna and Salvia. It usually flies above the ground. The butterfly is known to mud-puddle. The males are much more common than females. The female forms butlerianus and alcanor are especially uncommon. Life cycle The larva resembles that of the common Mormon (P. polytes), being green with whitish markings. It is heavily parasitised.

Gerard Cio≈Çek, Tatra Mountains, Poland, mid-1950s, a photo from the collection of Dr T. Matthew Ciolek.  Biography  Gerard Antoni Cio≈Çek was born in Wy≈ºnica, a small town in the Austro-Hungarian Duchy of Bukovina (in present-day Ukraine). His parents, Adolf and Ludwika (n√©e Melz) Cio≈Çek were from Galicia and Bukovina . His father was a high-ranking official at the Austrian Tax Office, first in Kuty, then in nearby Wy≈ºnica in Carpathia. Following the end of World War I, and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Wy≈ºnica was incorporated into Romania. In 1921, the Cio≈Çeks and their two children left Bukovina for the newly established Republic of Poland, and settled in the southern city of Lublin. In 1929, on graduating from the Stanis≈Çaw Staszic Lycee in Lublin , Gerard Cio≈Çek embarked on tertiary studies in the country's capital, Warsaw. Initially he intended to take up drawing and painting (especially \\"en plein air\\" watercolours) at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts (Akademia Sztuk Piƒôknych). Eventually, however, he chose to study architecture at the Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska). In the mid-1930s, Cio≈Çek was a research assistant to professor Oskar Sosnowski at the Politechnika Warszawska, a man under whom he deepened his studies on Polish folk architecture, and the conservation of architectural heritage. Around 1937 he developed an interest in the history and design of parks and gardens. He was also interested in town-planning, regional planning, and in the harmony between human settlements and their fragile ecologies. In June 1939, he married Regina Najder (1917‚Äì2005) from an extensive family of aristocrats, landowners, railway and sugar refinery engineers, doctors, and businessmen from Kiev and south-western Ukraine, which was then part of the Russian empire. At the beginning of World War II, in September 1939, Cio≈Çek served in the Polish Army as a Second Lieutenant (2Lt) in an air-defense unit in Wilno. Between 1940‚Äì1944, during the Nazi and Soviet occupation, he lived in German- held Warszawa where he joined the Armia Krajowa (\\"Polish Home Army\\"). For his pseudonym, while in the Resistance, he chose \\"Bia≈Ça\\" (his clan's battle-cry) . He was a lecturer in architecture and town planning at the now-banned, underground Politechnika Warszawska. In early 1944, he earned his Ph.D. for his research on the effect of the physical environment on the forms of villages and folk architecture in Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1944 he took part in the Warsaw Uprising, where he was in charge of the defense of the Krasi≈Ñski Library (Biblioteka Ordynacji Krasi≈Ñskich w Warszawie) building, and took part in the battle for the German SS-held PAST skyscraper. Following the defeat of the uprising he was interned in POW camps in Pomerania, and near L√ºbeck (northern Germany). After the end of World War II in Europe, and a brief tour of duty with the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland) (1 Samodzielna Brygada Spadochronowa ‚Äì SBS) stationed in north-western Germany, he returned to Poland in December 1945. He was reunited with his wife and son, Krzysztof Oskar Cio≈Çek (1940‚Äì1953) in Olsztyn. The family returned to Warsaw. Between 1946 and his death in 1966, Cio≈Çek lectured at the Institute of Architecture at the Politechnika Warszawska. From 1948 he was also professor of Urban Planning and Landscape Design at the Cracow University of Technology (Politechnika Krakowska). In the early-1950s he co-designed a tourist chalet in the Tatra Mountains, the 'Schronisko G√≥rskie PTTK w Dolinie Piƒôciu Staw√≥w Polskich', which opened in 1954. During those 20 years of work in Krak√≥w and Warsaw he taught students, supervised roughly fourteen Doctoral dissertations, worked on the reconstruction of over 100 historical parks in Poland that included sites in Arkadia, Baran√≥w Sandomierski, Krasiczyn, Lubart√≥w, Niebor√≥w, Rogalin, as well as the Royal Park in Wilan√≥w )). He was a member of the State Council for the Nature Conservation ('Panstwowa Rada Ochrony Przyrody', PROP), as well as served on the Boards of Directors of the Tatra National Park and the Pieniny National Park. He authored more than 60 research papers and books. His groundbreaking work, Ogrody Polskie (Gardens of Poland), was published in 1954. In 1958, Cio≈Çek was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta ('Krzyz Kawalerski Orderu Odrodzenia Polski'). In 1965, he embarked on two of his largest projects yet: a history of monastic architecture in Poland over the past 1,000 years; and an encyclopaedia of world gardens and garden design. However, he died the following year, aged 56, while skiing in the Tatra Mountains, without completing this final work. His unpublished research is archived as the Teki Cio≈Çka (Cio≈Çek files) here.

There are < 10,000 adults left in the wild.BirdLife Species Factsheet With a length of about , it is among the largest Bucerotine hornbills. The underparts, neck and head are rich rufous in the male, but black in the female. Description An immature of the species from Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh. An adult in flight Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in West Bengal. An adult from Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in West Bengal. The head, neck, and lower body of the male are coloured rufous, with deeper colouration on the flanks and abdomen. The middle primaries and the lower half of the tail are tipped white. The rest of the hornbill's plumage is a glossy dark-green and black. The lower tail-covert feathers are coloured chestnut mixed with black. The female, on the other hand, is black, except for the end-portion of her tail and the tips of the middle primaries, which are white. Juvenile hornbills resemble adults of the same sex, but lack the ridges at the base of the upper beak. The beak lacks a true caique but is thickened at its base. It has a number of dark ridges on the upper beak which are absent in the young and increase in number with age up to about seven. The commissure of the beaks is broken for both sexes. Distribution Of all hornbills, this species has the northernmost extent, ranging from north-eastern India to western Thailand and north-western Vietnam. In India, the hornbill has been recorded from the following protected areas: * Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh. * Manas National Park, Assam. * Buxa Tiger Reserve, West Bengal. * Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary, West Bengal. * Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh. * Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh. * Sessa Orchid Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh. * Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh. The western limit of the rufous-necked hornbill is the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in West Bengal. Kinnaird and O'Brien (2007) have tabulated data for the hornbills of the world and report that rufous-necked hornbills range over of area, of which of area are forested. Within this area, rufous- necked hornbills occur in 90 protected areas comprising of protected forest but only including 7% of optimal hornbill habitat. Ecology While predominantly a bird of ridged and hilly forests, chiefly broadleaved forests at altitudes of , it has also been recorded in dry woodland. The nesting period is from March to June, the trees preferred are tall and have broad girths. These hornbill communities move between one forest to another depending on seasonally to forage from fruiting trees that change with local conditions. Describing the egg, Hume (1889) states: :The egg is a broad oval, compressed somewhat towards one end, so as to be slightly pyriform. The shell is strong and thick, but coarse and entirely glossless, everywhere pitted with minute pores. In colour it is a very dirty white, with a pale dirty yellowish tinge, and everywhere obscurely stippled, when closely examined, with minute purer white specks, owing to the dirt not having got down into the bottoms of the pores. It measures 2-25 by 1'75 (inches). Culture \\"Bulup\\" or Cane hat of the Minyong tribe of East Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh with hornbill beak, most likely that of rufous-coloured hornbill The rufous-necked hornbill occurs in Sanskrit literature under the epithet vƒÅrdhrƒ´nasa, a term which at times also has been used to refer to other Bucerotidae. In Arunachal Pradesh, rufous-necked hornbills have been hunted by tribals for their feathers and beak. Conservation Already listed in CITES Appendices I & II, the species is vulnerable but occurs in a number of protected areas in India, China, Thailand and Bhutan. Due to increased information coming in about range and extent, it has been suggested that the rufous-necked hornbill be downgraded from IUCN status \\"Vulnerable\\" to \\"Near Threatened\\". Recent initiatives by the Wildlife Trust of India, Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department and other citizens to conserve hornbills, which also target the rufous-necked hornbill, are the Hornbill Nest Adoption Programme, and a programme for replacing the use of real beaks with fibre-made replicas. .

There are approximately sixteen subspecies with differing geographical distributions. Description Common bluebottle at Keitakuen Upperside opaque black. Forewings and hindwings crossed from above the tornal area on the hindwing to near the apex of the forewing by a semi-hyaline broad pale blue medial band which is broadest in the middle, more or less greenish and macular anteriorly; the portion of the band that crosses interspaces 6, 7 and 8 on the hindwing white; beyond the band on the hindwing there is a sub-terminal line of blue slender lunules. Underside similar, ground colour dark brown. Hindwing: a short comparatively broad sub-basal band from costa to sub-costal vein, and the postdiscal area between the medial blue band and the sub-terminal lunules velvety black traversed by the pale veins and transversely, except in interspaces 6 and 7, by narrow crimson lines; lastly, a crimson spot near the tornal angle with an admarginal yellowish-white spot below it. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen brown, the head and thorax suffused with greenish grey; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen touched with dingy white, the abdomen with two whitish lateral lines. Male has abdominal fold within grey, furnished with a tuft of long, somewhat stiff white hairs. Race teredon, Felder. (South India and Sri Lanka) is distinguishable in both sexes by the narrower medial band that crosses both forewing and hindwing. Colour brighter, the contrast between the green of the upper and the blue of the lower portion of the medial band more vivid. Hindwing more produced posteriorly at apex of vein 3, where it forms an elongate tooth or short tail. Variously reported with wingspans between 55 and 75 mm, the common bluebottle has black upper wings and brown lower wings. Both forewings and hindwings are marked by a central spot in the form of a blue or blue-green triangle, with apex pointing toward the body. Habitat Graphium sarpedon is primarily an inhabitant of moist, low-level rain forests (below 1600 m (5000 ft)). In these elevations it is usually seen flying just above the tree canopy. The larvae of the common bluebottle feed on trees of the laurel family, which includes the cinnamon tree, and have expanded their range to include cinnamon tree plantations. In eastern Australia, they have adapted to a drier subtropical environment, and are commonly seen in suburban gardens in Queensland and New South Wales.

Subspecies found in India occur in southern India in the Western Ghats and in the Himalayas from Kashmir in the west to Myanmar. G. s. milon and G. s. monticolum, however, are not listed here as they are regarded as separate species in a number of works. Behaviour The males are known for their habit of feeding by the edges of puddles, often at the roadside. Occasionally, as many as eight will be seen at the same puddle. They have also been known to be attracted to animal droppings, carcasses and rotting insects. It has been recorded as a migrant in South India and is known to mud-puddle during migration. The butterfly has been seen as comprising as much as 5% of the population of migrating butterflies during a 72-hour period in the Nilgiri hills. The common bluebottle is known for quick flight and rapid reactions. Consequently, it is difficult to catch. =Diet= Feeding on Lantana camara. The ventral surface of the wings are visible. The adult common bluebottle feeds on nectar from a variety of flowering herbs. The larvae feed primarily on the leaves of trees in the families Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae, and Rutaceae. In particular, G.s. sarpedon and G.s. teredon often feed on leaves of the cinnamon bark tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) or of the Indian laurel (Litsea sebifera).

The larvae of G. s. choredon, native to Australia, feed on many native Australian species of genera Cryptocarya and Litsea; and virtually all subspecies feed on leaves of the camphor tree, Cinnamomum camphora, which is native to China but has been naturalized throughout south-east Asia. Life cycle =Egg= The egg is yellowish, laid singly on the leaves of a host plant. =Larva= When young, is black or dark green, with numerous spines; when full grown, it is green with a short spines on each thoracic segment and anal segment. There is a transverse yellow band on the 4th segment and a lateral band on the body. The caterpillar usually lies on the centre of a leaf on an upper surface. It is very sluggish and pupates near its feeding spot. Frederic Moore quoted in Bingham, 1907, described it as: \\"Smooth, thickened from the second to the 5th segment and thence decreasing to the end; with two short subdorsal fleshy spines on the 4th segment, between which is a transverse pale yellow line, two shorter spines also on the 2nd and 3rd and two on the anal segment; colour green, with a longitudinal posterior lateral and lower pale yellowish line.\\" =Pupa= The pupa is green with a slender and pointed thoractic projection, yellowish wing cases and lateral bands. \\"Conical, truncated in front; thorax produced into a lengthened obtusely-pointed frontal process.\\" (Frederic Moore quoted in Bingham, 1907) References General reading  s External links * NHM Caterpillar hosts database sarpedon Category:Butterflies of India Category:Butterflies of Australia Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Butterflies of Singapore Category:Butterflies of Indochina ","title":"Graphium sarpedon"},{"id":"3625400","text":"The red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), also known as the Asian king vulture, Indian black vulture or Pondicherry vulture, is an Old World vulture mainly found in the Indian subcontinent, with small disjunct populations in some parts of Southeast Asia.

Ranthambore Taxonomy and systematics This is a species of Old World vulture found in the Indian subcontinent. It has no subspecies. Distribution and habitat This gaudy-faced vulture was historically abundant, range widely across the Indian subcontinent, and also eastwards to south-central and south-eastern Asia, extending from India to Singapore. Today the range of the red-headed vulture is localized primarily to northern India. It is usually in open country and in cultivated and semi-desert areas. It is also found in deciduous forests and foothills and river valleys. It is usually found up to an altitude of 3000m from sea level. At Berlin Zoo Individual at Ranthambore National Park Conservation status The red-headed vulture used to be declining, but only slowly; in 2004 the species was uplisted to near threatened from least concern by the IUCN. The widespread use of the NSAID diclofenac in veterinary medicine in India has caused its population to collapse in recent years, however. Diclofenac is a compound now known to be extremely poisonous to vultures. The red-headed vulture population has essentially halved every other year since the late 1990s, and what once was a plentiful species numbering in the hundreds of thousands has come dangerously close to extinction in less than two decades. Consequently, it was uplisted to critically endangered in the 2007 IUCN Red List. Several NSAIDs have been found to be harmful to scavenging birds. Diclofenac, carprofen, flunixin, ibuprofen and phenylbutazone were associated with mortality. Meloxicam has thus far been found to be \\"Vulture-Safe\\" and its use in veterinary treatment of livestock is being encouraged. The red-headed vulture has started becoming more harder to come by as it is being hunted down. Places like Cambodia have put together special programs to help critically endangered vulture species.

The goal of staging is to make a home appealing to the highest number of potential buyers, thereby selling a property more swiftly and for more money. Staging techniques focus on improving a property's appeal by insuring it is a welcoming, attractive product that any buyer can see himself/herself living in and, thus, desire to purchase. Staging requires a monetary investment into selling what are some people's greatest investment: their home and property. So it is not just decorating, but also needs to include an understanding of how to find the equity in that home and property, where the Real Estate market is for that home, in that neighborhood, so the homeowner can choose where to make those investments. Comparable houses for sale on the market in the area also needs to be considered to know how to stage the home so it sells quickly and for more money. Return on Investment is the purpose of Staging. As for simple decorating to stage, people often use art, painting, accessories, lights, greenery, and carpet to stage the home, to give potential buyers a more attractive first impression of the property.Holmes, Tamara E.: \\"Home staging key to selling\\" Bankrate.com, Real Estate Guide 2010 They also rearrange or \\"temporarily replace\\" furniture. Properly executed staging leads the eye to attractive features, while down- playing flaws. Home staging is not without controversy: \\"rattled\\" was a NYTimes-cited reaction by a writer with a library room being told that \\"More than 50 percent of shelf space devoted to books equals clutter.\\" History =Sweden= In Sweden, professional home staging, known as homestyling, became popular after 2000. Professional home stagers claim homestyling yields around 10% higher pricing compared to just cleaning the home. =UK= In Britain, home staging is sometimes referred to as property presentation or property styling. The techniques were televised by home stylist Ann Maurice in the show House Doctor on Five for six years. and popularized the alternate description \\"house doctoring.\\" Her follow-up show is named House Doctor: Inside And Out. =U.S.= Home staged for resale - family room, kitchen The New York Times described the seller's situation as \\"... not always happily, in the company of unfamiliar sofas ... tables ...\\" while some of what they own is placed in temporary storage. However, U.S. research states that home staging can reduce a listing's time on the market by one third to half, and could fetch as much as 6% to 20% more than an empty home or a home not properly staged. Home staged for resale - nursery The pricing is not just for a one time dollar amount; high-end fees can be \\"$3,000 a month\\" (part of which is for renting replacement furniture). The practice of home staging has long elicited strong reactions. Agents and professional stagers point to examples like the Sarro-Waite apartment, and say staging can usually help a home sell faster, and for a higher price, offering a larger return on the investment. There is criticism on the fact that buyers will have to pay more for nothing, the furnitures aren't part of the sales. One 2018 professional view is that it's five years past simple decluttering and some light painting. Home staging services have sizable inventories of alternative chairs, current accessories and even pillows, blankets and towels. A decade prior, the simple view was that sellers believed in paid-for-staging, since it raised property values by reducing the home's perceived flaws. More recent changes now include depersonalizing, improving overall condition and even landscaping. For vacant homes, prop or staging furniture is used to create a living space where the buyer can imagine themselves living and also better understand the sizes of rooms. Prices for initial consultation and monthly follow-up fees vary by region and by the size of the property (including number of rooms).

It is located 12 kilometers west of Mildmay, 16 kilometers north of Wingham on County Road 4, and 25 kilometers southeast of Ripley on Bruce Road 6. The population in 2011 was 1,011. History Teeswater is located on the Teeswater River, a tributary of the Saugeen River. Surveyors named the river after the River Tees in England and the settlement was named for the river. The post office dates from 1855. The first settlers, mainly English and Scottish, arrived in 1856. Teeswater was incorporated as a village in 1875 and remained a separate municipality until it was amalgamated with Culross Township to form the Township of Teeswater-Culross in 1998. In 1999, Teeswater-Culross was itself amalgamated with the Township of Mildmay-Carrick to form the new municipality of South Bruce. Teeswater is the administrative centre of South Bruce and the largest community in the municipality. A weekly newspaper, The Teeswater News was published from 1871 until 1996. The building where the weekly newspaper was published burned down. Now in its place is The Kinsman Memorial park. The park was finished October 2008. Like many other Ontario villages, Teeswater nurtured a musical tradition as it grew, supporting first a string orchestra and a later a flourishing concert band. It is home to the prize-winning Teeswater Highlanders Pipes and Drums (established in 1961), which regularly presents concerts on the lawn beside the Town Hall. Churches Knox Presbyterian Church was built in the 1870s, and is now a continuing congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Another church of the same denomination, Westminster Presbyterian Church, burnt to the ground in the 1970s. Teeswater United Church was built in 1879 as the Wesleyan Methodist Church. It became the Teeswater Methodist Church in 1884, and since 1925 has been affiliated with the United Church of Canada. Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church was built around the same time as the two Protestant churches, and is located next to the school of the same name. In the past, Teeswater has been home to churches of the Anglican, Baptist, Pentecostal, Free Presbyterian, Episcopal Methodist, and Wesleyan Methodist faiths. Now there are only three churches: the Roman Catholic, United, and Presbyterian. Schools The village is currently home to two schools, Hillcrest Central Public School (Bluewater District School Board), and Sacred Heart Catholic School (Bruce-Grey Catholic District School Board and the middinight school east of teewater. Library Teeswater has the Bruce County Public Library, Teeswater branch. It is a Carnegie Library. Industry After years of stagnant growth Teeswater has recently begun to rebound as a result of a major new infrastructure project to replace homeowner septic systems with a community sewer system in Teeswater and Formosa. The population of Teeswater has remained fairly constant over the past 100 years at approximately 1100 (at a time when small towns and villages in the area have seen their populations shrink). This is due to fairly stable employment at major industries such as Bruce Power and innovative new farm industries such as goat farming. With the new infrastructure project due for completion in 2013 - 2014, Teeswater looks to renewed growth in the near and far future. =Home Hardware= The sign for Teeswater Home Hardware Teeswater once had a Home Hardware on the village's main street. This Home Hardware closed years ago, but the sign on the side of the building remains. =Grist Mills= Teeswater was a site of 2 commercial grist mills, Littles mill, and the Teeswater & district Co-op grist mill. Littles mill is still standing and is now a house, with the mill pond and river dam still in place. The co-op mill burnt down in 1976, and the dam taken out in about 1991. The pond location and dam bed can still be seen today. For many years before and after the mill burned down, children would go and play ice hockey on the frozen mill pond. The site of the co-op mill building is located near the Teeswater Creamery holding tank for spoiled milk. =Teeswater Creamery= Teeswater Creamery was first established in 1875, and has been a major provider of employment since then. It was run by Thompson Brothers from 1932 until 1981, when it was sold to Gay Lea Foods.\\"Gay Lea lays out dairy processing expansion plans\\".

From 1959 to 1969 he worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (then the National Bureau of Standards), and was a founding member of Alan Goldman‚Äôs newly created Operations Research Section in 1961. Goldman proved to be a crucial influence by enabling Edmonds to work in a RAND Corporation-sponsored workshop in Santa Monica, California. It is here that Edmonds first presented his findings on defining a class of algorithms that could run more efficiently. Most combinatorics scholars, during this time, were not focused on algorithms. However Edmonds was drawn to them and these initial investigations were key developments for his later work between matroids and optimization. He spent the years from 1961 to 1965 on the subject of NP versus P and in 1966 originated the conjectures NP ‚â† P and NP ‚à© coNP = P. Research Edmonds 1965 paper ‚ÄúPaths, Trees and Flowers‚Äù was a preeminent paper in initially suggesting the possibility of establishing a mathematical theory of efficient combinatorial algorithms. One of his earliest and notable contributions is the blossom algorithm for constructing maximum matchings on graphs, discovered in 1961 and published in 1965. This was the first polynomial-time algorithm for maximum matching in graphs. Its generalization to weighted graphs was a conceptual breakthrough in the use of linear programming ideas in combinatorial optimization. It sealed in the importance of there being proofs, or \\"witnesses\\", that the answer for an instance is yes and there being proofs, or \\"witnesses\\", that the answer for an instance is no. In this blossom algorithm paper, Edmonds also characterizes feasible problems as those solvable in polynomial time; this is one of the origins of the Cobham‚ÄìEdmonds thesis. A breakthrough of the Cobham‚ÄìEdmonds thesis, was defining the concept of polynomial time characterising the difference between a practical and an impractical algorithm (in modern terms, a tractable problem or intractable problem). Today, problems solvable in polynomial time are called the complexity class PTIME, or simply P. Edmond's paper ‚ÄúMaximum Matching and a Polyhedron with 0-1 Vertices‚Äù along with his previous work gave astonishing polynomial-time algorithms for the construction of maximum matchings. Most notably, these papers demonstrated how a good characterization of the polyhedron associated with a combinatorial optimization problem could lead, via the duality theory of linear programming, to the construction of an efficient algorithm for the solution of that problem. Additional landmark work of Edmonds is in the area of matroids. He found a polyhedral description for all spanning trees of a graph, and more generally for all independent sets of a matroid. Building on this, as a novel application of linear programming to discrete mathematics, he proved the matroid intersection theorem, a very general combinatorial min-max theorem. which, in modern terms, showed that the matroid intersection problem lay in both NP and co-NP. Edmonds is well known for his theorems on max-weight branching algorithms and packing edge-disjoint branchings and his work with Richard Karp on faster flow algorithms. The Edmonds‚ÄìGallai decomposition theorem describes finite graphs from the point of view of matchings. He introduced polymatroids, submodular flows with Richard Giles, and the terms clutter and blocker in the study of hypergraphs. A recurring theme in his work is to seek algorithms whose time complexity is polynomially bounded by their input size and bit-complexity. Career From 1969 on, with the exception of 1991‚Äì1993, he held a faculty position at the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Mathematics where his research encompassed combinatorial optimization problems and associated polyhedra. He supervised the doctoral work of a dozen students in this time. From 1991 to 1993, he was involved in a dispute (\\"the Edmonds affair\\") with the University of Waterloo,UW Gazette, October 7, 1992: CAUT called in on Jack Edmonds caseEditor's introduction , in: Kenneth Westhues, ed., Workplace Mobbing in Academe: Reports from Twenty Universities, Lewiston: NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2004 wherein the university claimed that a letter submitted constituted a letter of resignation, which Edmonds denied.University of Waterloo Daily Bulletin, March 5 2001: Conference honours Jack Edmonds The conflict was resolved in 1993, and he returned to the university. Edmonds retired from the University of Waterloo in 1999. Awards and Honors Edmonds was the 1985 recipient of the John von Neumann Theory Prize. In 2001 his paper, \\"Path, Trees and Flowers\\" was honoured as an Outstanding Publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in their celebratory edition of A Century of Excellence in Measurements Standards and Technology He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In 2006 the Queen of Denmark presented Edmonds with an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Southern Denmark. In 2014 he was honored as a Distinguished Scientist and inducted into the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Gallery. The fifth Aussois Workshop on Combinatorial Optimization in 2001 was dedicated to him.

Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) or electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is a geophysical technique for imaging sub-surface structures from electrical resistivity measurements made at the surface, or by electrodes in one or more boreholes. If the electrodes are suspended in the boreholes, deeper sections can be investigated. It is closely related to the medical imaging technique electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and mathematically is the same inverse problem. In contrast to medical EIT, however, ERT is essentially a direct current method. A related geophysical method, induced polarization (or spectral induced polarization), measures the transient response and aims to determine the subsurface chargeability properties.  History  The technique evolved from techniques of electrical prospecting that predate digital computers, where layers or anomalies were sought rather than images. Early work on the mathematical problem in the 1930s assumed a layered medium (see for example Langer, Slichter). Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov who is best known for his work on regularization of inverse problems also worked on this problem. He explains in detail how to solve the ERT problem in a simple case of 2-layered medium. During the 1940s, he collaborated with geophysicists and without the aid of computers they discovered large deposits of copper. As a result, they were awarded a State Prize of Soviet Union. Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov, the \\"father of ERT\\" When adequate computers became widely available, the inverse problem of ERT could be solved numerically. The work of Loke and Barker at Birmingham University was among the first such solution and their approach is still widely used. With the advancement in the field of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) from 1D to 2D and now-a- days 3D, ERT has explored many fields. The applications of ERT include fault investigation, ground water table investigation, soil moisture content determination and many others. In industrial process imaging ERT can be used in a similar fashion to medical EIT, to image the distribution of conductivity in mixing vessels and pipes. In this context it is usually called Electrical Resistance Tomography, emphasising the quantity that is measured rather than imaged.

It ran through the Catlins region in southwestern Otago and was built in sections between 1879 and 1915. It closed in 1971 except for the first four kilometres, which remain open as the Finegand Branch, formerly named the Finegand Industrial Siding. Along the line was the Hunts Road tunnel, the southernmost tunnel in New Zealand. Construction The line was built mainly to provide access to timber for logging companies, as access to the thickly wooded Catlins region was very difficult at the time. The first contract for construction was let on 29 April 1879, but it was not until 15 December 1885 that the first 12.79 km to Romahapa from the junction with the Main South Line in Balclutha were opened. The next stage to Glenomaru added approximately ten more kilometres to the line and opened on 7 July 1891. The opening of the following section was delayed by difficulties in boring the Hunts Road tunnel, and it was on 16 December 1895 that the branch was opened to Tahora. The present-day largest town in the district, Owaka, was reached on 22 June 1896, bringing the line to a length of 31.06 kilometres. Three years later, construction of the line recommenced, but the difficult terrain meant that it wasn't until 1 August 1904 that the next 5.5 km to Ratanui opened. Another five kilometres, another five years; Houipapa was reached on 17 December 1909. The line eventually reached its ultimate terminus of Tahakopa on 17 February 1915. There were proposals to extend the line to meet the Tokanui Branch, but these were little more than ploys by ambitious politicians. The rugged landscape proved to be a deterrent to serious extension plans and they were abandoned. Stations The following stations were on the Catlins River Branch (distance from the junction in brackets): *Finegand (3.6 km), current end of rails is just beyond the station site at the 4.05 km mark. *Otanomomo (6.46 km) *Romahapa (12.79 km), in the 1890s, a number of bush tramways operated in the immediate vicinity. *Glenomaru, second station (19.41 km) *Glenomaru, original station (22.79 km) *Hunts Road (25.93 km) *Tahora (29.23 km) *Owaka (31.06 km), in the 1890s, a number of bush tramways operated in the immediate vicinity. *Ratanui (36.65 km), also known as Catlins River and junction with bush tramway to sawmill owned by Goss & Co. *Houipapa (40.58 km), junction with Houipapa Sawmilling's bush tramway. *Tawanui (46.21 km), junction with Andrew Sharp Ltd's bush tramway; it was open by 1923 and closed in 1952. *Puketiro (52.14 km) *Caberfeidh (56.14 km) *Maclennan (60.75 km), junction with Maclennan Sawmilling Co.'s bush tramway; it was open by 1923 and closed by 1942. *Stuarts (64.07 km), junction with Latta Bros. bush tramway. *Campbell's Siding (?? km), junction with Leggatt and Campbell's bush tramway. *Tahakopa (68.44 km), junction with numerous bush tramways. All bush tramways were closed by the time the branch closed. Many were closed by 1942.  Operation  As the line was built, sawmills were established alongside it and extensive logging began of inland areas as only the coastal forests easily accessible by sea had been previously logged. Every station was located near at least one sawmill, and particularly in the line's first decades, they provided substantial freight traffic. Up to sixteen trains a week would operate, usually mixed trains that carried passengers as well as freight. On Tuesdays, the market day in the Catlins, a dedicated passenger service would run to Balclutha to connect with the express to Dunedin. Passenger traffic began to decline in the 1930s, and although it improved during World War II, the return of peace brought the return of the decline, and on 30 November 1958, passenger services on the line were cancelled. A couple of years previously, the locomotive depot in Tahakopa had closed on 12 August 1956. The local residents had strong feelings for their railway, and when the last Tahakopa-based engine, A 476, departed the isolated terminus, \\"Now Is the Hour\\" was sung and a wreath was placed on the locomotive. With the closure of the Tahakopa depot, trains began operating from Balclutha instead, and with the cessation of passenger services, a freight train ran thrice weekly to Tahakopa (on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays), and a fourth service ran as far as Owaka on Tuesdays. The sawmilling industry had been thriving in the 1930s, but three decades later, it was in sharp decline, and agricultural traffic for farms around Owaka had also fallen. The line was dieselised on 5 August 1968. Local residents protested the announcement of the line's closure in July 1970, but the railway administration stood firm and confirmed in October that the date of closure would be 27 February 1971. A number of final excursions were held, with the very last proving to be quite eventful. AB 795 (now preserved to run the Kingston Flyer) lost its sanding ability as it climbed from Owaka to Takahopa and therefore could not grip the rails. Although repairs were conducted at the terminus, the engine's firebox arch collapsed on the return journey and DJ 1243 had to run the train from Owaka back to Dunedin, finally arriving at 1 am the next morning. The line's closure did not affect the first four kilometres to Finegand, which remain open as an industrial siding to a freezing works. The branch today Although remnants of closed railways diminish and disappear as a result of both nature and human activity, the Catlins River Branch is a well-preserved line due to its isolated location. The Hunts Road tunnel is preserved by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and can be walked; the old railway's formation to the tunnel is quite visible at this point, as it is at many other locations along the line. Goods sheds and station buildings still stand in Maclennan, Romahapa (in this case, the station building has been resited), Takahopa, and Tawanui. Station buildings can also be found at Puketiro and Caberfeidh. In Takahopa, some rails are embedded in a road by the yard's former site, wheels from logging trolleys used on a bush tramway remain at the location of Stuart's yard, and the bridge over the Romahapa Creek continues to stand.

Machar's father, John Machar immigrated to Canada in 1827, and married Margaret Sim (a fellow Scottish immigrant) in Montreal in 1832. The couple established themselves in Kingston, Ontario (then part of Upper Canada), where her father was the pastor of St. Andrew's Church, and second principal of Queen's University (1846‚Äì1853). The couple's first child died in infancy; Agnes was born in 1837; and her brother, John Maule, in 1841. Apart from a brief stint at a boarding school in Montreal, Machar was educated by her father at home. By the age of ten Machar was studying Latin and Greek, instructed by her father and aided by his extensive library. Soon after she learned French, Greek and Italian. Machar moved in influential social circles, mingling with future prime minister John A. Macdonald, politicians like Richard John Cartwright, and professors at Queen's University such as George Romanes. At her summer home, Ferncliff, in Gananoque she hosted an array of international luminaries such as Daniel James Macdonnell and Emily Pauline Johnson. In 2015, Machar was named a person of national historic significance by the federal government. She has also been recognized by the Kingston Historical Society as a prominent woman in Kingston society. Machar was a prolific writer. Her first published book, Faithful Unto Death, was a memorial to a janitor at Queen's, published in 1859. Her 1870 novel, Katie Johnstone's Cross, won the Campbell's Prize (offered by Toronto publisher James Campbell and Son), and she won the same prize again the next year for Lucy Raymond. In 1874 she received another prize, this time for For King and Country, awarded by The Canadian Monthly and National Review; the novel is probably her best known work. Writing under her own name, and the pseudonym Fidelis, Machar published at least eight novels, a biography of her father, and many poems and essays. An anthology of her poetry, Lays of the \\"True North\\" and Other Canadian Poems was published in 1899, and she coauthored six historical works. Machar was called the \\"first of Dominion poetesses\\" by Sir Edwin Arnold. In 1887, she won the prize offered by the Week for the best poem on Queen Victoria's Jubilee. As an essayist, Machar frequently wrote about challenges faced by Christianity in the face of rapidly advancing scientific knowledge. Her friends included prominent Darwinists such as George Romanes and Grant Allen, and she wrote that Christians should accept evolutionary theory as part of an adapting and fuller understanding of God's word. Secularist William Dawson LeSueur, although he disagreed with her, praised her arguments. Machar also advocated for churches to deliver more charity to the poor, especially during the depressions of the late 19th century. She was particularly critical of the hypocrisy she saw where churches worked to save the souls of the poor, while disregarding their physical needs. She argued for justice, a right to work, and sufficient means to rise above a subsistence existence. Beyond her essays, she also explored these themes in her well-received 1892 novel, Roland Graeme, Knight. Machar also advocated for prohibition and proposed that the state should establish homes for the care of impoverished elderly citizens, whom she described as \\"veteran[s] in the industrial army.\\" She dedicated her own resources to this cause, bequeathing an endowment to establish the Agnes Maule Machar Home at 169 Earl Street in Kingston \\"for old ladies past earning their own livelihood.\\". The terms of her will turned the property, designed in 1849 by William Coverdale (architect), into a residence for elderly Protestant women of \\"gentle birth\\" in 1932, until its public sale in 2003. A witness to Confederation, Machar was concerned about English‚ÄìFrench tensions in the young country. She wrote poetry, fiction, and historical accounts of French achievements in Canada. She also wrote (unsuccessful) letters and essays pleading for clemency for Louis Riel, and, after World War I, compiled and translated letters from French soldiers who had died in the conflict. As a feminist, Machar argued in favour of higher education and fair working conditions for women. She advocated for better conditions for women and children in shops and factories, as well as for legislation requiring shorter hours for women workers. This last demand was challenged by fellow-feminist Carrie Matilda Derick who argued that it was inconsistent with the goal of gender equality. Machar was officially connected with the National Council of Women of Canada where she read many of her papers. Machar died in Kingston in 1927.

It is located in the City of Onkaparinga. The name refers to the town of Maslin Beach, the beach after which it was named and the suburb which contains both. In this article, the name refers to the suburb, unless stated otherwise. Geography Maslin Beach is located between Main South Road, which forms the suburbs eastern boundary, and Gulf St Vincent. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,066 persons in Maslin Beach on census night. Of these, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female. The majority of residents (68.8%) are of Australian birth, with other common census responses being England (15.8%) and New Zealand (2.2%). The age distribution of Maslin Beach residents is similar to that of the greater Australian population. 71.7% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 28.3% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. Community Local newspapers include The Times and On The Coast. On 18 April 2012, a 14-year-old boy from Aldinga died after falling 50 metres off a cliff at Maslin Beach Facilities and attractions =The beach= The most well- known attraction in the suburb is the beach at Maslin Beach. Also known as Maslin's Beach or, simply, Maslin's, the beach is the site of a cliff-lined recreation reserve stretching from Maslin Beach town in the north to Blanche Point in the south. In 1975, the southern half of the beach was declared Australia's first official nude beach. The beach is almost long, so the area reserved for nude bathing is away from other beach users. The Maslin Beach Nude Olympics are held annually, consisting of informal competitions such as three-legged races and the judging of \\"best bum\\". This is now called the Pilwarren Maslin Beach Nude Games. =Parks= There are three parks in Maslin Beach. One is at the top of the stairs, one is on Beachway Avenue and one is on Parkway Avenue located next to the town hall.  Development  The development of Maslins Beach and adjacent lands for prospective tourism and recreational facilities has been a subject of controversy. In 2014, the Onkaparinga Council rejected the prospect of rezoning lands for the potential development of a marina following objections from residents. The proponent lobbying for rezoning was Nobletech, represented by John Hunt. The Development Assessment Commission's agenda of 14 November 2013 noted that Nobletech wished to develop \\"a regional tourism hub to promote the natural environment and greater use of Maslin Beach.\\" Transportation =Roads= Maslin Beach is serviced by Main South Road, connecting the suburb to both Adelaide city centre and the Fleurieu Peninsula. =Public transport= Maslin Beach is serviced by public transport run by the Adelaide Metro.
