Early years  After a late ‚Äô60s period that saw him residing in Northern California and even attending the Altamont Speedway Free Festival in December 1969, Clic returned to his hometown of Hudson, Ohio and began playing guitar‚Äîeventually settling in with a local outfit called Bold Chicken (whose recordings were later documented on a Smog Veil Records release) in 1971. Upon the demise of Bold Chicken in 1973 and an aborted stint in a cover band, Clic hooked up with Hudson friend Rod Firestone and Donny Damage to form King Cobra. While King Cobra‚Äôs repertoire was mostly heavy metal and glam covers such as UFO, Alice Cooper and Silverhead, the band‚Äôs set list also featured Stooges and New York Dolls numbers‚Äîvirtually unheard of in the pre-punk mid-‚Äô70s.  Rubber City Rebels  Eventually the band‚Äôs punk inclinations won out. After witnessing Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers at the Piccadilly Inn in Cleveland in early 1976, Clic, Firestone and Damage scrapped the cover-band format in favor of originals. They soon took over a local Akron club called the Crypt, booking like-minded locals such as Devo (who also opened for King Cobra), Pere Ubu, the Bizarros and the Dead Boys. On the suggestion of Dead Boys singer Stiv Bators, King Cobra renamed themselves the Rubber City Rebels. The Crypt closed in early 1977, but the Rebels soldiered on, recording a critically acclaimed split-LP with the Bizarros called From Akron and building a live reputation. After sampling the New York scene with shows at CBGB, the Rebels moved to Hollywood, California near the end of the year and started gigging at venues such as the Masque, the Whisky and the Starwood. This led to a contract with Sire Records in 1978, which soon became embroiled in controversy as the band was dropped within months. After lineup changes and another year of building their club following, the Rebels landed a deal with Capitol thanks to band friend Doug Fieger of the Knack, who went on to produce their self-titled debut album, released in 1980. After Capitol rejected demos for a second album in early 1981, the Rubber City Rebels moved on to Elektra. But their association with the latter was even shorter, as the group was dropped after recording four songs for an album that never materialized. By 1982, the band was essentially finished, though sporadic reunion shows were undertaken later in the decade.  Solo and reunion years  Clic struck up a friendship with Phil Seymour (who had hits both with the Dwight Twilley Band and as a solo artist) in the ensuing years, which bore fruit on a self-released 1991 cassette-only album, Buzz Clic with Phil Seymour. However, the duo couldn‚Äôt find any takers among record labels, and Seymour died of cancer in 1993. Ultimately, the record would earn release when Smog Veil reissued it as a download and limited-edition CD titled California. Meanwhile, the 1990s saw a resurgence of interest in the Rubber City Rebels, whose songs were covered by underground punk acts like the Bobbyteens, the Candy Snatchers and the Raydios. By 2001, the Rebels were up and running again, playing select gigs in the United States, touring Europe three times and Japan once, and releasing the critically acclaimed 2003 album Pierce My Brain. The latter was released on Smog Veil Records thanks to label owner Frank Mauceri, who the Rebels met at a reunion gig. Smog Veil has also reissued the aforementioned Bold Chicken and Phil Seymour recordings, as well as two CDs by the Buzz Clic Adventure, Yadang (1998) and Escape from Bolivian (2011). While showing hints of the Rebels, Clic‚Äôs solo material is more rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll than punk. The Rubber City Rebels continue to gig and released a new Smog Veil single (‚ÄúAnnoyed, Destroyed, Unemployed‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúThe Ballad of the Rubber City Rebels‚Äù) in 2011, while Clic also plans to performs live with his latest project. A Bold Chicken 45 EP of 1972 studio recordings was released on Lysergic Sound Distributors in the fall of 2011, and in 2015, Clic released another solo album, Return from Nowhere.  Gear  Clic started his music career playing a Gibson SG through a 100-watt Marshall stack. Marshall remains his preferred amplification, though around 1974 he bought his first Gibson Flying V and has used the model almost exclusively since. For recording Clic uses various Gibson, Fender, Martin and Gretsch guitars and assorted vintage and boutique amps. His effects include various distortion pedals‚Äîwith the sound of an Ibanez Tubescreamer or modified Boss Blues Driver preferred.

Gosnell attended the University of Rochester, graduating summa cum laude in 1918. He went on to the University of Chicago, where in 1922 he received his doctorate. He became a professor at Chicago and taught there until 1941. During World War II, he went to Washington DC, as a budget analyst and later as an operations officer for the United States Department of State, while he continued to study and write on politics. He served in the federal government until 1960, and was on the faculty at American University. From 1962 to 1972, he was a professor of political science at Howard University. A student of political scientist Charles Edward Merriam, Gosnell published work in the 1920s that pioneered new approaches using psychology to examine voting and political behavior. His dissertation on New York politics, Thomas C. Platt (\\"Boss\\" Platt) and Theodore Roosevelt was published, and then Non-voting, Causes and Methods of Control (1924, with Merriam) and Getting out the Vote: An Experiment in the Stimulation of Voting (1927). In 1936, Gosnell won the first Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Negro Politicians: Rise of Negro Politics in Chicago. In the 1930s, he also wrote about machine politics in Chicago, and then in the 1960s revised his work in this area. During the Cold War, Gosnell studied the Soviet Union. Each year in honor of Gosnell's work, the Society for Political Methodology awards the Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology. The prize is given to the author(s) of the best work in political methodology, which has been presented at the political science conferences during the preceding year.

Background  Indonesia's control over the province of Papua has been disputed since 1963, when the country took control of the province from the Dutch. A separatist movement formed, battling the Indonesian government for more than four decades. During this time, one sixth of the province's population died in military operations. Papuans also cite economic issues, stating that the area's natural resources are exploited exclusively for the benefit of the national capital, Jakarta.  Biography  Buchtar studied engineering in Makassar, South Sulawesi. In 2008, he organized the International Parliamentarians for West Papua (IPWP), an organization devoted to repealing the Act of Free Choice, the 1969 referendum that had given Indonesia sovereignty over West Papua. He was arrested on 3 December 2008, in his house in near Jayapura, for organizing a 16 October protest supporting the launch of IPWP in the UK Parliament.Human Rights Watch. 2010. Prosecuting political aspiration: Indonesia's political prisoners. The following day, fifty protesters gathered outside the Jayapura police station to call for his release. Prosecutors sought a ten-year sentence against him on three charges: an act of treason (Article 106), provocation (Article 160), and acts against the state (Article 212). Buchtar's attorneys described the case as an attempt to stifle free speech in Papua, asking, \\"If outside Papua, people can freely raise their opinions, why is free speech still restrained in Papua, and treated as treason?\\" Amnesty International considered him to be a prisoner of conscience, \\"imprisoned solely for peacefully expressing [his] views\\". Human Rights Watch also lobbied for his release along with that of other non-violent Papuan political prisoners. In January 2011, Amnesty reported that Buchtar and fellow Papuan activist Filep Karma had been transferred from the Abepura prison to isolation cells at the Jayapura police station and were at risk of torture. Buchtar was released from prison on 17 August 2011.West Papua Media Alerts. 2011. Buchtar Tabuni released from prison. On 8 June 2012, Buchtar was arrested again in Jayapura on charges of organizing violent protests. On 23 July, another activist, Yusak Pakage, was arrested during Buchtar's trial for having a penknife in his bag.

Explicitly, it is given by the following short exact sequence of vector bundles over M: : 0 \\\\to P\\\\times_G \\\\mathfrak g\\\\to TP/G \\\\to TM\\\\to 0. It is named after Michael Atiyah, who introduced the construction to study the existence theory of complex analytic connections, and it has applications in gauge theory and mechanics. Direct construction For any fiber bundle P over a manifold M, with projection œÄ: P‚ÜíM, the differential dœÄ of œÄ defines a short exact sequence : 0 \\\\to VP \\\\to TP \\\\xrightarrow{d\\\\pi} \\\\pi^* TM\\\\to 0 of vector bundles over P, where the vertical bundle VP is the kernel of the differential projection. If P is a principal G-bundle, then the group G acts on the vector bundles in this sequence. The vertical bundle is isomorphic to the trivial g bundle over P, where g is the Lie algebra of G, and the quotient by the diagonal G action is the associated bundle P √óG g. The quotient by G of this exact sequence thus yields the Atiyah sequence of vector bundles over M. Lie groupoid viewpoint Any principal G-bundle P‚ÜíM has a gauge groupoid, whose objects are points of M, and whose morphisms are elements of the quotient of P√óP by the diagonal action of G, with source and target given by the two projections of M. The Lie algebroid of this Lie groupoid is the Atiyah algebroid. The space of sections of the Atiyah algebroid over M is the Lie algebra of G-invariant vector fields on P under Lie bracket, which is an extension of the Lie algebra of vector fields on M by the G-invariant vertical vector fields. In an algebraic or analytic context, it is more convenient to view the Atiyah algebroid as an exact sequence of sheaves of local sections of vector bundles.

History It was formed in February 1942 and was equipped with Hawker Furies released from 43 Squadron RAF but was disbanded seven months later in August 1942 and was never operationally deployed during the war. On 1 January 1951 the squadron was re- constituted at Bloemspruit as the Citizen Force element of 24 Squadron flying Harvards. In 1957 the squadron was assigned the role of presenting the Harvard Weapons Course and was split between permanent and citizen force flights. The Permanent Force Flight was responsible for the weapons course training, a role retained until 1970. In 1973 the unit was converted to Impala Mk I's and in November 1974 became the first squadron to be equipped with Impala Mk IIs. The squadron again reverted to a full Permanent Force staffing structure and was employed in the light attack role during the South African Border War.30mm cannons and capacity of up to 1 814 kg bombs or rocket pods (Williams (1997) pp.79) During this time, the squadron was one of the few Air Force squadrons to have a pilot honoured with the Honoris Crux Silver Medal, awarded to Maj.

In October 2017, Cook announced that he would not seek re-election in 2018. Early life and education Cook graduated from Navarro College, a community college, with an associate degree in 1974. Cook's father, the late Leland P. Cook, was the former circulation manager for the Corsicana Daily Sun. Leland left the newspaper to start a family business. In 1986, he and Cook founded Tradewest, a now-defunct video game company and licensee of several Nintendo games, including Double Dragon, Battletoads, and Super Off Road. Texas House of Representatives Cook served as the chairman of the Texas House State Affairs Committee and as a member of the Texas House Calendars Committee.

After investigation, the Hill County Election Administration Board and the Hill County Election Administrator declared that there was no voter fraud in the primary. McNutt ran again in the 2018 primary but lost the nomination to Cook's preferred successor, Cody Harris, who then prevailed in the general election, 36,471 votes (78.3 percent) to 10,136 (21.7 percent) for the Democrat Wesley D.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 14, 2010. The episode was written by Charles H. Eglee, Jack LoGiudice and Frank Darabont, the creator of the series. It was directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. In the episode, officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) finally reunites with his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), son Carl (Chandler Riggs) and best friend Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), although this reunion is short lived when he decides to return to Atlanta to rescue Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), along with Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), T-Dog (IronE Singleton), and Morales (Juan Pareja). After realizing that her husband is alive after all, Lori ends her tumultuous affair with Shane. That is when Shane takes out his frustration on the cruel and abusive Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). Plot Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) struggles to escape the handcuffs after his group abandoned him on the Atlanta department store's rooftop, swearing vengeance on Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) for putting him there. He starts to beg for God's forgiveness when walkers start trying to force open the rooftop door. Merle starts trying desperately to reach for some tools nearby, screaming that he will never beg to God again. Elsewhere, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) leads Rick and the other members of his group back to the survivors' camp outside Atlanta. Rick is overwhelmed to find his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs) among the survivors, along with his friend and partner Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal). As the group is reunited, they discover a walker nearby, which they quickly dispatch, though fear that this may be a sign of trouble as they had yet to see walkers anywhere near camp. Merle's brother Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) returns from hunting to learn of Merle's fate and becomes furious at Rick. Feeling guilty for leaving Merle handcuffed as well as wanting to retrieve his bag of guns, Rick arranges a rescue group, including Daryl. While Rick is gone, Lori tells Shane that with Rick back she must end her relationship with Shane, who then becomes bitter. When Shane witnesses Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich) striking his wife Carol (Melissa McBride) for not focusing on the laundry for the group, he takes his anger out on Ed severely and threatens to kill him if he ever touches any of the women in the group again. Meanwhile, Rick's group arrives back to the department store in Atlanta and make their way up to the rooftop, finding Merle apparently gone. However, they find a hacksaw sitting beside Merle's severed left hand within bloody handcuffs hanging from a pipe; Daryl goes into a fit of rage and screams as the others look on helplessly. Title reference The title reference echoes Lori's angry statement to Shane, \\"You can tell that to the frogs\\", made when she is uninterested in what he has to say. Daryl feels the same way when Rick, T-Dog, and others explain why Daryl's brother, Merle, was left handcuffed on the roof of the Atlanta department store. Production This episode marks the first appearance of several notable characters in the television series and from the graphic novels. This includes the abusive misogynist Ed Peletier, played by Adam Minarovich, the meek housewife, Carol Peletier, played by Melissa McBride, and her daughter, Sophia, played by Madison Lintz.

Best of all, it returned to the slower, more thoughtful pace of the pilot.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN also gave it a highly positive review, rating the episode 8.5 out of 10. Goldman called the episode a \\"big rebound from the somewhat lackluster second installment, offering a much more intense and engaging story.\\" =Ratings= Upon its initial broadcast on November 14, 2010, \\"Tell It to the Frogs\\" was watched by 5.07 million viewers, slightly increasing in viewers from the previous episode.

Morgan Surrender Site is the place where, during the American Civil War, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, the leader of Confederate troops responsible for Morgan's Raid, surrendered to Union troops following the Battle of Salineville. The site is located at a crossroads between the villages of Gavers and West Point in Columbiana County, Ohio, about 60 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1973 for its military significance. Morgan reportedly surrendered under what was called the \\"Surrender Tree\\". The location was at the northernmost point in which a Confederate command pierced Northern territory during the Civil War, except for the St. Albans Raid in Vermont. Morgan's Raid In June 1863, Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan took command of a force of 2,500 Confederate men in Kentucky. The purpose of the detachment was to recruit volunteers from the border state and to provide a distraction for Union General Ambrose Burnside who was planning an invasion of Tennessee. Morgan's superior, General Braxton Bragg, specifically ordered Morgan not to cross the Ohio river into Union territory. Morgan disobeyed his orders and, from June 11 to July 26, 1863, his troops conducted the Raid in an area that ranged from Tennessee to northern Ohio. Morgan ransacked the countryside and disrupted telegraph and railroad lines as he moved north. In Columbiana County, fears increased as Morgan's Raid approached. There were exaggerated reports that his force numbered as many as 10,000 men. The day before the surrender, residents of New Lisbon, Ohio, mobilized when they heard that Morgan was in Salineville in Columbiana County. The final armed engagement of the Raid occurred around 8 a.m. July 26 near the border of Carroll, Columbiana and Jefferson counties. As Morgan's troops approached, the New Lisbon militia dragged an old cannon from the Mexican War to block the road to town from the south. At around 11 a.m., word reached town that the rebels had routed the militia and were coming into the town. Though the report was false, the militia members at the cannon allowed Morgan's army to pass unchallenged because they were afraid to engage them. Morgan's Surrender Site of Morgan's surrender, sketched by Henry Howe from an 1886 photograph Morgan encountered Capt. James Burbeck, one of Lisbon's militia commanders, along the road. Morgan convinced Burbeck to allow him to surrender his command provided Burbick promised to take the sick and wounded soldiers and allow Morgan and his officers to be paroled so they could return home to Kentucky. However, Rue's troops gathered at Morgan's front and rear. Morgan sent a flag of truce with one of his officers to inform Rue that Morgan had already surrendered under favorable terms to Burbeck. Rue replied that he did not know who Captain Burbeck was and demanded that Morgan surrender to him immediately. An hour later, Gen. James Shackelford arrived and also talked surrender terms with Morgan. When informed of Burbick's parole of Morgan and his officers, Shackelford said it was \\"not only absurd and ridiculous, but unfair and illegal.\\" Until the end of his life, Shackleford took credit for capturing Morgan, since Rue was under his command. Rue also continued to take credit. In July and August 1863 Ohio Governor David Tod led an inquiry into Morgan's surrender. Governor Tod concluded that Captain Burbridge was actually James Burbick, a private citizen of New Lisbon, Ohio, who had never served as an officer in the Ohio Militia. As such, Governor Tod ruled that he had no authority over Morgan, and that Morgan‚Äôs surrender to Union forces stood. Morgan and more than 60 of his officers were imprisoned in the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus. On the night of Nov. 27, 1863, Morgan and six others escaped from the prison, with a plan originated by Thomas Hines.

He is most notable as a key witness in the Provisional Irish Republican Army assassination of Admiral of the Fleet The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and as the target himself of Irish criminal Martin Cahill. Career After gaining base science degrees in Ireland and training in Ireland, London, and the United States, he joined the civilian science service of the Garda S√≠och√°na. =Assassination of Lord Mountbatten= The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma usually holidayed at his summer home, Classiebawn Castle, in Mullaghmore, a small seaside village located on the coast of County Sligo in the west of Ireland. The village was only from County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, and near an area known to be used as a cross-border safe- haven by IRA members. Despite security advice and warnings from the Garda√≠, on 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten went lobster-potting and tuna-fishing in the wooden boat, the Shadow V, which had been moored in the harbour at Mullaghmore. IRA member Thomas McMahon had slipped onto the unguarded boat that night and attached a radio-controlled fifty-pound (23 kg) bomb. When Mountbatten was aboard en route to Donegal Bay, the bomb was detonated just a few hundred yards from the shore. It is not known who activated the radio- controlled bomb as McMahon had been arrested earlier at a Garda checkpoint between Longford and Granard. The boat was blown to pieces by the force of the blast. Mountbatten, then aged 79, was fatally wounded. He was pulled alive from the water by nearby fishermen, but died from his injuries before being brought to the shore.\\"BBC News On This Day: 27 August\\" Others killed by the blast were Nicholas Knatchbull, his elder daughter's 14-year-old son, and Paul Maxwell, a 15-year-old from Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, who was a crew member. The Dowager Lady Brabourne, his elder daughter's 83-year-old mother- in-law, was seriously injured in the explosion and died from her injuries the following day.Patton, Allyson, \\"Broadlands: Lord Mountbatten's Country Home\\", British Heritage March 2005, Vol. 26 Issue 1, pp. 14‚Äì17. McMahon was arrested by the Garda√≠ two hours before the bomb detonated, having been initially stopped on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle. He was tried for the murders in the Republic of Ireland, and convicted by forensic evidence supplied by Dr O'Donovan that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes.Telegraph, 9 Aug 2009 McMahon was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder on 23 November 1979, but was released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\\"1979 : IRA member sentenced for Mountbatten's assassination\\" This Day in History. Accessed 26 January 2007 =Assassination attempt by Martin Cahill= In January 1982, fearing the increasing role that forensic science could play in detecting his robberies, Martin Cahill had a bomb placed under the bonnet of the car of Dr. O'Donovan, at his Belgard, Dublin, home. Having suffered very serious but not life- threatening injuries, he was taken by ambulance to St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Suspicion of the plot immediately fell on both the IRA and the INLA, members of which Dr O'Donovan was due to give evidence against in the following weeks. However, evidence quickly pointed to an association with Cahill and, as a result, the Garda√≠ set up a Special Surveillance Unit (SSU), called the Tango Squad, to specifically target and monitor Cahill's gang on a permanent, 24/7 basis. Cahill was given the callsign Tango-1. In February 1988, a Today Tonight report identified Cahill as the man behind the O'Donovan bomb plot, the Beit robbery, and the robbery of O'Connors jewellery depot. Resultantly, PD leader Desmond O'Malley raised in the D√°il the revelations that Cahill owned such expensive property in Cowper Downs, despite having never worked, sarcastically remarking that Cahill must have needed the extra wall space to hang his artwork by the Dutch masters. In 1994, released on bail after the failed Lacey kidnapping, Cahill was assassinated by the IRA. Dr O'Donovan retired in 2002.

The plot centres around a Catholic priest who suffers a personal crisis when his sexuality is suddenly awakened. Unable to reconcile his deep conservative religious faith with his sexual obsession, he spirals into a path of self- punishment. The script was first offered to Pilar Miro.Bentley, A Companion to Spanish Cinema, p. 235 Plot Father Miguel is a conservative thirty six year old Catholic priest. In the changing Spain of 1966 Miguel's religious community tries to implement the doctrines given by the Second Vatican Council and adapt to the new realities of the country. Father Miguel opposes any form of religious modernization. He clashes with Father Luis, a fellow priest of his community who employs more modern tactics of religious instruction. Miguel begins to experience a personal crisis when his repressed sexuality is awaken by a road sign, displaying a beautiful woman wearing a provocative bikini. He begins to be constantly tormented by sexual thoughts. His sexuality is further aroused by Antonia, a beautiful married woman in her thirties, who in her confessions tells father Miguel about her intense sexual encounters with her husband. Antonia's confessions disturb father Miguel even more. He thinks about sex all the time to the point of impairing his work as a priest. In his disturbed state of mind, father Miguel seeks advice from the more worldly and modern father Luis. Miguel entered religious life at age fourteen and, unlike Father Luis, never had sexual experiences with women. However Miguel feels ashamed asking about sex and he tells Luis to forget the matter before revealing what is tormenting him. Alarmed by Miguel's behavior, father Alfonso, the leader of the congregation, separates father Miguel from normal services to the community. Antonia is given a new confessor while Miguel is placed in charge of classes at the local school. He begins to give religious instruction to children who are getting ready for their first communion. However, Miguel's sexual obsessions continue. Even the sight of one of the young boys playing with a pellet between his thighs brings sexual images to Miguel's mind. To calm down his sexual desires, Miguel resorts to penitence and self-flagellation punishing his own flesh with a cilice. This weakens his health. The boy is Antonia's son and Miguel sees her again during the child's first communion. Seeing her with her husband Miguel imagines Antonia having sex with her husband as she used to describe to him during confession. Miguel visits a bar, makes arrangements to have sex with a prostitute, but backs down at the last minute. He is so disturbed by his sexuality, he falls sick. Father Francisco sends him to recuperate at his native village where Miguel's widow mother still lives. Once in his hometown father Miguel begins to recover his strength. While visiting his mother, he walks across town and remembers events from his childhood. His irascible father who beat him merciless and the sexual adventures of his classmates, who went skinny dipping in a river, compared the size of their penises and had sex with a farm animal. Back in the city and his religious community things have changed. One of the priests had a girlfriend and has left the order to marry her. Miguel seems initially better but he is still tormented by constant sexual thoughts. He sees again Antonia whose marriage is not going well. She wants to divorce her husband. Miguel visits her at her house. Antonia tells him that all along she has been in love with him. Her confessions were aimed to arouse Miguel's interest. Miguel and Antonia have sex but he is overwhelmed by guilt for what he has done. During Christmas celebrations Miguel, tormented and deeply disturbed, locks himself in his room. He uses garden scissors to castrate himself. Miguel survives his castration. He is sent to a mental institution. Once deemed healthy again he returns to his community where many things have changed. He sees Antonia once again. She is now separated from her husband and would like to rekindle their relationship. Miguel tells her that is too late for that. Finally at ease, Miguel leaves his religious life and his community. He has lost his faith.

Populism has been a particularly strong phenomenon in Western Canada and in Quebec as promoted by the provincial Social Credit parties in the West and in Quebec and by the Social Credit Party of Canada and by the Reform Party of Canada. John Richards (1981) sees elements of populism in the following political movements: * the Liberal Party under Mackenzie (leader from 1873 to 1880) and Laurier (leader from 1887 to 1919) * Pattulo's British Columbia Liberal Party during the 1930s * Liberal Party of Ontario under Mitchell Hepburn (leader from 1930 to 1942) * the many socialist and labour parties leading up to the 1932 founding of the CCF * the Manitoba Liberal-Progressive Party * the Union Nationale in Quebec under Maurice Duplessis (leader from 1935 to 1959) * the early Diefenbaker Tory party * the federal NDP under Tommy Douglas (leader from 1961 to 1971) * to some extent, the Liberal Party of P. E. Trudeau (leader from 1968 to 1984) According to Panizza, Quebecois populism is largely intertwined in Quebec nationalism and thus has to be examined with its own ideological and linguistic dynamics taken into consideration.Panizza p. 174]  19th century  Anti-establishment populist politics became an important political force in 19th century Ontario amongst rural and working class political activists who were influenced by American populist radicals.Panizza, p. 174 Populism also became an important political force in Western Canada by the 1880s and 1890s. Populism was particularly strong in the form of farmer-labour coalition politics in the late 19th century.Panizza, p. 175  20th century  Multiple important populist political movements were formed throughout Canada in the 20th century. Western Canada and the Canadian Prairies in particular were the source of origin of a number of Canada's populist movements in the 20th century. The United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) and United Farmers of Saskatchewan (UFS) were formed by Prairie farmers that rejected party-dominated parliamentary representation advocated a quasi- syndicalist system of functional representation in a delegate democracy.Panizza, p. 176 The UFA governed the province of Alberta from 1921 to 1935. The Social Credit Party of Alberta led by William Aberhart promoted the principles of social credit economics alongside a right-wing populist agenda and the party governed Alberta from 1935 to 1971.Panizza, pp. 176‚Äì177 By the late 1930s with social credit financial reforms being unable to be carried out at the provincial level, Aberhart refocused the Alberta Social Credit party to attacking social welfare programs and state socialism.Panizza, p. 177 Ernest Manning took over the Alberta Social Credit party and office of Premier of Alberta from Aberhart and led the Alberta Social Credit party along a right-wing populist agenda that criticized both the social welfare programs and centralizing tendencies of the federal government of Canada. The Reform Party of Canada was a right-wing populist party that existed from 1987 to 2000.Panizza, p. 178 It was formed and led by Preston Manning, the son of former Social Credit Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. It was originally a Western Canadian protest party that captured the support of right-wing Western Canadians who were disillusioned with the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and in particular its preference for resolving the grievances of Quebec over the West. It also drew support of right-wing conservative Canadians who were dismayed by the Progressive Conservatives' inability to deliver their promised tax cuts and spending cuts. In 1993, the Reform Party made a political breakthrough in electing large numbers of members of parliament.  21st century  The federal political party, People's Party of Canada has been described as populist. Its leader Maxime Bernier refers to it as \\"smart populism\\" which is advocating for based on principles of freedom, responsibility, fairness, and respect, that speak for \\"all Canadians\\" and which do not appease special interest groups.

Various lines of Baguazhang claiming lineage to Ma Gui (but comprising different material) are still actively taught in China as well as in Japan, North America, and Europe. Biography Ma Gui's parents were originally from Laishui County, Hebei province but eventually relocated to Beijing where Ma Gui was born and raised. Ma Gui grew up to become a lumber merchant by trade and was nicknamed \\"Mu Ma\\" or \\"Lumber Ma\\". He was called this to differentiate himself from another prominent Bagua master, Ma Weiqi, who was in the coal business and hence nicknamed \\"Mei Ma\\" or \\"Coal Ma\\". Ma Gui was also called \\"Cuozi Ma\\" or \\"Little Ma\\" due to his short stature.Lu Shengli, Zhang Yun. Combat Techniques of Taiji, Xingyi and Bagua. Blue Snake Books, 2006 p. 92 =Introduction to Bagua at an early age= Ma Gui began studying Baguazhang at the age of twelve with Yin Fu and then with Dong Haichuan while still a teenager. Unlike many of Dong's top students, Yin Fu, Cheng Tinghua, and Ma Weiqi, who blended Bagua into their extensive martial arts background, Ma Gui had very little martial arts experience before studying Bagua and therefore was taught unique training fundamentals designed to develop Bagua fighting skills from the ground up. He remained steadfastly devoted to his two masters and trained with them exclusively throughout both of their lives. Like Dong's disciple Shi Shidong, Ma Gui helped house the elderly Dong Haichuan for several years until Dong's death in 1882. =Rigorous training and a conservative approach to teaching= Ma Gui advocated a rigorous approach to training with a heavy emphasis on developing extraordinary lower leg strength. According to current Ma Gui Style Baguazhang teacher Li Baohua, \\"The Baguazhang passed on by Ma Gui emphasizes the lower basin walking, so his lower legs were extremely thick. Lower basin walking means that the strength of the whole body is concentrated on the lower legs and feet, using the hidden strength of the bones and tendons. Ma Gui's lower legs were so developed that the shin bone was completely protected by tissue. He often had Liu Wanchuan (Li Baohua's grandmaster) look at his shins, and would occasionally allow people to hit them with wooden or iron staffs.\\" Ma Gui would often wear a sand filled jacket on his body or a sand filled belt around his waist or legs for strength training and would also attach ropes on nearby trees to make a netting, and then train under the netting. The netting would ensure that he stayed low. Ma Gui was also known to demonstrate his strength by Bagua circle walking underneath a three foot high table. While an impressive feat, the majority of Ma Gui's leg training was not done through walking at such an extremely low level, but rather was cultivated by countless hours of his system's \\"bear walking:\\" slow concentrated circle-walking in a horse stance that dramatically transforms the large tendon lines from neck to feet and strengthens the entire body.Andrea Falk. North American Ma Gui Ba Gua Association Training Manual for Baguazhang, 2nd Edition. Andrea Mary Falk, 2010 p. 9 Ma Gui was most famous for his devastating fighting technique called the \\"zhibi wanda\\"‚Äîa wrist strike with a straightened arm. According to third generation Yin Style Baguazhang master He Puren, \\"In order to practice his wrist-striking, he would do a press-up style exercise that involved him falling forward onto the floor onto the back of his wrists and then springing back up to a standing position, which he would practice repeatedly and could do with ease. He had bested many famous masters using only his wrist-striking. You couldn't touch his body, if you did it felt like being electrocuted.\\" To further strengthen this technique Ma was also known to practice with ten-pound iron rings on each wrist. Ma Gui had a reputation for being an extremely conservative teacher who demanded the very best of his students. As a busy lumber merchant he did not have to teach professionally and he was therefore able to maintain extremely high standards in training. Fiercely dedicated to the traditional way he had been taught Bagua by Yin Fu and Dong Haichuan, he refused to modify his teachings to make them easier and felt that \\"anyone who felt the skill was too difficult to learn should not be taught in the first place.\\" =A Leader of the Third Bagua Generation= Ma Gui Standing with Fellow Bagua Students at Dong Haichuan's Tomb (Ma Gui is third from the right of the headstone with the long beard and black hat). While Ma Gui's conservative teaching approach turned away many students, he was still highly sought after as an instructor. He was hired as the martial arts instructor for the son of Qing Dynasty Prince Duan early in his career. His reputation only grew over time, and after surviving both the turmoil of the Boxer Rebellion and later the Xinhai Revolution, he eventually became a martial arts instructor at the National Police School in 1919. In 1930, following in his teacher Yin Fu's footsteps he erected in 1930 a third commemorative stele on Dong Haichuan's gravesite. As the leader of the third generation of Bagua students, he offered the following words for future generations: > Dong left us happiness and long age as lasting mountains from the land of > Chinese Traditions. May his art shine and expand in our nation. He had an > incredible strength and was involved in the education of his country. He was > trying to bring happiness by elevating to the origin of everything. =Teaching increases in old age= While still highly conservative in his teaching, Ma Gui began to teach more openly to students in his seventies after his lumber business began to fail and he needed financial support. Among the prominent students whom Ma Gui taught in his later years were Li Shao'an (1888‚Äì1982), and his business partner Liu Wanchuan (1905‚Äì1993),Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan master Wang Peisheng (1919‚Äì2004), and Liu Hung Chieh (1905‚Äì1986). In his advanced age, Ma Gui also imparted special teachings from Dong Haichuan on meditation and energy work, including Dong's special \\"internal dantian\\" practice. According to Liu Hung Chieh's student Bruce Frantzis, \\"Ma Shr Ching told Liu how Dong had taught. Dong frequently would sit with his eyes closed, describe every motion Ma was making, and tell him to adjust it one way or another. Dong used to sit and meditate for hours every day. The basis of his martial power, at least according to Ma, was at least as much due to his sitting practices, which were pure Taoist meditation, as to his martial arts techniques.\\"Bruce Frantzis. Power of Internal Martial Arts: Combat Secrets of Ba Gua, Tai Chi, and Hsing-I. North Atlantic Books, 1998 p. 345 Ma Gui continued to train extremely hard well into his golden years and for sparring was said to favor the triple chuanzhang (spearing palm), another famous technique that Ma Gui perfected. According to Li Baohua, \\"When Ma Gui was in his 80s he would still train the triple chuanzhang. To Liu Wanchuan, watching from the side, Ma Gui's body looked very light, as if his feet did not even touch the ground.\\" =Ma Gui's legacy= Ma Gui's decision to teach more seriously later in life meant that only a rare few actually carried on the full extent of his knowledge. Many third and fourth generation Baguazhang fighters were influenced by Ma Gui's teachings but only received bits of his knowledge. Today there are only two known lineages that can be said to have received the full transmission of his martial arts teachings‚Äîthe schools of Liu Wanchuan and Wang Peisheng. Liu Wanchuan's lineage is being taught through the Magui Baguazhang Promotion Center, and its many teachers around the globe. Wang Peisheng's lineage is being taught by the Yin Cheng Gong Fa Association. However, the material taught by both lines are dissimilar‚ÄîLiu Wanchuan's material includes 8 animals, an 88 movement routine, a 128 movement routine, partner drills, and other material; Wang Peisheng's material includes luohanquan, 64 palms, and the 18 intercepting sabers from Ma.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 21, 2010. The episode was written by Robert Kirkman and Elvis Jasso Mar√≠n, and directed by Johan Renck. In the episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Theodore \\"T-Dog\\" Douglas (IronE Singleton), and Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) return to downtown Atlanta in search of Daryl's brother, Merle. The group are later targeted by a Latino gang, whose leader threatens to kill them if they do not relinquish their weapons. Meanwhile, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal)'s relationship begins to crumble. Major events in \\"Vatos\\" include the deaths of several recurring characters, including Amy (Emma Bell) and Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). This episode was filmed in several locations in Atlanta, Georgia, including the Goat Farm Arts Center. \\"Vatos\\" was lauded by television commentators, who praised its storyline progression and character development. Upon initial airing, it attained 4.75 million viewers and a 2.4/6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode became the highest-rated cable program of the day, as well as the ninth most- watched cable program of the week. Plot The episode opens as sisters Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Amy (Emma Bell) are fishing for the survivors in a nearby quarry lake, discussing their childhood and hopes that Florida, where their parents live, was not hit as hard by the zombie epidemic. In Atlanta, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) have discovered the severed hand of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), Daryl's brother, where Rick had handcuffed him on the roof of a store. They follow a trail of blood to show Merle had killed some walkers and managed to cauterize the stump of his hand before the trail goes cold. At the survivors' camp, Jim (Andrew Rothenberg) begins digging holes, refusing to explain why. As the survivors press him, he lashes back at them, forcing Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) to restrain Jim. Jim breaks down, explaining how he lost his family to walkers, and that a dream inspired him to dig the holes. Jim warns Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) to keep her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) safe. In Atlanta, Rick's group gets into conflict with the Vatos, a group of Latinos that kidnap Glenn and demand they exchange Rick's bag of weapons for his return. When they face-off at the Vatos' base, they discover it is a hidden nursing home, and the Vatos are only trying to protect their own family. Rick leaves some of his weapons and ammo for the Vatos, and Glenn is returned unharmed. Rick's group finds their vehicle missing, and suspect Merle took it seeking vengeance on the survivors', and they start to race on foot back to the camp. At the camp, the other survivors are enjoying dinner when a horde of walkers suddenly appear, biting several of the members including Amy and Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). Rick and the others arrive in time to quell the walkers. Amy dies in Andrea's arms, and as the others stand around in shock, Jim recalls why he had dug those holes. Production Filming for the episode commenced in several locations throughout Atlanta, including the Goat Farm Arts Center. \\"Vatos\\" was directed by Johan Renck and written by Robert Kirkman; this episode became Kirkman's first writing credit for the series. \\"I was pretty happy that the first death in the show was in an episode that I got to write,\\" he stated. \\"That was kind of cool.\\" The episode's script was heavily modified by Kirkman and series creator Frank Darabont prior to airing. Neil Brown, Jr. initially collaborated with producers on directing the episode but eventually pulled out of the project. Principal photography for the episode transpired at the Goat Farm Arts Center in the West Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. \\"Vatos\\" features a sequence near the conclusion of the episode, in which a horde of walkers invades and attacks the campgrounds. The scene was written by Robert Kirkman, who based it closely on a similar sequence in the comics. Kirkman stated that he was very excited to develop the sequence and added that it was a familiar task for him: > It was very exciting. I got to write the attack at the end of the > episode‚Äîwhich was very much something that happened in the comic book > series‚Äîso I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But > as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to > all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was > great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting > something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. > It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and > getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the > show, despite the fact that he‚Äôs not in the comic book. It was a blast. Alongside the main cast, the episode introduced Vatos band, composed by Neil Brown Jr. as Guillermo, Noel G. as Felipe, Anthony Guajardo as Miguel, Gina Morelli as Abuela, and James Gonzaba as Jorge. The rest of the gang is formed by Roger Herrera and Timothy Douglas Perez. This episode marked the last regular appearance of Emma Bell (Amy), whose character was killed off in the conclusion of the installment. Her death is considered one of the twentieth most shocking deaths in the series. Greg Nicotero, the show's production designer, enacted the walker who bites Amy. Bell stated that Nicotero placed a skin-colored prosthetic around her neck, which consisted of a layer of red viscous liquid and a hose. Once it was bitten into, the prosthetic exploded and resembled a severe flesh wound. Kirkman expressed that it was difficult for him to remove Bell from the cast but was thankful that she understood she would only be limited to a certain number of episodes; he stated: > It's something that's very difficult for me. Because it is lines on paper > when I do it in the comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard > [...] doesn‚Äôt have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is > dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these > actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two > of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed > that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad > for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I would have liked to have had > her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have > got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the > understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes > and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it > doesn‚Äôt really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I > had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn‚Äôt actually there for when she died. > But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about > having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when > you're doing a TV show and it‚Äôs a little upsetting to have to get rid of > somebody. A deleted scene shows Rick and crew revisiting the Vatos, but finds everyone dead, including the old people. Another gang had overrun the Vatos, killed everyone inside, and stolen their food and supplies Reception =Ratings= \\"Vatos\\" originally aired on November 21, 2010 in the United States on AMC. The episode attained 4.75 million viewers upon airing, and garnered a 2.7/4 HH rating. Additionally, it received a 2.4/6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. \\"Vatos\\" became the highest- rated cable program of the night, and the ninth most-watched cable program of the week. Ratings and total viewership for the episode moderately declined from the preceding installment, \\"Tell It to the Frogs\\", which was watched by 5.07 million viewers and a 2.5/7 rating in the 18-49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode received 467,000 viewers and became the highest- rated cable program on FX of the week dated November 28. =Critical response= \\"Vatos\\" attained general acclaim from television critics. James Poniewozik of TIME asserted that the episode successfully made the viewers experience the daily life of the show's characters, and HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt that \\"Vatos\\" was the strongest episode since the series' pilot episode. In his 7.9 out of 10 star review, Josh Jackson of Paste wrote: \\"The whole spectrum of human nature is on view when civilization is stripped away‚Äîthe bigger the immediate threat, the more varied the response. And it‚Äôs this balance between action/horror and personal drama that makes The Walking Dead so compelling.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Gina McIntyre felt that Kirkman \\"seemed right at home adapting his characters for the screen.\\" John Griffiths, writing for Us Weekly, felt the installment was haunting enough to \\"make viewers leave their lights on afterward\\", and opined that the character development and the progression of the storylines served as the episode's highlights. John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press stated that \\"Vatos\\" was the most emotionally poignant episode of The Walking Dead so far. Expressing similar sentiments, IGN's Eric Goldman evaluated the episode as \\"strong\\", ultimately giving it a nine out of ten, signifying an \\"amazing\\" rating. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club, who issued the episode a B grade, was less enthusiastic than the general consensus. Pierce felt that the bulk of the episode was \\"mushy\\" and concluded that it \\"didn't solve anything involving the ongoing plot and introduced a bunch of arbitrary, needless complications that had no payoff, [and] bogged it down quite a bit.\\" Critics praised the interactions between Amy and Andrea. Serba asserted that Kirkman effectively set up Amy's death at the beginning of the episode, and added that it established a sisterly bond. Serba also acclaimed Laurie Holden's performance; he stated that she \\"powerfully conveys her grief and despair.\\" Pierce avouched that the opening sequence was likable, while Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal summated that the concluding scene was \\"an emotional release after a tense build-up.\\" Critics were divided about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, as well as his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic compared Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: \\"So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free,\\" he said. Pierce opined: \\"Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the- week show. Since nothing ends up coming of it from a plot standpoint [...], it's hard not to think of it as one of those comics where two have a big fight scene that turns out to be mistaken identity.\\" References External links *\\"Vatos\\" at AMC Deleted scene what happened to the Vatos Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 1) episodes ","title":"Vatos"},{"id":"33272880","text":"Martin Lewis, (born 8 September 1888 ‚Äì died 1 April 1970), was an English actor.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 28, 2010. The episode was written by Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson. In the episode, the survivors deal with the aftermath of the walker attack, and decide to move to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities, hoping to find a cure for an infected Jim (Andrew Rothenberg). Meanwhile, Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), finding his leadership position challenged by Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), succumbs to his inner demons. Plot The survivors deal with the aftermath of the zombie attack, burying their dead and burning the bodies of the zombies. Andrea stays with the body of Amy, apologizing for not spending more time with her, before the body starts to re-animate and she shoots it in the head. As they reassess their situation, Jim reveals he was bitten in the attack, and while Daryl Dixon wants to kill him before he turns, Rick Grimes stops him, telling him they don't kill the living. Daryl points out the hypocrisy after Rick points a gun at him. Fearing the camp is no longer safe, Rick suggests the group travel to the CDC facility in Druid Hills, Georgia where they may have a cure. Shane does not believe it is safe, and tries to convince Lori, Rick's wife, to change Rick's mind, but she refuses. Shane, still resenting Rick's reappearance disrupting his relationship with Lori, attempts to shoot Rick but stops when Dale spots him. The camp packs up, with Rick radioing Morgan Jones that Atlanta is not safe. Morales and his family elect to go on their own towards Birmingham, and Rick gives them some of the weapons and supplies. The remainder of the survivors heads to the CDC. En route, as they fix Dale's RV, Jim starts to feel as if he is about to turn and asks to be left behind; the group leaves him under a tree by the road. At the CDC, a lone scientist, Edwin Jenner, is sampling tissue that is part of the \\"Wildfire\\" epidemic that has lasted for over 190 days. During one test, his biohazard protection suit is damaged, and he quickly takes emergency precautions, which destroy the remaining samples he has to study. With no further means to proceed, Jenner contemplates suicide when he sees Rick's group appear outside the sealed building. Rick sees surveillance cameras watching them, and demands they be let in before an approaching horde of zombies reach them. Jenner triggers the external doors, allowing Rick's group in to safety. Production Filming for \\"Wildfire\\" commenced at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre. \\"Wildfire\\" was directed by Ernest Dickerson and written by Glen Mazzara. Actor Noah Emmerich made a guest appearance on the show, portraying the character of Edwin Jenner, one of the few remaining medical personnel dedicated to eradicating the virus. Emmerich's appearance was formally announced in November 2010. Creator Frank Darabont foreshadowed the development of the episode the same month, alongside predecessor \\"Vatos\\" and the first season finale, \\"TS-19\\". \\"Before it's all said and done, the opinions and actions of the group are divided.\\" Producer Gale Anne Hurd added, \\"Stakes are higher, dissension develops, rivalries intensify.\\" Principal photography for \\"Wildfire\\" transpired at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, which was depicted as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Producers of the show were not allowed to photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. As opposed to the successive episode, where filming mostly took place inside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for \\"Wildfire\\" occurred outside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as its headquarters are in close proximity to Atlanta. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Kirkman was content with the idea, and stated that Darabont was looking to diverge from the comics in lieu of a literal interpretation. \\"Frank has always maintained that the comic book is a path but we‚Äôre not stuck on it. If a story idea comes up, we‚Äôll leave the path for an episode or two, but we‚Äôll always come back to it,\\" he said. In \\"Wildfire\\", Andrea shoots her deceased sister Amy after she slowly resurrected into a walker. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, made Bell wear contact lenses that were less harsh in appearance, as he wanted an emotional connection to resonate between the characters. Bell admitted that she was perplexed on how to approach the scene. \\"I laid down on the wood chips and just sort of stared at the sky and staring at my sister's face,\\" explained Bell. \\"All of these thoughts and emotions started flooding in, so I was really lucky.\\" Note: Event occurs at time 24:45‚Äì26:56. Jim, played by Andrew Rothenberg, also died in this episode, bitten by a walker, and is abandoned. His death is considered the 35th most important death in the series. Adam Minarovich played Ed, Carol's husband and first victim of the series. It is the last appearance of Morales, played by Juan Pareja, and his family (Maddie Lomax and Noah Lomax as Eliza and Louis Morales, his children, and Viviana Chavez as Miranda Morales, his spouse), until his return in the season 8 episode 2 named The Damned. Bear McCreary composed fewer scores in \\"Wildfire\\" in comparison to other episode of the series, putting an emphasis on silence, which McCreary felt that the music was more subtle when corresponding with silence. He found that as a result, the music was more effective because he was not adding sound \\"for the sake of being heard\\". \\"When you don't have ambient beds going through your whole score,\\" he said, \\"it means that just the entrance of music has a lot more power. We really pushed the limits of how long can we go without music.\\" Themes and cultural references Ideas relating to guilt recur throughout the episode. Proclaiming \\"Wildfire\\" as an installment \\"full of guilt trips\\", Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly explained that Rick Grimes and Andrea epitomized such themes given their situations. \\"Andrea feels guilty about 'not being there' for Amy‚Äîbut is motivated towards a mercy. Shane made Rick feel bad for not being at the camp when the zombies attacked, and Lori didn't do much to make her husband feel better,\\" Snierson stated. \\"She also told Rick she needs more 'certainties' from him than decisions made from hunch and instinct.\\" A columnist for the same publication, Jeff Jensen stated that \\"Wildfire\\" was a commentary on humanity, and added that the episode demonstrated \\"the need for the group to honor the departed\\" so they could identify with their humanity. The title of the episode is an homage to Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, which also involves studying a pathogen in an underground laboratory. Reception =Critical response= Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave it a grade of A- on a F to A scale, calling the episode \\"a very good one, gripping as hell and maybe my favorite episode of the season so far.\\" He also complimented the directing of Ernest Dickerson, saying he \\"provided some fantastic shot set-ups and used the 16mm camera better than anyone has so far.\\" Overall, he commented, \\"The episode provided a lot of emotional drama, and while it was somewhat light on zombie action, it did deliver a huge rush of action thrills at the end. It's stripping down the characters to the point where their relationships are becoming more meaningful, and it's introduced a real wild card at just the right time.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8 out of 10. =Ratings= Upon its initial broadcast on November 28, 2010, \\"Wildfire\\" was watched by 5.56 million viewers, which increased in viewership from the previous episode. At the time, it was the highest-rated episode of the series in both overall viewership and in the 18-49 demographic.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on December 5, 2010. The episode was written by Adam Fierro and series creator Frank Darabont and directed by Guy Ferland. In the episode, the group finally finds safe haven in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters, although the only scientist there, Dr. Edwin Jenner (Noah Emmerich) hides many secrets that leads the group to demand answers about the zombie apocalypse. Themes such as romance, rape, suicide and terror are prevalent throughout \\"TS-19\\". Different character developments occur throughout the episode, particularly with Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), who writer Robert Kirkman felt that viewers would no longer identify as the show's main antagonist. Production for \\"TS-19\\" commenced at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, as opposed to the actual headquarters for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which was impractical due to the high security of the area. \\"TS-19\\" received favorable reception from television commentators, who praised the development of various characters as well as the performances of several actors and actresses. Upon airing, it attained 5.97 million viewers and a 3.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen Media Research. \\"TS-19\\" at one point was the show's highest-rated episode, and it is the highest-rated telecast in its first season. Plot The episode opens with a flashback where Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) ensures that the still-unconscious Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is secured within the hospital during the onset of the zombie apocalypse. In the present, Rick's group has entered the CDC building in Atlanta with help from its sole remaining scientist, Dr. Edwin Jenner (Noah Emmerich). Jenner makes them undertake a blood test to prove they are not infected. The group enjoys the luxuries of the facility, which is self-powered and still has running water, food, alcohol, and other amenities. Jenner admits he is the only researcher that stayed behind, many of the others having left for their families or committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck. Jenner later shows Rick's group what he had learned from Test Subject 19, who had been his wife but volunteered to be recorded after she was bitten in hopes of discovering a cure; the infection kills the carrier but causes the brain to re-activate and re-animate the body shortly thereafter, eliminating any conscious human traits. Jenner had been in communication with other facilities worldwide before they went silent, knowing the French had been close to a cure, but affirms that human civilization is ceasing to exist. The group discovers that the generator's fuel reserves are near exhausted; when empty, the facility will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed to destroy the facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner open the doors, and Rick eventually convinces him to allow them to at least try to overcome the tragedy rather than be forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction. The surviving members return to their vehicles and set off away from the smoking husk of the CDC. Production Noah Emmerich made a guest appearance in the episode as Dr. Edwin Jenner. \\"TS-19\\" was directed by Guy Ferland and written by Frank Darabont and Adam Fierro. Actor Noah Emmerich made a guest appearance on the show, portraying the character of Edwin Jenner, one of the few remaining medical personnel dedicated to eradicating the virus. Emmerich's appearance was formally announced in November 2010. Darabont foreshadowed the development of the episode the same month, alongside predecessors \\"Vatos\\" and \\"Wildfire\\". \\"Before it's all said and done, the opinions and actions of the group are divided.\\" Producer Gale Anne Hurd added, \\"Stakes are higher, dissension develops, rivalries intensify.\\" Principal photography for \\"TS-19\\" transpired at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, which was depicted as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Producers of the show were not allowed to photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt that it was important to add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. Note: Event occurs at time 26:04‚Äì28:28. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for \\"TS-19\\" occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\"When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would come out of that story, the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, I was very much picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff,\\" stated creator Robert Kirkman. \\"That's one of the reasons I was so on board with the idea.\\" At the episode's conclusion, Jenner purposely calls for the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded with the collapse of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While his group escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about the virus that has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no indication as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. \\"I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it,\\" said Andrew Lincoln, \\"because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it [as a mystery]‚Äîit's perfect, it's so classy.\\" Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. \\"I thought it was a great addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [for the zombies] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it,\\" he stated. \\"It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit.\\" It is not until the second season finale, \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group. In a 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Robert Kirkman revealed that he regrets revealing that everyone in the new world is infected too soon, saying \\"If I had to do it again, I wouldn't have done the CDC episode [at the end of season one]. It possibly gave away too much information and was such a big change very early on in the series.\\" =Cast= Alongside the main cast, it supposed the last appearance of Jacqui, played by Jeryl Prescott, who died at the CDC with Dr. Edwin Jenner, played by Noah Emmerich. Claire Bronson played Candace Jenner, who worked with Edwin Jenner at the CDC before being infected and killed. Barry Hopkins played a hospital patient. Joyce Liles, Ken Melde, M.V.

Themes and cultural references Near the end of the episode, Bob Dylan's \\"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\\" (1971) is heard in the background. Ideas alluding to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in \\"TS-19\\", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted with the decision to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital‚Äîwho Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by the ending of the episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. \\"Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her,\\" said Kirkman. \\"The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead.\\" Lincoln said of the flashback: \\"You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man‚Äîand also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed‚Äîeverybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind.\\" Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror. The character progression of Shane is a focal point in \\"TS-19\\". After facing constant rejection from Lori through much of the previous three episodes, he has become more agitated and impatient with her. According to Kirkman, it was important to integrate dimension to the character so that viewers \\"can see later in the episode, when [Shane] is losing it and actually getting somewhat violent with Lori, the transition he's gone through and how this world has changed him from being a loving, easygoing guy into this guy who is slowly devolving into a bit of a maniac.\\" The show features various references relating to music, media, film, and other pop cultural phenomenon. Character Dr. Edwin Jenner was modeled after the English physician Edward Jenner, a pioneer in the eradication of smallpox. The episode title is an acronym for Test Subject 19, a patient that was examined by Jenner for clinical research. As \\"TS-19\\" comes to a close, one can hear the song \\"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\\" (1971) by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan play in the background. The Washington Post Liz Kelly suggested that it could have referred to the seemingly long hiatus that proceeded after the season finale. Jenner later reveals to the group that the symptoms of the walker virus are evocative to that of meningitis. As Rick desperately tries to break out of a nearly incinerating Centers for Disease Control and Prevention building, Carol hands him a grenade, which was the same grenade that Rick had found in a tank in the series premiere, \\"Days Gone Bye\\". The opening and concluding scenes of \\"TS-19\\" are reminiscent of the American television series Lost. Reception =Ratings= \\"TS-19\\" was originally broadcast on December 5, 2010 in the United States on AMC. Upon initial airing, the episode amassed 5.97 million viewers and a 4.1 household rating, indicating that 4.1% of households that watched television viewed the episode. Following two encore presentations, total viewership accumulated to 8.1 million. At the time of its airing, \\"TS-19\\" was the highest-rated cable television series of all time demographically; it attained a 3.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic, denoting 4 million viewers, while simultaneous acquiring 3.5 million viewers in the 25‚Äì54 demographic according to Nielsen Media Research. The accolade was then succeeded by three episodes of The Walking Dead: the episode's ratings were beaten by second season premiere \\"What Lies Ahead\\", followed by \\"Nebraska\\", and lastly the second season finale \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\", of which the last aforementioned currently holds the record. \\"TS-19\\" became the most-viewed cable telecast of the day, obtaining significantly higher ratings than installments of Hannah Montana and Shake It Up on Disney Channel. Ratings and total viewership moderately increased from the previous installment, \\"Wildfire\\", which received 5.56 million viewers and a 2.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, \\"TS-19\\" garnered 492,000 viewers, subsequently becoming the most-viewed television series of the week on FX. =Critical response= \\"TS-19\\" garnered favorable reviews from most television critics. In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that the episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told \\"a compelling, intense story within its hour\\" albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"The first season of The Walking Dead doesn‚Äôt exactly end on an optimistic note, but our heroes are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC.\\" Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that \\"almost and everyone's still kind of in the dark\\", and Kelly stated that \\"TS-19\\" came to an \\"abrupt, explosive end\\". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode as well as the varying political themes covered; \\"After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by \\"TS-19\\", and asserted that the conclusion \\"resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that as long as they were alive, at least there was a chance of a tomorrow.\\" Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, \\"Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway.\\" Some commentators were less enthusiastic about the episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared \\"TS-19\\" a \\"compelling hour\\", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. \\"While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action,\\" explained Wigler, \\"not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution.\\" Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that in contrast to a \\"great season\\", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that \\"this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched\\". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued \\"TS-19\\" a B‚Äì grade: despite proclaiming that \\"there was some good stuff\\" in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode‚Äînotably the explosion sequence‚Äîas he felt it was a waste of cinematography. \\"The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people looking at one another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would have lived through it.\\" Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that it was an interesting episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner. The character progression of several characters and the performances of various actors were lauded by critics. Wigler noted that Bernthal, Holden, and DeMunn delivered \\"brilliant character work\\", a view that was echoed by Pierce in regards to Emmerich's performance; \\"He has a nervous intensity that grounded every scene he was in, which this show needs.\\" Similarly, Alan Sepinwall of HitFix described Emmerich's acting as \\"haunting\\", and ultimately cited the performances of Lincoln, Holden, and DeMunn as episode highlights. Ryan affirmed that character development remained one of the series' strongest points. Deleted scene In a scene deleted from the television series, after Rick's group flees the CDC they return to the Atlanta nursing home they first visited in \\"Vatos\\", only to find the residents and their protectors have been killed execution-style and their supplies ransacked.

History  = A Scottish Presbyterian church = Alexander Duff, a Presbyterian Scottish missionary, arrived in Calcutta at the beginning of the 19th century. Very active, he established the General Assembly's Institution in 1830, which is now known as the Scottish Church College. In 1843, a serious schism divided the Church of Scotland, which had consequences even in India. The Presbyterians split into two groups. A new ‚ÄòFree Church of Scotland‚Äô was born. In Calcutta the new ‚ÄòFree‚Äô church built its place of worship at Wellesley Street. The two Presbyterian churches reconciled and formed a new union in 1929, as a consequence of which the Wellesley street church lost its importance. In Calcutta, from 1942 on, the two religious congregations joined together in only one, choosing the St. Andrew's Church as their place of worship. = A Jesuit Church = In 1969 the Wellesley church and attached buildings are handed over to the Jesuit fathers who give it the Bengali name of ‚ÄòPrabhu Jisur Girja‚Äô (Church of the Lord Jesus). The adjacent building became the fathers‚Äô residence and a centre of pastoral activities in the Bengali language (secretariat for liturgical translations, Christian Life Movement‚Äôs office, 'Leadership training service', etc.). Over the years other pastoral works and institutions were established: a center of media and social communications, called \`Chitrabani', since 1973. A house of formation for young Jesuits, since 1981. = Becoming a Catholic parish = In 2005 the vast church, which till then was technically a ‚Äòpublic oratory‚Äô is made a parish of the Archdiocese of Calcutta, under the same title of \`Prabhu Jisur Girja'.

He stayed through during the Partition of India and chose to reside in Pakistan, till his demise on 9 May 1980 in Rawalpindi. He painted significant civil and military personalities, landscapes and still life. His works included many Pakistan Army officers, two of whom became Pakistan's Heads of State: Field Marshal Ayub Khan and General Yahya Khan. He is buried in the Christian Graveyard in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Early life Born in Barton Regis Rural District, Gloucestershire, England on 28 October 1894, to Bertram Amor Bevan-Petman (1870‚Äì1931) and Maria Minnie Bevan Petman (1869‚Äì1942), his family was of Anglo-Indian ancestry, and included prominent lawyers and judges who served at various eminent positions during the British Raj. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol \\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p288: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April 1948 from 1908 to 1910 and resided through this period at North Town Boys House; and played cricket for the Clifton College XI at Lord's against Tonbridge in 1914. Bevan-Petman subsequently applied to and was accepted by Slade School of Fine Art in 1914, and received a two-year scholarship amounting to ¬£35. This scholarship was then renewed in 1916. During this scholastic period he received the First Prize for Figure Painting and Figure Drawing. Furthermore, he was awarded certificates in Perspective, History of Art, Figure Drawing, and satisfied the requirements for a Diploma in Fine Art in History of Art (Painting in Spain and the Netherlands). He graduated from Slade School of Art in 1917 after being awarded a certificate in 'Painting from Life'. Career beginnings As a young artist in 1920s London, he painted models who came to be known as 'The Petman Girls', serialised in The Illustrated London News, The Sketch and Bystander. The drawings were considered risque in a prudish post-Edwardian era, and could be considered as precursors to the modern 'Page 3 Girls' of The Sun Newspaper of today. These drawings clearly reflect his trademark long necks in all his models, and was to become his signature in later works. Prints of these drawings are classified as vintage erotica, and can be purchased off the web. It is unclear where the original artworks reside, but, by any standard they remain highly collectible, signifying a rare genre of its time.

Pre-partition British India Hal Bevan-Petman painted many landscapes during this era and on one occasion was commissioned by the India Tourism Office for a 'See India' poster. The mountain ranges of Kashmir appear frequently in his landscapes and are considered rare. During this time, he also taught a young Amrita Sher-Gil (1913‚Äì1941), who went on to become a talented Indian painter. He also had clients from Indian Royalty for whom he did portraits and the occasional risque renditions. This included the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who corresponded with Hal on a regular basis. Such commissions have remained very private, elusive and very rarely displayed.  Post- Partition Pakistan  During his time in Pakistan he painted practically every notable personality and/or their spouses, ranging from Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, various subsequent presidents and Military Commanders. He was commissioned to paint military battle scenes which adorn the walls of various Pakistani Military Academic Institutions. He also painted several war heroes who were decorated posthumously with the Nishan-e-Haider, Pakistan's highest military award. One of the most celebrated amongst them is Major Raja Aziz Bhatti.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=362133893860990&set;=pb.362130413861338.-2207520000.1377607975.&type;=3&theater; Death He died on 9 May 1980 and is buried in the Rawalpindi Christian Cemeteryhttp://halbevanpetman.com/images/death_large_1.jpg flanked by the graves of his wife Beryl and sister-in-law, Eve Strauss n√©e Dyer respectively.

Submodular functions have a natural diminishing returns property which makes them suitable for many applications, including approximation algorithms, game theory (as functions modeling user preferences) and electrical networks. Recently, submodular functions have also found immense utility in several real world problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence, including automatic summarization, multi-document summarization, feature selection, active learning, sensor placement, image collection summarization and many other domains.  Definition  If \\\\Omega is a finite set, a submodular function is a set function f:2^{\\\\Omega}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}, where 2^\\\\Omega denotes the power set of \\\\Omega, which satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions. # For every X, Y \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega with X \\\\subseteq Y and every x \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\setminus Y we have that f(X\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})-f(X)\\\\geq f(Y\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})-f(Y). # For every S, T \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega we have that f(S)+f(T)\\\\geq f(S\\\\cup T)+f(S\\\\cap T). # For every X\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega and x_1,x_2\\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\backslash X such that x_1 eq x_2 we have that f(X\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_1\\\\\\\\})+f(X\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_2\\\\\\\\})\\\\geq f(X\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2\\\\\\\\})+f(X). A nonnegative submodular function is also a subadditive function, but a subadditive function need not be submodular. If \\\\Omega is not assumed finite, then the above conditions are not equivalent. In particular a function f defined by f(S) = 1 if S is finite and f(S) = 0 if S is infinite satisfies the first condition above, but the second condition fails when S and T are infinite sets with finite intersection.  Types of submodular functions  = Monotone = A submodular function f is monotone if for every T\\\\subseteq S we have that f(T)\\\\leq f(S). Examples of monotone submodular functions include: ; Linear (Modular) functions : Any function of the form f(S)=\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}w_i is called a linear function. Additionally if \\\\forall i,w_i\\\\geq 0 then f is monotone. ; Budget-additive functions : Any function of the form f(S)=\\\\min\\\\left\\\\\\\\{B,~\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}w_i\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for each w_i\\\\geq 0 and B\\\\geq 0 is called budget additive. ; Coverage functions : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{E_1,E_2,\\\\ldots,E_n\\\\\\\\} be a collection of subsets of some ground set \\\\Omega'. The function f(S)=\\\\left\\\\bigcup_{E_i\\\\in S}E_i\\\\right for S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega is called a coverage function. This can be generalized by adding non- negative weights to the elements. ; Entropy : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots,X_n\\\\\\\\} be a set of random variables. Then for any S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega we have that H(S) is a submodular function, where H(S) is the entropy of the set of random variables S, a fact known as Shannon's inequality. Further inequalities for the entropy function are known to hold, see entropic vector. ; Matroid rank functions : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{e_1,e_2,\\\\dots,e_n\\\\\\\\} be the ground set on which a matroid is defined. Then the rank function of the matroid is a submodular function.Fujishige (2005) p.22 = Non-monotone = A submodular function which is not monotone is called non-monotone.  Symmetric  A non- monotone submodular function f is called symmetric if for every S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega we have that f(S)=f(\\\\Omega-S). Examples of symmetric non-monotone submodular functions include: ; Graph cuts : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{v_1,v_2,\\\\dots,v_n\\\\\\\\} be the vertices of a graph. For any set of vertices S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega let f(S) denote the number of edges e=(u,v) such that u\\\\in S and v\\\\in \\\\Omega-S. This can be generalized by adding non-negative weights to the edges. ; Mutual information : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots,X_n\\\\\\\\} be a set of random variables. Then for any S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega we have that f(S)=I(S;\\\\Omega-S) is a submodular function, where I(S;\\\\Omega-S) is the mutual information.  Asymmetric  A non- monotone submodular function which is not symmetric is called asymmetric. ; Directed cuts : Let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{v_1,v_2,\\\\dots,v_n\\\\\\\\} be the vertices of a directed graph. For any set of vertices S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega let f(S) denote the number of edges e=(u,v) such that u\\\\in S and v\\\\in \\\\Omega-S. This can be generalized by adding non-negative weights to the directed edges.  Continuous extensions  = Lov√°sz extension = This extension is named after mathematician L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz. Consider any vector \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} such that each 0\\\\leq x_i\\\\leq 1. Then the Lov√°sz extension is defined as f^L(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\mathbb{E}(f(\\\\\\\\{ix_i\\\\geq \\\\lambda\\\\\\\\})) where the expectation is over \\\\lambda chosen from the uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. The Lov√°sz extension is a convex function if and only if f is a submodular function. = Multilinear extension = Consider any vector \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n\\\\\\\\} such that each 0\\\\leq x_i\\\\leq 1. Then the multilinear extension is defined as F(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\sum_{S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega} f(S) \\\\prod_{i\\\\in S} x_i \\\\prod_{i otin S} (1-x_i). = Convex closure = Consider any vector \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} such that each 0\\\\leq x_i\\\\leq 1. Then the convex closure is defined as f^-(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\min\\\\left(\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S f(S):\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S 1_S=\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S=1,\\\\alpha_S\\\\geq 0\\\\right). The convex closure of any set function is convex over [0,1]^n. It can be shown that f^L(\\\\mathbf{x})=f^-(\\\\mathbf{x}) for submodular functions. = Concave closure = Consider any vector \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} such that each 0\\\\leq x_i\\\\leq 1. Then the concave closure is defined as f^+(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\max\\\\left(\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S f(S):\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S 1_S=\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\sum_S \\\\alpha_S=1,\\\\alpha_S\\\\geq 0\\\\right).  Properties  # The class of submodular functions is closed under non-negative linear combinations. Consider any submodular function f_1,f_2,\\\\ldots,f_k and non- negative numbers \\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_k. Then the function g defined by g(S)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\alpha_i f_i(S) is submodular. #For any submodular function f, the function defined by g(S)=f(\\\\Omega \\\\setminus S) is submodular. #The function g(S)=\\\\min(f(S),c), where c is a real number, is submodular whenever f is monotone submodular. More generally, g(S)=h(f(S)) is submodular, for any non decreasing concave function h. # Consider a random process where a set T is chosen with each element in \\\\Omega being included in T independently with probability p. Then the following inequality is true \\\\mathbb{E}[f(T)]\\\\geq p f(\\\\Omega)+(1-p) f(\\\\varnothing) where \\\\varnothing is the empty set. More generally consider the following random process where a set S is constructed as follows. For each of 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq l, A_i\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega construct S_i by including each element in A_i independently into S_i with probability p_i. Furthermore let S=\\\\cup_{i=1}^l S_i. Then the following inequality is true \\\\mathbb{E}[f(S)]\\\\geq \\\\sum_{R\\\\subseteq [l]} \\\\Pi_{i\\\\in R}p_i \\\\Pi_{i otin R}(1-p_i)f(\\\\cup_{i\\\\in R}A_i).  Optimization problems  Submodular functions have properties which are very similar to convex and concave functions. For this reason, an optimization problem which concerns optimizing a convex or concave function can also be described as the problem of maximizing or minimizing a submodular function subject to some constraints. = Submodular set function minimization= The simplest minimization problem is to find a set S\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega which minimizes a submodular function; this is the unconstrained problem. This problem is computable in (strongly) polynomial time. Computing the minimum cut in a graph is a special case of this general minimization problem. However, adding even a simple constraint such as a cardinality lower bound makes the minimization problem NP hard, with polynomial factor lower bounds on the approximation factor. = Submodular set function maximization= Unlike the case of minimization, maximizing a submodular functions is NP-hard even in the unconstrained setting. For instance max cut is a special case even when the function is required only to be non-negative. The unconstrained problem can be shown to be inapproximable if it is allowed to be negative. There has been extensive work on constrained submodular function maximization when the functions are non-negative. Typically, the approximation algorithms for these problems are based on either greedy algorithms or local search algorithms. The problem of maximizing a non- negative symmetric submodular function admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm. Computing the maximum cut of a graph is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing a non-negative submodular function also admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm. The problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint admits a 1 - 1/e approximation algorithm. The maximum coverage problem is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint also admits a 1 - 1/e approximation algorithm. Many of these algorithms can be unified within a semi-differential based framework of algorithms. =Related optimization problems= Apart from submodular minimization and maximization, another natural problem is Difference of Submodular Optimization. Unfortunately, this problem is not only NP hard, but also inapproximable. A related optimization problem is minimize or maximize a submodular function, subject to a submodular level set constraint (also called submodular optimization subject to submodular cover or submodular knapsack constraint). This problem admits bounded approximation guarantees. Another optimization problem involves partitioning data based on a submodular function, so as to maximize the average welfare. This problem is called the submodular welfare problem.  Applications  Submodular functions naturally occur in several real world applications, in economics, game theory, machine learning and computer vision. Owing the diminishing returns property, submodular functions naturally model costs of items, since there is often a larger discount, with an increase in the items one buys. Submodular functions model notions of complexity, similarity and cooperation when they appear in minimization problems. In maximization problems, on the other hand, they model notions of diversity, information and coverage.

In 21012 improvements to the park's greenway were funded with a $1.8 million appropriation from the state. The reaches of the Passaic along the park have long been popular with rowing teams The park is home to the boathouse used Kearny, Belleville, and Nutley high school oarsmen. Dedications Various sections of park are dedicated to historical figures and events. In some cases they are named for local dignitaries, such as Norman A. Doyle, Henry J. Hill, Daniel T. Sansone, and Joseph M. Healey, all of whom served as councilmen and as Mayor of Kearny. Keating Cove is dedicated to Bernard J. Keating and Wallace Glen is dedicated to both Sir William Wallace and Councilman David A. Wallace. Irish Heritage Park is dedicated to Reverend Monsignor Joseph A. Carroll. Other sections included the Centential Orchard and one dedicated to Christopher Columbus. Another part is named in memory of the Battle of Chantilly, where the town's namesake, Philip Kearny, lost his life in 1862. In 2006, many signboards demarcating the sections were replaced in a sponsorship campaign to re-new them. Former Home for Disabled Soldiers thumb While most of the park is parallel to the river, Veterans Memorial Park covers an area that travels farther inland, and is situated on what was once the site of the New Jersey Home for Disabled Soldiers, an old soldiers' home which operated from 1888 to 1932, after which it donated the 10-acre grounds to the town for public recreational use.

Located at 117 East Fourth Street, on the banks of the Ohio River, it is one of the few remaining river town hotels that faces the river. The original name of the hotel is the Landora. History The hotel, which opened in 1908, was designed by Cassius Metsch, a local architect who also designed the YMCA building in East Liverpool. The hotel's entrance was originally on the corner of Crook Alley and East Fourth Street. In 1910, a banquet room and kitchen were added. A rear wing of the building was added in 1915. In 1927, a kitchen and the 'Jigger' room were constructed. The hotel also maintained a \\"Sample Room\\". In this area, traveling salesmen could display samples of their products. The Sample Room is now a small banquet room. Notable guests The Ceramic Theater was across the street from the hotel and performers at the theater would often stay at the hotel while in town. The hotel hosted Blackstone the magician, Paul Whiteman, the Marine Band, and the Roger Wagner Chorale. In 1934, during the hunt for Pretty Boy Floyd (who was killed in nearby Clarkson, Ohio), FBI Special Agent Melvin Purvis used the Travelers Hotel as his headquarters. Renovation The hotel was renovated in the 1980s. As part of the historical renovation of the hotel, items from a number of local buildings were used. The lobby lights were from the Moore building and the brass door guards and handles were taken from the King-Ealls Hardware building. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in July 1986.

Biographical details  In 1930, Hirsch was elected president of the high council of the Jewish Religious Community in W√ºrttemberg.Otto Hirsch biography Zeichen der Erinnerung. Retrieved October 2, 2011 After the Machtergreifung when the Nazis seized power, he protested the Nazis' power grab and organized Jewish self-help. Hirsch was one of the founders of the Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden and was named to its board of directors; the president was Leo Baeck. Hirsch moved to Berlin to devote himself to his duties, first taking a leave of absence and later resigning as president of the W√ºrttemberg Jewish Community's high council. He was arrested the first time by the Gestapo in 1935, but was soon released. In 1938, he represented German Jews at the international √âvian Conference in France, convened at the initiative of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Returning to Berlin, he continued his protests. Shortly after Kristallnacht, Hirsch was again arrested, this time for protesting the pogrom. He was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks and was released, after which he devoted himself to helping Jews to emigrate. In July 1939, the security police named Hirsch, Baeck and others to the board of the newly formed Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, with which the Reichsvertretung was forced to merge. On February 16, 1941, Hirsch was again arrested, this time without explanation. On May 23, he was sent to Mauthausen and according to Nazi records, Hirsch died on June 19, 1941. The exact circumstances surrounding his death remain unknown. At the opening of the Stuttgart port on March 31, 1958, the city of Stuttgart named a bridge after Otto Hirsch. On January 9, 1985, a memorial to Hirsch was unveiled on the bridge. Since 1985, a medal in Hirsch's name is awarded annually by the city, along with a Judaeo- Christian organization and the Jewish Religious Community. The medal is awarded to people who have devoted themselves to cooperative work between Christians and Jews.  Bibliography  * Paul Sauer, F√ºr Recht und Menschenw√ºrde.

Role of nitrogen Nitrogen is a vital macronutrient for plants, necessary for the biosynthesis of many basic cellular components, such as DNA, RNA and proteins. Nitrogen is obtained by plants through roots from inorganic or organic sources, such as amino acids.Govindarajulu, Manjula; Pfeffer,Philip E.; Jin, Hairu; Abubaker, Jehad; Douds, David D; Allen, James W.; Bucking, Heike; Lammers, Peter J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005). \\"Sulfur Transfer through an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza\\". Plant Physiology 149:549-560 In agricultural settings, nitrogen may be a limiting factor for plant growth and yield, and in total, as a critical cellular component that a plant deficient in this nitrogen will shunt resources away from its shoot in order to expand its root system so that it can acquire more nitrogen.Marschner, Horst. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, 2002, p. 250 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are divided into two parts depending on where the mycelium is located. The intra-radical mycelia (IRM) are found within the root itself while the extra-radical mycelium (ERM) are tiny hyphal threads which reach far out into the soil. The IRM is the site of nutrient exchange between the symbionts, while the ERM effectively serves as an extension of the plant's root system by increasing the surface area available for nutrient acquisition, including nitrogen, which can be taken up in the form of ammonium, nitrate or from organic sources.Allen, James W. and Shachar-Hill, Yair (2009). \\"Sulfur Transfer through an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza\\".

New Phytologist 168:687√±696 of the root nitrogen was taken up via the fungus. This is also true in in planta studies, such as an experiment in which the researchers showed that 75% of the nitrogen in a young maize leaf originated from the ERM.Tanaka, Yoko; Yano, Katsuya (2005). \\"Nitrogen delivery to maize via mycorrhizal hyphae depends on the form of N supplied\\". Plant, Cell and Environment 28:1247-1254. =Mechanism of action= The precise mechanism(s) by which nitrogen is taken up from the soil by the ERM, transported to the IRM, and then turned over to the plant are still under investigation. Toward elucidating the mechanisms through which nitrogen transfer is completed, the sum of numerous studies have provided the necessary tools to study this process. For example, the detection and measurement of gene expression has enabled researchers to determine which genes are up-regulated in the plant and fungus under various nitrogen conditions. Another important tool is the use of the nitrogen isotope 15N, which can be distinguished from the more common 14N isotope. Nitrogen- containing compounds thus labeled can be tracked and measured as they move through the fungus and into the plant, as well as how they are incorporated into nitrogen-containing molecules. The current model, first put forth in 2005, proposes that the nitrogen taken up by the fungus is converted in the ERM to arginine, which is then transported to the IRM, where it is released as ammonium into the apoplast for the plant to use.Govindarajulu, Manjula; Pfeffer,Philip E.; Jin, Hairu; Abubaker, Jehad; Douds, David D; Allen, James W.; Bucking, Heike; Lammers, Peter J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005) \\"Nitrogen transfer in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis\\". Nature 435:819-823 A growing body of data has supported and expanded upon this model. Support has been found primarily in two ways: labeling experiments and the study of gene expression, as demonstrated in a 2010 paper by Tian et al. When labeled nitrogen compounds were added to the ERM compartment of an in vitro bsystem, six fungal genes encoding enzymes involved in the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen into glutamine and its subsequent conversion to arginine were rapidly up-regulated. After a delay, gene expression in the IRM began to show increasing levels of mRNA for genes involved in the breakdown of arginine into urea and the subsequent cleaving of ammonium from the urea molecule. This change in gene expression takes place concurrently with the arrival of 15N labeled arginine from the ERM compartment.Tian, Chunjie; Kasiborski, Beth; Koul, Raman; Lammers, Peter J.; Bucking, Heike; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2010). Regulation of the Nitrogen Transfer Pathway in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis: Gene Characterization and the Coordination of Expression with Nitrogen Flux\\". Plant Physiology 153:1175-1187. Once inside the ERM, the nitrogen molecule may have to travel many centimeters to reach the root. While much progress has been made on either end of the transfer of nitrogen, the mechanism by which the arginine actually moves from the ERM to the IRM remains unresolved. AM fungi are non-septate and lack cell walls between cells, forming one long filament. However, passive flow through the continuous cytoplasm is too slow to explain the transport of nutrients. The mechanism by which the newly manufactured arginine is transported to the plant requires further investigation. =Community and ecology= A single plant with its associated fungus is not an isolated entity. It has been shown that mycelia from the roots of one plant actually colonize the roots of nearby plants, creating an underground network of plants of the same or different species. It has been demonstrated that nitrogen is transferred between plants via the hyphal network, sometimes in large amounts. For example, Cheng and Baumgartner found that about 25% of the labeled nitrogen supplied to a source plant, in this case a grass species, was transferred to the sink plant, grapevine.Cheng, Xiaomei and Baumgartner, Kendra (2004). \\"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-mediated nitrogen transfer from vineyard cover crops to grapevines\\". Biology and Fertility of Soils 40:406-412. It is widely believed that these hyphal networks are important to local ecosystems and may have agricultural implications. Some plants, called legumes, can form simultaneous symbiotic relationships with both AM fungi and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Rhizobia. In fact, both organisms trigger the same pathways in plants during early colonization, indicating that the two very different responses could share a common origin. While the bacteria can supply nitrogen, they cannot provide other benefits of AM fungi; AM actually enhances bacterial colonization, probably by supplying extra phosphorus for the formation of the bacterial habitat within the plant, and thus contributing indirectly to the plant's nitrogen status.Barea, J. M.; Escudero, J. L.; Azcon-G de Aguilar, C. (1980). \\"Effects of introduced and indigenous VA mycorrhizal fungi on nodulation, growth and nutrition of Medicago sativa in phosphate-fixing soils as affected by P fertilizers\\". Plant and Soil 54:283-296 It is not known if there is signaling between the two, or only between the plant and each microbe. There is almost certainly competition between the bacterial and fungal partners, whether directly or indirectly, due to the fact that both are dependent on the plant as their sole source of energy. The plant must strive to strike a delicate balance between the maintenance of both partners based on its nutrient status. = Alternate theories = A large body of research has shown that AM fungi can, and do, transfer nitrogen to plants and transfer nitrogen between plants, including crop plants. However, it has not been shown conclusively that there is a growth benefit from AM due to nitrogen. Some researchers doubt that AM contribute significantly to plant N status in nature.Smith, S. E. and Read, D. J. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. Academic Press, 2008. In one field study, there was negligible transfer between soybeans and corn.Hamel, Chantal and Smith, Donald L. (1992). \\"Mycorrhizae-mediated 15N transfer from soybean to corn in field-grown intercrops: Effect of component crop spatial relationships\\". Soil Biology and Biochemistry 24:499-501. Furthermore, AM sometimes appears to be parasitic. This has primarily been seen under conditions of high nitrogen, which is not the usual state in a natural environment. However, it has been shown that in at least one case, colonization by AM fungi under nitrogen-limiting conditions lead to decreased shoot biomass,Johnson, Nancy Collins; Wilson, Gail W. T.; Bowker, Matthew A.;Wilson, Jacqueline A.; Miller, R. Michael (2010). \\"Resource limitation is a driver of local adaptation in mychorrhizal symbioses\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107:2093-2098. implying that the relationship does the plant more harm than good. Likewise in a multi-plant system it would be very difficult to find the advantage to the source plants when their nutrients are being shunted to sink plants. These findings are at odds with the observed phenomenon that under conditions of low phosphorus, the degree of AM colonization is inversely proportional to nitrogen availability.Blanke, Verena; Renker, Carsten; Wagner, Markus; F√ºllner, Kerstin; Held, Matthias; Kuhn, Arnd J.; Buscot, Fran√ßois (2005). \\"Nitrogen supply affects arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of Artemisia vulgaris in a phosphate-polluted field site\\". New Phytologist 166:981-992. Since the plant must supply all of the energy needed to grow and sustain the fungus, it seems counter-intuitive that it would do so without some benefit to itself. Further studies are definitely needed to delineate the details of the relationship between the symbionts, including a gradient of interaction that runs from mutualism to parasitism.

Fulton's duties required frequent quarter-mile walks from the station atop the Hill to the railroad bridge over the Tennessee River, where a river gauge had been mounted, to check the river's depths.William MacArthur, Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa, Okla.: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), p. 171. To eliminate this daily walk, Fulton designed an automatic gauge mechanism, which was essentially a float-actuated device that kept a continuous record of river levels. The Weather Bureau used the device at several of its weather stations in the early 1900s. =The Fulton Company= Fulton Company ad, c. 1921 Using U.T.'s laboratories, Fulton conducted numerous weather experiments. While studying the effects of lightning on the atmosphere, Fulton designed a seamless metal container that could trap vapor while allowing for its expansion and contraction as the pressure changed. He called this new container the \\"sylphon,\\" after the sylphs of Western mythology. Fulton quickly realized that his invention could be used as a bellows, and thus would have numerous industrial uses. In 1904, he left the Weather Bureau, and with financial backing from businessman John Scruggs Brown, he launched the Fulton Company to market sylphon-based products. One of the company's first successful products was a damper regulator for boilers that used a sylphon to automatically adjust the damper position as the temperature changed. The earliest automobile thermostats used sylphons for actuation. By 1940, over 50 million sylphons were in daily use the United States alone.Matt Lakin, \\"Notorious Outlaw, Notable Invention Among Biggest Stories for Sentinel in New Century,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 29 January 2012. Retrieved: 29 January 2012. During World War I, Fulton developed the firing mechanism for the depth charge, a weapon used by surface ships to destroy submarines. The mechanism consisted of a graduated disk that measured water pressure (which increases with depth), and ignited when a pre-set depth was reached. Depth charges allowed Allied navies to defeat German U-boat blockades. =Politics and later business ventures= In 1923, Fulton was elected to Knoxville's city council, and was chosen as vice mayor. Along with wholesaling tycoons Benjamin Morton and Rush Hazen, Fulton was part of a slate of progressive candidates elected during the city's transition from a commissioner-style government (which was deemed corrupt) to a council-manager form of government, which called for the hiring of a city manager to oversee the city's business affairs.William MacArthur, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), \\"Knoxville's History: An Interpretation,\\" Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 51-53. Knoxville's first city manager, Louis Brownlow, was hired after being interviewed by Fulton.Louis Brownlow, A Passion for Anonymity (University of Chicago Press, 1958), p. 153. Brownlow proved controversial, however, and his supporters were ousted in 1927. Fulton never ran for office again, and advised his children to avoid politics. In 1928, Fulton built a palatial mansion, Westcliff, on Lyons View Pike in West Knoxville. The mansion was designed by prominent local architect Charles I. Barber, who later recalled it as one of his most difficult projects, as Fulton continuously demanded modifications to the design, even as construction was nearing completion.William Ross McNabb, \\"Westcliff: Mr. Fulton's Mansion,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 49 (1977), p. 94. Fulton had a workshop on the second floor of the house. In 1929, Fulton bought the W. J. Savage Company, which specialized in flour mill and marble processing machinery. The following year, he sold the Fulton Company, which had been reorganized as the Fulton Sylphon Company, to focus on W. J. Savage. He also acquired interests in several other local factories, including Royal Manufacturing, which made furniture. Just before he died in 1946, Fulton had been making plans for the manufacture of a cleaner-burning, \\"nonchoking\\" furnace. Legacy Following its sale in the late 1920s, the Fulton Sylphon Company operated as a subsidiary of the Reynolds Metal Company. In 1947, several Reynolds subsidiaries merged to form Robertshaw Controls, and the Fulton factory operated as the Fulton Sylphon Division of this company for several decades. In 1986, the British engineering firm Siebe purchased Robertshaw, and used the Fulton plant to manufacture car parts. In the mid-1990s, Siebe began selling off its American holdings, and the Fulton factory was purchased by financier Robert Greaves. Inspired by the factory's original owner, Greaves named the new company Fulton Bellows, which manufactures seamless metal bellows. In 1928, Fulton donated his house (built in 1913) at 820 Temple Avenue (now 900 Volunteer Boulevard) to the University of Tennessee as a memorial to his son, Weston, Jr., who died from injuries sustained in a car crash that year.Jack Neely, \\"Miracle on Third Creek,\\" Metro Pulse, 5 October 2000.

Early years Ernst Marlier was the son of Philipp Marlier (died c. 1902), a postal official, and Mathilda Marlier (n√©e Forkeln). After receiving commercial training in the Fuchs Book Factory, Marlier fulfilled his military service obligation in Infantry Regiment 22 in Kassel, after which he moved to Nuremberg. There, he was the proprietor of a shipping firm, Micado. Drug maker In 1903, Marlier settled in Berlin (Kurf√ºrstenstrasse 173a, later Sternstrasse 22), where he founded multiple drug firms (Chemische Fabrik Dr. Schr√∂der GmbH, Chemische Fabrik Dr. Hartmann GmbH, Chemische Fabrik Dr. Wagner und Marlier) and the coal wholesaler Julius Marlier. By 1907, Marlier was already having problems with police headquarters, which warned that Marlier‚Äôs preparations ‚Äúdid not have the properties ascribed to them in their sales information.‚ÄùRecord 1520, Landesarchiv Berlin Among the pharmaceuticals Marlier sold were Antipositin, Antineurasthin, Renascin, Slankal, Levathin, Visnervin, Vitalito and H√§masol.Michael Haupt Das Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz - Von der Industriellenvilla zur Gedenkst√§tte, Berlin, 2009 Assault charges In 1904, Marlier was charged with battery and disturbance of the peace, and sentenced to six days in jail. In 1913, on the corner of Friedrichstra√üe and J√§gerstra√üe, Marlier was arrested for assault and battery. According to the police, Marlier had slapped the face of a woman waiting at a cab stand. When two drivers intervened, Marlier beat them both. A policeman named Brandt saw the disturbance and approached, whereupon Marlier attacked him. According to the police report, Marlier was taken to the police precinct. A wild scene ensued, the furious Marlier accosting everyone in sight. Marlier was sentenced to pay a 600 mark fine.

However, Marlier was unable to retain the villa because of his business problems. In 1905, the Pharmaceutical Institute of Berlin determined that Marlier‚Äôs medicines consisted of nothing more than tartaric acid, citric acid, sodium chloride, and egg yolk.Apotheker-Zeitung, Nr. 20/1905 In 1907, the German government forbade the sale of Marlier‚Äôs Antipositin and Antineurasthin. Marlier became involved in a tangle of legal troubles, and in 1921, he was forced to sell the Wannsee Villa to industrialist Friedrich Minoux for 2,300,000 reichsmarks.

Life and career Patterson was born in Philadelphia to Irish-American army officer Robert Patterson, himself a general during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Civil War, and Sarah Engle. His brother was brevet Brig. Gen. Robert Emmet Patterson, and he was brother-in-law to another Union general, John Joseph Abercrombie. Like his father, he entered the army during the Mexican-American War, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery (June 24, 1847 October 28, 1847). He was promoted to first lieutenant October 29, 1847. After the war, Patterson transferred to the 9th U.S. Infantry where he was promoted to captain, March 3, 1855; he resigned May 1, 1857.Eicher, p. 418. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Patterson rejoined the army and was commissioned colonel of the 17th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, April 25, 1861. He was promoted to brigadier general in the United States Volunteers on April 11, 1862 and placed in command of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, III Corps, Army of the Potomac. Patterson led his brigade at Williamsburg and Seven Pines, but during the latter battle, he had to relinquish command due to illness, apparently typhoid fever. He took a leave of absence on June 7 and so missed the Seven Days Battles entirely. By July, he was well enough to take on administrative duties at army headquarters. Patterson did not return to field command until the fall months when he resumed command of his old brigade, now in Daniel Sickles's division. However, recurrent ill health continued to plague him. Patterson was at Catlett's Station when he withdrew his brigade upon hearing unconfirmed reports of a Confederate troop presence nearby. Sickles accused him of retreating without orders and called for a military board of inquiry to court-martial him. However, on November 2, Patterson was found dead in his tent of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Initially it was not clear whether his death was accidental or a suicide. But an article in The Baltimore Sun from 29 November 1862 cites an eye witness, Capt. Vreeland of the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry who was with him in his tent at the time. Vreeland states that Patterson \\"committed the act while under a temporary insanity ... so suddenly was the rash act committed that (I) could not stay his hand.\\" Francis E.

Her film credits included Live Fast, Die Young and The Return of Dracula, both released in 1958. Biography =Early life and career= Eberhardt was born and raised in Oakhurst, New Jersey. She was discovered by a fashion photographer as a teenager while attending an Easter Parade on the Asbury Park boardwalk with her mother. Reportedly, the photographer was struck by her two different colored eyes, one brown eye and one blue eye. The photographer, who was based in nearby New York City, assumed that Eberhardt was over the age of 18. However, when she commuted to his office on her seventeenth birthday, the photographer realized that he needed her mother to co-sign her modeling contract. He personally drove her back home to obtain her mother's permission and signature for the contract. Eberhardt soon signed with the John Robert Powers Agency, appearing in advertising campaigns on billboards. =Acting= Eberhardt's billboard campaigns soon led to radio, television and film roles. She moved to Los Angeles and was under contract with a studio by 1951. She rented a room at the Studio Club For Women in Hollywood, where she became roommates with actress Mary Murphy. (Eberhardt and Murphy would later co-star in the 1958 film, Live Fast, Die Young). Both actresses dated actor James Dean. Eberhardt, Murphy and Dean were all cast in small roles in the 1952 comedy, Sailor Beware, starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Sailor Beware marked Eberhardt's film debut, as well as Dean's second film role. Eberhardt also dated Jerry Lewis during this time. Her second film role was in 1952's Jumping Jacks, which also starred Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. She next portrayed an agoraphobic character locked up in a reform school for rich-girl delinquents in the 1953 film, Problem Girls, starring Susan Morrow. Eberhardt is best known for two starring film roles during 1958. She co-starred with Francis Lederer in the 1958 horror film, The Return of Dracula. That same year, she co-starred with her real-life former roommate, Mary Murphy, in the crime drama, Live Fast, Die Young. Eberhardt and Murphy played two sisters who run away from home to pursue a life of crime as jewelry thieves who become affiliated with the mafia. The film, which was marketed with the tagline, \\"A sin-steeped story of the rise of the Beat Generation,\\" struck a chord with its core audience and has become a cult classic. In an interview, Eberhardt mused on the film's cult popularity by speculating, \\"The film tapped into what kids were feeling‚Äîthat society sucked and they were rebelling against it.\\" In 2007, Eberhardt's image from Live Fast, Die Young appeared on T-shirts worn by Slash, the guitarist for Guns N' Roses and supergroup Velvet Revolver. Eberhardt was described as \\"highly amused\\" when she discovered that her likeness appeared on Slash's wardrobe. Eberhardt switched to television, including guest roles on Dragnet in 1959 and the CBS sitcom, Hogan's Heroes, in 1969. =Personal life= Eberhardt married Claude Dauphin, a French actor and former member of the French Resistance, in 1955. Dauphin, who began acting in the 1930s, operated an underground radio station in Nazi occupied France during World War II. The couple divided their married life between residences in Paris, New York City, Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey, and Hollywood. Dauphin died in 1978. She was a founding member and an honorary trustee of the Township of Ocean Historical Museum in Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Norma Eberhardt died of a stroke at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on September 16, 2011, at the age of 82. She was survived by her 108-year-old father, George Eberhardt (1904‚Äì2014), and six brothers and sisters. Her funeral was held at the Church House of the Presbyterian Church in Shrewsbury, New Jersey.

The fighter planes were purchased from Czechoslovakia at $23,000 per plane. Arrangements were also made with the Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito to use the city of Nik≈°iƒá (an abandoned Luftwaffe airbase) as a waystation for 60 purchased Spitfires (codenamed \\"Yoram\\"). The commander of the Israelis at Nik≈°iƒá airfield was Gideon (Geda) Shochat, son of Manya Shochat and former RAF officer. The first of the two legs of the journey was from Kunovice, Czechoslovakia to Nik≈°iƒá (codenamed \\"Alabama\\"). The second leg was more difficult, crossing 2,250 km of open water from Nik≈°iƒá to Israel. Secrecy This operation was of high secrecy, as it was opposed by both Britain and the USSR. To preserve secrecy, the Israelis were not allowed to talk with Yugoslavian soldiers or citizens. They were given permission to use the base at Nik≈°iƒá and repaint their aircraft markings with Yugoslav roundels for the flight to Israel so that the shipment would not arouse any suspicions. After landing in Israel, the roundels were removed to uncover hidden Israeli roundels. Velvetta 1 =From Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia = The first leg of the journey took place on September 24. This section, which took an hour and a half, went well for the most part. Blau's landing gear failed to deploy, and although he was fine, the aircraft was severely damaged. = From Yugoslavia to Israel= The second part of the mission was much more difficult. This was a non-stop, five-hour-long flight over 2,500 miles of open water - quite a feat for the Spitfire. Sam Pomerance, the mechanic-in-chief in Czechoslovakia, suggested that to make the planes as light and efficient as possible, they should be fitted with extra fuel tanks and that nonessentials, such as radios and guns, should be removed. Walkie- talkies were used to talk during the flight. If forced to land in Albania or Greece on the way to Israel, the pilots decided to say that they were flying to Israel. The mission was successful and helped support the Israelis during the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. On September 27, 5 planes left for Israel. Alon and Senior ran out of fuel and had to make an emergency landing in Rhodes. They were arrested and interrogated, but did not reveal the flight path. On October 3, Israel sent an envoy to Greece and they were returned. The rest of the Spitfires successfully landed in Ramat David. Velvetta 2 Pomerance returned to Czechoslovakia and made 15 more flights to Israel, dividing the pilots into two formations. The planes left on December 15 and yet again on the December 18, but both times were forced to return due to rain and other poor weather conditions. Bill and Sam Pomerance were lost in flight, and it was later found out that Bill made an emergency landing 160 miles north of the Yoram airfield and Sam was killed when his plane crashed into the mountains. On December 19, 12 more Spitfires were flown to Israel. One plane was disabled due to technical issues. On December 22, the first formation of 5 planes flew to Israel; one plane turned back due to an engine failure. On December 26, the second 6-plane formation successfully arrived in Israel. A Skymaster was sent to Czechoslovakia to retrieve the guns and other parts that had been stripped from the aircraft.

He became a teacher before enrolling in a medical degree at the University of Sydney. He served for two years with the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps in World War I before completing his degree in 1920. He worked at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children and practised in Balmain in Sydney before moving to Isisford in Queensland as medical officer at the Isisford District Hospital. He later spent 17 years as a doctor at Longreach, including a stint as government medical officer, in which role he served until his election to parliament. He was known across the district for his early adoption of aeroplanes for use in medical care and his efforts to address children's welfare and trachoma. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at a 1939 by-election following the death of Labor MP George Pollock. Upon his election, he insisted that he would remain independent in addressing issues and touted key concerns as being the improvement of health services, housing and perishable food storage in western Queensland and the establishment of a local Australian Broadcasting Commission radio station. In February 1941, while a serving MP, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force to serve in World War II. However, two months later, he lost his seat to Labor candidate George Devries at the 1941 Queensland state election. Brown was the unsuccessful lead Senate candidate for the Country-National Organisation (affiliated with the federal United Australia Party) at the 1943 Australian federal election.

Bramich suddenly resigned as Minister for Housing and from the Labor Party on 11 September 1956, costing the Labor government its majority in parliament. He claimed that his recommendations were being ignored and his decisions set aside. He was also facing party censure for having, while Acting Minister for Health, made a public statement claiming that his colleagues had \\"deliberately frustrated\\" his efforts to reconstitute a country hospitals board. Bramich initially claimed that he would sit on the crossbenches, but defected to the Liberal Party later that day.

Its name derives from its round, ball-like shape, with a diameter of about eight to ten centimeters, and its traditional decoration with white confectioner's sugar. It is also called a Storchennest (stork's nest). History This kind of pastry has been known for at least 300 years in the regions of Franconia and Hohenlohe (northeast of Baden-W√ºrttemberg) where it is very popular. Served only on special occasions such as weddings in the past; they are nowadays available throughout the year and can be found around Rothenburg ob der Tauber in bakeries, pastry shops, and cafes. In the town itself there are even companies that specialize in the pastry, constantly coming out with new variations. Beside the classical ones dusted with confectioner's sugar, there are recipes glazed with chocolate and nuts or filled with marzipan. As the pastry is considered the signature dish of the town, it is a very common souvenir. Preparation The main ingredients are flour, eggs, sugar, butter, cream, and plum schnaps. To give it the characteristic shape, the dough is rolled out and cut into even strips with a dough cutter. The strips are then arranged alternately over and under a stick, or the handle of a wooden spoon. Eventually the stick is lifted and slowly removed while the dough strips are formed into a loose ball. Using a special round holder called a Schneeballeneisen in order to retain the shape, the ball is deep-fried in boiling fat until golden brown, and finally dusted with confectioner's sugar while warm. The schneeball is a dry, cookie-like pastry, so it has a long shelf life - about eight weeks without refrigeration.

The Earl was known from an early age to have an unsound mind, and his estate was placed under the control of four trustees. While Portsmouth had periods in which he appeared sane, he often engaged in a variety of bizarre and sadistic behavior. He whipped his servants, beat and bled his horses, and slaughtered cattle, shouting, with an axe. The Earl showed a remarkable mania for funerals, which he referred to as \\"black jobs\\". He attended them frequently, insisted on tolling the bells at Hurstbourne for funerals there, and sometimes flogged the ringers with the bellrope afterwards. On 19 November 1799, Portsmouth married Hon. Grace Norton, the sister of one of his trustees, William Norton, 2nd Baron Grantley. The marriage was encouraged by Portsmouth's younger brother, Hon. Newton Fellowes, as Grace was 47 years old at the marriage (Portsmouth was 31) and unlikely to produce an heir to displace Newton. However, Grace also played an important role in moderating Portsmouth's behavior and keeping his eccentricities out of the public eye. When, in 1808, she found herself no longer able to control the Earl, her relative, Dr. John Combe, was added to the household, to help suppress Portsmouth's manias.Suzuki, pp. 107‚Äì108 One of the trustees, Portsmouth's solicitor John Hanson, saw an opportunity at Grace's death in 1813. Without informing the other trustees or Portsmouth's brother Newton, he quickly arranged a marriage between Portsmouth and his daughter, Mary Anne. They were married on 7 March 1814; Lord Byron, another one of Hanson's clients, gave the bride away. When Newton attempted to have Portsmouth declared insane that autumn, Byron's affidavit as to the circumstances of the marriage was instrumental in getting the charge dismissed. However, the new Countess was by no means equal to the task of controlling Portsmouth; his behavior grew more erratic, while Mary Anne carried on an adulterous affair with William Alder, who fathered three children on her. Eventually, the pair of lovers grew so bold as to have intercourse in the same bed with the Earl (who was almost certainly impotent).Suzuki, pp. 12‚Äì13 A new commission de lunatico inquirendo took place in 1823, at the instigation of Portsmouth's nephew Henry Wallop Fellowes, and it was revealed that the Earl had been badly mistreated by his new wife and her lover, who had spat on him and beaten him.Suzuki, pp. 15‚Äì16 He was adjudged to have been insane since 1809. In 1828, his second marriage was annulled, and Mary Anne's children were declared bastards. A judgment for the ¬£40,000 cost of the trial was issued against her, and she fled abroad. Portsmouth died in 1853; his brother Newton succeeded him for less than half a year before his own death.

Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a figure of merit that is the cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air that has had all the particles of a given size distribution removed. For air filters that have air flowing through them, it is the fraction of particles (of a particular size distribution) that have been removed from the air, multiplied by the air flow rate (in CFM) through the device. More precisely, it is the CFM of air in a room that has had all the particles of a given size distribution removed from the air, over and above the rate at which the particles are naturally falling out of the air. Different filters have different abilities to remove different particle distributions, so three CADR's for a given device are typically measured: smoke, pollen, and dust. By combining the amount of airflow and particle removal efficiency, consumers are less likely to be misled by a high efficiency filter that is filtering a small amount of air, or by a high volume of air that is not being filtered very well. Applicability The CADR ratings were developed by Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) and are measured according to a procedure specified by ANSI/AHAM AC-1. The ratings are recognized by retailers, manufacturers, standards organizations, and government bodies such as the EPA and the Federal Trade Commission. Whole house air cleaners are not covered by the CADR specification because the measurement is performed in a standard room, the size of a typical house room, which has different airflow patterns than whole-house filters. Measurements are made with the filter running and not running, so particles that naturally fall out of the air are not being counted as part of filter's operation. The measurement only applies to particulate matter, not to gases. Any device or technology that removes particulate matter from the air can be tested for CADR numbers. Anyone with the necessary equipment can perform the ANSI/AHAM AC-1 measurements. The AHAM performs the tests for manufacturers who are paid members of AHAM which choose to use their service, allowing the manufacturer to display a seal that certifies AHAM performed the test. The CADR numbers reflect particulate matter remaining in the air, which has not been captured by the filter or other technology. Some low-efficiency filters employ ionization, which attaches a weak electrostatic charge to particulate matter, which can cause several smaller particles to group together resulting in a lower particle measurement count. Ionization can also cause particulate matter to attach to surfaces such as walls, and flooring, resulting in lower particulate counts in the air, but without having particulate matter permanently removed from the air. The rating is only valid for a given filter as used in a specific equipment design, and when the filter is brand new. The rating is based on a 20-minute test. Choosing a higher- or lower-efficiency filter than the unit was designed for may decrease its ability to filter air. An exception is when a high efficiency filter does not decrease the fan's airflow rate. This is usually achievable only with physically larger or thicker filters, which usually cannot be used in a unit designed for smaller filters. Filters with efficiencies higher than the original may slow the fan's airflow rate down, which may result in a lower CADR rating. Due to the measurement process, the CADR rating is intended for use only with equipment designed for residential spaces. Clean rooms, hospitals, and airplanes use high-efficiency HEPA filters and do not use a CADR rating, but instead may use MERV ratings.  Understanding the rating  The AHAM seal (usually found on the back of an air cleaner's box) lists three CADR numbers, one each for smoke, pollen, and dust. This order is from the smallest to largest particles and corresponds to the most dangerous to the least dangerous particles. The higher the CADR number, the more air it filters per minute for that particle size range. Consumers can use these ratings to compare air cleaners from the various manufacturers. The defined particle size ranges are 0.09‚Äì1.0 ¬µm for smoke, 0.5‚Äì3 ¬µm for dust, and 5‚Äì11 ¬µm for pollen. AHAM recommends following their '2/3' rule. Air filters should be chosen for rooms so that the value of its smoke CADR is equal to or greater than 2/3 the room area in units of square feet (valid for rooms up to in height). This recommendation is based on the assumption that the room will have air exchanged with other rooms at a rate of less than 1 room volume per hour, and that the customer desires at least 80% of the smoke particles removed from the air. For an high room, this means the room volume should be less than or equal to 12 times the CADR value. Much larger rooms can be effectively filtered if there is no air coming from the outside, and if there is no significant continuing source of particulates in the room. MERV 14 filters are capable of reducing smoke particles by approximately 80% when operating at the filter's design velocity, so a CADR smoke rating on a simple filtering unit that uses a MERV 14 filter will be approximately 0.80 times the fan flow rate in CFM. If the filtering unit does not mix the test room's air very well, it may receive a lower CADR measurement because it does not operate as efficiently as it should. If a filtering unit uses a MERV 12 filter that removes roughly 40% of the smoke particles, then it may still obtain a smoke CADR of 80 by filtering 200 cubic feet per minute instead of 100 CFM. Conversely, a 99.97% HEPA filter (MERV 17) that removes over 99.9% of the smoke particles needs to filter 80 cubic feet per minute to get a CADR of 80. This shows the CFM airflow of a unit is always equal to or greater than the CADR rating. Large particles naturally fall out of the air faster than small particles, but the CADR rating is based on how well the filter works over and above this effect. So CADR ratings for dust and pollen come out lower than would be expected by looking only at the filter's efficiency at removing large particles. This \\"bias\\" against the filter's efficiency at removing large particles is a relative bias in favor of the filter's ability to remove small (smoke) articles. Since smoke particles are the most difficult to filter (lower filter efficiency relative to large particles), the two effects largely cancel so that CADR ratings are usually similar for both small and large particles. A filter that is very good at removing smoke particles by using a slow fan or electrostatic effects will not get as good CADR numbers for pollen and dust because those particles will fall down and deposit on room surfaces during the test, before the filter has had a chance to collect them. For smoke-sized particles, a MERV 12 filter may function as well as a MERV 14 filter at half its rated air velocity (for smoke particles), and a MERV 14 may function like a MERV 12 at double its rated velocity. This is because smoke-sized particles depend on diffusion (Brownian motion) onto fibers as much as impaction, rather than completely on impaction like dust. A slower air speed gives diffusion more time for the particle to stick to the fiber or previously attached particles. Conversely, a higher filter speed may increase the collection of larger particles because impaction depends on the inertia of the particles. As a filter gets clogged from use, the fan air speed drops so that the effective CADR for smoke may actually rise rather than decrease, while the CADR for dust will be lower from the decrease in fan speed, especially because the particles fall out before they are filtered. If half the room's volume of air is exchanged with other rooms every hour, then HEPA filters are not more effective than dust spot 85% efficiency filters (roughly, MERV 13 or 3M's MPR 1900). The unit's fan speed will be the dominant factor if air from outside the room is coming in too quickly. History In the early 1980s, AHAM developed a method for measuring the clean air delivery rate for portable household electric room air cleaners. The resulting standard became an American National Standard in 1988 and was last revised in 2006. Known as ANSI/AHAM AC-1, it measures the air cleaner's ability to reduce tobacco smoke, dust and pollen particles in a room. It also includes a method for calculating the suggested room size.

The package was introduced by the Gillard Labor Government in February 2011 and was repealed by the Abbott Government on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014. History =Rudd Government= The Gillard Labor Government's legislation followed unsuccessful efforts by the Rudd Labor Government to secure passage of an ETS through the Australian Parliament. In opposition, Rudd had called climate change \\"the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time\\" and called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050. Both the incumbent Howard Government and the Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an ETS before the 2007 federal election. Labor won the election, and the Rudd government began negotiating the passage of an ETS through Parliament. The Opposition led by Brendan Nelson called for the vote on the government's ETS be delayed until after the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen in December 2009. Rudd said in response that it would be \\"an act of absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership not to act on climate change until other nations had done so\\" and the government pursued the early introduction of the Scheme. Failing to secure the support of the Australian Greens for their preferred model, the government entered negotiations with the new Liberal Opposition Leader, Malcolm Turnbull, and in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference, developed an amended Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), with the support of Turnbull. Following a party revolt by Coalition members opposed to the Scheme, and shortly before the carbon vote, Tony Abbott challenged for the leadership of the Liberal Party and narrowly defeated Turnbull. Thereafter the Coalition opposed the ETS outright and the government was unable to secure the support of other Senators for its CPRS. Abbott described Rudd's Emission Trading plan as a \\"Great big tax on everything\\" and opposed it. Abbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February, which committed the Coalition to a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an 'emissions reduction fund' to provide 'direct' incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions. Following the unsuccessful Copenhagen Conference, Rudd announced the deferral of the Scheme and elected not to take the matter to a double dissolution election. In June 2010, Rudd was replaced as leader of the Labor Party in an internal party leadership challenge and Julia Gillard became Prime Minister. Factional leader and key Gillard supporter Bill Shorten said that the sudden announcement of change of policy on the CPRS was a factor that had contributed to a collapse in support for Rudd's leadership. =Gillard Government= Following her election as party leader, in various policy announcements in the lead up to the 2010 election, Prime Minister Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan gave assurances that no carbon tax would be introduced by a Gillard led government, but that a \\"citizens' assembly\\" would be called to sound out public support for a price on carbon. The 2010 election resulted in a hung parliament in which Gillard secured the support of the Greens and three independents to form a government. On 28 September, in a joint press conference with the Greens, Gillard announced that a citizens assembly would not be held and that instead a \\"multi-party climate change committee\\" consisting of Labor, Greens and Independent members, would examine the issues. On 24 February 2011, in a joint press conference of the \\"Climate Change Committee\\" ‚Äì comprising the Government, Greens and two independent MPs ‚Äì Gillard announced a plan to legislate for the introduction of a fixed price to be imposed on \\"carbon pollution\\" from 1 July 2012 The carbon price would be placed for three to five years before a full emissions trading scheme is implemented, under a blueprint agreed by a multi-party parliamentary committee.(24 February 2011). Carbon price to begin from July 2012: Midday roundup . Retrieved 13 May 2012. Key issues remained to be negotiated between the Government and the cross-benches, including compensation arrangements for households and businesses, the carbon price level, the emissions reduction target and whether or not to include fuel in the tax. The Gillard Government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed was a broken election promise. The legislation was approved by the Lower House in October 2011 and by the Upper House in November 2011. The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the legislation if elected. Mechanism The Act begins on 1 July 2012, and operates on a financial year basis. It is administered by the Clean Energy Regulator and the responsible Minister. A carbon pollution cap limits the sum of: (a) the total number of auctioned carbon units; and (b) the total number of free carbon units issued in accordance with the Jobs and Competitiveness Program; and (c) the total number of free carbon units issued to coal-fired electricity generators. If a person (including a corporation) is responsible for covered emissions of greenhouse gas from the operation of a facility, the facility's annual emissions are above a threshold, and the person does not surrender one eligible emissions unit for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalence of the gas, the person is liable to pay unit shortfall charge. The financial years beginning on 1 July 2012, 1 July 2013 and 1 July 2014 are fixed charge years (otherwise known in popular terms as the 'carbon tax'). In a fixed charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act for a fixed charge. Later financial years are flexible charge years which involve emissions trading. In a flexible charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act as the result of an auction plus by means of free allocation to coal fired generators and emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) industries. However, in the flexible charge years beginning on 1 July 2015, 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2017, some carbon units may be issued for a fixed charge (to act as a cap). Furthermore, free carbon units will be issued under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program (which deals with emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities). Free carbon units will be issued to coal-fired electricity generators. If a carbon unit was not issued for a fixed charge, the unit is transferable. The Climate Change Authority will conduct periodic reviews of the Act. = Impacts = Under the scheme, around 500 entities will be required to buy permits for each tonne of CO2 emitted. Personal income tax will be reduced for those who earn less than $80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold increased from $6,000 to $18,200. In February 2012, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Clean Energy Future carbon price had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62 percent in 2010‚Äì2011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached $520 million in 2010‚Äì2011.

The Greek Septuagint, and both the Qumran and Masada Hebrew versions of Ben Sira conclude with a first-person character speaking in Wisdom's voice as in the Book of Proverbs, though it is not certain that this was not appended to Ben Sira from another work. A less clear personification of Wisdom is also found in the Cave 11 Psalm Scroll.Daniel J. Harrington Wisdom texts from Qumran - 1996 Page 28 \\"It is not crucial for our purposes to decide this debate. What is important is that in Sirach 51:13‚Äî30 we have evidence at Qumran for the vivid personification of Wisdom as a female figure\\" Wisdom literature is a genre of literature common in the ancient Near East. This genre is characterized by sayings of wisdom intended to teach about divinity and about virtue. The key principle of wisdom literature is that while techniques of traditional story-telling are used, books also presume to offer insight and wisdom about nature and reality. Old Testament and Jewish texts The Sapiential Books or \\"Books of Wisdom\\" is a term used in biblical studies to refer to a subset of the books of the Jewish Bible in the Septuagint version. There are seven of these books, namely the books of Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Book of Wisdom, the Song of Songs (Song of Solomon), and Sirach. Not all the Psalms are usually regarded as belonging to the Wisdom tradition. In Judaism, the Books of Wisdom are regarded as part of the Ketuvim or \\"Writings\\". In Christianity, Job, Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are included in the Old Testament by all traditions, while Wisdom, Song of Songs and Sirach are regarded in some traditions as deuterocanonical. Sapiential books are in the broad tradition of wisdom literature that was found widely in the Ancient Near East, and includes writings from many religions other than Judaism. =Septuagint= The Greek noun sophia is the translation of \\"wisdom\\" in the Greek Septuagint for Hebrew '. Wisdom is a central topic in the \\"sapiential\\" books, i.e. Proverbs, Psalms, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Book of Wisdom, Wisdom of Sirach, and to some extent Baruch (the last three are Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament.) =Philo and the Logos= Philo, a Hellenised Jew writing in Alexandria, attempted to harmonise Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by Stoic philosophical concepts, he used the Greek term logos, \\"word,\\" for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the Gospel of John in the opening verses and applied to Jesus Christ as the eternal Word (Logos) of God the Father.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. \\"John\\" p. 302-310 Jesus According to Perkins, in early Gnosticism (1st-2nd century CE) a wisdom tradition developed, in which Jesus' sayings were interpreted as pointers to an esoteric wisdom, in which the soul could be divinized through identification with wisdom. Perkins further said that a mythical story developed in early Gnosticism about the descent of a heavenly creature to reveal the Divine world as the true home of human beings. Jewish Christianity saw the Messiah, or Christ, as \\"an eternal aspect of God's hidden nature, his \\"spirit\\" and \\"truth,\\" who revealed himself throughout sacred history.\\" References Sources * Category:Book of Proverbs Category:Narrative techniques Category:Personifications ","title":"Wisdom (personification)"},{"id":"33275086","text":"The Razzie Award for Worst Musical Score was an award presented at the annual Golden Raspberry Awards for the worst score composed for a film in the previous year.

The program, hosted by Frank Nicotero, is based on the Milton Bradley board game The Game of Life. It ran from September 24, 2011, to April 15, 2012. Gameplay Two families of three compete for the chance to win the grand prize. =Round 1= Each team takes a turn \\"driving\\" the Game of Life car through a Life adventure of their choice. (The car actually faces a green screen animation, and can be shaken in various ways to simulate turns, bumps, and jumps in the \\"road\\".) After choosing one of the two adventures, the team faces a series of 50/50 questions at the forks in the road. The driver turns the wheel toward the fork they feel is the correct answer. Correct answers earn \\"Life points\\", while wrong answers stop the car for 5 seconds. Correct answers earn 100 Life points on the first question, then 200 for the second, and so on. The adventure continues until the car runs \\"out of gas\\" (time, about two minutes). =Round 2= Play remains the same as Round 1, usually with the second team going first. Life points are doubled in this round (200, 400, 600, etc.). In addition, the 3rd question (sometimes the 2nd one) of the adventure earns extra gas for the car in addition to its life point value, allowing the chance to answer more questions and possibly earn more life points who ever had the most life points get to spin a bonus prize. =Bonus Spin= The team with the highest score after Round 2 gets to spin a giant version of the Game of Life Spinner for a special bonus prize. If they can successfully predict whether the spinner will land on an odd or even number, they win the bonus prize. A consolation prize is awarded for a wrong guess. In the event of a tie, one team takes the odd numbers, while the other team takes the even numbers, and host Nicotero spins the spinner. The team that wins the spin receives the bonus prize; the other team receives the consolation prize. For season 2, they added a prize for each number on the spinner. =Round 3= Both teams compete simultaneously in a 60-second stunt. Each time the task in the stunt is completed successfully, 250 or 500 Life points are awarded to the teams. The teams wear special 'The Game of Life' T shirts, one team wore red the other team wore blue. The team with the highest total score at the end of this round wins and advances to the Grand Prize Round while the losing team receives a consolation prize. If both teams are tied with the same score at the end of round 3, the Bonus Spin is played again. =Grand Prize Round= The round takes place in two parts. In the first part, each member of the winning family was asked a \\"would you rather\\"-style question during the commercial break based on one of the three adventures they played during the show. The other two family members must predict which answer was given. Each right answer earns an extra number on the Game of Life Spinner. The team now faces the Game of Life Spinner one more time. The team again chooses between the odds and evens, plus any extra numbers of their choice that they earned. If the Spinner lands on any of the numbers that were chosen, the team wins the grand prize of a family vacation (except for the premiere, which had a 3-D family screening room). A consolation prize is again awarded for a wrong guess.

Chaplin's return to the United States restored his popularity and public reputation. Jeffrey Vance, author of the 2003 Chaplin biography, Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema, wrote that Chaplin's 1972 return to the United States, which was arranged by Rothman, was \\"one of the greatest P.R. coups, and personal rehabilitations\\" in the history of the film industry. Vance further wrote that, \\"Rothman is the guy who re-made Chaplin.\\" Biography =Career= Rothman was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on January 14, 1919, to Meyer and Molly Rotman. Rothman was one of his parents four children. His father worked as a kosher butcher. Rothman would later change his name from Moses to Mo once he entered the work force. Rothman served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, stationed in Dublin, Ireland. While in Ireland, Rothman began to meet Americans who worked in the film industry, who invited him to New York City to work in entertainment after the war. Rothman took their advice and moved to New York City after the end of the war. He worked for Universal Pictures from 1946 to 1952 as an overseas manager in India, Singapore and Venezuela. In 1952, Rothman joined United Artists' office in Paris, France, as the studio's continental European manager, where he worked from 1952 to 1959. Rothman was hired by Columbia Pictures in 1960 as the CEO of Columbia's international division. He rose to become Columbia Pictures' vice president for worldwide marketing. Rothman also served as Columbia Pictures' representative to director Stanley Kubrick during the production of his 1964 film, Dr. Strangelove. He retired from Columbia Pictures in 1971 to focus on the distribution of Charlie Chaplin's film library. =Charlie Chaplin= Charlie Chaplin, one of Hollywood's best known figures, had founded United Artists with Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks. By the early 1950s, Chaplin's stardom had dimmed due to perceived Communist sympathies and scandals involving his two previous, early marriages to sixteen-year-old girls. Chaplin, though a British citizen, had lived in the United States for forty years, but his political affiliations made him a subject of suspicion during the McCarthy Era. In 1952, Chaplin traveled to his native home to promote the London premiere of Limelight, the last film he made in the United States. While abroad, United States Attorney General James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and would not allow him to return to the United States. Chaplin moved to Switzerland in 1952, and swore never to return to the United States. Chaplin owned and retained the rights to most of his movies, which he took with him to Switzerland. Rothman's relationship to Chaplin stretched back to the 1950s, when he first met Chaplin while working as United Artists' European manager. In early 1971, a group of investors, led by Rothman, paid Chaplin $6 million, plus 50% royalties, for the distribution rights to some of his best known movies, including The Great Dictator, Limelight, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times. Rothman left his job as vice president of worldwide marketing for Columbia Pictures in 1971 to lead the investors and handle the distribution of Chaplin's films on a full-time basis. Rothman successfully persuaded Chaplin, who was 83 years old at the time, to return to the United States in order to promote the re-release of his film catalog. Chaplin was hesitant, but agreed to Rothman's offer. Charlie Chaplin, accompanied by both his wife, Oona, and Mo Rothman, arrived in New York City on April 2, 1972. Chaplin attended a tribute to his films held by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York. He was further awarded the honorary Academy Award one week later. The visit, orchestrated by Rothman, restored Chaplin's popularity and reputation.Vance, Jeffrey. Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003 pg. 355. . At the time, the New York Times noted Rothmam's extensive involvement with the visit describing Rothman as \\"abrupt and ingratiating five times in three minutes\\" ‚Äî as a kind of performance in its own right, evoking the manner of \\"the Hollywood tycoon of the 1930s.\\" Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine Chaplin, later wrote that Rothman was the \\"brave and clever reviver of Charlie Chaplin worldwide.\\" Chaplin died in 1977, his popularity restored. Rothman continued to release his films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During the mid-1980s, Rothman loaned the now defunct United States Information Agency twelve of Chaplin's films, which were screened at American embassies worldwide as an example of American film and art. =Later life= In 1982, Rothman was the recipient of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for his contributions to Italian cinema. He served as a judge for both the Venice Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival in 1985. Rothman was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease later in life. In 2001, his wife, Lyn Rothman, spurred on by her husband's diagnosis, founded the Parkinson's Appeal for Deep Brain Stimulation, based in London. Mo Rothman died from Parkinson's disease in Los Angeles on September 15, 2011, at the age 92. and is survived by his wife, Lyn Rothman, with whom he had been married for 37 years; three children from two previous marriages: Keith from his first marriage and Nicole and Monique from his second marriage to German actress Hanna Rucker (1923-1982); two stepchildren, Sebastian and Arabella; and seven grandchildren. He was interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Towards the middle, it met West Lake (a remnant of the old Red River, located near Qu√°n Th√°nh) and water from this lake was provided from there to the downstream. ƒê·∫°i nam nh·∫•t th·ªëng ch√≠ book (composed between the 19th century) wrote: :T√¥ River in eastern provinces (Hanoi) is a distributary of the Nh·ªã H√†, flowing in the northern provinces to the H∆∞∆°ng B√†i village's manhole gate, ƒê√¥ng Xu√¢n, Th·ªç X∆∞∆°ng district (the old river gate located in C·∫ßu G·ªó street, Ho√†n Ki·∫øm) moves to the western of Vinh Thuan district, to the Nghƒ©a ƒê√¥ rural communes and flows to the eastern district of T·ª´ Li√™m and Thanh Tr√¨ district, nearly 60 miles of winding, flowing into Nhu·ªá River in H√† Li·ªÖu rural communes.

McGann and starring Humphrey Bogart, Beverly Roberts, and Linda Perry. The film is based on the 1930 play Five Star Final by Louis Weitzenkorn and is a much shorter remake of the film Five Star Final (1931), which stars Edward G. Robinson. The main setting has been moved from a newspaper to a nationwide radio network whose owner, Bertram Reynolds, hungry for larger audiences, decides ‚Äúin the name of public good‚Äù to revive the memory of a twenty-year-old murder case, with tragic consequences. The cynical manager of programming, Sherry Scott (Humphrey Bogart), has a crisis of conscience when faced with the deadly results. Plot Abetted by his marketing manager, Mr. Banning (Clay Clement) United Broadcasting Company owner Bertram C. Reynolds decides to sacrifice quality for more profitable sensationalism by broadcasting a serial based on the twenty-year-old ‚ÄúGloria Pembrook murder case‚Äù. Sherry Scott (Humphrey Bogart), cynical manager of programming for the radio network, promises Reynolds ‚Äúthe hottest play you ever heard‚Äù, giving the assignment to a team that includes Dr. Leavenworth (Harry Hayden), a devious reporter with the manner of a clergyman. When Scott asks his secretary, Alma Ross (Beverly Roberts) her opinion of the project, she replies, ‚ÄúI think you can always get people interested in the crucifixion of a woman‚Äù. Not long after a jury found that she was justified in shooting her first husband, Gloria Pembroke had a daughter, Edith, and remarried. She is now Martha Carstairs. Edith (Linda Perry), who knows nothing, is about to marry Billy Sims (Carlyle Moore, Jr.), scion of a socially prominent family. The UBC announces the forthcoming series on Gloria Pembroke, alerting Martha and her devoted husband, Jim, to the threat to their family's happiness. Isolated from family and friends since their marriage, the Carstairs desperately seek help, while the young people remain blissfully ignorant. The Carstairs mistake Leavenworth for a pastor's associate and unburden themselves. Moments after he leaves their apartment, they are horrified to hear the radio advertising ‚ÄúSin Doesn't Pay by Dr. Martin Leavenworth.‚Äù Scott welcomes Leavenworth's report, and when Ross challenges him, he retorts that now he only cares about financial security. The Sims hear Leavenworth's morning broadcast and come to the Carstairs to cancel the wedding, without speaking to Malcolm. Martha calls UBC and appeals to Reynolds, who hangs up on her. In despair, she drinks poison. Carstairs finds an ally in Dr. McGuire, their pastor, whose eloquent appeal to the Association of Broadcasters leads the chairman to promise immediate action. The Federal Communications CommissionThe FCC was less than two years old when the film came out. will put Reynolds and his like out of business. When Jim returns home, he finds his wife's body. He sends Edith and Malcolm to the church, promising to follow with Martha, and kills himself. Scott and Ross hear the news of the suicides in the office. Later, Malcolm's parents browbeat Edith about ending the engagement; Malcolm comes in and defies them. Reynolds wants to cancel the series (and flee to England), but Banning says it is too profitable to cancel. Scott raises the specter of an FCC investigation of Reynold's muckraking. Leavenworth suggests giving Edith money, and they admit her to the office. Grief-stricken but under control, Edith demands of each of the four men, ‚ÄúWhy did you kill my mother?‚Äù Scott answers, truthfully, ‚Äúfor financial reasons... to sell time on the air.‚Äú Increasingly distraught, she draws a gun and shoots, wildly. Malcolm bursts in and takes her in his arms, telling her ‚ÄúThey'll go on with their filthy broadcasts, sacrificing little people who can‚Äôt fight back,‚Äù but warning the men that he will kill them if they use his name or his wife's again. Scott tells Reynolds: ‚ÄúYou thought up these murders and I committed them...All my life I'll see that girl standing there... I want you to wake up in the night and see your own squashy, putrid little soul... We take your money and we do your work because we are afraid to starve... I'm not.‚Äù Scott quits, taking Ross with him. The phone rings: It is the FCC. He eagerly agrees to testify, and when Reynold's ‚ÄúVoice of the People‚Äù broadcast begins, he throws a paperweight at the wall, smashing Reynold's portrait and the speaker behind it.

The film is much shorter than the original, running for 64 as opposed to 89 minutes. Although much of the dialogue is identical to that in Five Star Final (1931), that was a pre-code film, which ends with Edward G. Robinson's character telling his boss to ‚Äúshove it up his‚Äî‚Äú, throwing the telephone through a glass door on the last word. Character names have been changed. Although the fatal tragedy remains, the promised intervention of the newly formed Federal Communications Commission adds a ray of hope for the future that is not present in Five Star Final. Reception The New York Times' review compared the film to the original play, noting that it ‚Äúlacks the sincerity of purpose that distinguished the earlier work...

The program was based on the board game Scrabble and was hosted by Justin Willman. It ran from September 3, 2011, to April 15, 2012. Gameplay Two teams consisting of a parent and a child compete for the grand prize of tickets for a trip to anywhere in the world. The teams compete in a total of four rounds; winning any of the first three rounds earns a prize and two \\"Bonus Scrabble Tiles,\\" which provide an advantage in the final round; any time one of the first three rounds ends in a tie, both teams are awarded the prize and one \\"Bonus Scrabble Tile.\\" The team that wins the final round wins the game and the trip. =Rounds 1 & 2= Games played in rounds 1 and 2 rotate from show to show and include, \\"Scrabble Babble\\", \\"Scrabble Knockout\\", \\"Scrabble Slam\\", \\"Scrabble Scream\\", and \\"Speedword\\". Winning a game wins the team a prize and two \\"Bonus Scrabble Tiles\\". A coin toss before the show determines which team has the option to play or pass for the first game. Subsequently, the winner of the previous game gets the option for the next game. Scrabble Knockout The team that goes first picks one of two categories, leaving the other for the opponents. The team is shown a series of five words, one at a time. Each word has three extra letters added in; the first and last letters are always correct. Ex. LMOLVLIFPOP. The parent tells the child to knock out the incorrect letters; the parent tells the child which letter to knock out, and the child touches that letter on the screen. If the team tries to knock out an incorrect letter, then a klaxon sounds and the board locks up; the child must then press a plunger to reset the board before continuing to play. Answer: LOLLIPOP. The first team attempts to solve all five words as quickly as possible, with the clock counting up to a maximum of sixty seconds; the second team must beat the first team's time, or, if the first team did not get all five words, to solve more words. The team that solves their words faster wins the round. Scrabble Babble The parent is shown a three letter word with one of the letters being a blank tile (which can represent any letter). Ex. C A - The parent must think of a word and then describe the word to the child without blurting any part of the word or the full correct word. If a parent blurts out the part of the word, they get penalized and move to another word. If the parent blurts out the entire word, the game is over. The child must say the exact word that the parent is describing. If correct, a four letter word is shown and so on up to a seven letter word. The team that gets five words faster, or, failing that, the team that gets more words in 60 seconds, wins the round. Scrabble Scream In this round the team must unscramble a word together. Each word is divided into two parts; the first part is always three letters but the last part can be any length. One of the players unscrambles the first three letters of the word; when those three letters are unscrambled, the remaining three, four, or five letters are revealed for the other player, who must unscramble those letters and say the complete word. Ex. AES - - - - The first player would answer \\"S-E-A\\", once correct those letters would rearrange and the rest of the word is revealed. SEA KISC The partner must now say \\"S-I-C-K, SEASICK\\". After each word, the players switch places, so that the player who unscrambled the first part of the word now unscrambles the second part, and vice versa. As before, the first team is allowed up to 60 seconds to solve five words, and the second team must beat the first team's time/score. The team that solves their words faster wins the round. Scrabble Slam The players line up so that play alternates between teams. The first player presses a button to stop a randomizer, which sets the clock for the round (the clock is visible to the home audience, but not to the teams). A four-letter word appears on the screen, along with an extra letter. The players must use the extra letter and \\"slam\\" it over one of the letters in the original four letter word to make a new acceptable word. Ex. HUNK - T The player would say, \\"SLAM THE K\\" to make the word HUNT. When a player is correct play passes to the next player. When time runs out, the player who has control is eliminated from the round. For subsequent rounds, the next player in line after the eliminated player sets the time limit for the round as before; the last team to still have a player in the game, wins. Scrabble Speedword This game appears in only one episode. A team stands in front of a huge game board that consists of a series of five individual letters on screens. The board consists of a series of tracks the screens can move within. At any given time three screens can be at the top, two in the center and three at the bottom. The child stands at the board and with 30 seconds on the clock the parent yells out a three letter word that can be formed by the five letters in the board. The child must maneuver the letter screens in the track so the three letter word appears at the bottom of the game board. The team scores one point for each word they make and the opponents then try to beat that score. =Round 3: Scrabble Flash= There are a handful of episodes in which \\"Scrabble Flash\\" is played first and the minigames are played in rounds 2 and 3 but for most episodes, Round 3 is always \\"Scrabble Flash\\". In this round, the team is given five over-sized Scrabble Flash cubes, each with a different letter. The first team has thirty seconds to make as many words as possible; each word must contain at least three letters, and each valid word is worth one point for each letter used; there is at least one valid five-letter word. Both teams play the same set of letters; the team that is to go second is isolated while the first team plays. The team with the higher score wins a prize and two \\"Bonus Scrabble Tiles.\\" =Final Round: Scrabble Lightning= Before the round begins, a set of 16 letter tiles are placed on the board. A randomizer then causes tiles to light up. Each team is allowed to stop the randomizer; a team starts the final round with the regulation value of the tiles that they stop the randomizer on; the number of tiles that the randomizer lights up is the number of \\"Bonus Scrabble Tiles\\" that the team had earned from the three previous rounds. This becomes their \\"head start\\" score before playing \\"Scrabble Lightning\\". The game is played on a regulation Scrabble board with only the double and triple-word score spaces (the double and triple-letter score spaces are removed). A scrambled-up word appears on the board. The host then reads a clue to that word. The first player to buzz-in with the correct word earns the regulation value of that word (doubled or tripled if one of the letters is on a double or triple-word score space). Players must wait until the host finishes reading the clue before buzzing in. The children play the first word. They alternate words with their parents from then on. The first team to reach 100 points or more, or the team in the lead when time is called when that objective is not reached, wins the game and the grand prize trip.

The decree issued as Ministry of Religious Affairs decree No. 9 of 2006 and Ministry of Home Affairs decree No. 8 of 2006. A translation of the full title is \\"Regulation of Duties of Regional Head and Deputy in Maintaining Religious Harmony, Empowering the Forum of Religious Harmony, and Constructing Places of Worship\\".  Background  The decree is a revision of a joint decreeSurat Keputusan Bersama Menag dan Mendagri Nomor 1/1969. Also referred to as \\"Joint Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs and the Minister of Home Affairs No.1/BER/MDN-MAD/1969 concerning the Implementation of the Task of Government Officials to Ensure the Order and Undisturbed Implementation of the Religious Development and Practices by its Adherents\\". issued in 1969 by the Indonesian Home Affairs Minister and Religious Affairs Minister and which covers building houses of prayer. In 1967-1969, churches were attacked, sometimes destroyed, on Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Java. These violent episodes appeared to have been triggered by construction of buildings for religious minorities. In response, on 13 September 1969, the Ministers of Religion and Home Affairs issued Joint Ministerial Decree 1/1969 to control construction of places of worship and to govern religious practices in general.  Requirements  According to Article 14 of the 2006 decree, a permit for constructing a house of worship should issue when the applicant obtains: * a list of 90 members of the proto-congregation; * signatures from 60 local households of a different faith; * a written recommendation from the regency or municipal religious affairs office; * a written recommendation from the local interfaith harmony forum (FKUBJoint Forum for Religious Tolerance or Forum Kerukunan Umat Beragama in Indonesian); and * approval from the subdistrict head. Article 14 requires local governments to find an alternative or temporary venue for services if the group cannot meet one of the requirements. Article 21 requires that local governments fairly mediate disputes. Includes translated portions of Articles 13, 14, and 21.  Concerns  While the government of Indonesia asserted that the purpose of the 2006 decree was to reduce inter-faith conflict, many persons and organizations assert that the decree is unconstitutional, is contrary to treaties ratified by Indonesia, and has increased inter-faith conflict and the ability of a region's majority faith to suppress other faiths. Others note that the decree's requirements create opportunities for corruption. Specific concerns raised regarding the 2006 decree include: # Aggressive religious organizations apply pressure on and pay locals to not sign or rescind signatures of petitions. # The FKUB is not an elected body and is dominated by the local majority religion. Where such majority practitioners are intolerant of other religions, the FKUB effectively vetoes construction of minority religious buildings. # Aggressive religious organizations apply pressure on regional entities to not provide recommendations or approve permits for which applicants have otherwise qualified. # Even if all requirements are met, certain officials have stated that they will not issue permits if any local objections remain. # Even if the permit is issued, vociferous responses from militant groups have caused local officials to rescind permits or to not protect the applicant's ability to construct or use the building. # After using FKUB or political influence to prevent issuance of a permit, extremist groups use failure to obtain a permit as a pretext for attacking the applicant congregation when it attempts to meet at the site or elsewhere. On the other hand, some (including minority religious organizations) have suggested that the 2006 decree is better than nothing. Such organizations note that the decree provides a minority religious organization with at least a legal argument that it is entitled to a permit.

The command is substituted in-line, where a file name would normally occur, by the command shell. This allows programs that normally only accept files to directly read from or write to another program. History Process substitution was available as a compile-time option for \`ksh88\`, the 1988 version of the Korn shell from Bell Labs. The rc shell provides the feature as \\"pipeline branching\\" in Version 10 Unix, released in 1990. The Bash shell provided process substitution no later than version 1.14, released in 1994. Available in the Gnu source archive of version 1.14.7 as of 12 February 2016. Example The following examples use Korn shell syntax. The Unix diff command normally accepts the names of two files to compare, or one file name and standard input. Process substitution allows one to compare the output of two programs directly: $ diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2) The \`<(command)\` expression tells the command interpreter to run command and make its output appear as a file. The command can be any arbitrarily complex shell command. Without process substitution, the alternatives are: Both alternatives are more cumbersome. Process substitution can also be used to capture output that would normally go to a file, and redirect it to the input of a process. The Bash syntax for writing to a process is \`>(command)\`. Here is an example using the \`tee\`, \`wc\` and \`gzip\` commands that counts the lines in a file with \`wc -l\` and compresses it with \`gzip\` in one pass: $ tee >(wc -l >&2) < bigfile  gzip > bigfile.gz Advantages The main advantages of process substitution over its alternatives are: * Simplicity: The commands can be given in-line; there is no need to save temporary files or create named pipes first. * Performance: Reading directly from another process is often faster than having to write a temporary file to disk, then read it back in. This also saves disk space. * Parallelism: The substituted process can be running concurrently with the command reading its output or writing its input, taking advantage of multiprocessing to reduce the total time for the computation. Mechanism Under the hood, process substitution has two implementations. On systems which support \`/dev/fd\` (most Unix-like systems) it works by calling the \`pipe()\` system call, which returns a file descriptor \`$fd\` for a new anonymous pipe, then creating the string \`/dev/fd/$fd\`, and substitutes that on the command line. On systems without \`/dev/fd\` support, it calls \`mkfifo\` with a new temporary filename to create a named pipe, and substitutes this filename on the command line. To illustrate the steps involved, consider the following simple command substitution on a system with \`/dev/fd\` support: $ diff file1 <(sort file2) The steps the shell performs are: # Create a new anonymous pipe. This pipe will be accessible with something like \`/dev/fd/63\`; you can see it with a command like \`echo <(true)\`. # Execute the substituted command in the background (\`sort file2\` in this case), piping its output to the anonymous pipe. # Execute the primary command, replacing the substituted command with the path of the anonymous pipe. In this case, the full command might expand to something like \`diff file1 /dev/fd/63\`. # When execution is finished, close the anonymous pipe. For named pipes, the execution differs solely in the creation and deletion of the pipe; they are created with \`mkfifo\` (which is given a new temporary file name) and removed with \`unlink\`. All other aspects remain the same. Limitations Process substitution has some limitations: * No file seeking: the \\"files\\" created are not seekable, which means the process reading or writing to the file cannot perform random access; it must read or write once from start to finish. Programs that explicitly check the type of a file before opening it may refuse to work with process substitution, because the \\"file\\" resulting from process substitution is not a regular file. * No exit codes: \\"It is not possible to obtain the exit code of a process substitution command from the shell that created the process substitution.\\" See also * Pipeline (Unix) * Named pipe * Command substitution * Comparison of command shells * Anonymous pipe References Further reading  Category:Programming language topics Category:Unix programming tools ","title":"Process substitution"},{"id":"33275452","text":"Raymond John Leppan (born 20 July 1979) is a retired South African professional wrestler who is best known for his time in WWE as Adam Rose. Making his debut on the South African independent circuit in 1995, Leppan signed with WWE in 2010, wrestling in its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Leo Kruger, where he became a two-time FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion. After FCW folded in 2012, Leppan continued to wrestle in its successor NXT as Leo Kruger, before moving to WWE's main roster, as Adam Rose in early 2014. After a series of scandals, Leppan was released by the promotion in April 2016 and wrestled in the international independent circuit until his retirement in June 2019.  Early life  According to his wife, Adam wanted to wrestle from the age of 10. A school drop-out, Leppan ran away from home when he was 14, then spent two years living on the streets and in abandoned buildings.

Leppan also said that he had rejected being part of a family despite having loving parents. Leppan's mother later successfully managed to entice Leppan to return home to Johannesburg from Durban with the prospect of beginning wrestling classes.

From 1920 to 1924 he was president of the Ballarat Trades and Labour Council (he would hold the position again from 1947 to 1956). In 1924 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for Ballarat East; he transferred to Ballarat in 1927, and was defeated in 1932. He made unsuccessful attempts to return to politics via a by-election for Allandale in 1933, Ballarat in 1935, and the Senate in 1940. McAdam died at Ballarat in 1967 and is buried in Ballaarat Old Cemetery.

Gnosticism is a 17th-century term expanding the definition of Irenaeus' groups to include other syncretic and mystery religions. In Gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of God. Gnostics held that she was the syzygy (female twin divine Aeon) of Jesus (i.e. the Bride of Christ), and Holy Spirit of the Trinity. She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew equivalent of Acham≈çth (, chokhmah) and as Prunikos (). In the Nag Hammadi texts, Sophia is the lowest Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation of the light of God. She is considered to have fallen from grace in some way, in so doing creating or helping to create the material world. Gnostic mythos Almost all Gnostic systems of the Syrian or Egyptian type taught that the universe began with an original, unknowable God, referred to as the Parent or Bythos, or as the Monad by Monoimus. From this initial unitary beginning, the One spontaneously emanated further Aeons, being pairs of progressively 'lesser' beings in sequence. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma, or fullness, of God, and thus should not be seen as distinct from the divine, but symbolic abstractions of the divine nature. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in one of the Aeons. In most versions of the Gnostic mythos, it is Sophia who brings about this instability in the Pleroma, in turn bringing about the creation of materiality. According to some Gnostic texts, the crisis occurs as a result of Sophia trying to emanate without her syzygy or, in another tradition, because she tries to breach the barrier between herself and the unknowable Bythos. After cataclysmically falling from the Pleroma, Sophia's fear and anguish of losing her life (just as she lost the light of the One) causes confusion and longing to return to it. Because of these longings, matter (Greek: hylƒì, ·ΩïŒªŒ∑) and soul (Greek: psychƒì, œàœÖœáŒÆ) accidentally come into existence. The creation of the Demiurge (also known as Yaldabaoth, \\"Son of Chaos\\") is also a mistake made during this exile. The Demiurge proceeds to create the physical world in which we live, ignorant of Sophia, who nevertheless manages to infuse some spiritual spark or pneuma into his creation. In the Pistis Sophia, Christ is sent from the Godhead in order to bring Sophia back into the fullness (Pleroma). Christ enables her to again see the light, bringing her knowledge of the spirit (Greek: pneuma, œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±). Christ is then sent to earth in the form of the man Jesus to give men the Gnosis needed to rescue themselves from the physical world and return to the spiritual world. In Gnosticism, the Gospel story of Jesus is itself allegorical: it is the Outer Mystery, used as an introduction to Gnosis, rather than it being literally true in a historical context. For the Gnostics, the drama of the redemption of the Sophia through Christ or the Logos is the central drama of the universe. The Sophia resides in all humans as the Divine Spark. Book of Proverbs Jewish Alexandrine religious philosophy was much occupied with the concept of the Divine Sophia, as the revelation of God's inward thought, and assigned to her not only the formation and ordering of the natural universe (comp. Clem. Hom. xvi. 12) but also the communication of knowledge to mankind. In Wisdom (the noun is feminine) is described as God's Counsellor and Workmistress (Master-workman, R.V.), who dwelt beside Him before the Creation of the world and sported continually before Him. In accordance with the description given in the Book of Proverbs, a dwelling- place was assigned by the Gnostics to the Sophia, and her relation to the upper world defined as well as to the seven planetary powers which were placed under her. The seven planetary spheres or heavens were for the ancients the highest regions of the created universe. They were thought of as seven circles rising one above another, and dominated by the seven Archons. These constituted the (Gnostic) Hebdomad. Above the highest of them, and over- vaulting it, was the Ogdoad, the sphere of immutability, which was nigh to the spiritual world (Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromata, iv. 25, 161; comp. vi. 16, 138 sqq.). Now we read in : These seven pillars being interpreted as the planetary heavens, the habitation of the Sophia herself was placed above the Hebdomad in the Ogdoad (Excerpt. ex Theodot. 8, 47). It is said further of the same divine wisdom (): This meant, according to the Gnostic interpretation, that the Sophia has her dwelling-place \\"on the heights\\" above the created universe, in the place of the midst, between the upper and lower world, between the Pleroma and the ektismena. She sits at \\"the gates of the mighty,\\" i.e. at the approaches to the realms of the seven Archons, and at the \\"entrances\\" to the upper realm of light her praise is sung. The Sophia is therefore the highest ruler over the visible universe, and at the same time the mediatrix between the upper and the lower realms. She shapes this mundane universe after the heavenly prototypes, and forms the seven star-circles with their Archons under whose dominion are placed, according to the astrological conceptions of antiquity, the fates of all earthly things, and more especially of man. She is \\"the mother\\" or \\"the mother of the living.\\" (Epiph. Haer. 26, 10). As coming from above, she is herself of pneumatic essence, the mƒìtƒìr ph≈çteinƒì (Epiph. 40, 2) or the an≈ç dynamis (Epiph. 39, 2) from which all pneumatic souls draw their origin. Descent In reconciling the doctrine of the pneumatic nature of the Sophia with the dwelling-place assigned her, according to the Proverbs, in the kingdom of the midst, and so outside the upper realm of light, there was envisioned a descent of Sophia from her heavenly home, the Pleroma, into the void (ken≈çma) beneath it. The concept was that of a seizure or robbery of light, or of an outburst and diffusion of light-dew into the ken≈çma, occasioned by a vivifying movement in the upper world. But inasmuch as the light brought down into the darkness of this lower world was thought of and described as involved in suffering, this suffering must be regarded as a punishment. This inference was further aided by the Platonic notion of a spiritual fall. Mythos of the soul Alienated through their own fault from their heavenly home, souls have sunk down into this lower world without utterly losing the remembrance of their former state, and filled with longing for their lost inheritance, these fallen souls are still striving upwards. In this way the mythos of the fall of Sophia can be regarded as having a typical significance. The fate of the \\"mother\\" was regarded as the prototype of what is repeated in the history of all individual souls, which, being of a heavenly pneumatic origin, have fallen from the upper world of light their home, and come under the sway of evil powers, from whom they must endure a long series of sufferings until a return into the upper world be once more vouchsafed them. But whereas, according to the Platonic philosophy, fallen souls still retain a remembrance of their lost home, this notion was preserved in another form in Gnostic circles. It was taught that the souls of the Pneumatici, having lost the remembrance of their heavenly derivation, required to become once more partakers of Gnosis, or knowledge of their own pneumatic essence, in order to make a return to the realm of light. In the impartation of this Gnosis consists the redemption brought and vouchsafed by Christ to pneumatic souls. But the various fortunes of such souls were wont to be contemplated in those of Sophia, and so it was taught that the Sophia also needed the redemption wrought by Christ, by whom she is delivered from her agnoia and her pathe, and will, at the end of the world's development, be again brought back to her long lost home, the Upper Pleroma, into which this mother will find an entrance along with all pneumatic souls her children, and there, in the heavenly bridal chamber, celebrate the marriage feast of eternity. Syrian Gnosis The Sophia mythos has in the various Gnostic systems undergone great variety of treatment. The oldest, the Syrian Gnosis, referred to the Sophia the formation of the lower world and the production of its rulers the Archons; and along with this they also ascribed to her the preservation and propagation of the spiritual seed. =Formation of the lower world = Rosenkreuzer, Altona, 1785. As described by Irenaeus, the great Mother-principle of the universe appears as the first woman, the Holy Spirit (r≈´ha d'qudshƒÅ) moving over the waters, and is also called the mother of all living. Under her are the four material elements‚Äîwater, darkness, abyss, and chaos. With her, combine themselves into two supreme masculine lights, the first and the second man, the Father and the Son, the latter being also designated as the Father's ennoia. From their union proceeds the third imperishable light, the third man, Christ. But unable to support the abounding fullness of this light, the mother in giving birth to Christ, suffers a portion of this light to overflow on the left side. While, then, Christ as dexios (He of the right hand) mounts upward with his mother into the imperishable Aeon, that other light which has overflowed on the left hand, sinks down into the lower world, and there produces matter. And this is the Sophia, called also Aristera (she of the left hand), Prouneikos and the male- female. There is here, as yet, no thought of a fall, properly so called, as in the Valentinian system. The power which has thus overflowed leftwards, makes a voluntary descent into the lower waters, confiding in its possession of the spark of true light. It is, moreover, evident that though mythologically distinguished from the humectatio luminis (Greek: ikmas ph≈çtos, ·º∞Œ∫Œº·Ω∞œÇ œÜœâœÑœåœÇ), the Sophia is yet, really nothing else but the light-spark coming from above, entering this lower material world, and becoming here the source of all formation, and of both the higher and the lower life. She swims over the waters, and sets their hitherto immoveable mass in motion, driving them into the abyss, and taking to herself a bodily form from the hylƒì. She compasses about, and is laden with material every kind of weight and substance, so that, but for the essential spark of light, she would be sunk and lost in the material. Bound to the body which she has assumed and weighed down thereby, she seeks in vain to make her escape from the lower waters, and hasten upwards to rejoin her heavenly mother. Not succeeding in this endeavour, she seeks to preserve, at least, her light-spark from being injured by the lower elements, raises herself by its power to the realm of the upper region, and there spreading herself out she forms out of her own bodily part, the dividing wall of the visible firmament, but still retains the aquatilis corporis typus. Finally seized with a longing for the higher light, she finds, at length, in herself, the power to raise herself even above the heaven of her own forming, and to fully lay aside her corporeity. The body thus abandoned is called \\"Woman from Woman.\\" =Creation and redemption= The narrative proceeds to tell of the formation of the seven Archons by Sophia herself, of the creation of man, which \\"the mother\\" (i.e. not the first woman, but the Sophia) uses as a mean to deprive the Archons of their share of light, of the perpetual conflict on his mother's part with the self-exalting efforts of the Archons, and of her continuous striving to recover again and again the light-spark hidden in human nature, till, at length, Christ comes to her assistance and in answer to her prayers, proceeds to draw all the sparks of light to Himself, unites Himself with the Sophia as the bridegroom with the bride, descends on Jesus who has been prepared, as a pure vessel for His reception, by Sophia, and leaves him again before the crucifixion, ascending with Sophia into the world or Aeon which will never pass away (Irenaeus, i. 30; Epiph. 37, 3, sqq.; Theodoret, h. f. i. 14). =As world-soul= In this system the original cosmogonic significance of the Sophia still stands in the foreground. The antithesis of Christus and Sophia, as He of the right (ho dexios) and She of the Left (hƒì aristera), as male and female, is but a repetition of the first Cosmogonic Antithesis in another form. The Sophia herself is but a reflex of the \\"Mother of all living\\" and is therefore also called \\"Mother.\\" She is the formatrix of heaven and earth, for as much as mere matter can only receive form through the light which, coming down from above has interpenetrated the dark waters of the hylƒì; but she is also at the same time the spiritual principle of life in creation, or, as the world-soul the representative of all that is truly pneumatic in this lower world: her fates and experiences represent typically those of the pneumatic soul which has sunk down into chaos. Prunikos In the Gnostic system described by Irenaeus (I. xxi.; see Ophites) the name Prunikos several times takes the place of Sophia in the relation of her story. The name Prunikos is also given to Sophia in the account of the kindred Barbeliot system, given in the preceding chapter of Irenaeus. Celsus, who shows that he had met with some Ophite work, exhibits acquaintance with the name Prunikos (Orig. Adv. Cels. vi. 34) a name which Origen recognizes as Valentinian. That this Ophite name had really been adopted by the Valentinians is evidenced by its occurrence in a Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Epiph. Haer. xxxi. 5). Epiphanius also introduces Prunikos as a technical word in the system of the Simonians (Epiph. Haer. xxi. 2) of those whom he describes under the head of Nicolaitans (Epiph. Haer. xxv. 3, 4) and of the Ophites (Epiph. Haer. xxxvii. 4, 6). =Etymology= Neither Irenaeus nor Origen indicates that he knew anything as to the meaning of this word; and we have no better information on this subject than a conjecture of Epiphanius (Epiph. Haer. xxv. 48). He says that the word means \\"wanton\\" or \\"lascivious,\\" for that the Greeks had a phrase concerning a man who had debauched a girl, Eprounikeuse tautƒìn. One feels some hesitation in accepting this explanation. Epiphanius was deeply persuaded of the filthiness of Gnostic morals, and habitually put the worst interpretation on their language. If the phrase reported by Epiphanius had been common, it is strange that instances of its use should not have been quoted from the Greek comic writers. It need not be denied that Epiphanius had heard the phrase employed, but innocent words come to be used in an obscene sense, as well by those who think double entendre witty, as by those who modestly avoid the use of plainer language. The primary meaning of the word prouneikos seems to be a porter, or bearer of burdens, the derivation being from enenkein, the only derivation indeed that the word seems to admit of. Then, modifying its meaning like the word agoraios, it came to be used in the sense of a turbulent violent person. The only distinct confirmation of the explanation of Epiphanius is that Hesychius (s. v. Skitaloi) has the words aphrodisi≈çn kai tƒìs prounikias tƒìs nykterinƒìs. This would be decisive, if we could be sure that these words were earlier in date than Epiphanius. In favour of the explanation of Epiphanius is the fact, that in the Gnostic cosmogonical myths, the imagery of sexual passion is constantly introduced. It seems on the whole probable that prouneikos is to be understood in the sense of propherƒìs which has for one of its meaningsSee the references in Liddell and Scott. \\"precocious in respect of sexual intercourse.\\" According to Ernst Wilhelm M√∂ller (1860) the name is possibly meant to indicate her attempts to entice away again from the lower Cosmic Powers the seed of Divine light. In the account given by Epiphanius (Haer. 37:6) the allusion to enticements to sexual intercourse which is involved in this name, becomes more prominent. However, in the Exegesis on the Soul text found at Nag Hammadi, the soul is likened to a woman which fell from perfection into prostitution, and that the Father will elevate her again to her original perfect state. In this context, the female personification of the soul resembles the passion of Sophia as Prunikos. The womb, mƒìtra Nigh related to this is the notion widely diffused among Gnostic sects of the impure mƒìtra (womb) whence the whole world is supposed to have issued. As according to the Italian Valentinians the Soter opens the mƒìtra of the lower Sophia, (the Enthymƒìsis), and so occasions the formation of the universe (Iren. I. 3, 4) so on the other hand the mƒìtra itself is personified. So Epiphanius reports the following cosmogony as that of a branch of the Nicolaitans: The Sethians (Hippolytus. Philosophum. v. 7) teach in like manner that from the first concurrence (syndromƒì) of the three primeval principles arose heaven and earth as a megalƒì tis idea sphragidos. These have the form of a mƒìtra with the omphalos in the midst. The pregnant mƒìtra therefore contains within itself all kinds of animal forms in the reflex of heaven and earth and all substances found in the middle region. This mƒìtra also encounters us in the great Apophasis ascribed to Simon where it is also called Paradise and Eden as being the locality of man's formation. These cosmogonic theories have their precedent in the Thalatth or Tiamat of Syrian mythology, the life-mother of whom Berossus has so much to relate, or in the world-egg out of which when cloven asunder heaven and earth and all things proceed. The name of this Berossian Thalatth meets us again among the Peratae of the Philosophumena (Hippolytus, Philosophum. v. 9) and is sometimes mistakenly identified with that of the sea‚Äîthalassa. Baruch‚ÄìGnosis A similar part to that of the mƒìtra is played by Edem, consort of Elohim in Justin's Gnostic book Baruch (Hippolytus, Philosoph. v. 18 sqq.) who there appears as a two-shaped being formed above as a woman and from the middle downwards as a serpent (21). Among the four and twenty Angels which she bears to Elohim, and which form the world out of her members, the second female angelic form is called Acham≈çs [Acham≈çth]. Like to this legend of the Philosophumena concerning the Baruch- Gnosis is that which is related by Epiphanius of an Ophite Party that they fabled that a Serpent from the Upper World had had sexual intercourse with the Earth as with a woman (Epiphanius, Haer. 45: 1 cf. 2).  Barbeliotae  Very nigh related to the doctrines of the Gnostics in Irenaeus are the views of the so-called Barbeliotae (Iren. I. 29). The name Barbelo, which according to one interpretation is a designation of the upper Tetrad, has originally nothing to do with the Sophia. This latter Being called also Spiritus Sanctus and Prunikos is the offspring of the first angel who stands at the side of the Monogenes. Sophia seeing that all the rest have each its syzygos within the Pleroma, desires also to find such a consort for herself; and not finding one in the upper world she looks down into the lower regions and being still unsatisfied there she descends at length against the will of the Father into the deep. Here she forms the Demiurge (the Proarch≈çn), a composite of ignorance and self-exaltation. This Being, by virtue of pneumatic powers stolen from his mother, proceeds to form the lower world. The mother, on the other hand, flees away into the upper regions and makes her dwelling there in the Ogdoad. The Ophites We meet this Sophia also among the Ophiana whose \\"Diagram\\" is described by Celsus and Origen, as well as among various Gnostic (Ophite) parties mentioned by Epiphanius. She is there called Sophia or Prunikos, the upper mother and upper power, and sits enthroned above the Hebdomad (the seven Planetary Heavens) in the Ogdoad (Origen, Against Celsus. vi. 31, 34, 35, 38; Epiphan. Haer. 25, 3 sqq. 26, 1,10. 39, 2 ; 40, 2). She is also occasionally called Parthenos (Orig. c. Cels. vi. 31) and again is elsewhere identified with the Barbelo or Barbero (Epiph. Haer. 25, 3 ; 26, 1, 10). Simon Magus Helen on the Ramparts of Troy by Frederick Leighton; an incarnation of the Ennoia in the Simonian system. =The Ennoia= This mythos of the soul and her descent into this lower world, with her various sufferings and changing fortunes until her final deliverance, recurs in the Simonian system under the form of the All-Mother who issues as its first thought from the Hest≈çs or highest power of God. She generally bears the name Ennoia, but is also called Wisdom (Sophia), Ruler, Holy Spirit, Prunikos, Barbelo. Having sunk down from the highest heavens into the lowest regions, she creates angels and archangels, and these again create and rule the material universe. Restrained and held down by the power of this lower world, she is hindered from returning to the kingdom of the Father. According to one representation she suffers all manner of insult from the angels and archangels bound and forced again and again into fresh earthly bodies, and compelled for centuries to wander in ever new corporeal forms. According to another account she is in herself incapable of suffering, but is sent into this lower world and undergoes perpetual transformation in order to excite by her beauty the angels and powers, to impel them to engage in perpetual strife, and so gradually to deprive them of their store of heavenly light. The Hest≈çs himself at length comes down from the highest heaven in a phantasmal body in order to deliver the suffering Ennoia, and redeem the souls held in captivity by imparting gnosis to them. =The lost sheep= The most frequent designation of the Simonian Ennoia is \\"the lost\\" or \\"the wandering sheep.\\" The Greek divinities Zeus and Athena were interpreted to signify Hest≈çs and his Ennoia, and in like manner the Tyrian sun-god Herakles-Melkart and the moon-goddess Selene-Astarte. So also the Homeric Helena, as the cause of quarrel between Greeks and Trojans, was regarded as a type of the Ennoia. The story which the fathers of the church handed down of the intercourse of Simon Magus with his consort Helena (Iren. i. 23; Tertullian de Anima, 34; Epiphanius Haer. 21; Pseudo-Tertullian Haer. 1; Philaster, Haer. 29; Philos. vi. 14, 15; Recogn. Clem. ii. 12; Hom. ii. 25), had probably its origin in this allegorical interpretation, according to Richard Adelbert Lipsius (1867). =Hest≈çs= In the Simonian Apophasis the great dynamis (also called Nous) and the great epinoia which gives birth to all things form a syzygy, from which proceeds the male-female Being, who is called Hest≈çs (Philos. vi. 13). Elsewhere nous and epinoia are called the upper-most of the three Simonian Syzygies, to which the Hest≈çs forms the Hebdomad: but on the other hand, nous and epinoia are identified with heaven and earth (Philos. vi. 9sqq.). Valentinus \\"Pl√©rome de Valentin,\\" from Histoire critique du Gnosticisme; Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II. The most significant development of this Sophia mythos is found in the Valentinian system. The descent of the Sophia from the Pleroma is ascribed after Plato's manner to a fall, and as the final cause of this fall a state of suffering is indicated which has penetrated into the Pleroma itself. Sophia or Mƒìtƒìr is in the doctrine of Valentinus the last, i.e. the thirtieth Aeon in the Pleroma, from which having fallen out, she now in remembrance of the better world which she has thus forsaken, gives birth to the Christus \\"with a shadow\\" (meta skias tinos). While Christus returns to the Pleroma, Sophia forms the Demiurge and this whole lower world out of the skia, a right and a left principle (Iren. Haer. i. 11, 1). For her redemption comes down to Sophia either Christus himself (Iren. i. 15, 3) or the Soter (Iren. i. 11, 1, cf. exc. ex Theod. 23; 41), as the common product of the Aeons, in order to bring her back to the Pleroma and unite her again with her syzygos. =Motive= The motive for the Sophia's fall was defined according to the Anatolian school to have lain therein, that by her desire to know what lay beyond the limits of the knowable she had brought herself into a state of ignorance and formlessness. Her suffering extends to the whole Pleroma. But whereas this is confirmed thereby in fresh strength, the Sophia is separated from it and gives birth outside it (by means of her ennoia, her recollections of the higher world), to the Christus who at once ascends into the Pleroma, and after this she produces an ousia amorphos, the image of her suffering, out of which the Demiurge and the lower world come into existence; last of all looking upwards in her helpless condition, and imploring light, she finally gives birth to the spermata tƒìs ekklƒìsias, the pneumatic souls. In the work of redemption the Soter comes down accompanied by the masculine angels who are to be the future syzygoi of the (feminine) souls of the Pneumatici, and introduces the Sophia along with these Pneumatici into the heavenly bridal chamber (Exc. ex Theod. 29‚Äì42; Iren. i. 2, 3). The same view, essentially meets us in the accounts of Marcus, (Iren. i. 18, 4; cf. 15, 3; 16, 1, 2; 17, 1) and in the Epitomators of the Syntagma of Hippolytus (Pseudo-Tertullian Haer. 12; Philaster, Haer. 38). Acham≈çth The Italic school distinguished on the other hand a two-fold Sophia, the ano Sophia and the kat≈ç Sophia or Achamoth. =Ptolemaeus= Fall According to the doctrine of Ptolemaeus and that of his disciples, the former of these separates herself from her syzygos, the thelƒìtos through her audacious longing after immediate Communion with the Father of all, falls into a condition of suffering, and would completely melt away in this inordinate desire, unless the Horos had purified her from her suffering and established her again in the Pleroma. Her enthymƒìsis, on the other hand, the desire which has obtained the mastery over her and the consequent suffering becomes an amorphos kai aneideos ousia, which is also called an ektr≈çma, is separated from her and is assigned a place beyond the limits of the Pleroma. The place of the Midst From her dwelling-place above the Hebdomad, in the place of the Midst, she is also called Ogdoad (·ΩàŒ≥Œ¥ŒøŒ¨œÇ), and further entitled Mƒìtƒìr, Sophia also, and he Hierousalƒìm, Pneuma hagion, and (arsenik≈çs) Kyrios. In these names some partial reminiscences of the old Ophitic Gnosis are retained. Repentance The Achamoth first receives (by means of Christus and Pneuma hagion the Pair of Aeons within the Pleroma whose emanation is most recent), the morph≈çsis kat' ousian. Left alone in her suffering she has become endued with penitent mind (epistrophƒì). Now descends the son as the common fruit of the Pleroma, gives her the morph≈çsis kata gn≈çsin, and forms out of her various affections the Demiurge and the various constituents of this lower world. By his appointment the Achamoth produces the pneumatic seed (the ekklƒìsia). Redemption The end of the world's history is here also (as above) the introduction of the lower Sophia with all her pneumatic offspring into the Pleroma, and this intimately connected with the second descent of the Soter and his transient union with the psychical Christus; then follows the marriage-union of the Achamoth with the Soter and of the pneumatic souls with the angels (Iren. i. 1‚Äì7; exc. ex Theod. 43‚Äì65). =Two-fold Sophia= The same form of doctrine meets us also in Secundus, who is said to have been the first to have made the distinction of an upper and a lower Sophia (Iren. i. 11, 2), and in the account which the Philosophumena give us of a system which most probably referred to the school of Heracleon, and which also speaks of a double Sophia (Philos. vi.). The name Jerusalem also for the ex≈ç Sophia meets us here (Philos. vi. 29). It finds its interpretation in the fragments of Heracleon (ap. Origen. in Joann. tom. x. 19). The name Achamoth, on the other hand, is wanting both in Hippolytus and in Heracleon. One school among the Marcosians seems also to have taught a two-fold Sophia (Iren. i. 16, 3; cf. 21, 5). =Etymology= August Hahn (1819) debated whether the name Acham≈çth (·ºàœáŒ±ŒºœéŒ∏) is originally derived from the Hebrew Chokhmah (◊ó÷∏◊õ÷∞◊û÷∏÷ë◊î), in Aramaic ·∏§achm≈´th or whether it signifies 'She that brings forth'‚Äî'Mother.' The Syriac form ·∏§achm≈´th is testified for us as used by Bardesanes (Ephraim, Hymn 55), the Greek form Hacham≈çth is found only among the Valentinians: the name however probably belongs to the oldest Syrian Gnosis. Bardesanes Cosmogonic myths play their part also in the doctrine of Bardesanes. The locus foedus whereon the gods (or Aeons) measured and founded Paradise (Ephraim, Hymn 55) is the same as the impure mƒìtra, which Ephraim is ashamed even to name (cf. also Ephraim, Hymn 14). The creation of the world is brought to pass through the son of the living one and the R≈´ha d' QudshƒÅ, the Holy Spirit, with whom ·∏§achm≈´th is identical, but in combination with \\"creatures,\\" i.e. subordinate beings which co-operate with them (Ephraim, Hymn 3). It is not expressly so said, and yet at the same time is the most probable assumption, that as was the case with the father and mother so also their offspring the son of the Living One, and the R≈´ha d' QudshƒÅ or ·∏§achm≈´th, are to be regarded as a Syzygy. This last (the ·∏§achm≈´th) brings forth the two daughters, the \\"Shame of the Dry Land\\" i.e. the mƒìtra, and the \\"Image of the Waters\\" i.e. the Aquatilis Corporis typus, which is mentioned in connection with the Ophitic Sophia (Ephraim, Hymn 55). Beside which, in a passage evidently referring to Bardesanes, air, fire, water, and darkness are mentioned as aeons (ƒ™thyƒì: Hymn 41) These are probably the \\"Creatures\\" to which in association with the Son and the R≈´ha d' QudshƒÅ, Bardesanes is said to have assigned the creation of the world. Though much still remains dark as to the doctrine of Bardesanes we cannot nevertheless have any right to set simply aside the statements of Ephraim, who remains the oldest Syrian source for our knowledge of the doctrine of this Syrian Gnostic, and deserves therefore our chief attentions. Bardesanes, according to Ephraim, is able also to tell of the wife or maiden who having sunk down from the Upper Paradise offers up prayers in her dereliction for help from above, and on being heard returns to the joys of the Upper Paradise (Ephraim, Hymn 55). Acts of Thomas These statements of Ephraim are further supplemented by the Acts of Thomas in which various hymns have been preserved which are either compositions of Bardesanes himself, or at any rate are productions of his school. =Hymn of the Pearl= In the Syriac text of the Acts, we find the Hymn of the Pearl, where the soul which has been sent down from her heavenly home to fetch the pearl guarded by the serpent, but has forgotten here below her heavenly mission until she is reminded of it by a letter from \\"the father, the mother, and the brother,\\" performs her task, receives back again her glorious dress, and returns to her old home. =Ode to the Sophia= Of the other hymns which are preserved in the Greek version more faithfully than in the Syriac text which has undergone Catholic revision, the first deserving of notice is the Ode to the Sophia which describes the marriage of the \\"maiden\\" with her heavenly bridegroom and her introduction into the Upper Realm of Light. This \\"maiden,\\" called \\"daughter of light,\\" is not as the Catholic reviser supposes the Church, but ·∏§achm≈´th (Sophia) over whose head the \\"king,\\" i.e. the father of the living ones, sits enthroned; her bridegroom is, according to the most probable interpretation, the son of the living one, i.e. Christ. With her the living Ones i.e. pneumatic souls enter into the Pleroma and receive the glorious light of the living Father and praise along with \\"the living spirit\\" the \\"father of truth\\" and the \\"mother of wisdom.\\" =First prayer of consecration= The Sophia is also invoked in the first prayer of consecration.Bonnet, pp. 20 sq. She is there called the \\"merciful mother,\\" the \\"consort of the masculine one,\\" \\"revealant of the perfect mysteries,\\" \\"Mother of the Seven Houses,\\" \\"who finds rest in the eighth house,\\" i.e. in the Ogdoad. In the second Prayer of ConsecrationBonnet, p. 36. she is also designated, the \\"perfect Mercy\\" and \\"Consort of the Masculine One,\\" but is also called \\"Holy Spirit\\" (Syriac R≈´ha d' QudshƒÅ) \\"Revealant of the Mysteries of the whole Magnitude,\\" \\"hidden Mother,\\" \\"She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect,\\" and \\"she who partakes in the conflicts of the noble Agonistes\\" (i.e. of Christ, cf. exc. ex Theod. 58 ho megas ag≈çnistƒìs Iƒìsous). There is further a direct reminiscence of the doctrine of Bardesanes when she is invoked as the Holy Dove which has given birth to the two twins, i.e. the two daughters of the R≈´ha d' QudshƒÅ (ap. Ephraim, Hymn 55). Pistis Sophia A special and richly coloured development is given to the mythical form of the Sophia of the Gnostic Book Pistis Sophia. The two first books of this writing to which the name Pistis Sophia properly belongs, treat for the greater part (pp. 42‚Äì181) of the fall, the Repentance, and the Redemption of the Sophia. =Fall= She has by the ordinance of higher powers obtained an insight into the dwelling-place appropriated to her in the spiritual world, namely, the thƒìsauros lucis which lies beyond the XIIIth Aeon. By her endeavours to direct thither her upward flight, she draws upon herself the enmity of the Authadƒìs, Archon of the XIIIth Aeon, and of the Archons of the XII Aeons under him; by these she is enticed down into the depths of chaos, and is there tormented in the greatest possible variety of ways, in order that she may thus incur the loss of her light-nature. =Repentance= In her utmost need she addresses thirteen penitent prayers (metanoiai) to the Upper Light. Step by step she is led upwards by Christus into the higher regions, though she still remains obnoxious to the assaults of the Archons, and is, after offering her XIIIth Metanoia, more vehemently attacked than ever, until at length Christus leads her down into an intermediate place below the XIIIth Aeon, where she remains until the consummation of the world, and sends up grateful hymns of praise and thanksgiving. =Redemption= The earthly work of redemption having been at length accomplished, the Sophia returns to her original celestial home. The peculiar feature in this representation consists in the further development of the philosophical ideas which find general expression in the Sophia mythos. According to Karl Reinhold von K√∂stlin (1854), Sophia is here not merely, as with Valentinus, the representative of the longing which the finite spirit feels for the knowledge of the infinite, but at the same time a type or pattern of faith, of repentance, and of hope. After her restoration she announces to her companions the twofold truth that, while every attempt to overstep the divinely ordained limits, has for its consequence suffering and punishment, so, on the other hand, the divine compassion is ever ready to vouchsafe pardon to the penitent. =Light- Maiden= We have a further reminiscence of the Sophia of the older Gnostic systems in what is said in the book Pistis Sophia of the Light-Maiden (parthenos lucis), who is there clearly distinguished from the Sophia herself, and appears as the archetype of Astraea, the Constellation Virgo.K√∂stlin, pp. 57 sq. The station which she holds is in the place of the midst, above the habitation assigned to the Sophia in the XIIIth Aeon. She is the judge of (departed) souls, either opening for them or closing against them the portals of the light-realm (pp. 194‚Äì295). Under her stand yet seven other light- maidens with similar functions, who impart to pious souls their final consecrations (pp. 291 sq. 327 sq. 334). From the place of the parthenos lucis comes the sun-dragon, which is daily borne along by four light-powers in the shape of white horses, and so makes his circuit round the earth (p. 183, cf. pp. 18, 309). Manichaeism This light-maiden (parthenos tou ph≈çtos) encounters us also among the Manichaeans as exciting the impure desires of the Daemons, and thereby setting free the light which has hitherto been held down by the power of darkness (Dispuiat. Archelai et Manetis, c. 8, n. 11; Theodoret., h. f. I. 26).Anathemat. Manich. ap. Cotelier on the Recogn. Clement IV., 27 et passim. On the other hand, the place of the Gnostic Sophia is among Manichaeans taken by the \\"Mother of Life\\" (mƒìtƒìr tƒìs z≈çƒìs), and by the World-Soul (psychƒì hapant≈çn), which on occasions is distinguished from the Life-Mother, and is regarded as diffused through all living creatures, whose deliverance from the realm of darkness constitutes the whole of the world's history (Titus of Bostra, adv. Manich. I., 29, 36, ed. Lagarde, p. 17 sqq. 23; Alexander Lycopolitus c. 3; Epiphan. Haer. 66, 24; Acta dispatat. Archelai et Manetis, c. 7 sq. et passim).Cf. Baur, pp. 51 sqq. 64, 209. Their return to the world of light is described in the famous Canticum Amatorium (ap. Augustin. c. Faust, iv. 5 sqq). Nag Hammadi texts In On the Origin of the World, Sophia is depicted as the ultimate destroyer of this material universe, Yaldabaoth and all his Heavens: Mythology Carl Jung linked the figure of Sophia to the highest archetype of the anima in depth psychology. The archetypal fall and recovery of Sophia is additionally linked (to a varying degree) to many different myths and stories (see damsel in distress). Among these are: *Isis, who while still in the cosmic womb, brings forth the flawed Elder Horus without a consortAs told by Plutarch, On the Worship of Isis and Osiris, LIV, 5‚Äì6. See . *The abduction and rescue of Helen of Troy *Persephone and her descent into Hades, from which she returns to life [but is bound to return to Hades for 6 months every year] *The fall of Eve and the birth of Christ through the Virgin Mary *The descent of Orpheus into the underworld to rescue his wife, Eurydice *The return of Odysseus to his kingdom, Ithaca, to reclaim his wife, Penelope *The rescue of Andromeda by Perseus *Ishtar's descent to the Underworld, in the Epic of Gilgamesh *Pandora * Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty *The slaying of the Dragon by St. George to rescue the Princess *The rescue of the kidnapped Sita by her husband, the god-king Rama, with the help of Hanuman in the Ramayana Note that many of these myths have alternative psychological interpretations. For example, Jungian psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz interpreted fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty as symbolizing the 'rescue' or reintegration of the anima, the more 'feminine' part of a man's unconscious, but not wisdom or sophia per se.

In 900, his powerful colleague Cui Yin falsely accused him of associating with eunuchs, and Emperor Zhaozong forced him to commit suicide.  Background  It is not known when Wang Tuan was born. He was born from a lineage that had two male-line ancestors who were chancellors earlier in history ‚Äî his 10th generation ancestor Wang Fangqing, who served under the female sovereign Wu Zetian, and his great-grandfather Wang Yu, who served under Emperor Suzong. Both his grandfather Wang Ji (ÁéãÂèä) and father Wang Hui (ÁéãÈê¨) also served honored positions in the imperial administration.New Book of Tang, vol. 72.  Early career  At some point, Wang Tuan passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class. He thereafter served on the staff of the former chancellor Wang DuoNew Book of Tang, vol. 116. (who was not related to him, as Wang Tuan was from the \\"Langye Branch\\" of Wangs while Wang Duo was from the \\"Taiyuan Branch\\" of Wangs) in Wang Duo's role as the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ÊªëÂ∑û, in modern Anyang, Henan).As the office of the prefect of Hua Prefecture would have been one carried by Wang Duo as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê), which had its capital at Hua Prefecture, and Wang Duo served as the military governor of Yicheng from 882 to 884, Wang Tuan's service under Wang Duo would have been during that period. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 164. Wang Tuan later served as the prefect of Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), and later the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) as well as director of taxation (Âà§Êà∂ÈÉ®, Pan Hubu).  As chancellor  In 895, when Emperor Zhaozong commissioned the chancellor Cui Yin to be the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to take back control of Huguo for the imperial government, he made Wang Tuan Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé) ‚Äî the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) ‚Äî and a chancellor with the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã) to replace Cui.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. While it was said that Wang was understanding and magnanimous, and that the people considered him an excellent chancellor, little is known about Wang's own actions as chancellor, other than that, when Emperor Zhaozong fled from the imperial capital Chang'an into the Qinling Mountains later in the year in fear of being taken hostage by the warlords Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Wang Tuan, along with other chancellors Cui Zhaowei and Xu Yanruo, accompanied the emperor. In 896, while Emperor Zhaozong was at Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) due to another attack by Li Maozhen on the capital, the warlord Qian Liu the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) defeated and killed fellow warlord Dong Chang the military governor of Weisheng Circuit (Â®ÅÂãù, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) (who had declared himself the emperor of a new state of Dayue Luoping (Â§ßË∂äÁæÖÂπ≥) but then disavowed the declaration), thus taking over control of Weisheng. Emperor Zhaozong, apparently in an attempt to take back control of Weisheng, commissioned Wang as the military governor of Weisheng, still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary title. However, Qian, not willing to cede control of Weisheng, encouraged the people of Zhenhai and Weisheng Circuits to submit petitions to have Qian be the military governor of both circuits. Emperor Zhaozong, bowing to the pressure, recalled Wang to serve as chancellor again, as well as the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu), while naming Qian the military governor of both circuits. After Emperor Zhaozong created his son Li Yu, Prince of De Crown Prince in 897,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Wang Tuan suggested that a general pardon be issued to show the importance of the creation. Emperor Zhaozong thereafter gave Wang the titles of You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), as well as Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies). He also created Wang the Duke of Lu.  Death  Meanwhile, by spring 900, Cui Yin had become the most powerful official at the imperial court. Cui had already previously intensely plotted with Emperor Zhaozong in considering whether to slaughter the eunuchs. Wang, fearing that such plotting would lead to an explosive confrontation between imperial officials and eunuchs, urged caution. Cui, who had earlier already accused Wang of working in concert with the eunuch directors of palace communications Zhu Daobi (Êú±ÈÅìÂºº) and Jing Wuxiu (ÊôØÂãôËÑ©), had previously suspected Wang Tuan of squeezing him out of the chancellorship in 899, and further despised Wang after he was, in spring 900, sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). Before he left the capital, he renewed the accusations against Wang. Subsequently, Cui's ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) submitted a petition urging that Cui be returned to the chancellorship and accusing Wang of collaborating with the eunuchs. Emperor Zhaozong recalled Cui to Chang'an to serve as chancellor again, while demoting Wang to be the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang). Within a few days, Wang was further demoted to be the prefect of Xi Prefecture (Ê∫™Â∑û, in modern Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan), then to be the census officer at Yai Prefecture (Â¥ñÂ∑û, in modern Haikou, Hainan). The same day that the exile to Yai Prefecture was announced, Wang was forced to commit suicide (as were Zhu Daobi and Jing), and Wang died at Lantian Station (ËóçÁî∞È©õ, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi).

Due to a problem with his voice box, Once took a hiatus from singing between 1993 and 1997. He used this time to study law at the University of Indonesia, graduating in 1996. He also worked for a construction company. By 1997 he had begun singing again, in cafes, and in 1998 he recorded the soundtrack for the film Kuldesak with Ahmad Dhani. Once was later asked to join Dhani's band, Dewa 19, in 2000, and eventually replaced Ari Lasso, who was expelled from the group for drug use. In the beginning, Once had difficulty fulfilling fan's high expectations set by Lasso, and was noted as not communicating with them as well as having a stiff on-stage persona. Once was eventually accepted by Dewa 19's fans after Bintang Lima, his first album with the group, was a hit; it eventually sold 1.7 million copies. He later recorded four more albums with Dewa 19. He also released three solo singles, \\"Dealova\\", \\"Aku Mau\\" (\\"I Want\\") and \\"Symphony yang Indah\\" (\\"A Beautiful Symphony\\"). On 19 January 2011, Once resigned from Dewa 19 to develop his solo career; it was rumored that problems with royalties were a factor in his decision. He eventually joined with Lasso, Doadibadai Hollo of Kerispatih, Maggi of /rif, Irfan of Samsons, and Yuke to form the AYLI (As You Like It) Project. In June 2011, he began recording his first solo album. Awards Once was voted Best Pop Soloist at the 2005 Anugerah Musik Indonesia (AMI). The following year, one of his songs was voted Best Pop Song at AMI. Personal life Once married Rietmadhanty Angelica Tauchid on 20 December 2005. Together they have one son.

History Tea rooms Compton Street, Adelaide 1912 Before entering politics he held various jobs as a stall keeper, marine store dealer and hotel keeper, eventually holding licences for the Brunswick Hotel, the Newmarket Hotel on North Terrace and the Hotel Victor at Victor Harbor.Suzanne Edgar, 'Edwards, Albert Augustine (1888‚Äì1963)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 5 March 2013 He took over the British Lion Hotel in Hindmarsh. In 1917 he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Adelaide. He was also a prominent elected member of the Adelaide City Council. In both State and Municipal politics he had a frequent antagonist in Mrs. A. K. Goode. Goode and Edwards were candidates for the seat of Adelaide in the House of Assembly elections in 1924. Edwards and fellow Labor Party candidates W. J. Denny and J. Dunn were successful; Goode came a distant fourth. Goode and Edwards were candidates for the Grey ward for the Adelaide City Council in 1924. Edwards topped the poll but had, as Mrs. Goode pointed out, contravened the Act by driving voters to the polling place. She refrained from formally charging him, as this could have given her the seat by default without a fair majority of votes. Both had interests in prison reform, and both served on the State Children's Council, but frequently and publicly disagreed on aims and objects. In 1925 Goode criticised as excessively lenient the jailing for one year of one Kelly, who was convicted of indecent assault. Edwards defended the judge, pointing out that the girl was a consenting party and above the age of consent. In 1927 Edwards criticised her for disallowing a proposed increase in allowances for \\"State girls\\" (wards of the State who were \\"boarded out\\" with generally well-to-do families or widows as companions and maids-of-all-work) from 2/ to 5/ (shillings) per week. Edwards served as a Member of the House of Assembly until 1931, when his seat was vacated by absence without leave. He had been convicted of \\"an unnatural offence\\" with John Gaunt \\"Jack\\" Mundy, 16, a \\"sexually perverted boy\\", and sentenced to five years' jail. His appeals failed but he was released in 1933. For his period of incarceration, he had his brother Arthur and sister-in-law Millicent Edwards manage his hotel, the Castle Inn at the corner of Hindley and Morphett Streets. In 1937 Millicent brought an action against Albert, charging him with assault and indecent language which he had used against her when she demanded money in consideration of the work she had put into his hotel. Her suit was unsuccessful and she was ordered to pay costs. In 1940 he stood unsuccessfully as an Independent for the Federal seat of Adelaide. In 1948 he won a seat on the Adelaide City Council for the seat of Grey. A charge of gross indecency brought against Edwards in 1942 was dropped when the two principal witnesses refused to testify. Philanthropy In 1961 he endowed a men's refuge in Whitmore Square; in 1963 he purchased the adjoining property as a rehabilitation centre for prisoners, named the Frank Lundie Hostel for his friend and colleague the secretary of the South Australian branch of the Australian Workers' Union. He contributed generously to a meal centre run by the Daughters of Charity in Hutt Street. Football \\"Bert\\" Edwards was a longtime follower of the West Adelaide Football Club, a member of the South Australian Football League. In 1921 West Adelaide nominated him as their delegate to the League's governing body, but was rejected on the grounds that he had once used intemperate language at a junior meeting. Edwards, who had no knowledge of the offence, refused to apologise, and a standoff ensued, which became so entrenched that at one stage consideration was given to disbanding the League and re-forming it without West Adelaide. Western Australia Edwards was a frequent, prominent and newsworthy visitor to Western Australia and in 1925 was appointed a Justice of the Peace for that State. When he successfully stood for the Grey ward in the Adelaide City Council, his election was touted by the Perth Sunday Times as attracting the \\"most interest\\". Death He died in 1963 without any heirs. His considerable assets were left to charities for the homeless and destitute.

He was a Labor Party member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1930 until 1933, representing the electorate of Sturt. He was the leader of the official Labor Party in South Australia in the aftermath of the 1931 Labor split from May 1932 until his defeat at the 1933 state election. Early life Dawes was born at Stepney, South Australia and was educated at Norwood School and Norwood High School. He apprenticed as an engineer at A. W. Dobbie & Co. Ltd., and later worked as a fitter and turner at the Islington Railway Workshops. He was the secretary of the South Australian branch of the Australian Society of Engineers from 1927 to 1941, president of the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia in 1930‚Äì1931, and state president of the Labor Party. Parliamentary career and Labor leadership Dawes was elected to the House of Assembly in the Labor victory at the 1930 election, defeating a Liberal Federation MP in the multi- member Sturt electorate. He remained loyal to official Labor in the 1931 Labor split, and as state president of the Labor Party, wound up being a spokesperson for the party during the split. In May 1932, when the remaining six-member Labor caucus decided to elect a parliamentary leader, they selected Dawes. Dawes elected to recontest Sturt at the April 1933 election even though it was a close marginal seat, and in the aftermath of the split lost to a Liberal Federation candidate. After state politics Dawes was an unsuccessful candidate for the Australian Senate at the 1937 election and for the electorate of Adelaide at the 1940 federal election. In 1940, one newspaper described him as \\"one of the best known men in the Labor movement...and the strongest man in the party\\". Post-politics, he worked for the state Department of Munitions from 1940 to 1945 and was vice-chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1944 to 1967. He was also a board member of the Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1933 to 1972, a council member of the Australian National University from 1951 to 1955, chair of the executive committee of the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and member of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital board and the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science council.

They can be found in the Eastern temperate forest region of the eastern United States, southern Canada, and the eastern Great Plains. Because of their great adaptability, they can live in country, suburbs, and even urban cities. This adaptability makes them a great pollinator species, leading to an increase in their commercial use by greenhouse industry. This increase consequently led to their farther spread outside their previous distribution range. They are considered one of the most important species of pollinator bees in North America.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  The generic epithet (the first part of the name) Bombus comes from the genus Bombus, which is also commonly known as bumblebee and belongs to the tribe Bombini. The specific name (the latter half of its scientific name) may come from the flowers of the genus Impatiens, which is one of its food sources. An alternative explanation is that these bees are easily provoked into stinging, and so are \\"impatient.\\" Including B. impatiens, the genus Bombus contains 250 species and most species are characterized by their eusociality or parasitic nature. Specifically, the genus Bombus has 49 subgenera, and B. impatiens belongs to the subgenus Pyrobombus. B. impatiens is also of the order Hymenoptera and family Apidae which characterizes its kin selection and relatedness.  Description and Identification  = Queens, workers, and males = The bees of B. impatiens are similar to those of B. bimaculatus, B. perplexus, B. vagans, B. sandersoni, and B. separatus in their appearance. They have short and even hair, medium-sized heads with cheeks that are similar in width to their heads, and a long and rectangular body. In general, queens and workers are similar in their coloring, pubescence, and structure. However, with a body length of 17‚Äì23 mm, queens have bigger bodies than males or workers. Workers have bodies that are 8.5‚Äì16 mm, and males have bodies that are 12‚Äì18 mm long. The differences in their sizes can be observed by the differences in their larval weight at second instar. In addition to the difference in their sizes, males slightly differ in their coloring. While queens and workers are both black with a yellow thorax and first abdominal segment, males have a yellow face and head.  Nests  B. impatiens have underground nests that are 1‚Äì3 feet below the ground surface. They enter their nests using tunnels that are 18 inches to 9 feet long. Unlike the nests of honeybees or paper wasps, the nests of B. impatiens do not have a predictable pattern. The bees lay egg clumps all over inside the nest instead of having one brood area around which the workers‚Äô distribution center is arranged. Within the nest there is a special division of labor and social organization. 11‚Äì13% of workers maintain small spatial fidelity zones inside the nest, and all workers remain at a specific distance from the colony center. Smaller individuals maintained smaller spatial zones and tended to be closer to the center of the nest. Individuals that perform the in-nest task of larval feeding were found in the center of the nest, while foragers were often found on the periphery of the nest when not foraging.  Distribution and habitat  Broadly, they can be found in the Eastern temperate forest region of the eastern United States, southern Canada, and the eastern Great Plains. More specifically, its range includes Ontario, the New England States, Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, south to Florida, west to Michigan, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa. Also, the increase in their commercial use by greenhouse industry led to the spread of the species outside its previous distribution range. Bombus impatiens adapts well to a variety of habitats, nectar sources, and climates and was seen visiting a variety and abundance of plants. In addition to agricultural, wetland, and urban conditions, the species can thrive in wooded habitats, and is likely related to woodland spring ephemerals. It nests underground in open fields and woods.  Colony  To start colonies, the gynes usually leave their hibernacula starting in mid-April and establish colonies in May. In the beginning of June, the workers start to emerge and in August and September the male bees and young queens start appearing. However, at times, the bees can emerge around late to mid-October. In terms of colony sizes, a colony of B. impatiens consists of more than 450 individual bees and most are worker bees.  Behavior  = Division of labor = Inside the nest, the worker bees distribute themselves in a nonrandom fashion to be a certain distance away from the center of the nest. By doing so they increase their efficiency, as the distance traveled between tasks is minimized. The tasks of some workers are related to their space in the nest. The labor for the workers is divided according to their body sizes. They vary in size, and the smaller bees are usually found near the center of the nest with the job of feeding the larvae whereas the bigger workers are usually found at the periphery, working as foragers and as guards. In general, they keep their spatial pattern as well as their jobs throughout their lifetime. = Reproductive suppression = Worker bees are totipotent and have the ability to lay eggs, and a few workers even have mature oocytes in their ovaries. However, when there is a queen in the colony, the workers do not attempt to lay eggs or develop eggs. They usually do not show aggression towards other workers or the queen, showing no ‚Äúcompetition phase.‚Äù Without a queen, aggression is more common. = Mating = Queen and drone mating A gyne mates with a male bee near the end of the hives life cycle. They rest on the ground or on vegetation in order to mate and the mating lasts from 10 to 80 minutes. In order to increase the probability of his genes getting passed down safely, the male mates for a certain amount of time to let his sperm harden during mating. Soon thereafter the gynes hibernate. The following spring they emerge from hibernation and set about to get strong on nectar and to find a suitable old mouse or chipmunk hole to begin a colony. The first thing she builds is a honeypot, then she fills it with food (nectar/pollen), making it easier to feed her new brood, which are raised in paper cells she builds. The queens lay about 2000 eggs in one season, but only half of them will survive to become full adults.  Foraging  = Traplining = Foragers of B. impatiens colonies use a strategy called traplining, in which the bees visit their food sources in a repeatable sequence, to improve their efficiency, especially in an unfamiliar environment. The bees establish traplines by searching among flowers in an orderly manner. Upon establishment, the traplines remain stable for long periods of time.Thomson JD (1996) Trapline foraging by bumblebees. I. Persistence of Xight-path geometry. Behav Ecol 7:158‚Äì164 Traplining has many advantages. The bees can minimize both the distance traveled by linking the sources in a more direct path and the time spent searching by knowing the locations of food sources. Also, the bees can travel through the locations that were recently depleted of their resources, saving their energy and time. = Communication = B. impatiens use communication in order to maximize the benefit of foraging. The bees become faster and more accurate as they become more experienced at foraging, and the returning foragers tend to stimulate the foraging activity of the colony.Anna Dornhaus, Lars Chittka. Information flow and regulation of foraging activity in bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Apidologie, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2004, 35 (2), pp.183-192. <10.1051/apido:2004002>. The foragers of B. impatiens improve their foraging activity by communicating with others in their nests. They share their abilities to associate scents of good food sources.  Interaction with other species  = Diet = There are many food plants for B. impatiens including: ‚ÄúAster‚Äù, Cirsium, Eupatorium, Gelsemium, Malus, Pontederia, Rubus, Solidago, Trifolium, Crocus, Pieris, Rhododendron, barberry, mountain laurel, rose, clover, purple vetch, pickerel weed, purple loosestrife, buttonbush, jewel-weed, Beggar‚Äôs ticks, goldenrod, boneset, burdock, and Impatiens from which the bee's name may come. The bees can eat the raw materials like pollen and nectar of the flowers but most bees in the colony eat honey that is made using the raw materials since it has higher nutritional value. To create honey, the bees consume the pollen and the nectar, and then regurgitate them, mixing them with enzymes in their stomachs. The bees store the honey for winter since during winter months, there will be no flowers from which they can forage raw materials. = Parasites = Bombus impatiens are hosts to other bees. Ps. Laborious and Bombus citrinus are some examples of parasites. Also, Entromopox-like viruses and prokaryotes called Spiroplasmataceae have been found in the workers. However, there is no known harmful effect to B. impatiens.'''  Importance to humans  Bees play in a significant role in pollinating crops. A decline in bee population leads to a decline in crop yield, which will then result in a reduction in the food supply and cause economic hardships for farmers. Commercially produced B. impatiens is one of the most important species of pollinator bees that are used by greenhouse industry in North America, including Canada and Mexico.Hayo H.W. Velthuis, Adriaan Van Doorn. A century of advances in bumblebee domestication and the economic and environmental aspects of its commercialization for pollination. Apidologie, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2006, 37 (4), pp.421-451. They are efficient pollinators and natives to East North America. The interest in B. impatiens has been increased even more due to the decline of pollinator bee population like A. mellifera and the ban on importing B. terrestris into North America. They are used as pollinator bees for tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, and pumpkins.

When Dell pleads with Vic to go easy on her brother, he reveals that he is interested in her, having just broken off an affair with her married sister Corinne. Later, Bob finds a vanity case with the Hamilton family seal under a pillow in Vic's bedroom. He assumes it belongs to Dell (rather than Corinne). When he accuses Dell, she pretends it is true in order to protect her sister. Furious and drunk, Bob goes back to Vic's place. Dell chases after him, but is too late. Bob shoots and kills Vic in the elevator. The siblings quickly leave the scene. Unaware that Bob is the killer, District Attorney Mills agrees to keep the Hamilton name out of the scandal, but public opinion and newspaper reporter Segall will not let the case be forgotten. Blaming Dave for the uproar, Mills forces the lawyer to take over the case as a newly appointed deputy district attorney by threatening to ruin his career. Dell, however, believes he took the job to further his ambitions. By bad luck, the doorman recognizes Dell when she leaves Dave's office, and she is put on trial. When she is called to the witness stand, however, Dave cannot bring himself to cross examine her too closely and accepts her unconvincing story. However, the doorman catches her in a lie, and the truth mostly comes out (except for Corinne's part in it). Bob is acquitted for defending his sister's honor, and Dell and Dave get back together.

Muromachi period, 15th century, Tokyo National Museum, Important Cultural Property Gusoku Type Armor With do-maru cuirass and white lacing, Edo period, 17th century , Tokyo National Museum The predecessor of the samurai cuirass, or d≈ç, was manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.Sacred texts and buried treasures: issues in the historical archaeology of ancient Japan, William Wayne Farris, University of Hawaii Press, 1998 P.75tank≈ç, worn by foot soldiers and keik≈ç, worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected by leather thongs. During the Heian period (794 to 1185) the Japanese cuirass evolved into the more familiar style of armour worn by the samurai known as the d≈ç. Japanese armour makers started to use hardened leather along with iron in their armour construction and lacquer was used to weather proof the armor parts. By the end of the Heian period the Japanese cuirass had arrived at the shape recognized as being distinctly samurai. Leather and or iron scales were used to construct samurai armours, with leather and eventually silk lace used to connect the individual scales (kozane) which these cuirasses were now being made from.Oriental Armour, H. Russell Robinson, Courier Dover Publications, 2002 P.i73 In the 16th century Japan began trading with Europe during what would become known as the Nanban trade. Samurai acquired European cuirasses which they modified and combined with domestic armour as it provided better protection from the newly introduced matchlock muskets known as Tanegashima. The introduction of the tanegashima by the Portuguese in 1543Tanegashima: the arrival of Europe in Japan, Olof G. Lidin, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies, NIAS Press, 2002 along with a change in battle tactics caused the Japanese armour makers to change the design of the d≈ç from the centuries-old lamellar armours to plate armour constructed from iron and steel plates, this type of armour was called tosei gusoku (new armours).Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 P.32 Bullet resistant d≈ç were developed, this type of armour was called tameshi gusoku (bullet tested)The Watanabe Art Museum Samurai Armour CollectionVolume I ~ Kabuto & Mengu, Trevor Absolon P.78 allowing samurai to continue wearing their armour despite the increasing use of firearms.

By this time samurai continued to use both plate and lamellar cuirasses as a symbol of their status, but traditional armours were no longer necessary. During the Edo period, lightweight and concealed armour became popular as there was still a need for personal protection. Civil strife, duels, assassinations, and peasant revolts required the use of tatami d≈ç as well as kusari katabira (chain armour jackets) and armoured sleeves as well as other types of armour which could be worn under ordinary clothing.Secrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan, Oscar Ratti, Adele Westbrook, Tuttle Publishing, 1991 P.196 Edo period samurai were in charge of internal security and would wear various types of kusari gusoku (chain armour) and shin and arm protection as well as forehead protectors (hachi-gane).Taiho-jutsu: law and order in the age of the samurai, Don Cunningham, Tuttle Publishing, 2004 P.46 Traditional armor continued to be worn and used in Japan until the end of the samurai era (Meiji period) in the 1860s, with the last use of samurai armour happening in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion.Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 P.58 Types of d≈ç The type of d≈ç that originally came with a matched suit of armour defined the name for that particular suit of armour, for example, a suit of armour that came with a hotoke d≈ç would be called a hotoke d≈ç gusoku; a suit of armour that came with a karuta tatami d≈ç would be called a karuta tatami d≈ç gusoku. =Kozane d≈ç= True kozane d≈ç are of lamellar construction using individual scales known as kozane, they were used before the introduction of firearms in Japanese warfare.Japan's ancient armour, Hatiro Yamagami, Japan.

The Jackjumper is a skiing device with a bench seat attached to a ski. The seat may be solidly mounted with a post, or sprung mounted with a shock-absorbing device. The origins of Jack Jumping, as well as its name, remain a mystery. The earliest Jackjumpers date to the mid- to late 1800s. Early patents for Jackjumpers were granted in the 1920s and the 1930s. Jackjumpers in the US, and Skibocks in Europe, are used today for both sport and recreation. There are numerous competitive events scheduled each year on both continents.jack- jump world championships History The earliest Jackjumpers were made in New England in the mid- to late 1800s. While many early Jackjumpers were homemade, Jackjumpers that were manufactured in the late 1800s can be found in museums and private collections. The oldest patent issued for a Jackjumper goes back to 1914. The first European patent was registered in 1929 in the Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (Switzerland). There are many legends as to the origins of Jack Jumping. Some claim the earliest ones were made from barrel staves for skis and handcrafted wooden posts and seats. These Jackjumpers are said to be used by loggers. Others say is originated as a toy for children to enjoy in the winter. Whatever the case of origin, both adults and children alike have enjoyed Jackjumpers for over a century.

Set primarily in the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta, it also describes a partly fictionalized version of the events leading up to the coup attempt by the Communist Party of Indonesia on September 30, 1965. The novel's title refers to the Italian phrase vivere pericolosamente. It is roughly translated into English as \\"living dangerously\\". Indonesian President Sukarno used the phrase for the title of his National Day speech of 17 August 1964.Vernay, p. 71. Plot introduction The novel is narrated by \\"Cookie\\", a news agency reporter. Cookie is an older man who acted as a father confessor to many of the characters in the novel, and is telling the story several years after it happened. He is a stand-in for author Christopher Koch,Vernay, p. 88-90. and helps to illuminate the ways in which identity is mediated by other people's perceptions of an individual and by that individual's perception of him or her self.McGregor, p. 163. Thematically, the novel explores the ways in which Australians began to conceptualize themselves differently from Europeans in the post-World War II era,Vernay, p. 60-61. and the way Eastern religions such as Shintoism and Buddhism offer new ways to approach old problems.Ousby and Abbott, p. 521. Billy the dwarf's telling of the Indonesian wayang shadow puppet play of the Buddhist legend of Prince Arjun and Princess Skrikandi illustrates the Hindu belief that there is no right or wrong and there are no final answers‚Äîone of the ideas raised by Eastern religions.Goldsmith and Lealand, p. 50-51. Plot The novel opens as Guy Hamilton, a foreign correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Service, arrives in Jakarta on assignment. He meets several members of the close-knit community of British and Australians in the city, which includes journalists and diplomatic personnel. Among them is Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian dwarf of high intelligence and moral seriousness who is a photojournalist. Hamilton's predecessor departed Indonesia before Guy arrived, and did not introduce Hamilton to any of his news contacts. Hamilton receives only limited support from the other foreign journalists in Jakarta, who compete for information from the Sukarno government, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Believing Hamilton to be a moral person, Billy (who is exceptionally well-connected) helps him obtain interviews. Hamilton's reputation as a journalist soars. Billy keeps photographs and notes about the people he knows, recording his observations of their character and their lives and making up stories about their possible motivations. Hamilton is alarmed to discover that Billy is keeping a file on him, too, but decides to trust Billy anyway. Hamilton and others frequently confide in the narrator, Cookie, who intersperses the story with details from Billy's files, such as that Billy is supporting a local woman, known only as Ibu, and her children living in Jakarta's slums with food and money. Billy introduces Hamilton to Jill Bryant, a beautiful young diplomat at the British embassy. Billy and Jill are close friends, even to the extent that Billy poses as her boyfriend so she can avoid unwanted attention, and Billy subtly manipulates events so that Hamilton and Jill continue to encounter one another. Hamilton quickly falls in love with Jill, and their relationship starts soon after a trip to the port of Priok. Hamilton also learns that Billy is a strong supporter of the Sukarno regime but is very concerned with the extreme poverty afflicting Indonesia. Jill's diplomatic work is a cover for her real job as an intelligence officer at the British embassy. She discovers that the People's Republic of China is apparently sending a shipment of weapons to Indonesia to arm the PKI. Jill tells Hamilton this in confidence, to explain the reason for her spending time with Colonel Henderson, a British diplomat and her former lover. But Hamilton, now focused almost completely on his career, decides to verify the story and scoop the other journalists. His assistant Kumar, a PKI member, suggests they holiday in a Dutch colonial villa in the mountains, but brings along Vera, a suspected KGB officer. Hamilton visits central Java to cover a PKI protest known as a Long March. His car is surrounded by a hostile crowd of PKI sympathizers. Although he escapes without harm, he is shaken by the close experience with death. On his journey back to Java he attends a village wayang show, a recurring plot element. At the village he encounters Vera, who later seemingly drugs him at a hotel in Bandung. Billy discovers this, and informs Jill who has become pregnant, causing her to end her relationship with Hamilton, and Billy to reject him as well. Billy is ostracised by the other journalists after Wally, a respected correspondent, is forced to leave the country, with reasons given about his opposition to the regime and unspecified immoralities. Cookie knows about Wally's homosexuality, the rumour uncovered by officials. Billy had made a cutting comment earlier in the week about Wally's homosexuality, and some journalists suspect he revealed this to the r√©gime, although Cookie doubts this. Increasingly sensitive to the poverty of the average Indonesian, Billy is outraged when the child he has been supporting dies of malnutrition and disease. Deciding that Sukarno has betrayed the revolution which put him in power, Billy toys with the idea of assassinating Sukarno. When Sukarno is due to arrive at the Hotel Indonesia, where foreign journalists stay, an altercation occurs where Billy seemingly falls to his death. According to the secret police he had a pistol, and jumped from the window after unfurling a banner reading 'Sukarno Feed Your People'. Hamilton and Cookie doubt this, but prefer to not let Billy be tarnished as an assassin. Cookie rushes to Billy's bungalow in order to retrieve his files, which allow for the story to be told. The PKI attempts a coup d'etat on 30 September 1965. Hamilton and Kumar drive to the Presidential Palace, where Hamilton attempts to gain entry by boldly walking past the guards. An Army officer strikes Hamilton in the face with his rifle butt. Badly injured, Henderson rescues Hamilton and takes him to British Embassy property. A physician tells Hamilton that he has a suspected detached retina, and must lie still for a month or risk losing sight in his eye.

Reception Although not even on the short list for the Miles Franklin Award (Australia's top literary prize),Vernay, p. 59. the novel won the Age Book of the Year Award in 1978 and the National Book Council Award for Australian Literature in 1979. The novel turned Koch into a household name in Australia, and cemented his reputation as one of the nation's top novelists. As of 1995, The Year of Living Dangerously was considered Koch's finest work.Ousby and Abbott, p. 520. The novel was not widely reviewed in the U.S. at the time of its publication. In one of the few reviews, Kirkus Reviews was less than laudatory, concluding that the political story required too much historical knowledge on the reader's part and dominated the story at the expense of the characters.\\"The Year of Living Dangerously.\\" Kirkus Reviews. 7 February 1978. The book was banned in Indonesia during the Suharto regime.Duiker and Spielvogel, p. 763. The ban was lifted after the post-Suharto reform era began in 1998. Film adaptation The novel was made into a 1982 film, The Year of Living Dangerously. The film was directed by Peter Weir and written by Koch, Weir, and David Williamson. Actress Linda Hunt won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Billy Kwan. While the novel focuses on the political atmosphere in Indonesia in 1965 and the moral choices faced by the characters, the film focuses primarily on the love affair between Guy and Jill.Goldsmith and Lealand, p. 50.

It was manifested in the 1860s, when the Chinese were employed in the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad, culminating in the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned further Chinese immigration as well as naturalization. Its origins can be traced to the American merchants, missionaries, and diplomats who sent home from China \\"relentlessly negative\\" reports of the people they encountered there. These attitudes were transmitted to Americans who never left North America, triggering talk of the Yellow Peril, and continued through the Cold War during McCarthyism. Some modern anti-Chinese sentiment may be the result of China's rise as a major world power seen to be at the expense of other countries. Columbia in an 1871 Thomas Nast cartoon, shown protecting a defenseless Chinese man from an angry Irish lynch mob that has just burned down an orphanage. The billboard behind is full of inflammatory anti-Chinese broadsheets. Early Chinese immigration to the United States Starting with the California Gold Rush in the middle 19th century, the United States‚Äîparticularly the West Coast states‚Äîenlisted large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The decline of the Qing Dynasty in China, instability and poverty caused many Chinese, especially from the province of Guangdong, to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as \\"reliable\\" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions. Chinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, and Chinese \\"coolies\\" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders.See, e.g., http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5046/%7C Cases of physical assaults on Chinese include the Chinese massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles and more recently the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit. The 1909 murder of Elsie Sigel in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. \\"The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to \\"innocent\\" and \\"virtuous\\" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States.\\" The emerging American trade unions, under such leaders as Samuel Gompers, also took an outspoken anti-Chinese position, regarding Chinese laborers as competitors to white laborers. Only with the emergence of the international trade union Industrial Workers of the World did trade unionists start to accept Chinese workers as part of the American working- class. During this period, the phrase \\"yellow peril\\" was popularized in the U.S. by newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst. It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, G. G. Rupert, who published The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident in 1911. Based on the phrase \\"the kings from the East\\" in the Christian scriptural verse Revelation 16:12, Rupert made the claim that China, India, Japan and Korea were attacking the West, but that Jesus Christ would stop them. In his 1982 book The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850-1940, William F. Wu states that \\"Pulp magazines in the 30s had a lot of yellow peril characters loosely based on Fu Manchu... Most were of Chinese descent, but because of the geopolitics at the time, a growing number of people were seeing Japan as a threat, too.\\" =Chinese Exclusion Act and legal discrimination= This map was published in 1885 as part of an official report of a Special Committee established by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors \\"on the Condition of the Chinese Quarter\\". In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. A notable example is that after San Francisco segregated its Chinese school children from 1859 until 1870, the law was amended in 1870 to drop the requirement to educate Chinese children entirely. This led to Tape v. Hurley, 66 Cal. 473 (1885), a landmark court case in the California Supreme Court in which the Court found the exclusion of a Chinese American student, Mamie Tape, from public school based on her ancestry unlawful. However, state legislation passed at the urging of San Francisco Superintendent of Schools Andrew J. Moulder after the school board lost its case enabled the establishment of a segregated school. The 1879 Constitution of the State of California prohibited employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, and by businesses incorporated in California. Also, it delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.Article XIX of the Constitution of the State of California of 1879 James Whitman, \\"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\\" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017), p. 35 In 1880, the elected officials of the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors. The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese people. Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, only one permit was granted of the two hundred applications from any Chinese owner, while virtually all non-Chinese applicants were granted a permit.only one out of approximately eighty non- Chinese applicants was denied a permit However, this led to the 1886 Supreme Court case Yick Wo v. Hopkins, that was the first case where the Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.. Discriminatory laws, in particular the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed by the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. Another key piece of legislation was the Naturalization Act of 1870, which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed alien land laws that prohibited non- citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \\"unassimilable\\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), then- Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote of the Chinese as: \\"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\\" In the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged \\"Yellow Peril\\" led to the implementation of the Page Act of 1875, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, expanded ten years later by the Geary Act. The Immigration Act of 1917 then created an \\"Asian Barred Zone\\" under nativist influence. The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \\"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race. The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove. The 1921 Emergency Quota Act, and then the Immigration Act of 1924, restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the census of 1910, xenophobic fears in the WASP community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia. One of the goal of this National Origins Formula, established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of ethnicity, by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \\"national character\\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in immigration laws. This system was repealed with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. =Chinese labor and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882= According to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US. California Governor John McDougal in 1851 praised the Chinese as \\"the most valuable immigrants\\" to California. In order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the Burlingame Treaty in 1868. Alternate URL The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 and 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880. 1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator John Miller spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support. The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions). President Chester A. Arthur vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the Angell Treaty, which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Direct URLs: Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Amendments introduced during the debate over the bill prohibited the naturalization of Chinese immigrants. After the initial ten-year ban in the Chinese Exclusion Act ended, Chinese exclusion was extended in 1892 by the Geary Act and then made permanent in 1902. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 shifted Americans' fears of the Yellow Peril from China to Japan. Cold War Anti-Chinese sentiment during the Cold War was largely the result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism, which coincided with increased popular fear of communist espionage because of the Chinese Civil War and China's involvement in the Korean War. During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned by the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand of them lost their jobs. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, had a real past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party. However, for the vast majority, their potential to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliations were both tenuous. Among these victims were Chinese Americans, who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party of China. =Deportation of Qian Xuesen= The most notable example is that of the top Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950. The Federal Bureau of Investigation located an American Communist Party document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without his clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks, he announced plans to return to mainland China, which had come under the government of Communist leader Mao Zedong. The Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, Dan A. Kimball, tried to keep Qian in the US: > It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist > than I was, and we forced him to go.Perrett, B. (January 7, 2008), Sea > Change, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168, No. 1, p.57-61. Qian would spend the next five years under house arrest, which included constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any research (classified) duties. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian. In 1955, the United States deported him to China in exchange for five American pilots captured during the Korean War. Later, he became the father of the modern Chinese space program. 21st century Modern anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States may originate from American fears of China's role as a rising power. Perceptions of China's rise have been so widespread that 'rise of China' has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the Global Language Monitor, as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in Social Media. In the United States 2010 elections, a significant number of negative advertisements from both major political parties focused on a candidates' alleged support for free trade with China. Some of the stock images that accompanied ominous voiceovers about China were actually of Chinatown, San Francisco. In particular, an advertisement called \\"Chinese Professor\\", which portrays a 2030 conquest of the West by China, used local Asian American extras to play Chinese, but the actors were not informed of the nature of the shoot. Columnist Jeff Yang said that in the campaign there was a \\"blurry line between Chinese and Chinese-Americans.\\" Larry McCarthy, the producer of \\"Chinese Professor,\\" defended his work by saying that \\"this ad is about America, it's not about China.\\" Other editorials commenting on the video have called the video not anti-Chinese. = Chinese exclusion policy of NASA = Due to security concerns, as part of the Chinese exclusion policy of NASA, many American space researchers were prohibited from working with Chinese citizens affiliated with a Chinese state enterprise or entity. In April 2011, the 112th United States Congress banned NASA from using its funds to host Chinese visitors at NASA facilities because of espionage concerns. Earlier in 2010, US Representative John Culberson, had urged President Barack Obama not to allow further contact between NASA and the China National Space Administration (CNSA). = Donald Trump 2016 campaign = In November 2015, Donald Trump promised to designate China as a currency manipulator on his first day in office.Doug Palmer & Ben Schreckinger, Trump's trade views vows to declare China a currency manipulator on Day One , Politico (November 10, 2015). He pledged \\"swift, robust and unequivocal\\" action against Chinese piracy, counterfeit American goods, and the theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property. He also condemned China's \\"illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards.\\" In January 2016, Trump proposed a 45% tariff on Chinese exports to the United States to give \\"American workers a level playing field.\\"Maggie Haberman, Donald Trump Says He Favors Big Tariffs on Chinese Exports , The New York Times (January 7, 2016).Binyamin Appelaum, On Trade, Donald Trump Breaks With 200 Years of Economic Orthodoxy , The New York Times (March 10, 2016). When asked about potential Chinese retaliation to the implementation of tariffs, such as sales of US bonds, Trump judged such a scenario to be unlikely: \\"They won't crash our currency. They will crash their economy. That's what they are going to do if they start playing that.\\" In a May 2016 speech, Trump responded to concerns regarding a potential trade war with China: \\"We're losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?\\" Trump also said in May 2016 that China is \\"raping\\" the U.S. with free trade. = Donald Trump presidency = Since 2018, Trump began to increase visa restrictions on Chinese nationality students and scholars, while many Chinese students and scholars said that they experienced delays in renewing their visas or even outright cancellations of their visas. In 2018, Presidential Advisor Stephen Miller proposed banning all Chinese nationality students. According to a Gallup poll released in February 2019, China was named as the America's greatest enemy by 21% percent of respondents in US, second only to Russia. In April 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that China posed a \\"whole of a society threat\\". In May 2019, Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner said that China \\"is the first great power competitor of the US that is not caucasian.\\" The current deterioration of relations has led to a spike in anti-Chinese sentiment in the US. According to a Pew Research Center poll released in August 2019, 60 percent of Americans have negative opinions about China, with only 26 percent holding positive views. The same poll found that China was named as America's greatest enemy by 24 percent of respondents in US, tied along with Russia. In March 2020, Trump referred to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States as the \\"Chinese Virus\\". In February 2020, the World Health Organization advised the public to not refer to coronavirus as the \\"Chinese virus\\" or \\"Wuhan virus\\". Additionally, the terms Wuflu and Kung Flu emerged in the United States during this period as alternative ways of referring to COVID-19. These terms are linked to Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via portmanteau with terms from traditional Chinese Martial Arts, Wushu and Kung Fu, and have been used by President Trump and members of his administration in an official capacity. Use of these terms has drawn widespread criticism for their perceived racial insensitivity. In May 2020, a West Virginia born Chinese-American CBS reporter questioned Trump at a White House coronavirus briefing about his stance on testing and he told her to question China. The reporter responded to Trump asking why he singled her out to question China which led to an abrupt ending of the briefing. On July 23, 2020, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the end of what he called \\"blind engagement\\" with the Chinese government. He also criticized Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as \\"a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology.\\"  See also  *Anti-American sentiment in China *China‚ÄìUnited States trade war *Red Chinese Battle Plan *List of incidents of xenophobia and racism related to the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic References Further reading * Lon Kurashige. 2016.

He was colonel of the 48th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment at the battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh. Early life Haynie was born in Dover, Tennessee, later to become site of the battle of Fort Donelson, which Haynie would take part in. At a young age he moved to Illinois where he worked as a farmer before volunteering for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was appointed first lieutenant of Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He was mustered out of volunteer services in 1848. Following the Mexican War, Haynie graduated from Kentucky Law School in 1852.Eicher p.600 Returning to Illinois, he served as a lawyer and Illinois Legislator. In 1860 Haynie was a presidential elector who voted for Stephen A. Douglas.Cooling p.145 Civil war On November 10, 1861, Haynie was appointed colonel of the 48th Illinois Infantry. Haynie's regiment was attached to the District of Cairo.48th Illinois When Ulysses S. Grant organized his expedition to Fort Henry, Haynie became part of William H. L. Wallace's brigade in John A. McClernand's division. He participated in the capture of Fort Henry. =Fort Donelson= A week later Haynie was involved in the investment of Fort Donelson. On February 13, a Confederate battery had been plaguing the Union position. McClernand order an assault on the battery despite orders not to bring on a general engagement. McClernand chose his 3rd Brigade under Colonel William R. Morrison to lead the attack. Morrison's brigade consisted of only two regiments and McClernand decided to temporarily attach Haynie's 48th Illinois to Morrison's brigade. As final preparations were made, Haynie realized he was now the ranking officer in the brigade. Morrison willingly consented stating it was no time to argue about rank. To that Haynie replied \\"Colonel, lets take it together.\\"Gott p.162 The two colonels led the men forward. Morrison was struck in the hip, taking him off the field and removing any command ambiguity between him and Haynie. The attack failed and the survivors returned to their lines. Colonel Leonard F. Ross was appointed the new permanent commander of Morrison's brigade and Haynie returned with his regiment to Wallace's brigade. McClernand and Grant were both eager to forget about the incident, but years later McClernand claimed to Haynie's son he wanted Haynie to lead the charge because he felt him an \\"abler soldier\\".Cooling p.145 =Shiloh= Following the reorganization of the Union Army following the Battle of Fort Donelson Haynie remained in command of his regiment but the brigade was now commanded by Colonel C. Carroll Marsh as W.H.L. Wallace was promoted to division command. During the fighting on April 6 around Shiloh Church, Haynie was struck in the left thigh and forced to turn over command of the regiment. =Later service= On November 29, 1862 Haynie was appointed Brigadier General of U.S. Volunteers pending the confirmation of the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, having recovered from his Shiloh wound, he was appointed to command of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XVII Corps. On March 4, 1863 his commission as Brigadier General expired having never been confirmed by the Senate. Haynie resigned from the army two days later on March 6.Eicher p.600 Returning to Illinois he served as adjutant general of the Illinois State Militia.

The land, which had been owned by the Good Shepherd Sisters since 1886, now incorporates the Mount Magdala Institute and the St John of God Chapel, which has a Category I heritage listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand). The first residents moved into the suburb in 2002. The developer caused controversy in 2007‚Äì2008 by applying to have a group of farm buildings demolished to allow for further subdivision. Christchurch City Council was widely criticised for approving the demolition despite the buildings having had a heritage listing in the Christchurch City Plan. Geography Aidanfield is located between Halswell Road (State Highway 75), Dunbars Road, the Christchurch Southern Motorway, the Canterbury Agricultural Park (home of the Canterbury A&P; Show) and Templetons Road. The centre of Aidanfield is about from Christchurch city centre. Historic background Father Laurence Ginaty established the Mount Magdala Institute in 1886 to provide a home for women and girls. It developed into an institution caring for women recently released from prison, orphans, and \\"unruly girls\\". Numerous buildings were constructed, and at its peak in the 1930s, 500 people lived on the complex. The St John of God Chapel, designed by Sidney and Alfred Luttrell and now listed as a Category I heritage structure by Heritage New Zealand, was completed in 1912. The Catholic order owned all the land around Mount Magdala, and decided to develop most of it as a subdivision to provide them with financial support. The Press first reported in mid-2000 on the subdivision plans. Naming The suburb is named after Mother Aidan Phelan (1858‚Äì1958), the Superior at Mount Magdala from 1907 to 1920 and again from 1929 to 1936. Mother Aidan was herself named after the Irish saint Aidan of Lindisfarne. The name Aidanfield was approved on 31 January 2001. Subdivision development and amenities The first residents moved into Aidanfield in 2002, and by 2011 some 400 sections had been built on; when the subdivision is fully developed, more than 50 new roads will have been created. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 1320 residents in the Aidanfield area unit. Statistics New Zealand have estimated the suburb's 2010 population at 2400 residents. The subdivision developer caused controversy in 2007 after applying to have four of the five historic Madgala Farm buildings demolished to make way for further subdivision. Although the buildings were protected in the Christchurch City Council District Plan, councillors voted eight to four in favour of granting demolition consent. Staff advice to councillors had been that the \\"farm buildings in their current form have high regional and moderate national heritage significance and therefore should be considered with the Deans‚Äô farm buildings to be the most significant heritage farm buildings remaining in Christchurch.\\" The consent was appealed by Environment Canterbury and the Halswell Residents' Association to the Environment Court, with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a supporting party, but the demolition went ahead. The Halswell Residential College is a school for boys with learning difficulties, from years 7 to 10. Located on Mount Magdala land, the school had a roll of 74 in 2011 and is decile 2. Since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Discovery 1 School and Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti (UPT) have also been using the campus of this school, as they were displaced from the central city. UPT will move to Ilam in 2013, whilst Discovery 1 will remain at the Halswell Residential College. Aidanfield Christian School is a state- integrated school for years 1 to 10. Also on Mount Magdala land, it had a roll of 169 in 2011 and is decile 7. There are no shopping facilities in Aidanfield; the nearest shops are in neighbouring Halswell, about away.

Brian Tyler returned to score the film. It is the sequel to the 2010 action film The Expendables, and stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The story follows the mercenary group known as \\"the Expendables\\" as they undertake a seemingly simple mission which evolves into a quest for revenge against rival mercenary Jean Vilain, who murdered one of their own and threatens the world with a deadly weapon. It is the second installment in The Expendables film series. Principal photography took place over 14 weeks (beginning in September 2011) on an estimated $100 million budget. Film locations included Bulgaria, Hong Kong and New Orleans. Controversy arose over the accidental death of a stuntman and environmental damage caused during filming in Bulgaria. The film was released in Europe on August 16, 2012, and in North America the following day. The Expendables 2 grossed over $310 million worldwide, with its greatest success outside North America. Critics generally considered the film an improvement over its predecessor (citing an increased use of humor and action scenes), but its plot and dialogue received negative reviews. A tie-in downloadable video game was released on July 31, 2012, as a prequel to the events of the film. A sequel, The Expendables 3, was released on August 15, 2014. Plot The Expendables‚Äîleader Barney Ross, knife specialist Lee Christmas, hand-to-hand combat specialist Yin Yang, heavy-weapons specialist Hale Caesar, demolitions expert Toll Road, the unstable Gunner Jensen, and sniper Billy the Kid, the team's newest recruit and Ross' prot√©g√©‚Äîare deployed to Nepal to rescue Dr. Zhou, a hostage. They also rescue the captured mercenary Trench, Ross's rival. Yang leaves the group to escort Zhou back to China. After returning to New Orleans, Billy tells Ross that he intends to retire at the end of the month and live with his girlfriend Sophia. Later, Ross is forced to accept a mission from CIA operative Mr. Church to retrieve an item from a downed airplane in Albania. Church sends technical expert Maggie Chan with the team. In Albania the Expendables retrieve the item, but are then ambushed by international criminal and arms dealer Jean Vilain, his right-hand man Hector and his mercenary group (the Sangs), who have captured Billy. Vilain demands the item in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up the item, but Vilain roundhouse kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain. Maggie tells them that the item is a computer, with the location of five tons of refined plutonium abandoned in a mine by the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Vilain intends to retrieve the plutonium and sell it. The Expendables are able to weakly track the computer's signal and follow Vilain, which leads them to Bulgaria where they stay overnight at an abandoned Russian military base. The next morning, the team is ambushed by the Sangs and a tank. After the Expendables run out of ammunition, they are saved by Ross's old friend, Booker, who quickly eliminates both the Sangs and the tank. Before he departs, Booker informs the group of a nearby village whose residents oppose Vilain. Meanwhile, Hector and Vilain dig up the plutonium and begin collecting it. In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers guarding their children from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately crashing into the mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables. Church and Trench arrive, freeing the miners and the team, and join the Expendables to pursue Vilain. The group intercepts Vilain and his men at an airport as he prepares to leave by plane. Joined again by Booker, the Expendables, Trench and Church engage the Sangs in battle. Christmas decapitates Hector, while Ross and Vilain fight hand-to-hand. Ross defeats Vilain, stabbing him and avenging Billy. In the aftermath, Ross is given an old Antonov An-2 biplane by Church; Church, Maggie, Booker and Trench then leave the team. In France, Sophia discovers a box on her doorstep with a large sum of money and Billy's letter. As the Expendables depart in the plane, they propose a final toast to Billy. Cast alt=Photomontage of the film's stars * Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross: : The Expendables' leader. Stallone insisted on performing his own stunts, ignoring his doctor's advice after several surgeries to repair a broken back and neck injury he received while filming The Expendables. * Jason Statham as Lee Christmas: : The team's knife expert. Statham described his character as \\"kind of a workingman's hero‚Ä¶ a guy you‚Äôd want to go out and have a beer with.\\" * Jet Li as Yin Yang: : The Expendables' hand-to-hand combat expert. Schedule conflicts with Flying Swords of Dragon Gate meant Li could only participate in the film's opening. * Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen: : A volatile member of the team, undone by years of combat stress and alcohol abuse. Lundgren's personal history (including his chemical engineering degree) were incorporated into the character's story by Stallone. Lundgren was hesitant to participate in the film based on the first script draft; however, rewrites and additional content for his character changed his mind. * Chuck Norris as Booker: : A retired military operative on a mission to save his old teammates. The character's name is an homage to the 1978 action film Good Guys Wear Black, where Norris plays John T. Booker. During the film, Booker claims to have been bitten by a cobra and states that the cobra later died as a result; this is a reference to Chuck Norris facts, satirical factoids about the actor. * Terry Crews as Hale Caesar: : The Expendables' barrel-weapons specialist. * Randy Couture as Toll Road: : The team's demolitions expert. Couture described his character as \\"the glue that holds all of these dysfunctional guys together\\". * Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid: : An ex- military sniper, disenchanted after service in Afghanistan. Hemsworth was confirmed for the role on September 19, 2011. He was cast in The Expendables in a similar role as a different character, but his role was written out of the script. Stallone remained in contact with him, offering him a role in the sequel when production began. Stallone described the character as the next generation of the Expendables, who is not as \\"cynical as the other team members\\". * Scott Adkins as Hector: : Vilain's right-hand man. Adkins was offered a role in the original film, but turned it down for Undisputed III: Redemption. * Yu Nan as Maggie Chan: : A CIA agent working for Church who teams with the Expendables to retrieve the lost safe. * Jean-Claude Van Damme as Jean Vilain: : The leader of an opposing team of mercenaries known as the Sangs. Van Damme was intentionally distant from the cast and crew during filming to stay in character. Commenting on the role, Stallone said: \\"We‚Äôll have a big showdown between me and Van Damme, which has been anticipated for a long time, so it should be a good one.\\" Van Damme was offered a role in The Expendables, but ultimately turned it down. * Bruce Willis as Church: : A secretive CIA agent. In late August 2010, Stallone expressed an interest in having Willis return in the sequel (expanding upon his brief cameo in the original) as a potential \\"super-villain\\". Willis was confirmed in a \\"substantial\\" role on September 6, 2011, saying, \\"Hopefully, they'll start shooting it while we're young enough to survive.\\" * Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trent \\"Trench\\" Mauser: : Ross' arch-rival (and occasional ally). Stallone intended to have Schwarzenegger return for a sequel before the release of The Expendables: \\"If this works, I would love to get him in the next one\\". Schwarzenegger's involvement was confirmed on September 6, 2011, his \\"substantial\\" role expanding a cameo appearance in the original film. He filmed his scenes in four days. The cast is rounded out by Charisma Carpenter (reprising her role as Christmas's girlfriend, Lacy), Swedish actress Amanda Ooms as Pilar, opposition leader in the enslaved village and Nikolette Noel as Sophia, Billy's girlfriend. Bulgarian mixed martial artist Lyubomir Simeonov has a cameo as one of the Sangs. Tennis pro Novak Djokovic filmed a cameo as himself (after being invited to participate by producer Avi Lerner), but his scenes were cut from the film. At several stages of development, other actors were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise his role as villain Dan Paine. In November 2010, Charlie Sheen was reported to be in consideration for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Willis' Mr. Church. In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role because he did not find it intriguing. In September 2011, Stallone confirmed that he was in talks with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, and scheduling would be the only obstacle to their involvement. In July 2011, Mickey Rourke was stated to be reprising his role as Tool; by late September it was reported that he had dropped out of the film, and on October 18 this was confirmed. Antonio Banderas was reportedly offered a role, but was unable to participate due to other commitments. Jackie Chan said he had been offered a role, but was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with CZ12. On his approach to casting, Stallone said that he was looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: \\"I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we‚Äôre always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Par√©. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them.\\" Production =Development= Plans for a sequel to The Expendables were in place before the film's release in August 2010; Stallone said, \\"I have an idea ready to go...I'm going to try to do something that's quite radical\\". In an interview in August 2010 he noted that he did not have a new script yet, but \\"It's plotted out in my mind's eye.\\" On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2011, Simon West was confirmed as director. In August 2011, it was reported that Nu Image/Millennium Films was in negotiations with an unnamed Chinese distributor. The distributor would produce the film, in exchange for a Chinese actor (Donnie Yen) being cast and filming in China. The partnership was considered to make a Chinese release of the film easier, and would have granted Millennium Films a larger share of its Chinese revenue. However, the partnership fell apart before production began. However, another Chinese studio, Le Vision Pictures, invested in the film. Lionsgate Films purchased the North American and United Kingdom distribution rights to the film for $35 million. On January 19, 2012, Stallone stated that the film was being aimed at a PG-13 audience. Unlike the first film (which was restricted to viewers over age 17), this would have made the sequel available to all viewers over 13 years of age (and younger children, with parental consent). The reported change received a negative reception. Speaking to Ain't It Cool News about the change, Stallone said \\"The PG-13 rumor is true, but before your readers pass judgement, trust me when I say this film is large in every way and delivers on every level.\\" It was reported that the change was requested by Norris before he would take part in the film, because he did not appreciate the swearing in the script. However, these plans for a more family-friendly rating did not succeed and the finished film was rated R. When the adult-oriented rating was confirmed shortly before release, West stated that \\"the shooting style and the dialogue, from day one, it was R-rated.\\" However, the visual effects supervisor said that The Expendables 2 was shot as a PG-13 film, with all bullet wounds being dust-hits. Once it was decided that the film would be R-rated, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and severed limbs were digitally added in post-production. Van Damme redesigned his final fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. Van Damme was unhappy with the scripted fight, which had his character running away and only a brief confrontation between the pair. He felt that the audience wanted a longer fight scene between the two actors. =Filming= alt=Airport terminal, with small round tables covered with large white tablecloths On a budget of $100 million, principal photography of The Expendables 2 began on September 29, 2011, and lasted 14 weeks. Filming took place largely in Bulgaria: at the Nu Boyana Film studio in Sofia, the city of Plovdiv and the town of Bansko. One of the film's larger set pieces took place at Bulgaria's second-largest airport (in Plovdiv), including gunfights, explosions and car chases throughout the terminal. On October 27, 2011, while the second-unit stunt team was filming at the Ognyanovo Reservoir from Sofia, stuntman Kun Liu was killed and another (Nuo Sun), was critically injured in a staged explosion on a rubber boat. Sun underwent a five-hour operation, which left him in stable condition. Filming also took place at Devetashka Cave in Lovech Province. As part of the cave shoot, BGN600,000 ($408,762) was spent rebuilding a bridge from the cave over the Osam River; only the concrete bridge columns remained from the original structure. Nu Boyana Film Studios announced that the bridge would remain after filming, as a gift to Bulgaria. Other filming locations included Hong Kong and New Orleans, and filming was completed by December 25, 2011. On February 9, 2012, it was reported that The Expendables 2 was in post-production. =Visual effects= alt=Video sample of the film The Expendables 2 contains approximately 1,547 digital effect shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded in response to changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled even if it was not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes. Several sets were rendered digitally, and almost all of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later. The entire opening sequence of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant to take place in tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location. Vehicles also received digital enhancement. For the scene in which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose-mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane, but the craft's design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves, and so it was digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors, and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting. =Controversy= alt=Stone arch with foliage, seen from cave entrance On November 16, 2011, the production received a fine (between $343‚Äì$3,440) from the Bulgarian environmental protection agency for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets to be built in the area (including a bridge to the cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave. However, later that month Bulgarian environmentalists stated that the bat population in the cave had been reduced by up to 75% (from about 30,000 in 2010 to 8,000 in 2011). Nikolay Simov of the Center for Bat Studies and Protection at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences blamed The Expendables 2s production for the reduction. On January 16, 2012, the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Prosecutor's Office overturned a ruling by its Lovech equivalent to prevent an investigation of what environmentalists stated to be an \\"excessive\\" number of dead bats found in the cave after filming (including several endangered species). The European Commission became involved, contacting the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters for information about the dead bats; the Bulgarian Ministry and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences conducted their own probe, stating that the bat kill was within normal parameters. The Veliko Tarnovo Appellate stated that the Lovech Environmental Ministry failed to investigate violations made by The Expendables 2s crew. On February 23, 2012, a Bulgarian court ruled that the crew had violated its filming license. In July 2012 the family of Kun Liu (the stuntman killed during filming) filed a wrongful death suit against the producers of the film, Nu Image and Millennium Films, and stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The suit alleged that conditions for the stunt were unsafe. The Expendables 2 credits contain a dedication to Liu's memory. Music Brian Tyler composed the score for The Expendables 2, who scored the original film. His score combined percussion and electronic elements with orchestral music, and was released as the 14-track album The Expendables 2: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Lionsgate Records on iTunes on August 14, 2012. Several popular songs also appear in the film, including \\"The Wanderer\\" by Dion DiMucci, \\"Mustang Sally\\" by Mack Rice, \\"Crystal Blue Persuasion\\" by Tommy James & the Shondells, \\"Groovin'\\" and \\"Beautiful Morning\\" by The Young Rascals, \\"Rip It Up\\" by Little Richard, \\"I Just Want to Celebrate\\" by Rare Earth, and \\"You Don't Want to Fight with Me\\" by Stallone's younger brother Frank Stallone. Empires Danny Graydon awarded the soundtrack a score of 4 out of 5, and said \\"Tyler‚Äôs action fare is, as ever, superbly judged, mixing real thrills with some dramatic weight... resulting in a score that is affectionately nostalgic and not riddled with clich√©.\\" Graydon singled out the pieces \\"Party Crashers\\" and \\"Track 'Em Find 'Em Kill 'Em\\" for praise. ;Track listing Release =Theatrical= The film premiered on August 8, 2012, in Madrid, Spain, followed by premieres in Paris on August 9, London on August 13 and Hollywood on August 15.

Reception =Box office= alt=Middle-aged, dark-haired man in a black suit and blue tinted glasses The Expendables 2 earned $85,028,192 (27%) in North America and $229,947,763 (73%) in markets elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $314,975,955. This made it the 25th-highest-grossing film of 2012. In the week before its release, North American pre-release tracking estimated that the film would gross between $30-$38 million, making it the number-one film during its opening weekend. Other tracking showed that up to 17% of North American audiences were reluctant to visit cinemas following the mass shooting in a Colorado cinema in late July 2012, which might affect ticket sales. The Expendables 2 earned $10.5 million on its opening day; during its opening weekend, the film earned $28.59 million in 3,316 theaters (an average of $8,622 per theater) finishing as the weekend's number-one film. The gross was 18% lower than The Expendables $34.8 million opening in 2010. The largest demographic for its opening weekend was male (63%) over age 25 (65%). During its second weekend, the movie held the number-one spot with $13.4 million. By its third weekend, analysis showed that the film's gross had fallen behind the original at the same time in its release by $16 million. Outside North America the film grossed $24.7 million during its opening weekend (August 17-19) in 18 markets, including Italy ($1.9 million), Mexico, Russia ($8 million) and the United Kingdom ($3 million). The following weekend (August 24-26) it expanded to a total of 36 markets--including France ($6.1 million), Spain ($2.3 million) and India ($1.8 million)--and grossed approximately $25.9 million to remain the number-one film. The film also had successful September opening weekends in Germany ($4.2 million), Brazil ($3.7 million) and Australia ($3.1 million). Over the September 14-16 weekend, the film's total gross increased to $186 million, outperforming the original film's $171 million. The film was also successful in China, where it grossed approximately $54 million in its first 35 days--making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2012 in the country and outperforming The Dark Knight Rises ($52.5 million) and The Amazing Spider-Man ($48.5 million). =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film garnered an approval rating of 68% based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 5.87/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Taut, violent, and suitably self-deprecating, The Expendables 2 gives classic action fans everything they can reasonably expect from a star-studded shoot-'em-up ‚Äî for better and for worse.\\" Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement over the first film's \\"B+\\". Boxoffices Amy Nicholson compared the film to Fast Five as an \\"over-the-top sequel [that] caters to the lowest common denominator in the best possible way\\", appreciating the characters' unique facets and the use of references from the actors' other films. Of the action scenes, Nicholson said \\"they're glorious nonsense, a guns-blazing bullet barrage\\". The Hollywood Reporters Justin Lowe called the film \\"taut, humorous and attractively packaged\\". Lowe considered Schwarzenegger's brief role to have the most memorable dialogue, noting that he stole any scene in which he was present. On West's direction and cinematographer Shelly Johnson, he said \\"the action choreography never disappoints\\". Varietys Justin Chang appreciated the self- referential humor in each actor's film history and the violent action scenes; however, he felt the scenes were undermined by poor editing and a \\"grimy\\" visual scheme throughout the film. Chang commented that the \\"thrill\\" of seeing all the actors on screen mitigated plot issues. Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum said West's action direction improved upon the previous film's direction by Stallone. Schwarzbaum considered that the film is \\"excellent crap, fine junk, an exercise in campy movie nostalgia\\", commenting that while she did not consider the film artistic, she found it enjoyable. USA Todays Claudia Puig considered the shift from the serious tone of the original to an emphasis on humor to be entertaining. Puig said the film was \\"corny, barbaric and sometimes visually murky. But humor and self-deprecating macho charm make this male pattern badness crowd-pleasing fun.\\" The New York Times Neil Genzlinger judged the film \\"pleasantly-dumb fun if you watch with the right mindset\\", but considered its dialog \\"embarrassing\\" (if intended seriously) and the plot formulaic. Rolling Stones Peter Travers gave the film two (out of four) stars, saying that the film was not even \\"big, dumb fun\\" and criticizing the script; it did not \\"so much defy credulity as bludgeon it to death.\\" The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin gave the film three (out of five) stars. He appreciated the use of stunts and special effects over computerized effects, stating that it \\"gives proceedings a flame-grilled authenticity\\". Collin added, \\"I was thoroughly appalled, mainly at myself for enjoying it.\\" Empires Nick de Semlyen was more critical, labeling it a \\"huge, bulging disappointment\\". Semlyen criticized the plot and what he judged an overuse of references, set pieces and dialogue from the cast's filmography without creating memorable moments of its own. Semlyen praised Van Damme's \\"grandstanding, plutonium-crazed baddie\\" and Lundgren's \\"action-troll\\" as high points. The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton found the violence creative, but said that the film was negatively impacted by self-referencing, \\"joyless one- line nods\\" and \\"outright cash-in cynicism\\" (referring to cameo appearances by some of the actors). Sequel A sequel titled The Expendables 3 began filming in August 2013. The film sees the return of several cast members and the addition of new ones including Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Harrison Ford, and Mel Gibson. The Expendables 3 was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2014.
