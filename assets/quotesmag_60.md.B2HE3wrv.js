Biography Lawton worked briefly in London publishing prior to becoming, by the mid-1980s, a documentary television producer at the newly created Channel 4. In 1993 he settled in New York, and in 1995 won a WH Smith Award for his third book Black Out. He went back into television in England in 1997, and by 1999 had dropped off the TV and books map completely. He returned in 2001 with Riptide (American title: Bluffing Mr. Churchill), which was snapped up by Columbia Pictures. For most of the 21st century, so far, he has tended to be elusive and itinerant, residing in England, the United States and Italy. He appeared in New York, in 2008, with a reading in Greenwich Village.[2] Earlier the same year he was named in the Daily Telegraph (London) as one of \\"50 Crime Writers To Read Before You Die\\". In October 2010 he read in Ottawa, Toronto, Portland and Seattle, ending up at the Mysterious Book Store in Tribeca, and later that year was named in the New York Times Reviews \\"Pick of the Year\\" for his novel A Lily of the Field. Many of the biography pages within Lawton's books have a decidedly tongue-in-cheek bent, with hobbies listed as the \\"cultivation of the onion and obscure varieties of potato\\", or \\"growing leeks\\". Those close to him would stress that such descriptions are meant quite seriously. His author bio notes that \\"since 2000 he has lived in the high, wet hills of Derbyshire England, with frequent excursions into the high, dry hills of Arizona and Italy.\\"Author bio at Grove Atlantic.com (accessed 19 February 2011) Bibliography =Frederick Troy novels= The novels in the Frederick Troy series share the eponymous protagonist Frederick (he doesn't like any form of his given name, preferring to be addressed by his surname) Troy, the younger son of a Russian immigrant father who has become a wealthy newspaper publisher and baronet. Defying class and family expectations, the independently wealthy Troy joins Scotland Yard, becoming an investigator on the \\"murder squad\\". The rights to the fourth novel in the series (Riptide) were purchased by Columbia Pictures several years ago. The rest have been optioned repeatedly, in both England and the US, but, so far, nothing has ever made it to the screen, large or small. The series, in published order: * Black Out (1995), :The story begins during the last stages of the London Blitz in 1944. Sergent Troy is assigned to find out who's murdering German scientists who've been secretly smuggled out of Germany and into Britain. Later, Troy tracks his suspect to Berlin in 1948, during the Berlin Blockade. Along the way, he tangles with British and American spy agencies, a Russian spy and a British femme fatale. * Old Flames (1996), : Chief Inspector Troy, because he speaks Russian, is assigned to guard Russian Secretary-General Nikita Khrushchev, during his 1956 visit to Britain. Along with these duties, Troy investigates the death of an ex-navy diver during a curiously botched spy mission. * A Little White Death (1998), :The third Troy novel uses the historical events of the Profumo affair and the Kim Philby spy scandal of the early 1960s as a jumping-off point for a fictionalized version in which Troy, now risen to Commander in Scotland Yard, discovers that an apparent suicide (of the fictional Stephen Ward-analog character) was really a murder. A second apparent suicide thickens the plot. Most of the historical characters get fictional equivalents, a few appear as themselves, and Christine Keeler becomes a pair of sisters. In the closing Historical Note, however, Lawton explains his historical inspirations and cautions that \\"This is not a roman √† clef.\\" Concurrent with the scandal/spy/murder plot, Lawton interleaves some cultural history on the beginnings of 'swinging London'. The novel's title is a double entendre, referring both to the pills used in the second suspicious suicide and to Troy's life-and-career-threatening battle against tuberculosis. * Riptide (2001), (Published in the United States (2004) as Bluffing Mr. Churchill) :Lawton backtracks chronologically to the early days of World War II, before Black Out. The Americans, not yet in the war, send Calvin M. Cormack to London to find an agent fled from Germany and bring him in for debriefing. He is paired with MI5 officer Walter Stilton and takes Stilton's daughter Kitty as a lover, who is also seeing her ex boyfriend Sergeant Troy of Scotland Yard. When Stilton is killed, Cal joins with Troy to investigate the trail of murders and learn why the agent won't come in. * Blue Rondo (2005) (Published in the United States as Flesh Wounds, ) :This book opens at almost exactly the same point as Black Out, and then skips ten years beyond the end of Black Out to pick up the lives of characters who are only children in the first novel. In 1959 two of them have grown up to be East End gangsters trying to move into the West End, and one has become a policeman working with Chief Superintendent Frederick Troy. There are some similarities to the historical story of the three Kray brothers, but Blue Rondo is set in a very different era and the author has, on occasion, warned against making too much of such analogy. * Second Violin (2007),Essay by the author on the history underlying Second Violin (accessed 19 February 2011) :Another \\"prequel\\" to Black Out, this time back to 1938. The main protagonist this time is Frederick Troy's older brother Rod, working as a reporter for his father's newspaper. Rod travels to Vienna, just in time to witness Kristallnacht. Returning to Britain, he is sent to an internment camp on the Isle of Man because of his Austrian birth and failure to pursue naturalisation. During the Battle of Britain, he is freed to become a fighter pilot. Meanwhile, brother Sergeant Troy investigates the murders of several East End rabbis. The parallel stories eventually converge at the final denouement. * A Lily of the Field (2010), :This novel tells two linked stories, differing in tone and structure, but heading to the same conclusion. The first part, \\"Audacity\\", is set in the years 1934‚Äì46 in Europe, and has only the briefest mention of Frederick Troy. It is, essentially, the back-story to all that follows. The second part, \\"Austerity\\", set in London in 1948, is a more familiar Inspector Troy murder investigation, that, almost inevitably, spills over into Cold War espionage.New York Times Sunday Book Review (accessed 19 February 2011) * Friends and Traitors (2017), :It is 1958. Chief Superintendent Frederick Troy of Scotland Yard, newly promoted after good service during Nikita Khrushchev‚Äôs visit to Britain, is visiting Europe as part of a trip to celebrate his elder brother's birthday. After a concert in Vienna, he is approached by an old friend whom he has not seen for years‚ÄîGuy Burgess, a spy for the Soviets, who says something extraordinary: \\"I want to come home\\". Troy dumps the problem on MI5 who send an agent to debrief Burgess‚Äîbut the agent is gunned down only yards from the embassy, and after that, the whole plan unravels with alarming speed, and Troy finds himself a suspect. As he fights to prove his innocence, Troy finds that Burgess is not the only ghost who returns to haunt him.

His father was a laborer, and upon his father's death, Boreau worked at baths established on the quay of the Loire, upstream of the Cessart bridge. Still a boy, Boreau came under the protection of his godfather Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, an admiral. Boreau was able to study humanities at the college of Saumur. In 1820, he began training to be a pharmacist while working in a dispensary in Angers. Within the framework of these studies, he developed an interest in botany, and he enrolled in courses and studied at the jardin des plantes d'Angers. After his marriage to Antoinette Morin, in 1828, he opened a dispensary in Nevers. He devoted himself to botany and research. He collaborated with Count Jaubert, Minister of Louis Philippe, who shared Boreau's passion for botany.

It opened in 1820, and made a large contribution to the prosperity of the Regent's Canal. By the 1950s, its surroundings were largely derelict, but a programme of regeneration began in 2004, involving several large-scale residential developments, and public access to the basin was provided for the first time in 2009. The basin is used for canoeing by the Islington Boat Club. History Following the completion of the Grand Junction Canal's branch to Paddington Basin in 1801, various plans to link it to the River Thames further to the east were suggested. A scheme to build a canal to the Thames at Limehouse was eventually agreed, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 13 July 1812 to authorise the Regents Canal. The canal was opened from Paddington to Camden Town in 1816, and work on the Islington Tunnel had started, but the company was chronically short of money, as they had failed to raise the original capital, and the cost of construction was anticipated to be much more than the first estimate of ¬£400,000. A third Act of Parliament, (there had been a second one in 1813 to authorise the building of Cumberland Basin), increased the authorised capital to ¬£600,000, but the company had only raised ¬£254,100 of the original amount, and failed to raise any more. A chance meeting between Charles Munro, the chairman of the Regents Canal prior to 1816 and the long-named Committee of the Society for relieving the Manufacturing Poor led to discussions of government loans, and the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission was created under the provisions of the Poor Employment Act 1817, with powers to lend money to public schemes which would create employment for those without work. They agreed to lend the canal company ¬£200,000 if they could find another ¬£100,000, which they succeeded in doing, and in December 1817, work resumed on the canal. In 1819, a fourth Act was obtained, which made provision for the construction of City Road Basin, and removed powers to build a cut to Shoreditch. Another ¬£105,000 was raised and the canal opened on 1 August 1820. The opening celebrations included the arrival of boats from Manchester, which discharged their cargos at the basin and began their journey back to the north on the same day. City Road Basin, close to the eastern end of Islington Tunnel, made a huge contribution to the prosperity of the company, as it was more convenient than Paddington, and was soon acting as a distribution centre for goods into London. Several firms which had become established at Paddington moved to City Road Basin, including the carriers Pickfords. A lucrative trade developed rapidly, and although most of the cargo from the Grand Junction Canal only travelled as far as City Road Basin, there was growing traffic in coal, timber, bricks, sand and other building materials from the eastern end of the canal to locations west of the basin, where building development was flourishing. The privately owned Wenlock Basin was opened in 1826, next to City Road Basin, and passage through the tunnel was speeded up by the provision of a towing boat in 1830. This remained in use until the 1930s, and used a chain on the bottom of the canal, along which it wound its way. Large volumes of goods were being shipped locally, in contrast to the canal's original purpose of transshipping imports to the Midlands. The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 actually increased the tonnage of coal carried by the canal. However, by 1929, with the Midlands trade lost to the railways, and more deliveries made by road, the canal - and this basin - fell into a long decline. Development The basin was always private, with no public access, and by the 1950s had become run-down and derelict. In 2004, Islington Borough Council adopted the City Road Basin Masterplan as an official policy, and work began on the regeneration of the area. Major high-rise buildings were built on parts of the surrounding area, and in each case Section 106 planning obligations ensured that there was funding available to carry out environmental improvements to the basin area. This has allowed the public to access the basin for the first time in its history. The work, which was completed in 2009, has included the provision of public open space at the head of the basin, a landscaped park, and new facilities for the Islington Boat Club, who have been providing canoeing facilities for schools on the basin since 1972.

The Howeitat or Howaytat ( al-·∏§uway·π≠ƒÅt) are a large tribal confederation of Transjordan, an area in present-day Jordan, Palestinian territories and Saudi Arabia. The Howeitat have several branches, notably the Ibn Jazi, the Abu Tayi, the Anjaddat, and the Sulaymanniyin, in addition to a number of associated tribes. History = Formation = Howeitat nomads were recorded as the only tribesmen living in the southern, inland area of the al-Karak-Shawbak sanjak (district) of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.Bakhit, Muhammad Adnan. (1982) The Ottoman Province of Damascus in the Sixteenth Century. Beirut: Libraire du Liban. p. 194. According to the Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din al-Nahrawali (d. 1582), the tribe was a branch of the Banu Uqba, the dominant tribe of the al-Karak-Shawbak region during Mamluk rule (1260‚Äì1516) and whose chieftains were officially recognized by the Mamluk authorities. The Howeitat are unusual in claiming descent from a single ancestor, an Egyptian named Huwayt.Harris, G. Jordan: its people, its society, its culture, HRAF, 1958, p.56 However, according to Kamal Salibi, their presence in the area may date from the 18th century, when tribes of the northern Arabian desert were being pushed northwards by expansion of the Wahhabite-associated bedouin of central Arabia; by the late 18th century the Howeitat were already laying claim to areas around Aqaba and northwards;Salibi, K. The Modern History of Jordan, Tauris, 1998, , pp.26-27 they also laid claim to land in Egypt. They developed into a partly settled tribe, combining farming in the fertile areas of Jabal Shara with pastoralism, but early in the 20th century were rendered more or less nomadic by the activities of two rival shaikhs, Abtan ibn Jazi and Auda abu Tayi, who concentrated on raiding, collection of tribute and camel-herding.Alon, Y. and Eilon, J. The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Tauris, 2007, , p.162 =Role during the Arab Revolt= The abu Tayi subclan of the tribe were supporters of the Hashemite cause during the Arab Revolt, in which they formed an important part of Faisal's forces; Auda abu Tayi was able to muster a force of Bedouin tribesmen willing to march on Aqaba under the banner of Prince Feisal bin Hussein. The ibn Jazi subclan of the tribe remained loyal to the Ottoman Empire: their leader Hamad ibn Jazi was decorated by the empire in early 1917.Teitelbaum, J. (2001) The Rise and Fall of the Hashimite Kingdom of Arabia, Hurst, p.92 In later years the Howeitat returned to farming; they were also prominent in the Arab Legion, the ibn Jazi section becoming the most powerful component in the federation. The Howeitat still have possession of large areas of land around Wadi Rum and stretching into Saudi Arabia; they have historically been a significant source of manpower for the Saudi Arabian National Guard and the Royal Jordanian Land Force. = Present-Day Status and Saudi Displacement = Nowadays, the Howeitat tribe has largely given up its nomadic lifestyle, and settled into villages. On 13 April 2020 a Howietat man named Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti posted videos online announcing that Saudi security forces were trying to evict him and other members of the tribe from their historic homeland to make way for the development of Neom. Alya Abutayah Alhwaiti, a Saudi human rights activist also of the Howeitat tribe, circulated the videos. In the videos Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti said he would defy the eviction orders though he expected Saudi authorities would plant weapons in his house to incriminate him. He was later killed by Saudi security forces, who claimed he had opened fire on them. This version of events was disputed by Alya Abutayah Alhwaiti who said that he did not own firearms. His funeral was held near the village of al-Khoraibah and was well attended despite the presence of Saudi security forces. Eight cousins of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti have been arrested for protesting against the eviction order but Alya Abutayah Alhwaiti said that she and human rights activists in the west hoped to challenge the arrests. Alhwaiti says that the Howeitat are not opposed to the development of Neom, but do not want to be evicted from their traditional homeland. Alya Abutayah Alhwaiti says she has received death threats from people she says are supporters of Mohammed bin Salman. She reported the threats to British police. On 6 October 2020, The Independent reported that ancient Saudi Arabia‚Äôs tribe Howeitat was in danger because of the $500bn (¬£385bn) hi-tech city project called Neom. In recent months the Saudi authorities allegedly arrested, harassed, hounded and even killed members of the tribe on being questioned for their plans and denied the sale of their land to the state.. According to a London-based activist and spokesperson of the tribe, Alya Alhwaiti, and members of the tribe called the United Nations to investigate the matter. Alhwaiti claimed that the kingdom‚Äôs crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman promised the tribe in 2016 to be a part of the Neom project along with a share in the development and improvement of the area. However, in 2020 the Howeitat tribe was instead forced to leave their land without a place to stay in exchange.

The castle was owned by the Pongratz noble family until 1945. That year the Independent State of Croatia was defeated, resulting in the establishment of communist-run Yugoslavia which confiscated most of the former Austro-Hungarian Croatian nobility's property. As part of this, Maru≈°evec was nationalized and the Pongratz's emigrated to Graz, Austria.

That same year he met actress Ruth Draper and commenced a relationship that continued until his death. De Bosis shuttled back and forth between Italy and the United States, where he taught Italian literature at Harvard. In the summer of 1930, De Bosis resigned from the Italy-America Society to found the \\"Alleanza Nazionale\\" and concentrate on the group's mission‚Äîthe clandestine circulation of anti-Fascist newsletters in Italy. Inspired by another anti-Fascist who earlier had flown over Milan dropping leaflets denouncing Il Duce, de Bosis decided to embark upon a similar flight over Rome. The following summer De Bosis took flying lessons.

He reached Rome and circled for half an hour over the city centre, including Piazza Venezia ‚Äì where Mussolini was sitting in council ‚Äì dropping thousands of antifascist leaflets during the crowded evening hour. He was gone by the time the Italian Air Forces responded. The small wooden plane headed out to sea for Corsica never to be seen again.Mitgang, Herbert. \\"A Need to Testify\\", New York Times, May 29, 1984 According to the pilots who had fuelled the plane, he was an inexperienced pilot and had told them that he intended to fly from Nice to Barcelona and back, so his plane had not been fully fuelled. A promising poet, at the time of his death he had been editing a volume of Italian poetry for the Oxford University Press. His papers are saved in Houghton Library, Harvard University. In 1938, actress Ruth Draper made an endowment to maintain a lecture series on Italian culture, history and society, named after De Bosis in Harvard University. In 1973 more funds were supplied by Fiat's Giovanni Agnelli Foundation. De Bosis Committee now grants postdoctoral fellowships, invites visiting professors and organizes Colloquia in Italian studies.

On Friday 11 June 2010, almost two years after its launch, The Guardian reported that NME Radio was to cease broadcasting on DAB digital radio, Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat platforms, and would revert to an online only \\"jukebox\\" format after DX Media had decided to end the agreement to operate the service. On 21 July 2010, IPC Media signed a new licence agreement with local radio group Town and Country Broadcasting.

Drelincourt wrote, that Christ by becoming human through the Virgin Mary did not lose who he was, but began to be what he was not. He approvingly noted that the Council of Ephesus excluded all who did not accept the Theotokos definition.

In the first he was Minister for the Occupied Territories (March ‚Äì October 1930) and then Minister without Portfolio (October 1930 ‚Äì October 1931); in the second (October 1931 ‚Äì May 1932), he served as Minister of Transport. Early life He was the son of a German father and a Scottish mother. After graduation, he became an officer in the Imperial German Navy from 1912 to 1918, holding the rank of lieutenant commander. After leaving the navy, he studied agriculture and in 1921 became director of the Chamber of Agriculture. He was married to Elisabeth Dryander, a travel writer. Career =Party politician (1924 to 1930)= In 1924, Treviranus was elected for the German National People's Party (DNVP) to the Reichstag. From 1925 to 1929 he also was a member of the Landtag of the Free State of Lippe and served as the head of the DNVP's parliamentary group there. As a representative of the moderate wing of the DNVP he rejected the extreme right led by Alfred Hugenberg who became party president in 1928. In the summer of 1929, Treviranus together with Hans Schlange-Sch√∂ningen was one of two prominent DNVP Reichstag deputies who resigned from the party's caucus in protest against the Young Plan referendum bill which they called irresponsible in the extreme, to be joined shortly afterwards by the former chairman Kuno von Westarp and another 20 DNVP Reichstag members leaving the party and forming the more moderate Conservative People's Party (CPP).Wheeler-Bennett, John The Nemesis of Power, London: Macmillan, 1967 page 209. Treviranus politically supported a center-right government coalition. His goal was to align the CPP coalition with the moderate right. The center-right alliance should conduct comprehensive reforms. With this objective, Treviranus had built close relationships and had good contacts. Treviranus has played a significant role in the development of Br√ºning's government in March 1930. In December 1929, he had participated in preliminary discussions with Br√ºning, Kurt von Schleicher, Defence Minister Wilhelm Groener and President Hindenburg's head of office Otto Meissner, at the home of his national conservative party friend Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Willisen.Johannes H√ºrter: Wilhelm Groener.

After the occupation forces were reduced following the Young Plan in June 1930 he became Minister without Portfolio and he liaised with industry for Hindenburg and Br√ºning. Before the General Election of 1930, Treviranus, in co-operation with politically influential military leaders, tried to re-organise the party system. He negotiated forming a loose middle- class electoral alliance to secure a majority for Br√ºning. This was funded by generous donations from big business but it was not successful.Reinhard Neebe: Business, government and the Nazi Party from 1930 to 1933.

From 9 October 1931 to 30 May 1932 he served in Br√ºning's second cabinet as Minister of Transport. The government adopted a right wing nationalist stance during election campaigns and also at cabinet meetings. When French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand submitted a plan for a European Union it was rejected by the entire cabinet, and Treviranus said that the plan was an attack on the current German foreign policy at that time.

Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 1981, p.107 In the parliamentary elections of 31 July 1932, Treviranus lost his seat as did his Conservative People's Party. Treviranus went into business; he became chairman of the Upper Silesian Bata shoe factory. His political career was over at the age of 41.Horst M√∂ller: Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus. Ein Konservativer zwischen den Zeiten. Horst M√∂ller und Andreas Wirsching: Aufkl√§rung und Demokratie. Historische Studien zur politischen Vernunft. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, Munich 2003, p.241 =Escape and emigration= Although almost as much a nationalist as Adolf Hitler, Treviranus was well known for disliking the Nazi leader. He was also Br√ºning's close friend and influential with the military. On 30 June 1934, Treviranus escaped the Night of the Long Knives. While in exile, he recalled that after lunch, a large number of police and SS men entered his house. His father answered their request to see \\"Treviranus\\". Their target and his daughter were playing tennis in the garden when she cried out \\"front of house full of Nazis!\\" He got away by jumping over the garden fence, and climbed into his car which had the key already in the ignition and drove away at high speed. Five rifle shots missed. The assassins followed Treviranus but could not shoot him because he drove into town. He borrowed street clothes from a friend, then went to Schleicher's home and asked an SS guard what was happening. Learning that Schleicher had been shot, Treviranus abandoned his car outside the city to pretend that he had escaped into the countryside, took a taxi back into Berlin, was hidden by friends, and helped into the Netherlands by the same person who had helped Br√ºning to flee.Dieser nannte Treviranus etwa \\"ein[en] Schuft\\" und behauptete: \\"So ein marxistischer (sic!) kleiner Prolet ist in einer Welt gro√ü geworden, die er gar nicht begriffen hat\\", siehe Werner Jochmann (Hrsg.): Monologe aus dem F√ºhrerhauptquartier. Hamburg 1980, p.248 After a few days' stay in the Netherlands, he went to Great Britain. He met many well-known politicians including Churchill and Anthony Eden, at whose behest, he was asked about the character of Hitler and the Nazi movement. He warned of Hitler's aggressive expansion plan. He was formally expatriated in 1939 by the German Reich and at the outbreak of war went to Canada where he worked as a farmer. =Later years (1945 to 1971)= After 1945, Treviranus advised the United States government on the allocation of loans to German companies as part of the Marshall Plan. In 1949, he returned to Germany. In the 1950s, his name became associated with a gambling scandal. In the 1960s, he worked as a defence lobbyist in the West German capital Bonn. He died in 1971 during a stay in Florence.

One of three divisions of BAE Systems Maritime, along with BAE Systems Submarines and BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Maritime Services, it is the largest shipbuilding company in the United Kingdom, one of the largest shipbuilders in Europe, and one of the world's largest builders of complex warships.The Scotsman - VT makes its final shipyard departure with ¬£300m sale It was originally formed as a joint stock subsidiary on 1 July 2008, with the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Shipbuilding, creating a new firm named BVT Surface Fleet. The new firm incorporated the BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions operated shipyards at Scotstoun and Govan on the River Clyde in Glasgow and the VT Shipbuilding facilities within the Naval Base at Portsmouth. BAE Systems subsequently acquired VT Group's share of the joint venture on 30 October 2009 and renamed the business BAE Systems Surface Ships Ltd. On 1 January 2011, BAE Systems Surface Ships was operationally integrated with BAE Systems Submarine Solutions to form BAE Systems Maritime. On 1 January 2012, BAE Systems Surface Ships was formally restructured and rebranded as BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Naval Ships and BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Maritime Services, the former incorporating the shipbuilding operations and combat systems development and the latter in-service support. History =Defence Industrial Strategy= The Ministry of Defence's (MOD) 2005 Defence Industrial Strategy encouraged BAE and VT Group to form a naval shipbuilding joint venture with the aim of maintaining the UK's naval shipbuilding capability in the long-term. In return, in July 2007 the MoD guaranteed the new company a certain amount of work for 15 years, or to pay penalties instead. The Terms of Business Agreement (ToBA) finally signed in July 2009 promised a minimum level of ship build and support activity of around ¬£230 million/year to sustain a warship industry in the UK. The government could cancel the deal at any time, subject to penalties which would decline over the course of the agreement but which would have been ¬£630m at the time of the 2010 SDSR, in lieu of the MoD's existing liability for rationalisation costs under Yellow Book rules.The Yellow Book, formally known as The Government Profit Formula and its Associated Arrangements, is an agreement between the Treasury and CBI governing single-source defence contracts. The MoD is liable for restructuring and redundancy costs when such contracts are cancelled or completed Explaining the rationale for the joint venture from VT Group's perspective, its CEO Paul Lester described shipbuilding as a \\"lumpy\\" business, dependent on large contracts placed at irregular intervals. Another issue was the competition between VT and BAE: \\"We don't want to get into a dogfight with BAE over who would be the survivor... That's what you'd be talking about at some stage.\\" BAE and VT concluded the merger discussions in early 2008, however creation of BVT Surface Fleet was conditional on the signing of contracts for the aircraft carriers. Following the Ministry of Defence's announcement on 20 May 2008 that it intended to proceed with the manufacturing stage of the project, BAE announced its intention to finalise the joint venture arrangements with VT Group. This was completed on 11 June 2008 and, following VT Group shareholder approval on 30 June, the joint venture became operational on 1 July. The logo of the former BVT joint venture from July 2008 to September 2009, when BAE Systems bought VT Group's share of the joint venture. BAE Systems and VT Group owned 55% and 45% of the company respectively, however they had equal board representation and voting rights. In return, VT Group acquired BAE System's 50% share in their other joint venture company Flagship Training, now known as VT Flagship. BVT Surface Fleet subsumed another BAE/VT joint venture, Fleet Support Limited, a ship repair, maintenance and marine engineering company, based within HMNB Portsmouth. The new 15-year Terms of Business Agreement with the Ministry of Defence did result in some controversy however. On 30 June 2009, a BVT memo was leaked which suggested that two of the company's three shipyards could be closed following completion of Queen Elizabeth-class carrier construction. In response to the leak, BVT said the memo was \\"worst-case scenario planning\\" and that it continues to invest in the future of all its yards. However a MOD spokesman said \\"[the MOD] had to look at the consequences of reduced demand for navy shipbuilding.\\" No firm decisions will be taken until after the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 as London has made it clear that it would not buy warships from a foreign shipyard. The preferred plan is to consolidate shipbuilding onto the Govan site and invest ¬£300m in a new covered \\"frigate factory\\" to build the Type 26. =Locations= Launch of a from the covered berths at BAE's Scotstoun Shipyard in Glasgow. BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions own's one shipyard on the River Clyde in Glasgow: Scotstoun (formerly Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd) and runs the second Govan (formerly Kvaerner Govan, Govan Shipbuilders, Upper Clyde Shipbuilders and Fairfields), shipyard that have a corporate heritage extending back as far as 1834. VT Shipbuilding (formerly Vosper Thornycroft) owned shipbuilding facilities completed in 2003 within HMNB Portsmouth and a boatyard, VT Halmatic, in Portchester. These facilities were transferred to BVT Surface Fleet, although the VT Halmatic yard was subsequently sold to Trafalgar Wharf, with the Halmatic Small Boats Centre of Excellence moving to a new facility in Portsmouth Naval Base. BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions also operated an additional project management centre at Filton in Bristol, situated close to key stakeholders at MoD Abbey Wood, which was transferred to BVT. The BAE Systems Submarines Shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness was not included in the joint venture, although since January 2011 Submarines and Surface Ships were operationally integrated under BAE Systems Maritime. =VT Group exit= At the time of BVT's creation, VT Group was expected to eventually sell its minority share to BAE Systems through a put option, but not within three years. However, on 28 January 2009 VT Group announced its intention to sell its share. VT Group's put option valued its share at a minimum of ¬£380 million subject to conditions; however it received ¬£346 million after various payments to BAE. In addition, VT Group agreed to pay ¬£43 million compensation to BVT for cost overruns on contracts with Trinidad & Tobago and Oman that BVT had inherited from VT Shipbuilding. VT Group's net proceeds from the sale of its share in BVT to BAE Systems were therefore ¬£303 million.

Three Type 45 Destroyers undergoing outfitting at the Scotstoun Shipyard's dry dock complex in 2008. Scotstoun is the company's primary centre for the outfitting, testing and commissioning of complex warships. =Aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships= BAE Systems Maritime is undertaking a majority of the workload for the two aircraft carriers, the first of which was floated off in July 2014 and is now undergoing sea trials. As part of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Thales and Babcock are also involved in the project. The company's shipyards have previously had experience of constructing large amphibious assault ships, including the Ocean-class LPH, the Albion-class LPD and the Bay-class LSD(A)s. =Destroyers= BAE's three shipyards all built sections of the Type 45 destroyer, which started as a collaboration between BAE and VT Group. , , , , and have all entered service with the Royal Navy. The first of class entered service in May 2009. In 2007 BAE produced a concept for a UXV Combatant based on a destroyer hull for the operation of unmanned land, air and sea systems. =Frigates and corvettes= BAE Systems Maritime inherited the ¬£400 million Khareef-class corvette project from VT Group, which will see three ships delivered to the Royal Navy of Oman in 2013‚Äì14. BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Naval Ships' yards have also delivered the following in the recent past: * s to the Royal Brunei Navy (Indonesian Navy from 2013) * s to the Royal Navy of Oman * for the Royal Malaysian Navy Design work is currently underway on the Type 26 frigate project for the Royal Navy, as part of the wider Global Combat Ship programme, which will eventually replace the Type 23 frigates currently in service. Construction of the first of class, HMS Glasgow, started on 20 July 2017 with first steel being cut in the Govan shipyard. =Offshore patrol vessels and fast attack craft= VT Shipbuilding was responsible for the construction of four s for the Royal Navy, with through-life maintenance the ongoing responsibility of BAE Systems Maritime; initially the company leased them to the UK Ministry of Defence until the MoD found the money to buy them. The company completed three OPVs based on the Rivers for the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force in 2010. After the contract was cancelled by the Trinidad & Tobago government in September 2010, these vessels were subsequently contracted for delivery to the Brazilian Navy in January 2012 as the Amazonas class. A technology transfer agreement with Bangkok Dock to build a similar OPV, , for the Royal Thai Navy was agreed in June 2009.BVT wins Thailand design contract In 2014 the Royal Navy company signed a ¬£348m deal for three improved Rivers to keep the company busy until Type 26 construction began using money that would have been paid to BAE anyway under the ToBA. BAE Systems Maritime also has a technology transfer agreement in place with Elefsis Shipyards for the construction of the for the Hellenic Navy, which are based on the Barzan (Vita)-class FACs currently in service with the Qatar Armed Forces; itself based upon Vosper Thornycroft's patrol craft built for the Royal Navy of Oman and the Kenya Navy. =Auxiliaries= BAE was initially part of a consortium bidding for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) programme, which was to see up to six replenishment at sea tankers built for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. BAE was partnered with BMT Defence Services and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering ‚Äì the eventual winners ‚Äì for the project, but subsequently withdrew from the consortium before the final round. BAE Systems had previously been prime contractor on the programme for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. =Halmatic small boats= BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Maritime Services operates ship repair and refit facilities within Portsmouth Naval Base. BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Naval Ships' capabilities also extend to Mine countermeasures vessels (The in service with the Royal Navy, Royal Saudi Navy and Estonian Navy), prime contracting on hydrographic survey vessels such as the , Scott class and the design and production of the smaller Halmatic range of boats such as landing craft, rigid-hulled inflatable boats and rigid buoyant boats. These products include the Lifespan Patrol Vessel, Rigid Raider, Mk 6 Assault Boat and Combat Support Boat types currently in service with the British Armed Forces and other Navies, such as the Jordanian Royal Naval Force and the Republic of Singapore Navy. =Support services= BAE Systems Maritime's Support services include supply chain management and logistics support. The BAE subsidiary BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Maritime Services provides through life maintenance, ship repair and drydock refit services for naval and merchant vessels. Past projects have included the reactivation of the Upholder class, now reactivated as the Victoria-class submarines for the Royal Canadian Navy. It has also refitted two ex-Royal Navy Type 22 (Batch 2) frigates for the Romanian Naval Forces and a similar programme for the Chilean Navy involving the refurbishment of three ex-Royal Navy Type 23 frigates. In July 2009, BVT Surface Fleet established the Gulf Logistics and Naval Support joint venture with Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding, to provide in-region maritime support services for CCASG member states.

Introduction of television in Pakistan Syed Wajid Ali also deserves credit for his 'overall vision' for his nation, Pakistan. He was the first person, who in 1961, signed a joint venture agreement with Nippon Electric Company of Japan to initiate a television project in Pakistan. Later, this proved to be a visionary first step in introducing television in Pakistan before it was introduced in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and some other Asian countries. Ubaidur Rahman, an electrical engineer who later became General Manager of Pakistan Television Corporation, Lahore Center, was appointed by him to lead this television project with the Japanese. The project team conducted a series of pilot transmission tests. Then the control of this project was given to President Ayub Khan's government in 1962. A small studio within a tent in the Radio Pakistan compound in Lahore was set up to begin the television project work. Here a transmission tower was also constructed. Finally the first TV black and white transmission from Lahore took place on 26 Nov 1964 and television was introduced in Pakistan.http://www.brecorder.com/weekend-magazine/0:/1156322:history-of-ptv- some-facts/, Syed Wajid Ali's contribution to Pakistan Television Corporation on Business Recorder newspaper, Published 28 Feb 2015, Retrieved 17 Aug 2016  Service to the Red Crescent Movement  His activities in the healthcare sector included his efforts in founding Liaquat National Hospital in 1953 in Karachi of which he was the Chairman.

In 1987, the Company presented The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged), which became an international hit and, eventually, the longest running comedy production in London's West End, where it was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy in 1997. He contributed to the editing and adapting of The Complete Works for publication and television performance. Television After departing from The Reduced Shakespeare Company, Winfield served as a writer for the Daytime Emmy Award-winning series Teacher's Pet (starring Nathan Lane and Jerry Stiller). He worked extensively for Disney's Lilo & Stitch franchise, writing the animated features Stitch! The Movie and Leroy & Stitch (also serving as a dialogue director), executive producing Lilo & Stitch: The Series, and voicing Jumba Jookiba in the English versions of Stitch! and Stitch & Ai.

It is best translated by the word equanimity rather than indifference. The meaning of the word apatheia is quite different from that of the modern English apathy, which has a distinctly negative connotation. According to the Stoics, apatheia was the quality that characterized the sage. Whereas Aristotle had claimed that virtue was to be found in the golden mean between an excess and a deficiency of emotion (metriopatheia), the Stoics sought freedom from all passions (apatheia). It meant eradicating the tendency to react emotionally or egotistically to external events, the things that cannot be controlled. For Stoics, it was the optimum rational response to the world, for things cannot be controlled if they are caused by the will of others or by Nature; only one's own will can be controlled. That did not mean a loss of feeling, or total disengagement from the world. The Stoic who performs correct (virtuous) judgments and actions as part of the world order experiences contentment (eudaimonia) and good feelings (eupatheia). The term was later adopted by Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism, in which apatheia was the soul's freedom from emotion achieved when it reaches its purified state. The term passed into early Christian teaching in which apatheia meant freedom from unruly urges or compulsions. It is still used in that sense in Orthodox Christian spirituality, and especially in monastic practice. Apatheia is contrasted with ataraxia, a related concept in Epicureanism and Pyrrhonism, although some Latin Stoic authors, such as Seneca the Younger use the term interchangeably with apatheia. In Epicureanism ataraxia comes from freedom from pain and fear. In Pyrrhonism it comes from the eradication of disturbing feelings that depend on beliefs about non- evident matters (i.e., dogma).

It is the seventh episode of the fourth season. In this episode, the cast visits a youth who lives in quarantine due to an immune deficiency on the way to Susan's family cabin. The episode was directed by Tom Cherones and written by Larry David and Larry Charles, airing on October 7, 1992.  Plot  Jerry, George, Elaine, and George's girlfriend Susan plan to travel upstate to Susan's family's lakeside cabin. Jerry had a falling out with Naomi, his girlfriend, due to her annoying laugh (which Jerry described to George like \\"Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer.\\") In the coffee shop, a kindly man tells Jerry and Elaine about his son Donald, who lives in a plastic \\"bubble\\" which creates a germ-free sterile environment. Because Donald is a fan of Jerry's, the father petitions Jerry to visit Donald on the way to the cabin to cheer him up. On the trip, exhilarated by the light traffic and the resulting chance to make excellent time, George drives at top speed, leaving Jerry and Elaine behind. As Jerry was relying on George to guide them, they quickly become lost. While waiting for Jerry to arrive, George and Susan play Trivial Pursuit with the \\"bubble boy.\\" Irritated by Donald's taunting and condescension during the game, George disputes the answer to the question: \\"Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?\\" Donald answers \\"the Moors,\\" but due to a misprint, the question card says that the answer is \\"the Moops.\\" George refuses to give Donald credit out of spite, and Donald begins strangling him. When Susan defends George, she accidentally punctures and depressurizes the bubble, causing Donald to collapse, and make George the scapegoat. Jerry and Elaine exit the highway and go to a diner. A waitress there asks for an autographed picture of Jerry (having seen him on TV), who was mispronounced as \\"Gary Seinfield.\\" Elaine pokes fun at what Jerry wrote, causing him to regret it, so he asks for it back. The waitress refuses, and it escalates to the point of the waitress attacking Jerry. Two men burst in and announce that Donald was attacked, and that his house is right down the street from the cafe. Jerry and Elaine meet up with George and Susan at the house just as Donald is being carried out by paramedics; he sarcastically thanks Jerry for showing up too late and claims George tried to kill him. George and Donald argue a bit more before the residents of the town chase the men and women away. Meanwhile, Naomi called Jerry's answering machine, explaining that she decided rejoin Jerry for the trip; Kramer answers in his place. They attempt to rendezvous with Jerry, Elaine, George, and Susan at Susan's family's cabin. Kramer carelessly leaves one of his lit Cuban cigars near some newspapers, which causes a fire that destroys the cabin. The other four travelers arrive shortly after the firefighters as Kramer rushes back into the cabin in a last-ditch attempt to save the cigars. Production The \\"Moops\\" misprint incident was based on a real-life incident that occurred to one of the Seinfeld writers while playing the \\"Jeopardy! The Board Game\\" (9th Edition, 1972). Eponymous computer virus On November 10, 1999, a computer virus named \\"BubbleBoy\\" was discovered, apparently named after this episode. This was the first malware of its kind, having been able to activate itself (via an embedded Visual Basic script) upon the recipient opening the e-mail contents, as opposed to running an attachment. As such, in spite of not being dangerous, the virus changed the concept of antivirus technology.

The castle of Drivenik is first mentioned in 1228 as one of the co- signers of the Vinodol Code. It is near the village of Drivenik in the Vinodol region, on a high point named \\"Glavica\\", above sea level. The castle sits in front of the mountain range called ‚ÄòKri≈æi≈°ƒáe‚Äô opposite Tribaljsko polje (Tribalj field). It is in a small village of Drivenik, near a larger village of Tribalj, around from Crikvenica. From the 13th century the castle was the seat of the district administration, and upon the arrival of the Frankopans, their deputy Dragoljub resided there in 1288. In the 16th century (1571 based on an inscription on its walls) the castle was expanded in size and in the style of Renaissance fortresses it received round towers on its corners. Then in 1577, the castle was ruled by the noble family Zrinski. The construction of the road in 1746 linked Drivenik to Novi Vinodolski and Bakar. This allowed the inhabitants to move from the hilltop down into the valley where present day Drivenik village developed along the roadway. Ultimately the castle was abandoned as an active settlement, only the church of Sveti Dujam (St. Domnius) and its cemetery remained as active properties. Near the castle is the chapel of St. Stephen, built probably at the end of the 16th century with its tower containing three bells. The church has three building phases: Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque. The church originally contained a late Gothic period 'Pieta' sculpture titled the \\"Mourning of Christ\\" and a Baroque period wood carved \\"Golden Altar\\". Today both are in the Museum of Art and Crafts in Zagreb. The chapel of St. Martin is situated at the cemetery. It has Baroque frescoes dating from the 18th century. On its wall is a fresco \\"Taken down from the Cross\\". There is the Way of the Cross with four shrines near the cemetery and at its end Calvary is marked with three high crosses dating from 1768. The cemetery also contains a monument to fallen fighters from World War II. The parish church of Sveti Dujam (St. Domnius) contains three naves and a bell-tower in the front. Originally it was built with one nave, without the open bell-tower. Sveti Dujam's bell tower was built in 1806 and the entrance beneath the bell tower was constructed in 1846. The sanctuary was decorated by Anton Cej in 1894 when the main marble altar was constructed. The church floor contains burial vaults with the remains of a prominent local family Klariƒá (Gaspar 1653 and Marko 1753). The church underwent partial restoration in 1968. In the nearby town of Drivenik, a monument has been erected to the famous Croatian miniaturist J.J. Kloviƒá (Julio Clovio).

He inherited a 20% stake in Walthamstow Stadium when his father Victor Sr. died in 1974.  Off-shore bookmaking  Victor Chandler is often credited as the first bookmaker to recognise the importance of online gambling, as well as being the first to move his gaming business offshore. In the early 1990s, Victor began to accept football wagers from far- eastern clients and, in doing so, he recognised the potential growth in foreign markets. He opened up an office in Antigua to enable these clients to bet without the need to pay UK tax. In the UK, punters were required to pay a 9% betting tax but, in 1996, Chandler obtained a betting licence in Gibraltar and in 1999 moved his entire business there. Over the next decade the company grew quickly and he now employs over 400 people and is the largest private employer on the Rock. Victor Chandler has offered free betting from ¬£5, and in 2001 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced that he was scrapping UK betting tax.  Horse ownership  Chandler has owned many racehorses over the past three decades in UK, South Africa & US. Following some success over the years, Chandler formed a syndicate called \\"Men in Our Position\\" which owned the 2009 Cheltenham Triumph Hurdle winner Zaynar, trained by Nicky Henderson. Zaynar re-appeared on 21 November 2009 at Ascot Racecourse where he demolished a top-class field in winning the Coral Ascot Hurdle by 6 lengths as reported by the Racing Post. Zaynar was then aimed at the Champion Hurdle, for which he was one of the Ante-Post favourites for the race. After running a galant race Zaynar finished third in the race.  Personal wealth  In the 2009 Sunday Times rich list Chandler was ranked 362nd with a fortune estimated at ¬£150 million, falling from the previous year's estimation of ¬£365 million.  Lucian Freud friendship  In an article in the Observer in June 2008 Victor spoke of his friendship with the artist Lucian Freud, and mentioned the portrait of Victor which Freud completed which was sold for ¬£4.5m in 2006.  Nottingham Forest  In July 2009 Victor Chandler agreed to become the main sponsor of Nottingham Forest F.C. for a reported \\"significant six-figure fee\\". As part of his sponsorship he offered to pay for the following year's season tickets for Forest fans who opened an online account should Forest win the league. At the time of the offer Forest were rated as 80/1 outsiders to do this, but after a run of 19 games undefeated, Forest were second in the Championship in January 2010 and Chandler claimed Forest winning the league would cost him approximately ¬£6m. After a poor March and April Forest's chances of winning the league receded and they instead qualified for the Football League play-offs where they were eliminated by Blackpool at the semi-final stage.

Said to be very beautiful, according to the chronicle of Laonikos Chalkokondyles, she was accused by her son, John Megas Komnenos, of having an affair with the protovestiarios of the court of Trebizond; however, other accounts describe her as a faithful and loving wife, who kept the peace between Alexios and his sons. In either case, during her lifetime their son John fled to Georgia and did not return until after Theodora's death. Family Theodora's parentage is described by the Byzantinist Donald Nicol as \\"obscure\\". The Ecthesis Chronica implies she was the daughter of a holder of the military rank of protostrator, and Nicol notes there are chronological grounds against identifying her father with one Manuel Kantakouzenos who was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sultan Mehmet I in the winter of 1420-1421.Donald M. Nicol, The Byzantine family of Kantakouzenos (Cantacuzenus) ca. 1100-1460: a genealogical and prosopographical study (Washington, DC: Dumbarton Oaks, 1968), p. 168 However, Thierry Ganchou has provided evidence that indicates Theodora was the oldest daughter of Theodore Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, uncle of emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, and Euphrosyne Palaiologina, and names her brothers in order of birth as Demetrios, protostrator Manuel, George, megas domestikos Andronikos, and Thomas. He argues that this evidence was ignored due to undue reliance on the writings of Theodore Spandounes, who wrote long after more reliable contemporary sources.Ganchou Thierry, \\"Une Kantakouz√®n√®, imp√©ratrice de Tr√©bizonde: Th√©od√¥ra ou H√©l√©na?\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 58 (2000), pp. 215-229  Life  Born in Constantinople around 1382, Theodora was only thirteen when she became in 1395, the consort of the co-emperor Alexios IV of Trebizond, who was approximately the same age. She became ruling empress when her husband became sole emperor in Trebizond at the death of her father-in-law the emperor Manuel III, in 1417. A passage in the History of Chalkokondyles states that Theodora became the mistress of the protovestiarios of the court of Trebizond, an act of adultery which provoked her son, John IV, to murder the official then imprison his parents in the palace. His parents were rescued by the archons of the city who sent John into exile in Georgia.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 81 However this passage is considered to be one of several interpolations into Chalkokondyles' History; a scribe in one line of the text's transmission notes the difference in style, adding a note at the beginning of the passage that \\"this seems to have been written by someone other than Laonikos\\", and at the end of the passage ends another note reading \\"from here on it is Laonikos\\".Anthony Kaldellis, \\"The Interpolations in the Histories of Laonikos Chalkokondyles\\", Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, 52 (2012), p. 260 Further, the story is contradicted by the chronology and other sources. It may be the writer of this story has confused with an earlier affair between a member of the imperial dynasty of Trebizond and a protovestiarios, namely Manuel III, the father-in-law of Theodora.Nicol, Byzantine Family, p. 170 n. 22 This scandal is reported by the Spanish traveller Ruy Gonz√°les de Clavijo, who visited Trebizond in 1404 not long after the event. He adds that this scandalous relationship induced the young Alexios IV, Theodora's husband, to rebel against his father Manuel.Clavijo, Narrative of the Embassy of Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo..., translated by Clements R. Markham (London: Hakluyt Society, 1859), p. 62 Manuel III died on 5 March 1417. Alexios IV succeeded him with Theodora as his Empress consort. She remained Empress for nearly a decade to her own death at the third hour of the night. Theodora was buried in the Church of Theotokos Chrysokephalos in the cemetery of Gidon with the other Emperors of Trebizond.Nicol, Byzantine Family, p. 169 It appears that it was only after the death of Theodora (1426) that John IV rebelled against his father, because his late mother could no longer mediate the increasing rivalry between father and son. On the contrary, the virtue, the piety, and the fidelity of Theodora are celebrated by her compatriot, the scholar Basilios Bessarion, in the three monodies he dedicated to his benefactress, and in a special discourse of consolation addressed to Alexios IV, devastated by the death of his beloved empress. Last but not least, John IV himself, after his accession to the throne in 1429, paid homage to the virtues of his deceased mother in a chrysobull benefiting the convent she founded.Th.

Part of the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. It operates the Boeing RC-135 aircraft conducting reconnaissance missions. Mission The mission of the 38th Reconnaissance Squadron is to provide RC-135 aircraft and personnel to conduct global reconnaissance for national intelligence agencies, key decision makers and warfighters. History =World War II= Established in late 1942 as a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter squadron, trained under Second Air Force in the Pacific northwest. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations, assigned to VIII Fighter Command in England in late 1943. Squadron's mission was to provide long range fighter escort for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers on strategic bombing missions over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. In April 1944 received P-51D Mustang fighter aircraft and continuing its primary task of escorting B-17 and B-24 bombers that attacked such targets as industries and marshalling yards in Germany, and airfields and V-weapon sites in France. The squadron flew air patrols over the English Channel and bombed bridges in the Tours area during the Invasion of France in June 1944. In July the squadron attacked gun emplacements during the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough. The unit patrolled the Arnhem sector to support the Airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September 1944, and later in December, transportation facilities during the Battle of the Bulge. During the Western Allied invasion of Germany, the squadron flew ground support missions by strafing trucks, locomotives, and oil depots near Wesel when the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945 and continued offensive operations until 21 April 1945. P-38Hs of the 38th Fighter Squadron. After the German Capitulation, became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe Army of Occupation, at AAF Station Kaufbeuren, then moved to AAF Station Giebelstadt in early 1946 where it received its first jet aircraft, the Lockheed P-80A Shooting Star. Inactivated in August 1946 when personnel were demobilized and aircraft were transferred to the 31st Fighter Group. =Cold War reconnaissance= Reactivated by Strategic Air Command in 1947 as a reconnaissance squadron, equipped with Boeing RB-17 Flying Fortress aircraft. Flew aerial photography, mapping, charting, and photo reconnaissance missions, some of which flew around borders of the Soviet Union and over the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany. Little was known about the air defense capability of the Soviet Union at this time and the most effective way of determining their capability was to probe the borders and see whether they would respond. Gradually the RB-17s and other aircraft mapped the perimeter of the Soviet Air Defenses from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. Upgraded to Boeing RB-29 Superfortress aircraft in 1949 and continued its reconnaissance mission, however inactivated in 1949 due to budget reductions. Reactivated in 1950 at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico, again flying RB-29s performing strategic reconnaissance, charting photography, precise electronic geodetic mapping, and electronic reconnaissance missions, upgrading to Boeing RB-50 Superfortresses in 1952. Equipped in 1953 with Boeing RB-47E Stratojets and conducted a variety of classified overflights of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. Some of these flights were mounted from Thule in Greenland and probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking a photographic and radar recording of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. Flights which involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed SENSINT (Sensitive Intelligence) missions. One RB-47 even managed to fly 450 miles inland and photograph the city of Igarka in Siberia. Beginning in 1958, used 3 specially modified Stratojets, known as EB-47Es (Tell Two), in Operation Iron Work to monitor Soviet missile tests from Baikonur, Tyuratam and Kapustin Yar. The early EB-47E 'Tell Two' was easily recognizable as the aircraft were equipped with 2 large telemetry pods attached to either side of the fuselage, just aft of the nose, which intercepted data from Soviet data from missile tests. A later version of the 'Tell Two' housed the telemetry pods internally and had a streamlined nose. The USAF long range radar site at Samsum in Turkey, on the south coast of the Black Sea, also assisted in this activity. Missions flown on a reduced scale after February 1958 when events showed the vulnerability of the RB-47 to Soviet air defenses and the development of the U-2 aircraft. When the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing relocated to Offutt Air Force Base on 16 August 1966, the 38th took over the Operation Looking Glass mission from the 34th Air Refueling Squadron and operated Boeing EC-135C as well as operating 3 KC-135R Rivet Stand reconnaissance aircraft. On 1 April 1970 SAC reorganized the Post Attack Command and Control mission and the 38th inactivated and turned the mission over to the newly 2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron. The squadron flew worldwide strategic reconnaissance including in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Operation Urgent Fury in October 1983, Operation El Dorado Canyon in April 1986, Operation Just Cause in December 1989, and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm from January‚ÄìFebruary 1991.

It is thought that the castle lies at the exact spot of an ancient Illyrian and Roman fortress. The Croatian noble Vuk Krsto Frankopan is buried in one of the churches. The Trsat castle was completely reconstructed and renovated in the 19th century when the mausoleum of the military commander Laval Nugent was built in its interior. The courtyard of the castle has now been turned into a restaurant and many tourists visit the place during the summer months. View of Trsat and Trsat Castle from WSW, from Rijeka mountain area. History The thirteenth century Trsat castle, whose site has been in use from Roman days for being an easy place from which to control access to the sea along the Rjeƒçina River, is situated on the steep hill overlooking the Rjeƒçina gorge on its left bank, just above the town of Rijeka. It may be that a Iapodian hill-fort, Darsata, used to be there, after which the Roman fortification Tarsatica was named. This Roman fort was of vital importance on a road that connected Aquileia to Pannonia and Senia (Senj). It was owned by Frankopan family who built the present castle, on the site occupied by the Illirian Tarsatica, to protect their holdings in Vinodol.Jeanne Oliver, Croatia, pg. 98, Lonely Planet, 4th ed. (2007), The capture of the Castle of Trsat compelled the Ban of Croatia, Andrew Bot of Bajna (Bajna is a village in Hungary, near Esztergom)), to intervene in the Austro-Venetian war, and in June 1509 he first recaptured Trsat with his Croatian army and then entered Rijeka after expelling the Venetians. In October 1509, the Venetians withdrew for good and Rijeka returned to the possessions of Maximilian of Habsburg. This notable episode is the sole event which links Rijeka with Venice, and consequently with Italy, during the whole of its history from the 7th century on.Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá, Abridged political history of Rieka (Fiume): (with a facsimile), pg. 06, Impr. \\"Graphique\\" (1919), ASIN B00087CNQ4 In the 17th century the castle fell into decay due to the receding threats from Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Its decline was accelerated by the earthquake of 1750. In the year 1811, during the Napoleonic wars, Captain Hoste in pursuit of the French, arrived with his frigate at Fiume where he made himself lieutenant-governor. The situation in Trieste soon drew him away, but in 1826 he had the satisfaction of handing the castle over to Field-Marshal Nugent, an Irishman then commanding the Austrian troops in the vicinity, for the purpose of conferring on him the rank of an Austrian noble. The general was later honoured by the Austrians and presented with the castle at Trsat as his residence.Harry Hodgkinson, The Adriatic Sea, pg. 160, Macmillan (1956), ASIN B003PEVDL8 He had it restored in Neo-Gothic style and built a mausoleum adorned with the coat of arms of the Nugent family. It remained in the Nugent family until nearly the end of the Second World War when the general's great-granddaughter, Countess Nugent, died at the age of 82.

In 1993, Pope John Paul II declared him a Servant of God, the first stage on the path to canonization. In 2013, Kapaun posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions in Korea. He is the ninth American military chaplain Medal of Honor recipient. Early life Emil Joseph Kapaun was born on April 20, 1916, and grew up on a farm three miles southwest of Pilsen, Kansas on rural 260th Street of Marion County. His parents, Enos and Elizabeth (Hajek) Kapaun, were Czech immigrants.https://guadalupeclinic.com/programs/support-for-catholic- schools-inc/1838-fr-kapaun/info-1838/20306-booklet-on-father-emil-j- kapaun-20306 He graduated from Pilsen High School in May 1930. Kapaun also graduated from Conception Abbey seminary college (College of New Engleberg; Conception Seminary College) in Conception, Missouri, in June 1936 and Kenrick Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1940. Priesthood On June 9, 1940, Kapaun was ordained a Catholic priest at what is now Newman University in Wichita, Kansas. He celebrated his first Mass at St. John Nepomucene Catholic Church in Pilsen, Kansas. In January 1943, Kapaun was appointed auxiliary chaplain at the Herington Army Airfield near Herington, Kansas. In December 1943, Kapaun was appointed pastor to replace Fr. Sklenar who had retired. He served in the Pilsen area under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita. U.S. Army service =World War II= Kapaun entered the U.S. Army Chaplain School at Ft. Devens, Massachusetts in August 1944, and after graduating in October began his military chaplaincy at Camp Wheeler, Georgia. He and one other chaplain ministered to approximately 19,000 servicemen and women. He was sent to India and served in the Burma Theater from April 1945 to May 1946. He ministered to U.S. soldiers and local missions, sometimes traversing nearly 2,000 miles a month by jeep or airplane. CBI Saint, Father Emil J. Kapaun He was promoted to captain in January 1946. He was released from active duty in July 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Education at Catholic University of America in February 1948. In September 1948, he returned to active duty in the U.S. Army and resumed his chaplaincy at Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas. In December 1949, Kapaun left his parents and Pilsen for the last time, bound for Japan. =Occupation of Japan= In January 1950, Kapaun became a chaplain in the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, often performing battle drills near Mount Fuji, Japan. On July 15, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division and Kapaun embarked and left Tokyo Bay sailing for Korea, less than a month after North Korea had invaded South Korea. Father Emil Kapaun celebrating Mass using the hood of a jeep as his altar, October 7, 1950 =Korean War= 1st Cavalry Division The 1st Cavalry Division made the first amphibious landing in the Korean War on July 18, 1950. The Division was soon moved up to help slow the advance of the North Korean Army until more reinforcements could arrive. The Division engaged in several skirmishes with the enemy but had to retreat each time. During one of these retreats, Chaplain Kapaun and his assistant learned of a wounded soldier stranded by enemy machine gun and small arms fire. Knowing that no litter bearers were available, the two braved the enemy fire and saved the man's life, for which Kapaun was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with a \\"V\\" device for valor. Despite Kapaun's bravery, the North Koreans continued to push the U.S. forces back into a perimeter around the port city of Pusan. Kapaun continued to make the rounds to encourage and pray with the troops of the 8th Regiment. 1st Cavalry Division Historical Overview His main complaint was lack of sleep for several weeks at a time. Finally, in mid- September and after the Marine landing at Inchon, Kapaun and the rest of the UN forces broke out of the perimeter and pursued the enemy northward. On October 9, the division crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea, capturing the capital of Pyongyang and advancing within 50 miles of the Chinese border. Throughout the months of fighting, Kapaun gained a reputation for bravely serving the troops, rescuing the wounded and dead, and ministering to the living by performing baptisms, hearing confessions, offering Holy Communion and celebrating Mass on an improvised altar set up on the front end of a Jeep. Several times his Mass kit Jeep, and trailer were destroyed by enemy fire. In letters home, he shared that he was thoroughly convinced that it was the prayers of others that helped him escape. POW The United States forces progressed northward in hopes of ending the war but were met by a surprise intervention by China. The first engagement with this new enemy took place at the Battle of Unsan near Unsan, North Korea, on November 1‚Äì2, 1950. Nearly 20,000 Chinese soldiers attacked Kapaun's 8th Regiment. Despite pleas for him to escape, the chaplain stayed behind with the 800 men of the 3rd Battalion as the rest of the Regiment retreated. During the battle, he braved enemy fire and rescued nearly 40 men, an action for which he was later awarded the Medal of Honor. The Chinese continued to overwhelm the American troops, and he and other members of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment taken prisoner were marched to a temporary prison camp at Sombakol near the permanent camp (Prison Camp 5) at Pyoktong, North Korea, where they were later held. Kapaun was able to persuade some prisoners, who had ignored orders from officers, to carry the wounded.VFW magazine, \\"Korean War\\", \\"Courage Beyond Belief\\", p. 31 Life in the prison camp was challenging, with sometimes up to 2 dozen men dying a day from malnutrition, disease, lice and extreme cold. Kapaun refused to give in to despair and spent himself entirely for his men. He dug latrines, mediated disputes, gave away his own food, and raised morale among the prisoners. He was noted among his fellow POWs as one who would steal food for the men to eat. He also stood up to Communist indoctrination, smuggled dysentery drugs to the doctor, Sidney Esensten, and led the men in prayer. Death and burial Kapaun developed a blood clot in one of his legs besides having dysentery and pneumonia. Weakened as the months passed, he managed to lead Easter sunrise service on Sunday, March 25, 1951. He was so weak that the prison guards took him to a place in the Pyoktong camp they called the \\"hospital\\" where he died of malnutrition and pneumonia on May 23, 1951. Kapaun was buried in a mass grave near the Yalu River. He was one of twelve chaplains to die in Korea.

Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also agreed.

Retrieved Feb. 1, 2014 His Medal of Honor citation reads: Cause of beatification and canonization The following is a general narrative from the many reports of Kapaun's ordeal as a prisoner of war given by many repatriated American soldiers after their release from prison camps. He was most remembered for his great humility, bravery, his constancy, his love and kindness and solicitude for his fellow prisoners. \\"He was their hero... their admired and beloved \\"padre.\\" He kept up the G.I.'s morale, and most of all, allowed a lot of men to become good Catholics.\\" Reports received noted that Kapaun's feet had become badly frozen, but that he continued to administer to the sick and wounded. He continuously went out under heavy mortar and shelling to rescue wounded and dying soldiers at personal risk of being captured or killed. Many accounts have been given of the many creature comforts he provided his comrades of the 8th Cavalry Regiment during imprisonment. They were both spiritual and physical. He provided endless hours of prayer and what nourishment he could find to all he could to keep them from starving to death. A detailed account of Kapaun's life is recounted in Fr. Arthur Tonne's Chaplain Kapaun: Patriot Priest of the Korean Conflict: > In a very definite sense, we are all beneficiaries from the life of Fr. > Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed > on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of > dauntless bravery ‚Äì of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us > a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of > our country's greatest enemy ‚Äì godlessness, now stalking the world in the > form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. > Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or > beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul ‚Äì the spirit of one who loved > and served God and man ‚Äì even unto death. When Kapaun was assigned to the 8th Cavalry Regiment, which was surrounded and overrun by the Chinese army in North Korea in October and November 1950, he stayed behind with the wounded when the Army retreated. He allowed his own capture, then risked death by preventing Chinese executions of wounded Americans too injured to walk. Following his death, as Kapaun's actions became known, Catholic faithful began to offer devotional prayers to him; these prayers came from U.S. servicemembers, laymen and women across the United States, as well as those in East and Southeast Asia. In 1993, Kapaun was named a Servant of God by Pope John Paul II, the Vatican's first step toward possible canonization. On November 9, 2015, the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita in Wichita, Kansas, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Bishop Carl A. Kemme, presented the positio, a 1,066-page-long report on his life, ministry, virtues, holiness, and other aspects, that must be compiled by the sponsoring diocese, approved by the Bishop, and sent to Rome for review, to the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in the Roman Curia at the Vatican, His Eminence, Angelo Cardinal Amato. If the Congregation and the Pope approve this report, he will be given the title Servant of God. Then, if they determine that he lived a life of virtue, he can also be called Venerable. If a declaration of martyrdom is then granted by the Pope, or the Pope approves a miracle posthumously attributed to Father Kapaun, he can be beatified. A team of six historians gathered on June 21, 2016, and voiced their approval to the cause. =Possible 2006 miracle= In 2006, Avery Gerleman, who had an auto-immune disorder, entered into an 87-day coma due after multiple organs were damaged. Her parents and others prayed for Fr. Kapaun‚Äôs intercession, and she recovered. Later scans of her damaged lungs and kidneys showed no signs of scarring. Avery went on to become physically active, earned her license to become a licensed practical nurse at Wichita Area Technical College, and plans on becoming a registered nurse. =Possible 2008 miracle= On June 29, 2008, the opening ceremony which officially opens the cause for sainthood for Kapaun was made on Father Kapaun Day held at St. John Nepomucene Catholic Church in Pilsen, Kansas. On June 26, 2009, Dr. Andrea Ambrosi, the Roman Postulator for Kapaun's cause for canonization arrived in Wichita in order to interview doctors in relation to alleged miraculous events. Among these is the claim of 20-year-old Chase Kear, who survived a severe head injury last year in part, he and his family claim, because they petitioned Fr. Emil Kapaun to intercede for them. Kear, a member of the Hutchinson Community College track team, fell on his head during pole vaulting practice in October 2008, but, it is said, was miraculously healed despite being near death. The Rev. John Hotze, the judicial vicar for the Diocese of Wichita, and trained in canon law, will assist in investigating Kear's case. Hotze has spent eight years investigating the proposed sainthood of Kapaun. The Catholic Church has considered canonizing Kapaun ever since soldiers were liberated from Korean prisoner-of-war camps in 1953 and told of Kapaun's heroism and faith. The Wichita Diocese has continued to receive reports of miracles involving Kapaun. He is being considered for possible designation as a martyr. =Possible 2011 miracle= On May 7, 2011, Nick Dellasega collapsed at a Get Busy Living 5K race in Pittsburg, Kansas (honoring the memory of Dylan Meier). Due to a series of coincidences, Dellasega survived, even though he had seemingly died on the scene. His childhood friend, EMT Micah Ehling, is quoted by The Wichita Eagle as saying \\"I know what a face looks like when the soul leaves the body. And that's what Nick looked like\\". Some bystanders attribute Dellasega's survival to the devotion of his cousin, Jonah Dellasega, who fell to his knees at the scene and prayed for Kapaun‚Äôs intercession. In a strange coincidence not reported by The Eagle, Dylan Meier, in whose memory the 5K was being held, was slated to teach English in Korea at the time of his death. Skeptics point out that Kapaun's spirit could not possibly have orchestrated the bizarre coincidences that saved Nick's life because some of them were set in motion long before Nick collapsed, including a visit by Nick's uncle, Mark, a medical doctor from Greenville, North Carolina. Divine providence, however, can be viewed as having set in motion all of the events. The Eagle reported, \\"The coincidences are strange enough and the prayer notable enough that a Catholic Church investigator has reported Nick's story to the Vatican, which happens to have a representative in Wichita again, sizing up Father Emil Kapaun for sainthood.\\" Memorials * Kapaun Memorial Chapel; Seoul, South Korea; dedicated November 4, 1953. * Kapaun Religious Retreat House; ≈åiso, Japan; dedicated December 1954. * Kapaun Barracks and Chapel at Air Force Administrative Annex; Kaiserslautern Military Community, Kaiserslautern, Germany; dedicated June 7, 1955. * Father Kapaun Memorial Technical School; Kwanju, Korea; dedicated Summer 1955. * Chaplain Kapaun Memorial High School; Wichita, Kansas; dedicated May 12, 1957.

By 1958 he had become the fencing master at the University of California at Berkeley. His success there, aided by World Champion saberman Daniel Magay, was immediate. The University of California 1958 Cal Blue and Gold Yearbook stated: \\"Coach George Piller in his first year at Cal, trained a championship team. The future looks very promising for fencing at the University of California. After a long struggle for survival without the services of a coach, Cal fencers were fortunate in getting George Piller to serve as their coach, since Mr. Piller is considered one of the world's greatest fencing masters.\\". The 1959 Yearbook continued: \\"Cal's Fencing Team, coached by famed Hungarian Master George Piller, enjoyed a successful 1958-59 The Bears beat Stanford, San Jose State, SF State, University of Arizona, and the Air Force Academy to emerge as champions of the Western Intercollegiate Fencing Conference.

Piller also became the fencing master at the Pannonia Athletic Club, whose fencers also won many championships at the amateur level. Some of his notable students included Daniel Magay, Maestro Charles Selberg and John McDougall. Piller died from a terminal illness in San Francisco, California, on September 6, 1960. The high calibre of his successors was a testament to his greatness: he was followed at University of California Berkeley by Maestro Julius Palffy-Alpar and his successor at Panonia Athletic Club was Maestro Ferenc Marki.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals, Detroit Tigers, and Cincinnati Reds. Balester has also played for the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. Balester was drafted by the Montreal Expos in 2004, making his professional debut that year. By 2007, he was considered a top prospect for the newly relocated Nationals, with him participating in that season's All-Star Futures Game. On July 1, 2008, he made his MLB debut with the Nationals, winning in his debut as a starter, becoming the first Expo or National to do so since 1999. That season, he went on to make 14 starts for Washington, recording a 5.51 earned run average (ERA). In 2009, Balester began the season in Triple-A with the Syracuse Chiefs. He split the year between Syracuse and Washington, making a combined 27 starts. Balester was converted a relief pitcher the following season, in 2010, after struggling with Syracuse at the beginning of the year. In both 2010 and 2011, he would continue to split time between Syracuse and Washington before being designated for assignment in July 2011, before getting recalled a month later. The Nationals traded Balester to Detroit on December 9, 2011, for pitcher Ryan Perry. Professional career =Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals= Balester was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the fourth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft out of Huntington Beach High School. He was one of two high school players selected by the Expos in the 2004 Draft, with shortstop Ian Desmond being the other. After the draft, the Expos revealed that they hoped Balester could develop into a starting pitcher that would be in their rotation in three to five seasons. On July 10, Balester signed with the Expos and was assigned to the Rookie-level GCL Expos. In five games, he had a 1‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record, a 2.19 ERA and a 1.014 WHIP. Before the 2005 season, the Expos relocated to Washington and became the Washington Nationals. Baseball America also named Balester the 10th best prospect in the Nationals organization and listed him as having the best fastball of any minor leaguer in their system, which could be thrown at a maximum of 95 miles per hour. To begin the season, Balester joined the Class-A Savannah Sand Gnats and made his debut for the club on April 11, giving up just three hits in six innings and being awarded with the win. In a start against the Greensboro Grasshoppers on July 10, Balester allowed just one hit in eight innings of work, prompting Greensboro News & Record columnist Bill Hass to claim that, \\"The young right- hander [Balester] turned the Hoppers hitters into traffic cones.\\" On July 29, Baseball America mentioned Balester as a breakout player, along with infielder Kory Casto. In 24 games for Savannah, 23 of which were starts, he went 8‚Äì6 with a 3.67 ERA, and a 1.176 WHIP. After the season, Baseball America listed Balester as the second-best prospect in the Nationals system, behind third baseman Ryan Zimmerman. Balester began the 2006 season with the High-A Potomac Nationals, where he got off to a bad start, going 1‚Äì3 with a 6.91 in nine starts. On the bad start, Balester said, \\"It kind of has been hard. I did so well last year. I think it's going to be good for me that I am failing a little bit more so that I know how to fail. I know I can use this in the future.\\" He also added that, \\"I get way too high expectations for myself and I've got to realize I am only 19 years old.\\" In late August, after going 4‚Äì5 with a 5.20 ERA and a 1.521 WHIP in 22 starts for Potomac, Balester was called up to Double-A Harrisburg. According to the Washington Times, Balester had already booked a flight home to Huntington Beach, expecting to not receive a call-up to Double-A. In three starts for Harrisburg, he went 1‚Äì0 with a 1.83 ERA. In 2007, he was named the top prospect in the entire Nationals organization. Balester started the season with Harrisburg, where he finished the previous year. On July 7, Balester was named to the Team USA roster for the All-Star Futures Game at AT&T; Park. A week after being named to the Futures Game roster, Balester was called up to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers. In 17 starts for Harrisburg, he went 2‚Äì7 with a 3.74 ERA and then in 10 starts for the Clippers, he went 2‚Äì3 with a 4.18 ERA. After the season, there were rumors that the Nationals could trade him to the Tampa Bay Rays, in exchange for outfielder Elijah Dukes. Balester began the 2008 season with Columbus, going 9‚Äì3 with a 4.00 ERA in 15 starts for the club. He was called up from Triple-A Columbus on June 30, and made his debut the following day against the Florida Marlins. He pitched five innings, striking out three, and allowing one hit in a 9‚Äì6 Nationals win. With the win, he became the first Nationals starter to win his debut since Dan Smith did in 1999, when the team was still playing in Montreal. He started 14 more games for the Nationals, going 3‚Äì7 with a 5.51 ERA. In spring training 2009, Balester was part of a battle with Jordan Zimmermann and Shairon Martis for the final two spots in the Nationals rotation. However, he eventually lost the battle and was optioned to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs to begin the season. During Spring training, he went 1‚Äì1 with a 6.75 ERA, prompting Nationals manager Manny Acta to state that, \\"We need Collin to go down there and get some consistency on his command and three pitches. He took the news very well. He is going to go down there and work hard. I'm sure we are going to be seeing him this year and for years to come.\\" On July 23, after Zimmermann was placed on the 15-day disabled list, Balester was called up to take his place in the rotation. On August 25, the Nationals signed Liv√°n Hern√°ndez from free agency and to make room on the roster, optioned Balester to Triple-A. In seven starts for the Nationals in 2009, he went 1‚Äì4 with a 6.82 ERA. While with Syracuse, Balester strained a muscle on his left side, which ended his season. In 20 total starts with the Chiefs, he went 7‚Äì10 with a 4.44 ERA. On March 15, 2010, Balester was sent to minor league training camp, ensuring that he would start the 2010 season in Syracuse. To start the season, Balester recorded an 11.65 ERA in five starts for the Chiefs, prompting the Nationals to send him to extended spring training in order for him to convert to being a relief pitcher. On July 24, Balester was called up by the Nationals to replace Luis Atilano, who had been placed on the disabled list. That day, he came into the game to replace J. D. Martin and hit Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks in the head with a fastball. However, Weeks played the following day. Nine days later, Balester again hit a batter in the head, this time it was Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman Mark Reynolds. Much like Weeks, Reynolds was fine, but Balester still commented that, \\"You don't want to do that kind of stuff. It's the second time I did that, but it's one of those things you never want to have happen in your career. It's obviously unintentional. It's not a good situation to be in.\\" On August 8, Balester was optioned back to Syracuse, only to be recalled on August 24, when Stephen Strasburg was placed on the disabled list. However, a day later, he was sent back down to Triple-A. Balester was recalled again for a third time on September 5. In 35 total games for Syracuse, he went 3‚Äì3 with a 5.87 ERA, while in 17 games for Washington, he went 0‚Äì1 with a 2.57 ERA. In 2011, Balester was optioned again to Triple-A Syracuse to begin the season. On April 17, after throwing five scoreless innings for the Chiefs to begin the season, he was called up to replace Todd Coffey, who had been placed on the disabled list. He was optioned back to Syracuse on April 24, after making two appearances, allowing three runs. After Tom Gorzelanny was placed on the disabled list on May 28, Balester was recalled by the Nationals. At the time of his call-up, he had made 13 appearances with a 3.71 ERA and struck out 18 batters for Syracuse. He spent just one day with Washington as he was optioned back to Triple-A the next day without making an appearance, however, he was recalled again on June 15. He was designated for assignment on July 5. In eight games with the Nationals, he had a 4.61 ERA and a 1.683 WHIP. He was re- added to the 40-man roster on July 7, after the Nationals secured optional waivers for him, meaning they could take him off waivers, should a team try to claim him. On August 2, he was recalled by the Nationals, replacing Atahualpa Severino on the 25-man roster. =Detroit Tigers= On December 9, 2011, Washington traded Balester to the Detroit Tigers for Ryan Perry. In 2012, Balester was on the opening roster for the Tigers for the first time in his career. However, he was designated for assignment by Detroit on May 23. He was granted free agency on November 2. =Texas Rangers= Balester signed with the Texas Rangers on November 28. He was assigned to the Triple-A Round Rock Express to begin the 2013 season. He pitched in the rotation in April but after a start on April 30, he was placed on the disabled list the next day with an elbow issue. On June 6, Balester underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his season and delaying his start to 2014. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Balester signed a minor league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates on November 20, 2013. =Cincinnati Reds= Balester was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on June 19, 2015. On August 23, 2015, Balester was promoted to the Reds. He elected free agency on November 4. =Samsung Lions= On December 18, 2015, Balester was signed by the Samsung Lions of the KBO League.

The name Nehaj comes from the Croatian term Ne hajati , which means Don't care. In the Croatian language this fortress has also other names, which are: Kula Nehaj , what means Nehaj Tower, and Nehajgrad , what means Nehajtown. This name was given to the hill and the Fortress by the Uskoks, who built on the top of this hill the Fortress for defensive purposes. They gave the hill and the Fortress such a name because they wanted to emphasize to the citizens of the town of Senj, and all of those that lived in the vicinity of the town of Senj that they should not care that someone will conquer this hill or the Fortress until they are there. It was built by Croatian army general Ivan Lenkoviƒá, a captain of the Uskoks, on the hill Nehaj.Bousfield (2003), p. 227.Senj culturenet.hr Finished in 1558, it was built on the remains of ruined churches, monasteries and houses which were situated outside of the walls of Senj. These buildings were scrapped since it was concluded that they would not survive anyway if they were outside the city walls, as the Ottomans would loot them or use them as housing during sieges. The fortress was mainly built to fight the Ottoman Empire, and to be used as a base for the Uskoks. The Uskoks (who built and inhabited the fort) were great enemies of the Ottomans, as they had previously taken another city called Klis, where the Uskoks used to reside. Before the fortress was built, Senj had been besieged three times, but none succeeded; after the fort was built, the fortress or Senj were not attacked again. However, the Uskoks were also known to be the enemies of the Venetians, as the Venetians were quite aggressive toward the Croatian coastal cities. The Venetians viewed them as pirates, since they would plunder and sink their ships. They were known to travel as far as Istria and plunder Venetian ships. In fact, the Venetians were so disturbed by the Uskok attacks that they had a war with Austria (which Senj was a part of at that time). One of the peace terms was the banishment of the Uskoks. The Emperor did banish the Uskoks and that was their end. However, during the hundred years that they were active they stood by their oath of vengeance towards all their enemies which they took when their former fortress of Klis was conquered by the Ottomans in 1537. The Uskoks and the Fortress successfully held the border and kept invaders away, as the fortress was never conquered or torn down. In 1592, a strong Ottoman army invaded Croatia hoping to capture Senj. Led by Telli Hasan Pasha, the beylerbey of Bosnia, the Ottomans managed to capture a number of Uskok settlements, killing and enslaving the population. However, the army was routed and dispersed in the following year. Austria was involved in war with the Ottomans and the Venetian admiral Giovanni Bembo blockaded Trieste and Rijeka (Fiume), where the pirates forwarded their booty for sale. They also erected two forts to command the passages from Senj to the open sea. In 1600, the Prince of Senj was Mickael Radic. The Duke Micheal Radic, appointed as Prince of Senj on 1 December 1600 by King Rudolf in Graz. Prince Radic was Prince of Senj. Radic family is a Native noble family from Lika region; members of the family were Uskok military leaders at the headquarters in Senj. The fortress is tall and wide, and square shaped with walls averaging from in thickness. There are five towers on top of the Fortress, and eleven large cannon openings along the walls. Inside the Fortress, there are displays of cannons and other household items, as well as a collection of costumes and weapons of the Uskoks of Senj. There is also an annual medieval festival that is held in Senj, and an important part of it is when the \\"Uskoks\\" march up to the fortress on horseback. There are also crafting workshops and other medieval themed attractions around the fortress at this time; as well as a detailed overview of its history. Today, the fortress serves primarily as a museum. With exhibits of weapons, clothing, drawings and models of various things from the time when the fortress was actively used. Virtually all regions of the fort are accessible. Including the toilet which dangles over the edge, but that is not available for use today.

Nehaj is the name of the hill that is found above the center of the town of Senj in Croatia. More famous is the Nehaj Fortress that stands on top of the hill. The name Nehaj comes from the Croatian term Ne hajati which means Don't care. This name was given to the hill and the Fortress by the Uskoks, who built on the top of this hill the Fortress Nehaj for defensive purposes. They gave the hill and the Fortress such a name because they wanted to emphasize to the citizens of Senj, and to all of those who lived in the vicinity of the town, that they should not concern themselves with the security of the fortress, because it shall not fall as long as the Uskoks are there. This became true, because as long as the Uskoks were upon the hill, not one aggressor succeeded to conquer the hill or the Fortress, which at the same time meant great security for the town of Senj, which is located at the foot of the hill. To the builders of this Fortress, the only and main goal was the defence of the town and the obstruction of the Venetians and the Turks in their invasions and conquests. But, shortly after the Fortress was built on the top of the hill, a truce was made between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice, and one of the conditions of the truce was the transmigration of the Uskoks from the Fortress Nehaj and from Senj because of the constant fear that they gave the Venetians and the Turks. This act meant the disappearance of the Uskoks from the historical stage, and the exposure of these parts to constant conquests and plundering raids of the Turks and the Venetians.

Strasser took control of the government, deposing President Joseph Saidu Momoh.  Background  Sierra Leone had been governed since 1968 by the All People's Congress, which, after a constitutional referendum in 1978 suspected of being rigged, had become the sole legal party. Corruption and mismanagement had run rampant, both under Momoh and his predecessor, Siaka Stevens. In March 1991, the country was plunged into the Sierra Leone Civil War, pitting the government against the invading Revolutionary United Front, under the command of Foday Sankoh. Front- line government soldiers were poorly supplied and fed, and some complained they had not been paid for three months. Captain Strasser witnessed the deplorable conditions firsthand, being assigned to a unit fighting the rebels. When he received a shrapnel wound, he became disgruntled when he found he could not be evacuated. The coup Strasser and other junior officers organised a coup. They took a convoy to Freetown, the capital, and seized the State House, where Momoh's office was located, though Momoh had not yet arrived. The State House was briefly recovered by loyal troops, but soon fell back into the mutineers' hands. When Momoh was found, he was sent into exile by helicopter to Guinea. Results Joseph Opala, an American historian who had spent much of his adult life in the country, was rounded up and dispatched to the American ambassador to see if the US government would recognise the new regime. African-American ambassador Johnny Young stated that, while it was not generally done, an exception would be made in this case because the previous government had not been democratically elected and also because of the desperate state of the country. Banning all political parties, the National Provisional Ruling Council was formed as the new government. Parliament was dissolved.

Played by actor Charlie Sheen, the character has garnered him four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and two Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series. Although the character was written off after the end of the eighth season, the character was reprised for one episode of the ninth season by Kathy Bates, which resulted in her winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and in the series finale, \\"Of Course He's Dead\\". After being expelled from Juilliard School, Charlie moved back to Los Angeles with the intention of becoming a film composer. He met a commercial producer who listened to Charlie's work and thus, Charlie began his career writing jingles. His most famous composition is the Maple Loops song. Charlie then became a successful composer and singer of children's music, with the alias \\"Charlie Waffles\\", when the jingle business dried up. He can be frequently seen playing the Steinway grand piano in his living room. The piano was later removed from the house by Walden Schmidt after his death. The character of Charlie Harper is loosely based on Sheen himself. Charlie prides himself on his bachelor/playboy lifestyle in Malibu, California and drives a Mercedes, and used to own a Jaguar. He was also thinking of buying a Ferrari F430, or a Bentley. His lifestyle consists of living in a two-story beachfront home, drinking excessively, smoking cigars, taking drugs, constant womanizing, gambling, and usually wearing bowling shirts and shorts. Charlie sleeps in constantly, and retains a full-time housekeeper, Berta. Money \\"falls into his lap\\" as he lives a life of free-spirited debauchery. He has a vast range of phobias including stage fright (unless he is drunk), commitment, his mother, spiders, large birds, germs, change and hard work. Following Sheen's dismissal from the series in March 2011, the character was killed off in the ninth season, having supposedly been struck by a train while on vacation in Paris. Charlie's ghost, portrayed by Kathy Bates, returns as a hallucination to Alan, revealing that he is living in Hell trapped in a woman's body. This storyline is later retroactively changed by the series finale, \\"Of Course He's Dead,\\" in which his ex-girlfriend Rose reveals that Charlie is, in fact, alive (albeit brainwashed) and has been kept prisoner in the basement of a house that she purchased in Sherman Oaks after returning to the United States. He escapes from Rose's basement and returns to the beach house. As he rings the doorbell, a piano that is being transported by helicopter falls from the sky, killing him. History When Charlie's mother Evelyn was pregnant with him (for 7 and a half months), his parents thought that he was going to be a girl, since the ultrasound showed no signs of a penis. According to Evelyn, Charlie was always \\"a little drama queen\\" when he grew up. After his father died of food poisoning, Charlie and his brother Alan had three stepdads. The first, Harry Luther Gorsky, left Charlie's and Alan's mother for a young woman (Charlie refers to Harry as \\"a little tyrant\\"), and Evelyn was also present at his funeral, the second was a twitchy gay man from Texas who called him and Alan \\"buckaroos\\", and the third was \\"the Carpet King\\", a fat man whom Charlie liked the most because he had \\"a grateful daughter\\". Well into his 40s, Charlie believed \\"the Carpet King\\" owned a carpeting business until his mother explained that the man's name was actually sexual slang rather than his profession. When Charlie was young, he was embarrassed by his younger brother Alan, and when Alan had his first school day, Charlie told everyone at school that Alan was his shaved monkey (he later explained he did this because he always wanted a shaved monkey). He also gave his brother full-time wedgies and abused him whenever he could. Charlie has dependably had a stressed association with Alan, and would go to all expenses to escape being a decent sibling to him. As a child, Charlie would spook his sibling by giving him wedgies and ridiculing him at school. As a child, Charlie once put a toy in Alan's pocket to shop-lift, and when they got caught, he influenced Alan to assume the fault. Charlie drank a lot when he was a teenager, was a chain smoker, and constantly ran away, nevertheless his mother did not mind because he always came back, and generally didn't care about her sons. He once even, when he was 16, drove to Tijuana, Mexico with a school nurse. When he was 17, he almost married a woman whom he thought was the love of his life, but relented; as Charlie says, if he didn't, he would today be married to a \\"65-year old retired belly dancer\\". Charlie constantly criticizes Alan's and Jake's presence in his house, but generally seems comfortable that they are around, because they are the only people who have known him for a long time and remain in his daily life. When Alan was surprised to find Charlie did not have their mother's cell phone number in his contacts list, Charlie told him \\"If I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone.\\" On a later episode, it is shown Charlie does get his mother's number. In fact, he has it on the speed dial address that he finds appropriate for her, \\"666\\". Charlie and Alan have an estranged relationship with their mother and try to avoid her at all costs; Charlie refers to her as \\"a Satan\\". Not much is known about their biological father, Francis Harper, except that when Charlie thinks back he says he was a horrible son to him. Evelyn, even after multiple marriages, still keeps her first husband's name (Harper). Charlie also once had a hallucination of his father Francis telling him to take care of his mother, which horrified him, but when he saw an old gangster film, he realized that he \\"misunderstood\\" him, and to actually kill her when he is able to. Charlie is often uncaring towards Alan. In one episode he made Alan go on a date in spite of being sick with the flu, merely in order to afford him (Charlie) the opportunity to have \\"revenge sex\\". In another episode when Alan got frustrated in a bookstore and wanted to miss a movie that they were going to see Charlie replied, \\"So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a nervous breakdown. Don't you think that is a little selfish, Alan?\\" Furthermore, after Alan's second divorce Alan tells Charlie that he needs him in front of a crowd of people to which Charlie retorts, \\"Anyone know a Charlie?\\" He additionally derives enjoyment from rubbing his own success in Alan's face and further complicating Alan's situations just for the fun of it. He is particularly harsh about Alan's situation with Judith, especially since he told Alan not to marry her and tried to bribe him with a $1000 prostitute. While Charlie loves his nephew Jake and, at the beginning of the show, used him to get dates, he often makes jokes revolving around Jake's apparent lack of intellectual ability, and often states that he is destined to be a doorstop or a fry cook, and states that he is not a kid, but a \\"gassy dwarf\\". Nevertheless, it is often shown that Charlie genuinely loves Jake, and sometimes acts like a father to him, giving him some advice, that Alan is unable to give. Despite his selfish attitude, Charlie can be caring at times. Though Charlie often scolds Alan for being a \\"sponge\\", Charlie has continued to provide two out of his three bedrooms to Alan, without rent, and seemingly provides all of his meals, even when the two dine out together. In many occasions, he has stood up to Jake for Alan when Jake started roasting his father. He also cares a lot for Jake, even though he has trouble admitting it. In the episode \\"Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats\\" Jake gets an injury and Charlie goes out of his way to make sure that he's safe. In the episode \\"The Mooch at the Boo\\" Jake and his neighbor, a pretty girl named Celeste, disappear together and Celeste's father Jerome (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), an ex-football player, came looking. When they were found kissing, Charlie later said to Jerome that he would take the beating intended for Jake. Charlie watches a lot of sports on TV, but has little interest in athletics per se; rather, Charlie is a frequent gambler. He watches sports to keep tabs on his investments, and bets on horse races, football matches, etc. Two of his favorite sitcoms are Dharma and Greg and Becker. Despite his upper class and playboy persona, Charlie can be remarkably na√Øve about everyday matters. In \\"Last Chance to See Those Tattoos,\\" Alan observes that Charlie does not really understand how the Internet works. In \\"I Can't Afford Hyenas,\\" Charlie is shown to have no understanding of how to care for his own living expenses because he entrusts an accountant with managing his cash flow and paying the bills, but the accountant is actually swindling him. When his accountant is arrested, Charlie is not even aware of a problem until he receives notices from the bank that his accounts are delinquent, his credit cards are maxed out and his car is in danger of being repossessed. He has never done his own laundry, and has no idea how a washing machine works; he believes Alan when he sarcastically says that the machine will call him when the cycle is complete.Episode 4.10 \\"Kissing Abraham Lincoln\\" In the final few months of his life after Chelsea left him, he reverts to his old ways: drinking excessively, gambling, smoking marijuana to help him sleep and partying hard for hours. This began to affect him psychologically and physically; he aged considerably, gave himself a bad haircut, broke several toes and received a black eye from one of his adventures in Las Vegas. He eventually admits that his behavior is a way to cope with depression and loneliness. He is the only other character besides Alan to appear in every episode until his killing off. Reported death Charlie Harper was reported by Rose to have died in Paris after being struck by a train. The season 9 premiere featured his funeral with one of Charlie's trademark bowling shirts and a pair of cargo shorts hanging by his closed casket. Rose explained that he had proposed to her in Paris and the next few days had been happy, but when she returned from shopping one day, she found him showering with another woman. The next day he fell off a Paris M√©tro platform and was struck by a train, his body exploding \\"like a balloon full of meat\\". It is implied by Rose and suggested by Berta that Rose was responsible for Charlie's death. =Aftermath= Charlie's ghost (as portrayed by Kathy Bates) Following his death, Charlie has been frequently mentioned by his surviving (though very few) loved ones. It tends to be in a disrespectful manner and secrets and previously unknown details about his life emerge. After his funeral his ashes are delivered and Alan decides to spread them on the beach but spills them after being scared at seeing Walden Schmidt at the window, soaking wet. In \\"Those Fancy Japanese Toilets\\", Charlie is shown to have kept a private journal. He kept it in a safe deposit box at the bank, and after he died, the bank contacted his mother about it. She gives the journal to Alan, who becomes fascinated with it, as the entries give an insight to a whole new side of Charlie that he never saw before. It is revealed that Charlie had postulated about the various causes of his death, including liver failure and being pushed in front of a bus, and that he questioned his condescending behavior towards women. It's revealed that when Charlie first met his nephew Jake, he believed that he was to have a bright future ahead of him, but secretly thought he was not Alan's biological son (implied by him to Alan years prior). It is also hinted that, despite all the criticism and abuse, he actually idolized his brother and missed him when he moved in with Lyndsey, however he knew at the same time that he would be back \\"before long\\". In \\"Thank You for the Intercourse\\", Walden redecorates the house and therefore donates Charlie's piano to an orphanage. Alan suffers a mental breakdown, after realizing how much he misses Charlie and starts to act like him because of it, even picking up women with much success. Jake and Walden are worried about Alan's strange behavior and Walden then brings Alan to a mental institution after tricking him into believing that they were going for a trip to Las Vegas and that he stayed at the Bellagio penthouse suite. Charlie is re-introduced into the series in the episode \\"Why We Gave Up Women\\", portrayed by Kathy Bates. While Alan is hospitalized for a mild heart attack, he awakens to find a strange woman sitting at the foot of his bed, dressed like Charlie and smoking a cigar. She also introduces herself as Charlie. Still not convinced, Alan asks her questions that only the real Charlie could answer, and she does so correctly. Charlie proceeds to explain that he ended up in Hell, and, as part of his punishment, must live eternity in the body of a large, older woman, albeit with a pair of testicles (he does not consider his new form all bad, as he is able to grope his own breasts). Charlie advises Alan to turn his life around and become self-dependent for once. After the meeting, Alan decides to rent an apartment, which is very low-grade. The following night, Charlie reappears to Alan, and admits that he did not care if Alan changed, but was happy that even though he is dead, he was finally able to get him out of his house. Later, after Alan fakes a second heart attack, in the hospital, Charlie appears to Jake, trying to hint who he is after addressing him by his old pet name \\"Tater Head\\", but Jake fails to understand. Annoyed, Charlie goes back to Hell, escorted by two sexy women, where he wistfully complains about not having a penis any more. According to Chuck Lorre, the show's producers were so impressed with Bates performance, that they were considering bringing her back in the recurring role of \\"Alan's demonic spirit guide\\".TV Guide website Bates did not return to the show after this appearance. Charlie is mentioned briefly in the season 10 episode \\"A Big Bag of Dog\\", when Walden has an emotional breakdown upstairs in the master bedroom over a breakup, Berta says that Charlie used to have emotional meltdowns over breakups in that bedroom, too. He is mentioned in the season 10 episode \\"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\\" when Rose returns, Alan asks Walden if she told him that she was stalking his brother, and again when Rose is unsure whether to date Walden as he lives in Charlie's house, but Walden insists that has nothing to do with Alan or himself. He is referenced to by Walden in \\"Something My Gynecologist Said\\" when he is talking about this fake book he is writing, about a man called Alan who lives with his brother in a beach house, but the brother dies by being pushed in front of a train, and a billionaire comes and buys the house. Berta mentions him in \\"I Scream When I Pee\\", when saying that she didn't think she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but says that Walden is the greatest boss she ever had, after he comes to cheer her up on her birthday and buys her a car. Alan briefly mentions him in \\"Advantage: Fat, Flying Baby\\". He is mentioned again in the season 10 finale, \\"Cows, Prepare to Be Tipped\\", when Alan reveals that Charlie left Jake two of his last cigars for when Jake graduates college. Alan and Jake smoke them and laugh heartily. In \\"Big Episode. Someone Stole a Spoon\\", after a wild party at the beach house leaves an intense mess with wreckage, Walden come out into the living room and says, \\"It looks like Charlie Sheen's house!\\", referencing not the character, but the actor himself. =Daughter= In season 11, a woman knocks on Walden and Alan's door, and introduces herself as Jenny, Charlie's daughter, which surprises Alan to the point of shock, as he never knew that he had a daughter, but amuses Walden. According to Jenny, the last time she saw him alive was at her fourth birthday. Hurt because Charlie didn't want to marry her, Jenny's mother banned him from ever seeing Jenny again. Wanting to somehow provide for Jenny, Charlie would send a lucrative check to the family every month up until his passing. Alan reveals to Jenny that he kept his brother's ashes and put them in the liquor cabinet. He spills his ashes twice in the same day but is happy when he finds two quarters in them. It is also the first time Walden mentions Charlie by name, after previously only referring to him as \\"your brother\\" or \\"Alan's brother\\", and he wishes there was something other than Alan that Charlie would have left behind. Berta begins to tell Jenny stories of Charlie's life but Walden stops her and asks if she has any stories for Jenny that don't include drugs, alcohol or hookers, Berta is unable to recall any more stories than ones that include those things. Later at Pavlov's, Jenny, Walden, Alan and Evelyn toast to Charlie as a father, brother, son and guy who bought his beach house after got hit by a train In the second episode Evelyn says to her boyfriend that she wasn't the greatest mother to Charlie and Alan, and that she wants to make up for it with Jenny. She asks Jenny if she wants to see pictures of her father at the police station as they will have more pictures of him than she ever took. Walden talks to Charlie's ashes for the first time in season 11, asking him for a sign of advice on what to do about his love life and thanks him for the house, stating, \\"you'd have to be on crack to give all this up\\". Jenny claims that in her entire life, Charlie only wrote to her once asking \\"Are your friends 18 yet?\\" =Return= In the series finale, \\"Of Course He's Dead\\", a retcon reveals that Charlie is not dead but survived an attempt on his life by an angry Rose after she found him having sex with a hooker, a mime, and a goat on their honeymoon. Rose binds and gags him and returns Charlie to the United States where she brainwashes him and confines him to a pit under her house in Sherman Oaks. He escapes after four years, collects $2.5 million in royalty money, and sends messages to Alan, Evelyn, and Walden, warning of his imminent return and threatening revenge against them. He also sends Jenny, his former girlfriends, Berta, and Jake generous checks. In the last moments of the finale, Charlie is seen walking (only shown from the back) to the door of his beach house, when a helicopter is transporting Charlie's grand piano and just as he is about to ring the doorbell of the beach house, the piano drops and Charlie disappears once and for all. No one was particularly happy that Charlie was alive because he was planning to kill them, and because the characters had moved on with their lives and become a closer family unit than they had been when Charlie was alive and lived there. Despite speculation that Charlie Sheen would make a cameo appearance, he does not appear in the program. Instead, his character is depicted via animation as a re-enactment of events when Rose is explaining what happened in Paris and by a stand-in in the last scene which only shows Charlie from behind. According to showrunner Chuck Lorre, writing in the vanity card that appeared at the end of the episode, Sheen was offered a role in the finale where he would have \\"walk[ed] to the front door in the last scene, ring the doorbell, then turn, look directly into the camera and go off on a maniacal rant about the dangers of drug abuse. He would then explain that these dangers only applied to average people. That he was far from average. He was a ninja warrior from Mars. He was invincible. And then we would drop a piano on him. We thought it was funny. He didn‚Äôt. Instead, he wanted us to write a heart warming scene that would set up his return to primetime TV in a new sitcom called The Harpers starring him and Jon Cryer. We thought that was funny too.\\" Love life Charlie's love life is a recurring theme in his character. He is an alcoholic womanizer who has engaged in decades of frequent one-night stands, prostitutes, casual sex, and \\"relationships\\" of short duration, in stark contrast to his brother Alan's inability to garner much female attention. Even though Charlie usually never calls any of his partners again after he had sex with them, there are a few relationships on the show that lasted longer than one night, notably his neighbor Rose, who continues to stalk him after they spent one night together, and Jake's ballet teacher Mia, whom Charlie was actually in love with, and almost married in Las Vegas. He usually dated much younger women, but starting in season 5, he pursued relationships that were a change of pace for him. He started a relationship with a respected judge played by Ming-Na and later with a substantially older single mother/author (Susan Blakely), but he later blew it with both women. In season 6, Charlie proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea (Jennifer Taylor, who has also played three other roles in earlier seasons) just to get her to return his love for her. But eventually turns out that it was the only love of his life when he dumped Mia and confessed his love for Chelsea. They remain engaged throughout season 7 until Charlie throws up on a baby, forcing Chelsea to dump him and leaving Charlie heartbroken. At the end of season 8 he goes off with Rose to a romantic getaway in Paris, which ultimately resulted in his 'death'. Notable love interests (in order of appearance) =Rose= Charlie and Rose (Melanie Lynskey) spent one night together shortly before the events portrayed in the show; after this, Rose became increasingly obsessed with him. She usually spends time at his beach house when Charlie and Alan are gone, and when they come back they usually find a surprise, such as cabinets that are glued shut. Rose demonstrates her obsession with Charlie in numerous ways: when taking up with Charlie's pizza boy Gordon, she flaunted him to Charlie in an obvious but useless attempt to make the latter jealous; she then attempted to mold Gordon into Charlie by dressing him in short pants and designer bowling shirts like those Charlie usually wears, and instructing him to try to emulate Charlie's poses; she has named all of her five ferrets Charlie. Rose's father (portrayed by Sheen's real-life father Martin) became similarly obsessed with Charlie's mother Evelyn; Charlie and Evelyn sought \\"expert\\" assistance (i.e., Rose) to get rid of him. Charlie is usually charmed by Rose, but is not interested in a relationship with her, even though Berta thinks they are a good couple together. When Rose decided to leave to go to London Charlie believed that she was only pretending in order to get him into a relationship with her; after she really left, Charlie realized that he made a horrible mistake by letting Rose go. He then went to London to meet her but quickly returned home when Rose started talking about his moving there and starting a family together. Rose has since returned to Malibu and continues to stalk Charlie. As of \\"The Devil's Lube,\\" there is a chance of a future relationship between the two; in this episode Charlie points out that he has not seen Rose in a while, but she cannot say the same. In \\"Above Exalted Cyclops,\\" Rose, after being set up by Chelsea, now has moved on from Charlie and is stalking Alan, or possibly stalking both brothers. In \\"Gumby with a Pokey\\" (her only appearance in Season 7), she is still noted as Charlie's stalker, implying that she is either done stalking Alan and back to Charlie, or stalking both brothers. Gordon is unaware of Rose's brief relationship with Alan.When Charlie introduces Gordon to Alan's ex-wife's new husband Herb and Alan's girlfriend's ex-husband Chris in ep. 8.4 \\"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\\" Gordon claims that he has not had sex with anyone in Alan's life. In Season 8's \\"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\\" Rose is again stalking Charlie. This time it has become too much for Charlie's new girlfriend Michelle, who is convinced that Charlie loves Rose. Rose tells Charlie that she is marrying a guy named \\"Manfred Quinn,\\" which appears to be verified when Charlie and Alan go to the church and peer through a door window to see a wedding in progress. The two walk away, with Charlie confused and apparently heartbroken. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that, with the exception of the priest and Rose, all the other attendants are mannequins (hence the name of Rose's purported groom: Manfred \\"Manny\\" Quinn). Later in Season 8, Charlie tells Rose that he loves her and they begin a romantic relationship with Charlie even taking her on a romantic getaway to Paris despite the fact that he still thinks she is truly married. It is implied that Rose has something to do with Charlie's death in Paris after it is revealed she caught him having an affair. Charlie had proposed to her in Paris also which was mentioned by Rose at Charlie's funeral and Rose said yes to the proposal. In \\"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\\", Rose begins a relationship with Walden, and after \\"Ferrets, Attack!\\" begins stalking him and ruining his life. =Jill/Bill= Bill (Chris O'Donnell) was a previous girlfriend of Charlie's appearing in a season one episode, \\"An Old Flame with a New Wick\\". Bill had since had sexual-reassignment surgery and was formerly living as Jill. Charlie comments during the episode that while the relationship was passionate, sex with Bill was \\"a little weird\\". As the episode progresses, Bill begins dating Charlie's mother Evelyn (she is initially unaware of Bill's history). Once Bill's identity is revealed to her, she faints, but decides to continue seeing Bill. Bill was never seen or mentioned again. =Lisa= Lisa (Denise Richards) was Charlie's favorite ex- girlfriend. She appeared in one season 1 and one season 2 episode. In \\"Merry Thanksgiving,\\" Charlie proposed to her but she decided to marry another man. In \\"Yes, Monsignor,\\" Charlie had to prove that he is good with babies when he found out she had one (played by Richards' and Sheen's real-life first daughter Sam). Notably, she was absent at Charlie's funeral. =Delores Pasternak= Miss Delores Pasternak (Missi Pyle, also Alicia Witt in season 6) was Jake's fifth-grade teacher. Charlie charmed her to save Jake from suspension for flipping her off, but she proved to be a domineering/school- marm type, driving Charlie to break up with her, after which she had a meltdown that got her fired from teaching and disowned by her family, leaving her to become a bikini dancer. After running into each other four years later (see \\"A Jock Strap in Hell\\"), Charlie feels guilty about this and hires her as Jake's private tutor, leading them to resume their romantic relationship. She quickly reverts to her religious self and Charlie breaks up with her again. She was seen at Charlie's funeral, where she mentioned he made tea using her panties. =Isabella= Isabella (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) was Charlie's Goth girlfriend known to bring a dark atmosphere with her. She and several of her girlfriends \\"anoint\\" Charlie as their king in a ceremony, \\"bonding\\" them for life. It's revealed that she knows Evelyn from Pilates class, and Isabella was unaware that Charlie and Alan are Evelyn's sons. Isabella was at Charlie's funeral, where she mentions that Charlie gave her herpes. =Kandi= Charlie had a brief relationship with Kandi (April Bowlby, credited as \\"Kymber\\"), after which she married his brother, Alan. Kandi is depicted as hot and young (half the age of Alan or Charlie), with a \\"dumb blonde\\" stereotype, even though she is a redhead. =Mia= Mia (Emmanuelle Vaugier) is a ballet teacher, whom Charlie had a crush on, and was engaged to for a short while. Charlie decided not to marry Mia after she insisted that Alan and Jake must move out of the house, only to find out that Alan had married Kandi and moved out. Charlie later became sexually reckless and depressed, because he learned that Mia was going to marry someone else. Charlie blamed Alan for ruining everything, but later realizes that he was just looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. They reunited in person at the end of season 6's \\"Baseball Was Better With Steroids,\\" resulting in a cliffhanger for the season finale. In season 7's premiere \\"818-jklpuzo\\", Mia appears in much less favorable light. Mia asks Charlie for help with a singing career, but in reality she appears to want him back. By this time, Charlie had begun a relationship with Chelsea, and is now torn between the two. While in the studio recording a demo tape, Mia asks Charlie for sex after revealing that she is a horrible singer. Charlie tells Mia she cannot sing, and chooses Chelsea. As Charlie rushes away he turns off Mia's microphone, so that he cannot hear her yell and swear at him. Mia was at Charlie's funeral, demanding to see the body. =Lydia= Shortly after he cancelled his wedding with Mia, Charlie began dating a rude real-estate agent named Lydia (Katherine LaNasa). Alan, Jake, Rose and Berta did not like her and made this clear to Charlie, but when she met his mother, Evelyn, the four realised that she and Evelyn were exactly alike in character. Bobby, the waiter at Charlie's and Evelyn's favorite restaurant, was the first to recognise Lydia's similarity to Evelyn. When Lydia began bossing Berta around, Berta threatened to quit unless Charlie broke up with her. Lydia meanwhile threatened to break up with Charlie unless he fired Berta. In the end, Charlie broke up with Lydia, and Berta would only return if Charlie admitted his sexual addiction and attended rehab. At Charlie's funeral, Lydia mentions that Charlie loved being spanked. =Myra= Myra (Judy Greer) is the sister of Herb Melnick (Judith's husband after Alan). She bonded with Charlie over their hatred of Judith. Judith did not want the two dating, and would take her frustration out on Alan. Judith did not want Charlie coming over to her house either, so Charlie invited Myra to his house. Even though she was supposed to be sleeping in Jake's room, Myra slept with Charlie, leaving Alan and Jake to hear them and find out the truth. When Charlie wanted to pursue the relationship, he was heartbroken to learn that she was engaged and he'd have to drive her to the airport after the wedding, and that he'd never see her again. Greer again appears in Season 9 as Walden's ex-wife. =Linda Harris= At the beginning of the fifth season, Charlie dated Judge Linda Harris (Ming-Na), a judge of his own age. Their relationship ended in the middle of the same season, after Linda concluded that she couldn't \\"be connected publicly to a guy like [Charlie]\\" after he publicly humiliated her (under the influence of his mother's \\"medication\\") at an event held in her honor. The random songs which Charlie sang to her son Brandon while babysitting, essentially launched his show-biz persona, \\"Charlie Waffles\\". =Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman= Charlie also fell for his future stepsister, \\"Courtney\\" (Jenny McCarthy) in Season 5, and after agreeing to stop seeing her due to their relationship to each other, he lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes moments before they become step- siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart- broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia, but he apparently retains feelings for her, telling her that he will \\"wait\\" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's \\"Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\\" (as Courtney) after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her.\\"Two and a Half Men Review: Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\\". Article at TVFanatic.com TV Fanatic Courtney and Charlie break up two episodes later in \\"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead\\" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. Although surprisingly she holds a lot of resentment towards him at his funeral in the season 9 opener. In the season 9 episode \\"Nine Magic Fingers\\", Courtney starts dating Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget, Walden's wife, successfully convince Walden that Courtney is simply a con artist. =Angie= Near the end of season 5, Charlie met an older woman (Susan Blakely) named Angie who was also the author of a relationship self-help book that he was interested in reading. Angie has been described as a mother figure to Charlie, more so than even his own mother, Evelyn. When Angie introduced him to her grown son Jeremy and his fianc√©e Tricia (Virginia Williams), Charlie realized that he had dated Tricia earlier in his life. After Tricia revealed that she still had feelings for Charlie, Tricia dumped Jeremy, and Angie became, as Alan describes, a \\"mean drunk\\" who verbally lashed out at Charlie and furiously broke up with him. =Melissa= In a season 6 episode (\\"The Flavin' and the Mavin'\\"), Charlie is annoyed that he has to drive Alan to work, until he meets Alan's spunky young receptionist, Melissa (Kelly Stables). Alan begs Charlie not to hit on her, as it will likely end badly and complicate their working relationship, but Charlie ignores him. Charlie sleeps with Melissa, then becomes annoyed when she constantly hangs around his house. Melissa becomes vindictive when she realizes that Charlie is not serious about their relationship. As Alan suspected, the failed relationship causes Melissa to demand a raise and health insurance. (Melissa would later date Alan in several episodes of seasons 6, 7 and 8, becoming the third of Charlie's ex-girlfriends to later date Alan.) =Chelsea= Chelsea Christine Melini (Jennifer Taylor) starts dating Charlie in season 6, and is the first woman to whom he confessed his love without prompting. He says this nearly by accident, but claims he meant it. At first, Chelsea was another one of Charlie's one-night stands, but it soon evolved into a relationship. The relationship comes to a rut with Chelsea wanting to break up, but after some couples counseling, the two remained together. Charlie proposed to her, ring and all, just to get her to say \\"I love you\\" back to him, and until the middle of season 7, they were engaged to be married. When Chelsea moved into the Harper beach house, Charlie rented out her vacant apartment to get alone time. Chelsea has a cat named \\"Sir Lancelot\\", who was almost never seen on-camera (two exceptions are in \\"Mmm, fish. Yum.\\" and \\"Tinkle Like a Princess\\") and was constantly being stepped on, mostly by Charlie, but once by Alan. Chelsea got along well with Evelyn, much to Charlie's chagrin, and had a very rocky relationship with her nephew-to-be Jake, until Charlie forced them to work out their issues. Charlie had a telephone video of one of their lovemaking events, but when Chelsea found out, she erased the video herself. The two eventually broke up due to Charlie's jealousy towards her friendship with Alan's lawyer, Brad. Charlie then made matters worse by vomiting on a baby in public while apologizing to her, and subsequently slept with Chelsea's best friend, Gail (Tricia Helfer). Chelsea's last appearance was in the first episode of Season 9, when she announced at Charlie's funeral that he gave her chlamydia; Gail, who also attended, said Charlie gave her vaginal warts. =Betsy= Betsy (Katy Mixon) first met the Harper brothers the day Charlie and Chelsea set the date for their wedding. Panicked over the impending end of his bachelor lifestyle, Charlie finds himself blacked out drunk in bed with Betsy and Alan shortly after their meeting in Pavlov's Bar. With little memory of the night's events, Alan and Charlie left her home before dawn. Only remembering flashes of himself, his brother, and Betsy fooling around naked, shortly after Alan performed a striptease in drag, Charlie went to his mother for advice. To help wipe the disturbing memories from Charlie's mind, Evelyn told him of the time she cheated on her third husband with circus folk, including a clown, strongman, bearded lady, acrobats, and dwarfs, in one debased night. Traumatized by Evelyn's story, Charlie's few memories of the night were now replaced with images of his mother's circus orgy. When Charlie and Betsy encounter each other again, they immediately run off to Las Vegas and have a \\"quickie\\" wedding. But the marriage is soon rendered invalid when it is revealed that Betsy is already married. =Michelle= Michelle (Liz Vassey) is Charlie's dermatologist. In \\"Twanging Your Magic Clanger,\\" they met when Charlie was getting a mole removed from his behind. They went to a movie and Charlie was surprised to learn that she is older than he is. After Alan telling him that he's probably gonna be dead for ten years by the time she turns 70 (which ironically came true, as he died not too long after), he went to Michelle and told her that he was interested in being in a relationship with her. He then met Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, which led him to briefly think about sex with the daughter. But after finding out that she thinks \\"older guys\\" (much younger than Charlie) are bad to have sex with, he returns to Michelle. In \\"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\\" Michelle and Charlie went on a date where they had lunch with Evelyn and Alan, causing a few embarrassing details about Charlie's past to slip out. When they got to Charlie's house, Charlie introduced Michelle to Berta and told Michelle about his past girlfriends and other sordid details of his life. To Charlie's surprise, Michelle still wanted to be with him. Later that night, Charlie's neighbor/stalker Rose appeared on his deck. Michelle was upset with Charlie, because he did not mention Rose in any of his confessions. Nor did he mention the fact that she constantly stalked him. The next week, Charlie went to Michelle's house with flowers and begged her to give him another chance. Michelle broke up with Charlie anyway, convinced that he still had feelings for Rose. At Charlie's funeral, Michelle builds on Lydia's remark about him by adding that he liked being spanked while wearing Michelle's panties. ;Notes References External links * Small list of Charlie's famous girlfriends * TV week article * Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Subjects, Themes and Settings (McFarland & Co., 2007), , 978-0-7864-2498-6, found at Google Books from the University of Michigan * Daily News article * Comedic \\"Funeral\\" Event for Charlie held on September 18, 2011 * John Kenneth Muir, TV Year: The Prime Time 2005‚Äì2006 Season (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007) , 978-1-55783-684-7 * Stephen F.

Lasselle (Knox Co. Court Record #2490 [90-146-32] and #2890-2) was an 1820 Indiana Supreme Court case where abolitionists attempted to free a slave from her master. The case resulted in the court ordering all slaves held within Indiana to be freed. Background Slavery had been a legal institution in the region of Indiana when it was controlled by France and Great Britain, and remained legal until 1787 when the Northwest Territory was organized by the United States of America. The Northwest Ordinance prohibited further expansion of slavery in the region, but allowed for the continuation of existing slave arrangements. When the Indiana territory was established in 1800, many slaveholders immigrated to the territory bringing their slaves with them. The territory passed legislation that allowed for the slaves to be indentured within the territory. This law allowed slaveholders to continue in their ownership of slaves that were purchased outside of the state, even if the slaves came to reside in Indiana.Dunn, p. 346 When Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the constitution instituted a ban on slavery. This ban brought the previous laws that had permitted slavery into conflict, and the issues of whether preexisting slave arrangements were still legal was brought before the courts on several occasions. Each time the circuit courts had denied or approved the freedom of the slaves on an individual basis. Case In 1819 two abolitionists, John Osborn and Amory Kinney, sought the aid of a Vincennes law office to test the legality of slave arrangements made prior to 1816. The two were Canadians who had immigrated to Indiana after the War of 1812. They believed that the constitutional ban on slavery extended to all slaves, including those held before 1816. The lawyers at the office, Colonel George McDonald and Moses Tabbs, also members of the anti-slavery party, began to prepare a test case to bring before the courts.Dunn, 347 To ensure their case would have the widest reaching effects, they chose to attempt to free a slave named Polly who belonged to Hyacinthe Lassalle of Vincennes. The Lassalles were among the oldest family of immigrants in the state and had been in the region since France had owned it in the 18th century. Lassalle's father was a French trader who settled near Fort Wayne around 1765 where he married a Miami woman, and John was born to the couple in 1777. Polly had been purchased before the Northwest Territory had been established, and if she could be freed then a precedent would be set whereby all other slaves in the state could also be set free. The defense of Lassalle was performed by Judge Jacob Call, a future Congressman. The case was first submitted to the circuit court in Vincennes where it was ruled that Polly should remain a slave. The court cited the fact that Polly was owned before the Northwest Ordinance was passed, and the wording of the Virginia Deed of Cession as proof, claiming that Lassalle's ownership of Polly was protected by federal law. In June 1820 the case was appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court. Chief Justice Isaac Blackford was the son-in-law of McDonald, one of the plaintiff's lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyers argued that the constitution superseded all other laws, including one written prior to the constitution's adoption, and that the Northwest Ordinance ceased to apply to Indiana after statehood. The defense argued that the Northwest Ordinance, a federal law, superseded the state constitution and that it could have been repealed only by the federal government but was not repealed, it was still in effect regardless of Indiana's status in the Union. The court decided in favor of Polly and in the July decision court stated that > ...the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition > of slavery in this state. ...it follows, as an irresistible conclusion, > that, under our present form of government, that slavery can have no > existence in the State of Indiana, and, of course, that the claim of the > said Lasselle cannot be supported. Decision The decision was a major victory for the abolitionists in the state who had organized to ban slavery only seventeen years earlier.Dunn, p. 253 The result was that not just Polly but also all other slaves, including those held prior to Indiana statehood, were freed. There was some anger among the slaveholding community and violence was threatened against Osborn and Kinney, but no action was taken against them. The case also led to the impeachment of the Clark County Justice of the Peace for aiding slaveholders who refused to free their slaves. Many slaveholders, not wanting to lose their valuable slaves, left the state before their slaves could be taken from them.Dunn, p. 348 The 1820 US census revealed that there were 190 slaves in Indiana and 1,200 free blacks, many of whom had been freed by the decision. The number of slaves dropped off dramatically and there were only three slaves in the state in both the 1830 and 1840 censuses.

Licensed to Salina, Kansas, United States, it serves the Salina-Manhattan area. The station is currently owned by Rocking M Media, LLC. History =Early legends= Salina's most enduring radio station, KSAL was originally KSJS - the \\"SJ\\" standing for Salina Journal, its parent company. Its first owner was R.J. Laubengayer, who not only was president of the Salina Journal and KSAL, but director of Consolidated Printing and Farmers National Bank in Salina. The station went on the air in June 1937 at studios in the former Salina Journal building at the southwest corner of Seventh and Iron (today it's a parking lot). It was in that building that local radio personality Ken Jennison started his professional radio career (after 4 years at Kansas State University) in 1949. He began as a copywriter, putting together daily \\"logbooks\\" that tracked each day's broadcast from the moment the station went on the air at 6 a.m. to when it signed off with the \\"Star- Spangled Banner\\" at midnight (24-hour radio was in the future). \\"Everything was written down -- programs, commercials, introductions, music selection -- everything was in that book,\\" Jennison said. \\"It would be given to the announcer, and he would follow it exactly. If you had a news break at 3 p.m., you had to time it out right.\\" =Evolution= In the early 1960s, tape was introduced. Announcements and commercials would be prerecorded on cassette tapes, Jennison said, and that took some of the pressure off disc jockeys. Live music also was a staple in the early days of radio. A popular program of the 1960s was the Sonny Slater show, which featured musicians playing live at the studio at noon on Saturdays. Live music programs didn't last long on local radio. \\"It was difficult to fill up a program with live music all the time,\\" Jennison said. KSAL switched to news-talk in April 1996. During the mid-80's it was the only radio station in the area that had their own color weather radar that could actually predict when thunderstorms were entering a certain area. =Today= Today, KSAL continues to be the area's only 24-hour staffed newsroom. They feature local morning, afternoon and weekend programing. Program Director Rich Alexander has organized a team of meteorologists who provide weather coverage on the station. KSAL is also very involved in local and regional sports. In addition to area high school sports coverage, they are the Kansas State University sports & Kansas City Royals baseball affiliate for the Salina area. Ken Jennison, who celebrates his 83rd birthday in 2010, continues to work at KSAL as their public service director. In 2012, KSAL celebrated its 75th anniversary of broadcasting to the Salina area.

He was best known for advancing psychoanalytic studies in Great Britain.  Education and medical training  Eder studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Following the completion of his studies, he travelled through the United States, South Africa and Bolivia, where he became a non- commissioned military surgeon for the Bolivian Army.International Journal of Psychoanalysis Eder returned to London in 1900 and went into general practice. His interest in paediatric medicine led to his appointment as Medical Officer of the London School Clinic in 1908 and of the Nursery School at Deptford in 1910. He was also the editor of the medical journal School Hygiene. In the First World War, Eder joined the British Army, serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps. As a temporary captain, he was appointed medical officer in charge of the psycho-neurological department in Malta. He would later recall the physical and mental injuries suffered by the frontline troops in his 1917 book War-Shock, The Psycho-neuroses in War: Psychology and Treatment.Journal of Mental ScienceS.

Accessed 1 July 2008 Psychoanalysis  David Eder in 1893 During the early 1910s, Eder became interested in the psychoanalytical theories emerging from Europe. Writing as M. D. Eder, he provided English- language translation for works by Carl Jung (Diagnostic Association Studies and The Theory of Psychoanalysis) and Sigmund Freud (Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners and On Dreams). Eder would later prefer the Freudian approach to the Jungian approach.International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis Eder also authored original articles on psychoanalysis. His influence stretched beyond medical circles: the novelist D. H. Lawrence alluded to Eder's pamphlet The State Endowment of Motherhood in the book The White Peacock.  Major studies  In 1932 he was elected president of the medical section of the British Psychological Society. That year, he presented his 1932 study The Management of the Nervous Patient. First presented at the London Jewish Hospital Medical Society, the paper called for the combination of psychoanalysis into the process of medical diagnosis. \\"When this is not feasible,\\" he said, \\"the physician's intelligence...must be employed to guide his patient to a measure of mental wholeness.\\"'The Management of the Nervous Patient.' The Medical Forum, 1932, vol. I, p. 18. Also in 1932, Eder presented his concept of the Myth of Progress. Writing in the British Journal of Medical Psychology, Eder argued that while civilization is moving forward due to advances in science, politics and technology, these advances are actually contributing to greater unhappiness as man perceives a loss of control over his environment. 'The Myth of Progress.' The British Journal of Medical Psychology, 1932, Vol. XII, p. 1.  Politics  Outside of his medical work, Eder was active in Britain's Socialist politics and was involved in the Fabian Society, the leading British socialist organisation. As a supporter of the Zionist cause, Eder served on the Zionist Executive in Palestine from 1921 to 1927, and was later president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain. Eder was opposed to dividing Palestine into two states, and was quoted as saying: \\"There can be only one national home in Palestine, and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between Jews and Arabs.\\"Media Monitors Network References External links * Category:1865 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Jewish British scientists Category:Psychology writers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British Zionists Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:Bolivian military personnel Category:Jewish military doctors Category:British psychologists Category:British psychoanalysts Category:Jewish psychoanalysts Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:History of psychiatry Category:Analysands of S√°ndor Ferenczi Category:Analysands of Ernest Jones Category:Analysands of Victor Tausk Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud Category:Translators of Sigmund Freud ","title":"David Eder"},{"id":"18227509","text":"Carel Theodorus Scharten (March 14, 1878 - October 31, 1950) was a Dutch poet.

Formation After the 1940‚Äì1944 insurgency in Chechnya, the Soviet government deported the entire Chechen and Ingush population. The vacated Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, and its territory partitioned, with the southern mountainous region being joined to the Georgian SSR, the western Ingush populated area to the North Ossetian ASSR, and the eastern strip of like size to the Dagestan ASSR. The resulting territory was joined with vast Kizlyarsky District and with Naursky District of Stavropol Krai. Most of the territory in the north was mixed Nogay and ethnic Russian (Terek Cossack), although southern areas did include excessive ethnic Chechen land, that was now vacated. This was settled mostly by refugees from the western regions of the USSR who fled the Nazi German invasion and occupation. By the mid-1950s economically the region became profitable. Abolishment and consenquences In 1956, however, the Soviet government issued a new decree on re-habilitation of the repressed peoples. Several thousand Chechens and Ingush took this chance to move back to their ancestral home. This was met with mixed signals, on one hand this allowed for a very potential workforce, on the other question arose of re-establishment of the ChIASSR and a full re-habilitation of the Chechens and Ingush people. The latter created several problems as most of their homes were now occupied by re-settlers. Nonetheless, in January 1957 the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR re-instated the ChIASSR and abolished Grozny Oblast. However, the pre-1944 borders were not preserved. Kizlyarsky District was passed to the Dagestan ASSR (which administered it during 1923‚Äì1937) and two left-bank Terek River districts (Naursky and Shelkovsky) adjacent to Chechnya were retained by the ChIASSR. This was done for two reasons, primarily due to the firm economic ties they developed to Grozny, but also to dilute the new republic's ethnic composition, as they became the central settlement zones for the returning Chechens (to avoid them being re-settled into the mountainous zones). Upon return, the deported peoples were met negatively by the region's still pre-dominant Russian population, especially in the feuds over land and homes. This erupted in the August 1958 riots where the Russians demanded that either the Grozny Oblast be restored or the ChIASSR be transformed into a republic with no titular nation like neighbouring Dagestan. The riot was put down by the Soviet militsiya. As a result of this, by the mid-1970s a systematic emigration of Russians from the republic started, due to the social discirimation in favour of the only nationality (all administrative roles of Checheno-Ingushetia by the late 1970s were held by Chechens).Apn.ru Predchustviye Grazhdanskoy Voyiny by Sergey Markedonov. 7 August 2007. Retrieved 3 November 2008 By the end of the 1980s, Chechens formed the majority in all mountainous regions, and almost half of the population in traditional ethnic Russian/Cossack regions (left banks of the Terek and Sunzha Rivers, cities of Grozny and Gudermes) the catalyst was set for the mass ethnic cleansing of the Russian population that took place in the 1990s.United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Russian Federation: Information On The Treatment Of Ethnic Russians In Chechnya And The Treatment Of Ethnic Russians Who Have Fled Chechnya And Are Attempting To Resettle In One Of The Larger Cities In The Russian Federation. , 5 August 1998.

She was a nominee for Britain‚Äôs Best Awards for Home Grown Talent and entered the professional Ladies European Tour after turning pro in 2008. Early years Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, to an English father and Mauritian mother, Zu√´l‚Äôs interest in golf first materialised at the age of nine, when she watched the Masters on television. Transfixed by the golf on display and, after watching Jos√© Mar√≠a Olaz√°bal triumph, Henni stated her intention to become a golfer. Upon receiving her first set of golf clubs, Zu√´l played whenever she had a spare moment. Often she practiced in her back garden, sometimes under floodlight, filming herself on camcorder to analyse and improve her game. Winning her first tournament, the T-peg junior golf competition in Dorset, confirmed that the practice was paying off. 1999‚Äì2008: amateur career By the time Zu√´l was 13, she had cut her handicap to two on the way to winning 17 Opens at Under-18 level, never finishing outside the top 10 in 50 other tournaments. Zu√´l was also personally selected by Nick Faldo as the youngest member of Team Faldo, which offered her the chance to play in such far flung places as the US and Asia. In 2003, Zu√´l became the Yeovil Ladies club Champion and England‚Äôs Under-13s champion. She also won the Dorset Ladies County Championship and joined the Ladies European Tour - the youngest player ever to do so - enabling her to play alongside Sophie Gustafson, Laura Davies, Paula Mart√≠ and Carin Koch. In 2004, Zu√´l won the Central European Under-16 Championship and the English Under-15 Championship on the way to winning the Welsh Ladies Open in 2005 at just 15 years old. Zu√´l also added the Welsh Ladies Golf Union Under-21 trophy to her growing list of championship wins. The same year at the Roehampton Gold Cup, a semi professional tournament featuring a field of 30 professionals, Zu√´l finished as the top amateur and was 2nd overall, just one shot behind the winner, who was a competing professional on the European Tour. Also in 2005, Zu√´l shot a course record 60 on the way to winning the Weston-Super-Mare Open and qualified for the Daily Telegraph Final held in Dubai. As part of her duties for Team Faldo, Zu√´l won the Faldo Series East region and qualified to play in the final at the Celtic Manor Resort, the scene of Team Europe‚Äôs third successive win the following year in the Ryder Cup. In 2006, Zu√´l missed the cut by one shot in both the Hungarian and Tenerife Ladies Open, but did make the cut in the BMW Ladies Italian Open. All three tournaments were on the Ladies European Tour. She finished as the best amateur at the Hungarian and Italian ladies events. At Liphook, Zu√´l won the Scratch Cup (an annual 36-hole event), setting a new ladies' course record of 7 under par. She took this good form to the Mauritian Open, where she finished 7th. Zu√´l began 2007 in 2nd place at the St Rule Trophy held at the famous St Andrews course in Scotland and then went on to win the Girls' British Open Championship. Later in the year, she played for Europe in the Junior Solheim Cup in Sweden, winning her singles match and the cup with 14 points to 10 and was subsequently selected for the Great Britain & Ireland squad for 2007/08. Henni was also honoured with the Daily Telegraph‚Äôs Joyce Wethered Award. 2008: turning professional In early 2008, Zu√´l realised a lifetime's ambition by turning professional and immediately joined the Ladies European Tour, playing her first professional match in the Turkish Ladies Open. Zu√´l's goals remain clearly focused. She still practices several hours a day and is determined to become European number one and, with America also beckoning, her ultimate goal is to become world champion. \\"I want to be European No.1 and then world No.1 - without a doubt. It is just more hard work to get there. More enjoyable hard work. I just love practising and love trying to improve. I spend five to eight hours practising every day and then another two hours in the gym. Tiger has changed the game technically but also in terms of fitness and flexibility. That has helped so much.\\" Zu√´l also wants to draw more females into the sport by demonstrating how women can reach the top of the game and enjoy playing the sport. \\"What I really want to do is make golf accessible to young girls and for them to see it more as a sport that can be played and enjoyed. I didn't really go out every weekend but it was something I enjoyed doing.\\" Despite having to put in countless hours of practice, Zu√´l still has plenty of time for other activities and believes her chosen vocation has never been in the way of her enjoying life to the full. \\"I don't feel like I've missed out on anything. I still go shopping with my friends and on cinema trips. For more girls to be play would be absolutely amazing.\\" Transition to broadcasting After struggling with injuries, Zu√´l stopped playing golf for the 2015 season, and became golf analyst for British television channel Sky Sports. In February 2019 she moved to the online broadcaster GolfTV. Management and David Beckham In 2008, Zu√´l signed to the same management that also looks after footballer David Beckham. Zu√´l has said she often speaks to the football star about the pressures and pitfalls of professional sport: \\"He is an inspiration to me ‚Äì he has helped me a lot with advice and how to deal with different things. [‚Ä¶] We speak whenever we feel the need to and the one thing he says is: 'Just keep focused.' He inspires me to work hard and go the extra mile to achieve things.\\" Home club During the 2009 season, Henni moved to the Wiltshire and Somerset area, and now plays and practices at her home club of Cumberwell Park in Bradford on Avon. Private life In 2015, she married professional golfer Estanislao Goya. They then got divorced in 2018.

The epic which has the form of a fairy tale (M√§rchen) and for which Hilsenrath received many prizes is regarded as the most important book about this historical episode. In 2006 the president of Armenia presented the author with the State Award for Literature of the Republic of Armenia for his work.  Content  The Story of the Last Thought is the history of a village in Anatolia that is being destroyed by the Turks. The main character is the Armenian Wartan Khatisian, whose son Thovma is dying. His last thought - the last thought of a man, the fairy tale says, is beyond time - is being told the history of his ancestors, the life of suffering of the Armenian people. The storyteller Meddah guides the last thought of Thovma along the life paths of his father, that lead from a small idyllic mountain village into the torture chambers of the Turkish rulers, and let him become a witness of the big pogrom against the Armenians in 1915. \\"By means of an oriental fairy tale, and drawing from sagas and legends of this distressed nation, Hilsenrath goes far back into Armenian history and touches upon the plight of all genocide victims. A cruel book and nevertheless a book of love, of hope and of wonders.\\" (Cover text) Despite choosing a fictitious genre the historical facts have been carefully investigated and verified by the author. Translated into Armenian by Lili Ter-Minasyan.  Awards  For his epic The Story of the Last Thought Edgar Hilsenrath has received many prizes. In 1989 G√ºnter Grass presented him with the prestigious Alfred D√∂blin prize. In 2006 the president of Armenia, where Hilsenrath is regarded as a national hero, honoured him with the State Award for Literature of the Republic of Armenia for his work. Also in 2006 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the Yerevan State University for his work.  Reception and debate  After the first publication of Hilsenrath's novel (in Germany in 1989) the critic Alexander von Bormann wrote in the Swiss newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung with regard to Franz Werfel's The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, the novel that had previously been considered to be the most important book about Armenia in world literature: \\"But I think Hilsenrath's novel is significantly superior to Werfel's: it is a historic and poetic novel at the same time.\\" According to Dagmar C. G. Lorenz, \\"Hilsenrath's Marchen vom letzten Gedanken is a powerful artistic statement against all forms of oppression. In addition to racism and nationalist arrogance, Hilsenrath isolates inequality, poverty, and ignorance, but above all, dishonesty, as factors contributing to genocide. The dynamics of oppression and submission are present in all enclaves of society and thus difficult to combat, although Hilsenrath argues that to avoid further genocides they must be eradicated.\\" Manfred Orlick judged: \\"Over and over they say: one cannot write about this topic like this. But the author has managed to delineate the cruelties through innumerable short dialogues, to portray them movingly and in this way get across the historical facts. An inhuman book of fairy tales as only Hilsenrath could write it.\\" The author himself considers The Story of the Last Thought to be his most poetic work. The English translation was published in Great Britain in 1990 (paperback 1994).

Instead of being disheartened by the setback, it served to motivate Luis to come back and just get better. With hard work and determination he continued to develop as a fighter at such an impressive pace that in just one year he had become Puerto Rico's National Junior Olympics champion, bringing medals to the island during his 2-year reign. The trend continued as he represented the island at the 2004 under 19 World Championships in Korea. Being too young to try out for the 2004 Olympic team, his trainer sent him to New York where he won both the New York and National Golden Gloves tournaments representing Newburgh Boxing Club.

With the win Del Valle clinched his first professional boxing title having knocked out 80% of his opponents to date. * As part of the Paul Williams-Sergio Martinez II undercard Del Valle had the chance to set the record straight against Noe Lopez Jr. Putting on a nearly flawless performance Orlandito dropped Lopez three times on his way to a third-round TKO victory. * On February 18, 2011 fighting in Ponce Puerto Rico Del Valle moved to 12-0, 10 KOs by stopping fellow Puerto Rican Irvin Hernandez at 2:49 of round six. * June 11, 2011 Showtime's ShoBox: The New Generation main event against fellow prospect Dat Nguyen in New York on the eve of the Puerto Rican day parade. Del Valle dominated by scores of 99-91 on all three official score cards. * In September 2012 Del Valle made his HBO debut. In what was perceived as a big step up in competition at 16-0 he faced off against veteran three-division world champion \\"The Raging Bull\\" Vic Darchinyan 37-5-1. The experienced Darchinyan, arguably a worthy candidate for Hall of Fame induction showed that he had no plans on passing the torch. He imposed his style on the young prospect who put his heart, will and solid chin on display. Del Valles determination almost paid off when he managed to badly hurt the former champion with a left hook near the end of round 9. The experience and ring smarts of the veteran showed up as Darchinyan was able to hold on and survive the round en route to a 10-round unanimous decision win. \\"The Raging Bull\\" provided confirmation of his still excellent fighting shape against then top 10 pound for pounder Nonito Donaire. Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards when he was hurt and stopped in the 9th round. * After the loss Del Valle moved to Mexico City to train with Hall of Fame trainer Nacho Beristain. In his first and only fight out of Beristain's Romanza Gym, Del Valle returned to the winning path with a 5th round stoppage of Andre Wilson. * November 30, 2013 in Carolina Puerto Rico, Del Valle needed only four rounds to beat tough Mexican Juan Jose Beltran * January 17, 2014 Del Valle was dominating cagey veteran Ira Terry when a cut caused by a head butt put an end to the fight which was ruled a no contest. * On May 31, 2014 Orlandito faced off against rising prospect and fellow Puerto Rican Luis Rosa (16-0-0). A left hook from Del Valle sent Rosa to the canvas in the fifth round. Two rounds later Rosa was docked a point for low blows in what turned into a rough and bloody battle. In the end Rosa was awarded a controversial unanimous decision. Many observers expressed their disagreement with the final scorecards. On March 14, 2015, Del Valle returned to Puerto Rico and faced Mexico's Rogelio Castaneda, a fighter who a few months earlier had gained notoriety in the island for losing a highly controversial majority decision against the unbeaten Puerto Rican prospect Jose \\"Wonder Boy\\" Lopez. Orlandito scored a TKO win after 8 action packed rounds. The knock out of Castaneda started a winning streak that helped Del Valle get back in the mix. After defeating Marylands, Thomas Snow (18-2) in Washington DC, he was back on track.  Right hand injury  On September 17, 2016 as part of the under card for Canelo √Ålvarez vs Liam Smith, Del Valle faced off against highly touted prospect Diego de la Hoya. After being competitive for the first 3 rounds, Del Valle suffered a severe injury on his right hand and continued to fight despite the injury. De la Hoya went on to win a unanimous decision. Del Valle has been away from the ring ever since. He went through surgical procedures and is currently in the process of recovering from his 2016 injury. It is expected Del Valle could be making his return to the ring at some point in early 2019. Post fight photo  Outside the ring  Since his initial move to the USA to compete at the Golden Gloves, New York became Del Valle's second home. He is now fully bilingual which allows him to connect directly with his New York fan base as well as with his Puerto Rican fan base mostly through his social media activity. Del Valle considers himself a hardcore boxing fan and has become a recurrent TV commentator in various boxing cards. He feels very passionate about his broadcasting opportunities and hopes to one day be part of a broadcast team where he can contribute both in English and his native Spanish language.

Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft. New York: Alfred A Knopf, 1947. The existence of this paper has not been conclusively confirmed, but it has been widely discussed. History The history of mummy paper in America is intimately connected with the history of both American papermaking and papermaking in general. =Supply shortages= Paper can be said to have been born in ancient Egypt, circa 2000 B.C., with the invention of what the Romans called ‚Äúpapyrus‚Äù, based on an earlier Greek name for the material. Papyrus is not paper in the modern sense of the word, since it was formed from compressed sheets of reed stalks and not a pulp. Paper made from a pulped plant fiber can be credited to Ts‚Äôai Lun of China in 105 A.D., when he first presented the Emperor a sheet of paper made from the inner bark of a mulberry tree. When the technique of papermaking found its way into Europe, paper was made not from trees but from a pulp of cotton and linen rag fibers. This technique of papermaking first came to America in Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1690 when William Rittenhouse established the first paper mill. Rittenhouse had been a papermaker in Amsterdam, the Netherlands before coming to America, bringing European techniques with him.Fulling, Edmund H. ‚ÄúBotanical Aspects of the Paper-Pulp and Tanning Industries in the United States ‚Äì An Economic and Historical Survey.‚Äù American Journal of Botany. 43 (1956): 621-634. By the 1850s, papermaking in America was reaching a crisis point. America was producing more newspapers than any other country and its paper consumption was equal to England and France‚Äôs combined. According to one 1856 estimate, it would take 6,000 wagons, each carrying two tons of paper, to carry all the paper consumed by American newspapers in a single year.Baker, Nicholson. ‚ÄúVirgin Mummies.‚Äù Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper. New York: Random House, 2001. This equals out to a need for 405,000,000 pounds of rags for the 800 paper mills then at work in the United States.Fulling, 622. Most of these rags were imported from Europe, with the largest source being from Italy. By 1854, however, Italy also started exporting rags to England, decreasing the supply available to American paper-makers.Baker, 56. This meant that a substitute for or a new supply source of rags needed to be found, and quickly. =Isaiah Deck= At this same time period, Egyptian mummies were reasonably known to the public in America. Many mummies had been part of exhibits and had been shown in museums and traveling shows across the country. In fact, Dr. Pettigrew was the operator of one such show, where he would unwrap or unroll mummies in front of a crowd for their amusement.Wolfe, S.J. ‚ÄúI. Augustus Stanwood had a PaperMill in Maine.‚Äù Kennebec Historical Society Meeting. Christ Church, Gardiner, ME. 19 July 2006. The impetus for a new supply source of rags for paper may have come from Dr. Isaiah Deck, an Englishman by birth, a New Yorker by residence, a geologist by trade, an archeologist by hobby and a determined explorer. On an earlier copper prospecting trip to Jamaica, Deck had evaluated other sources for paper including aloe, plantain, banana and dagger-grass, but none were acceptable.Baker, 55-56. Thus, already preoccupied with paper and paper sources, Deck set out on a trip to Egypt in 1847 to search for Cleopatra‚Äôs lost emerald mines. Deck‚Äôs father, also named Isaiah, had known Giovanni Belzoni, a famous Italian robber of Egyptian tombs; Deck the younger thus inherited from his father some Egyptian artifacts, including a piece of linen from a mummy.Baker, 58. While searching for the lost mines, Deck couldn‚Äôt help but notice the plethora of mummies and mummy parts that turned up in communal burial sites called ‚Äúmummy pits.‚Äù He wrote, ‚ÄúSo numerous are they in some localities out of the usual beaten tracks of most travelers, that after the periodical storms whole areas may be seen stripped of sand, and leaving fragments and limbs exposed in such plenty and variety.‚ÄùDeck, Isaiah. ‚ÄúOn a Supply of Paper Material from the Mummy Pits of Egypt.‚Äù Transactions of the American Institute of the City of New-York, for the year 1854. Albany: C. Van Benthuysen, 1855. 83-93. Deck did some calculations: assume two thousand years of widespread embalming, an average life span of thirty-three years and a stable population of eight million. This would leave you with about five hundred million mummies. Add to that the number of mummified animals including cats, bulls and crocodiles, and the number drastically rises. Deck also states, ‚Äúit is by no means rare to find above 30 lbs. weight of linen wrappings on mummies‚Ä¶A princess from the late Mr. Pettigrew‚Äôs collection was swathed in 40 thicknesses, producing 42 yards of the finest texture.‚ÄùDeck, 87. Deck further calculated that the average consumption of paper in America is about 15 lbs. per person per year. This meant that the supply from Egyptian mummies would be able to keep up with the American demand for about 14 years, by which point a substitute supply source or material would likely have been discovered, rendering the need for rags unnecessary.Deck, 87-88. Evidence Whether or not American paper mills took Isaiah Deck‚Äôs proposal seriously cannot be either conclusively proved or rejected. However, some evidence does remain. =Dard Hunter= Dard Hunter is a well-known paper researcher and cataloguer and a proponent of handmade paper. His book, Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, relates the experiments of I. Augustus Stanwood in both ground-wood paper and mummy paper. Hunter received his information from Stanwood‚Äôs son Daniel, a professor of international law. According to Daniel, during the American Civil War his father was hard-pressed for materials for his Maine mill. As such, he imported mummies from Egypt, stripped the bodies of their wrappings and used this material for making paper. Several shiploads of mummies were brought to the mill in Gardiner, Maine and were thus used to make a brown wrapping paper for grocers, butchers and other merchants. Professor Stanwood continues on to report that the rags supposedly caused a cholera outbreak among the workers since there were no standards for disinfection at this time. However, since cholera is actually a bacterium, it is unlikely that active disease cells could have survived for centuries in the wrappings, meaning the outbreak at the plant was likely either from poor personal hygiene of the workers or from dirty rags recently imported from deceased Europeans, primarily Frenchmen and Italians, rather than the mummy rags.Wolfe, S.F. ‚ÄúMummy Paper and Pestilence.‚Äù Online posting. 6 Jan. 2004. Exlibris. . Hunter also writes in an extensive footnote of a letter he received from a Mrs. John Ramsey of Syracuse, New York, relating the story her father‚Äôs friend used to tell her of his days in a paper mill in Broadalbin, New York. He worked there from 1855‚Äì1860 and was one of the men responsible for unrolling the old linen wrappings from the mummies the mill received. She wrote to Hunter that ‚Äúthe rolled-up vestments retained the shape of the mummy, so that when the workmen tried to straighten or unroll the ‚Äòcocoon‚Äô‚Ä¶it sprang back at once into the shape of the mummy it had encased so long.‚ÄùHunter, 383. She also describes the material as cream-coloured linen still bearing fragments of embroidery on the edges. Hunter also writes about and quotes from Deck‚Äôs proposal on the importation of mummies. However, Hunter refers to the work as a manuscript, leaving Joseph Dane to dismiss the work off-hand, stating that the work could not be found and implying that Hunter invented it to suit his purpose.Dane, Joseph A. ‚ÄúThe Curse of the Mummy Paper.‚Äù Printing History. 17.2 (1995): 18-25. This claim of Dane must also be dismissed, since authors both before and since Dane, including Deck‚Äôs contemporaries and modern authors, among which are both Wolfe and Baker, have been able to find copies of this paper. Dane also dismisses Deck‚Äôs writing, and therefore Hunter‚Äôs, on the basis that it is in the mode of Swiftonian satire. He cites Deck‚Äôs references to thrift, concern with alleviating shortages and his precision in his calculations as further evidence of his writing in the manner of Book 3 of Gulliver‚Äôs Travels. Dane also writes that Hunter should have realized that Deck wasn't serious, thus questioning Hunter‚Äôs own authority in the field.Dane, 21-22. =Evidence from periodicals= It is a verifiable fact that rags from Egypt were imported during this time period. Joel Munsell was a prolific printer and publisher from Albany, New York and he kept a scrapbook of articles relating to his trade. This eventually became the basis for his book Chronology of the Origin and Progress of Paper and Paper-Making. For an entry from 1855, Munsell records that a cargo of 1215 bales of Egyptian rags arrived and were purchased by J Priestly & Co. for about 4 cents a pound. His source, the Paper Trade Reporter, stated that the final purchase price for the transaction was $25,000.Wolfe, ‚ÄúAugustus,‚Äù 6-7. The next year, the New York Tribune wrote that about two and a quarter million pounds of rags have been imported from Egypt.Baker, 61. Articles discussing the practicality and the financial implications of the import of mummies for paper for the government of Egypt and American paper mills were also published in the 7 July 1847 issue of The Friend, the 19 June 1847 issue of Scientific American and the 17 December 1847 issue of the Cold War Fountain.Wolfe, ‚ÄúAugustus,‚Äù 8-9. While none of these articles confirm the manufacture of said paper in America, they do prove that the concept was both widely spoken of and under discussion in well-known and respected periodicals of the day. Another article ran in the April 1873 edition of The Druggists‚Äô Circular and Chemical Gazette that described an 1866 visit of a New York businessman to Alexandria. There, he purchased and ‚Äúexported to the United States ‚Äòmummies from the catacombs‚Äô to be converted to pulp for papermaking.‚Äù This article also pointed out that mummies weren't ideal for printing paper due to the various oils and botanicals included in the rags, which lead to the discoloration of the paper.Sumner, Judith. American Household Botany: A History of Useful Plants, 1620-1900. Portland: Timber Press, 2004. This corroborates Hunter‚Äôs report that Stanwood‚Äôs mill used the mummies to make a brown butcher paper. On 31 July 1856, the Syracuse Standard ran a notice in its paper that informed readers that it was printed on paper made from rags imported directly from Egypt. The rags were imported by Mr. G.W. Ryan and were processed at his plant in Marcellus Falls.Baker, 61-62. Munsell adds the note that the rags were stripped from mummies.Wolfe, ‚ÄúAugustus,‚Äù 14. Hunter reports that he is unable to find a copy of this issue, and Dane takes this to mean that the paper didn't claim to have been printed on mummy paper, but just on rags from the region of mummies.Dane, 20. Baker, however, has located a copy of the paper at the Onondaga Historical Association and confirmed both the wording of the notice and the physical difference of this issue from those before it.Baker, 63-64. =Evidence against mummy paper= Dane argues that mummy paper cannot possibly exist because all the references to the paper are either vaguely documented or are the product of oral history. He also argues that they have an aura of Swift about them and that all the original writers have the intent of satire. Dane also states that neither the copy of the Standard on mummy paper can be found, nor can Deck‚Äôs article be found, both of which statements have clearly been proven wrong.Dane, 23. There are indeed some facts that make proving the concrete existence of mummy paper impossible. First off, the paper from the Standard and the Norwich broadside cannot be chemically tested to prove they are from mummies, as the test would only prove they are made of linen. Nor can they be carbon-14 dated. This test requires the burning of the material, meaning that items that exist in only one or two copies would have to be destroyed to complete the test, something that clearly cannot be done. Also, mummies were made for over 4,000 years in Egypt, so even a time frame for the paper product wouldn't narrow down the age of the material to a useful window for solid conclusions to be made. Additionally, the percentage of mummy cloth to any other rag in a given pulp mixture could skew the results of the test. DNA testing would also prove to be inconclusive, as the only thing this test would verify is that the material at one point had close contact with a human. Outside of scientific tests, there are no extant records of paper mills buying mummies. If there were records or account books, they have either been lost or recycled by the mill itself for more paper. There are no photographs of mummies or mummy wrappings at any paper mills. Shipping records and custom records have likewise vanished. However, these may not have proved anything conclusively either; since rags for paper were duty-free at this time, the cargo wouldn't have needed to have been declared. Even if the mummy rags had been declared, they probably would have been declared as rags for paper, without the provenance given.Wolfe, ‚ÄúAugustus,‚Äù 25-27. Other industrial uses for mummies Perhaps the most famous claimed use of mummies in other industries than papermaking appeared in Mark Twain‚Äôs novel Innocents Abroad. He writes of the practice then current on the Egyptian railroad of using mummies for fuel to power the locomotives. > I shall not speak of the railway, for it is like any other railway‚ÄîI shall > only say that the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies > three thousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that > purpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out > pettishly, \\"D--n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent‚Äîpass out a > King ‚Ä¶Twain, Mark. The Innocents Abroad, or, The New Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress. New > York: Signet Classics, 1997. This master story teller was speaking tongue in cheek. He lets the reader in on the joke in the next passage, which reads \\"Stated to me for a fact. I only tell it as I got it. I am willing to believe it. I can believe any thing.\\" This story has been mentioned by a number of seemingly reliable secondary sources, including an article in Scientific American in 1859 and, more recently, a paper published for BBC News in 2011. As Heather Pringle noted in her definitive book The Mummy Congress, \\"no expert has ever been able to authenticate the story ... Twain seems to be the only published source -- and a rather suspect one at that.\\" There are many sources relating to the use of ground-up mummies in pharmaceuticals. In fact, Merck & Company sold mummy up until 1910. Ground-up mummified bodies also produce a brown pigment, still referred to as ‚Äúmummy brown‚Äù or ‚ÄúEgyptian brown‚Äù.Woolfe, ‚ÄúAugustus,‚Äù 2. The color is no longer produced from mummies.Natural Pigments. 28 June 2008. http://naturalpigments.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=460-22S. Additional by- products of mummies include the distillation of the bodies to produce aromatic oils, such as olibanum and ambergris, which can be made into machine oils, soaps or even incense.Baker, 59. Clearly, mummies were a multi-product import of choice, much as the buffalo or whale had been before them.

Rosenthal, \\"Juanita Harrison (1891‚Äì?)\\", in Emmanuel Sampath Nelson (ed.), African American Authors, 1745-1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, 2000, p. 220. was an African-American writer known only for her autobiography, My Great, Wide, Beautiful World (1936), which narrates her extensive travel abroad. No record exists of her life after the publication of her book. Hence, her date of death cannot be determined. She died in 1967 and was laid to rest at The Valley of Temples in Oahu. Memory slope, 562- B2 Biography Harrison was born in Mississippi in an especially racially oppressive situation for African Americans, especially women. The times were marked by racism, segregation, laborious jobs for minorities, and few if any opportunities for advancement. Harrison did not receive much schooling, as told in the preface of her book. Her school education ceased when she was about ten years old. Her early years started with \\"an endless round of cooking, washing, and ironing in an overburdened household,\\" the norm for young Afro-American women in that time and place. There is not much known about her parents and family life other than what is presented in the preface to her autobiography. Harrison's physical appearance is also a mystery to the readers. She is spoken of by a former employer's daughter as having \\"a slight form, fresh complexion, long hair braided about her head, made her appear younger than her years\\". This is the only description given about her looks. Harrison observed that people she met on her travels assumed she was Middle Eastern, Hindi or Mexican based on her appearance, especially when she adopted local attire. Harrison autographed a copy of her book and gave several personal photographs of herself to Mr and Mrs Frank Estes, on whose property in Hawaii she lived when she returned from her world travels. My Great, Wide, Beautiful World Harrison began her travels at the age of 16, traversing the world and exploring 22 countries all by herself. This was quite rare for her time. Harrison funded her travels by working various jobs wherever she happened to be. She described being employed as a nurse, nanny, and cleaning lady, among other trades of a similar sort. Her initial money came from the investments of a former employer of Los Angeles, California, George W. Dickinson and Myra K. Dickinson. The Dickinsons invested portions of her salary in real estate and gave her the profits. Harrison had long expressed a love of travel and a need to see the world; these kind employers helped her get started. The investments soon yielded $200 in interest per year. Harrison dedicated the book to Myra Dickinson in an act of gratitude. Once Harrison was on the road she stayed in YMCAs and was able to learn French and Spanish. These language skills, especially French, helped her in many countries. She often looked up the numbers to the local boarding houses and planned her trips around her lodging accommodations. In each country she travels to, Harrison becomes enamored by something exquisite and unique. For example, she remarked about her journeys, \\"Can't but help love the last place best\\" (19). Visiting the Taj Mahal in India was different from the Eiffel Tower in France; Harrison expresses her travels as individual revelations and experiences that could not be duplicated. She said of the Taj Mahal, \\"It thrilled me through as the beauty cannot be painted‚Ä¶this was built through love, from the love of a man for a woman so it was much nicer\\" (133). The book consists of her journal entries, mistakes included on her insistence: ‚Äújust as I have written them misteakes and all. I said that if the mistekes are left out there‚Äôll be only blank‚Äù (243). The pure, uncorrected language she uses to record her travels allows the reader to read it as she truly meant it to be conveyed. She was involved in the September 10, 1928 Zajeƒç√≠-B≈ôeclav train accident in Czechoslovakia,18 DIE IN TRAIN WRECK IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA; 30 Hurt, Score Missing After Paris-Berlin-Vienna Express Hits Freight. New York Times, September 11, 1928. writing about it on September 13, 1928. She said the train had just pulled out of Brno. Twenty-six people were killed and many injured. Harrison wrote of trying to comfort a young German woman who was mortally injured and died in her arms. She was able to turn her most dangerous experience into profit; she asked for compensation of damages for a black eye and received the $200 she asked for. In Turkey she compared the men and evaluated her treatment. Her reactions to a man who hit her are quite candid and likely cannot be mistaken for a fabricated story. > \\"He ask another man if I was French and tryed to hold my hand I got angry > and Hit Him in the Face and quick as litning He hit me in the Face ... that > was my first fight, and the only ungentleman man I have meet in Turkey sorry > it happen as I had been thinking all day if I had to give a prize to the > most respectfully men it would go to the Turks, the other men felt so sad\\" > (90). This incident sheds light on the culture of the men she has just encountered and although shocked, in hindsight she perceives the mishap as a learning experience. Harrison realizes that sometimes women also have to defend themselves physically, not just morally. She was frequently attracted to men on her travels, and they to her, but she usually evaded them if they got too insistent. In Europe and the Middle East, Harrison also experienced some things most black women her age and of her time could not: freedom from racial oppression, lack of border boundaries, and the chance to publish her story. Time has forgotten about My Great Wide Beautiful World but her autobiographical travelogue of events received attention when it was published. Time magazine wrote an article about her book the year it was published: ‚ÄúReaders of My Great Wide Beautiful World will admire not only Juanita's freedom from economic shackles but her impressionistic spelling, sometimes better than right.‚Äù The article highlighted excerpts of the book and examines them positively. Selections of Harrison's book were also published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1935. In 1994, paper engineer and book artist Carol Barton quoted Harrison's vivid description of a train ride from Istanbul in A Journal Of One's Own, a guide to making and writing a journal.Carol Barton, A Journal of One's Own: A Handcrafting Kit. Running Press, 1994. Critical reception Although Harrison only published one book, she has received some critical attention. The encyclopedia African American Authors, 1745‚Äì1945: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook edited by Emmanuel S. Nelson includes an entry on Harrison written by Debra J. Rosenthal. According to Rebecca Chalmers Barton, Harrison is a woman \\"who is not concerned about all the whys and wherefores of her past life but who only wants to convey her immediate joys to the readers.\\" (89) Rosenthal argues that the book concentrates on the \\"here and now.\\" For example, Harrison uses the present tense throughout the book in her conversational tone and carefree manner. While in Belgrade, a passing girl carrying food caught Harrison's attention and she wrote, \\"where ever you go I'll flower it smelled so good I flowered Her 2 blocks\\" (88). Although the girl was a stranger to Harrison, the writer did follow the food seller to some extent, demonstrating that the \\"here and now\\" could be at any time and in anyplace for Harrison. This allows, as Barton says, the readers to gather and share in Harrison's immediate joys. Juanita Harrison was a woman ahead of her time, traveling alone and not timid about requiring respect for her morals and living conditions. Yet, her book reads as a humble comment on issues still relevant to women and non-Anglos today. Rosenthal also mentions that the times Harrison lived in were marred by racism and that she unlike so many others \\"easily melds into any society and seems to be accepted by all.\\" Harrison herself says that while \\"at the Aleppo they thought I was Chinese. Here they think I am Aribian\\" (65). The issue of race will no doubt be uppermost for modern readers. Yet, Harrison leaves all those troubles behind to find herself immersed in the new cultures she so loves. While visiting Madrid, she remarked, \\"Bull fighting and ice cream are the two best things on earth\\" (99).

According to tradition, he defended Todi during a Gothic siege. He is the patron saint of Todi. He is praised by Gregory the Great, who calls him a man of great virtue who took great care in attending to the sick. Gregory, who was born around the time that Fortunatus died, was greatly interested in Fortunatus' life. Gregory writes that \\"a certain poor old man was brought to me ‚Äìbecause I always love to talk with such men- of whom I inquired his country, and hearing that he was of the city of Todi, I asked him whether he knew Bishop Fortunatus.

He was born into a prosperous Church of Ireland family, his father being John Worth (1648-1688), Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, who was a younger son of Edward Worth (1620-1669), Bishop of Killaloe and his wife Susannah Pepper. His father's eldest brother William Worth was an eminent judge. Edward's mother was named Comfort: she died in 1681. Edward was one of about ten children but only he and his brother Michael reached adulthood. Worth studied medicine in Oxford (matriculated 1693), Leiden and Utrecht (MD 1701) before practising as a doctor in Dublin. A financial windfall from his uncle William helped him to establish a large book collection, bought from places such as London, the Netherlands, France and Dublin, in addition to those he had inherited from his father and grandfather. On his death the collection consisted of some 4,400 books, many on medicine, dating back in some cases to the fifteenth century. Worth left his library, then valued at ¬£5,000, to Dr Steevens' Hospital in Kilmainham, of which he was a governor. The hospital built a special room to house the books, which remain there today. According to a 2008 Irish Times article, the books have been stored well and are in remarkably good condition. Edward Worth was an important figure in the Dublin of his day. He was a friend and contemporary of such people as Jonathan Swift, and his library is remarkable, not only for its size and variety, but also for the condition of the books, some of which are hundreds of years old but appear almost new. Between 1715 and 1727, Worth sat in the Irish House of Commons for New Ross. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1699. He is buried in the family tomb in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

It is currently known as St. Patrick Church. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History St. Patrick Parish began in 1862 in response to the influx of Irish Catholics into Detroit. The parish built a chapel on Adelaide near John R. Street, which was eventually expanded into a church. St. Patrick's became one of Detroit's largest and wealthiest parishes, although the church was never one of Detroit's largest or most impressive. In 1890, the church was named the cathedral of the diocese and was renamed in honor of Sts. Peter and Paul as the prior cathedral church on East Jefferson had been. Bishop Caspar Borgess gave the old Sts. Peter and Paul to the Jesuits in 1877 after he moved to the new cathedral. In 1892, to serve the children of the community, the Sts. Peter and Paul Academy was built on Parsons west of Woodward, which was some distance away from the main church.Chapel of St. Theresa, the Little Flower from the city of Detroit By the 1920s the streets in the area had become so busy that the trek from church to school was considered unsafe for children going to school Masses. As a remedy, the parish constructed the Chapel of St. Theresa, the Little Flower in 1927, naming the chapel after Th√©r√®se de Lisieux. In 1938, the cathedral function was transferred to Blessed Sacrament parish and St. Patrick's reverted to its original name. As the years passed, the area around the original St. Patrick church steadily declined, and more activities were held in the chapel and school. All activities were moved to Parsons Street in the 1980s and the old church was given to a community group. Essentially abandoned for a number of years, it was then vandalized and eventually burned in 1992. Due to declining membership, Archbishop Allen Vigneron announced May 8, 2015, that the parish would dissolve May 25. The archdiocese said it will retain the structure in the hope that the parish can be reactivated at a future date due to revitalization of the area. Architecture The chapel is in the Romanesque Revival style with a basilica floorplan. It is constructed of red brick with limestone accents and a red tile roof. The entrance is recessed in twin arches framed by square bays. The bays are each topped by a limestone portico consisting of a barrel vault supported by four Corinthian columns. The gabled roofs of the porticoes are covered with red tile matching the other portions of the roof. Above the entry doors on the clerestory level are small arched windows and above the clerestory is a small rose window. Above the porticos are two small campanario each holding a bell.

Tradition says that the heathens set fire to Xavier\`s house and reduced it to ashes, but they were struck with awe when they saw the holy man on his knees devoutly praying, not in the least touched by the flames. To mark the place a cross was put up, to which miraculous powers were attributed. From the time the church was built on the spot, a lamp is kept perpetually burning.

In addition to the area's German-speaking population, St. Mary's served the neighborhood's Italian immigrants until the Diocese of Indianapolis established Holy Rosary Catholic Church, an Italian national parish, in Indianapolis in 1911. After the turn of the century, when the neighborhood become commercial, the parish purchased property at New Jersey and Vermont streets, where they built the present church, which was under construction from 1910 to 1912.

He was a major figure in the French Imperial conquest of the French Sudan, modern Mali. He was Commandant-Superior of the French Military Territory of Haut-S√©n√©gal (French territory of Upper Senegal), attached to the colonial government of Senegal, 1880 to 1883. Early career Born into a family from Morlaix, Gustave's grandfather was a Deputy from Finist√®re, and his father was a military engineer trained at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique. Gustave also graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique on 18 October 1859, and went on to the Army Artillery School at Metz. He received his first commission to the Troupes de marine transferred to a Marine regiment at the naval base in Toulon, with the rank of Capitan. From 16 February 1868 to 1 March 1871, Borgnis-Desbordes was assigned to units fighting in the French colonial campaign in Cochinchine (Vietnam). In 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, he was made adjutant to General Fr√©bault in Paris. He was made Chef d'escadron in 1875 and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. Senegal and French Soudan Borgnis-Desbordes is most remembered as a daring and restless commander of the French colonial expansion into the Middle Niger River Valley. He served as a Lieutenant-Colonel under the Governor of Senegal Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle (1876‚Äì1881). Between 1880 and 1883 Borgnis-Desbordes was Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve, Commander of the Military Territory of Haut Senegal, which was later expanded to the east and rechristened French Soudan in 1890. He founded the French forts at Kita (1881) and Bamako (1883), which became two of the key towns of French Soudan. In the process he launched a series of military campaigns against the remnants of the regional power of the Tukulor Empire, which was finally overthrown by Colonel Louis Archinard in 1890. =Under the governor of Senegal= Under both Bri√®re de l'Isle in Senegal, and as chief officer in the Soudan, Borgnis-Desbordes developed a reputation for violence and insubordination, leading the territorial expansion of French power in the absence of, and sometimes in direct contradiction of the Ministry of Marine, the government arm which controlled colonial forces. Borgnis-Desbordes led the French conquest of the remnants of the Imamate of Futa Toro, along what is today the northeastern border of Senegal, which Briere de l'Isle ordered in contradiction of government directives. In 1878 Borgnis-Desbordes led a French force against the Kaarta Toucouleur vassal state along the north bank of the Senegal River. Blocked by the colonial minister in Paris, Briere de l'Isle argued that Kaarta was a threat to the new protectorate in Fouta Tooro, and that British agents were infiltrating the area. The Ministry gave in, and on 7 July 1878, Borgnis-Desbordes forces destroyed the Kaarta Toucouleur fort at Saboucir√©, killing their leader, Almany Niamody. This portion of the Kaarta vassals were then incorporated into the Khasso Wolof protectorate kingdom.A. S. Kanya-Forstner, The Conquest of the Western Sudan. Cambridge University Press, (1969), pp. 57‚Äì59 =Commander of the first French Soudan colony= As Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve, Borgnis-Desbordes attack on Bamako in 1880 was the trigger for Bri√®re de l'Isle's dismissal, and his attack on Samory Tour√©'s forces in 1883 began a conflict which only ended in 1893. Under Bri√®re de l'Isle: 1881 The French fort at Kita (1904). This was the base of Lt. Colonel Borgnis- Desbordes's forces during his time as Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve. When Bri√®re de l'Isle appointed Borgnis-Desbordes Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve on 6 September 1880, he was also given the rank of Lt. Colonel, outranking all other French officials in the area, essentially appointing him a Lieutenant Governor. of all territory to the east of Senegal, beginning at the confluence of the Senegal River and Fal√©m√©. Borgnis-Desbordes arrived in Bafoulab√© on 1 January 1881, and moved his forces onto Kita on 7 February, where he established his headquarters. From his base in Kita, Borgnis- Desbordes had the authority to conduct all aspects of French policy in the Soudan, including exploration, railway construction and defense. With a battalion of Tirailleurs s√©n√©galais at his command, Borgnis-Desbordes set about the work of establishing bases all along the proposed Dakar-Niger Railway, bringing African states under French rule, and scouting for a rail terminus on the Niger River.Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 87‚Äì94 In 1881, within two weeks of receiving the order to halt at Kita, he destroyed the village of Goubanko, fifteen kilometers to the east. This was the instigation for Bri√®re de l'Isle's removal by Minister Clou√©. Clou√© ordered Bri√®re de l'Isle to pull back Borgnis-Desbordes forces, the Lt. Colonel did so, complaing to his commanders. In fact, Clou√© had given strict orders that no movement to the east would take place as fellow Marine officer Joseph Gallieni was then in Segu, negotiating a trade treaty with the Toukolor leaders, and under virtual house arrest.Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 87‚Äì88 Borgnis-Desbordes returned to Paris in mid-1881, but instead of being punished, the Ministry began to throw their weight behind him. In fact, be became their expert on the Soudan, (Gallieni was now in Martinique recovering from his long stay in Segu) and Borgnis-Desbordes briefings carried much weight. The Lt. Colonel told the Ministry, then planning a series of slow topographical expeditions and enabling peace treaties for the rail line, that \\"The Peaceful conquest of the Niger is an illusion.\\"Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 88‚Äì89. Kanya-Forstner gives the source of this quote, on page 88, as \\"Desbordes, report 1880‚Äì1881 (6 July 1881), in Archives Nationale du France d'Outre Mer: S√©n√©gal IV 73\\" =Second expedition to the Niger= Borgnis-Desbordes arrived in Saint-Louis in the midst of typhoid and then yellow fever outbreaks, causing his planned July mission to be suspended. The epidemics also killed the new Governor of Senegal, Rear-Admiral Delanneau, and led to disorder which his replacement, Colonel Canard, could not quell. While this pushed back Borgnis-Desbordes's plans, by 1882, he had cemented his position. The Ministry had no strong leader in Senegal, and Borgnis-Desbordes now had influence in Paris. His plan to build a fort past Kita was accepted, although his fort at Bamako was still blocked. The Lt. Colonel sent a column that reached the Niger, crossed the river, and attacked forces of Samory Toure that were besieging a local leader at Keni√©ra. According to Borgnis-Desbordes, this was a punishment for a raid by Samory's troops on Galleini's expedition the previous year. Although reprimanded, Borgnis-Desbordes was too crucial to the Ministry's plans to be removed. The longer-term consequences were more grave. This began an ongoing war with Samory that lasted until 1898, the longest conflict in France's African conquest.Kanya-Forstner (1969), p. 89 In early March 1882, the French government approved funding for the railway (even at 7,500,000 francs, a doubling of previous requests), and placed Jaur√©guiberry, a former Governor of Senegal and supporter of expansion, as Minister of Marine. In May 1882, Governor Canard was replaced with Captain Vallon. Borgnis-Desbordes' push to occupy Bamako was again put off by the Ministry but the plan was supported by the Minister's advisors, Lt. Colonel Bourdiaux Director of Colonies Paul Disl√®re. After another visit to Paris in July‚ÄìAugust 1882, Borgnis-Desbordes got his way, convincing leaders that only continued expansion would enable the rail project to be built in a timely manner. In August, Jaur√©guiberry ordered the occupation of Bamako without consulting Vallon, and Borgnis-Desbordes quickly made Vallon recognise his authority, forcing the governor to provide Senegal's garrison for the expansion in the Soudan, under Borgnis-Desbordes's command. Vallon resigned in the fall, and was replaced with Ren√© Servatius, the former attorney general of Martinique who had been forced to resign in a scandal, giving Borgnis-Desbordes all the political capital.Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 90‚Äì93 Borgnis-Desbordes attacked the Toukolor fortress at Murgala in December 1882, risking the reignition of war with the major empire of the central Niger valley. Marching to the east, Borgnis-Desbordes captured Daba in Beledougou, reached the Niger and began construction of the Fort at Bamako on 1 February 1883. On 19 April, Bamako was connected to Senegal by telegraph lines.Chronologie Mali: clio.fr. Samory's forces attacked the new fort in April but were repulsed, freeing Borgnis-Desbordes troops to range far south of the Niger, and enabling him to force protectorate status on most of Beledougou. When word of the Bamako expedition reached France, Borgnis- Desbordes became a hero. Having secured the a rail line to the Niger, he returned to Paris, was promoted to Colonel, and was made head of the Haut- Senegal and Niger division of the Ministry.Kanya-Forstner (1969), pp. 993‚Äì94 Indochina (1884‚Äì1900) In 1884 he was transferred to Tonkin (northern Vietnam) in what became French Indochina. Borgnis-Desbordes was a commander during the Sino-French War, serving under his mentor Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle, now commander of forces in the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. After the defeat at the March 1885 Battle of Bang Bo, and the removal of Bri√®re de l'Isle, Borgnis-Desbordes remained in Indochina and was promoted to G√©n√©ral de brigade in 1886. On 1 January 1889 he was made Commander in Chief of Troops in Indochina, and in 1890, G√©n√©ral de division. An adamant colonialist to the end, he is famously quoted as saying the War in Indochina \\"was a case of seeing what you wanted and taking it.\\"L'Indochine serait en cas de guerre a qui voulait la prendre. Cited in C. M. Andrew and A. S. Kanya-Forstner (1971) Retiring from this command, he died in Hanoi on 18 July 1900. Monuments Several streets are named for Borgnis-Desbordes in France, including the Rue Borgnis-Desbordes near the Borgnis-Desbordes Army Barracks in Versailles. His bust is also displayed in the Hotel de Ville in Versailles. Rue Borgnis- Desbordes in Dakar, Senegal has survived independence, ironically forming an intersection with Rue Bri√®re de l'Isle. A statue of Borgnis-Desbordes in Bamako, commemorating his capture of the town in 1883, was torn down shortly after Mali's independence.Gregory Mann.

Various technologies to do this include Home theater PCs (desktop computers running more user- friendly software for TV viewing), digital media receivers (also known as \\"media extenders\\", replaying content from a local area network), and Smart TVs (television sets and set-top boxes with Internet capabilities).  Media extenders  Several companies provide media extenders including Netgear and Dlink. Advanced game consoles - Xbox 360 from Microsoft, PS3 from Sony, and the Nintendo Wii - can be configured to stream or view content delivered from a PC on the user's home network.  LocalCasting  A new entry from HDMI to Coax connects to the VGA output of a home PC/server and LocalCasts (transmits) it throughout the users house over the existing coax wiring as a normal HD Dolby 5.1 channel that is directly tunable by all connected HDTV's. A unique benefit of this approach is that no additional boxes are required at each TV because only single LocalCast device is required to insert a private channel on the homes coax distribution system. In order to do this the monitor output of the PC is digitized, MPEG2 compressed, and QAM encoded all at HD resolution and in real-time. The LocalCasting PC is controlled with an RF remote or RF keyboard that includes a pointing device to provide normal interactivity with any PC application within a range suitable for the normal home. Another important benefit of this over-the-top approach is that it provides the broadest access to internet content because it supports any content or application that can be viewed on a PC.  Video on demand  HD Encodulators are a new class of device in Digital Video Broadcast (DVB). Encodulators are devices that bundle a digital encoder and an RF agile modulator into one package. Encodulators accept uncompressed video as either HD or SD and encode the source to an MPEG transport stream. This transport stream can be based on either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4(H.264) broadcasting codecs. Once the video is encoded it is passed on to the modulator component of the device. The agile modulator overlays the MPEG transport stream onto a high frequency carrier wave for DTV broadcast. In the US this is typically in the 50 - 900 MHz range for terrestrial television, and 900 - 2600 MHz for satellite distribution. Standards used for terrestrial broadcast are 8-level Vestigial Sideband Modulation (8VSB) for over the air, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) for cable TV. A typical example of an encodulator are the units from Thor Broadcast. These units include both a high definition encoder and a frequency agile modulator for all major DVB modulation types. Many more manufacturers are moving to this sort of consolidated hardware platform. In the last year other manufacturers such as Comlan have released similar units. In the future we will see more and more broadcasting companies moving to consolidated equipment, both to save on rackspace and on cost.  Content subscription  KylinTV provides a \\"box\\" that serves a number of Chinese language web channels. The service is sold on a monthly subscription basis. Time Warner cable announced plans to offer a web to TV solution.  Internet-ready TV  Sony Bravia Internet Link provides Web to TV without a PC. Sony has also announced plans to integrate this functionality into future TVs. Several major TV suppliers have made similar claims. The advent of high performance, low cost processors from ARM and Intel will ultimately bring the Web to (every) TV.

Taphonomic processes Silica is emplaced around the organisms very rapidly, before their cells can even collapse; the strong silica is able to withstand great pressures and preserves three-dimensional detail even after metamorphosis. Microbial mats, as they decayed, acted as nuclei for silica precipitation. Occurrence The preservational mode is only present in the Precambrian, and is restricted to shallow or tidal waters. After this point, organisms such as sponges extracted silica from the oceans in order to construct tests (skeletons), with the result that the surface oceans no longer became supersaturated with respect to silica when evaporation condensed the mineral. Constraints Because microbial mats and shallow, supersaturated seas were necessary for the formation of this form of deposit, larger eukaryotic organisms could not survive in the regions in which these deposits were formed; hence the record is mainly restricted to bacteria.

After touring with Anna Pavlova's company, he and his wife, Xenia, settled in Australia where they established the Borovansky Ballet company. This company provided the foundation for modern ballet in Australia and was subsequently used as the basis for the first national Australian ballet company, The Australian Ballet which was established in 1962. Early years Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, c.1935 National Library of Australia Eduard Josef Sk≈ôeƒçek was born on 24 February 1902 in P≈ôerov, Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the seventh child of Franti≈°ek Sk≈ôeƒçek, a railway clerk, and his wife Arno≈°ta. After graduating school he worked as an accountant before he was called up for military service in the Czechoslovak Air Force. In 1921, he joined the chorus of the Olomouc Opera Company as a baritone, however as he had an early gymnastic training he was transferred to the corps de ballet. In September 1923 he successfully auditioned for the Prague National Theatre where he began to work his way up the hierarchy before he gained a place in Anna Pavlova's touring company in 1928. He began his career as a dancer of character roles by changing his name to Eduard Borowanski. He first performed with the Pavlova Ballet in Hamburg, Germany. He then toured for seasons in Britain, South America and Asia. He first toured Australia with the company in 1929. However, the company collapsed after the death of Anna Pavlova in 1930, and he and his companion, the Russian-born Xenia Nikolayevna Kr√ºger, n√©e Smirnova (1903‚Äì1985), scraped a living by teaching children in makeshift studios in Paris, then Prague and Berlin. He married Kr√ºger, a divorcee, on 14 October 1933 at the register office, Westminster, London. In 1932 he joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. His notable roles with this company were the Strong Man in Le Beau Danube, Polkan in Le Coq d'Or and the Shopkeeper of La Boutique fantasque. He revisited Australia in 1938 with the company, now renamed The Royal Covent Garden Russian Ballet, however he and his wife decided to remain in Australia at the end of the tour. Borovansky Ballet Ann MacKintosh as the Woman and Edouard Borovansky as the Man in Fantasy on Grieg's Concerto in A minor, Borovansky Ballet, c.1941, National Library of Australia After Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Borovansky and his wife Xenia felt that there was little future for ballet in the region and the outbreak of World War II a few months later gave them little incentive or opportunity to return to Europe. With his wife, he established a ballet school in Melbourne named the Melbourne Academy of Russian Ballet. Xenia was the principal teacher, while Borovansky handled the administration. By 1940 the academy had grown and Borovansky was able to establish the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, which held its first season at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne in December of that year. The principal dancer was Laurel Martyn. The ballet company was variously called the Borovansky Ballet, the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, the Borovansky Ballet of 40 and the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet. Borovansky had also encouraged the formation of the Melbourne Ballet Club, which displayed and encouraged new choreography. From 1940 his company presented studio performances for the Melbourne Ballet Club of original choreography by himself, Xenia Borovansky, Laurel Martyn and Dorothy Stevenson. Works choreographed and presented during this period include Martyn's Sigrid, Stevenson's Sea Legend (whose setting was designed by William Constable) and Martyn's En Saga. In 1942, Borovansky's company presented a five-night season at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne. The season was such a success that it convinced J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd that ballet \\"was potentially big business\\". Borovansky now had commercial backing and access to theatres across Australia. In return, his company was formed to provide commercial success. The backing of J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd was a turning-point, for without it the company would have died, similarly to the Sydney-based Kirsova Ballet (1941‚Äì44), which had refused commercial backing and collapsed despite an Australia-wide following. The company therefore performed \\"large, colourful, familiar works which were what 'the Firm' preferred\\". Borovansky was naturalised as a British subjectAt that time, there was no Australian citizenship; this came into existence only in January 1949. in 1944, becoming a well-known figure in Melbourne and \\"notorious for his despotic treatment of his dancers\\". In 1944, the 40-strong company had toured the mainland capitals, Tasmania and New Zealand with a repertoire that included Giselle, Swan Lake (Act II), Les Sylphides, En Saga, Capriccio Italien, Frederick Ashton's Fa√ßade, and Borovansky's symphonic fantasy, Vltava. In 1945, the company toured mainland Australia again. This tour included an 8-month season in Melbourne featuring the \\"tried favourites of pre-war 'Russian ballet'\\" ‚Äì Le Carnaval, Sch√©h√©razade and Le Beau Danube ‚Äì as well as a new work by Borovansky, Terra Australis. At the end of this season Laurel Martyn left the company to form, out of the original Melbourne Ballet Club, the Victorian Ballet Guild. Her choice of a small, experimental dance company over the glamorous professional stage highlighted the dilemma Borovansky faced. Borovansky had built a \\"strong, commercially attractive operation on the basis of the school run by his wife and a keen sense of what the public would pay to see\\". However, as his company was funded by J. C. Williamson's, they dictated what the company could do. Borovansky's company had expanded and now included such dancers as Paul Hammond, Martin Rubinstein, Leon Kellaway, Peggy Sager, Kathleen Gorham, Vassilie Trunoff and Edna Busse. For the next 18 months, the company (now called the Borovansky Ballet) became the dance-chorus for two operettas and toured New Zealand a second time while also holding seasons of Copp√©lia and other favourites. The company was disbanded in 1948 due to lack of financial backing. In 1951, Borovansky assembled a second company called the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet which was sponsored by the Education in Music and Dramatic Arts Society as well as J. C. Williamson's. He presented ambitious productions with the company such as a full-sized Petrouchka that year. While in 1952, he produced a complete Sleeping Princess. Seasons included L√©onide Massine's Symphonie Fantastique (1954), John Cranko's Pineapple Poll (1954) and David Lichine's full-length The Nutcracker (1955). During its 1957 season, it hosted guest artists from the Royal Ballet including Margot Fonteyn. Borovansky choreographed a number of works for his company. Some, like The Black Swan, Terra Australis and The Outlaw, were overtly Australian in theme. Later, choreographers who worked for him included company members Paul Grinwis and Robert Pomi√©. He also commissioned David Lichine to create an original ballet which premiered on 17 February 1956 as Corrida. Works Borovansky choreographed several works for his company. His first work, Vltava, premiered at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, on 9 December 1940 as part of the first season of the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company. Vltava was \\"patriotically Czech in music, theme and imagery\\" as it drew on his European heritage for inspiration. Borovansky choreographed this work to the symphonic poem M√° vlast by Czech composer Bed≈ôich Smetana. The Vltava is the longest river in the Czech Republic and thus the main role was named the Spirit of the River and was originally danced by Laurel Martyn. The main male roles of the Hunters were taken by Noel Neville, George Hale, Reg Bartram and Laurie Rentoul. In the original performances the music was played on two pianos by Marjorie Summers and Edna Bennet. According to the programme of the performance, Borovansky \\"endeavoured to express the spirit of the young Czechoslovakia\\". The cast wore white shorts and shirts for their costumes, which suggested that Borovansky was making a political statement on the nationalistic youth movements of Czechoslovakia with which he was familiar. The choreography was reminiscent of L√©onide Massine's Choreartium. This work remained in the repertoire of the company until at least 1945 when it was taken on tour to New Zealand. Borovansky's second ballet was Terra Australis, which is the first all-Australian ballet. It premiered in Melbourne on 25 May 1946, performed by his company. The ballet's libretto was by Tom Rothfield while the score was commissioned from Esther Rofe. The ballet focused on the subject of Australia's colonisation by white settlers. This was represented in the form of a love triangle where the virginal Spirit of Australia was courted by a white explorer and an Aboriginal lover. The original cast featured Peggy Sager as the Spirit of Australia, Martin Rubinstein as the Explorer and Vassilie Trunoff as the Aborigine. The ballet was restaged in 1947 with Kathleen Gorham as the new lead. Borovansky's next ballet, The Black Swan, also had an Australian theme. It was based on a historical incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet was the story of the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951. Death and legacy Borovansky died of a coronary occlusion on 18 December 1959 at Randwick, and was buried with Anglican rites in Box Hill Cemetery, Melbourne. He was survived by his wife; they had no children. His company provided the basis for the creation of a national Australian company. The artistic director of the Borovansky Ballet, Peggy van Praagh, founded the Australian Ballet in 1962. His dancers also provided the nucleus of the national ballet company ‚Äì including such dancers as Garth Welch, Robert Pomie, Jeffrey Kovel, Estella Nova and Rosemary Mildner. During his last season of Sleeping Princess, Marilyn Jones was hailed overnight as a ballerina. The Borovansky Ballet company was \\"both an intensely personal creation, where one man did almost everything, and a national ballet, eager to draw on whatever talent it could employ\\". On 21 March 1980 a gala tribute celebrating Borovansky's work as the founder of ballet in Australia was held at the Sydney Opera House. The programme consisted of Pineapple Poll, Sch√©h√©razade and Graduation Ball. He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Australian Dance Awards in 1999.

The mountain has an elevation of and is the tripoint between the valleys of Val Fedoz, Val Fex (both in Graub√ºnden) and Val Malenco (in Lombardy).  Geography  The Sassa di Fora, Piz Fora on CNS, is a massive and complex mountain located centrally on the Alpine chain, between the Valmalenco and Alta Engadina. It forms the final high elevations on the western side, and its summit is towered over by the Bernina Group; three distinct and slightly inclined ridges. The northwest face of these ridges make up the head of Val Fedoz and is usually by the Vadrec da Fedoz; a great glacial plateau below the summit. The northeastern side, also covered with ice, has a steeper incline than the west but face less impressive views, mainly, the Vadret dal G√ºz and Vadret da Fex which form the western summit of the Val Fex. On the south side lies the most impressive structure of the Bernina Group, the Gold Pass. From Fuorcla to Chap√ºtsch in the east, it spans 3 km and is more than 600 m high in some areas. Under the steep slopes of the Fora nozzle the only glacial extension of the southern slope is the small glacier, Sassa Fora. Expeditions to the summit of this beautiful mountain begin in Chiareggio in Valmalenco, or from Sils-Maria in the Engadin. Both routes have similar difficulties and travel times. The southern path has the advantage of being much more scenic and open while also reducing 300 meters in altitude, but it is more complex. In both cases, no footholds ease the long and tiring climb. The trek is appropriate only for well-trained climbers.  Report of the climb  * Top n ¬∞ 1846 * Rising slope: SW-W-SW * Difference of ascent: 1800 m - Total: 3600 m * Rise Time: 6.30 h - Total: 11.30 h * Recommended season: Summer  Climb  = Ascent = At Chiareggio the road leads to Passo del Muretto. A path shortens the route and partly follows the road to a junction. At this point, a detour leads to the Golden Alpe (q. 2010 m). An alpine pasture offers a panoramic facade of the north, named Accident and Monte del Forno, which briefly follows east leading to Val Nevasco. Continue a hundred meters north, leaving the path, into a sparse forest avoids the rocky prominence and steep slopes above them. At about (q. 2400 m) is Dosso Calvo, plateau pastureland east of the grassy spur. At the highest part of the plateau a grassy rib shape is to the left. It is steep and leads along the ridge of the hill above. The path becomes more evident from there. It turns to the left (W), and then enters into the wall. An easy 100 m channel of broken rocks leads to a logical easy path on the left (I ¬∞), in the direction of the now visible Golden step (q. 3083 m), from Furcela Fedoz on the CNS with a difficulty level of F. The pass leads onto the glacier (exhibiting numerous crevasses) losing a few tens of meters in altitude. Crossing towards the north, in the direction of the steep icy slope that connects the bottom of the hanging glacier with the plateau below the summit. The path moves to the right and follows a serac area, with slender bridges of ice and partition walls. The path continues in the direction of the mountain NNW ridge through the crevassed glacier. Next comes the plateau which turns towards the SSE and slopes gently, on a long traverse in the direction of a steep icy chute to the SW ridge. The bergschrund can create serious problems, in most cases, it towers to the right of a providential bridge. The icy slope climb spans up about fifty meters, at about 50/55 ¬∞. Crossing requires ice screws. This ends the difficult part of the journey and the broad SW ridge leaning slightly to the right, leads to the summit. = Descent = The plateau is accessible from the top edge of the ice chute by abseiling down the chute, continuing along the easy SW crest, passing the first projecting rock and ending down a shorter icy slope than the rising, further continuing along the SW ridge to the Gold Pass (normal route), using a guide of the CAI / TCI Monti of Italy: Bernina. In any case, the descent continues along the ascent itinerary.

Unlike the American weapon it appears to have had an ordinary high-explosive shell from the beginning. It was of conventional design, and was virtually a scaled-up 8 cm GrW 34. It broke down into the standard three loads for transport. The tube weighed , the baseplate and the bipod . Each could be man-packed for some distance, but small handcarts were issued for longer distances. Each mortar squad consisted of a squad leader, three gunners and three ammunition bearers. It was initially deployed in ( \\"smoke or fog-thrower\\") battalions belonging to the Chemical Corps of the Heer; exactly how the American initially fielded their own 4.2 inch mortar in chemical mortar battalions. From 1941 they were replaced by the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40 and the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher.  Operational use  Initially they were deployed in Nebelwerfer battalions numbered 1 to 9, plus the Nebel-Lehr Abteilung (Demonstration Battalion) and saw service in the Battle of France and Russia during Operation Barbarossa. Specialist units using these mortars were also formed, such as Gebirgs-Werfer-Abteilung (Mountain Mortar Battalion) 10 which was formed in Finland in early 1942 by expanding Nebelwerfer-Batterie 222., This had itself been converted from 8th Battery of Artillery Regiment 222 of the 181st Infantry Division during the invasion of Norway.

It owned by Merit Travel Group. It operates 19 locations in Canada, often on or near university and college campuses. \\"CUTS\\" was originally an acronym for \\"Canadian University Travel Service\\". The website is listed by TripSavvy as one of the 6 best for finding student airfares. History Travel CUTS had its origins in the 1950s with travel services offered by the now-defunct Canadian Union of Students (\\"CUS\\") through an unincorporated operation. After the CUS dissolved in 1969, a group of Ontario university student councils formed the Association of Ontario Student Councils, which took over the operation of the student travel service. In the next few years, the Association of Ontario Student Councils expanded across Canada and came to be called the Association of Students' Councils (\\"AOSC\\"). Travelcuts was founded with the purpose of providing discounted travel and International Student Identity Cards to students. Under its original ownership, travelcuts was operated as a hybrid commercial enterprise and non-profit organization. It has since expanded to serve the general public as well. In 2014, the on campus locations of travelcuts were re-branded to join the flagship retail travel brand, Merit Travel. Travelcuts became a full service travel call centre and online travel agency. As a result of legislation passed by the Canadian government requiring airline tickets to be sold through travel agents, in 1974 the AOSC incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, \\"Canadian University Travel Services Limited\\" (\\"CUTS\\"). In 1979, CUTS established its \\"Student Work Abroad Program\\" (\\"SWAP\\"), which is still in operation. SWAP assists students to obtain the necessary documentation to travel and work in foreign countries. In 1981, the Canadian Federation of Students (\\"CFS\\") was founded and replaced a large number of provincial and national student organizations. After its creation, CFS incorporated a separate division, CFS-Services, which took over operation of the services previously operated by the AOSC, including CUTS. At that time, CUTS adopted the trade-name \\"Travel CUTS\\". In 1996, the University of Western Ontario University Students' Council initiated a lawsuit against CFS-Services, alleging that it illegally transferred assets from the AOSC to itself at a 1987 meeting. The student societies of three other universities (Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, Queen's Alma Mater Society and University of Alberta Students' Union) later joined the suit as co-plaintiffs. In March 2006, the parties settled the action out of court, resulting in the plaintiffs acquiring a minority interest of the shares of Travel CUTS and two seats on its board of directors. As a result, the CFS held 76% of the shares and the Canadian Student Horizons Group (the plaintiff student groups) held 24%. Travel CUTS went into receivership on October 23, 2009 and several offices in Canada closed. On October 26, 2009, Merit Travel Group, a privately held Canadian travel company, purchased Travel CUTS.

White, Presentaci√≥n, Retrieved January 25, 2011. They were published in Spain between 1953 and 1958 (first part) and 1973 and 1978 (second part) in the Luchadores del Espacio collection by Editorial Valenciana and they appeared under the pseudonym George H. White. It received the European SF Award for Best Cycle of Novels at the Eurocon in Brussels in 1978. The work represents a Spanish equivalent of science fiction and space opera that populated North American pulp fiction in the nineteen thirties and forties, a trend in which were forged such great authors as E.E. Doc Smith, Jack Williamson and Edmond Hamilton. The series has an adventurous nature and nostalgia for a bygone era. It contains a distinctly epic war and all kinds of adventures, while collecting a certain respect for science and technology which are not as battered as other works of that time. Likely having copied the term orbimotor from Jose Elola, a.k.a. Colonel Ignotus, it non-the-less contains the aesthetics of Alex Raymond's, Flash Gordon: the prose is very visual. Engu√≠danos had a special interest in Mongo-styled planets, with its mix of future and archaic, feudal regimes, princes and lords despotic, primitive peoples oppressed, and, of course, men of silicon, insect men, floor men, or fish men. Engu√≠danos' early works reflected classical space-opera, but very soon the Saga of Aznar was leading towards a unique epic among the stars, with a trace of classical myths. If Aeneas escaped from destroyed Troy to cross a sea unknown and found a distant colony which would be the birthplace of an empire, Rome and the first Aznar lead the survivors of the invasion of Earth by an alien species to a distant star to rebuild the lost homeland, Inci thereby in the collective ownership of the people valerano (Valera, an original 'autoplaneta') were heirs of mankind. Engu√≠danos' series is likely of a number unparalleled in all of science fiction. In Saga, futuristic technology meets a very specific logic and originality: 'metal hyperdensity that repels the gravity low electric induction', ships that simulate cetacean space forms, the sidereal armed with millions of ships in battle over the fate of mankind, Z-rays, \\"sunlight\\" as a lethal weapon or as interstellar propellant, and the fabulous machines Karendon (inclusive of the field as the famous Star Trek transporters but brought here to their logical conclusion). Beyond the adventures of war and futurism, Saga is also a very comprehensive utopian science fiction. A future society where the players have all the elements that characterize it as utopian, where money has been eliminated and automation has freed the human race from work. But in utopias of science fiction things are not so placid and well run; the island of Utopia (the Earth's future or any of its stellar colonies, including such wandering colony which is the fabulous autoplaneta Valera) is subjected to terrible dangers and frightening threats. Saga stresses a realistic treatment of the characters: Unlike other series, the protagonists of the Saga not only live their lives in fullness of adventure and excitement, but also are born and die as in real life. The novels allow the reader to accompany the vicissitudes of mankind through family members of the first protagonist (the aviator Miguel Angel Aznar de Soto), who is thrown from the contemporary period, after an adventure in search of 'flying saucers' in the Himalayas, to an unlikely but highly suggestive Venus' Jurassic, and finally to five centuries in the future with the Earth on the brink of a dreadful World War and the shadow of an even more horrific alien invasion looming. Step by step, without giving rest to the suffering humanity, Engu√≠danos describes the vicissitudes of future exiles from the land, citizens of the Federation Ibero, who manage to escape the invasion of the \\"abominable gray beast, thorbod\\". Pascual Engu√≠danos not only achieved a long series of novels, but managed to keep a cycle of tension and growing interest, by constantly evolving the plot and characters. Engu√≠danos, with ups and downs in the 'normal' range, managed to maintain and even improve the quality as the Saga progressed.

The canyon is located within the Black Hills, located on the northern edge of the Black Hills National Forest. The Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway travels through the Canyon from Spearfish to Cheyenne Crossing along U.S. Route 14A. The highway follows an old railroad grade that was abandoned after massive flooding in 1933. Natural history Roughlock Falls Nature Area Approximately 600 million years ago in the Precambrian, the area was covered by a sea. As waters subsided and land masses began to appear 60 to 30 million years ago (between the Paleocene and Oligocene epochs), drainages such as Spearfish Canyon formed as softer rock was eroded away. Today, a National Scenic Byway, U.S. Highway 14A, winds through the canyon. This area is truly a crossroads, and trees and plants from Rocky Mountains, eastern woodlands, northern forests, and the Great Plains areas can be found here. Flora and fauna Of the 1,585 plant species found in South Dakota, 1,260 species are in the Black Hills, many of which can be found in Spearfish Canyon. Ponderosa pines are the most prominent vegetation in the Black Hills. As for bird species, turkeys, bluejays, woodpeckers, cliff swallows, chickadees, and golden or bald eagles are seen in the area. The canyon supports a cross- section of four-footed animal life. White-tail and mule deer can be found throughout the drive. Porcupines, raccoons, squirrels, and chipmunks might be spotted as well as a bobcat or a yellow-bellied marmot. Geology It is often studied by geologists due to the extreme old age of the Precambrian rocks exposed by the creek bed. The canyon's high walls are of three dominant rock types. The Cambrian to Ordovician Deadwood Shale at the bottom lies on an unconformity above Precambrian rock and can be identified by its brown color. It is multi-layered in appearance and ranges from 10 to 400 feet thick. Englewood Limestone in the middle is pink to red colored and is 30 to 60 feet thick. The Paleogene Paha Sapa Limestone, the top layer, is the thickest (300 to 600 feet) and is buff-colored and weathered gray in appearance. Caves and fossils are frequently found in the Paha Sapa Limestone.

The Working Men's Party in New York was a political party founded in April 1829 in New York City. After a promising debut in the fall election of 1829, in which one of the party's candidates was elected to the New York State Assembly, the party rapidly disintegrated into factionalism and discord, vanishing from the scene in 1831. The New York Working Men's Party was one of a number of short-lived independent workingmen's parties which simultaneously emerged in Philadelphia, Boston, and many other urban centers of the United States during the period 1828 to 1832. History =Background= In the late 1820s, corruption was rampant in the municipal administration of New York City. Public services like street lighting, were rendered by friends of the politicians who got monopolies for almost no payment to the city. \\"Charter dealers\\", among them Samuel B. Romaine, bribed assemblymen in Albany to get a large number of banks chartered. These banks issued their own currency with which working men were paid but which was not well accepted by the commerce, and devaluated quickly. Contractors built houses, but did not pay the workers after delivering the house, without consequences. A reform movement had also emerged, with the organized agitation of the trade unions of New York City leading to the adoption on a citywide basis of the 10-hour working day, replacing the former 11-hour standard.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 1: From Colonial Times to the Founding of the American Federation of Labor. New York: International Publishers, 1947; pg. 130. In an effort to avert a return to the longer working day, a mass meeting of \\"mechanics and others\\" was held on April 23, 1829.Frank T. Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City: 1829-1831,\\" Political Science Quarterly, vol. 22, no. 3 (Sept. 1907), pg. 402. The mass meeting passed a resolution promising not to work past the current \\"just and reasonable\\" 10 hour standard and indicating that the names of violators of this restriction would have their names published in the press as enemies of labor. A strike fund was also collected. An organizational meeting followed on April 28, at which a so- called Committee of Fifty elected to coordinate what was believed to be a forthcoming strike action. =Convention= This strike was not to be, however, as the city's employers abruptly ended their plan to impose an extension of the working day. This capitulation did not end the Committee of Fifty, however, with the erstwhile strike committee instead submitting a report late in the summer of 1829 calling for establishment of a political party of the workers to contest the forthcoming fall elections. This report was accepted by another mass meeting and the New York Working Men's Party was born, following the precedent established the previous year by the organized labor movement of Philadelphia. Chief among Committee of Fifty was a 39-year old machinist named Thomas E. Skidmore (1790-1832), who authored most of the group's resolutions for the electoral campaign.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 1, pg. 131. Skidmore also presided over a convention held at Military Hall in New York City on October 19, 1829, at which a set of resolutions, largely authored by Skidmore, was passed. The party program of 1829 called for the grant of 160 acres of land to every man and to every unmarried woman over age 21, to be held perpetually until the owner's death. All land holdings in excess of 160 acres were to be confiscated by the government for redistribution, according to the Skidmore-authored party resolution. The party also adopted resolutions against the hereditary transmission of wealth and against exclusive privileges and monopolies. Bankers were denounced as \\"the greatest knaves, impostors and paupers of the age.\\" The program also called for a program of communal education of children, a plank favored by one of the secretaries of the Working Men's Party, Robert Dale Owen (1801-1877), son of the utopian communalist pioneer Robert Owen.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 403. The new party named a slate of candidates for the November elections, including representatives of a variety of trades for seats in the New York State Assembly.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 1, pp. 130-131. The new party engaged in political fusion with organizes seeking to defeat Tammany Hall in races for the New York State Senate. At the end of October 1829 a weekly newspaper was launched in support of the new labor political movement, the Working Man's Advocate, published by the English-born George Henry Evans (1805-1856), a self-described \\"mechanic.\\"Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pp. 403-404. =Election of 1829= The Working Men's Party put forward a full slate of candidates for the New York State Assembly in the November election of 1829.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 404. These included a number of working men from the bench, including two machinists, two carpenters, a cooper, a printer, a painter, and a silversmith, among others. On a very short timetable between its formation, nomination of candidates, and the fall election, the candidates of the Working Men's Party performed acceptably well in a three-way race with the Democratic Party dominated by Tammany Hall and the National Republicans. Final results showed the Tammany Democrats winning 8 of 11 contested legislative seats, the National Republicans winning 2, and one candidate of the Working Men's Party emerging victorious ‚Äî Ebenezer Ford, President of the Journeymen Carpenters Society.Robert W. Reid, Washington Lodge, No. 21, F. & A.M., and Some of Its Members. Washington Lodge, 1911. In the simultaneous elections for citywide office, the Working Men's Party received about 6,000 votes to Tammany Hall's 11,000, helping to stymie Tammany from gaining an outright majority in the Common Council. =Reaction= The emergence of the fledgling organized workers' movement in the electoral process represented a threat to the leaders of the established political parties, who attempted to appropriate for themselves some of the reform measures garnering broad popular support. In January 1830, a bill for the better security of mechanics and other laborers of New York City was introduced in the State Assembly by Silas M. Stilwell. The Tammany men immediately took it up as if it were their own, voted for it, and secured the credit of its adoption, when it became a law. Among other things, it required, under penalties, the owner of a building to retain from the contractor the amount to be paid to the workers. =Factionalism= Although Thomas Skidmore had managed to push some of his favored ideas calling for a redistribution of property into the 1829 platform of the Working Men's Party, his ideas were regarded by primary rival Robert Dale Owen as \\"crude and impractical\\" and his personal political style reckoned as \\"somewhat overbearing and dictatorial.\\"Robert Dale Owen, in Free Enquirer, March 20, 1830, cited in Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 405. Only a minority supported Skidmore's radical ideas about expropriating and evenly dividing property, a minority favored the education- based humanitarian appeal of Owen, Wright, and Evans.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 405. As the year 1829 drew to a close, a meeting of \\"mechanics and other workingmen\\" was held in New York City on December 29 to set the future policy of the party. The meeting was chaired by prominent local politician and Skidmore foe Henry G. Guyon, who refused to allow Skidmore to speak. When Skidmore attempted to address the meeting without official sanction, he was howled down. Skidmore's agrarianism-oriented program was defeated and the communal education policies given primacy in the revised Working Men's Party program, with class differentiation and the denial of political liberty to working people directly connected to the current pedagogical model. Denied access to the floor at the December 29, 1829, meeting and thereby effectively \\"read out\\" of the party,Edward Pessen, Most Uncommon Jacksonians: The Radical Leaders of the Early Labor Movement. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1967; pg. 62. Thomas Skidmore and his co-thinkers called a preparatory meeting soon thereafter, with a formal organizational meeting for a new political organization following on February 23, 1830.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 406. About 40 party adherents were in attendance to hear a long argument between Skidmore and Working Man's Advocate publisher Evans in which Skidmore charged that the official party had come to be dominated by the wealthy, while Evans accused Skidmore of having made himself \\"obnoxious to the great body of workingmen.\\" A May 19, 1830, meeting of the 70-member General Executive Committee of the Working Men's Party dealt a blow both to the Skidmore and Owen-Evans factions, however, granting to party members \\"the free enjoyment of their own private opinions on all subjects\\" while simultaneously asserting \\"never to support any attempt to palm upon any man, or set of men, the peculiar doctrines of infidelity, agrarianism or sectarian principles,\\" dismissing both the equal distribution of property and communal boarding and clothing of children in favor of maintenance of the traditional family unit.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 407. This was followed by another meeting one week later, at which the majority belong to the Owen-Evans group.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 408. Those dissenting from the communal boarding school educational model were expelled. The Working Men's Party was thereby formally split. Evans editorialized upon the situation in the pages of his Working Man's Advocate, attributing the split to a \\"deliberate plot that has been lately unmasked\\" to subvert the Working Men's Party to the cause of electing National Republican orator Henry Clay as President of the United States.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 409. =Elections of 1830 and demise= The majority of the Working Men's Party identified as members of the \\"Clay Workingmen,\\" whether through personal admiration for their banner-bearer, belief in a protective tariff as a fundamental matter of policy, or sheer opportunism in seeking to use the political movement for personal ends.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 411. The Owen-Evans Working Men's Party, a minority at the time of the May 1830 split, attempted to persevere with the party's communal education-oriented program and nominated a full ticket for the local election, including an effort to return Ebenezer Ford to the legislative assembly. The field was joined by Thomas Skidmore's Agrarian Party, which also called itself the \\"Original Working Men's Party,\\" which nominated a full ticket for state and city office as well, including running Skidmore for United States Congress and his right hand man, Alexander Ming, Sr., tapped for State Assembly.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 412. The party nominated an individual from Orange County for governor, but he decline and no replacement was chosen. The result of the 1830 election was a crushing blow for the Owens-Evans Working Men's Party and the Skidmore Agrarian Party alike, with the Working Men's candidate for Governor, Ezekiel Williams, winning just 2,332 votes against the nearly 250,000 votes split by the Democratic and National Republican candidates. Tammany Democrats routed the National Republican proxy \\"Clay Workingmen\\" in legislative races, with Ebenezer Ford garnering only 2,329 votes in his losing bid for re-election, barely more than a third of his 1829 total. With the majority of its adherents absorbed into mainstream politics and no radicals elected, the Working Men's Party movement quickly expired.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pg. 401. There is anecdotal evidence that it continue to exist into the early part of 1831 but all traces of its existence vanish from the historical record by the time of the 1831 New York City elections.Carlton, \\"The Workingmen's Party of New York City,\\" pp. 412-413.

He founded and is the chair of BC Rivers Day and World Rivers Day. In 2009, Angelo was appointed as the inaugural chair of the Rivers Institute at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) Prior to that, he was the long-time head of the Fish, Wildlife and Recreation Program at BCIT. Angelo has received the Order of British Columbia and the Order of Canada in recognition of his river conservation efforts. In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University for his river conservation work both locally and globally.  Career  Angelo graduated from the University of Montana, and then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. He was involved in numerous river conservation and restoration initiatives including restoring heavily damaged urban streams such as Guichon Creek in Burnaby and Still Creek in Vancouver. In the early 2000s, he was involved in cleaning up Britannia Creek, which in 2011 saw salmon return for the first time in a century. In September 1980, Angelo organized a major cleanup of the Thompson River in the southern interior of British Columbia. The event later became known as BC Rivers Day. In 2005, Angelo helped set up the World River Day, a now annual event on the final Sunday in September, celebrated by millions people in more than 60 countries. Angelo has traveled on hundreds of waterways, including the Zambezi, Nile, Mekong, Amazon, and Yangtze. From 2003 to 2007, he hosted the National Geographic on-line program, \\"Riverworld; a personal journey to the world's wildest rivers\\"; in 2008, he launched his follow-up program, Wild Water, Wild Earth, with presentations across North America. In late November 2011, Angelo announced his retirement from full-time work and was honored with the title, Chair Emeritus of the Rivers Institute. In 2012, the City of Burnaby honored Angelo by naming a local city stream, Angelo Creek, after him. In 2014, the 40,000 member BC Wildlife Federation presented Angelo with the Barsby Award, the highest honor their organization can bestow, in recognition of Angelo‚Äôs lifelong efforts to protect waterways. Angelo was also installed into the Fraser River Hall of Fame at a gala event hosted by the Fraser River Discovery Center. In 2015, he was named as one of Canada's 100 greatest modern day explorers by Canadian Geographic magazine. In 2016, the feature film documentary, RiverBlue, chronicled Angelo‚Äôs three year around-the-world journey by river from 2012 to 2015 during which he uncovered and documented the extensive freshwater pollution impacts of the global fashion industry. The film was praised for its efforts to make the fashion industry more sustainable and ethical. RiverBlue went on to win several international awards including best documentary feature at the United Kingdom‚Äôs largest independent film festival, Raindance. RiverBlue was also honored at the 2018 World Water Forum in Brasilia, the world‚Äôs largest water- related gathering, receiving both the AFD Best Film Award and the prestigious Green Drop Award honoring the film from 2017 that best promoted sustainability. In the fall of 2017, Angelo traveled along the Tijuana River from Mexico into California documenting cross border pollution issues as the lead subject for an ABC news investigative story by ABC 10 news anchor, Kimberly Hunt. While sewage pollution in the river had been previously documented, Angelo‚Äôs work was among the first to document the extent of toxic industrial pollution plaguing the river, much of it stemming from Tijuana‚Äôs manufacturing plants of which many are US owned. The news feature was subsequently nominated for a 2018 Emmy Award.  Positions  Angelo served as a past Chair and inaugural member of the Pacific Fisheries Resource Conservation Council. In addition, Angelo also served as the first non- government provincial representative and Chair of the Canadian Heritage Rivers Board. He was also the inaugural Chair of the BC Heritage River System from 1997 to 2001, and from 1998 to 2000, Angelo was chaired the BC Park Legacy Panel. As long time Rivers Chair for the Outdoor Recreation Council of BC, Angelo also coordinated the compilation of BC's annual \\"most endangered rivers\\" list from its inception in 1993 to 2018. The compilation of this list, done in concert with the 100,000 member Outdoor Recreation Council of British Columbia, helps provide important profile for a number of key river issues across the Province. Angelo is a Fellow International member of the New York- based Explorers Club as well as a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. In October 2011, Angelo was awarded a special lifetime achievement award by the BCIT Alumni and Foundation, and in November 2011, Angelo was also presented with the 'Land Champion Award' by the Real Estate Foundation of BC.  Personal life  Angelo is the son of Australian born actress Shirley Ann Richards, and Edmond Angelo. Angelo and his wife Kathie have two daughters, Kelly and Lindsay, and two grandchildren, Tucker and Grey.

From the Italian side, the pass can be reached by car from the nearby Livigno, and from the Swiss side this is the road from the Bernina pass. From the east side, there is a route that starts at some lower point at Campacciolo di Sopra (1910 m), closer to Livigno. Another route from the Italian side is again from the road to Forcola, from Valle della Forcola. From the Swiss side, the route goes up the Val da Fain in the east direction to the Passo del Fieno where it joins the other described routes.

Beecher published three papers describing a trilobite larval form, trilobite limbs and trilobite ventral anatomy from material collected from the site he established. Beecher died unexpectedly in 1904; much material, as well as details of the location, was lost. Research was subsequently limited to study of material collected during the original excavations that had been distributed to various institutions. Amateur fossil collectors Tom E. Whiteley (also responsible for rediscovering the Walcott-Rust quarry) and Dan Cooper rediscovered the location in 1984 and from 1985 academic excavations and studies (re)-commenced.

Microbial mats grow at interfaces between different types of material, mostly on submerged or moist surfaces, but a few survive in deserts. They colonize environments ranging in temperature from ‚Äì40 ¬∞C to 120 ¬∞C. A few are found as endosymbionts of animals. Although only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species. In moist conditions mats are usually held together by slimy substances secreted by the microorganisms. In many cases some of the bacteria form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites, but there are also spherical forms. Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good fossil evidence, from , and have been the most important members and maintainers of the planet's ecosystems. Originally they depended on hydrothermal vents for energy and chemical \\"food\\", but the development of photosynthesis allow mats to proliferate outside of these environments by utilizing a more widely available energy source, sunlight. The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are carbon dioxide and water. As a result, microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans. Because of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as \\"food\\", there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution. Description Stromatolites are formed by some microbial mats as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment. Microbial mats may also be referred to as algal mats and bacterial mats. They are a type of biofilm that is large enough to see with the naked eye and robust enough to survive moderate physical stresses. These colonies of bacteria form on surfaces at many types of interface, for example between water and the sediment or rock at the bottom, between air and rock or sediment, between soil and bed-rock, etc. Such interfaces form vertical chemical gradients, i.e. vertical variations in chemical composition, which make different levels suitable for different types of bacteria and thus divide microbial mats into layers, which may be sharply defined or may merge more gradually into each other. A variety of microbes are able to transcend the limits of diffusion by using \\"nanowires\\" to shuttle electrons from their metabolic reactions up to two centimetres deep in the sediment ‚Äì for example, electrons can be transferred from reactions involving hydrogen sulfide deeper within the sediment to oxygen in the water, which acts as an electron acceptor. The best-known types of microbial mat may be flat laminated mats, which form on approximately horizontal surfaces, and stromatolites, stubby pillars built as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment deposited on them by water. However, there are also spherical mats, some on the outside of pellets of rock or other firm material and others inside spheres of sediment. =Structure= A microbial mat consists of several layers, each of which is dominated by specific types of microorganism, mainly bacteria. Although the composition of individual mats varies depending on the environment, as a general rule the by-products of each group of microorganisms serve as \\"food\\" for other groups. In effect each mat forms its own food chain, with one or a few groups at the top of the food chain as their by-products are not consumed by other groups. Different types of microorganism dominate different layers based on their comparative advantage for living in that layer. In other words, they live in positions where they can out-perform other groups rather than where they would absolutely be most comfortable ‚Äî ecological relationships between different groups are a combination of competition and co-operation. Since the metabolic capabilities of bacteria (what they can \\"eat\\" and what conditions they can tolerate) generally depend on their phylogeny (i.e. the most closely related groups have the most similar metabolisms), the different layers of a mat are divided both by their different metabolic contributions to the community and by their phylogenetic relationships. In a wet environment where sunlight is the main source of energy, the uppermost layers are generally dominated by aerobic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (blue-green bacteria whose color is caused by their having chlorophyll), while the lowest layers are generally dominated by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria. Sometimes there are intermediate (oxygenated only in the daytime) layers inhabited by facultative anaerobic bacteria. For example, in hypersaline ponds near Guerrero Negro (Mexico) various kind of mats were explored. There are some mats with a middle purple layer inhabited by photosynthesizing purple bacteria.Lucas J. Stal: Physiological ecology of cyanobacteria in microbial mats and other communities, New Phytologist (1995), 131, 1‚Äì32 Some other mats have a white layer inhabited by chemotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria and beneath them an olive layer inhabited by photosynthesizing green sulfur bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria.Garcia-Pichel F., Mechling M., Castenholz R.W., Diel Migrations of Microorganisms within a Benthic, Hypersaline Mat Community, Appl. and Env. Microbiology, May 1994, pp. 1500‚Äì1511 However, this layer structure is not changeless during a day: some species of cyanobacteria migrate to deeper layers at morning, and go back at evening, to avoid intensive solar light and UV radiation at mid-day.Bebout B.M., Garcia-Pichel F., UV B-Induced Vertical Migrations of Cyanobacteria in a Microbial Mat, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Dec 1995, 4215‚Äì4222, Vol 61, No. 12 Microbial mats are generally held together and bound to their substrates by slimy extracellular polymeric substances which they secrete. In many cases some of the bacteria form filaments (threads), which tangle and thus increase the colonies' structural strength, especially if the filaments have sheaths (tough outer coverings). This combination of slime and tangled threads attracts other microorganisms which become part of the mat community, for example protozoa, some of which feed on the mat-forming bacteria, and diatoms, which often seal the surfaces of submerged microbial mats with thin, parchment-like coverings. Marine mats may grow to a few centimeters in thickness, of which only the top few millimeters are oxygenated. =Types of environment colonized= Underwater microbial mats have been described as layers that live by exploiting and to some extent modifying local chemical gradients, i.e. variations in the chemical composition. Thinner, less complex biofilms live in many sub-aerial environments, for example on rocks, on mineral particles such as sand, and within soil. They have to survive for long periods without liquid water, often in a dormant state. Microbial mats that live in tidal zones, such as those found in the Sippewissett salt marsh, often contain a large proportion of similar microorganisms that can survive for several hours without water. Microbial mats and less complex types of biofilm are found at temperature ranges from ‚Äì40 ¬∞C to +120 ¬∞C, because variations in pressure affect the temperatures at which water remains liquid. They even appear as endosymbionts in some animals, for example in the hindguts of some echinoids. =Ecological and geological importance= Wrinkled Kinneyia-type sedimentary structures formed beneath cohesive microbial mats in peritidal zones. The image shows the location, in the Burgsvik beds of Sweden, where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat. Kinneyia-like structure in the Grimsby Formation (Silurian) exposed in Niagara Gorge, New York Blister-like microbial mat on ripple-marked surface of a Cambrian tidal flat at Blackberry Hill, Wisconsin Microbial mats use all of the types of metabolism and feeding strategy that have evolved on Earth‚Äîanoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis; anaerobic and aerobic chemotrophy (using chemicals rather than sunshine as a source of energy); organic and inorganic respiration and fermentation (i..e converting food into energy with and without using oxygen in the process); autotrophy (producing food from inorganic compounds) and heterotrophy (producing food only from organic compounds, by some combination of predation and detritivory). Most sedimentary rocks and ore deposits have grown by a reef-like build-up rather than by \\"falling\\" out of the water, and this build-up has been at least influenced and perhaps sometimes caused by the actions of microbes. Stromatolites, bioherms (domes or columns similar internally to stromatolites) and biostromes (distinct sheets of sediment) are among such microbe-influenced build-ups. Other types of microbial mat have created wrinkled \\"elephant skin\\" textures in marine sediments, although it was many years before these textures were recognized as trace fossils of mats. Microbial mats have increased the concentration of metal in many ore deposits, and without this it would not be feasible to mine them‚Äîexamples include iron (both sulfide and oxide ores), uranium, copper, silver and gold deposits. Role in the history of life =The earliest mats= Microbial mats are among the oldest clear signs of life, as microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) formed have been found in western Australia. At that early stage the mats' structure may already have been similar to that of modern mats that do not include photosynthesizing bacteria. It is even possible that non-photosynthesizing mats were present as early as . If so, their energy source would have been hydrothermal vents (high-pressure hot springs around submerged volcanoes), and the evolutionary split between bacteria and archea may also have occurred around this time. ‚Äì abstract with link to free full content (PDF) The earliest mats were probably small, single-species biofilms of chemotrophs that relied on hydrothermal vents to supply both energy and chemical \\"food\\". Within a short time (by geological standards) the build-up of dead microorganisms would have created an ecological niche for scavenging heterotrophs, possibly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms that would have formed new layers in the mats and enriched their supply of biologically useful chemicals. =Photosynthesis= It is generally thought that photosynthesis, the biological generation of energy from light, evolved shortly after (3 billion). However an isotope analysis suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis may have been widespread as early as . The eminent researcher into Earth's earliest life, William Schopf, argues that, if one did not know their age, one would classify some of the fossil organisms in Australian stromatolites from as cyanobacteria, which are oxygen-producing photosynthesizers. There are several different types of photosynthetic reaction, and analysis of bacterial DNA indicates that photosynthesis first arose in anoxygenic purple bacteria, while the oxygenic photosynthesis seen in cyanobacteria and much later in plants was the last to evolve. The earliest photosynthesis may have been powered by infra-red light, using modified versions of pigments whose original function was to detect infra-red heat emissions from hydrothermal vents. The development of photosynthetic energy generation enabled the microorganisms first to colonize wider areas around vents and then to use sunlight as an energy source. The role of the hydrothermal vents was now limited to supplying reduced metals into the oceans as a whole rather than being the main supporters of life in specific locations. Heterotrophic scavengers would have accompanied the photosynthesizers in their migration out of the \\"hydrothermal ghetto\\". The evolution of purple bacteria, which do not produce or use oxygen but can tolerate it, enabled mats to colonize areas that locally had relatively high concentrations of oxygen, which is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it. Microbial mats would have been separated into oxidized and reduced layers, and this specialization would have increased their productivity. It may be possible to confirm this model by analyzing the isotope ratios of both carbon and sulfur in sediments laid down in shallow water. The last major stage in the evolution of microbial mats was the appearance of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizers which both produce and use oxygen. This gave undersea mats their typical modern structure: an oxygen-rich top layer of cyanobacteria; a layer of photosynthesizing purple bacteria that could tolerate oxygen; and oxygen-free, H2S-dominated lower layers of heterotrophic scavengers, mainly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms. It is estimated that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic reactions require a reducing agent, but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses water as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the top layers of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the chemotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes. Oxygenic photosynthesis in microbial mats would also have increased the free oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, both directly by emitting oxygen and because the mats emitted molecular hydrogen (H2), some of which would have escaped from the Earth's atmosphere before it could re-combine with free oxygen to form more water. Microbial mats thus played a major role in the evolution of organisms which could first tolerate free oxygen and then use it as an energy source. Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it, but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen-adapted organisms ‚Äî for example anaerobic fermentation produces a net yield of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate, cells' internal \\"fuel\\", per molecule of glucose, while aerobic respiration produces a net yield of 36. The oxygenation of the atmosphere was a prerequisite for the evolution of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, from which all multicellular organisms are built. Cyanobacteria have the most complete biochemical \\"toolkits\\" of all the mat-forming organisms: the photosynthesis mechanisms of both green bacteria and purple bacteria; oxygen production; and the Calvin cycle, which converts carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and sugars. It is likely that they acquired many of these sub-systems from existing mat organisms, by some combination of horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiosis followed by fusion. Whatever the causes, cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of the mat organisms and were well-adapted to strike out on their own both as floating mats and as the first of the phytoplankton, which forms the basis of most marine food chains. =Origin of eukaryotes= The time at which eukaryotes first appeared is still uncertain: there is reasonable evidence that fossils dated between and represent eukaryotes, but the presence of steranes in Australian shales may indicate that eukaryotes were present . There is still debate about the origins of eukaryotes, and many of the theories focus on the idea that a bacterium first became an endosymbiont of an anaerobic archean and then fused with it to become one organism. If such endosymbiosis was an important factor, microbial mats would have encouraged it. There are two possible variations of this scenario: *The boundary between the oxygenated and oxygen-free zones of a mat would have moved up when photosynthesis shut down at night and back down when photosynthesis resumed after the next sunrise. Symbiosis between independent aerobic and anaerobic organisms would have enabled both to live comfortably in the zone that was subject to oxygen \\"tides\\", and subsequent endosymbiosis would have made such partnerships more mobile. *The initial partnership may have been between anaerobic archea that required molecular hydrogen (H2) and heterotrophic bacteria that produced it and could live both with and without oxygen. = Life on land = Microbial mats from ~ provide the first evidence of life in the terrestrial realm. =The earliest multicellular \\"animals\\"= The Ediacara biota are the earliest widely accepted evidence of multicellular \\"animals\\". Most Ediacaran strata with the \\"elephant skin\\" texture characteristic of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils are hardly ever found in beds that do not contain these microbial mats. Adolf Seilacher categorized the \\"animals\\" as: \\"mat encrusters\\", which were permanently attached to the mat; \\"mat scratchers\\", which grazed the surface of the mat without destroying it; \\"mat stickers\\", suspension feeders that were partially embedded in the mat; and \\"undermat miners\\", which burrowed underneath the mat and fed on decomposing mat material. =The Cambrian substrate revolution= In the Early Cambrian, however, organisms began to burrow vertically for protection or food, breaking down the microbial mats, and thus allowing water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface and kill the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms in the lower layers. As a result of this Cambrian substrate revolution, marine microbial mats are confined to environments in which burrowing is non-existent or negligible: very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which are uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats; rocky \\"floors\\" which the burrowers cannot penetrate; the depths of the oceans, where burrowing activity today is at a similar level to that in the shallow coastal seas before the revolution. =Current status= Although the Cambrian substrate revolution opened up new niches for animals, it was not catastrophic for microbial mats, but it did greatly reduce their extent. How microbial mats help paleontologists Most fossils preserve only the hard parts of organisms, e.g. shells. The rare cases where soft-bodied fossils are preserved (the remains of soft-bodied organisms and also of the soft parts of organisms for which only hard parts such as shells are usually found) are extremely valuable because they provide information about organisms that are hardly ever fossilized and much more information than is usually available about those for which only the hard parts are usually preserved. Microbial mats help to preserve soft-bodied fossils by: *Capturing corpses on the sticky surfaces of mats and thus preventing them from floating or drifting away. *Physically protecting them from being eaten by scavengers and broken up by burrowing animals, and protecting fossil-bearing sediments from erosion. For example, the speed of water current required to erode sediment bound by a mat is 20‚Äì30 times as great as the speed required to erode a bare sediment. *Preventing or reducing decay both by physically screening the remains from decay-causing bacteria and by creating chemical conditions that are hostile to decay-causing bacteria. *Preserving tracks and burrows by protecting them from erosion. Many trace fossils date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them and thus improve paleontologists' estimates of when animals with these capabilities first appeared. Industrial uses The ability of microbial mat communities to use a vast range of \\"foods\\" has recently led to interest in industrial uses. There have been trials of microbial mats for purifying water, both for human use and in fish farming, and studies of their potential for cleaning up oil spills. As a result of the growing commercial potential, there have been applications for and grants of patents relating to the growing, installation and use of microbial mats, mainly for cleaning up pollutants and waste products.; ; cites U.S. Patents 7351005 and 7374670 See also * Biological soil crust * Cambrian substrate revolution * Cyanobacteria * Ediacaran type preservation * Evolutionary history of life * Sippewissett Microbial Mat Notes References * Seckbach S (2010) Microbial Mats: Modern and Ancient Microorganisms in Stratified Systems Springer, .

Only gross morphological information is preserved (unlike Orsten type phosphate replacement), although the fossils are compressed some relief is preserved (unlike Burgess Shale type preservation). The pyrite formed in voids left when soft tissue had decayed, and the tough exoskeleton formed a cavity which could be filled by euhedral pyrite. Pyrite replacement of soft tissue can only occur in exceptional circumstances of sediment chemistry when there is a low organic content, but a high concentration of dissolved iron. When a carcass is buried in such sediment, sulfate-reducing anaerobic bacteria break down its organic matter producing sulfide. The high concentration of iron in the sediment converts this to iron mono-sulfide. Finally, aerobic bacteria convert this by oxidation to pyrite. The requirement of early anaerobic and later aerobic bacteria means that the pyritisation must occur in the upper levels of the sediment, close to the aerobic-anaerobic interface. If the organic content of the sediment is too high the dissolved iron precipitates in the sediment and not in the carcass. Seawater sulfate ions diffusing toward animal carcasses enabled sulfate-reducing bacteria to oxidize the reactive organic matter of these remains, but the sulfide produced reacted promptly with the abundant Fe2+ ions of the pore water and pyrite precipitated right on the organic remains.

He died on May 7, 1977 in Krak√≥w. The exact circumstances of Pyjas‚Äô death are still a mystery and his case, which is still disputed, shook public opinion in Poland. According to one scenario he was murdered and the killers, probably members of the communist Secret Services, arranged the death to look like an accident. The official scenario, however, states that his death occurred after he fell from the stairs while being drunk. In 2011 his body was examined, and the outcome states that it was the fall that caused his death and that he had not been beaten. Oppositional activities Stanis≈Çaw Pyjas was born on August 4, 1953 in ≈ªywiec. After graduation from a local high school, he moved to Krak√≥w, to begin studies at the renowned Jagiellonian University. He studied Polish philology and philosophy. Some time in 1976 Pyjas joined the Workers' Defence Committee, the organization which was created to help laborers, participants in the anticommunist street protests in Radom and Warsaw. Together with friends from the University, Bronis≈Çaw Wildstein and Les≈Çaw Maleszka, Pyjas organized protests against repressions. Death Pyjas‚Äô body was found on May 7, 1977, in the staircase located in a building at 7 Szewska Street in Krak√≥w‚Äôs historic center. His death shook the student community, with around 1,000 people showing up at the funeral in the village of Gilowice. Street demonstrations, such as Krak√≥w‚Äôs Black March, erupted in several Polish cities and soon afterwards, Polish students, shaken by the death of their colleague, founded the Student Committee of Solidarity. On May 15, 1977, after a Black March, the founders urged the Polish government to reveal who was behind the crime. Among members of the Committee was Donald Tusk, who later became prime minister of Poland, and then EU President. It was the first organization of this kind in Eastern Europe. Aftermath The perpetrators of the crime have never been found. Three different investigations, carried out by the local prosecutor‚Äôs office and Milicja Obywatelska, stalled and finally ended, due to lack of evidence. Officially, Krak√≥w doctor Zdzis≈Çaw Marek stated that Pyjas, drunk, fell down the stairs, but Pyjas‚Äô friends did not believe it. Bronis≈Çaw Wildstein stated that he bribed a worker at the mortuary in Krak√≥w and entered the premises, to check the body of his fellow student. According to him, it was clear that Pyjas had been brutally beaten to death. A few weeks after Pyjas‚Äô death, the body of another student, Stanis≈Çaw Pietraszka, was found in the Solina Lake. According to his brother, it must have been a murder, as Pietraszka was afraid of water. He was the last person to have seen Pyjas alive and he gave a description of the possible murderer. Also, a person suspected of murder, a boxer of Cracovia, Marian Weclewicz, died in a mysterious accident. The role of Les≈Çaw Maleszka In late June 2008, private television TVN presented a documentary Trzech kumpli (Three mates), which presented the story of Wildstein, Pyjas and Les≈Çaw Maleszka (aka Ketman and Return). All three of them were friends in college, studied together and were active in anticommunist opposition. However, Maleszka, who afterwards worked for Gazeta Wyborcza, was a secret informer of S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. Maleszka was a highly praised agent, whose reports on students in Krak√≥w, in which he did not hesitate to describe the intimate lives of his closest friends, were called excellent by his secret service bosses. According to Roman Graczyk, a journalist and Maleszka‚Äôs friend from university, Pyjas had to die, because he might have suspected Maleszka of collaboration. The secret services did not want to lose such a valuable agent and an unknown officer ordered the assassination. On September 23, 2006, Pyjas was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross of the Polonia Restituta, by president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. In 2019, he was awarded the Cross of Freedom and Solidarity.

There is a lot of free parking space around. You will need up to 90 minutes from there to the summit. No special equipment is needed, there are a few fixed chains along the route but those are not exposed sections, good marking all the time, and orientation is not a problem.

Biography =Mayor of Tours= Born in Nevers, Ni√®vre, Royer was at first a teacher. In 1958 he was elected as a right-wing deputy from the Indre-et- Loire department, representing the city of Tours. While he was close to the Gaullist UNR, he did not join a parliamentary group. In 1959, he was elected to the office of Mayor of Tours, with the support of Charles de Gaulle. In the 1960s he led an expansion of the city, annexing the cities of Sainte- Radegonde-en-Touraine and de Saint-Symphorien in order to increase the surface area available for more constructions. His main accomplishment was the construction, in an area of four kilometres along the Cher River, of housing and parks. This area included an artificial lake. He sparked controversy by supporting the construction of the A10 along Tours. Described within his own party as an autocrat, Royer led a staunch policy vis-a-vis of social evolutions in the 1960s and 1970s. He outlawed pornographic films and brothels. In 1968 he expelled from Tours Michel-Georges Micberth, who had founded a psychological and pathological research center. =1974 candidacy= In 1973 he entered the Pierre Messmer government, leaving his seat vacant but stayed on as Mayor of Tours. During his tenure as Minister of Commerce, in December 1973, he wrote the Royer Law that regulated the construction of supermarkets that were more than 1000 m2. In early 1974, he briefly served as Minister of the PTT. On 11 April, he resigned from the government to be a candidate in the 1974 presidential election. He stood as the candidate of moral order, and polled up to 7%. However, his candidacy became a fiasco. He multiplied gaffes: he resigned from the government, unlike Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing; he installed his headquarters in Tours and not in Paris, and refused to take the plane during the campaign. His meetings were also a fiasco, in Toulouse the majority of his listeners were young students who laughed at him and yelled obscene sexual slogans. A young woman even went to the extent of undressing in front of the camera. He won 810,540 votes, or 3.17%. Most of his votes came from Indre-et-Loire, where he broke 30%. =Later life= After the presidential fiasco, Royer returned to Tours and won his old seat back in a by-election in 1976. His term as mayor became difficult in the wake of the economic crises. In the 1980s the city was hit by economic stagnation and many factories in the suburbs closed down, such as SKF in 1989. He was, however, credited with the extension of the TGV line to Tours and the construction of a congress center. Following his re-election in the 1993 election he joined the parliamentary group R√©publique et libert√© (composed of the Left Radical Party, the MDC, and other independents). He also served as leader of R√©publique et libert√©. In the 1995 local elections, he was defeated in his bid for re-election in a three-way race with the PS and RPR. The PS Jean Germain was elected. In the 2002 presidential election he supported the candidacy of Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement, before retiring from politics. In 2004 and 2007 he was hospitalized for \\"serious\\" health issues.

Playing career =Blackrock= O'Grady first played hurling with his local club Buttevant and the Collins club in Cork, however, it was as a member of the Blackrock club that he enjoyed his greatest successes. He claimed his first silverware in 1929 when the club defeated St. Finbarr's by 5-06 to 2-02 to win the Cork County Championship.

It was Bava's last theatrical feature before he died of a heart attack in 1980. In the United States, the film was released under the title Beyond the Door II as an unofficial sequel to Beyond the Door (1974).  Plot  Dora Baldini, her seven-year-old son Marco, and her new husband Bruno Baldini move into Dora's former home, where she lived during her first marriage to a man named Carlo. While Dora was pregnant with Marco, Carlo, an abusive heroin addict, was thought to have committed suicide at sea after his boat was found adrift. The incident resulted in Dora having a nervous breakdown and being placed in psychiatric care. With Bruno away as a commercial airline pilot, Dora is left all alone with Marco and only her shattered memory of the events of her former husband's death, caused by extensive electroshock treatment she received while institutionalized. Marco experiences various strange occurrences in the home, and is inexplicably drawn to the home's basement. Dora notices bizarre changes in Marco's personality, and is disturbed to find he has shredded her underwear. Unnerved by Marco's behavior and other frightening occurrences, Dora pleads with Bruno that they move out of the house, but he ignores her. While Bruno is on a flight, Dora finds a bundle of roses with a note addressed to her from Carlo. Suspecting Marco wrote it as a twisted joke, she confronts him, and slaps him in the face when he denies writing it. Dora brings Marco to her psychologist friend, Aldo Spidini, for examination. Aldo suggests that Dora's trauma from her marriage to Carlo may be triggering her to project feelings of spite or anger on Marco, though she confesses that she feels that Marco is being possessed by his deceased father. One afternoon, Dora finds the piano playing by itself, and witnesses drawings in Marco's room begin levitating, but is unable to find Marco. She eventually comes upon him in the den, and he asks her why she killed his father. This triggers a repressed memory, in which Dora recounts how she stabbed Carlo to death after he forcibly injected her with heroin and LSD. Distraught over the recollection, Dora is assured by Bruno that Carlo killed himself, and that her memory is only a delusion, but she remains steadfast that Carlo is haunting the home and possessing Marco. Dora awakens in the middle of the night from a nightmare to banging noises emanating from the basement. She investigates the noises, and finds Bruno smashing down a brick wall. Realizing Carlo's corpse has been hidden behind the wall, Dora is told by Bruno that she called him for help after murdering Carlo seven years ago. Wanting to save her from prison, Bruno hid Carlo's body in the house and released his boat to sea, staging his disappearance as a possible suicide. Bruno explains that they had to return to the home so that Carlo's remains wouldn't have been discovered, which would have happened had they sold it; he then tells her once he has transferred the remains elsewhere, they can leave. In an abrupt but frenetic blind rage, Dora swings a pickaxe at Bruno, impaling him in the chest and subsquently stuffs his corpse in the open wall along with Carlo's. Dora runs upstairs to search for Marco, but finds a ghoulish apparition of Carlo lying in his bed. Then in the hallway, Marco subsequently appears and starts running towards her, but suddenly transforms into Carlo as he embraces her causing Dora to scream with terror. Dora tries to flee from the house but encounters violent poltergeist activity that prevents her from doing so. She returns to the basement, where she inexplicably slashes her own throat with a boxcutter while hallucinating. Outside, Marco sits at a table in the backyard of the house, having tea with his mother and father's invisible ghosts.

The original script for Shock was written by Dardano Sacchetti and Francesco Barbieri in the early 1970s following their work on A Bay of Blood. The script's original title was Al 33 di via Orologio fa sempre freddo (\\"It's always cold at 33 Clock Street\\"), and was loosely based on the novel The Shadow Guest by Hillary Waugh. In 1973, Bava did pre-production work for this script with Mimsy Farmer doing a screen test for the leading part. This project was later shelved. Lamberto Bava would later return to the script and worked on it with Rabid Dogs co-writer Alessandro Parenzo, who was credited in the film as Paolo Brigenti. Lamberto stated that he and Sacchetti wanted to make a \\"modern\\" horror film, and were inspired by the works of Stephen King. The film went into production in 1977 and was shot over a period of five weeks. Mario let Lamberto direct some scenes in the film based on Mario's storyboards. Lamberto's official credit for directing is \\"Collaboration to the direction.\\" The musical score in the film was composed by the group Libra, with Carlo Pennisi on guitar, Alessandro Centofanti on keyboards, Dino Cappa on bass, and Walter Martino on drums. It was the group's last recording before breaking up later that year.  Release  Shock was released in Italy on 12 August 1977 where it was distributed by Titanus. One of the film's promotional posters utilised artwork adapted (without credit) from William Teason's cover design for Popular Library's paperback edition of the Shirley Jackson novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle. It grossed a total of 196,657,000 Italian lire on its domestic release. In the United States, Film Ventures International re-titled the film as Beyond the Door II, presented as a sequel to Ovidio Assonitis's 1974 possession film, Beyond the Door; however, the films were not linked in narrative or content aside from sharing the same child actor David Colin, Jr., and Film Ventures' decision to change the title was solely for marketing purposes in America.  Critical reception  Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times deemed Shock a \\"slowly paced and silly tale of demonic possession, though she noted that \\"to Bava's credit, he uses more Oedipal implications than mechanical gimmickry.\\" Daniel Ruth of The Tampa Tribune wrote of the film: \\"Director Mario Bava seems to have made a movie that neither shocks, nor surprises. Doors creak with predictability. Screams come dutifully on cue and the blood pours in countless pints.\\" Bob Freund of the Fort Lauderdale News was also critical of the film, deeming it \\"an incredible hulk of wasted film stock,\\" negatively comparing it to The Exorcist and The Omen. From a contemporary review, Scott Meek (Monthly Film Bulletin) described the film as \\"only a minor work from a past master of Italian commercial cinema, this shocker shows flashes of real style and of effectively sardonic humour.\\" The review concluded that \\"The post-Exorcist possession crazy is now so burdened with inferior product that it is a pity that Bava's contribution should have been delayed in reaching Britain. It proves, despite its faults, a good deal more entertaining than many of its American bedfellows.\\" From retrospective reviews, AllMovie called it \\"perhaps one of the more conventional offerings from a man whom many consider the founding father of Italian horror\\", though it \\"still bears the trademark style and technical trickery of Mario Bava's previous efforts\\". Film scholar Howard Hughes wrote of the film: \\"Though Shock appears to be yet another grainy, low- budget 1970s horror rip-off, it is made with some style,\\" also deeming Nicolodi's performance the best of her career.

Both Russia and Latvia are members of UN, OSCE and Council of Europe. They have recognized each other since 1991. History A meeting between the prime ministers of both countries Valdis Dombrovskis and Dmitry Medvedev during the 2013 Baltic Sea Forum Latvian President Valdis Zatlers with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in a signing ceremony during Zatlers' 2010 official visit in Russia. Embassy of Latvia in 3 Chaplygin Street, Moscow =1920-1940= From 1920 to 1940, relations between the countries had existed. On August 11, 1920, the Republic of Latvia and the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic signed a peace treaty. Article 14 of the Treaty provided for the establishment of diplomatic and consular contacts between the parties upon ratification of the peace treaty. In 1922 USSR had been founded, which took over the foreign affairs of its member states (including Russia). The Latvian Embassy was located in Moscow from 1920 to 1940. Latvia's first diplomatic representative in Soviet Russia was Ambassador JƒÅnis Vesmanis, accredited on 2 November 1920. Latvian consular representations were established during the Civil War period (1919-1920) in Blagoveshchensk and Murmansk. Consular functions were also performed by representatives of the Latvian Interim Government: in Northern Russia by Alfreds Ikners (Archangelsk), in Southern Russia by Kristaps Bahmanis (Kiev) and Rudolfs Liepins (Don and Kuban). From June 1919 to October 1920, Latvia was also represented in Siberia and the Urals by JƒÅnis Mazpolis (Vladivostok). =Soviet period= The Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, which included deportations to Siberian Gulags (June deportation), created a large degradation of Latvian-Russian relations. Nazi Germany then occupied Latvia in 1941 German occupation of Latvia during World War II, until the USSR returned in 1944 to resume occupation, resulting in further deportations. During this period many Latvians fled with the retreating Germans or to Sweden. The Soviet occupation dramatically increased the number of Russians living in Latvia in a short space of time, often replacing those who were deported, executed or had fled. The high influx of Russians and the removal of Latvian as the official language caused further deterioration in the Latvia-Russian relations between citizens.

In 2007, the border treaty between the two states was ratified after Latvia dropped a claim for a small pre-World War II territory that's currently part of modern Russia. While speaking at the Latvia-Russia Business Forum in St. Petersburg, President Valdis Zatlers spoke in favor of a visa free regime between the EU and Russia.

Born in Cork, O'Connell first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Cork senior team before later joining the junior side. He made his senior debut during the 1921 championship. O'Connell subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won three All-Ireland medals, four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, O'Connell won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a five-time championship medallist with St. Finbarr's. Throughout his career O'Connell made 27 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1934 championship. Playing career =Club= O'Connell enjoyed his first success with St. Finbarr's in 1923. After reaching the final of the club championship, \\"the Barr's\\" were granted a walkover from Blackrock as they couldn't field a team as a result of sustaining several injuries in the semi- final. It was O'Connell's first championship medal. St. Finbarr's and Blackrock qualified for a dream championship decider again in 1923, however, \\"the Barr's\\" were not granted a walkover on this occasion. After a fierce hour of hurling St. Finbarr's narrowly won by 0‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì2, with O'Connell collecting a second championship medal. After two years of Blackrock dominance, both sides faced off against each other in the 1926 decider. Blackrock, containing ten of the side that had represented Cork in the All-Ireland decider just a short few weeks beforehand, were deemed unstoppable as they set out to secure a third successive title. A narrow 6‚Äì2 to 5‚Äì4 victory for St. Finbarr's gave O'Connell a third championship medal. In 1932 St. Finbarr's bounced back to reach the championship decider once again. Carrigtwohill provided the opposition, however, the Barr's played with a strong wind in the first half and were 2‚Äì1 ahead before Carrig's first score. St. Finbarr's built up a considerable lead at the interval and got another soft goal in the opening minutes of the second half, to lead by fourteen points. For the rest of the match though Carrig fought back. In spite of this, a narrow 5‚Äì3 to 4‚Äì4 score line secured the title for St. Finbarr's and a fourth championship medal for O'Connell. Both O'Connell's side and Carrigtwohill met in the county final again in 1933. An exciting game produced a draw. The replay saw St. Finbarr's make no mistake. After taking an early lead they powered to a 6‚Äì6 to 5‚Äì0 victory. It was O'Connell's fifth championship medal. =Inter-county= Beginnings O'Connell made his senior championship debut with Cork on 28 May 1922 in a 5‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì2 Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick. After a number of years on the senior team, O'Connell joined the junior team in 1925. He won a Munster medal that year following a 6‚Äì3 to 4‚Äì2 defeat of Clare in the provincial decider. Period of dominance O'Connell was back on the senior team in time for the 1926 championship. He later won his first Munster medal following a three-game saga with Tipperary, culminating in a 3‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì4 victory for Cork. O'Connell was confined to the substitutes' bench for Cork's subsequent 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì0 All-Ireland final defeat of Kilkenny. After being dropped from the team in 1927, O'Connell was back the following year. He later won a second Munster medal following a 6‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì2 defeat of Clare in a replay. On 9 September 1928 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. The Westerners, who got a bye into the final without lifting a hurley, were no match as a rout ensued. \\"Gah\\" Ahern ran riot scoring 5‚Äì4, a record for an All- Ireland final, as Cork triumphed by 6‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì0. It was O'Connell's first All- Ireland medal on the field of play. O'Connell won a third Munster medal as Cork made it four-in-a-row following a 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì3 defeat of Waterford. On 1 September 1929 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final for the second successive year. Little had changed in a year as Cork were on the top of their game again. A rout ensued as \\"the Rebels\\" and O'Connell claimed a second All- Ireland medal with a 4‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3 victory. Cork exited the championship at the first hurdle in 1930, however, O'Connell finished the year by winning a National Hurling League medal following a 3‚Äì5 to 3‚Äì0 defeat of Dublin the decider. Third All-Ireland medal O'Connell won a fourth Munster medal 1in 1931 following a 5‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of Waterford. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from \\"Gah\\" Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì2. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments Cork captain Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1‚Äì6 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Kilkenny's Lory Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn't be found and both sides finished level again at 2‚Äì5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Central Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Kilkenny's captain Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star player couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4. It was O'Connell's third and final All-Ireland medal. =Inter-provincial= In 1930 O'Connell was chosen on the Munster team that reached the final of the inter-provincial championship. A 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Leinster gave O'Connell a Railway Cup medal. Death On 27 January 1966, O'Connell died from a stroke as a result of diabetes aged 65.

He supplied rations for the English Navy as deputy victualler and supervised the construction of Upnor Castle. After Queen Elizabeth I pronounced his house was \\"satis\\" (Latin for enough) after a visit in 1573, the house was thereafter known as Satis House. Famed locally for his philanthropy, he died on 10 September 1579, leaving money in his will to establish the Richard Watts Charity and Six Poor Travellers House in Rochester High Street. He is buried, in accordance with his will, in Rochester Cathedral. Biography The precise date and place of Richard's birth is uncertain. A Richard Watts born in West Peckham in 1529 is believed to be Richard Watts of Rochester. However, there is evidence of an older Richard Watts living on Boley Hill, at a date during the supposed childhood of the Richard Watts born in West Peckham. Little is known of the early life of Richard Watts. He may have spent his youth in Rochester gaining employment with Bishop (later Saint) John Fisher. Following the arrest and execution of Fisher, Watts returned to Rochester in a state of poverty. Memorial in Rochester Cathedral with bust assumed to be contemporary By 1550, Richard Watts was established as a merchant. Payments were made to him for victualling the army and navy in 1550 and 1551. In either 1552 (Lane & Singh) or 1554 (Hinkley) he was appointed deputy victualler of the navy. The earlier date fits in with the grant of a coat of arms in 1553. In 1559, he was reappointed to the post. Subsequently, Queen Elizabeth I appointed him as paymaster and surveyor of works when building of Upnor Castle started in 1560. A further royal appointment, that of surveyor of ordnance, followed in 1562. In 1560, as well as his appointment to the castle, he became paymaster to the Wardens of Rochester Bridge. In 1563, he was elected as MP for Rochester which seat he held until 1571. Richard died on 10 September 1579 at home. His will starts with \\"First I bequeath my Soule unto the Holy Trinity as is aforesaid and my Body to be buried in The Cathedrall Church of Rochester aforesaid neare unto the Steeple and Staires going up into the Quire on the South side of the same Staires\\". His will goes on to describe a procession from his house to the cathedral complete with curate and the \\"singing children\\" from the cathedral all \\"in their Surplices\\". After a service and sermon, he was to be buried. Various disbursements are made to those taking part, including to the sextons for digging the grave and ringing his knell \\"with all the bells\\". Even the congregation was remembered for unto every \\"poore Body\\" attending the burial he left \\"One penney in bread and One penny in money\\". He earmarked five pounds for this so was assuming an attendance of some 600 poor mourners. His grave, with coat of arms and simple inscription, is close to the south side of the pulpitum steps, just where he wanted it. In 1730, just over 150 years after his death, the city council resolved to erect a monument to his memory. A Mr. Charles Easton was tasked with the same for a sum of ¬£50 (). The memorial in the south transept of the cathedral incorporates the bust mentioned above. The bust appears to have been given by Josiah Brooke the current owner of Satis house, for below the bust and above the inscription a bold statement testifies: \\"Archetypum hunc dedit IOS. BROOKE de SATIS Arm\\". The will Plaque recording Mary's second marriage on the Six Poor Travellers house Watts' instructions for his funeral take up the first quarter of his will. The next part of the will leaves money and income to his wife and details what should happen if she remarried, which she in due course did. A few other family bequests follow, then the main charitable section starts. The old almshouse beside the market cross was to be extended and refurbished with provision for casual travellers. There was provision for raw materials to be given to the poor to enable them to earn a living. Later the Mayor, principal citizens and commonalty of Rochester are enjoined to \\"preserve and maintain the stocke\\" so that the \\"yearely gaine and proffitts thereof riseing shall imploy to the uses and purposes aforesaid ... principally to the reliefe and comfort of the said poore Travellers\\". He laid upon his heirs the duty to supervise the Mayor and appointed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Rochester as having the final say in any disposals. The will was proved on 25 September 1579 \\"in common form\\" and before witnesses on 25 November the following year. City accounts for 1579 show that this was not without cost: a gallon of wine to the Bishop's chancellor for the proving (2s), a trip to London (13s 4d), a copy of the will (5s) and others \\"aboute the probate\\" (20s 10d). ¬£2-1-2 in those days is . As portrayed in Rochester Guildhall. The will was not without its problems. Some of the properties disposed of were jointly owned with his wife, who therefore became the sole owner on his death. Some of the lands he had bequeathed had reverted (either on death or previously) to former owners, including a set of tenements which the Bishop took back. Marian did remarry and according to the will should have lost the house. However she and her new husband, a lawyer named Thomas Pagitt, wished to keep the house. In 1593, a document was drawn up between the four parties interested in the will: Thomas & Marian, Mayor & citizens, Dean & Chapter, and the Bridge Wardens. The document was called the \\"Indenture Quadripartite\\". In brief (the indenture is over 14 pages long when set in modern print) Marian was allowed to keep the house in return for giving up all other claims and returning the 100 marks left to her in the original will. The bulk of the document establishes the form and government of the charity which now bears Richard Watts' name. Richard Watts Charities Richard Watts' will when proved in 1579 provided for an almshouse in Rochester High Street. now known as the Six Poor Travellers House, to be expanded and maintained. The \\"Indenture Quadripartite\\" of 1593 established the form and government of Richard Watts Charity which over time built other almshouses and expanded to incorporate several local charities, such as St Catherine's Hospital founded under the charity of Symond Potyn in 1315. Richard Watts Charities, as of 2013, provides 66 self-contained flats in Rochester which includes almshouses in Maidstone Road built in 1857. =1853 onwards= The Charitable Trusts Act of 1853 brought a large number of independent trusts and charities under the supervision of the newly created Charity Commissioners. Watts' Charity was no exception. A new scheme was devised for the running of the charity. The charity was run buy Municipal Trustees who appointed a Clerk and Receiver. They also appointed a Master and Matron to manage the poor travellers house. ¬£4,000 was used to build a new set of almshouses for 20 people in Maidstone Road. ¬£100 was set aside to provide an apprenticeship premium for children who had distinguished themselves at school. ¬£2,000 was spent on the building of the Watts Public Baths with ¬£200 per annum for maintenance. In 1935, they passed into the hands of the Corporation of Rochester though the annual grant towards costs continued for a further 20 years. ¬£4,000 was granted to the Trustees of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester to enable them to build a \\"Hospital and Dispensary for the relief of the Sick poor\\". The charity was also to pay ¬£1,000 (later raised to ¬£1,500) per annum to the hospital and gained the right to nominate as patients up to 20 people at any one time. These donations were maintained until 1948 until the hospital came under the control of the National Health Service. In 1886, there was a further scheme extending the work of the charity. 11 outpensions of 7/- (35p) per week were established and two exhibitions of ¬£100 made available annually, one each to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School and Rochester Grammar School for Girls. There were five exhibitions for pupil teachers, each of ¬£6/5/0 annually for three years. The Watts Nursing Service was established with two full-time nurses (one midwife, one district) and six occasional nurses. The 1934 supplementary scheme increased certain payments and handed the baths over to the council. =Post war= The 1942 Beveridge Report led to the establishment of the modern British Welfare State. The previous, limited, National Insurance Act 1911 was extended to most workers by the National Insurance Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 1946 introduced universal health care and the National Assistance Act provided a safety net replacing the old Poor Laws. The upshot was that by 1950 much of the charity's former purpose had been taken over by the state. A review of operations led to the scheme of 1954. Some money was available to help travellers in need of financial assistance and some for \\"amenities or samaritan funds\\" at hospitals within the city. Some money was available for apprenticeships, for books, tools, fees and examinations. Power was obtained for discretionary grants to relieve hardship or distress, either directly or via other institutions. By 1976, sufficient funds were available to extend the almshouses. In 1977, yet another scheme came into operation. Several charities, some of which were already administered by the Trustees of Richard Watts Charity were amalgamated under the title: \\"Richard Watts and the City of Rochester Almshouse Charities\\": * Richard Watts General * Hayward's Almshouses * The Chatham Intra Charity of Richard Watts * St. Catherine's Hospital Charities =Watts' Nursing Service= The scheme of 1855 set up a nursing service to provide maternity care and to care for the afflicted poor of the parish. Any of the inmates of the Almshouses were able to call on their services in time of sickness. Care was free. A Head Nurse supervised the service, relying on nurses to provide the actual care. The Head Nurse periodically attended on all those in the care of nurses to check on the standard of work. She also had to visit all inmates of the almshouses once a week, ensure adequate fire precautions and prepare the boardroom for meetings. Things did not always go smoothly. Thomas Aveling complained in January 1871 about \\"the reported inefficiency of the Nurses ... more than twelve months since\\", which is interesting because as mayor 1869‚Äì70 he had a level of supervision of the charity. On 2 June 1871 he was appointed to be a trustee at around the same time he left the council. During the 1930s home-helps were employed by the charity to assist new mothers for up to 21 days after the birth. They were expected to attend from 8 am to 8 pm and to cook, supervise older children (getting them to school and afterwards to bed) and wash the children's clothes. Washing the patient and making the bed were, however, the prerogative of the nurse. Although the scheme seemed to work well, it was too expensive for the charity and the home-helps were discontinued after 1938. The scheme was not without problems. In 1941 the Royal College of Nursing exprtessed concern to the trustees for \\"advertising for a SRN [State Registered Nurse] for district work at a salary of ¬£130 p.a.\\" Eventually an increase of ¬£50 p.a. was agreed for each nurse. In 1945 the Nurses' Salaries Commission reported and the Ministry of Health established norms for the profession. Thereafter the rates agreed by the Whitley Council were paid. The coming of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1946 brought a dramatic change to the charity. The county council had the task of organising a free home nursing service for all persons who needed it. Local organisations could participate, they would need to fund 25% of the cost, the county providing the remaining 75%. The charity's nursing service was incorporated on this basis into the NHS with the county funding ¬£2,000 and the charity ¬£1,500. The Charity Commissioners were not happy with a charity becoming permanently involved in the NHS and only permitted the arrangement to run until December 1950. The nursing service continued to provide a reduced independent service until all patients were transferred to the NHS on 31 March 1958. The Nursing Branch of the charity then ceased to exist. =Watts Public Baths= The 1855 scheme empowered the trustees to erect public baths and washhouses. There was a site by the river which had been occupied by the baths of the Castle Club. The trustees duly obtained it and built new baths, opening in 1880. Both private baths and swimming baths were provided. The swimming baths were used by schools. Between 1882 and 1925, some three and a half thousand children had learnt to swim there. The baths were never run profitably, a yearly grant of ¬£200 from the charity being required. Finally in 1935, the baths were handed over to Rochester Corporation, though the annual grant remained for a further 15 years. Satis House Queen Elizabeth I was the guest of Richard Watts during her royal progress of 1573. When he asked her if his house was to her liking, she replied 'Satis' (Latin for 'enough'). The house was thereafter known as 'Satis House'. Archbishop Longley was born in Satis house in 1794. The house has been rebuilt and is now the administration building for The King's School, Rochester. A bust of Watts has been set on top of the building's portico. Although Charles Dickens in his novel Great Expectations used the name Satis House for Miss Havisham's house, his biographer, John Forster, felt that some aspects of the fictitious Satis House were modelled on nearby Restoration House.

Records in 1964. Four of the five tracks are reworkings of pieces originally recorded on John Coltrane's 1960 Giant Steps and Coltrane Plays the Blues, rearranged by Shepp and Roswell Rudd. Coltrane himself co-produced the album alongside Bob Thiele. The album was Shepp's first release for Impulse!, and would be followed by more than a dozen additional releases on the label. Background According to Coltrane biographer Ashley Kahn, Four for Trane \\"was a direct result of Coltrane‚Äôs intervention, and his faith in the young tenor saxophonist from Philadelphia.\\" Shepp recalled his efforts to get a recording date with Impulse!: \\"I had spent months trying to get Bob [Thiele] on the phone and he never answered the phone. Every time I'd call, his secretary, Lillian, whom I got to know very well, but at that point I hated her because she said, 'Well he's gone out to lunch,' or 'He's gone home and he's not coming back.' I was living in a fifth-floor walk-up and I'd save a dollar a day just to make ten calls. I'd run down and put a dime in the phone in the drugstore. This went on for months... So this one night I sat in with Trane at the Half Note. I got up enough courage to ask if he would intercede. So John gave me a look ‚Äî the first time he really sort of looked at me in a very critical way, very questioning. He said, 'You know, a lot of people think I'm easy.' Then he took a very hard look at me. I said, 'Well, John, you can be sure I'm not trying to take advantage. I need this.' He knew I loved him. It wasn't about just trying to get off easy. So he looked at me and he says, 'Well, I'll see what I can do...' The next day I called Thiele's office and lo and behold the secretary says, 'Well, he's not in now but he will be back at three o'clock and he's waiting for your call.' So when I did talk to him, the first thing he said is, 'You guys are avant-garde. I know you're into your own thing. If you do this recording you're going to have to record all of John's music.' I had just been waiting for the chance to do that. I loved Trane's music and I had my own ideas about how to work with it. That became the Four for Trane date...\\" Regarding the recording session, Shepp said: \\"When we did the Four for Trane date, it went down almost take by take, because we had rehearsed nightly for months. After the third song, Bob, who had been really terribly rude at the beginning, smoking his pipe like a chimney, he brightened up a bit, sat down and said, 'I've got to call John and tell him this stuff is great.' He said, 'John, you got to come out and hear this!' Well, Coltrane already knew. He had been listening to this stuff for the last couple of years because the avant-garde was all around New York... John was very gracious. He drove out from his home in Long Island to Englewood, at about eleven o'clock at night. I assumed he got out of his bed, because when we took that photo they put on the album cover [he was] with no socks, you know.\\" Reception The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \\"Core Collection\\" calling it \\"one of the classic jazz albums of the '60s and a fascinating glimpse into how thoroughly different what was already thought of as the Coltrane revolution might sound.\\" The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek states that \\"When it came to sheer exuberance and expression, [Shepp] was a force to be reckoned with in his youth, and it shows in each of the tunes recorded here. Four for Trane is a truly fine, original, and lasting album from an under-celebrated musician\\".Jurek, T. [ AllMusic Review] accessed April 6, 2009. Tom Terrell wrote: \\"Shepp and his crew of iconoclasts... took four of the master's best known tunes and made 'em new again.\\" Robert Spencer wrote that Shepp's arrangements \\"succeed beautifully, not in restating Coltrane's work on these pieces, but making them something new... While Coltrane‚Äôs songs were widely thought of as empty platforms for blowing, Shepp shows here that they have the depth to stand a different treatment.\\" Leroi Jones stated that \\"[t]his group that Shepp has gotten together for this date cannot fail to delight and inspire anyone really interested in moving human expression.\\" He wrote: \\"the fact that this album is called Four for Trane demonstrates how much of an emotional allegiance Shepp feels he owes John Coltrane. But even with such acknowledged 'allegiance,' don't think for a moment that you're going to hear J.C. played back at you intact. Archie is so much his own self that it is finally impossible to name one influence as having been the guiding one... his range of expression is so broad that he seems to take in or to have digested most of the ways of playing tenor saxophone.\\" Track listing All compositions by John Coltrane, except where noted. #\\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\" ‚Äì 8:30 #\\"Mr. Syms\\" ‚Äì 7:41 #\\"Cousin Mary\\" ‚Äì 7:14 #\\"Naima\\" ‚Äì 7:09 #\\"Rufus (Swung His Face At Last To The Wind, Then His Neck Snapped)\\" (Shepp) ‚Äì 6:24 Personnel *Alan Shorter ‚Äì flugelhorn *John Tchicai ‚Äì alto saxophone *Archie Shepp ‚Äì tenor saxophone *Roswell Rudd ‚Äì trombone, arranger *Reggie Workman ‚Äì double bass *Charles Moffett ‚Äì drums References Category:1964 albums Category:Archie Shepp albums Category:Impulse!

It was developed at Columbia University between 1984 and 1990, and is a Unix reimplementation of a 1978 TOPS-20 email program, also known as MM, which in turn was an update of an earlier program by Michael McMahon of SRI International. Columbia MM has also been built on other platforms, including DOS and VMS. MM was unusual for its time in its support of \\"message sequences,\\" which allowed the user to select a subset of messages in a mailbox for batch operations. The message sequence feature proved so popular with MM users that TOPS-20 MM author Mark Crispin went on to implement similar filtering capabilities in Pine. Columbia MM also offered context- sensitive help, command completion, and command history, carried over from the TOPS-20 version, before such features were commonplace in Unix software. After a lull in development in 1990, MM development picked up again in 2002 with an interim release, including changes for Linux portability and POP support. History At Columbia University in the late 1970s the DEC-20 based MM was adopted in favor of DEC-20 MAIL and RDMAIL, and was used initially among the programming staff. Its use spread to the students and faculty, to the extent that several courses came to use it heavily. It was likely that, if you did a SYSTAT on any DEC-20 at Columbia between 1978 and 1988, you would see about half the users running EMACS and the other half MM, with only occasional time out for text formatting, program compilation, and file transfer. When Columbia switched to Unix-based platforms during the 1980s the MM program was rewritten for that platform and development continued on the program for the next 20 years. As of version 0.91 (2003) MM worked on the following platforms: Solaris (2.5.1 and later); SunOS 4.1; Linux (e.g. RH7.1); FreeBSD 4.4; OpenBSD 3.0, NetBSD 1.5.2.ftp://columbia.edu/pub/mm/README.TXT References * Using the MM email client in the Modern World (Feb 2014) * MM History * MM Source Code * Introduction to MM * MM Manual (1996) See also *Brief Tutorial Showing Basic Commands From 1997 *Privnote Notes That Will Self-Destruct After Being Read Category:Email clients ","title":"Columbia MM"},{"id":"18230734","text":"73096 at the Severn Valley Railway in 2003 73096 at Alresford station 73096 arriving at Alton station British Railways Standard Class 5 No. 73096 is a preserved British steam locomotive, unnamed in service. It has spent most of its time in preservation (since 1985) in the care of the Watercress Line (Mid- Hants Railway).  BR Operation  73096 was built at British Railways' Derby Works in November 1955 and was used on the London Midland and Western Regions of British Railways. It was withdrawn from service at Patricroft depot in the north west of England in November 1967 and sold to Woodham Brothers scrapyard based in Barry, South Wales.  Preservation  Rescued from the scrapyard in July 1985 by Hampshire-based businessman John Bunch, 73096 was returned to service in October 1993 by the Mid-Hants Railway on the Watercress Line, following major boiler overhaul and the construction of a new tender, based on the chassis from an LMS Jubilee Class tender, to a to BR1G style. Operated on the Watercress Line between Alresford and Alton in its new lease of life, 73096 has been temporarily disguised as 73080 Merlin and as 73054, for special events and commemorations. In September 2011, its boiler certificate expired and 73096 was consequently withdrawn from service. It left the Mid-Hants for Southall in late 2014. In November 2017, 73096 was purchased by the Mid-Hants- Railway and returned to Ropley for assessment and overhaul. In 2018 it was suggested that the locomotive could be back in steam by 2025. =Cylinder failure= The engine suffered over ¬£200,000 worth of damage during the 14 March 2009 Spring Steam Gala services on the Mid-Hants Railway. Whilst on the first Alresford to Alton service of the day, 73096 suffered major damage to its left-hand (driver's-side) cylinder at Wander's Curve in the Ropley to Medstead section, about ¬æ of a mile from Ropley station. It is thought a piston core-plug worked loose thus causing much damage to the cylinder covers, cylinder, piston and piston-rod plus other equipment in the area. There is no evidence that this was caused by priming (water in the cylinders, which can cause similar catastrophic failures) and the crew were absolved of any blame at the time of the incident. No damage was done to the track or signalling, but No. 73096 blocked the line for some time. Shuttle services were quickly organised between Alresford and Ropley and between Alton and Medstead, until the line could be cleared. Parts of the steam locomotive's 'motion' (connecting rod, valve gear linkages etc.) on the driver's side had to be removed by motive power depot staff to allow the locomotive to be moved. As the 5MT was unable to move under its own power, a diesel locomotive was dispatched from Ropley engine shed to retrieve it. The Gala thereafter continued with a revised timetable. A replacement cylinder casting was required, necessitating a new pattern made. As of the week commencing 9 August 2010, the locomotive was running again, hauling services on the line masquerading as Henry during the 'Day out with Thomas' event. See also *Watercress Line In 2019 the locomotive was collected and delivered to Dorset Steam Fair to raise awareness (and money) to have it repaired. Famous train transport firm Allelys transported the loco which was the subject of a 2019 programme on Yesterday Channel called Steam Truckers. Repeated several times.

He played hurling with his local club Carrigtwohill and with the Cork senior inter-county team in the 1920s and 1930s. Playing career =Club= Barry played his club hurling with his local club in Carrigtwohill club and enjoyed some success. In spite of this he never won a senior county title with the club. =Inter-county= Barry first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork in the late 1920s. He made his debut in 1928 as Cork faced Clare in the Munster final for the second year in-a-row. That game ended in a draw, however, in the replay Cork triumphed with Barry collecting his first Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, however, the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6-12 to 1-0 gave Cork the victory and gave Barry an All-Ireland medal. In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave Barry his second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year's game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4-9 to 1-3 giving Barry his second All-Ireland title. In 1930 Barry added a National Hurling League title to his collection; however, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with Barry collecting a third Munster winners‚Äô medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level ‚Äì 1-6 apiece. Eudie Coughlan played a captain's role in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level ‚Äì 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, this was rejected. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA‚Äôs Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All- Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5-8 to 3-4 giving Barry his third and final All-Ireland medal. References * Corry, Eoghan, The GAA Book of Lists (Hodder Headline Ireland, 2005).

Much like the American M2 4.2 inch mortar it was intended to deliver chemical munitions, such as gas and smoke shells, as well as ordinary high-explosive shells. It was derived from Rheinmetall's Nebelwerfer 51 and 52 prototypes of the late Thirties which were attempts to develop a more accurate and longer-ranged mortar than the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35. The NbW 40 is one of the better examples of German overengineering since it fired a slightly heavier bomb over twice as far as the NbW 35, but weighed almost eight times more than the earlier model. It was an innovative breech- loading design with the wheels permanently attached to the carriage, from which it was fired, and which wasn't disassembled for transport. It replaced the NbW 35 in ( \\"smoke or fog-thrower\\") battalions belonging to the Chemical Corps of the Heer; exactly how the American fielded their own M2s in chemical mortar battalions. It was replaced by the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher from 1941.  Operational use  They began to replace the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35 mortars from late 1941 in the Nebelwerfer battalions, and were used by Gebirgs-Werfer-Abteilung (Mountain Mortar Battalion) 10 plus the first battalion of the Nebel-Lehr Regiment (Demonstration Regiment) and saw service in the North Africa, Finland and Russia.

We still have some way to go because Catholic-Jewish relations is one of this century's most positive developments. :We remain concerned with the persistence of anti-Semitism - the hatred of Jews and Judaism, which is on the rise in some parts of the world. We are encouraged by your vigorous leadership in denouncing all forms of anti- Semitism, and by the church's recent teachings. The church's repudiation of anti-Semitism is of critical importance in the struggle to eradicate this virulent plague from the entire human family. :Anti-Semitism may affect the body of the Jew, but history has tragically shown that it assaults the soul of the Christian world and all others who succumb to this ancient, but persistent pathology. :We hope that your strong condemnations of anti-Semitism will continue to be implemented in the schools, the parishes, teaching materials and the liturgy, and reflected in the attitudes and behavior of Catholics throughout the world. Greater attention needs to be paid to the Christian roots of anti-Semitism. The teaching of contempt reaped a demonic harvest during the Shoah in which one-third of the Jewish people were murdered as a central component of a nation's policy. The Nazi Holocaust-Shoah brought together two very different forms of evil: On the one hand it represented the triumph of an ideology of nationalism and racism, the suppression of human conscience and the deification of the state - concepts that are profoundly anti-Christian as well as anti-Jewish. On the other hand the Shoah was the culmination of centuries of anti-Semitism in European culture for which Christian teachings bear a heavy responsibility.

It stars Lawrence Raghavendra, Mumtaj, Snigdha Akolkar, Kamna Jethmalani, Meenakshi, and Karunas. The film was released on 15 May 2009 and received a huge negative response.http://www.sify.com/movies/rajadhi-raja- review--pclxdMhaaffbd.html Plot Raja (Raghava Lawrence) is a native of Coutrallam. Tragedy strikes his adolescent life when his father loses his hand when a doctor in an inebriated condition operates on him. The doctor fearing legal consequences bribes the local police to take care of the issue. Young Raja witnesses police brutality on his father causing his father's health to deteriorate. On his deathbed, his father gets a promise from Raja that he would make his three brothers into a cop, lawyer, and doctor. Raja realises his mission, and stops his studies to earn money to make his brothers into what he promised. The brothers are provided shelter and food by a local elderly woman (Paravai Muniyamma) whom Raja affectionately calls as paati. She has a granddaughter Lakshmi (Neelima Rani), whom Raja considers as his own sister. Now Raja in his adulthood makes ends meet as a bus driver, while his three brothers become doctor, policeman and lawyer as per his father's wish. One day, his sister shows disinterest in going to college and complains about eve-teasing. Raja dismisses the claim and asks her to attend. She convinces him to come with her. On seeing her a group of college men start ogling her. Raja walks up to them, and suggests them to ogle at voluptuous women like Nayanthara and leave not so good looking girls like his sister alone. The youths ignoring his words, remarks that Raja's sister indeed has a curvy Hourglass figure and proceeds to molest her. Enraged by this Raja fights and chases them away warning others to stay away from his sister. Raja is then kidnapped by Thangapazham (Meenakshi) while he is asleep by a group of woman she controls. She expresses her lust over Raja and pronounces that she will get him to do what she says. Raja escapes from her while she's distracted. Thangapazham is then kidnapped by Krishnamoorthy (Karunas) who inturn expresses his lust over thangapazham which she blatantly ignores. Meanwhile Shailja (Mumtaj), a woman gangster turned politician who openly admits to having slept her way to become a minister, is seen beating up a cop for not falling on her feet. Eventually she murders him and mocks at his dead body for falling on her feet after death. Thangapazham again woos Raja this time asking him to massage her. Raja reluctantly agrees and takes her to a secluded place where he oil massages the half naked woman. On seeing his woman of interest with another man, Krishnamurthy gets aroused and jealous at the same time. During a college function Lakshmi and Shailaja get into an altercation. Shailaja takes Lakshmi and beats her. Raja comes to his sister's rescue beating up goons. He then proceeds to remove Shailaja's sari to humiliate her and forces her followers to sexually assault her. When a follower remarks she's like a sister, Raja mentions that after ogling Shailaja's body from top to bottom for so long, it was time they cut their dirty imaginations and proceed to perform real actions. He pushes some of them towards her and takes few pictures while they fall on her. Later, Raja is once again kidnapped by Thangapazham, this time wearing slinky clothes to arouse Raja. She proceeds to threaten Raja and forces him to measure her body with a tape. He reluctantly measure her waist and hips. When measuring her bust while Raja initially tries to look away, Thangapazham forces him to see her while doing so to arouse him. He measures and is shocked at the size. Thangapazham remarks that two inches have increased and that it's fine. Raja then gets into a local Jallikattu competition which he eventually wins. The organizer, a local village chief announces that Raja will wed his daughter. He pulls his friend Krishna Murthy along in this mess. At the wedding Raja is desperate to escape but unable to do so. Thangapazham enters and stops the wedding by throwing a hand grenade in the crowd causing people to run. After this, Lakshmi gets sick and is admitted into one of the hospitals run by Raja's brother. However turning greedy he demands money and gets into a fight with Paati. He then brutally murders the sister out of rage and the old woman to eliminate a possible eyewitness. It is revealed that all three brothers are corrupt and accomplices of Shailaja. After learning this, Raja swears an oath to eliminate the three brothers by betraying them while acting to be on their side. When spying on his brothers he meets with Nikhita (Snigdha Akolkar), a girl who admires Raja for his character. It is revealed that she is the sister of the dreaded Shailaja. The lawyer brother, during his visit to a local school, wishes to sexually abuse a girl. He then eventually sedates and proceeds to abuse her. Raja wearing a helmet enters and beats the brother vigorously, saving the girl. His brother can't see the face of the assaulter. Enters Nurse Namitha (Kamna Jethmalani),a buxom woman ogled by many men in the hospital. Raja eventually ends up befriending her, when he tries to perform a stint against his brother to collect evidences. Raja then witnesses his police brother brutally stir up a riot and intentionally kill an innocent civilian using a sledgehammer brutally smashing the skull. At night, when the police officer pairs up with a high- class prostitute Babilona for sex in his police vehicle, Raja ties the vehicle and traps them inside using a crane. He gets caught red-handed the next morning and is suspended from office. The three brothers initially suspect Raja, but he manipulates them into believing that he's innocent. The doctor brother is a pervert who keeps camera inside the nurses' dressing room and watches while they change dress. Watching one such nurse remove her dress, he's called for work. Using this opportunity Raja enters and breaks the camera, stealing the doctor's laptop for evidence. He beats the doctor viciously. Later knowing about her sister and his friendship, Shailaja orders her goons to beat up Raja. He beats them and shows that he is unbeatable. He then proceeds to slap Shailaja in her butt, mocking her in the process. He then asks Nikita to slap her sister Shailaja using her footwear, in order for him to love her, which she happily does. During an award ceremony for his doctor brother, Raja blackmails using the previous evidences he gathered, forcing him to agree and announce infront of the crowd that he will perform 100 heart surgeries for free. Shailaja later enters the brothers home for a meet. Fearing recognition Raja masks his face with cream and mimicks a feminine voice. Failing to recognise him, she has a quick convo with Raja. Raja then asks Shailaja to adjust her sari, mocking that she is exposing her assets. During a visit to a temple, Shailaja is in her caravan travelling. The caravan is abducted and taken control by Raja and Krishna Murthy. He then remarks that his lover, Shailaja's sister is a little thin while Shailaja on the other hand is a buxom woman, who is naturally arousing to men. He then forces Shailaja to wear slinky clothes using an evidence of her murdering a temple official. She agrees out of fear, now all of her thighs exposed, a shy Shailaja reluctantly gets down. On seeing her in such skimpy clothes on a temple occasion people get angry and start riots. Making her eventually lose her minister position. Angered she returns to her old gangster form and plots to kill Raja once and for all after learning he is the brother of her accomplices through a news clip. The brothers fake their death to lure Raja, who is then left for dead. He is saved by Krishna Murthy and Nikita. He stops the bad guys beating every one of them to death. Finally it is shown that after jail Raja married Nikitha with the help of Thangapazham.

She was nominated as head of the ZANU‚ÄìPF Women's League, and delegates to the party congress approved her nomination by acclamation on 6 December 2014. In becoming head of the women's league, she also became a member of the ZANU-PF Politburo. Since 2016, the first lady's involvement in ZANU-PF in-house politics has seen rumours pointing out that she is fronting one of the party's secretive factions, the G40 (Generation 40).\\"Team Lacoste vs G40: ED 'poisoning' triggers vicious fight\\". The Standard, 10 September 2017 The other faction, Lacoste, assumingly led by the Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Factionalism in ZANU-PF at the time centered mainly on the Mugabe succession question. The feud between Grace Mugabe and Mnangagwa reached a tipping point in late September 2017, with both parties pointing fingers to each other on ZANU PF public gatherings. While addressing an audience at Mahofa's memorial service, Mnangagwa claimed he was poisoned at a ZANU PF Youth Interface rally in Gwanda.\\"Mnangagwa admits he was poisoned\\". Bulawayo 24 News, 3 October 2017 Soon after Mnangagwa's remarks, President Robert Mugabe called a shock cabinet reshuffle in what many believe to be power-shifting exercise. Mnangagwa, like fellow suspected allies, lost the justice ministry. October 2017 marked Grace Mugabe's peak political influence in ZANU PF. In November 2017, Grace was instrumental in the firing of the then Vice-President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, after reprimanding him for causing divisions in Zanu PF. Shortly thereafter, Grace expressed her intentions of taking up the Vice-Presidency post. The country was in heightened tension and soon after that while Emmerson Mnangagwa had sought refuge outside of Zimbabwe, the military took over in a bloodless coup under General Constantino Chiwenga. Grace Mugabe was notably invisible at this time with various reports of her whereabouts. On 19 November, Grace Mugabe and 20 of her associates were expelled from the ZANU-PF. When Robert Mugabe died on 6 September 2019, both Mugabes were in Singapore. Sanctions After observers from the European Union were barred from examining Zimbabwe's 2002 elections, the EU imposed sanctions on 20 members of the Zimbabwe leadership and then, in July, extended them to include Grace Mugabe and 51 others, banning them from travelling to participating countries and freezing any assets held there. The United States instituted similar restrictions. Controversies With Robert Mugabe (on 4 August 2013) =Real estate= During her tenure as first lady, Grace Mugabe oversaw the construction of two palaces. The first, commonly referred to as \\"Gracelands\\", was criticised for its extravagance. Grace Mugabe later explained that she had paid for it with her own personal savings. It was later sold to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. The second was completed in 2007, costing around $50 million. The construction was funded by the ZANU-PF party to thank Robert Mugabe for his political service. In 2002, Grace Mugabe toured farm properties in Zimbabwe, looking for a new location for herself and her family. She chose the Iron Mask Estate, which had been previously owned by farmers John and Eva Matthews. The family owns property in Malaysia, and in early 2008, it was reported that Grace Mugabe hoped to move there with her children. The intention behind the move was to escape the stress of leadership and to address fears that the first family faces assassination. She also acquired property holdings in Hong Kong, including a diamond cutting business and a property at Tai Po, New Territories. IOL news speculated that this property acquisition was intended as both a weekend getaway for their daughter, Bona, who was studying at the University of Hong Kong under an assumed name, and that she and her husband expect to escape to China should they be ousted from power in Zimbabwe. Legislators of the pro-democracy movement urged the Hong Kong government to study whether to follow international practice in barring certain foreign politicians as many people might be looking at buying properties, investments, or education in Hong Kong. Lee Wing-tat said Beijing should be making the decision since this was a foreign affair. Spokesperson Jiang Yu from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said she was not aware of the Mugabes' alleged house purchase in Hong Kong and would not comment further. A professor at the University of Hong Kong said Beijing was trying to stay out of the controversy. The Beijing central government dismissed the concerns, adding that Falun Gong members were allowed to buy properties in Hong Kong. It was reported in 2015 that Zimbabwe was involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of the property in Tai Po in which Bona Mugabe had stayed whilst a student in Hong Kong. The property had been acquired in June 2008 through a company controlled by Taiwanese-born South African businessman Hsieh Ping-sung for HK$40 million ($5.14 million) and transferred into his own name in 2010. The Mugabes allege that the villa belonged to the Zimbabwean government, while Hsieh, who was once a Mugabe confidant, claims there was no question that the house belonged to him. =Diamond trade allegations and lawsuit= In December 2010 U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks brought up again earlier allegations that high-ranking Zimbabwean government officials and well- connected elites, including Mugabe's wife Grace, are generating millions of dollars in personal income by hiring teams of diggers to hand-extract diamonds from the Chiadzwa mine in eastern Zimbabwe. Grace Mugabe is currently suing a Zimbabwean newspaper over its reporting of claims released by WikiLeaks that she had made \\"tremendous profits\\" from the country's diamond mines. The president's wife is demanding $15m (¬£9.6m) from the Standard newspaper. =Shopping= Grace Mugabe is known for her lavish lifestyle, and Western media has nicknamed her \\"Gucci Grace\\". The Daily Telegraph called her \\"notorious at home for her profligacy\\" in the coverage of a 2003 trip to Paris, during which she was reported as spending ¬£75,000 (approx US$120,000) in a short shopping spree; and in the years leading up to 2004 withdrew over ¬£5 million from the Central Bank of Zimbabwe. When Grace Mugabe was included in the 2002 sanctions, one EU parliamentarian said that the ban would \\"stop Grace Mugabe going on her shopping trips in the face of catastrophic poverty blighting the people of Zimbabwe\\". She faces similar sanctions in the United States. =Education= Controversy ensued when Grace Mugabe was given a doctoral degree in sociology in September 2014 from the University of Zimbabwe two months after entering the programme. She was awarded the degree by her husband and University Chancellor Robert Mugabe. Her doctoral thesis was not published in the university archive along with other graduates and she has faced calls to return her PhD. The awarding of the degree caused a backlash in the Zimbabwean academic community, with some commenting that this could harm the reputation of the university. On 22 January 2018, the University website published Grace Mugabe's PhD thesis. Levi Nyagura, the vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, was arrested by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission to be charged with abuse of office following an investigation into the PhD. =Various assaults= Mugabe's reputation for violence and hot temper earned her the nickname of \\"Dis-Grace\\" at home. There have also been incidents abroad: The Times reported on 18 January 2009 that, while on a shopping trip in Hong Kong where her daughter Bona Mugabe was a university student, Mugabe ordered her bodyguard to assault Sunday Times photographer Richard Jones outside her luxury hotel. She then joined in the attack, punching Jones repeatedly in the face while wearing diamond encrusted rings, causing him cuts and abrasions. She was subsequently granted immunity from prosecution 'under Chinese diplomatic rules' because of her status as Mugabe's wife. In August 2017, while visiting South Africa to treat an ankle injury, Grace is said to have assaulted a 20-year-old model, Gabriella Engels, and two friends, who were in the company of her two younger sons, Robert Jr. and Chatunga, at a hotel in Sandton, Johannesburg. It is alleged that Grace hit the women and her sons, with an extension cord, causing various injuries including a deep gash on Engels' forehead. This was after accusing the women of living with her sons. After charges were laid by Engels for \\"assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm\\", Grace was due to appear at a Johannesburg court on 15 August 2017, but failed to do so; she was subsequently granted diplomatic immunity. After President Robert Mugabe got deposed by Emmerson Mnangagwa, Gabriella Engels posted a tweet vowing revenge on Grace Mugabe. On 30 July 2018, the South African High Court stripped Grace of her diplomatic immunity and allowed the case involving her assault against Engels to proceed. =Ivory smuggling= A police spokeswoman stated on 26 March 2018 that they were investigating a case of alleged ivory smuggling linked to Grace. The spokesman for Zimbabwe's national parks and wildlife agency stated that Mugabe and senior members of her staff had forced parks' officials to sign export permits for ivory pieces during her husband's presidency. =Mazowe Dam= In 2017, Grace's Mazowe Citrus Estate took control of 60 percent of the Mazowe Dam. On 24 August 2018. Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa issued a provision ordering the Mugabe family to vacate the Dam and return their share to the Environment, Water, and Climate Ministry.

As the publisher of Nostalgia Press, he pioneered the reprinting of vintage comic strips in quality hardcovers and trade paperbacks. As an editor and art director for two-and-a-half decades at Topps Chewing Gum, he introduced many innovations in trading cards and humor products. Gelman was the co-creator of Popsicle Pete and the co-creator of Bazooka Joe for Topps.Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.117, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, He was also a co-creator of Mars Attacks, adapted into the 1996 movie by Tim Burton.IMDb Born in Brooklyn, Gelman attended City College of New York, Cooper Union and Pratt Institute before signing on as an assistant animator, in-betweener and scripter with Max Fleischer's studio in 1939, continuing to write for Famous Studios in 1946. He is the uncle of the psychologist Susan Gelman and the statistician Andrew Gelman. Comic books and advertising Gelman was the creator and writer of funny-animal feature \\"The Dodo and the Frog\\" for DC Comics.The Dodo and the Frog at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Archived from the original on March 28, 2016. and other funny animal comic books of the 1940s, including Funny Stuff and Comic Cavalcade. He also wrote and drew the crime story, \\"The Kid from Brooklyn!\\", for Heroic Comics #32 (Sept. 1945). In 1945, Gelman teamed with Ben Solomon to form a New York advertising art service, Solomon & Gelman, to create advertising campaigns involving cartoon characters, such as their Popsicle Pete magazine and ads for the Popsicle company. Topps writer-editor Len Brown recalled how the partnership led to Solomon and Gelman to sign on full-time with Topps: Topps In the autumn of 1951, Gelman and Sy Berger, then a 28-year-old World War II veteran, designed the 1952 Topps baseball card set on the kitchen table of Berger's apartment on Alabama Avenue in the Broadway Junction section of Brooklyn. From 1953 to the late 1970s, Gelman headed Topps's Product Development Department, working with a staff that included associate creative director Len Brown, gagwriter Stan Hart, visual concept creator Larry Reilly, writer-cartoonists Art Spiegelman and Bhob Stewart, and designer-cartoonist Rick Varesi. Gelman assigned work to numerous freelance cartoonists, including Jack Davis, Mort Drucker, Jay Lynch, Bob Powell, John Severin, Tom Sutton, Basil Wolverton and Wally Wood. Beginning in 1967, Gelman supervised Wacky Packages, one of the biggest fads of the 1970s, and he was responsible for devising many other Topps cards, stickers, posters and humor products over decades.Wacky Packages, Abrams, 2008. Triple Nickel Books Gelman designed and published The Picture History of Charlie Chaplin in 1965 In 1955, the firm of Solomon & Gelman published a series of 64-page juvenile novelettes. Because they retailed for 15 cents, the line was called Triple Nickel Books. The first Triple Nickel Book was very successful, as it was based on the life of Davy Crockett when Crockett was a national fad. At the same time, they published two other Triple Nickel Books about the adventures of the Power Boys, juvenile fiction in the tradition of the Hardy Boys. At least eight Power Boys adventures were published under the pseudonym Arthur Benwood, a name created by combining the first names of Ben Solomon and Woody Gelman. The line includes The Secret of Crazy Cavern (1955), Riddle of the Sunken Ship (1955), Castle of Curious Creatures (1956) and Mystery of the Marble Face (1956). These books are included in the University of South Florida's Special Collections: Tampa Children's Literature Collection.University of South Florida's Special Collections: Tampa Childrens Literature Collection (The Triple Nickel titles are apparently unrelated to Mel Lyle's later and slightly better-known Power Boys series from the mid-1960s.) Nostalgia Press After doing a facsimile reprint of the 1945 Little Nemo in Slumberland softcover, with an August Derleth introduction, Gelman began Nostalgia Press in the early 1960s. One of the earliest Nostalgia Press books was The Picture History of Charlie Chaplin (1965), designed by Gelman and showcasing a large collection of rare Chaplin memorabilia.McDonald, Gerald. The Picture History of Charlie Chaplin. Nostalgia Press, 1965. In 1960, he was an associate editor of The American Card Catalog.Vrechek, George. \\"Jefferson Burdick's Collection and the American Card Catalog: The Greatest Collection That You Will Never See.\\" The first Nostalgia Press hardcover was Flash Gordon (1967), a reprint of Alex Raymond comic strips, and this book had a follow-up utilizing Flash Gordon proof sheets supplied to Gelman by the artist Al Williamson. Two years later, he compiled art by Charles Dana Gibson for The Best of Charles Dana Gibson (Bounty Books, 1969), with accompanying biographical material and an introduction by Gelman. Bill Gaines and Bhob Stewart selected 23 stories for the full-color EC Horror Comics Library of the 1950s; with introductions by Stewart and Larry Stark, this oversize (10\\" x 14\\") hardcover was published by Nostalgia Press in 1971. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips, first published in Italy. Gelman discovered original strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son worked in 1966. Many of the original drawings that Gelman recovered were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In the 1970s, Gelman did two collections of Scorchy Smith, and he moved into yet another area, publishing a magazine, Nostalgia, mainly devoted to reprints of comic strips. The first issue of his earlier magazine, Nostalgia Illustrated, was completed in 1967 as a dummy but was never published. Instead, Gelman sold the title and some material to Magazine Management, which did at least a dozen nationally distributed issues in the early 1970s. During the 1970s, he also published his Golden Age of the Comics series, reprinting such strips as Mandrake the Magician, Terry and the Pirates and Thimble Theatre. Other work by Gelman appears in Wacky Packages, published by Abrams in 2008. Films Robert Altman's live-action film Popeye (1980) is adapted from E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre comic strip. The screenplay by Jules Feiffer was based directly on Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye the Sailor, a hardcover reprint collection of 1936-37 Segar strips published in 1971 by Nostalgia Press. Tim Burton's film Mars Attacks (1996) was adapted from Topps 1962 Mars Attacks trading card series written by Gelman and Len Brown and illustrated by Wally Wood, Bob Powell and Norman Saunders. Awards In 1971, he was honored by the Academy of Comic Book Arts with Recognition for Preservation and Popularization of Comic Art. Gelman, who lived in Malverne, Long Island, maintained a collection of rare American and European periodicals dating back to the 19th century. His collection of Winsor McCay cartoons is housed in the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at The Ohio State University.The Woody Gelman Collection (catalog).

Plot 1100 Jefferson Street is not just any address; it‚Äôs everything for four friends bonded by both their circumstances and their struggle to make something, anything out of their seemingly predetermined fate. The crew played by Arlen Escarpeta, Cory Hardrict, Maurice McRae and Lorenzo Eduardo share one simple job description -- ‚ÄúDough Boys.‚Äù Corey, the all-around good guy with great potential (Escarpeta); Smooth, the ladies man, big dreamer and quintessential leader (Hardrict); Black, the eager-to-please skinny weed head (McRae) and Long Cuz, the skittishly annoying square trying to keep up with everyone else (Eduardo) form the group who make up their rules and moves as they go along. Drama can always be found among 1100 Jefferson Street‚Äôs day-to-day dealings down to the resident crack head that serves as both lookout and snitch and the good- hearted Beauty (Reagan Gomez-Preston) running a full-service hair salon out of her one-bedroom apartment. Meanwhile, Corey plays a balancing act with the streets and his future as he weighs the arguments of his girlfriend in one ear and mentor, Simuel ‚Äì played by Gabriel Casseus ‚Äì in the other to go back to school. But constantly calling Corey‚Äôs attention are the ‚ÄúDough Boys,‚Äù who dream big enough to spend their money before they get it and smoke their joints before they roll ‚Äòem. Although they shy clear of the drug game, the boys still do their streetwise duty in protecting the resident drug dealer in the building, played by Kirk Jones a.k.a. Sticky Fingaz. This is a loyal bond that pays off well. But their current ‚Äúhustle‚Äù of choice is flipping counterfeit casino chips in a limited market. The young men have obviously bit off more than they can chew and when their buyer Julian France, played by Wood Harris walks in it gets really interesting. Thus, the ‚ÄúDough Boys‚Äù fight to stay alive as the rules of the street that they live by consequentially are the very rules that begin to pull them under. The film also features performances by Ricky Harris, Kel Mitchell and Page Kennedy.

Born Ernest Nicolas in Saint Malo, France, he studied at the Paris Conservatory and made his debut in 1857, at the Op√©ra-Comique in Halevy's Les mousquetaires de la reine. After further study in Italy, he made his debut at La Scala in Milan in 1859, under the name Ernesto Nicolini, as Alfredo in La traviata, other roles there included Rodrigo in Rossini's Otello, and Elvino in Bellini's La sonnambula. On his return to France he sang at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien from 1862 until 1869. He made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London in 1866, as Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, without great success due to the pronounced vibrato that marred his singing. Five years later he returned to London to sing in Faust and Robert le diable at Drury Lane, and from 1872 appeared every season at the Royal Opera House until 1884; his roles there included Pery in Il Guarany, Radames in Aida, and the title role in Lohengrin. He created the role of Celio at the premiere of Charles Lenepveu's Vell√©da in 1882. During the season 1874‚Äì75, he appeared in St Petersburg and Moscow, opposite the world-famous soprano Adelina Patti, whom he would partner in almost all her appearances thereafter, accompanying her on concert tours of the major western European capitals (Vienna, Milan, Venice, Brussels, Berlin and so on), as well on tours of the United States and South America. While together in Paris in 1886, singing in Faust at the Grand Op√©ra, the two created something of a scandal by getting married; Patti had divorced her first husband, the Marquis de Caux, shortly before her wedding to Nicolini. Nicolini appeared on stage for the last time at Drury Lane in 1897, as Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia. He died the following year in Pau, France.

Description The community located on the La Sal Mountain Loop Road, some northeast of Moab. The nearest inhabited town is Castle Valley, about to the northwest. History A short-lived gold placer mining camp existed here in the 1860s, but the area was first settled by a prospector named Doby Brown in the late 1870s or early 1880s. By 1882 enough settlers had gathered to establish a post office. In 1888 when a local gold rush began at nearby Miners Basin, Castleton became important as a supply town. It had a general store, hotel, two saloons, and several other businesses. At its peak in 1895, the population exceeded that of Moab. In fact, when Grand County was organized in 1890, Castleton vied with Moab for the chance to be county seat. The Panic of 1907 closed down the area's mines, and soon ranchers were Castleton's only residents. By 1910 the businesses were gone, leaving only the post office, and the population had dropped to 50. In 1930 there were six residents. A few people stayed in the dead town for decades, but in 1967 the county commission officially vacated Castleton as an occupied town.

Its congregation grew out of earlier Shamokin churches and served the men that worked on the Danville and Pottsville Railroad. With Edward the Confessor as its patron saint, the first St. Edward's Catholic Church was built and then dedicated in 1840. In August 1866, a parish was established and its first pastor was appointed in September of that year. A larger church was completed by Thanksgiving 1866. Groundbreaking and construction of a third church began in 1872. The larger church, built out of local sandstone, was adorned with interior life-size paintings and frescoes. The church, which then served up to 1,400 people, was dedicated on June 6, 1880. It is within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg. St. Edward's was claimed by locals to be the first church in the world to use electric lighting. The electric current was provided by the Edison Illuminating Company of Shamokin and the light bulbs were installed under the supervision of Thomas Edison. The church operated a parochial school beginning in 1874. Run by the Sisters of Charity from Mount St. Vincent, New York beginning in 1875, it had 700 students and 14 teachers from the Sisters of Charity by 1911. The church was rededicated in 1969 following several 20th- century remodeling efforts that included the installation of stained glass windows, Carrara marble, and Stations of the Cross. The church was destroyed by a fire in 1971 and rebuilt over the next few years with parishioners having mass in the church‚Äôs school gym. St. Edward‚Äôs was part of a consolidation of churches in 1995 and renamed as Mother Cabrini Catholic Church. Early church history A need for a Catholic church began with Danville and Pottsville Railroad workers, many of whom were of the Catholic faith, who were brought in to build a railroad in the area. Starting in 1838 church services were held in the village of Shamokin, led by preachers from Pottsville and Minersville, Pennsylvania. A half acre of land was purchased on the west end of the village, where a wooden structure 20 feet by 32 feet was built by Stephen Bittenbender, Patrick Reilly, and Matthew Brannigan. Bishop Francis Kenrick of Philadelphia dedicated this as St Edward's Church on October 11, 1840. Reverend Michael Sheridan, pastor of St Joseph's Church in Danville, was in charge of the congregation from 1854 to October 1857. He was succeeded by Reverend Edward Murray who served as pastor until early summer of 1866. A parish was established in Shamokin in August 1866, with Father J. J. Koch appointed as its first pastor in September 1866. Construction on a second, larger St. Edward's church building was completed by Thanksgiving 1866. The congregation soon outgrew the building and in 1867 the building was enlarged. A parochial house was built on an adjoining lot in the spring of 1869. Construction and electricity Having planned for a new church for some time, Reverend Koch led the groundbreaking for a new church in September 1872. White cut sandstone from the Big Mountain area and other building stone from Edgewood Park (Shamokin Indian Park) was brought in on sleds during the winter of 1872‚Äì73. They were cut to size on site by a dozen laborers and the cornerstone was laid May 23, 1873. The roof was completed in 1873 or 1875. The first mass was held in the basement on Christmas and church services were held there until the entire building was completed. The church tower was completed in 1875 and four years later the interior was finished. The church tower, with four large bells weighing 8,500 pounds, was high. An artist from Philadelphia created the interior frescoes. A depiction of the Resurrection of Christ, surrounded by the four Evangelists, was created in a fresco on the ceiling. Works of art included life-size paintings of St. Edward, the patron of the church, St. Patrick, and The Crucifixion and were hung over the main altar. The twelve Apostles were painted on the walls. Father Kock imported two statues from France that sat on either side of the altar. They represented Christ meeting His Mother on His Way to Calvary and the Descent from the Cross. The church, which initially served up to 1,400 people, is located at Shamokin Street and Webster Street near downtown Shamokin. The third St. Edward's Catholic Church, within the Diocese of Harrisburg, was dedicated on June 6, 1880. An addition was built on the back of the building in 1882 to hold church records and vestments. The church received electric lights in 1883. Electric current to the church was supplied by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Shamokin. It was claimed by locals to be the first church in the world with electric lighting, although according to records of an Edison museum, St. Edward's was preceded in that regard by the City Temple church in London and a church, 1st Presbyterian, in Roselle, New Jersey. The Roselle electrical system was wired with a 330 volt system. The St. Edward Church was the first to be wired with a 110 volt system, which was then adopted throughout the United States. The lights of this church were first turned on September 22, 1883. The complete electrical project was engineered and supervised by Thomas Edison. Parochial school Father Koch organized a parochial school in 1874, which operated out of the 1866 church building. Initially, lay teachers taught the students. The Sisters of Charity from Mount St. Vincent, New York assumed supervision of the church in 1875, with four sisters placed at St. Edwards. A convent was built for them in 1877. A brick schoolhouse was completed in 1884 on a lot opposite the church. By 1911, there were more than 700 students who were taught by 14 Sisters of Charity. 20th- century remodeling In 1906, the church interior was remodeled to include stained glass windows and decorations by the Italian artist Baraldi. Until 1932 the church steeple was the tallest structure in the area, but lowered then by 100 feet. The church basement was converted into a social hall and additional interior remodeling ‚Äî including installation of Carrara marble for wainscoting, a communion railing, and altar ‚Äî was completed in 1938. An extensive remodeling project of 1968 and 1969 resulted in repairs to exterior stone walls and mortar joints and remodeling of the interior. Canterbury crosses were mounted at the Stations of the Cross. The modern English words from Matthew 11:28, Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest replaced the old Latin text spoken by Christ that was previously there. Other changes were the addition of symbols of the Trinity on the ceiling and other symbols put on the walls. A reproduction of Reubens' painting of the crucifixion of Jesus was added to the interior of the church. The church was rededicated in 1969. Fire of 1971 The 99-year-old structure, which was then serving 2,500 church members, burned down in 1971. The fire, so fierce that it required 200 volunteer firemen to fight the fire and save nearby structures, took down the church so that all that remained were the stone walls. The church was rebuilt over the next three years. The interior of the new church was built inside the walls of the original structure, which were all that remained after the 1971 fire. There was a formal dedication of the newly constructed building in October 1974, officiated by The Most Rev. Joseph Thomas Daley, D.D., the Bishop of the Diocese of Harrisburg. Mother Cabrini Catholic Church St. Edward's has historically had a congregation of German, Italian, and Irish members and priests who were Irish. Due to declining church membership, the need to redraw parish boundaries, and a need to pool resources‚Äîfive Catholic churches in the coal-mining region of Pennsylvania were consolidated in 1995 into the new Mother Cabrini parish. St. Edward's parish, which was central to the five churches, was renamed the Mother Cabrini parish for its patron saint, Frances Xavier Cabrini. As a result of the consolidation, the congregation became more diverse. It picked up members from the four Lithuanian, Polish, and Slovak churches. The Franciscan order that oversaw St. Stanislaus Church then oversaw the former St. Edward's, now Mother Cabrini, church building. In recognition of the region's coal mining history, the church has a Coal Altar. It participates in the town's annual Anthracite Heritage Festival.

It is located in the south-western corner of the former Township (and later, City) of Etobicoke on the shore of Lake Ontario. The Village of Long Branch was a partially independent municipality from 1930 to 1967. Long Branch is located within a land grant from the government to Colonel Samuel Smith in the late 18th century. After Smith's death, a small portion of it was developed as a summer resort in the late 1800s. Character Long Branch is primarily a residential district, composed mostly of single-family, detached homes. Along Lake Shore Boulevard West, numerous business are located in a low-rise commercial strip. South of Lake Shore Boulevard West, the area of single-family homes extends down to the lake. The area's lakeshore is primarily privately owned, except for Long Branch Park and Marie Curtis Park. Long Branch's population in 2011 was 9,625, a decline from 10,365 in 2001. The population has a higher proportion of working-age persons and lower proportions of children and seniors compared to the City of Toronto average. 65% of Long Branch persons indicate English as their mother tongue, with 31% having neither English or French to be the mother tongue of the household. The largest non-official language mother tongue is Polish at 6.3%, or 605 persons. The population has been relatively stable for several decades. The population of the Village of Long Branch was 9,616 in 1955. Boundaries Marie Curtis Park is a municipal park at western boundary of Long Branch. The park is situated along Etobicoke Creek. Long Branch is bounded by Lake Ontario on the south, with western boundaries of Etobicoke Creek north of Lake Shore Blvd. West and the western property line of the Canadian Arsenals Ltd. (Small Arms Ltd., WWII) (now within Marie Curtis Park) south of Lakeshore Road in Mississauga. The northern boundary is the Canadian National Railway's mainline, with the eastern boundaries being Twenty-Third Street south of Lake Shore Blvd. West, and the midpoint between Twenty-Second and Twenty-Fourth Streets north of Lake Shore Blvd. West.(Sources) Village of Long Branch City of Toronto Planning West District, map, Etobicoke Zoning Long Branch West (Dec 2007)http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/etobicokecodes/long-branch_west.pdf City of Toronto Planning West District, map, Etobicoke Zoning Long Branch East (Dec 2007)http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/etobicokecodes/long-branch_east.pdf History Before Long Branch became a village, it was the home to Loyalist Col. Sam Smith, who was one of the earliest settlers in Etobicoke. His cabin was located near Etobicoke Creek and survived into the 1950s. Col. Smith was granted a large tract of land for his service in the Queen's Rifles in 1797, which eventually extended from what is now Kipling Avenue to the original course of the Etobicoke River (now Creek), and south of Bloor Street to Lake Ontario after Col. Smith acquired additional parcels of land. The southern portion of this tract would include all of Long Branch and the westernmost portion of New Toronto, south of the railway line. The property was bought by James Eastwood from Col. Sam Smith's son, Samuel Bois Smith, in 1871. In 1883 Eastwood sold a portion of his land south of Lake Shore Road (now, Boulevard West) to a small group of financiers from Toronto. It was to be developed as a summer resort called 'Sea Breeze Park', and a plan of subdivision was filed in 1884. In 1886, the site was acquired by Thomas Wilkie and his brother and it was renamed 'Long Branch Park', after the seaside summer resort area of Long Branch, New Jersey where Thomas had vacationed. The central north‚Äìsouth street was originally named 'Sea Breeze Avenue', but was renamed as 'Long Branch Avenue'. In 1887, the 'Long Branch Hotel' was built, set back from the waterfront near Beach Road (now Lake Promenade) and Long Branch Avenue. It survived until 1958 when it was destroyed by fire. In 1891, the Long Branch post office was opened to serve the Long Branch Park summer resort. Beginning in 1910,Col Frederick Burton Robbins bought land from the Newborn, Appleby, Van Every Estates and other lots south of Lake Shore Road around Long Branch Park and began to subdivide The Heathy Home Lots were called 'Pine Beach' 'The Pines' 'Lakeshore Gardens' and 'Lakeshore Gardens Annex'. In the 1920s, the land surrounding the mouth of Etobicoke Creek, known as the \\"Etobicoke Flats\\", was sub-divided for cottages and housing. View of Long Branch Loop, 1935. Opened in 1895, the line was double-tracked in 1928 by the Toronto Transit Commission. In 1895, the Toronto & Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company radial railway's single-track service was completed along Lake Shore Road from New Toronto through Long Branch to the current location of Long Branch Loop. In 1927, this line was amalgamated by the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) and double-tracked in 1928. In 1915, the Long Branch Aerodrome was established to the west of the village in Toronto Township, today's Mississauga. The aerodrome was Canada's first and was operated by the Curtiss Flying School until 1917. In 1924, the Long Branch Racetrack was inaugurated just north of the town at Horner Avenue at Kipling. It was operated by the Orpen family until 1955 when it was sold. The track was closed and racing moved north to Woodbine Racetrack. Today's Canadian International Stakes was initially called the Long Branch championship and run at Long Branch. The Cup and Saucer Stakes also originated at Long Branch. The Village of Long Branch was incorporated in 1930, after the other lakeshore municipalities of Mimico (1917) and New Toronto (1920) were incorporated as towns. After the incorporation, some of its streets were given new names. In 1931, north-south street names were standardized by continuing the ordinal numbers of New Toronto's streets, picking-up at Twenty-Third Street in the east through to Forty-Third Street in the west. For example; Lansdowne Avenue became Thirty- Third Street and Lake View Avenue became Thirty-Fifth Street. Long Branch Avenue has remained the same (it could have been Thirty-Fourth St.). Thirty- Seventh St. was formerly called Robert Street, after Robert Eastwood. Today, a drugstore is located at the corner of Thirty-Seventh St. and Lake Shore Blvd. West on the site of the former Eastwood Park Hotel, which originally was the homestead built by Robert Eastwood on the occasion of his marriage to Elizabeth McGregor in 1911. Robert Eastwood died in 1925, and his widow, \\"Lizzie\\" sold the property and homestead to Paul and May Laurent of Church Street (now Royal Road) Mimico. Following the abolition of Prohibition, Paul and May obtained a liquor licence from the Province of Ontario and opened what would become a 25 room hotel with dining room and beverage rooms which would serve the people of Long Branch for 60 years until the Laurent family sold the business and property in 1987. Today, other local streets such as James Street still bear names of members of the Eastwood family. Twenty-third Street was called Government Road even after the 1931 incorporation. A cenotaph was raised on Long Branch Avenue south of Lake Shore in 1933 to commemorate the village's contributions during the First (and later, Second) World War. During the Second World War, many industries were opened between Lake Shore Road and the railway to the north as part of the Commonwealth war effort. The Small Arms Limited Long Branch Arsenal munitions factory was established during World War II to the west of the village, just north of the Aerodrome's location. In October 1954, Hurricane Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had travelled 1,100 km (680 mi) over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2009: $41.7 million) in aid. An example of a cottage built in the late-19th and early 20th century. A number of cottages and beach houses were destroyed in 1954, as a result of Hurricane Hazel. More than forty homes in Long Branch were lost at the mouth of the Etobicoke Creek due to flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel. Long Branch's dead from the hurricane were: Mr and Mrs Ed Crymble and their daughter Clifford; Patricia and Robert Thorpe; and Mrs. Thorpe's mother, Mrs. Robert Johnston. The Thorpe's baby daughter Nancy survived. The baby had been handed to 17-year-old Sylvia Jones while the area was being abandoned. Jones climbed onto a nearby roof and the two were later saved by fire fighters. The Thorpe's house was one of the ones washed away into Lake Ontario. Nancy Thorpe was later adopted by her aunt and uncle. The O'Farrell family escaped when their house floated down the river, by climbing onto trees that their house crashed into. Thirty-five persons survived on the roof of one house that was held back from Lake Ontario by two trees the house had crashed into. According to Long Branch Reeve Marie Curtis, \\"if it hadn't been for the trees, which held the houses back, half of them would have been swept out into the lake.\\" 147 cottages at the mouth were declared unfit for habitation after the flooding when sanitation facilities broke down. To prevent any future floods from having similar disastrous results, cottages and houses from the floodplain, the sand bar and around the mouth of the river were removed and the area was turned into parkland. In 1959, the park was named for village Reeve Marie Curtis in recognition for her longstanding municipal service and her efforts to have the park built. A trailer park north of Lakeshore Road, Pleasant Valley Trailer Park, was also destroyed when flooding caused a dike to break. The trailer park is now the site of Maurice J. Breen Park. Forty-Third Street, along the eastern bank of Etobicoke Creek, was closed up and only a stub north of Lake Shore Boulevard exists. West of Etobicoke Creek and south of Lakeshore Road is Island Road, which today is an access road for parking and a boat launch for Marie Curtis Park. It was built in the early 20th century to serve the sub-division built on the banks of the Etobicoke Creek and an island within the channel of the creek. As part of the park development, the island of Island Road became part of the west bank of Etobicoke Creek, as the western channel was filled in. At the same time, a sand bar at the mouth was connected to shore by fill. The sand bar is Marie Curtis Beach today. Etobicoke Creek originally turned at a right-angle to the west at the shore, but now is channelled straight out to the lake. A new section of Island Road was built to connect to Lakeshore Road to the north, as its prior connection to Forty-Third Street on the eastern bank was closed. St. Demetrius Ukrainian Orthodox Church was built in Long Branch in 1958. After World War II, an influx of immigrants from Europe came to Toronto. One of the largest Orthodox churches in Canada, St. Demetrius Ukrainian Orthodox Church (not to be confused with St Demetrius Byzantine Rite Catholic church, also in Etobicoke), was built on Lake Shore Road (now Blvd. West) opposite 27th Street in 1958. In 1967, the Village of Long Branch was amalgamated with the Township of Etobicoke to form the Borough of Etobicoke. That year, the new GO Transit commuter train service was established and the Long Branch GO Station was built next to Long Branch Loop, connecting Long Branch west to Oakville and east to downtown Toronto. The Borough became the City of Etobicoke in 1984. In 1998, Etobicoke was merged with five other municipalities and the Metropolitan Toronto government to form the new City of Toronto. In the late 1980s, some industry started to relocate out of Long Branch. Lake Shore Boulevard West today is a major thoroughfare and business strip in transition, with plans, some controversial, to change its character from a low-density industrial-commercial corridor to higher-density residential uses including some limited commercial space. =Historical sites= These sites are located on the former Federal Government lands, located south of Lakeview and west of Long Branch, in Mississauga, Region of Peel. Small Arms Limited, Long Branch Arsenal Adjacent to the western boundary of Marie Curtis Park (now Marie Curtis Park West) in Toronto Township is the former site of the Small Arms Limited Long Branch Arsenal. The Federal Government had owned the lands south of Lake Shore Road, between the Etobicoke River to just west of Cawthra Road, from the late 1800s into the early 20th- Century. The Ordnance Branch of the Department of National Defense authorized the construction of the factory in 1940. After transfer to the Department of Munitions and Supply, a Crown Corporation, Small Arms Ltd. was formed to operate the facility. By June 1941, the first five rifles had been produced. Huge quantities of British-pattern military small arms were manufactured there during the Second World War, including the No.4 MkI* Lee‚ÄìEnfield bolt-action rifle, and the Sten submachine-gun (or machine-carbine). Small Arms Ltd. ceased operations at the end of December 1945. Beginning January 1, 1946, operations continued as the Small Arms Division, Canadian Arsenals Limited. The factory was closed June 30, 1976. The property was later used by Canada Post as a distribution centre. The factory complex was demolished and the \\"Arsenal Lands\\" are now slated to become part of Marie Curtis Park West. The buildings of the office complex at the foot of Dixie Road have been saved for public use, while only the water tower remains from the factory complex. Long Branch Aerodrome Long Branch Aerodrome was an airfield in Long Branch, that operated from 1915 to 1919. The Long Branch Aerodrome was located west of Long Branch on the Federal Government lands in Toronto Township (today's Mississauga). The aerodrome was situated on a 100-acre property on Lakeshore Road just west of Dixie Road. The Long Branch Aerodrome has the distinction of being the first airport in Canada and home to Canada's first aviator training school. It opened on May 20, 1915, by Curtiss Aeroplanes and Motors Company for the Royal Flying Corps. Aircraft such as the JN-4 (Canadian) \\"Canuck\\" soon became a common sight at the airfield, which included three aircraft hangars. In January 1917, the newly designated Royal Flying Corps, Canada, a forerunner to the Royal Canadian Air Force, opened the RFC Training Centre at Long Branch. The Long Branch training centre also provided instruction on flying boats at nearby Hanlon's Point in Toronto Harbour, the first seaplane base in Canada. By July 1917, the flight school re-located to the Armour Heights Aerodrome. Long Branch became the Cadet Ground Training School for the Royal Flying Corps. Both the school and the aerodrome closed in 1919. During World War II, the former aerodrome served initially as 21 Non- permanent Active Militia Training centre and then as an army small arms training centre. After the war, the Lakeview Armoury was established on the site, but was demolished in the 1950s. Not the slightest trace remains of the airfield today. From 1958 to 2005, the waterfront portion of the property was the location of Ontario Power Generation's Lakeview Generating Station. In September 1969, a plaque was erected at the site to commemorate Canada's first Aerodrome. Education Vincent Massey Public School was an elementary school in Long Branch. Two public school board operates schools in Long Branch, the English first language Toronto District School Board, and the French first language Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CVS). Both school boards operate one institution in Long Branch, which provides primary education. They include: * √âcole √©l√©mentaire Micheline-Saint-Cyr (CSV) * James S. Bell Junior Middle School (TDSB) Vincent Massey Public School was formerly another elementary school operated by TDSB. Operating from 1929 to 1983, the building is presently used as a daycare and Nursery. Long Branch was previously home to one public school operated by the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), Christ the King Catholic School. However, in February 2018, the school was amalgamated along with St Theresa Catholic School into a new school in neighbouring New Toronto, known as The Holy Trinity Catholic School. The school is located east of Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School, a secondary school adjacent to Long Branch's eastern boundary. Transportation The western terminus for 501 Queen and 508 Lake Shore TTC streetcar lines is located in the neighbourhood, at Long Branch Loop. The Long Branch Loop is the western terminus for the 501 Queen and 508 Lake Shore TTC streetcar lines, connecting Long Branch to downtown Toronto. The Loop is also the terminus for the 110 Islington South and 123 Shorncliffe TTC bus lines. The MiWay Mississauga transit agency operates the 5 Dixie and 23 Lakeshore from the Loop west into Mississauga. Next to the loop is the Long Branch GO Station on the GO Transit Lakeshore West line. The major east‚Äìwest arterial road in Long Branch is Lake Shore Boulevard, which connects to the east to downtown Toronto. Lake Shore Boulevard West continues to the west as Lakeshore Road in Mississauga. The generally used north‚Äìsouth arterial roads are Brown's Line and Kipling Avenue, neither of which is within Long Branch (except a few metres at the southern end of Brown's Line, south of the railway tracks). Since there are no major north-south roads in Long Branch, these exterior roads are used to reach the Gardiner Expressway, Ontario Highway 427 and the Queen Elizabeth Way highways to the north.

The term as used by archaeologists is vague in regard to denomination. A single coin buried with the dead and made of silver or gold is often referred to as a and presumed to be a form of Charon's obol. Numismatists have also found the an elusive coin to identify, speculating that the Greeks used the term loosely for a demonetized coin of foreign origin.Ernest Babelon, entry on \\"Danak√©\\", Trait√© des monnaies grecques et romaines, vol. 1 (Paris: Leroux, 1901), pp. 514‚Äì518 full text online. In Persia, the was originally a unit of weight for bulk silver, representing one-eighth of a shekel (1.05 gm).A.D.H. Bivar, \\"Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures\\", in The Cambridge History of Iran (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, p. 622, citing the evidence of the Persepolis tablets. This use of the word became obsolete. In the Hellenistic period and later it designated the silver Attic obol, which originally represented the sixth part of a drachma; in New Persian d√¢ng means \\"one sixth\\".  Customary use  Charon receives a coin for the passage of a soul guided by Hermes (Mercury) as psychopomp. The is one of the coins that served as the so-called Charon's obol, which was placed on or in a dead person's mouth to pay the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead.Albert R. Frey, A Dictionary of Numismatic Names (New York 1917), p. 60.

Stevens, \\"Charon's Obol and Other Coins in Ancient Funerary Practice,\\" Phoenix 45 (1991), pp. 217, 219‚Äì220. Although Charon's obol is usually regarded as Hellenic, archaeology indicates that the rite of placing of a coin in the mouth of the deceased was practiced also during Parthian and even Sasanian times in the region that is present-day Iran. The coin, however, was customarily a drachma.A.D.H. Bivar, \\"Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures\\", in The Cambridge History of Iran (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, pp. 622‚Äì623, with citations on the archaeological evidence in note 5. In his entry on the , Hesychius implies that the coin was mentioned by Heracleides of Cyme in his lost work Persica around 350 B.C., placing its use (perhaps erroneously) in the Achaemenid period.A.D.H. Bivar, \\"Achaemenid Coins, Weights and Measures\\", in The Cambridge History of Iran (Cambridge University Press, 1985), vol. 2, p. 622. Bivar calls it a \\"bookman's notion\\" that was the correct name for the boat fare and blames a misunderstanding of a line in Callimachus.  Funerary context  Gold are frequently found in graves. In a Thessalian burial of the 4th century B.C., a gold had been placed on the lips of a woman, presumed from her religious paraphernalia to be an initiate into the Orphic or Dionysiac mysteries. The coin was stamped with a Gorgon's head.K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Par√°ssoglou, \\"Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly,\\" Hellenica 38 (1987) 3‚Äì16.

M. Stirling's Emberverse series of novels features several major and minor characters. Bearkillers * Mike Havel: Former US marine and pilot, Mike was flying a plane carrying the Larsson family to their vacation home in Montana when the Change happened. He became the leader of the Bearkillers, the name coming from the black bear he killed when it attacked their camp, and takes the group from Idaho to the Willamette Valley. He reluctantly tooks the title ‚ÄúLord Bear‚Äù after it is bestowed to him by Astrid along with a helmet with the tanned bear's head on it, the bear he killed with an improvised spear. He is described as fair but at the same time dangerous to his enemies. He disliked being the hero and often wished he could just be a farmer with his family, though he also admitted that he very much likes being the guy in charge, because then he can get things done without having to debate the issue. He died from injuries received in a duel with Lord Protector Arminger. He is husband to Signe Larsson, and father to their children: Ritva, Mary, Mike Jr. and unnamed twin girls with whom Signe was pregnant when Mike died. He is the father of Rudi after he and Juniper had sex shortly before he started dating Signe. * Kenneth Larsson: Father of the Larsson family and a wealthy industrialist and amateur engineer before the Change. His wife died shortly after the Change at the hands of white supremacists. Grateful to Mike for saving his children, Ken recognizes him as their leader in the post-Change world. His knowledge of engineering helped the Bearkillers develop a siege train and various farming tools. He lost one of his hands to Duke Iron Rod when the Duke attacked the Bearkillers. He sometimes had trouble adapting to the Change, one time worrying that Earth was doomed because there was no way to stop a meteor from hitting the planet. He is father to Eric, Signe, and Astrid and later marries Pamela and had several more children with her. He believes that it was aliens that caused the Change and referred to them as Alien space bats. * Signe Larsson: Daughter to Ken and sister to Eric and Astrid, Signe was a vegetarian before the Change, but quickly gave that up to survive. She fell in love and later marries Mike, sometimes being referred to as ‚ÄúLady Bear.‚Äù Signe handled the intelligence operations of the Bearkillers before becoming regent after Mike's death. She was wary of Rudi, fearing he would use his parentage as Mike's son to become Lord Bear and thus take away the chance for her son. She did, however, donate blood to save his life once. She later became a neopagan but does not become a Wiccan, preferring a Norse pantheon consistent with her Swedish ancestry. She is the mother of Ritva, Mary, Mike Jr., unnamed twin girls with whom Signe was pregnant when Mike died‚Äîfathered by Mike Havel‚Äîand an unnamed child which Eric Larsson assumes is fathered by Bjarni Eriksson. Eric relayed this assumption to Rudi Mackenzie in The Given Sacrifice. * Eric Larsson: Brother to Signe and Astrid, and son to Ken, Eric looked up to Mike as an older brother, though at one point he tried to fight Mike for looking at his sister too much. He usually commanded the Bearkiller cavalry during battle. He could be headstrong and quick to anger and had the tendency to suggest frontal attacks during strategy sessions. He did have a sense of humor and enjoys teasing his sisters, especially Astrid for her love of the Lord of the Rings. He is married to Luanne and has several children with her. By CY 22 (Change Year) he is in command of the entire Bearkiller military and leads the Bearkiller contingent during the Meeting's attempt to capture Pendleton where he loses a hand, earning the sobriquet \\"Ironfist\\" for his prothesis as well as relentless combat leadership. * Will Hutton: An African-American horse rancher who also appeared several rodeos in and around Texas. Right after the Change, Will and his family are themselves captured by a group of white supremacists. After being freed by Mike, Will and his family joined up with Mike and the Larssons and became an important founding member of the Bearkillers and Mike's second in command. His knowledge of horsemanship helps mold the Bearkillers into a skilled cavalry force. Though Mike had suggested several times that Will would make a better leader then him, Will had declined the position because he didnt think he is crazy enough for it. Ironically after Mike's death he became leader of the Bearkillers for a time before being replaced by Signe. In Dies the Fire, it was stated that he has a son serving with the US military in Italy. In The Scourge of God, Melissa Aylward, a member of Clan Mackenzie, had a vision of an unnamed man with a Texan accent, who might be Will's son, giving military advice at the bedside of a dying pope. * Angelica Hutton: Wife to Will and mother to Luanne. She became the Bearkiller trail boss and later head of logistics when they settle in Oregon. Because of her Hispanic origin she had a tendency to use Spanish words in everyday conversations, a characteristic picked up by a lot of Bearkillers. * Luanne Hutton: Daughter to Will and Angelica. For a time she was good friends with Astrid until Astrid saw her making out with Eric, whom she later marries. Because of her family connections Luanne is a part of the Bearkiller high command and usually accompanied Eric into battle. She has had several children through Eric. * Pamela Arnstein: A Californian veterinarian and renaissance reenactor, Pamela became stranded in Idaho after the Change. One of the first recruits to the Bearkillers, her knowledge of swordsmanship quickly made her an important member of the Bearkillers, training everyone how to fight with a sword. She later married Ken and commanded his bodyguards when he led the Bearkiller siege train into battle. * Aaron Rothman: Aaron is a doctor who was rescued by Mike from a band of cannibals, but not before they had cut off his foot for their stew. Thanks to his knowledge of medicine Aaron had been able to train the medics of the Bearkillers and usually travelled with the Bearkiller army during war to take care of the wounded. Aaron is gay and has a long term but unrequited crush on Mike, which is expressed by the fact that all of his boyfriends tend to look like the Bearkiller leader. * Mike Havel Jr.: Mike Jr. is the son of Mike and Signe. He was only a toddler when his father died in the duel with Lord Protector Arminger. He was being groomed by his mother to become the next Lord Bear. After saving Eric's life outside Pendleton he was promoted to the rank of A-lister and offered the chance to become Lord Bear by the Bearkillers. He declined the offer saying he still had more to learn from his mother and uncle. Unlike his mother, he had a near hero-worship for his brother Rudi McKenzie. * Astrid Larsson: Sister of Signe and Eric, sworn blood sister of Eilir Mackenzie. See D√∫nedain Rangers, below. * Will Larsson: Son of Eric Ironfist and Luann, like his cousin Mike was promoted to the A-List early for heroism on the Pendleton battlefield. Clan Mackenzie * Juniper Mackenzie: Folk singer and Wiccan priestess, Juniper fled Corvallis after the Change to her country home where she formed Clan Mackenzie from the members of her coven and other refugees. There was a possibility that she may have magical abilities but that has yet to be verified. When she met Mike they had a sexual encounter which produced her son and second child Rudi, named after her dead boyfriend who was killed when his plane crashed when the Change happened. Considered by many Wiccans to be the ‚ÄúGoddess on Earth‚Äù her actions had helped spread the Wiccan religion across the Willamette Valley and beyond. She had a moral force that would leads her to become the de facto leader of the non-Portland Meeting groups, and developed a cordial relationship, almost a friendship, with Sandra Arminger after the duel at the Fields of Gold. She is mother also to Eilir and wife to Sir Nigel Loring, by whom she had two more daughters. The songs & lyrics attributed to Mackenzie in the books are Heather Alexander's; Alexander was credited in the acknowledgments of The Protector's War. * Rudi ‚ÄúArtos‚Äù Mackenzie: Rudi is the son of Juniper and Mike, born shortly after the Change. He was the tanist or heir of Clan Mackenzie. Several prophecies and strange events have followed Rudi, one such prophecy leading him and his friends on a quest across North America to Nantucket to retrieve a sword. He had been described as an incredibly skillful fighter for his age, with an almost inhuman deadliness with a blade that comes as a very unwelcome surprise those who meet him in battle. He is also one of the few who could approach his horse, Epona, without being attacked. He had a close, almost romantic, relationship with Mathilda that causes him grief since their different religions and political situations made it unlikely they will ever be together. One reviewer called Rudi noble, complex, and admirable. To bring this up to date: Rudi _was_ the Tanist but gave up that position when it became clear that he would be High King, over all of the lands around Montival and just the leader of the Clan. His sister became Tanist. * Dennis Martin: A bar owner before the Change, Dennis accompanied Juniper to her country home, bringing with him medieval weapons given to him by his brother John, another character from Island in the Sea of Time. He had some skill as a blacksmith but was an even better woodworker. He became a convert to Wicca and was responsible for members of the Clan calling Juniper ‚ÄúLady Mackenzie‚Äù after he jokingly referred to her by that title. He was the first one to wear the famous Mackenzie kilt, and though it began as a joke to take people's minds off the Dying Time, he was basically responsible for instigating the neo- Celtic culture that came to define the MacKenzie Clan. * Chuck Barstow: Chuck was an SCA member and a gardener before the Change. He was responsible for leading a large number of Juniper's coven to the safety of her cabin and saving several school children from an abandoned bus, three of which he adopted. He was Second Armsman of the Clan under Sam until eventually being promoted to First Armsman after Sam retired. He died outside of Pendleton but later awoke somewhere in the afterlife. He was married to Judy and they had several children. * Judy Barstow: Judy was Juniper's teenage friend and both converted to Wicca together. As an adult she became a nurse midwife and married Chuck. Her skills with medicine made her the Clan's lead Healer and also one of Juniper's closest advisors. * Oak Barstow: Oak was one of Chuck and Judy's adopted children, who took the name Oak after converting to Wicca. He was Chuck's second-in-command outside of Pendleton and ordered the Mackenzie's to retreat after Chuck's death. During a burial ceremony held outside Dun Juniper, he swore in front of everyone present that he would avenge his father's death. * Sam Aylward: A former member of Special Air Service, Sam was hunting in Oregon during the Change and initially thought the Change was a nuclear war. He was later rescued by Juniper, who found him after he had fallen into a ravine. His skills as a bowyer helped make the longbow the weapon of choice for the Mackenzies. Though he defeated any attempts to be promoted to an officer while in the British military, he found himself ‚ÄúFirst Armsmen‚Äù of the Clan. His reputation as a phenomenal shot with a longbow earned him the nickname ‚ÄúAylward the Archer‚Äù and a reputation that had reached as far east as Boise, Idaho. He was father to Edain. This character was a reference to Aylward from Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. * Sir Nigel Loring: An officer who served in the Special Air Services as Sam's former commanding officer, a colonel in the Blues and Royals at the time of the Change. Nigel was responsible for saving the British Royal Family and helping the remnants of the United Kingdom get through the Change. Disputes with the King Charles III and his new wife, however, forced him to flee the country with his son Alleyne and John Hordle after his wife Maude was killed during their escape from Woburn Abbey. Picked up by a Tasmanian ship on a round-the- world expedition, he eventually found himself in Oregon and was offered land and title by Norman Arminger, Lord Protector of the Portland Protective Association, but fled after tricking him out of the recovered nerve gas Arminger wanted for his war against the rest of the Williamette Valley communities. He later settled among the Mackenzies and fell in love with Juniper and had two daughters by her. In battle he commanded the Mackenzie infantry that does not use the longbows and dresses in a full suit of plate armour. He is credited with instilling strict discipline among the Mackenzie warriors. This character is a reference to Nigel Loring from Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. * Edain Aylward: Edain is the son of Sam and joined Rudi on his quest to Nantucket. Though an accomplished archer himself, Edain found himself constantly reminded of his father's reputation as an archer, a fact which weighs heavily on the young man. He was intensely loyal to Rudi, referring to him as ‚ÄúChief‚Äù even though Rudi had yet to obtain that position. * Eilir Mackenzie: Deaf daughter of Juniper and sworn blood-sister of Astrid Larsson. See the D√∫nedain Rangers, below. * Terry Martin: Step-son of Dennis Martin and a noted brewer. Portland Protective Association (PPA) * Norman Arminger: The megalomaniac Lord Protector of the Portland Protective Association. Before the Change he was a history professor and member of the Society for Creative Anachronism. He built the PPA with members from the Society and various gang leaders of Portland. He was labeled a sociopath and could be cruel to both his enemies and his own people, having reintroduced slavery into North America. It has been assumed by others that Norman sees everything he does as a game and nothing is actually real to him. In spite of his faults his actions allowed hundreds of thousands of people in Oregon survive the events after the Change. He is husband to Sandra and father to Mathilda. He was killed by Mike Havel in a duel. * Sandra Arminger: Wife to Norman and mother to Mathilda and Regent of the PPA. She is the brains behind her husband's brawn. She is usually a voice of reason among the PPA, but has shown to be just as cruel, if not more so, than her husband. She is highly protective of her daughter, but at the same time not ashamed to arrange for ways to manipulate her into marrying the right husband. She created a group of household soldiers out of orphans that Tiphaine was a part of. She is fond of Rudi and has created a good working relationship with Juniper, even though neither would call themselves friends. * Mathilda Arminger: The daughter of Norman and Sandra and heir to the throne of the PPA, which she will inherit on her 26th birthday. She is currently traveling with Rudi on his quest to Nantucket. Mathilda is sometimes ashamed of her father, rationalizing the evil he did as being necessary. She sometimes worries she will make the same mistakes as Lord Protector. She is good friends with Rudi, a relationship that began when she was held captive by the Mackenzies. Though both seem to show deeper feelings for each other beyond friendship, despite their different religions and positions as heirs to their parents, she becomes betrothed to Rudi in the events of The Sword of the Lady * Conrad Renfrew: The Count of Odell, formerly commander of the PPA military and current Lord Chancellor to Regent Arminger. He is recognized by his heavily scarred face. Conrad was a friend of Norman before the Change and was his earliest supporter even coming up with the title Lord Protector. He may have been a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, but he refuses to talk about those years, causing some to even doubt if Conrad is his real name. He was a CPA before the change, which comes in handy in his current position of Lord Chancellor. He tends to be less bloodthirsty than Norman and openly disagrees with him if he feels he is wrong. He has a humorous side, once playing a prank on Norman by making him think the Change had been reversed. He personally trained Tiphaine to be his successor, but often argues with her on whether the PPA should adopt pikes. * Eddie Liu: A former gangbanger who moved up quickly in the ranks of the PPA to become the Baron of Gervais. Eddie had a grudge against Juniper who killed his friend while they were looting a store in Corvallis shortly after the Change. For a time he acted as Norman's agent when dealing with warlords like Duke Iron Rod before being promoted to command the defenses of the PPA's southern border. He was killed attempting to retrieve of book of secret codes that was accidentally given to Rudi. He is father to Odard Liu and husband of Lady Mary Liu, who is regent of Barony Gervais after her husband's death. * Odard Liu: The son of Eddie Liu and Baron of Gervais in the PPA. Odard is a highly ambitious man who spends time with Mathilda in hopes they will be married and he could then become Lord Protector and that is why he accompanied her on Rudi's quest to Nantucket. Regardless of his ambitions he has shown romantic feelings toward Mathilda and has created a reluctant friendship with his rival Rudi. Odard also has problems with his mother, Lady Mary, who is constantly undermining his authority as a baron. He is killed in battle with Moorish corsairs shortly before Rudi's group reaches Nantucket. * Mack: A former gangbanger and bodyguard to Eddie. Mack is recognized by his huge size and the large war hammer he carries. He preferred to allow Eddie to all of the talking. He dies defending Eddie. * Tiphaine d'Ath: Formerly an assassin for Sandra, she now commands the entire PPA military force. A teenager at the moment of the Change, she became sponsored by Sandra after she successfully snuck into the bedroom she shared with Norman asking for a job. She has a grudge against Astrid for killing her lover, but later forgives her though she still intensely dislikes her. She kidnapped Rudi once and became very fond of the boy, risking almost certain death to defend him against assassins sent by Norman. She mentions that her style of leadership involves killing anyone who disagrees with her. As a lesbian she is forced to keep her sexual orientation secret from the conservative Catholic state of the PPA, though most of those in power know and don't care. Also known as \\"Lady Death.\\" * Alex: Is a servant/bodyguard to Odard and joined him on Rudi's quest to Nantucket. Alex is very loyal to Odard's mother, seeing her as the reason he and his family survived the Change. He is under orders from her to protect Odard at all costs. He turned Mathilda and Odard over to CUT soldiers in order to prevent Odard from possibly dying in a battle. * Duke Iron Rod: A former biker who led his gang to take over a convent in Idaho after the Change. For a short time he was allied with the PPA. His gang was defeated by the Bearkillers and he was executed by hanging for his crimes. * Lady Mary Liu: Lord Odard's mother and Eddie's widow, Dowager Baroness of Gervais. A friend of Norman and Sandra from before the Change, and a member of the SCA, she has come to guard her noble privileges excessively. Although she is Sandra's friend, Sandra is often suspicious of Mary's motives. Mary convinces Odard's manservant Alex to protect Odard at whatever cost, despite Odard being his feudal lord. Mary has undercover dealings with the CUT. * Delia Mercer: A maid and closet both lesbian and Wiccan, becomes the de facto wife of Tiphaine and de jure wife of Rigoberte, Baron Forest Grove and Marchwarden of the South. Known for her sense of fashion, she becomes a member of Sandra's inner circle. * Rigobert de Stafford: A junior intelligence agent before the Change, Rigoberte becomes one of Sandra's \\"Sailor Moon\\" squad of commandos, rising to the rank of Baron Forest Grove and Marchwarden of the South. A closet homosexual, his \\"marriage\\" to Deliah provides cover to both him and Tiphaine in the homophobic environment of the PPA, developing into one of Tiphaine's few close friendships. Serves as Tiphaine's executive officer in the Walla Walla campaign. D√∫nedain Rangers * Astrid Larsson: Daughter to Ken and sister to Eric and Signe. She is obsessed with J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, an obsession that helped her survive after the Change. She even refers to the books as ‚Äúhistories.‚Äù Astrid was originally a member of the Bearkillers and is responsible for Mike being called Lord Bear, but later left to form the Rangers with Eilir. She is married to Alleyne and has had several children with him. When she heard about Rudi's quest she became very angry that she couldn't go because of her responsibilities to the Rangers and her family. Astrid is named after Poul Anderson's daughter and one reviewer found her outlook on life is similar to that of the author. Another reviewer found that Stirling made Astrid to be \\"a reader surrogate, with her love of fantasy\\" and also commented that Stirling \\"succeeds wildly in imbuing her with the kind of inspirational, bright-eyed youthful optimism that sees everyone else through the grimmest crises.\\" * Eilir Mackenzie: Daughter to Juniper, she was born deaf and had to learn sign language to speak. Originally a member of Clan Mackenzie, like Astrid she left her group to form the Rangers. She tends to be the more rational one of the pair, often having to remind Astrid that they are not in one of her stories. She is also less prudish than Astrid and thought that Astrid would be less uptight if she had sex. She was interested in Alleyne when they first met but he was interested Astrid, a situation that made Eilir jealous of her friend. After a while, she married John Hordle. * Alleyne Loring: Son to Nigel and husband to Astrid. Alleyne helped his father rebuild post-Change Britain thanks to his knowledge of medieval warfare. He is close friends with John from their time in the military. He accompanied Nigel on his exile, following him to Oregon. He joined up with the Rangers in an effort to get closer with Astrid. Though he eventually married Astrid and had children with her, he has worried about her obsession with The Lord of the Rings. Like his father, he usually goes to battle in full plate armour. * John Hordle: A former British soldier whose life was saved after the Change by Nigel. John jokingly accuses Sam of tricking him into joining the Special Air Services by lying to him about how good military life was. John is distinguished by his huge size and Eilir has once referred to him in sign language as her ‚Äúexcessively large boyfriend.‚Äù Like Sam he is an excellent shot with the longbow. He is known to go into battle loudly cursing his opponents instead of shouting a battle cry like everyone else. He is married to Eilir and has had couple of children with her. * Ritva and Mary Havel: The twin daughters of Mike and Signe. Though they grew up among the Bearkillers, they joined the Rangers. Both are accomplished scouts and due to their extensive training together are usually paired up in battles. As identical twins they enjoy pestering people by trying to get them to guess which one is which and also often finish each other's sentences. They are close friends with their half brother Rudi and joined him on his quest to Nantucket. Mary lost an eye in a battle with a CUT sorcerer-priest and wears an eye patch. Mary has developed a relationship with Ingolf and in the events of The Sword of the Lady becomes his wife. Other members: * Reuben Hutton (formerly Waters) was adopted into the Hutton family shortly after the Change took effect when both his parents were killed in a raid by Duke Ironrod, which was facilitated by his father, Billy Waters. He is killed in action during a skirmish with Protectorate forces. * Kevin Lewis is the D√∫nedain Ranger medic. He uses his medical knowledge to tend to Rudi's sustained injuries after the ensuing battle to recapture Mathilda Arminger by Eddie Liu. * Crystal, a junior probationary member of the Rangers, trains with Eilir in swordplay at Ranger Headquarters. Corvallis * Luther Finney: An elderly farmer who lived near Corvallis and friend of Juniper. After being warned about what the Change really was, he saved his son and his family from the city they were living in before the food ran out. He became an important member of the Corvallis government thanks to his knowledge of farming and opposed the PPA and argued that Corvallis should support the other factions fighting them. Because of his religious upbringing he refused to swear around women, though often this proved difficult considering the situation. He died while working on his farm on a July day, fulfilling a promise he made after coming back from the Korean War to die on his farm on the hottest day he ever experienced. * Edward Finney: Luther's son whom he saved from his city home. Edward took over his father's farm after he died and continues to wield the same influence his father did in Corvallis. * Peter Jones: A graduate student at Oregon State University before the Change, Jones became the leader of Corvallis militia. He holds the rank of Major and can usually be seen wearing wrap-around sports goggles when he is in battle dress. He is distrustful of the PPA and argued for Corvallis to ally with the other factions fighting them. He led a \\"volunteer\\" force to help the Bearkillers in their battle against an invading PPA army after the Corvallis government refused to get involved in the war. Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT) *Sethaz: Prophet of the CUT at the time of Sunrise Lands. Sethaz is a vicious man who is known to enjoy violence and death. He sees himself as the ‚ÄúScourge of God‚Äù sent to rid the Earth of those who have sinned. He experiences strange visions, for example knowing his father had died even though he was miles away from him, and like Juniper may or may not use magic. He fears Rudi and seeks to kill him before he completes his quest. Some characters believe he is being influenced by a dark power. *Joseph Kuttner: High Seeker of the CUT. Kuttner is a personal agent of Sethaz and once infiltrated the government of Iowa so as to get them to send him on Ingolf's expedition to the eastern death zones. Kuttner lost his eye to a vengeful Ingolf. He was later tasked to track down Rudi and kill him, but was killed himself. *Major Graber: Officer in the Sword of the Prophet, the elite of CUT. Originally he was an orphan who was raised by CUT to be a soldier. He is tasked by Sethaz after the fall of Twin Falls to track down and kill Rudi. Though a firm believer in his faith he sometimes expresses doubts about the role of the High Seekers and is bothered by the fact that Rudi did not kill him when he had the chance. Mount Angel * Abbot Dmwoski (spelled \\"Dmowski\\" in The Protector's War): A former soldier who joined the Benedictine monks of Mount Angel to get away from war. Ironically, after the Change he was promoted to Abbot due to his experience in warfare. Reluctantly accepting his new responsibility, Dmwoski turned the monks and sisters of Mount Angel into a fighting force to protect the refugees who came flooding into their lands and to keep Mount Angel from falling under the yoke of the PPA. He has mentioned that he dislikes life as the leader of Mount Angel and wishes to return to the quiet life as a monk. He was also the one who ordered Ignatius to follow Rudi on his quest to Nantucket. * Father Ignatius: Belongs to the Order of the Shield of St. Benedict. His original name, or baptismal name, was Karl Bergfried. A sword-brother of Mount Angel of Vietnamese descent. Father Ignatius was given the task to help Mathilda escape the PPA so she could join Rudi on his quest and keep an eye on both of the heirs. He has also at times counsels Mathilda while she struggles over her feelings about Rudi. Though he believes strongly in God, he often uses reason and logic to argue against the Mackenzie idea of magic. United States of America (Boise) * President Thurston: A former member of the US military who is now President of the United States (Boise). Though never officially elected president, he sees it as his duty to reunite the United States. He refuses to recognize the other nations as legal governments and can be stubborn about this, once refusing to aide New Deseret against the CUT unless they agreed to join the US. Once proven wrong, however, he easily admits he is at fault, a trait admired by Rudi. He is father to both Martin and Frederick. Martin ended up killing him because he planned to step down as president and hold elections. * Martin Thurston: President Thurston's elder son and brother to Frederick. Martin was horrified by the thought of his father allowing the next president to be elected and thought it should pass to him and his children. He conspired with the CUT to kill him and was forced to do the act himself which left him mentally unstable. He has assumed the position of president and appears to be about ready to openly ally with the CUT. * Frederick Thurston: President Thurston's younger son and brother to Martin. He witnessed Martin killing his father and was rescued from a similar fate by Rudi. Frederick now has become a rallying symbol for those who oppose Martin's regime. He is √Åsatr√∫ and specially follows Odin. Empire of Japan * Reiko: The current Empress of Japan, following the death of her father in his quest to recover Kusanagi-no- Tsurugi, Reiko has become friendly with Rudi and Mathilda's daughter Orlaith and enlisted her help. British Empire * Charles IV: The fictional son of William V. He would serve as the King of Great Britain and Emperor of the West from 2039 until his death in 2066. * Elizabeth III: The daughter of Charles IV. She would serve as the Queen of Great Britain and Empress of the West from 2066 to 2098. Other characters * Ingolf Vogeler: Mercenary from Kickapoo, Wisconsin in the Free Republic of Richland. Ingolf was the son of a sheriff, but after his brother assumed the position Ingolf angrily left to seek out life as a mercenary and later scavenger of the dead zones. He eventually commanded his own company, Vogeler's Villains, and was hired by the Governor of Iowa to seek out rare treasures in the eastern death zones with promises of land and his daughter's hand in marriage. Ingolf was given a vision on Nantucket to seek out Rudi in the west. Before he could do this he was betrayed and his men killed by Kuttner and the CUT. He managed to escape and warn Rudi and now follows him back east to Nantucket. He develops an interest in Mary Havel. * Kaur and Singh: Sikh brother and sister and mercenary scout in Vogeler's Villains. They sacrificed themselves to buy Ingolf more time to flee Kuttner and he promised to avenge their deaths. Their names mean ‚Äúlion‚Äù and ‚Äúlioness‚Äù in their native tongue. * Maude Loring: The late wife to Nigel. She was killed while she was attempting to flee Britain with her husband. Nigel named one of his daughters with Juniper after her. * Virginia Kane: Daughter of a rancher who was killed by CUT-supported ranchers. She meets up with Rudi and his band after fleeing from a rancher who wants to force her to marry him. Virginia will later scalp said rancher after a skirmish between CUT forces and Rudi's party allied with a Lakota scouting patrol led by their Itancan John Red Leaf. She develops an interest in Frederick. * Anthony Heasleroad: \\"Bossman\\" of Iowa, who took upon himself dictatorial powers after the death of his father, the first bossman following the Change. He rules autocratically and may appear to be mentally unstable at times. * Red Leaf: Sioux chieftain who shelters Rudi and company from the CUT. After the Change he had a major role in returning the Sioux to their nomadic roots and made them a major power on the Great Plains. Red Leaf was good friends with Virginia Kane's father and adopts Rudi and the others into the tribe. * John Brown: Rancher of Seffridge Ranch and important member of CORA. After the Change, John Brown allowed refugees from the towns to live on his ranch to support themselves as long as they worked for him. He is a longtime ally of Clan Mackenzie, leading a force of CORA horsemen to fight the PPA in the last war even though most of CORA stayed neutral. Once Mike went undercover pretending to be him in an effort to track down a brigand named Crusher Bailey. Rudi stopped by his ranch on his quest and John allowed them to travel with his son as they escorted horses to Deseret. * BD: A Kyklos merchant in the Pacific Northwest, BD is also a Wiccan and often works as an intelligence agent for the members of the Meeting. She was part of Astrid's team to kidnap the bossman of Pendleton and helped smuggle their weapons into the city. She is notable for originally appearing in the Emberverse fan fiction The Bonds of Kinship (2006) by Kier Salmon and Tarl Neustaedter, before appearing in The Scourge of God. * Jake sunna Jake: Big man of the Southside Freedom Fighters, now-grown youths who were brought out of Chicago by old Jake his father, shortly after the change. Rudi encounters them in the Wild Lands, befriending him and eventually adopting his entire tribe. Killed in battle on the Great Lakes. Contemporary non-fictional people * Elizabeth II: The Queen fled to the Isle of Wight with the rest of the British Royal Family on the third day after The Change occurred. However, she died shortly thereafter in December 1998. * Tony Blair: The Prime Minister was supposed to be escorted to the Isle of Wight, but something delayed him. He continued to send messages promising to leave shortly until all contact was lost with him and his party. He is now presumed dead. * Charles III the Mad: Ascended the throne of Britain after the death of his mother Elizabeth II in December 1998, Charles led the remnants of Britain through the early years after the Change. His knowledge of organic farming (which he had been experimenting with since the early 1980s) helped the survivors with their food problems. He later married an Icelandic refugee, who was popularly blamed for manipulating him. In his later years he went insane and refused to have new elections for parliament and instead ruled by royal decree, which eventually caused a rift between him and Nigel. Officially, he died in 2008 of a stroke but it was a common rumor that he was killed by his wife who wanted to assume power for herself and her infant son. * William V the Great, King of Great Britain and Emperor of the West: Son to Charles, after the Change William went to serve in the military. Nigel saved his life in a battle with pirates during this service. He became king in 2008 after the death of his father and after defeating a coup by his stepmother. He personally led a \\"crusade\\" against Moorish pirates off the Canary Islands and on his return was crowned Emperor of the West. Under his leadership the British Empire was reborn. He tried unsuccessfully to convince Nigel to return to Britain by promising him wealth, land, and title. He would serve as king from 2008 until his death in a fox-hunting accident in 2039. * Theodore Kaczynski (aka the UNABomber): Kaczynski escaped prison and fled California shortly after the Change arriving in Paradise Valley, Montana. He became the prophet or leader of CUT, passing on his anti-technology philosophy to his followers. He too went insane but was still seen by CUT as their leader and continued to seek his advice by having his son Sethaz commune with him. When he died, Sethaz somehow knew even though he was miles away from his father. * Pope John-Paul II : Instead of surviving for another seven years until his death in 2005 in our timeline, Pope John-Paul II died in the Vatican, refusing to leave the Holy City after ordering the Swiss Guards to escort the other Vatican survivors out of Rome. * Pope Benedict XVI: Having fled Rome for Umbria, Cardinal Ratzinger was elected pope several years earlier than in our timeline after the links were once again restored to the communities of the Roman Catholic Church. As pope he helped reunite the Church of England with the Roman Catholic Church. Abbot Dmwoski was particularly happy to learn that he had been elected pope. *Vera Katz: Mayor of Portland. Referenced only as \\"the Cat\\" when it was revealed that Arminger had her and the Portland chief of police, Charles Moose, hung outside of the Portland Central Library. *Charles Moose: Portland chief of police. Referenced as \\"the Moose\\" alongside Mayor Vera \\"the Cat\\" Katz at their hanging. *Harrison Ford: Though not mentioned by name, he resembles the proprietor of Ford's Kyentse Cowboy Bar & Grill, an establishment mentioned in The Scourge of God and (like Ford's real-life ranch) located in Wyoming. * Reiko's grandmother was either Princess Mako or Princess Kako of the Japanese Imperial family, granddaughters of Emperor Akihito through his second son Fumihito, who is mentioned by name in Reiko's vision of her pregnant great-grandmother. We're told that Reiko's grandmother was a \\"small child\\" at the time of the Change, but this does not help in deciding between the princesses; in early 1998, Mako was 6 and Kako 3. The future empress was evacuated from Tokyo by a group of soldiers referred to as the Seventy Loyal Men, only 46 of whom survived the trip to Sado-ga-shima. * Kim Jong-il: Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il, under the influence of the same Powers who guided the Church Universal and Triumphant in the United States, conquered much of Asia after the Change, Japan being one of the few holdouts. He was succeeded by his son, but it has yet to be revealed if his heir is his real-world successor, Kim Jong-un.

Between 1952 and 1975 she worked at the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom (NUS) and during this time was instrumental in the creation of a universal system of grants for higher education students in Britain.Obituary: Stella Greenall  Education  The Guardian Early life Born in Sheffield, and a pupil at High Storrs Grammar School for Girls, she attended St Hugh's College, Oxford. Work with NUS Greenall was first involved with NUS as a student in the 1940s. She was then employed as a member of staff in 1952, and in her tenure there developed the union's education and welfare campaigns, especially around student finance. She was known as a formidable negotiator, and this culminated in the introduction, in 1962, of mandatory grants for all higher education students in the UK, a system which was in large part unchanged until the introduction of tuition fees in 1998. Later life In 1975, Greenall was persuaded to leave NUS to work as an advisor to the then Labour Education Secretary, Fred Mulley. She also advised his successor, Shirley Williams, until the Conservative victory in the 1979 elections. She was a staunch member of the Fabian Society. In 1998 she cancelled her standing order to the Labour Party as a result of their introduction of tuition fees. Numismatic Interests After his death in 1991, Greenall progressed her husband Philip's work on dividing 17th century tokens between London and Middlesex to publication in the British Numismatic Journal #61 from 1991. She also publicised with it a map in the London Topographical Society Newsletter of November 1993. Greenall presented their collection of 870 Venetian coins and 23 medals to the British Museum, a gift which was celebrated with the exhibition 'Venice Preserv'd' which ran from 9 November 1993 to 13 February 1994.

Childhood and studies  He was born in Asuncion on November 12, 1850. He was the son of the Colonel Juan Vicente Godoy and Petrona Echag√ºe. Narciso Echag√ºe y And√≠a, his mother‚Äôs father, was one of the leaders of the national independence. He was imprisoned during Francia‚Äôs dictatorship, and shot after twenty years in jail. Juan Silvano studied in the Jesuit College of the Inmaculate Conception in the city of Santa Fe, Argentina. There, he was condisciple of Jos√© Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n. In the holydays of 1864, he spent some time in Asunci√≥n. Due to his short age and good luck, Francisco Solano L√≥pez authorized him to continue his education in Argentina. This way, he escaped along with two of his brothers, the foulness of a war in which sixteen of the Echag√ºe family died. Some of the deceased were meritorious soldiers. He entered the Buenos Aires School of Law, and stayed there during the whole war. In January 1869, once Asuncion was occupied, he interrupted his studies to move back to their land with a group of young fellow patriots. This was done as an attempt to help reconstruct the nation. In spite of his religious formation, Godoi had become a mason and a freethinker.  The post-war  As a youngster Juan Silvano had begun replacing the ‚Äúy‚Äù in his original surname (Godoy) for an ‚ÄúI‚Äù. He was lucky enough to live through the dark postwar years in Paraguay. His strong and idealist personality forced him to get involved in the corrupt national politics. He did everything he could to help reconstruct a shattered country, but the politics scene was full of power disputes. Shortly he was known as one of the main politicians in the scene. Many politicians were killed or exiled in their attempt to establish a national order. During the time he spent in Paraguay after his return he knew many young national leaders. He was a co-founder of the Great Club of the People along with Jos√© Segundo Decoud, Facundo Macha√≠n, Juan Jos√© Decoud, Cayo Miltos and Miguel Palacios. He witnessed how many of his previously mentioned fellows vanished. He was elected as a conventional in the district of the Cathedral. He was a member of the commission that was in charge of redacting the Constitution of 1870. Once the triumvirate was dissolved because two of his members renounced, Cirilo Antonio Rivarola became the only ruler. In that chaotic environment, an ambitious and conservative character emerged, Juan Bautista Gill. After the killing of his brother Marcos, Juan Silvano declared himself an opponent of J. B. Gill. Since then, he became a part of a conspiracy to murder of Gill. The assassination occurred in the middle of the street, April 12, 1877.  Exile and return  After the murder, Godoi lived long exile of eighteen years in Buenos Aires. His enormous cultural background and well-known education, led him to meet most of the intellectuals of Argentina, like Arist√≥bulo Del Valle, Ram√≥n C√°rcano, Guido Spano, Mariano Pelliza and others. During the government of Colonel Escurra, in 1895, he returned to Paraguay. He took his library of twenty thousand volumes along with him. He also took many of his famous paintings. In addition to this he offered the country two books of his own, as a display of patriotism in spite of his long absence. In 1901, he became general director of the National Library, Museum and Archives. He represented Paraguay in 1910, the century of Argentina‚Äôs independence, in the America‚Äôs Congress.  His books  He wrote many books, and was a polemic journalist. In the writings he left, there is a very valuable legacy like: * ‚ÄúMonograf√≠as hist√≥ricas‚Äù (1893) * ‚ÄúOperaciones de Guerra del general Jos√© Eduvigis D√≠az‚Äù (1897) * ‚ÄúEl concepto de patria‚Äù (1998) * ‚ÄúEl coronel Juan Antonio Escurra‚Äù (1903) * ‚ÄúLa muerte del Mariscal L√≥pez‚Äù (1905) * ‚ÄúEl Bar√≥n de R√≠o Branco‚Äù (1913) * ‚ÄúEl asalto a los acorazados‚Äù (1919) Godoi died in January 1926, in Asunci√≥n.

This contrasts with the total return, which does take into account the income generated in the portfolio. Often, when the return of a stock market index is quoted in the press, the quoted returns concern price returns, rather than the total returns. Examples are the S&P; 500 and the MSCI EAFE, which are typically quoted in terms of price return. This is clearly misleading, since, economically speaking, it is the total return that is the only thing that matters. Whether that return is generated in the form of cash income or in capital appreciation is irrelevant as long as one can always liquidate the investment to realise the capital appreciation into cash. For the same reason, it is inappropriate to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager by comparing the total return on the portfolio to the price return of an index. After all, the total return on the index will always exceed the price return on the same index, so the portfolio manager could simply outperform the price return of the index by investing in the index.

After having performed his first experiments in the field of astrophysics (in Jodrell Bank Observatory and Nan√ßay Decimetric Radio Telescope) and solid- state physics (in Grenoble University), his observations in social sciences led him to write his first book (1976) on the relationships between science and the military.La science et le militaire, √âditions du Seuil, Paris, 1976 In a subsequent shift in intellectual pursuits toward the social sciences, his research focused on the sociology of the labour knowledge and of the division of labour,Les savoirs ouvriers, With Yves Lescot et Patrick Pharo, √âditions ACT, 1980, Paris on the sociology of the family, with the creation of a new typology of family organisation\\"Les mutations de la famille et les modes de reproduction de la force de travail\\", L'homme et la soci√©t√©, 1979, n¬∞ 51, Paris and an analysis of The Economic Rationales Within the Family, a topic which became the title of his PhD in Economics.Paris X University, 1982 In the 1990s, as a sociologist searching for root causes of family behaviours, he discovered significant correlation between risky behaviours, vulnerability to illness and grave childhood traumatic events, findings that he explored in greater depth, first with data from INSEE,\\"Incidents de paiement et trajectoires personnelles des d√©biteurs\\", Revue d'√©conomie financi√®re, n¬∞ 4, 1990, Paris and \\"Troubles de sant√© √† l'√¢ge adulte et difficult√©s familiales durant l'enfance\\", Population, 4, 1992, INED, Paris then with IRDES data.Probl√®mes de l'enfance, statut social et sant√© des adultes, IRDES, 1994, Paris As an economist, he tried also to explain these findings with concepts from health economics and risk economics.\\"Recours aux soins des adultes et mode de gestion du risque\\", √âconomie et Pr√©vision, N¬∞129-130 (3-4), 1997, Paris Since 2003 he has focused on measuring social well-being by building economic security indices.¬´ The decommodified security ratio: A tool for assessing European social protection systems ¬ªInternational Social Security Review , Volume 60, Issue 4, page 69-103, Gen√®ve, October‚ÄìDecember 2007 Activities Since 1999, Menahem has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Council of ATTAC. Recently he published an analysis of the European process of militarization through its relationships with European foreign policy.cf. \\"A militarized European Union\\" in Europe in the world, book edited by Trevor Evans In August 2008 and in August 2011, Menahem directed workshops on the European militarization: first, in the Attac European Summer University of Saarbr√ºcken.See European Summer University \\"The workshop proposes some materials in order to analyse the present European defence policy. The analysis of the implications of the Treaty of Lisbon for the militarization of the European Union is done with reference to the story of Europe's militarization and to an analysis of the European Union's aim: to play a larger role on the international stage\\". and second in the Attac European Network Academy in Fribourg.Voir ¬´ Europe Militarization ¬ª . Since 2008, Menahem has also participated in the \\"Forum for Alternative Indicators of Riches\\" (FAIR more known according its French acronymSee some French and English papers of this NGO on its web-site.) which was founded in order to monitor the activities of the \\"Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\\" chaired by Joseph Stiglitz. Following this path, he has contributed to elaborate the critical analysis of the final report of this commission.Cf. See the French and English summary of this report on the FAIR web-site. In 2011, he published on the web-site of the UNCSD \\"Rio + 20 Conf√©rence\\" a paperSee INDICATORS FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE WORLD, text signed by two French and Italian associations, FAIR and Sbilanciamoci!. arguing to enlarge well-being indicators that the United Nations general secretary will have to implement after the Rio+20 Conference. In June 2012, he participated in the Rio+20 Summit, holding a side-event and two self-organized activities in the World People Summit with two other members of FAIR, the Belgium professor Isabelle Cassiers and the French-Indian accountant Muttiah Yogananthan. Their critics were mainly devoted to criticize on environmental grounds the monetization of the sustainability approach by the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). According to Georges Menahem, \\"the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), a measure introduced by the UNEP and the UN University, would make the world's environmental situation worse: if it is adopted and widely used, it could be very dangerous. It underestimates the depletion of natural resources and overestimates the monetized outcome of GDP, such as GDP and human capital\\".The Guardian, in its article of the 21 June 2012 Since the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, following the Evo Morales speech proposing the creation of a Global Climate Tribunal, Georges Menahem has been working on the establishment of a court that would expand the environmental expertise of the International Criminal Court. To develop the legal means of defending the environment, he has joined in May 2013 the European team that has attempted since 2012 to promote a European Citizen Initiative to prosecute acts generating ecocide.Cf. the \\"about us / team\\" on [End https://www.endecocide.org/fr/about-us/#9 Ecocide on Earth]. In 2016, Georges Menahem has made conferences in the area of environmental justice, including Ukraine about considerable pollution of the Dnieper, actually in two presentations he made at the National University of Zaporozhye.See the Ukrainian University web-site -yuridichnogo-fakultetiv- lektsiyu-pro-ekologichni-pravoporushennya account of its conference held on May 11, with the collaboration of Law and Biological Departments, especially with the Biology Faculty Dean Lyudmila Omelianchik, the International vice- dean Natalia Rubtsov and the vice-dean of the Faculty of Law Paul Lyutikov.

Biography He was born on June 6, 1800 in New York City to Stephen Stilwell, who had fought in the American Revolutionary War and opened a glass factory in 1804 in Woodstock, New York. Silas was educated at Woodstock Free Academy until 1812, then, after his father's bankruptcy, he went to New York City and began to work. In 1814, he engaged in surveying in the west, and then settled in Tennessee. In 1822, he was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Afterwards he removed to Virginia, and was Clerk of Tazewell County and a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He was admitted to the bar in 1824. He returned to New York in 1828, and was a member from New York County of the New York State Assembly from 1830 to 1833. In 1830, he proposed \\"An act to abolish imprisonment for debt and to punish fraudulent debtors\\" in the Assembly, which was enacted on April 26, 1831, and became known as the Stilwell Act. In 1834, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the Whig ticket with William H. Seward, but they were defeated. He was an alderman in New York City in 1835, and chosen chairman of the Board of Aldermen. In this year, the political parties were equally divided, and as he had the casting vote on all appointments he became popularly known as \\"King Caucus\\". He was acting mayor at the time of the Great Fire of New York in 1835. He was married Caroline Norseworthy (1820-?) around 1840, and one of their children was Silas Moore Stilwell, Jr. (1854‚Äì1891), a lawyer in New York City. He was United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York during President John Tyler's administration from 1841 to 1845. At this time he was sent on a special mission to The Hague to negotiate a loan for the U.S. government. At the end of his term he resumed the practice of law.

The original copy of the mandala is still housed in the Taima-dera temple in Nara, Japan, and was woven c. 763. The mandala is appointed as a national treasure of Japan on April 27, 1961. Many copies have been made since, and the original work has degraded considerably. According to popular legend, Ch≈´j≈ç-hime witnessed the creation of the mandala, crafted from fibers of lotus stems by two nuns who were thought to be Amida Buddha (Buddha of Infinite Light) and Kannon Bodhisattva. The imagery of the Mandala is based mostly on the Sutra of the Contemplation of Amitayus Ë¶≥ÁÑ°ÈáèÂØøÁµå, and has been the subject of several doctrinal commentaries in Japanese Buddhism. Description The central image is the Pure Land itself, while the left, right, and lower borders are lined with images from the Contemplation Sutra. The central image, called the Court of Essential Doctrine, depicts the Amida Buddha surrounded by his worshippers that have reached enlightenment, buildings, and the land that exists in his Paradise. At the top of the central image there are many figures floating in the sky on clouds. Each of these figures have the distinctive characteristic of a halo behind their heads. This detail is a signifier that each of them have achieved enlightenment. Alongside of them are various birds flying about, scarves floating in the air, and some lotus flowers. All the figures, scarves, and birds all float towards the center of the image. Below the floating figures, in the center, near the top of the image, there are images of buildings that appear to look like temples or palaces floating in the sky, as well. These floating buildings lead down to what appears to be an indoor garden surrounded by more buildings, this time located to the ground. These buildings are designed after eighth-century Chinese Palaces. Each of these buildings, as well as the trees in the garden, are made of the seven precious substances‚Äìgold, silver, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, coral, agate, and mother- of-pearl. Throughout the palaces are more enlightened figures meditating. Most Chinese palaces are raised on a platform as their foundation. The structural beams are primarily used to support the roof of the building. They are connected to directly to each other due to the brackets. The walls are either curtained or door panels to define the rooms or to enclose the building. In the Taima, the buildings display a sweeping roof. This type of roof holds a sweeping curve that raises the corners of the roofs. In the very center of this image is what appears to be a dock in the middle of a lotus pond. On this dock, there are three figures seated on lotus thrones surrounded by many meditating enlightened figures. All three of these figures are bigger than the rest throughout the image, but the centered one is the largest of them all. The centered figure is known as Amida, the deity of the Western Paradise. The figure to each of his sides are known as bodhisattvas, people who have reached enlightenment, but stayed on earth to teach the ways of the Buddha to help others reach their enlightenment. These two figures are the bodhisattva Kannon and bodhisattva Seishi. Surrounding the middle dock holding Amida are several smaller docks, all connected to the centered dock, each holding more meditating figures. In the pond itself are boats and lotus flowers. Upon close examination, one can see many figures being born from the lotus flowers. These are people who have reached enlightenment and are being welcomed into the Western Paradise. The boats are there to bring the enlightened figures to land so they can continue their worship. The left border (the Court of Prefatory Legend) shows, first, the discovery of the Sutra on Vulture Peak at the top, and then illustrates the introduction of the Sutra, from the bottom upward: Prince Ajasatru's temptation, the imprisonment of his father and then his mother, and Queen Vaidehi's prayers answered by Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni transmits the knowledge of the Pure Land to his disciple in the last panel, second from the top. Queen Vaidehi was given the task to meditate and visualize the elements that represented of the western paradise, illustrated in the right border. This is called Thirteen Meditational Contemplations (The Jozengzi). The elements are as shown: 1\\\\. The Sun 2\\\\. The Moon 3\\\\. The Lapis Lazuli (Jeweled Realm of the Western Paradise) 4\\\\. The Trees of Paradise 5\\\\. The Lakes of Paradise 6\\\\. The Multi-storied Jeweled Towers of Paradise 7\\\\. Amida's Jeweled Lotus Throne 8\\\\. The Amida Triad 9\\\\. The Great Body of Amida 10\\\\. Amida in Half-lotus Position 11\\\\. The Bodhisattva Shishi 12\\\\. Imagining oneself reborn in Paradise 13\\\\. The Small Body of Amida The bottom border illustrate the nine levels of birth. This is described as the Court of General Meditations (Sanzengi). This is an extension of the Thirteen Meditational Concentrations. The General Meditations are three levels of rebirth that are subdivided into three degrees (six births total). These births include from middle birth to upper degree to the upper birth of the lower degree (higher ranks closer to center of pond), and middle birth to lower degree and the lower birth of the lower degree (enclosed in the calyxes of lotus flowers further away from Amida). Surrounding the borders to the ends of the hanging scroll are designs of lotus flowers. Each lotus is painted with small and careful details to help make the images stand out.

From Santa Maria in Via Lata, Fortunatus‚Äô relics were translated to Casei Gerola in 1765, as a gift to the church there from the Holy See. Casei Gerola, in the province of Pavia, was an important village of the diocese of Tortona, which had close ties to the papacy. His relics were kept in an urn; Fortunatus‚Äô skull was crushed, indicating the cause of death to be a fatal blow to the head. Another source states that he was venerated in the catacombs of Saint Priscilla in Rome until 1600, when some of his relics were translated to Turbigo, although his relics were also claimed by Casei from 1700 onwards.La Legione Tebea There may have been two saints with the same name of Fortunatus. Some of his relics are also claimed by the parish of Lonate Pozzolo. He was proclaimed patron saint of Pantelleria after he is believed to have aided the island through miraculous intervention during an earthquake in 1831 and a seaquake in 1891.San Fortunato Pantelleria A procession in honor of the saint is held on October 16; a statue of the saint is carried on a boat.

In doing so it reduces wear and tear and overheating of the driving wheel tyres and brake blocks and enables a continuously high brake force to be applied. The brake works by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat. Steam is emitted during braking but this does not come from the boiler, it is produced by evaporation of water used to cool the cylinders. The main part of the system is piping and regulation of atmospheric air drawn into the cylinders, into which cooling water and oil is injected. Operation To use the cylinders as pumps necessitates complete reversal of the normal gas flow. Atmospheric air is drawn through the steam exhaust and compressed air ejected through the steam inlet. A separate chimney is provided, usually behind the main chimney, to exhaust the compressed air without increasing flow through the smokebox (which would cause increased draught of the fire). Water injected into the incoming air evaporates during compression, carrying away much of the heat generated. Oil is also injected into the incoming air to maintain lubrication of the cylinders. Use =Austria and Germany= Counter-pressure brakes were found especially on steam engines that worked long inclines and on rack railway locomotives (e.g. on the Vienna Kahlenberg Railway (Kahlenbergbahn), relieving brake blocks and tyres from high levels of wear and tear that they would otherwise be subjected to., p. 251. For operation on ramps its availability was indispensable because these dynamic brakes on steam locomotives provided the required third independent set of brakes.

The center pulley is the crankshaft, the lower left one the seawater pump, the upper right one the alternator. The Yanmar 2GM20 is a series of inboard marine diesel engine manufactured by the Japanese company Yanmar Co. Ltd.. It is used in a wide range of sailboats and motorboats. The 2GM20 is out of production and has been superseded by the newer Yanmar 2YM20 series. Specifications It is a four-stroke, vertical, water-cooled diesel engine. It is built around two cylinders (hence the \\"2\\" in 2GM20) of 75 mm in diameter and 72 mm in stroke, adding up to 0.635 litres in displacement: each cylinder is roughly the size and volume of a 300 ml soft-drink can. The compression system uses a proprietary swirl-type pre-combustion chamber.Yanmar technical reference sheet The continuous rating output at the crankshaft is 11.8 kW, at 3400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The maximum output at the crankshaft is 13.4 kW, at 3600 rpm. The engine delivers roughly 16 horsepower, for a weight of about 114 kg. The engine is equipped with a starting motor (D.C. 12V, 1 kW), and an alternator to provide electricity and charge onboard batteries (12V, 55A). The engine is typically activated by a key and a starting motor switch. Upon turning the key and pressing the starting motor switch, the oil pressure alarm will ring for about a second until the engine starts to run. The exit of cooling water from the exhaust into the sea (typically at the aft of the boat) should be checked at that time. After a few minutes, the hot cooling water alarm will sound if the cooling water does not get through the engine (as when the seawater cock has remained closed -most likely case- or if something is clogging the seawater tubing). =Water pump= Yanmar 2GM20 seawater pump. Cooling seawater enters from the tube on the left. The 2GM20 series uses either a direct seawater cooling system, or an indirect freshwater cooling system (specified by the suffix letter F i.e. 2GM20F). Seawater is pumped into the engine through a seawater pump (impeller type). In the engines equipped with a direct seawater cooling system, seawater is used to cool the internals of the engine directly. The engines equipped with a fresh water cooling system have an additional heat exchanger, where heat transfer occurs between the seawater and internal freshwater. The impeller of the seawater pump can suffer from wear and tear, especially when run dry for some period of time, in which case it has to be replaced to avoid loss in the flow of cooling seawater, a potential source of engine overheating. A particularly difficult problem in tropical waters is jellyfish. Their tentacles can be sucked into water intakes. In extremes, it is possible for the rubber exhaust hose to catch fire, the plastic silencer to melt and the head-gasket to fail. In colder waters, boats are far less likely to meet such problems. The solution is to have a large basket-type water strainer and overheat alarms (standard on most Yanmar engines) The seawater pump is rotated by a short belt linked to the crankshaft. =Fuel filter= Yanmar 2GM20 fuel filter. An inline fuel filter is easily accessible from the front part of the engine. The filter retains solid particles and separates water from diesel (as water is heavier than diesel, it will settle at the bottom of the filter), just before the diesel fuel enters the highly sensitive high-pressure fuel pump. The water inside diesel fuel can lead to rusting of the internals of the engine, as well as lubrication problems. The filter element is made of fluted paper with metal end caps. When the engine has to be bled because air has penetrated into the pipes (usually after running out of diesel), it will usually be necessary to bleed the diesel filter: the top vent is unscrewed so as to let the excess air escape, while diesel fuel is pumped into the fuel filter with the manual fuel lift pump (just behind the yellow dipstick). The vent can be screwed shut when diesel fuel starts to gush out of it. A primary fuel filter is usually installed upstream of the engine, so as to filter out the larger particles and filter a larger quantity of water that might be present in the fuel. Every time a filter is disassembled or changed, it will be necessary to bleed it so as to remove excess air, again by opening the top vent so as to let diesel chase all the air (diesel fills up the filter either through gravity -usually the case for the primary filter- or with the help of the fuel lift pump -usually the case for the engine fuel filter-) and diesel starts to gush out. The vent should then be screwed shut. New models The 2GM20 and 3GM30 (three-cylinder) series have now been superseded in the Yanmar catalog by the new lightweight and modernized engines, the 2YM15, 3YM20, and 3YM30. These new engines also feature simplified maintenance of the seawater pump and other services points, as they are now located on the front part of the engine.Yanmar website These new engines also meet new Tier II emission standards introduced in the EU and the US in 2006.Yanmar technical data for the 2YM15, 3YM20 and 3YM30 Parts Image:Yanmar Injectors.JPGYanmar 2GM20 injectors.

During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stroganov fled to Paris where he remained with his family until he died in 1923.

There is no indication Stroganov and Shcherbatov or their breeding stock had any involvement in the founding of the Soviet-run Tersk Stud.  Soviet-era Arabian horse program  Arabians were re-introduced to the new Tersk Stud in 1925 and the first French Arabian imports arrived in 1930. These included the stallion Kann and six mares, most notable of which was Carabine. Koheilan IV was imported from Hungary. The French horses had generally good conformation but were lacking Arabian type, so the stud‚Äôs managers searched for quality breeding stock with the characteristic Arabian refinement. In 1936, a shipment of 25 horses came from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, some of which were descended from horses that had lived at the Stroganov and Shcherbatov stud and perished during the revolution. There were six stallions in the purchase, of which Naseem (a son of Skowronek and great-grandson of Mesaoud) was the most influential. Among the mares, Rissalma, Rixalina, and Star of the Hills left a significant impression on the breed. Tersk attempted to purchase Skowronek himself from Crabbet Stud, but he was not for sale. World War II added significant bloodstock to Tersk, at the expense of Poland‚Äôs Arabian breeding program. In 1939 the Soviets removed many of the best Arabians bred at Jan√≥w Podlaski Stud in Poland and marched them over 1,000 miles back to Tersk Stud. Among the horses making the trek was Mammona, a bay suckling filly whose name meant ‚Äútreasure‚Äù in Polish. Mammona‚Äôs sire, Ofir, was also in the group of horses moved to Tersk. He had already left his mark on the breed by siring the famous \\"three Ws\\" in Poland: Witraz (the sire of *Bask), *Witez II, and Wielki Szlem. Ofir did not sire the same caliber of horses at Tersk as he did in Poland.\\"Russian Arabian Families\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1985 In 1941, to evade the advancing German troops, the Tersk horses were evacuated to western Kazakhstan where they faced harsh weather and terrain. However, they returned to Tersk in 1943 with few losses.Lipowicz, Zenon, \\"L' influence du pur sang arabe polonais sur l'√©levage en Russie\\", Le Cheval Arabe Mammona, the treasure of Tersk The Ofir daughter, Mammona, had an extensive influence upon the Tersk breeding program.

Aside from Ofir, other notable stallions brought to Tersk from Poland included Piolun, the sire of Priboj (out of Rissalma, who had been purchased from Crabbet Arabian Stud); and Taki Pan, the sire of the mare Taktika, who produced the mare Ptashka and the stallions *Pietuszok and Topol (all by Priboj).

Negativ sired 12 foal crops in Russia, but because they did not excel on the racetrack he was sold to Poland in 1962, renamed ‚ÄúNegatiw,‚Äù and sired better racehorses out of the Polish mares.Arieana Arabians, \\"Negatiw\\", CMK Heritage Notebook Negativ‚Äôs best-siring sons at Tersk were Suvenir and *Salon,Balakshin, Dr. O.A., \\"Arabian Breeding in the USSR\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1981 the latter the sire of both the U.S. and Canadian National Champion Stallion *Muscat and Tersk head sire *Moment. Another Negativ son, Nabor (later renamed *Naborr when he was imported to the U.S.), sired just 9 registered foals at Tersk,[1999 Arabian Horse Bookshelf, Arabian Horse Registry of America CD-ROM] apparently because his offspring were considered too delicate for the Tersk program, and was exported to Poland in 1955. The Poles sought a stallion of the Ibrahim sire line, and had hoped to purchase Negativ from Tersk but were unable at the time, but were satisfied to own his son Nabor instead. Nabor was exported to the U.S. in 1963, becoming the first Tersk-bred Arabian to go to the States. *Naborr was owned in the United States by Anne McCormack, and then upon her death was purchased at auction by Tom Chauncey and entertainer Wayne Newton. None of Negativ‚Äôs Tersk- bred daughters had a significant influence on the Tersk program. After World War II, Tersk imported a few stallions from Poland: Arax in 1958, Semen in 1962, and Elfur (a full brother to *El Paso) in 1972. Of these stallions, Arax had the greatest impact on Tersk‚Äôs program, siring the influential stallion Nabeg and a number of quality daughters.

Nil sired only 16 foals before his untimely death in 1960, but still left a lasting impression on the Tersk program. His loss was unfortunate because, based on his structure and brief siring record, Nil could have been as significant to Tersk as his successor. In 1963, the Egyptian government gave another stallion to the Soviet Union, Raafat by Nazeer, who was renamed Aswan by the Soviets in honor of the dam project. Aswan as a young stallion in Egypt Aswan had a profound influence on the Tersk breeding program. As a whole, the broodmare band at Tersk had generally good structure but lacked some elements of Arabian type. Aswan introduced a more extreme dished head with large nostrils, large expressive eye, long level croup, and high tail carriage. He also had obvious faults, such as offset front knees, post-legged back legs, a long low back, a \\"wasp- waist,\\" and a thick neck and throatlatch. But because Aswan‚Äôs faults were different than the Tersk mares‚Äô faults, they often complemented each other well.Multiple commenters, \\"The Aswan/*Salon Legacy\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1984 Aswan sired 299 offspring over 20 seasons at Tersk, more than any other stallion in the stud‚Äôs history.Sunshine Ridge Arabians, \\"Aswan\\" Some of Aswan‚Äôs best-known sons included Palas (out of a daughter of Nil, the first stallion given to the USSR by Egypt), who was exported to Poland and became a head sire at Janow Podlaski for many years; Kilimanjaro, a German National Reserve Champion who sired champions in North America and Europe; Patron, who sired the U.S. and Canadian National Champion Stallion *Padron before his untimely death; and Plakat, a European champion who sired many champions himself. Aswan excelled at siring broodmares. Examples include Pesnia, the dam of *Pesniar, who was purchased for $1 million and imported to the U.S. in 1981;\\"A Stable Island of Amity\\", Time, July 11, 1983 Molva, called Aswan‚Äôs most beautiful and best-producing daughter by former Tersk director Alexander PonomarevWhittlesey, Dee, \\"Tersk: An Overview\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1984 and the dam of Wympel; and Karinka, a full sister to Kilimanjaro, an accomplished race mare and the dam of Russian Derby winner and European Champion Stallion Drug. The *Menes son Balaton, out of the Aswan daughter Panagia, was foaled in 1982 at Tersk and was immediately identified as the stud‚Äôs next great hope. Balaton became one of the youngest stallions to become a head sire at Tersk at just three years of age, and Tersk Director Alexander Ponomarev called him \\"the horse of the century at Tersk\\"Finke, Betty, \\"The Tersk Stud Breeding Program\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1986 after his first foal crop arrived. The Balaton son Kubinec, out of the *Muscat daughter Kosmetika, was foaled at Tersk in 1987. A chestnut with a wide blaze going all the way over his nose and lips, Kubinec‚Äôs white markings weren't considered acceptable in the Tersk breeding program. According to Dr. O.A. Balakshin of the All Russian Research Institute of Horse Breeding, ‚ÄúToo many horses now have white markings on their head and legs. This is undesirable and should be eliminated by selection.‚Äù. Kubinec was sold in 1991 and began making his mark in European show rings. He was named German National, European, and World Champion Stallion as well as European Conference of Arab Horse Organizations (ECAHO) \\"Five Star Stallion\\" and his offspring are desirable around the world today. In the mid-1980s, Tersk Stud introduced a few different outcross stallions, such as the Polish imports Gvizd (\\"Gwizd\\" in Poland) and Harfiaj (\\"Harfiarz\\" in Poland) and the English-bred pure Spanish Esplendor. Gvizd, Harfiaj, and Esplendor left Tersk but some of their descendants were used in the Tersk breeding program. Of the three outcross stallions, Gvizd had the greatest influence through a few of his daughters and his son, Negasimyi, who later became a sire of racehorses at Tersk in the mid-1990s. Gvizd's daughter Purga produced the stallion Padishah (by race winner Drug), who won several halter championships in Europe in the early 2000s. Gvizd also sired Pogojii, winner of four stakes races in Russia.  Post-1991 stud history  The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought Tersk's future into question. =Influence of American buyers = By the mid-1980s, Russian Arabians were viewed as an exotic and profitable business in the U.S. Notable examples include Pesniar, who was purchased from Tersk in 1981 for $1 million, and Peleng, who was purchased for well in excess of $3 million in 1985. Before American-purchased Tersk Arabians were eligible for registration in the U.S., Howard F. Kale traded two Standardbred stallions worth $1 million each to Tersk Stud for the stallion *Muscat.\\"Sire of Significance: *Muscat\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1985 Russian horses also retained their value within the U.S. A half-interest in the aged broodmare *Nariadnaia was sold at auction in the U.S. for $580,000 in 1983 and the stallion *Abdullahhh was sold for $3.2 million at a U.S. auction in 1984.\\"Top Twenty Sellers in America: Pure Russian and Russian Cross\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1984 The Soviets noticed the inflated prices that westerners were willing to pay for their horses and accordingly set high reserves on their auction lots. Prices began to come down at the annual Tersk auction starting in 1985 and the values of all big- investment Arabian horses dropped dramatically after the U.S. tax laws were changed in 1986. After that point, breeding \\"straight Russian\\" Arabians, or horses that were descended only from Tersk-bred horses, was not as common in the U.S. Some American breeders increasingly crossed Russian-bred horses with other lines to produce more exotic type and movement, while Arabian sport horse breeders outcrossed to Russian lines for their athletic ability. = Acceptance by the American Arabian registry = The Arabian Horse Registry of America (AHRA) did not approve the Russian Stud Book until 1978, meaning any Arabians imported to the U.S. directly from Tersk Stud were not permitted to be registered. The reason given by the Registry in a letter to Mr. Ed Tweed was ‚Äúwe mustn‚Äôt deal with the Russians‚Äù after Tweed attempted to register the Tersk-bred mares *Napaika and *Palmira and the stallion *Park in 1963. Tweed argued that the Tersk-bred *Naborr was registered by AHRA that same year with no problems, to which the registry replied that a Russian-bred horse may be registered by AHRA as long as the horse was owned in England or Poland for several years before its sale to the U.S. (*Naborr was sold by Tersk to Poland and used there for a number of years before he was imported to the U.S.) ‚ÄúWe (Americans) are not as intimately acquainted with the Russians as the Poles and British, and we need not deal with them.‚ÄùHearst, Denise, \\"Early Russian Imports\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1984 AHRA eventually accepted and approved the registering of Arabians imported directly from the Soviet Union in 1978, and *Napaika and *Palmira were registered that same year.  Tersk environment  Tersk Stud is located in the Caucasus Mountains in southern European Russia. The nearby town, Mineralnye Vody, means \\"mineral waters\\" and is renowned as a spa town. The weather is mild, ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.Our Pyatigorsk Online While the weather is not harsh, the mares and foals at Tersk Stud live a rugged life outdoors most of the time. There are no fences around the stud, so mounted watchmen follow and monitor the herds night and day. The horses are brought into the barn twice each day to be fed and checked, but otherwise they are free to enjoy the open spaces.Boiselle, Gabrielle, \\"Rainy Days at Tersk\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1985  Breeding operations  Tersk is best known for its purebred Arabian horses, but it has also hosted breeding programs for Akhal-Tekes, Terskys, Kabardins, and Dons. All Terskys were transferred to nearby Stavropol Stud in 1945 to continue the development of the new breed.\\"Tersk, A Partbred Arabian Horse\\", Troika, Your gateway to Russian horses From the beginning of its history, the stud has tested its horses on the racetrack. Tersk Arabians are sent to the Pyatigorsk racetrack at the age of two and may race one or two seasons. The best performers race on Sundays, with two-year-olds running 1,400 meters and older horses running 1,600 and 1,800 meters. The top individuals may be used for breeding at Tersk or return to the racetrack for another season. Many others will be sold at the age of three. While race records are important to the Tersk breeding program, Dr. Balakshin stated ‚Äú‚Ä¶good racing results are not the only criterion for selecting young stock for breeding purposes. Excellent runners which deviate from breed type may be used for limited breeding or else they are eliminated from selection.‚Äù Any horse used for breeding at Tersk is required to be rated ‚ÄúElite‚Äù or ‚ÄúGrade I‚Äù in the Russian Stud Book. Horses that receive lower grades are sent to other studs or sold.Edwards, Gladys Brown, \\"Ask Gladys: Getting the Most out of the Russian Stud Books\\", Arabian Horse World, November 1985 The current stud director is Vladimir Tolmachyov.

M. Murdock, was an American writer supporting the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed as a historical person, but was rather a mingling of various pre-Christian myths, Sun deities and dying- and-rising deities. She wrote and operated a website focused on history, religion and spirituality, and astro-theology. She asserted the pre-Christian religious civilizations understood their myths as allegorical, but Christians obliterated evidence by destroying suppressing literature after they attained control of the Roman Empire, leading to widespread illiteracy in the ancient world, ensuring the mythical nature of Christ's story was hidden. She argued the Christian canon, as well as its important figures, were based on Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and other cultures' myths. Her theories are variously received by mainstream scholars; for instance, Robert M. Price criticized her first book while praising later writing. She also wrote against the ancient astronauts theories, asserting they \\"may be prompted by the same type of motivation that produced the Bible, a chronicle largely-consisting of the plagiarized myths of other cultures\\" re-fashioned as 'fact' concerning purported legend-based characterizations, and may be driven by the attempt to validate biblical myth as historical under a different 'interpretation'. Life Murdock was born to James Milne Murdock and Beatrice Murdock in Massachusetts and grew up in Avon, Connecticut. She received a Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree in Classics, Greek Civilization, from Franklin and Marshall College, then spent a year at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece. She had one son. She died of cancers in her immune system and liver on December 25, 2015. She was known as \\"Dori\\" to her loved ones. Writing career Murdock began her website, Truth Be Known, in 1995. 1999, as Acharya S, she published her first book, The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold, arguing the Jesus Christ story is a fabrication.Adventure Unlimited Press, rear cover of Murdock (1999) Her 2007 book, Who Was Jesus? Fingerprints of The Christ continues the theme of The Christ Conspiracy by expanding her theory questioning the historicity of Jesus, alleging \\"early Christian history to be largely myth, by sorting through available historical and archaeological data.\\" In 2009, she released Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection and The Gospel According to Acharya S. Reception Writer Russ Kick, in his book You Are Being Lied To, describes The Christ Conspiracy as \\"an essential book for anyone who wants to know the reality behind the world's dominant religion\\". Conspiracy theorist and publisher Kenn Thomas calls her a \\"great chronicler of the conspiracy known as Christianity\\". Baptist comparative religion scholar Clinton Bennett compares her views to those of radical freethinker Robert Taylor (nicknamed \\"the Devil's chaplain\\"), secularist MP and Christ-mythicist John M. Robertson, and American mythographer Joseph Campbell. Butler University religion professor James F. McGrath describes her viewpoint as one that \\"once had some currency among scholars\\" in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but was subsequently abandoned. Atheist activist and Christ mythicist Richard Carrier criticized her use of the inscriptions at Luxor to make the claim that the story of Jesus' birth was inspired by the Luxor story of the birth of Horus. Theologian and Christ-mythicist Robert M. Price also criticized Murdock's first book, while promoting her Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled in The Pre-Nicene New Testament: Fifty-Four Formative Texts,p. 1179 and writing the foreword to her Who Was Jesus?: Fingerprints of the Christ. Her work has also been criticized by New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, who, in his Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth calls Murdock's The Christ Conspiracy \\"the breathless conspirator's dream\\". He says \\"all of Acharya's major points are in fact wrong\\" and her book \\"is filled with so many factual errors and outlandish assertions that it is hard to believe the author is serious\\". Taking her as representative of some other writers about the Christ myth theory, he continues \\"Mythicists of this ilk should not be surprised that their views are not taken seriously by real scholars, mentioned by experts in the field, or even read by them\\". Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the University of Nottingham Maurice Casey criticized her work for \\"her anti-Christian outlook, a lack of any proper sense of reality, failure to give adequate references, inability to interpret primary sources correctly, and dependence on inaccurate out-of-date secondary sources rather than primary evidence.\\" Publications   * * See also * Historicity of Jesus References  External links  * Category:1960 births Category:2015 deaths Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American School of Classical Studies at Athens Category:Bible conspiracy theories Category:Christ myth theory proponents Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:Franklin & Marshall College alumni Category:People from Avon, Connecticut Category:Pseudohistorians Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:Writers from Connecticut Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:American women historians Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Pseudonymous writers ","title":"Acharya S"},{"id":"18233533","text":"Taima-dera Taima-dera (Áï∂È∫ªÂØ∫) is a Buddhist temple in Katsuragi, Nara, Japan. The temple legend says it was built originally in 612 by the Imperial Prince Maroko, the brother of Prince Shotoku. The temple was moved to its present location in 681 by the grandson of Prince Maroko, and served as the head temple, or honzan (Êú¨Â±±) of the Hosso sect although currently the temple is jointly administrated by Shingon and Jodo schools. Taima Mandala(copy), Kamakura period, 14th century, Japan The temple's main object of veneration is Maitreya Bodhisattva, but the most popular attraction is the Taima Mandala, a graphical representation of the Sukhavati Pure Land, and pilgrimage site for Pure Land Buddhists. It is believed that the Taima Mandala was woven in one day by Princess Chujo-hime. Architecture Taima-dera's twin pagodas Taima- dera is the only temple in Japan to have its original twin pagodas intact, which date from around AD 710. The surrounding gardens are renowned for peonies in May and a large lotus pond which blooms in June. The temple consists of the three main halls, the Main Mandala Hall, Kondou and Koudou and various sub-temples, the main ones being, Okunoin, Seinanin, Nakanobo and Gonenin. They contain Buddhist statues, Buddhist paintings and craft products, many of which are national treasures and important cultural properties. =Main Mandala Hall= Mandala main hall with Kondou on the left and Koudou on the right The Mandala Hall also known as the Hondou is the main hall at Taima-dera and it houses the Taima-Mandala, an important national treasure. =Kondou= At the time of construction, the Kondou was designated as the main hall at Taima-dera before switching to the Main Mandala Hall. It houses a statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva which is Japan's oldest clay statue of the Buddha. =Koudou= The Koudou is situated opposite to the kondou and houses many beautiful Buddhist statues dating from the 9th to 12th century. =Okunoin Temple (Inner Temple)= Okunoin temple is situated at the west end of the temple. It contains the Jodo Garden (Garden of Pure Land) which is the largest garden representing the paradise shown in the Taima Mandala. There are peonies, colored leaves, and other flowers bloom throughout the year. =Sainanin Temple (South-West Temple)= Sainanin temple The South-west temple was originally built to be a guardian temple near the back gate. There are three statues of Kannon which worshipped in its main hall and in the back there is a beautiful garden made in the early Edo era. =Nakanobo Temple (Middle Temple)= It is the oldest temple in Taima-dera and has a beautiful garden with a tea ceremony house. =Gonenin Temple (Praying Temple)= Gonenin temple is said to have been the residence of Chujyo-hime. This temple houses the masks and costumes representing Boddhisatvas which are used in the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki event described below. =Events= The most famous event at Taima-dera is the Neri-Kuyo Eshiki which is a special memorial parade for Princess Chujo. It features a procession of twenty-five priests wearing masks and special costumes representing Boddhisatvas and who re-enact the world depicted by the Taima Mandala. They walk and dance across a long bridge, which is believed to link this world with the Pure Land, giving hope to commoners that they, too, one day may reach the Pure land.

Typical problem areas of interest include the traditional fields of structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, mass transport, and electromagnetic potential. The FEM is a particular numerical method for solving partial differential equations in two or three space variables (i.e., some boundary value problems). To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space discretization in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a mesh of the object: the numerical domain for the solution, which has a finite number of points. The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain. The simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem. The FEM then uses variational methods from the calculus of variations to approximate a solution by minimizing an associated error function. Studying or analyzing a phenomenon with FEM is often referred to as finite element analysis (FEA). Basic concepts The subdivision of a whole domain into simpler parts has several advantages: *Accurate representation of complex geometry *Inclusion of dissimilar material properties *Easy representation of the total solution *Capture of local effects. Typical work out of the method involves (1) dividing the domain of the problem into a collection of subdomains, with each subdomain represented by a set of element equations to the original problem, followed by (2) systematically recombining all sets of element equations into a global system of equations for the final calculation. The global system of equations has known solution techniques, and can be calculated from the initial values of the original problem to obtain a numerical answer. In the first step above, the element equations are simple equations that locally approximate the original complex equations to be studied, where the original equations are often partial differential equations (PDE). To explain the approximation in this process, the Finite element method is commonly introduced as a special case of Galerkin method. The process, in mathematical language, is to construct an integral of the inner product of the residual and the weight functions and set the integral to zero. In simple terms, it is a procedure that minimizes the error of approximation by fitting trial functions into the PDE. The residual is the error caused by the trial functions, and the weight functions are polynomial approximation functions that project the residual. The process eliminates all the spatial derivatives from the PDE, thus approximating the PDE locally with *a set of algebraic equations for steady state problems, *a set of ordinary differential equations for transient problems. These equation sets are the element equations. They are linear if the underlying PDE is linear, and vice versa. Algebraic equation sets that arise in the steady-state problems are solved using numerical linear algebra methods, while ordinary differential equation sets that arise in the transient problems are solved by numerical integration using standard techniques such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method. In step (2) above, a global system of equations is generated from the element equations through a transformation of coordinates from the subdomains' local nodes to the domain's global nodes. This spatial transformation includes appropriate orientation adjustments as applied in relation to the reference coordinate system. The process is often carried out by FEM software using coordinate data generated from the subdomains. FEM is best understood from its practical application, known as finite element analysis (FEA). FEA as applied in engineering is a computational tool for performing engineering analysis. It includes the use of mesh generation techniques for dividing a complex problem into small elements, as well as the use of software program coded with FEM algorithm. In applying FEA, the complex problem is usually a physical system with the underlying physics such as the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, the heat equation, or the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in either PDE or integral equations, while the divided small elements of the complex problem represent different areas in the physical system. FEA is a good choice for analyzing problems over complicated domains (like cars and oil pipelines), when the domain changes (as during a solid-state reaction with a moving boundary), when the desired precision varies over the entire domain, or when the solution lacks smoothness. FEA simulations provide a valuable resource as they remove multiple instances of creation and testing of hard prototypes for various high fidelity situations. For instance, in a frontal crash simulation it is possible to increase prediction accuracy in \\"important\\" areas like the front of the car and reduce it in its rear (thus reducing the cost of the simulation). Another example would be in numerical weather prediction, where it is more important to have accurate predictions over developing highly nonlinear phenomena (such as tropical cyclones in the atmosphere, or eddies in the ocean) rather than relatively calm areas. History While it is difficult to quote a date of the invention of the finite element method, the method originated from the need to solve complex elasticity and structural analysis problems in civil and aeronautical engineering. Its development can be traced back to the work by A. Hrennikoff and R. Courant in the early 1940s. Another pioneer was Ioannis Argyris. In the USSR, the introduction of the practical application of the method is usually connected with name of Leonard Oganesyan. In China, in the later 1950s and early 1960s, based on the computations of dam constructions, K. Feng proposed a systematic numerical method for solving partial differential equations. The method was called the finite difference method based on variation principle, which was another independent invention of the finite element method. Although the approaches used by these pioneers are different, they share one essential characteristic: mesh discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains, usually called elements. Hrennikoff's work discretizes the domain by using a lattice analogy, while Courant's approach divides the domain into finite triangular subregions to solve second order elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise from the problem of torsion of a cylinder. Courant's contribution was evolutionary, drawing on a large body of earlier results for PDEs developed by Rayleigh, Ritz, and Galerkin. The finite element method obtained its real impetus in the 1960s and 1970s by the developments of J. H. Argyris with co-workers at the University of Stuttgart, R. W. Clough with co-workers at UC Berkeley, O. C. Zienkiewicz with co-workers Ernest Hinton, Bruce Irons and others at Swansea University, Philippe G. Ciarlet at the University of Paris 6 and Richard Gallagher with co-workers at Cornell University. Further impetus was provided in these years by available open source finite element software programs. NASA sponsored the original version of NASTRAN, and UC Berkeley made the finite element program SAP IV widely available. In Norway the ship classification society Det Norske Veritas (now DNV GL) developed Sesam in 1969 for use in analysis of ships. A rigorous mathematical basis to the finite element method was provided in 1973 with the publication by Strang and Fix. The method has since been generalized for the numerical modeling of physical systems in a wide variety of engineering disciplines, e.g., electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. Technical discussion =The structure of finite element methods= A finite element method is characterized by a variational formulation, a discretization strategy, one or more solution algorithms, and post-processing procedures. Examples of the variational formulation are the Galerkin method, the discontinuous Galerkin method, mixed methods, etc. A discretization strategy is understood to mean a clearly defined set of procedures that cover (a) the creation of finite element meshes, (b) the definition of basis function on reference elements (also called shape functions) and (c) the mapping of reference elements onto the elements of the mesh. Examples of discretization strategies are the h-version, p-version, hp-version, x-FEM, isogeometric analysis, etc. Each discretization strategy has certain advantages and disadvantages. A reasonable criterion in selecting a discretization strategy is to realize nearly optimal performance for the broadest set of mathematical models in a particular model class. Various numerical solution algorithms can be classified into two broad categories; direct and iterative solvers. These algorithms are designed to exploit the sparsity of matrices that depend on the choices of variational formulation and discretization strategy. Postprocessing procedures are designed for the extraction of the data of interest from a finite element solution. In order to meet the requirements of solution verification, postprocessors need to provide for a posteriori error estimation in terms of the quantities of interest. When the errors of approximation are larger than what is considered acceptable then the discretization has to be changed either by an automated adaptive process or by the action of the analyst. There are some very efficient postprocessors that provide for the realization of superconvergence. =Illustrative problems P1 and P2= We will demonstrate the finite element method using two sample problems from which the general method can be extrapolated. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with calculus and linear algebra. P1 is a one- dimensional problem :\\\\mbox{ P1 }:\\\\begin{cases} u(x)=f(x) \\\\mbox{ in } (0,1), \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(0)=u(1)=0, \\\\end{cases} where f is given, u is an unknown function of x, and u is the second derivative of u with respect to x. P2 is a two-dimensional problem (Dirichlet problem) :\\\\mbox{P2 }:\\\\begin{cases} u_{xx}(x,y)+u_{yy}(x,y)=f(x,y) & \\\\mbox{ in } \\\\Omega, \\\\\\\\\\\\ u=0 & \\\\mbox{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega, \\\\end{cases} where \\\\Omega is a connected open region in the (x,y) plane whose boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega is nice (e.g., a smooth manifold or a polygon), and u_{xx} and u_{yy} denote the second derivatives with respect to x and y, respectively. The problem P1 can be solved directly by computing antiderivatives. However, this method of solving the boundary value problem (BVP) works only when there is one spatial dimension and does not generalize to higher-dimensional problems or problems like u+u=f. For this reason, we will develop the finite element method for P1 and outline its generalization to P2. Our explanation will proceed in two steps, which mirror two essential steps one must take to solve a boundary value problem (BVP) using the FEM. *In the first step, one rephrases the original BVP in its weak form. Little to no computation is usually required for this step. The transformation is done by hand on paper. *The second step is the discretization, where the weak form is discretized in a finite-dimensional space. After this second step, we have concrete formulae for a large but finite-dimensional linear problem whose solution will approximately solve the original BVP. This finite-dimensional problem is then implemented on a computer. =Weak formulation= The first step is to convert P1 and P2 into their equivalent weak formulations. The weak form of P1 If u solves P1, then for any smooth function v that satisfies the displacement boundary conditions, i.e. v=0 at x=0 and x=1, we have (1) \\\\int_0^1 f(x)v(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\int_0^1 u(x)v(x) \\\\, dx. Conversely, if u with u(0)=u(1)=0 satisfies (1) for every smooth function v(x) then one may show that this u will solve P1. The proof is easier for twice continuously differentiable u (mean value theorem), but may be proved in a distributional sense as well. We define a new operator or map \\\\phi(u,v) by using integration by parts on the right-hand-side of (1): (2) \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_0^1 f(x)v(x) \\\\, dx & = \\\\int_0^1 u(x)v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = u'(x)v(x)_0^1-\\\\int_0^1 u'(x)v'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = -\\\\int_0^1 u'(x)v'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\equiv -\\\\phi (u,v), \\\\end{align} where we have used the assumption that v(0)=v(1)=0. The weak form of P2 If we integrate by parts using a form of Green's identities, we see that if u solves P2, then we may define \\\\phi(u,v) for any v by :\\\\int_\\\\Omega fv\\\\,ds = -\\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u \\\\cdot abla v \\\\, ds \\\\equiv -\\\\phi(u,v), where abla denotes the gradient and \\\\cdot denotes the dot product in the two-dimensional plane. Once more \\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\phi can be turned into an inner product on a suitable space H_0^1(\\\\Omega) of once differentiable functions of \\\\Omega that are zero on \\\\partial \\\\Omega. We have also assumed that v \\\\in H_0^1(\\\\Omega) (see Sobolev spaces). Existence and uniqueness of the solution can also be shown. A proof outline of existence and uniqueness of the solution We can loosely think of H_0^1(0,1) to be the absolutely continuous functions of (0,1) that are 0 at x=0 and x=1 (see Sobolev spaces). Such functions are (weakly) once differentiable and it turns out that the symmetric bilinear map \\\\\\\\!\\\\,\\\\phi then defines an inner product which turns H_0^1(0,1) into a Hilbert space (a detailed proof is nontrivial). On the other hand, the left-hand-side \\\\int_0^1 f(x)v(x)dx is also an inner product, this time on the Lp space L^2(0,1). An application of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces shows that there is a unique u solving (2) and therefore P1. This solution is a-priori only a member of H_0^1(0,1), but using elliptic regularity, will be smooth if f is. Discretization A function in H_0^1, with zero values at the endpoints (blue), and a piecewise linear approximation (red) P1 and P2 are ready to be discretized which leads to a common sub-problem (3). The basic idea is to replace the infinite-dimensional linear problem: :Find u \\\\in H_0^1 such that :\\\\forall v \\\\in H_0^1, \\\\; -\\\\phi(u,v)=\\\\int fv with a finite- dimensional version: :(3) Find u \\\\in V such that :\\\\forall v \\\\in V, \\\\; -\\\\phi(u,v)=\\\\int fv where V is a finite-dimensional subspace of H_0^1. There are many possible choices for V (one possibility leads to the spectral method). However, for the finite element method we take V to be a space of piecewise polynomial functions. =For problem P1= We take the interval (0,1), choose n values of x with 0=x_0 and we define V by: :V=\\\\\\\\{v:[0,1] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R\\\\;: v\\\\mbox{ is continuous, }v_{[x_k,x_{k+1}]} \\\\mbox{ is linear for } k=0,\\\\dots,n \\\\mbox{, and } v(0)=v(1)=0 \\\\\\\\} where we define x_0=0 and x_{n+1}=1. Observe that functions in V are not differentiable according to the elementary definition of calculus. Indeed, if v \\\\in V then the derivative is typically not defined at any x=x_k, k=1,\\\\ldots,n. However, the derivative exists at every other value of x and one can use this derivative for the purpose of integration by parts. A piecewise linear function in two dimensions =For problem P2= We need V to be a set of functions of \\\\Omega. In the figure on the right, we have illustrated a triangulation of a 15 sided polygonal region \\\\Omega in the plane (below), and a piecewise linear function (above, in color) of this polygon which is linear on each triangle of the triangulation; the space V would consist of functions that are linear on each triangle of the chosen triangulation. One hopes that as the underlying triangular mesh becomes finer and finer, the solution of the discrete problem (3) will in some sense converge to the solution of the original boundary value problem P2. To measure this mesh fineness, the triangulation is indexed by a real-valued parameter h > 0 which one takes to be very small. This parameter will be related to the size of the largest or average triangle in the triangulation. As we refine the triangulation, the space of piecewise linear functions V must also change with h. For this reason, one often reads V_h instead of V in the literature. Since we do not perform such an analysis, we will not use this notation. =Choosing a basis= To complete the discretization, we must select a basis of V. In the one-dimensional case, for each control point x_k we will choose the piecewise linear function v_k in V whose value is 1 at x_k and zero at every x_j,\\\\;j eq k, i.e., :v_{k}(x)=\\\\begin{cases} {x-x_{k-1} \\\\over x_k\\\\,-x_{k-1}} & \\\\mbox{ if } x \\\\in [x_{k-1},x_k], \\\\\\\\\\\\ {x_{k+1}\\\\,-x \\\\over x_{k+1}\\\\,-x_k} & \\\\mbox{ if } x \\\\in [x_k,x_{k+1}], \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{ otherwise},\\\\end{cases} for k=1,\\\\dots,n; this basis is a shifted and scaled tent function. For the two-dimensional case, we choose again one basis function v_k per vertex x_k of the triangulation of the planar region \\\\Omega. The function v_k is the unique function of V whose value is 1 at x_k and zero at every x_j,\\\\;j eq k. Depending on the author, the word \\"element\\" in the \\"finite element method\\" refers either to the triangles in the domain, the piecewise linear basis function, or both. So for instance, an author interested in curved domains might replace the triangles with curved primitives, and so might describe the elements as being curvilinear. On the other hand, some authors replace \\"piecewise linear\\" by \\"piecewise quadratic\\" or even \\"piecewise polynomial\\". The author might then say \\"higher order element\\" instead of \\"higher degree polynomial\\". The finite element method is not restricted to triangles (or tetrahedra in 3-d, or higher-order simplexes in multidimensional spaces), but can be defined on quadrilateral subdomains (hexahedra, prisms, or pyramids in 3-d, and so on). Higher-order shapes (curvilinear elements) can be defined with polynomial and even non-polynomial shapes (e.g. ellipse or circle). Examples of methods that use higher degree piecewise polynomial basis functions are the hp-FEM and spectral FEM. More advanced implementations (adaptive finite element methods) utilize a method to assess the quality of the results (based on error estimation theory) and modify the mesh during the solution aiming to achieve an approximate solution within some bounds from the exact solution of the continuum problem. Mesh adaptivity may utilize various techniques, the most popular are: *moving nodes (r-adaptivity) *refining (and unrefined) elements (h-adaptivity) *changing order of base functions (p-adaptivity) *combinations of the above (hp- adaptivity). = Small support of the basis = Solving the two-dimensional problem u_{xx}+u_{yy}=-4 in the disk centered at the origin and radius 1, with zero boundary conditions. (a) The triangulation. (b) The sparse matrix L of the discretized linear system (c) The computed solution, u(x, y)=1-x^2-y^2. The primary advantage of this choice of basis is that the inner products :\\\\langle v_j,v_k \\\\rangle=\\\\int_0^1 v_j v_k\\\\,dx and :\\\\phi(v_j,v_k)=\\\\int_0^1 v_j' v_k'\\\\,dx will be zero for almost all j,k. (The matrix containing \\\\langle v_j,v_k \\\\rangle in the (j,k) location is known as the Gramian matrix.) In the one dimensional case, the support of v_k is the interval [x_{k-1},x_{k+1}]. Hence, the integrands of \\\\langle v_j,v_k \\\\rangle and \\\\phi(v_j,v_k) are identically zero whenever j-k>1. Similarly, in the planar case, if x_j and x_k do not share an edge of the triangulation, then the integrals :\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} v_j v_k\\\\,ds and :\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla v_j \\\\cdot abla v_k\\\\,ds are both zero. =Matrix form of the problem= If we write u(x)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n u_k v_k(x) and f(x)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n f_k v_k(x) then problem (3), taking v(x)=v_j(x) for j=1,\\\\dots,n, becomes :-\\\\sum_{k=1}^n u_k \\\\phi (v_k,v_j) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n f_k \\\\int v_k v_j dx for j=1,\\\\dots,n. (4) If we denote by \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{f} the column vectors (u_1,\\\\dots,u_n)^t and (f_1,\\\\dots,f_n)^t, and if we let :L=(L_{ij}) and :M=(M_{ij}) be matrices whose entries are :L_{ij}=\\\\phi (v_i,v_j) and :M_{ij}=\\\\int v_i v_j dx then we may rephrase (4) as :-L \\\\mathbf{u} = M \\\\mathbf{f}. (5) It is not necessary to assume f(x)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n f_k v_k(x). For a general function f(x), problem (3) with v(x)=v_j(x) for j=1,\\\\dots,n becomes actually simpler, since no matrix M is used, : -L \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{b}, (6) where \\\\mathbf{b}=(b_1,\\\\dots,b_n)^t and b_j=\\\\int f v_j dx for j=1,\\\\dots,n. As we have discussed before, most of the entries of L and M are zero because the basis functions v_k have small support. So we now have to solve a linear system in the unknown \\\\mathbf{u} where most of the entries of the matrix L, which we need to invert, are zero. Such matrices are known as sparse matrices, and there are efficient solvers for such problems (much more efficient than actually inverting the matrix.) In addition, L is symmetric and positive definite, so a technique such as the conjugate gradient method is favored. For problems that are not too large, sparse LU decompositions and Cholesky decompositions still work well. For instance, MATLAB's backslash operator (which uses sparse LU, sparse Cholesky, and other factorization methods) can be sufficient for meshes with a hundred thousand vertices. The matrix L is usually referred to as the stiffness matrix, while the matrix M is dubbed the mass matrix. =General form of the finite element method= In general, the finite element method is characterized by the following process. *One chooses a grid for \\\\Omega. In the preceding treatment, the grid consisted of triangles, but one can also use squares or curvilinear polygons. *Then, one chooses basis functions. In our discussion, we used piecewise linear basis functions, but it is also common to use piecewise polynomial basis functions. Separate consideration is the smoothness of the basis functions. For second-order elliptic boundary value problems, piecewise polynomial basis function that is merely continuous suffice (i.e., the derivatives are discontinuous.) For higher-order partial differential equations, one must use smoother basis functions. For instance, for a fourth- order problem such as u_{xxxx}+u_{yyyy}=f, one may use piecewise quadratic basis functions that are C^1. Another consideration is the relation of the finite-dimensional space V to its infinite-dimensional counterpart, in the examples above H_0^1. A conforming element method is one in which space V is a subspace of the element space for the continuous problem. The example above is such a method. If this condition is not satisfied, we obtain a nonconforming element method, an example of which is the space of piecewise linear functions over the mesh which are continuous at each edge midpoint. Since these functions are in general discontinuous along the edges, this finite- dimensional space is not a subspace of the original H_0^1. Typically, one has an algorithm for taking a given mesh and subdividing it. If the main method for increasing precision is to subdivide the mesh, one has an h-method (h is customarily the diameter of the largest element in the mesh.) In this manner, if one shows that the error with a grid h is bounded above by Ch^p, for some C<\\\\infty and p>0, then one has an order p method. Under certain hypotheses (for instance, if the domain is convex), a piecewise polynomial of order d method will have an error of order p=d+1. If instead of making h smaller, one increases the degree of the polynomials used in the basis function, one has a p-method. If one combines these two refinement types, one obtains an hp-method (hp-FEM). In the hp-FEM, the polynomial degrees can vary from element to element. High order methods with large uniform p are called spectral finite element methods (SFEM). These are not to be confused with spectral methods. For vector partial differential equations, the basis functions may take values in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Various types of finite element methods =AEM= The Applied Element Method or AEM combines features of both FEM and Discrete element method, or (DEM). = Generalized finite element method = The generalized finite element method (GFEM) uses local spaces consisting of functions, not necessarily polynomials, that reflect the available information on the unknown solution and thus ensure good local approximation. Then a partition of unity is used to ‚Äúbond‚Äù these spaces together to form the approximating subspace. The effectiveness of GFEM has been shown when applied to problems with domains having complicated boundaries, problems with micro- scales, and problems with boundary layers. =Mixed finite element method= The mixed finite element method is a type of finite element method in which extra independent variables are introduced as nodal variables during the discretization of a partial differential equation problem. =Variable ‚Äì polynomial= The hp-FEM combines adaptively, elements with variable size h and polynomial degree p in order to achieve exceptionally fast, exponential convergence rates.P. Solin, K. Segeth, I. Dolezel: Higher-Order Finite Element Methods, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2003 =hpk-FEM= The hpk-FEM combines adaptively, elements with variable size h, polynomial degree of the local approximations p and global differentiability of the local approximations (k-1) to achieve best convergence rates. =XFEM= The extended finite element method (XFEM) is a numerical technique based on the generalized finite element method (GFEM) and the partition of unity method (PUM). It extends the classical finite element method by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions. Extended finite element methods enrich the approximation space so that it can naturally reproduce the challenging feature associated with the problem of interest: the discontinuity, singularity, boundary layer, etc. It was shown that for some problems, such an embedding of the problem's feature into the approximation space can significantly improve convergence rates and accuracy. Moreover, treating problems with discontinuities with XFEMs suppresses the need to mesh and re-mesh the discontinuity surfaces, thus alleviating the computational costs and projection errors associated with conventional finite element methods, at the cost of restricting the discontinuities to mesh edges. Several research codes implement this technique to various degrees: 1\\\\. GetFEM++ 2\\\\. xfem++ 3\\\\. openxfem++ XFEM has also been implemented in codes like Altair Radios, ASTER, Morfeo, and Abaqus. It is increasingly being adopted by other commercial finite element software, with a few plugins and actual core implementations available (ANSYS, SAMCEF, OOFELIE, etc.). =Scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM)= The introduction of the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) came from Song and Wolf (1997). The SBFEM has been one of the most profitable contributions in the area of numerical analysis of fracture mechanics problems. It is a semi-analytical fundamental- solutionless method which combines the advantages of both the finite element formulations and procedures and the boundary element discretization. However, unlike the boundary element method, no fundamental differential solution is required. =S-FEM= The S-FEM, Smoothed Finite Element Methods, is a particular class of numerical simulation algorithms for the simulation of physical phenomena. It was developed by combining meshfree methods with the finite element method. =Spectral element method= Spectral element methods combine the geometric flexibility of finite elements and the acute accuracy of spectral methods. Spectral methods are the approximate solution of weak form partial equations that are based on high-order Lagrangian interpolants and used only with certain quadrature rules. =Meshfree methods= =Discontinuous Galerkin methods= =Finite element limit analysis= =Stretched grid method= = Loubignac iteration = Loubignac iteration is an iterative method in finite element methods. Link with the gradient discretization method Some types of finite element methods (conforming, nonconforming, mixed finite element methods) are particular cases of the gradient discretization method (GDM). Hence the convergence properties of the GDM, which are established for a series of problems (linear and non-linear elliptic problems, linear, nonlinear, and degenerate parabolic problems), hold as well for these particular finite element methods. Comparison to the finite difference method The finite difference method (FDM) is an alternative way of approximating solutions of PDEs. The differences between FEM and FDM are: *The most attractive feature of the FEM is its ability to handle complicated geometries (and boundaries) with relative ease. While FDM in its basic form is restricted to handle rectangular shapes and simple alterations thereof, the handling of geometries in FEM is theoretically straightforward. *FDM is not usually used for irregular CAD geometries but more often rectangular or block shaped models. *The most attractive feature of finite differences is that it is very easy to implement. *There are several ways one could consider the FDM a special case of the FEM approach. E.g., first-order FEM is identical to FDM for Poisson's equation, if the problem is discretized by a regular rectangular mesh with each rectangle divided into two triangles. *There are reasons to consider the mathematical foundation of the finite element approximation more sound, for instance, because the quality of the approximation between grid points is poor in FDM. *The quality of a FEM approximation is often higher than in the corresponding FDM approach, but this is extremely problem-dependent and several examples to the contrary can be provided. Generally, FEM is the method of choice in all types of analysis in structural mechanics (i.e. solving for deformation and stresses in solid bodies or dynamics of structures) while computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tend to use FDM or other methods like finite volume method (FVM). CFD problems usually require discretization of the problem into a large number of cells/gridpoints (millions and more), therefore the cost of the solution favors simpler, lower-order approximation within each cell. This is especially true for 'external flow' problems, like airflow around the car or airplane, or weather simulation. Application Visualization of how a car deforms in an asymmetrical crash using finite element analysis. A variety of specializations under the umbrella of the mechanical engineering discipline (such as aeronautical, biomechanical, and automotive industries) commonly use integrated FEM in the design and development of their products. Several modern FEM packages include specific components such as thermal, electromagnetic, fluid, and structural working environments. In a structural simulation, FEM helps tremendously in producing stiffness and strength visualizations and also in minimizing weight, materials, and costs. FEM allows detailed visualization of where structures bend or twist, and indicates the distribution of stresses and displacements. FEM software provides a wide range of simulation options for controlling the complexity of both modeling and analysis of a system. Similarly, the desired level of accuracy required and associated computational time requirements can be managed simultaneously to address most engineering applications. FEM allows entire designs to be constructed, refined, and optimized before the design is manufactured. The mesh is an integral part of the model and it must be controlled carefully to give the best results. Generally the higher the number of elements in a mesh, the more accurate the solution of the discretized problem. However, there is a value at which the results converge and further mesh refinement does not increase accuracy. Finite Element Model of a human knee joint. This powerful design tool has significantly improved both the standard of engineering designs and the methodology of the design process in many industrial applications.Hastings, J. K., Juds, M. A., Brauer, J. R., Accuracy and Economy of Finite Element Magnetic Analysis, 33rd Annual National Relay Conference, April 1985. The introduction of FEM has substantially decreased the time to take products from concept to the production line. It is primarily through improved initial prototype designs using FEM that testing and development have been accelerated. In summary, benefits of FEM include increased accuracy, enhanced design and better insight into critical design parameters, virtual prototyping, fewer hardware prototypes, a faster and less expensive design cycle, increased productivity, and increased revenue. alt= alt= In the 1990s FEA was proposed for use in stochastic modelling for numerically solving probability models and later for reliability assessment.

Seeley turned pro on October 29, 1963 by fighting a four round draw with Mike Rosario at Sunnyside Garden Arena in Sunnyside, Queens. Seeley's professional record was 16 wins no losses and two draws when he met tough Dominican fighter Jose Fernandez on October 8, 1971 at the Felt Forum in New York City. The bout ended in a ten round draw. Two months later on December 10, 1971 at Madison Square Garden Seeley lost for the first time in his career to Jose Fernandez by unanimous decision over ten rounds. After the loss to Jose Fernandez Seeley ran off three straight wins including an impressive eight round decision over Davey Vasquez at Madison Square Garden on June 26, 1972. This fight was on the undercard of the Ken Buchanan, Roberto Dur√°n Lightweight Championship fight in which Roberto Dur√°n won the title. Seeley followed the Vasquez victory by defeating Jose Fernandez by majority twelve round decision at Madison Square Garden on August 28, 1972. Seeley captured the North American Super Featherweight title with the victory over Jose Fernandez. Seeley would lose the North American Super Featherweight title on March 9, 1973 to world contender Sammy Goss. Seeley suffered another setback when he traveled to the west coast. On April 28, 1973 Seeley was TKO'd in two rounds by former Champion Rub√©n Olivares at the Forum in Inglewood, California. Seeley returned to New York and defeated Eduardo Santiago by ten round decision at the Felt Forum in New York City. On August 27, 1973 Seeley defeated Vilomar Fernandez by ten round decision at the Felt Forum. Vilomar Fernandez is best known for defeating the great champion Alexis Arg√ºello.

The Gymnasium underwent a $1.2 million renovation in the summer of 2008 and reopened in time for the 2009 Stony Brook women's volleyball season. The Gymnasium has been the home for several concerts, including Phish, The Notorious B.I.G., Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, and U2. Stony Brook men's basketball returned to the Pritchard Gymnasium beginning in 2008 as the Stony Brook Arena underwent renovations. The America East Tournament Finals were held at Pritchard Gym in 2014. During the time when Stony Brook played home games at Pritchard, it played two postseason games at the otherwise dormant Stony Brook Arena: a 2010 NIT game against Illinois, and the 2012 America East Tournament Finals against Vermont. The team moved back into the Stony Brook Arena, which reopened as the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, in the fall of 2014.

Starting in 2016, the men's team will play six regular season games at the Redhawk Center, with possible plans for even more home games in the future here. The school cites the change to getting more student involvement, a more intimate home setting, the success of hosting CBI games here the last two years, and the lack of attendance at KeyArena.

Game summary =1st Half= Cork got off to a great start when kick returner David Barry took the opening kick-off back deep into Vikings territory. The Admirals threatened to score, but were stopped on the 15-yard line by the Vikings defense. The Admirals defense held the Vikings offence on their very first possession of the game, forcing them to punt the ball. The key play for the Admirals on the ensuing possession was a 40 yard draw play by fullback Alain Pezeron which got them a first and goal on the Vikings 3-yard line. Two plays later, Cork‚Äôs Keith O‚ÄôCallaghan scored from 3 yards out, following the linemen to the goal line. Pezeron got the 2-point conversion to make the score 8-0 Admirals. The Vikings got back into the game shortly afterwards. Quarterback Chris Bassitt led them down field on helped by running backs Andrew Gordon and Seamus Hogan, before Hogan scored a touchdown on a 5-yard run up the middle. Bassitt got the 2-point conversion to level the scores at 8-8. Both defenses dominated the second quarter in which there were a number of good defensive plays on both sides of the ball. The Vikings defenders Declan O‚ÄôDonnell, Damien Laffan and Alan O‚ÄôCarroll made a number of key tackles. On the other side of the ball, the Admirals defensive line of Marcus Gates, Ross McCullough and Barry Rea forced some tackles for loss. With less than 5 minutes to go to half time, Vikings' cornerback Daniel Smith got the first turnover of the day when he picked off a pass intended for Dominic MacHale. However, Vikings' kicker Adrian Garvey missed a field goal and the score remained 8-8 until the half. =2nd Half= The second turnover of the game came on the very first play from scrimmage after half time. Admirals linebacker Martin Mulvey recovered an Andrew Gordon fumble to give the Admirals the ball on the Vikings 20-yard line. The Admirals scored a touchdown shortly afterwards on a pass from David Lomasney to receiver Dominic MacHale to give them a 14-8 lead. The Vikings then drove into scoring range getting a 1st and goal on the Admirals 5-yard line. However, a defensive stand by the Admirals prevented a score after they stopped the Vikings on 4th down. The Vikings defense then ensured that their offense got the ball back in good field position when they forced the Admirals to punt after not picking up much yardage on the ensuing possession. This gave the Vikings the ball at midfield and, through runs by Bassitt and Gordon, they got to the 10-yard line. Then Seamus Hogan scored his second touchdown, running up the middle on a draw play and pushing the ball over the goal line as Admirals defenders attempted to tackle him. Adrian Garvey's single point conversion gave the Vikings a one point lead. The Vikings defense stopped the Cork Admirals again, forcing them to punt the ball early in the 4th quarter. This time the Vikings caught the Admirals' defense off guard as they went to the air with a long pass from Bassitt to receiver Marc Ashworth who was stopped on the Admirals 5-yard line. On the next play, game MVP Seamus Hogan sealed the award with his third touchdown of the day, as he bounced his run to the right and found the corner of the endzone, which was also converted to give the Vikings a 22-14 lead. However, the game was far from over. Admirals quarterback David Lomasney led the Admirals on a long drive, during which O‚ÄôCallaghan and Pezeron both contributed big yardage. After Seamus Hogan stopped O‚ÄôCallaghan just short of the endzone, the Admirals looked like they would be sending the game into overtime with a first down on the Vikings 2-yard line. However, the Vikings defense came up with their best defensive performance of the afternoon and held them out on all four downs. The Vikings then tried to run out the clock on the ensuing possession, but were forced to punt after only picking up one first down. With just over 2 minutes remaining, Daniel Smith got off a great punt, pinning the Admirals back inside their own half. But the Admirals still had more than enough time to score. They picked up a couple of first downs, but were stopped on 4th down with less than 30 seconds remaining on the clock as they tried to convert with a Statue of Liberty play to Alan Pezeron. The Vikings then kneeled down to win their first ever Shamrock Bowl, 22-14.

History of the locomotive shed  The shed, itself, has a long history. As early as 1849, with the construction of the Ludwig South-North Railway from Lindau to Hof, a workshop appeared for the maintenance of steam locomotives and wagons. Wings 2 and 3 of the roundhouse date from this time; since then they have just been extended. The workshop building, too, dates from the 1800s, as well as the floor plan of the first recorded engine shed. The facility was regularly expanded and its use adapted in the course of time up to 1937. The last expansion was carried out from 1935 to 1937, when the locomotive shed was lengthened and a 20-metre turntable installed. A major event in its history were the air attacks during the Second World War in 1944 and 1945, when large parts of the shed were destroyed. Only wings 2 and 3 of the roundhouse were spared, as well as the workshop building and the water tower. The facility was rebuilt and in places modernised in the years up to 1949. For a short period the locomotive shed experienced new life as it was allocated V 100 diesel locomotives, VT 98 railbuses and ETA 150 accumulator cars. By 1966 the routine stabling of steam locomotives had ended. With the electrification of the Ries Railway (Riesbahn), Donauw√∂rth‚ÄìAalen, and the Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen railway many of the diesel engines were dispensable, so that in 1982 the locomotive shed was closed as an independent facility. The closure of the branch lines radiating from N√∂rdlingen did one more thing to return peace to the entire station at N√∂rdlingen. In 1985 the railway maintenance division was moved out and operations as a satellite of Augsburg locomotive shed ceased.  Establishment of the museum  In autumn 1985 the Bavarian Railway Museum took over the partially dismantled facilities. Since then, the museum has painstakingly attempted to equip it as a complete locomotive shed again. Several tracks had to be relaid and all the locomotive shed roads connected to the turntable. In addition two water cranes were re- installed. In the near future a coaling facility should also be brought into operation.  Current museum railway operations  The Bavarian Railway Museum works the route to Gunzenhausen259a and the section from N√∂rdlingen to Feuchtwangen259 on the line to Domb√ºhl with historical vehicles. Its daughter company, BayernBahn Betriebsgesellschaft mbH, is responsible for the maintenance of the line to Domb√ºhl rented from the Deutsche Bahn as well as the operation of museum vehicles on special trains, but also for other services, for example in maintenance of way trains. In addition, for several years impressive goods trains have been hauled in the N√∂rdlingen area e.g. for wood and timber products. For this Class V 100 und V 60 diesel locomotives are usually used, but sometimes the museum's steam engines are engaged as well.

Lengwe's topography is unusual for Malawi and consists of open deciduous forests and dense thickets. It is the home of the reclusive Nyala antelope. The climate of Lengwe is hot and dry, and the only source of consistent water is from the rain. Many man- made water holes have been constructed to attract and maintain the animal population. Jambo Africa Ltd operates Nyala Lodge for visitors. Animals that inhabit this park are the giraffe, spotted hyena, leopard, warthog, kudu, impala, Samango monkey, reedbuck, Cape buffalo and suni. Interesting birds, particularly shrikes, rollers, bee-eaters and the Yellow-spotted nicator. History In 1928, Lengwe was established as a Game Reserve to protect the large mammals found in the Lower Shire Valley, especially the nyala antelope and its habitat. This protection is important as the Lower Shire Valley is the farthest north where nyala can be found naturally. At that time, the protected area measured 520 square kilometers. Later, it was reduced to 120 square kilometers in order to provide land for agriculture. This 120-km2 is what is now referred to ‚ÄúOld Lengwe.‚Äù This did not contain the year-round water supply to the animals that the Shire had provided, 964 and 1970, four artificial waterholes were built throughout the area, and in 1970, Lengwe was given national park status. In 1975, the extension area was added, increasing the size to 887 square kilometers. Lengwe was expanded mainly to protect the catchment areas of the Shire, Mwanza, and Nkombedzi wa Fodya rivers. The extension also has the effect of protecting beautiful rock outcrops in the area and increasing the dispersal area for wildlife.

The reserve's animal populations were decimated during the late 1970s and 1980s due to poaching and other human activities. Majete has been managed by African Parks since 2003, when the nonprofit conservation organization entered into a public‚Äìprivate partnership with the Malawi Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW). Since then, wildlife has been restored, the park has achieved big five game status, and tourism has increased. Description and geography Majete Wildlife Reserve is a protected area in the lower Shire River valley, near Blantyre (Malawi's second largest city) and the Kapachira Falls. Majete's entrance includes a heritage centre, which displays confiscated trapping devices for capturing buffalo and other animals, and homemade muzzleloaders retrieved from poachers. of the park's core sanctuary area are reserved for visitors participating in safaris. History Majete has served as a nature reserve since 1955, but reportedly \\"was a wildlife sanctuary in name only\\" by 2002. During the late 1970s and 1980s, charcoal burning, logging, and poaching decimated the area's wildlife, leaving few game other than antelope. The park's last elephant was killed in 1992. African Parks entered into a 25-year public‚Äìprivate partnership with the Malawi Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) in March 2003. By 2013, the park's perimeter was fenced, 24-hour patrolling was established, infrastructure were improved, and community programs were created to support local residents. Additionally, of dirt roads were added, and the reserve established a lodge called Thawale, an education and visitor centre, and a campsite operated by locals. Majete's 12 rangers have increased to 140 full-time employees, and, as of 2016, no elephants or rhinos had been poached in the park since these improvements were made in 2003. Flora and fauna The nature reserve features savanna and woodland ecosystems, including riparian forest. Plants in Majete include Acacia, Brachystegia, Sterculia, and tall grasses. The park has more than 12,200 animals, as of late 2016. Majete became Malawi's first big five game reserve (referring to African buffalo, African elephants, African leopards, lions, and rhinoceros) when the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks reintroduced lions in August 2012. Other mammals in the park include common eland, duiker, hippopotamus, impala, monkeys, nyala, reedbuck, sable and other antelopes, warthogs, waterbuck, and zebras. Reptiles include crocodiles and tortoises. Birds include the African finfoot, B√∂hm's bee-eater, Egyptian goose, and racket-tailed roller, as well as others in the order Anseriformes. Recorded arachnid species include the golden silk orb-weaver. Poaching had eliminated the park's rhinoceros population during the 1970s, and the last of Majete's 300-strong elephant population was killed in 1992. In the 2000s, conservation efforts were implemented to restore animal populations. Black rhinos returned to Majete in 2003. African Parks relocated 70 elephants from Liwonde National Park and Mangochi Forest Reserve to a fenced sanctuary within Majete in mid 2006. More elephants were relocated in 2008 and 2009. In 2012, two male and two female lions were translocated from South Africa, but one female died during the relocation. In 2018, five additional lions were brought in, to increase the genetic diversity of the reserve's pride. There are now 18 lions in Majete by late 2019. More than 2,000 animals were reintroduced to the park by 2013, costing approximately US$3 million (or ¬£1.5m). During 2016‚Äì2017, African Parks relocated approximately 500 elephants from Liwonde National Park and Majete Wildlife Reserve to Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve.National Geographic: * * This translocation was undertaken to repopulate and restore Nkhotakota as a secure elephant sanctuary, and to relieve pressure on habitats in Majete and Liwonde from the surplus of elephants in those parks. There were reportedly 400 elephants in Majete in mid 2017. In 2018, 13 giraffes were translocated from South Africa to the park, in order to boost tourism and increase its conservation value. In 2019, five cheetahs were also translocated to the reserve. Tourism Tourism in Majete has increased as animal populations were restored, and especially after the park achieved big five game status following the reintroduction of lions in 2012. Majete reportedly received almost no tourists during the early 2000s. This increased to 315 visitors in 2006, and more than 4,500 guests by 2011. Mkulumadzi, a luxury lodge along the Shire River operated by Robin Pope Safaris, opened in mid 2011 and features eight riverside bush chalets, as of 2013. The Maravi Post reported there were approximately 7,000 tourists in 2016, contributing $400,000 in gross revenue which supports the park's conservation efforts and management. Local communities also benefit from the funds, which have been used to construct a malaria research and prevention centre in Majete, support beekeeping projects, and provide scholarships to students, among other activities and programs.

The park's hilly terrain features dambos and miombo woodlands as the dominant vegetation, which support a variety of mammal and bird species. Poaching has greatly reduced the number of elephants and other large mammals in Nkhotakota, but conservation efforts to restore the elephant population started when African Parks began managing the reserve in 2015. History The park's miombo woodlands, 2011 The park has been vulnerable to charcoal burning, logging, and poaching. In 2012, the Global Environmental Facility invested $850,000 through the \\"Effective Management of the Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve\\" project to improve management of the reserve, with a focus on its Bua watershed area. The nonprofit organization African Parks started managing the reserve in 2015, and immediately began working to make Nkhotakota \\"ecologically and socially sustainable\\" by increasing animal populations and reducing poaching by hiring and training rangers. The organization's twenty- year agreement with Malawi's government through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife was administered by the Public Private Partnership Commission. During 2016‚Äì2017, African Parks relocated approximately 500 elephants from Liwonde National Park and Majete Wildlife Reserve to Nkhotakota. The $1.6 million project was funded by Nationale Postcode Loterij and the Wyss Foundation, among other donors. Buffalo, elands, impalas, kudu, sables, warthogs, waterbuck, and zebras were also relocated. Prior to the relocation, African Parks worked to create roads, establish a fence around Nkhotakota, create a sanctuary within the reserve, and \\"completely [overhaul] the law enforcement and anti-poaching efforts\\" to make the park safer. Prince Harry assisted during both years of the relocation.Prince Harry:  * * One of the park's guards in 2011 In 2017, African Parks received $65 million from the Wyss Foundation to support management efforts of Nkhotakota and other national parks, including Liwonde, Majete, and Rwanda's Akagera National Park, among others. Geography and topography Nkhotakota is an 1,800-square- kilometre (700 square miles), wildlife reserve located near Lake Malawi, in the Great Rift Valley. It borders the Kasungu District, Mzimba District, Nkhotakota, and Ntchisi District. The reserve extends from the edge of the escarpment above the Great Rift Valley at , down to the narrow plain beside Lake Malawi at . The terrain is rugged and wild, with the rough slopes and ridges being much dissected by rivers and gorges. The land slopes from west to east, and is carved by three major rivers leading to Lake Malawi. Flora and fauna Nkhotakota features dambos (wetlands) and large areas of miombo woodland with Brachystegia trees and long grasses. There are some dense stands of forest alongside the rivers and a patch of mid-altitude rainforest on Chipata Mountain.BirdLife International (2019) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 02/09/2019. Poaching in recent decades reduced the elephant population from 1,500 to fewer than 100 in 2015. Other large mammals such as the common eland, the waterbuck, the southern reedbuck and the hippopotamus have also declined in numbers. However, after African Parks gained management of the reserve in 2015, more than 520 elephants and 2,000 other animals (including over 100 buffalo) were moved from Liwonde National Park and Majete Wildlife Reserve to Nkhotakota between July 2016 and August 2017. The park is also home to antelope, baboons, leopards, and warthogs. In 2015, The Maravi Post said that Nkhotakota had the potential to restore locally extinct black rhinoceros, cheetah, lion, and African wild dog populations. In 2019, camera traps recorded the presence of roan antelope and honey badger in the park; both species were thought to be locally extinct. The reserve is the only location in Malawi where the rufous trident bat is found. Some 280 species of bird have been recorded in the reserve and there are likely to be considerably more than this figure. They vary in size from tiny iridescent kingfishers to large martial eagles. The Taita falcon has been recorded twice near the escarpment and may breed there. Other bird species include the olive-headed weaver, the B√∂hm's bee-eater, the Arnot's chat, the Anchieta's sunbird, the B√∂hm's flycatcher, the miombo wren-warbler, the Souza's shrike, the Chapin's apalis, the miombo rock thrush, the miombo scrub robin and the miombo double-collared sunbird. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Tourism British philanthropists and a Malawian opened the Tongole Wilderness Lodge in May 2011, which has contributed to revitalization efforts to restore miombo woodlands, increase animal populations, and expand the size of Nkhotakota's team of 27 rangers to further protect wildlife. The luxury lodge's charity, the Tongole Foundation, supports local communities and schools and, as of 2012, plans to partner with Malawi's Department for National Parks and Wildlife to combat poaching and increase populations of buffalo, kudu, sable, and other wildlife. Bentry Kalanga serves as the lodge's managing director, as of 2013. The Bua River Lodge, a tented camp overlooking the Bua River near the eastern boundary of the reserve, was established by British expatriate and soil conservationist John Dickinson in 2010. It offers modest accommodations, wildlife viewing, and other activities, as well as day trips to Chipata Mountain, which has a campsite frequented by self-navigating tourists.

She was born in Aspen, Colorado, the second child of Sam and Ida Nestell. She had five siblings. During her childhood, she lived in or near small coal mining towns. Career At Columbia University in New York, Fortner earned a Master of Arts degree, which qualified her to receive a provisional teacher's certificate. Her first use of it was, at the age of 19, teaching in a log cabin style one-room schoolhouse, a position she held for two years. She then attended Western State College in Gunnison for a year (1927‚Äì1928), earning her a lifetime teaching certification for the state of Colorado, which she used to work instructing in a mining camp. However, she was ready for something different. So in 1931 she moved to Oregon, accepting a position in Salem teaching at the historic Oregon School for the Blind. Here she would teach and become principal during her 12-year stay. She would also become married to Laurence Wilbur Fortner (1912‚Äì1982), a fellow teacher, and receive a BA in psychology from the University of Oregon, both in 1937. Her next position, lasting until some time after World War II, was as Vision Supervisor in the Oregon State Department of Education. She left this to join her husband (who was then working for the Veteran's Administration) for a year in Seattle. The Fortners moved to a farm close to Estacada, Oregon; Ethel began teaching and administrating again for thirteen more years before retiring. Retirement and second career Now Fortner spent her time on other, more personal interests, most notably her poetry, and painting in water colors. She had composed poetry for her own pleasure since 1927, only now committing herself to writing for others. She finally published one poem, in 1962 in the newspaper The Oregonian; the poem entitled \\"December Morning\\". She became editor of Human Voice Quarterly. Fortner eventually published above two hundred poems, in various periodicals and also in four collections, and received the first place award in the Oregon State Poetry Association contest in 1964. and the \\"Voice of the Year\\" publication awards in 1967. She contributed prolifically to the St. Andrews Review and was instrumental in the early funding of the St. Andrews College Press of St. Andrews Presbyterian College. The Ethel Fortner Award was instituted in her honor in 1986. Fortner is interred at Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, Oregon. Her grave marker is also her late husband's, who preceded her in death by a little over four years. ;Selected works * A sudden clarity (1967) * Clouds and keepings (1973) * Nervous on the curves (1982) References Category:1907 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Aspen, Colorado Category:Poets from Oregon Category:People from Estacada, Oregon Category:American women poets Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Ethel Fortner"},{"id":"18234901","text":"Ashorocetus is a monotypic genus of an extinct primitive baleen whale of the family Aetiocetidae. It was named by , and contains one species, A. eguchii. Fossils of this whale are found from the Chattian Morawan formation, near Ashoro, of upper Oligocene () Hokkaido, Japan (, paleocoordinates ). Ashorocetus eguchii was described based on a partial skull and is named after the type locality and Kenichiro Eguchi of the Ashoro Museum of Paleontology. (including an illustration of the holotype) Description described four new aetiocetid species, of whom Ashorocetus eguchii was the most primitive. It has a neatly telescoped skull and is closely related to Chonecetus, another primitive aetiocetid. Barnes et al. also described Morawanocetus yabukii, a more derived species with a foreshortened braincase, intermediate between Chonecetus and Aetiocetus; Aetiocetus tomitai, the most primitive Aetiocetus discovered; and Aetiocetus polydentatus, the most derived Aetiocetus with a highly telescoped cranium and both homodont and polydont dentition. Barnes et al. also proposed three subfamilies for Aetiocetidae (Chonecetinae, Morawanocetinae, and Aetiocetinae) to reflect this proposed evolution within the family. The placement of A. polydentatus in Aetiocetus has, however, been questioned, as has the monophyly (and therefore the proposed subfamilies) of Aetiocetidae.

The academic hospital has 651 beds (including bassinets) and provides services to some 42,000 inpatients each year. In addition, approximately 500,000 outpatient visits and services are logged annually. New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital offers specialized care in the following areas: advanced and minimally invasive surgery, advanced otolaryngology, asthma and lung disease, cancer care, cardiology and cardiac surgery, diabetes and other endocrine disorders, digestive and liver disorders, healthy aging, neurosciences, orthopedic medicine and surgery, vascular medicine and surgery, and women's health. NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital is affiliated with Weill Cornell Medicine and is a teaching hospital for SUNY Downstate College of Medicine. Name change In January 2017, New York Methodist Hospital became part of the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Healthcare System network and the name was changed to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. History Founded in 1881, NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital was the first Methodist hospital in the country. The original Romanesque Revival-style building was replaced in the 1930s. On December 16, 1960, a mid-air collision over Staten Island left 134 people dead; one of the two aircraft that had collided crashed in Park Slope in Brooklyn. The only initial survivor, Stephen Baltz, an 11-year-old boy from Illinois, was thrown from that aircraft onto a snowbank. Badly burned and having inhaled burning fuel, he was taken to what was then Brooklyn's Methodist Hospital, where he succumbed to pneumonia the next day. A plaque outside the hospital commemorates the event. In 2014, the hospital announced plans to construct a \\"Center for Community Health\\" on property already owned by the facility. A local community group, Preserve Park Slope, filed a lawsuit to overturn a decision by the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals to approve plans for the building. Construction began on the $445 million project in 2016 despite vigorous community opposition.
