It is kept in the History Museum of Armenia, under the number 2867-1. The goblet was found in 1987 by Vahan Hovhannisyan in the village of Karashamb, in the Kotayk province, during the excavation of a tomb from the Bronze Age.  Description  The goblet has six horizontal inlaid belts, which have impressions of the ancient Indo-European mythological plot. The goblet's stem is cylindrical, and made of silver-tin method. It is decorate with multiple stories completed with six frieze sculptures.’Ä’°’µ’°÷Å÷Ñ ’¢÷Ä’∏’∂’¶’• ’§’°÷Ä’´÷Å, ‘±’¨’¢’∏’¥-’Ø’°’ø’°’¨’∏’£, ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂’´ ’∫’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ’©’°’∂’£’°÷Ä’°’∂, 2016, 160 ’ß’ª: A Glance from the Bronze Age. Yerevan, History Museum of Armenia, 2016, 160 pages. The first main frieze image is of boar hunting, depicting a hunter's arrow stuck in his shoulder. Kneeling on his right leg, the hunter has his bow set up on his lap, ready to shoot. In front of the wounded boar there is a lion, and behind there is a leopard. They are followed by an intermitted group of lions and leopards. Behind the hunter, there is a dog standing with a rope tied around his neck. On the second frieze, there are three narrative scenes presented: a ritual ceremony, armed conflict, and defeated enemy raid. The first scene's main character is a king on a throne (god). In front of him, there are altars with ritual vessels and ministering priests. The priests are bringing a male deer to the altar, which has an image of a crescent highlighted under his belly as a sacrificial symbol. Ritually, this ceremony complements \\"the King's\\" supported fans kept by two servants and minstrel played by musicians. The purpose of the ceremony was to claim victory against the enemy that was being fought, which was represented by images of men with spears and drawn swords. The third plot is a scenery that contains a triumphant march of spears. Leading the march walks the unarmed captive. In the third frieze, the main character is the king again, sitting on the throne, with a sack in his hand, a disk symbolizing the sun on his head to emphasize his divine origin. In front of him, there is an image of a strategist and the decapitated heads of the enemy. On the left, the disarmament of the defeated \\"king\\", on the right, the scene of this attack. There is also pictured the beheaded enemies lined up entering the afterlife. The afterlife is bordered by fabulous Anzudi allegoric imagery. This fantastic creature in the ancient Sumerian-Akkadian mythology was related to the war and with the underworld. The second allegoric picture presents a goat surrendering to the lion as a symbol of power and victory. Pictured in the fourth frieze are rows of lions and leopards one after another toward the left. The fifth frieze contains sharp-edged petals that form the rose. The leg of the goblet is completely dedicated to the sixth frieze, where there is pictured only a lion with his pack and leopard couples. Part of the goblet's decoration includes the lions' and leopards' frequent recurrent pictures linked to Indo-European mythology with ancient symbolism. As for the lion and the leopard, they were going out as the king's double symbols. The cup contains important information about the period of social hierarchy, material and spiritual culture.

The partners were Henry E. Abbey, John B. Schoeffel and Maurice Grau. Abbey and Schoeffel had been in partnership since 1876, and joined forces with Grau in 1882. They managed and ran a number of theatres in New York and Boston, including the Metropolitan Opera House (\\"the old Met\\") in 1883-4 and from 1891‚Äì1896, when Abbey died. Schoeffel and Grau remained at the Met until 1903. Although individual biographies may individually credit them with bringing various singing, instrumental and acting stars to the US, the overall credit can be shared by all three, acting as a successful partnership for some sixteen years. Grau and Schoeffel had their own success from 1896 until 1903. History Henry Abbey and John Schoeffel became partners in the theatre business in 1876, Abbey dealing with the artiste management and Schoeffel looking after the business side. They began by hiring the Academy of Music, Buffalo, NY (1852‚Äì1956)\\"Academy Theater, 245 Main Street, Buffalo, NY 14203\\". Cinema Treasures.

They took the lease of Booth's Theatre, New York City, from Dion Boucicault on 1 January 1880 until 1 May 1881. NB Much detail about the Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau partnerships. On 8 March 1880 they formed the company of Abbey and Schoeffel. They engaged Helena Modjeska and Sarah Bernhardt at Booth's Theatre in 1880 and 1881, and secured the lease of the Grand Opera House (formerly Pike's Opera House) in 1882. They managed Christina Nilsson, Henry Irving and Lillie Langtry on tours of the US; the latter's d√©but was delayed when Abbey's New Park Theatre burned down on October 30, 1882. In 1882 Abbey and Schoeffel invited Maurice Grau to join them. Grau had been managing light opera companies for some time before striking out on his own with the Maurice Grau Opera Company, which in 1881 had given a five-week season at the Teatro Solis in Montevideo, Uruguay. With a Brazilian conductor named GravensteinBrazilian violinist & conductor, see Gravenstein, Andre at MusicSack. Retrieved 22 May 2017. they presented a mix of grand opera and operettas: La traviata in French, Carmen, Donizetti's La fille du r√©giment, Thomas' Mignon, Victor Mass√©'s Paul et Virginie, Offenbach's La P√©richole and Lecocq's Girofl√©-Girofla. The three men formed the company of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau to present grand opera. The partnership continued until the death of Mr. Abbey whose methods eventually cost him all his fortune and deprived Mr. Grau as well of his savings. They presented the 1883-4 opening season of the 'old' New York Metropolitan Opera House, which was a critical success but a financial failure. Abbey as manager was personally responsible for losses of $250,000. (subscription required) The London-based banker Henry F. Gillig lost $200,000 in the Abbey-Grau Met debut. The firm returned to light opera and touring European acts including Henry Irving and Ellen Terry from 1884. From 1887-1888 they leased the Star Theatre (844 Broadway at 13th Street, previously Wallack's Theatre), and also from 11 October 1887 to July 1888 the then current Wallack's Theatre on 30th Street and Broadway. They built the Tremont Theatre, Boston in 1888, managed by Schoeffel. Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau again took up the challenge of grand opera, with a short season with Adelina Patti in 1887 at the Met, and in 1888 at the Teatro Solis, Montevideo; this was followed by a season of grand opera at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago in 1889, and tours of the US with Patti, Nordica, and Albani in 1890. They returned to the Met in 1891, with Abbey managing for five years. Abbey's Theatre (at 1396 Broadway and West 38th Street) was built in 1893. By 1895 the firm of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau was in severe financial difficulties, and asked for extension of time to meet their obligations. The indebtedness was completely paid off. However, on 22 May 1896 the company failed with unsecured liabilities of $369,419.36 and actual assets of $162,54.85. Abbey had been ill. On June 30 the directors of the Metropolitan Opera and Real Estate Company renewed their lease and continued with their contract to produce grand opera. The creditors received 40% preferred stock and 60% in notes of the firm of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau, which had been newly incorporated on July 1896 with $500,000 capital, of which $200,000 was preferred stock. The new organisation started free from debt, but Abbey died in October 1896. Schoeffel and Grau continued in business, with Grau taking over the management of the Met from 1896‚Äì7, and of Covent Garden from 1897 to 1900. Grau left the Met at the end of 1902‚Äì3 season, retired to Paris and died in 1907. Schoeffel continued to manage the Tremont Theatre in Boston until his death in 1918.

The word kot is used in both Belgian Dutch and Belgian French, but not in standard Dutch or standard French. Etymology The word comes from Flemish and means small shelter, nest, cabin (as in friet kot, a chip shed, or kot √† poule, a chicken coop). It can also even refer to slums. This term specifically used in Belgium refers to a cupboard (un kot √† balais, a broom cupboard) and by extension any small room such as a student room. It emphasizes the narrow aspect which is typically encountered in such housing. These kots can be either individual or part of a shared house, in which a certain area is public (the kitchen, the toilets and showers, etc.) casually called \\"commu\\" (rooms shared in common). The word kot is still in use in the Dunkirk dialect, pronounced ‚Äúkotsheu‚Äú (a small kot), meaning a shed, a garden shed, a junk room. Derived words include: *the verb kotter (\\"to kot\\"), which means to rent and inhabit a kot, usually only during the week *the nouns kotteur and kotteuse refer to the tenant of a kot and often by extension to every student living outside the family home *the nouns cokotteur or cokotier and cokotteuse (or cokoti√®re), which mean housemate. Project kots Some community kots take part in a project, in particular in Louvain-la-Neuve. These \\"project kots\\" offer a large variety of activities. The project could be organizing a weekly spaghetti party, homework support, supporting a humanitarian organization. The only boundary is the creativity in management skills and the ability to bring people together.

The TIF procedure, similar to Nissen fundoplication, alleviates GERD symptoms by wrapping a portion of the stomach around the esophagus. The TIF procedure, unlike laparoscopic fundoplication, does not require surgical incisions. Instead a surgical device (called the EsophyX) is inserted into the mouth, passed through the throat, and into the stomach. An endoscope is utilized to perform the procedure. A minority of individuals who undergo the TIF procedure also require a hiatal hernia repair operation. The procedure is performed while the person is under general anesthesia and is typically an outpatient procedure. Medical use Transoral incisionless fundoplication may improve symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease, at least in the short term. Benefits from the TIF procedure may last for up to 6 years. About 1 in 30 people have major complications from the procedure.  History  The device utilized to perform the procedure, called EsophyX, was developed by EndoGastric Solutions. The first TIF procedure utilizing the device was performed in 2005. The device received European Union CE mark in 2006 and United States Food and Drug Administration issued initial 510(k) clearance in 2007. In February 2015, the American Medical Association's CPT Editorial Panel reviewed whether to create a new category 1 current procedural terminology (CPT) code for the TIF procedure. In January 2016, a unique code for the transoral incisionless fundoplication procedure was created and implemented. As of 2016, more than 17,000 TIF procedures had been performed. In July 2016, Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) became the first United States health insurance company to add the TIF procedure to their medical coverage policy. HSCS added the TIF procedure to their health insurance policy at the recommendation of both the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES).

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433698 on 2017-05-11 Description The length of the shell attains 8 mm, its diameter 4 mm. The shell has an oval subfusiform shape, with a short turriculate and acuminate spire. The crystalline white shell is opaque and matt on the ribs, hyaline shining on the decurring cords. The whorls are tinted with a tan yellow color, more or less interrupted at the interstices. The last brown bands are usually reduced to enlarged spots on the ridge of the ribs, and are sometimes accompanied by a fifth zone. In the dorsal part, the coloring of the strips becomes darker with a tendency to widen and produce on the penultimate rib a large brown spot. The shell Is decorated with longitudinal ribs, 10 on the body whorl. These are moderately thick and very high. They mark on the upper whorls a space equal to their thickness, which widens at the back of the body whorl. From the suture on, above which they rise, the less prominent ribs descend obliquely flexuously towards the siphonal canal, where they form a cluster of concentric arcs. Cords, somewhat high, narrow and pressed together, run transversely across the whole shell by crossing the ribs. These shiny cords alternate with translucent and matte intervals and offer a graceful effect. They appear under a lens as a very fine lattice, produced by the growth lines. The spire consists of 6 to 7 whorls, including 1¬Ω whorls in the protoconch. The embryonic whorls are rounded and smooth. The intermediate whorls of the spire are convex, separated by a linear undulating suture, and appear canaliculate by the elevation of the ribs. The body whorl measures about 3/5 of the total height of the shell. It has a rather bulging appearance and its profile is regularly convex. The length of the aperture is equivalent to half the height of the shell. The aperture is narrow, obliquely elongated, with a continuous peristome. The interior of the aperture is of a white porcelain. The columella is oblique and is furrowed by many unequally prominent plicae. The very short, wide siphonal canal deviates slightly back. The outer lip has, seen from the front, a uniformly convex and flexuous profile. It is strongly thickened on the last rib, and we observe, beneath its sharp lip, a bead of enamel on which are inscribed eight folds. The rounded sinus, obliquely open, is situated in the recess of the outer lip, and is strongly thickened.Hervier, J. 1898.

Early life William Gregory Wood-Martin was born in County Sligo in Ireland on 16 July 1847 in the midst of the Great Famine. His parents, James Wood and Anne Martin, were also both natives of County Sligo and, as their only child, he was the heir to both the Woodville and Cleveragh estates. Wood-Martin received his early education at home, and completed his academic training first in Switzerland, and then in Belgium. Military career Upon the completion of his education, in 1866 he joined the British Army and studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after which he was commissioned into the 24th Regiment. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the 8th Brigade, North Irish Division, and spent the remainder of his career attached to the Sligo Artillery and the Sligo Rifles, where he was lieutenant colonel in command between April 1883 and November 1902. He received medals for his service as an Aide-de-Camp (militia) from three successive British Monarchs; Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and King George V.Martin A. Timoney, Richard James Wood-Martin, and Richard Gregory Wood-Martin, \\"William Gregory Wood-Martin, Sligo Antiquarian, Some Notes and Images,\\" The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, 2006. Marriage and return to Sligo In 1873, Wood-Martin married Frances Dorothea Dodwell-Robinson, another Sligo native, who joined him first in Brighton and then in Dublin, following the demands of his career. In 1877 Wood-Martin returned to Cleveragh House, his mothers' family home in east Sligo town, to care for his ailing father. Upon his return, Wood-Martin was appointed as High Sheriff of Sligo, and served in this role for a year. The income from his estates likely served as the bulk of his financial support at the end of this term, however he was active in his community and served as a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of the County. The Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland Though Wood-Martin became a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1883, and both published with and presented to that august body, his association with the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland, (later the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland), dominated his antiquarian career. Wood-Martin became a fellow of the Association in October 1882, and was appointed as The Local Secretary for Sligo in 1883. That fall, he hosted a meeting of the Association in Sligo. In 1886, when the men holding the positions of Honorary Provincial Secretary for Connaught for the Association and Editor of the Association's journal died, Wood-Martin was appointed to these positions. In January 1888, Wood-Martin became the Associations Honorary Secretary alongside William Frederick Wakeman. Wood- Martins membership in the Association was a troubled one. His Editorship only lasted for three years, and a quiet fog of scandal hangs over his departure. There were ongoing issues between Wood-Martin and the Council of the Association about the size and contents of the journal, as well as his apparent misplacing of some valuable wood blocks which belonged to the Association. He resigned as Editor in 1889, and ceased publishing in the journal. He left the organisation entirely in 1892. Afterwards, Wood-Martin began publishing in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology as a member of the Ulster Archaeological Society, which had just been founded. Personal life and death Wood-Martin and his wife, Francis Dorothea, had six children; James Isadore, Henry Roger, Gregory Gonville, Francis Winchester, Frances Nora, and Annette Kathleen. Only three of his children survived him; Henry Rodger, Gregory Gonville, and Annette Kathleen, and only Gregory married and had children. Wood-Martin died on 16 November 1917 at his Cleveragh estate. His children erected a granite memorial to his memory in the cemetery at St. Anne‚Äôs in Strandhill, Co. Sligo.

History In 1996, two nature enthusiasts wanted to establish a structure to sensitize the population of Hotton to the wealth of the Ourthe. The project quickly became bigger with the idea of creating a \\"Showcase of Fauna and Flora\\" in the garden of the Maison Godenir, thanks to the support of the City and the Region. From 2004, with European funding, several regional actors set up an \\"Interpretive Centre of the River\\" cell within the tourist information office of Hotton. In March 2007, because of its success, the non-profit-making organization Interpretive Centre of the River became independent and opened its doors on a wildlife and river discovery site that would quickly expand its environmental awareness activities. In 2008, the Interpretive Centre of the River continued to develop with an ongoing project for fishing tourism supported by various regional and European partners. The aim was to set up fishing areas, to create appropriate signage, to train guides recognized by the Tourism Commission and to set up activities (initiation, improvement) for various fishing techniques, equipment provided etc. In 2010, the Interpretive Centre of the River got a facelift and became RIVEO (les rives et l‚Äôeau: \\"the banks and the water\\"). Description Riveo offers several environmental awareness activities. * A complex of 16 aquariums and a reconstructed river arm allowing visitors to discover the different species of the region. * Thematic exhibitions in didactic form allowing visitors to discover the river and its fauna (crayfish, beavers ‚Ä¶). * Nature and fishing activities with guides to discover the fauna and the richness of the river. * Activities related to fishing (crayfish, trout). * An eighteen- hole mini-golf course to practice in the 5 thematic gardens (monastic, Moorish, labyrinth, renaissance and contemporary).

The club received national recognition for advancing past fourth-division sides Fredericksburg FC and Chicago FC United and the second-division side Richmond Kickers in the 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. The team reached the fourth round, before they lost to Major League Soccer's D.C. United. Christos opened the scoring, which received national attention. The team qualified again in 2018, losing in the first round to Reading United AC in a penalty kick shootout, and in 2020. In November 2018, the team launched a partnership with FC Baltimore of the National Premier Soccer League. The two teams began to share resources while the newly named \\"FC Baltimore Christos\\" continued to compete in the NPSL. The club is also two-time Werner Fricker National Open Cup champions (2016, 2018) and won the USASA National Amateur Cup in 2016.

Description The length of the shell attains 4.5 mm, its diameter 2 mm. The small, short shell has an oval shap with a scalar spire. It is distinctly angular in the upper part of the whorls. The shell has a translucent crystal white color. It is adorned with fairly high longitudinal ribs, well rounded, leaving between them an interval equal to twice their thickness. Originating at the suture, they descend obliquely, followed by accentuating the angulation of the whorls and go in describing a very flexuous contour to the siphonal canal where they are concentrated. These chords are surmounted by decurrent, numerous and very thin costae, which, evenly spaced, traverse the whole height of the whorls without being accompanied by intermediate striations. The shell contains 6 whorls. The two embryonic ones are rounded, smooth and of a white shiny horny color; The whorls of the spire are staggered in a scalarly manner and separated by an undulating linear suture. In their upper part, they are plane, but then slope downward. They then become strongly angulate, below of which they offer a flat to convex profile, and are compressed by the lower suture. The body whorl measures 3/5 of the total height;. After having undergone a more obtuse angle than that of the upper whorls, the body whorl presents (on the opposite side to the outer lip) a more convex profile, weakly depressed below the middle. The aperture is oblique, narrowly oblong, approximately equal to half the total height. The peristome is continuous. The columella is smooth, obliquely directed and weakly concave in its upper part. The outer lip, seen from the front, is angular at the top and presents below the angle an oblique flat to convex profile. The sinus, located between the suture and the angulation, is rounded, obliquely and deeply lodged in the recess of the last rib.Hervier, J. 1898.

It is designed to parse several programming languages at the same time (PL/SQL, Transact-SQL, PowerBuilder...) and analyze cross-language dependencies, in addition to each language's source code.  Features  * Code exploration: call graphs, CRUD matrix, cross-references, dependency graphs. * Software documentation: a documentation generator produces technical documentation and low-level design descriptions. * Code comparison: finds differences between several versions of the same code. * Automated code review: calculates software metrics and source lines of code. Finds unused objects and methods. Identifies duplicate objects. Controls naming conventions.  Usage  Visual Expert is used in several contexts: * Change impact analysis: evaluating the consequences of a change in the code or in a database. Avoiding negative side effects when evolving a system. * Program comprehension: helping programmers understand and maintain existing code, or modernize legacy systems. Transferring knowledge of the code, from one programmer to another. * Software sizing: calculating the size of an application, or a piece of code, in order to estimate development efforts. * Code review: auditing source code, in order to discover issues, such as dead code, code causing poor performances or violations of programming conventions.  Limitations  * As a static code analyzer, Visual Expert is limited to the programming languages supported by its code parsers - Oracle PL/SQL, SQL Server Transact-SQL, PowerBuilder. * A preliminary reverse engineering is required, with a duration depending on the size of the code parsed. Users must wait for the parsing completion prior to using the features, or schedule it in advance. * Visual Expert is based on a client/server architecture: the code analysis is running on a windows PC - preferably a server. The information extracted from the code is stored in a RDBMS, communicating with a client application installed on the programmer‚Äôs computer - no web client is available. This requires that the code, the parsers, the RDBMS and the programmers‚Äô computers are connected to the same LAN or VPN.

For the ƒåech nerve of an open cover one can show that if the space X is compact and if every intersection of open sets in the cover is contractible, then one can contract these sets and get a simplicial set that is weakly equivalent to X in a natural way. For the √©tale topology and other sites, these conditions fail. The idea of a hypercover is to instead of only working with n-fold intersections of the sets of the given open cover \\\\mathcal U, to allow the pairwise intersections of the sets in \\\\mathcal U=\\\\mathcal U_0 to be covered by an open cover \\\\mathcal U_1, and to let the triple intersections of this cover to be covered by yet another open cover \\\\mathcal U_2, and so on, iteratively. Hypercoverings have a central role in √©tale homotopy and other areas where homotopy theory is applied to algebraic geometry, such as motivic homotopy theory. Formal definition The original definition given for √©tale cohomology by Jean-Louis Verdier in SGA4, Expose V, Sec. 7, Thm. 7.4.1, to compute sheaf cohomology in arbitrary Grothendieck topologies. For the √©tale site the definition is the following: Let X be a scheme and consider the category of schemes √©tale over X. A hypercover is a simplicial object U_\\\\bullet of this category such that U_0 \\\\to X is an √©tale cover and such that U_{n+1} \\\\to (\\\\operatorname{cosk}_n \\\\operatorname{sk}_n U_\\\\bullet)_{n+1} is an √©tale cover for every n\\\\geq 0. Properties The Verdier hypercovering theorem states that the abelian sheaf cohomology of an √©tale sheaf can be computed as a colimit of the cochain cohomologies over all hypercovers. For a locally Noetherian scheme X, the category HR(X) of hypercoverings modulo simplicial homotopy is cofiltering, and thus gives a pro-object in the homotopy category of simplicial sets. The geometrical realisation of this is the Artin-Mazur homotopy type. A generalisation of E. Friedlander using bisimplicial hypercoverings of simplicial schemes is called the √©tale topological type.

The company is owned by HIG Europe who acquired the company on 10 May 2011, following a period in administration. The company also has exclusives rights to make & sell Sealy mattresses in the UK & Ireland and operates the Sealy factory in Cumbria. The company also manufactures Rest Assured beds & mattresses and was originally founded in 1946. History The brand is Silentnight, and the company name is Silentnight Group. The company was founded on 11 July 1946 by Tom Clarke. It was founded as Clarke's Mattresses Limited in Skipton with the gratuity paid to Tom after he was demobbed from the Royal Navy. The name was changed to Silentnight Limited in 1951 at the suggestion of Tom's wife, Joan. Clarke later said that the name change was a brainwave that brought millions into the company. Barnoldswick industrial building during Silentnight strike ‚Äì June 1986 During the 1980s, and again in the 2000s and the 2010s, the company was the United Kingdom's largest bed manufacturer. For 18 months between 1985 and 1987, the company had a drawn out strike which is the longest strike action against one company in Britain, which took place over 616 days. Workers went out on strike from two of the Silentnight factories at the time, Barnoldswick and Sutton-in-Craven due to an increased demand by management upon production scales. The union also claimed that an agreement had been reached whereby the workforce would not press for a pay rise provided the company did not enforce any redundancies. Eight weeks later, 52 members of staff were made redundant. As a result of the strike, 346 workers were sacked by the company. The strike gained much support from the miners and the Labour Party. Whilst the strike was discussed at length in Parliament and it was noted for its generally passive nature, there were incidents of rock throwing and one notable event when the strikers' caravan was firebombed. The chief executive at the time was Tom Clarke, the company's founder, who was a supporter of the Conservative Party and friend of Margaret Thatcher, who gave him the nickname of Mr Wonderful. This led to the strikers erecting boards at the picket line which read \\"Mr Wonderful's scabs cross here\\". Following a loss of confidence stock market the Clarke family bought out smaller shareholders and made the company private in 2003, but the company collapsed under the weight of its pension commitments and went into administration before its rescue by HIG Europe in 2011. Much of the existing management was replaced in 2011, including the Clarke family. =Ownership= The company floated on the stock market in 1973 but due to market uncertainty and a loss of confidence with the management, the Clarke family took full possession of the company again in 2003 and the company became private. The companies fortunes declined in private ownership and, in May 2011, the company was saved from receivership by HIG Europe, a private equity company. HIG Europe spent ¬£19 million acquiring the company, but in doing so, shelved some of the pension scheme rights for retired and current workers. The Pensions regulator served notice in 2013 that they would start legal proceedings to reverse this process and force HIG to re-invest ¬£17.2 million back into the company's pension pot. Structure The company employs around 1,250 people in the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, in Pendle, where the company has been based since 1949, and in its current premises since 1961. The company has one other active factory that manufactures beds under the Sealy brand located at Aspatria in Cumbria. The company also operates a digital office on Quay Street in Manchester. Formerly, the company had factories in Sutton-in-Craven (1970‚Äì1994), Batley (closed March 2012) and Keighley, which was closed in March 2002. All of these, and the Barnoldswick plant, were in the former West Riding of Yorkshire when the company was started. The boundary change of 1974, put the Barnoldswick factory in Lancashire. The plant is a major employer in the area alongside the Rolls-Royce jet engine facility in the town. The company also had other plants around the United Kingdom as a result of its acquisitions of rival companies. Two plants in South Wales and Andover , which were part of the Ducal brand, were closed when the company re organized and went private in 2003. Many jobs from the closed Keighley factory were transferred to Sunderland, but this plant was sold off as a management buyout under the Stag Furniture brand in June 2005. During the period of ownership by HIG both turnover and profits have increased markedly, after the initial management clear-out & implementations of the turn round plan. Turnover grew by over 50% between 2012 & 2017 & a pre-tax loss of ¬£4.5m was turned into a pre-tax profit of ¬£11.6m in the same time period. Pre-takeover * 2008/09 turnover was ¬£110.8m * 2009/10 turnover was ¬£107.1m Post-takeover * 2012/13 turnover was ¬£98.9m with pre-tax loss of ¬£4.5m * 2013/14 turnover was ¬£109.3m with pre-tax loss of ¬£3.2m * 2014/15 turnover was ¬£125.1m with pre-tax profit of ¬£3.3m * 2015/16 turnover was ¬£137.5m with pre-tax profits at ¬£3.9m * 2016/17 turnover was ¬£152.1m with pre-tax profits of ¬£11.6m Brands * Layezee * Perfecta * Rest Assured * Sealy * Silentnight * Studio * The Pocket Spring Bed Company  See also  * Adrian Fawcett References External links * Silentnight Group Category:Bed manufacturers Category:British companies established in 1946 Category:Companies based in Lancashire Category:Furniture companies of England Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1946 Category:Mattress retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Borough of Pendle Category:British furniture makers ","title":"Silentnight"},{"id":"54077499","text":"Annie Mutrie or Annie Feray Mutrie (6 March 1826 ‚Äì 28 September 1893) was a British still-life painter.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433735 on 2017-05-18 Description The length of the shell attains 5 mm, its diameter 2.5 mm. The small shell has an oval shape, very shortly turriculated with very short whorls. The color of the shell is a bright opal white, weakly tinted in the middle of the whorls by a yellow strip, more or less interrupted in the interstices of the costae, and repeated three times on the body whorl. The shell is carved with longitudinal costulae and transverse cords. The ribs are raised (numbering 12 in the penultimate whorl), not very thick, leaving between them an interval equal to their width..Starting on a rather impressed suture, they rise a little above it and, rounding off the angle of the whorl, they descend flexuously towards the siphonal canal where their form concentric arcs. Very faint striae cover the shell with a lattice above the costulae. The spire contains 6 whorls. The whorls in the protoconch are rounded, smooth, and with glossy milk white color. The next whorls are well separated by a deep suture. They are flat in their upper part, swollen towards the angle, convex below and strongly decayed at the lower suture. The body whorl, which measures 2/3 of the total height, is convex and regularly attenuated to the base. In its dorsal part, the coloring of the strips becomes more and more accentuated and there are even some extra spots near the suture and the siphonal canal. The aperture is oblique, rather narrow, and shows a continuous peristome. The columella is slightly folded. The outer lip is thickened both externally and internally, and is angularly arched at the top and has a sharp edge. Inside it is obscurely furnished with very feeble folds. The sinus, situated obliquely a little below the suture, Is rounded, shallowly notched in the thickness of the outer lip.Hervier, J. 1898.

The film was released on 21 December 2017. Plot The movie is set in Travancore college in Kerala, where two student groups named Real Fighters and Royal Warriors always quarrel over various issues. Simultaneously, a danseuse Vedika is introduced to the college and the groups war over who will win her love. When Vedika says she is in a relation with Unnikrishnan, who is meek and introvert, Real Fighters make Unni a member of the group and asks him to reciprocate to Vedika. But one night, Vedika is murdered and simultaneously Unni is caught by police for drinking and driving, although released later without any charges. As Vedika's dead body is found behind the men's hostel of the college, her father Shivanandan who is a politician urges the police to find the killer at any cost. The police under ACP John Thekkan IPS start the investigation. Later it leads to Unnikrishnan who received the last phone call from Vedika before her death. John Thekan arrests Unni forcefully and questions him. Later Unni is found dead inside the police lock up. This leads to a quarrel between the police and students, in which John gets seriously injured and hospitalised. In his absence, the investigation is handed over to ACP Bhavani. At the same time, a new English professor named Edward Livingston joins the college. The ACP orders to arrest Roshan, who is the leader of Royal Warriors. This is because according to an evidence the murderer is observed to be nearly 6 feet tall, and Roshan has a similar physique. This leads to yet another dispute between the police and the campus, and the police is prevented by the home minister from entering the campus. Later, Professor Cherian who is the college vice principal and also the father of Roshan, talks to Edward about his life as a divorcee. He tells Eddy that Roshan is innocent as he was at his mother's house at the night the murder happened. In a meeting between the police and campus, Eddy talks to the officials that the students are not responsible for the murder and also that the police is responsible for Unnikrishnan's death. After few days, Vedika's father sends his goons to the college so that the suspected students can be handed over to police. But Eddy intervenes and fights the goons. He also unites the two students' groups and fights the baddies together. Later, new men are appointed in the college as security guards, plumbers and electricians. Eddy closely watches the body language of these men and understands that they are police officers. He warns the students not to leave the campus at any cost. Despite his warning, Roshan and his friends go out to attend a wedding reception, wherein they are spotted by the police. John Thekkan who is back in duty apprehends them and gets hold of Roshan, while his friends escape. Roshan is taken to a hideout but Eddy and team tracks it and saves Roshan. Eddy and the students promise to the police and media that they will find out the murderers of Vedika and Unnikrishnan within ten days. He later asks Roshan to reunite his parents who have been separated, which he does. Roshan's friend Mahesh tells the team that his girlfriend Ramlath is being forced by her family for an alliance which she doesn't like. He goes to meet Ramlath. But he is arrested by police, and Ramlath is taken to custody by SI Ramachandran, who is John Thekkan's close friend. Ramlath is forcefully taken to his guest house where Eddy saves her by beating up Ramachandran. Eddy finds out through Ramachandran that it was none other than ACP John Thekkan who murdered Vedika, and later instructed Ramachandran to murder Unnikrishnan. John had a grudge against Vedika as she along with her friend (who is revealed to be Ramlath) discovered John Thekkan's illegal relationship with Minister Seethalakshmi, who is the wife of a deceased politician Krishnadas. It is revealed that Das was murdered by Thekkan and Ramachandran when he found out his wife's extramarital relation with Thekkan, who was raised by him. Ramlath who understood all these informed Vedika about the same, and Vedika who wanted to inform Unni about this was kidnapped and killed by Thekkan and Ramachandran. Unnikrishnan was arrested on purpose and killed as Thekkan understood Unni had known certain facts about Vedika's death. After Ramachandran reveals all these to the public, he is shot and killed by Thekkan who tries to escape. But Eddy overpowers and kills Thekkan with his gun, after a long fight. In the end, Edward Livingston is himself revealed to be a police officer named Anto Antony, and also that the police officers disguised as workers in the college, were actually his teammates.

History West End Brewery, West Terrace, Adelaide c. 1880 James Chapman, a tailor and draper of Kent, England, emigrated to South Australia with his wife Mary and their seven children aboard Rajah, arriving at Adelaide in April 1850. He founded a drapery on Hindley Street, at that time the premier business strip in the young city. His eldest son Edgar Chapman joined with W. K. Simms in 1865 as Simms & Chapman to operate West End Brewery, which Simms had purchased in 1861. The partnership was dissolved in 1879. Chapman and Caleb Peacock were passengers on the steamer Auckland when she struck a reef between Cape Conran and Cape Everard, on 27 May 1871. The ship was lost but all aboard were rescued by the Macedon. Chapman invested in commercial property on fashionable Hindley Street. In October 1876 he purchased the Theatre Royal, its hotel and the adjoining shops for ¬£11,000, and lost no time in appointing George R. Johnson architect for a complete rebuild of the theatre. This article includes considerable detail of the new design. The rebuilt house, costing about ¬£20,000, was opened on 25 March 1878. In 1878, on the eve of the departure of Mr. and Mrs Chapman and their daughters Clara, Emily Fannie and Lily for a European holiday, he was presented by a throng of prominent citizens with a pair of diamond studs valued at ¬£250 (perhaps $50,000 today), the work of J. M. Wendt. While on holiday he booked various acts for Australia, but with James Alison also leased Drury Lane for an Australian production of Henry V starring George Rignold, perhaps doing something to refute criticisms by the Christian Colonist. He was for any years owner of Kallioota Station, of , some north of Port Augusta, carrying 10,000 sheep and 800 cattle. Beside the Theatre Royal and Theatre Royal Hotel, other properties owned by Chapman in Hindley street were the Eagle Tavern and shops owned by Burns the tailor, McKenzie, Bristow, and Lipman. His sons Charles E. Chapman and Harry A. Chapman ran Mundowdna Station. They voluntarily declared insolvency in order to be relieved of the debt they owed to their father. He died after three or four years of declining health, and his remains were interred at the West Terrace Cemetery. His estate was proved at ¬£59,000 (perhaps $10 million today). His brother Arthur took over management of his estate, which included the Theatre Royal in Hindley Street, though he was acting for Edgar as early as 1883, In January 1885 he had joined Rignold and Allison as lessee and in December they withdrew from the partnership, leaving Chapman as sole manager until Wybert Reeve became lessee in 1887. Arthur Chapman initiated extensive alterations in 1905 at a cost of over ¬£4,000 and a rebuild of the theatre in 1913‚Äì1914 at a cost of ¬£21,000. Other interests He was appointed Justice of the Peace 1877. He was interested in horse racing; served as a steward at the \\"Old Course\\" (Victoria Park). Chapman's affair with the theatre was not only financial. He had a passable singing voice, and \\"trod the boards\\" on occasion: In 1880 he played \\"King Artexomines\\" in Rhodes's Bombastes Furioso. In 1882 he had several landscapes painted to order by H. J. Johnstone. Family James Chapman (1804 ‚Äì 15 June 1879) married Mary Stanford (1804 ‚Äì September 1895).

It runs as a ring road within the city of Munich in Bavaria, is long, and is the most traffic-prone road in Germany. It is called the \\"Middle Ring\\" (German: Mittlerer Ring) because of its concentric position between the Altstadtring and the incomplete Outer Ring, as well as being within the Autobahnring. Traffic importance The Middle Ring is the backbone of all traffic in Munich, since the ring is the fastest connection to all major traffic axes in the city. It replaced all the Bundesstra√üen that ran through the center of the city, even the Bundesstra√üe 2, for which it is named (the R stands for Ring). Within the Middle Ring, there are only municipal streets. From the eight Autobahns that go to Munich, six of them have access to the Middle Ring. The A 8 (towards Salzburg), A 9 (towards Nuremberg-Berlin) and A 96 (towards Lindau) all have direct access to the Middle Ring. The A 94 is connected to the Ring via a short section of the Einsteinstra√üe, but an exit from the A 94 goes directly into the northbound Richard-Strauss-Tunnel on the Middle Ring. The A 95 is connected to the Middle Ring by the B 2, and the A 995 is connected via the B 13. However, both Bundesstra√üen are built to Autobahn standards and signed as such. Only the A 8 towards Stuttgart has a longer connection to the Middle Ring, a 7 km-long section of the Verdistra√üe and Arnulfstra√üe. The A 92 ends at the Autobahnring, but is connected to the Middle Ring via the A 9. The E54 runs along the southwest section of the Middle Ring between the A 96 and the A 995. This section of the route is also particularly affected by long-distance traffic, because neither the motorway ring of the A 99 in the south-west of Munich is closed nor the originally planned Outer Ring has been realized here, meaning the long-distance traffic has to go into the city.

A side effect is an effect that is not intended with normal dosaging. Some of these reactions are visible and some occur in the body's organs or blood. Penicillins are a widely used group of medications that are effective for the treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections in human adults and children as well as other species. Some side effects are predictable, of which some are common but not serious, some are uncommon and serious and others are rare. The route of administration of penicillin can have an effect on the development of side effects. An example of this is irritation and inflammation that develops at a peripheral infusion site when penicillin is administered intravenously. In addition, penicillin is available in different forms. There are different penicillin medications (penicillin G benzathine, penicillin G potassium, Penicillin G sodium, penicillin G procaine, and penicillin V) as well as a number of Œ≤-lactam antibiotics derived from penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin). Side effects may only last for a short time and then go away. Side effects can be relieved in some cases with non pharmacological treatment. Some side effects require treatment to correct potentially serious and sometimes fatal reactions to penicillin. Penicillin has not been found to cause birth defects. Allergies and cross sensitivities Many people have indicated that they have a side effect related to an allergic reaction to penicillin. It has been proposed that as many as 90% of those claiming to have an allergy to penicillin are able to take it and do not have a true allergy. Identifying an allergy to penicillin requires a hypersensitivity skin test, which diagnoses IgE-mediated immune responses caused by penicillin. This test is typically performed by an allergist who uses a skin-prick and intradermal injection of penicilloyl-polylysine, a negative control (normal saline), and a positive control (histamine). A small proportion of people who are allergic to penicilins also have similar cross sensitivities to other antibiotics such as cephalosporins. If someone has developed side effects when taking penicillin, these side effects may develop with a new medication even though the person has not taken the new medication before. Those medications that may cause a cross sensitivity reaction are: carbapenems, ampicillin, cefazolin, cephalosporins and cloxacillin. Side effects in adults Common adverse drug reactions (‚â• 1% of people) associated with use of the penicillins include diarrhea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity, urticaria, and superinfection (including candidiasis). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1‚Äì1% of people) include fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures (especially in people with epilepsy), and pseudomembranous colitis.[subscription required][outdated?] =Very Common (>10% incidence) = *diarrhea *epigastric distress *nausea *vomiting *pseudomembranous colitis *interstitial nephritis *rash *urticaria *eosinophilia *leukopenia *allergic reactions *superinfection =Common (1-10% incidence)= *yeast infection *lack of therapeutic effect *vaginal itching *vaginal discharge *white patches in the mouth and tongue =Uncommon (<1%)= *wheezing *fever *joint pain *lightheadedness *fainting *facial edema (puffiness of the face) *red, scaly skin *shortness of breath *skin rash, hives *irregular breathing =Life threatening= *Anaphylaxis *Serum sickness *Seizures *Laryngeal edema =Rare (<0.1%) = *tooth discoloration *erythema multiforme *vertigo *decreased platelet count *tinnitus *convulsions *hypertonia *cardiac arrest *cyanosis *palpitations *chest pain *macular rash *yellow eyes or skin *stomach or abdominal cramps *severe abdominal pain *bloody diarrhea *depression *decreased urine excretion *sore throat *bleeding or bruising *agitation *combativeness *anxiety *confusion *hallucinations High doses When penicillin is used at high doses hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia can occur. Developing hypernatremia after administering high doses of penicillin can be a serious side effect. Side effects from other medications The side effects of penicillin can be altered by taking other medications at the same time. Taking oral contraceptives along with penicillin may lower the effects of the contraceptive. When probenecid is used concurrently with penicillin, kidney excretion of probenecid is decreased resulting in higher blood levels of penicillin in the circulation. In some instances, this would be an intended therapeutic effect. In other instances, this is an unintended side effect. Neomycin can lower the absorption of penicillin from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower than expected levels of penicillin in the circulation. This side effect may result in an ineffective therapeutic effect of penicillin. When methotrexate is administered with penicillin, toxicity may occur related to methotrexate. In animals Animals are often treated with antibiotics for infections they have developed. There are side effects of penicillin when it is used in animals. MRSA may develop in pets as a consequence of treatment. Nutritional deficiencies can develop in pets as a side effect. Destruction of the normal protective flora of beneficial bacteria can occur in dogs and horses. Dogs may have side effects that include: joint pain, loss of appetite, vomiting, flatulence (instestinal gas), fungal infections and digestive problems. Like humans, dogs can have a similar side effect related to developing a serious allergy. A serious and possibly fatal anaphylactic can occur. Side effects that are concurrent with anaphylaxis include: breathing problems and shock. Cats and dogs have had adverse reactions to intravenous penicillin that include: hypothermia, pruritus, hypotension, tremors, seizures, blindness, vocalization, agitation, cardiac arrest and transient loss of vision. Other side effects  Penicillin is known to become less effective as strains of bacteria become resistant.

The game's artificial intelligence (AI) modifies the neighbor's behavior based on the player's past actions, such as setting traps along paths the player followed in a previous attempt. A sequel, Hello Neighbor 2, is scheduled for release in 2021.  Gameplay  In Hello Neighbor, the player finds themselves moving into a new house across the street from a mysterious neighbor who is behaving in a paranoid manner and seems to be keeping a secret in his basement. The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps. However, the player can use the game settings to turn on \\"friendly\\" neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits. However, he is still to be avoided at all costs. The game is divided into four parts: Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, and Act Finale. The game is played in a first-person perspective, and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them). Up to four items can be kept in an inventory space. Items of the same kind cannot be stacked together in one slot. Plot 267x267px A child named Nicky Roth is playing in the street when he hears a scream from his neighbor's house. Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his basement. Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground dungeon, but finds no sign of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Nicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase. Throughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt. This information was revealed in the book Hello Neighbor: Missing Pieces. Nicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small two room house. When the neighbor spots Nicky he runs aggressively to the window as if to start giving chase, but then shrugs his shoulders and turns away sad. In the other room is a much smaller shadow man. The neighbor has boarded the door up on his side and placed a chair against it. Shadow man is seen standing right by the door on the other side. Behind him is another door with an exit sign above it. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.  Development  The game was released as an alpha build on Dynamic Pixels' website in 2015. It was later approved for sale as an early access game by the Steam Greenlight program and a Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund further development. The studio signed a deal with tinyBuild to publish the game. The first pre-alpha version of the game was released in September 2016. The Alpha 1 version of Hello Neighbor was released on 26 October 2016. Alpha 2 was released on 22 November 2016. Alpha 3 was released on 22 December 2016. Alpha 4 was released on 4 May 2017. The game went into the beta phase on 25 July 2017. For Halloween 2017, a promotional mod was released including multiple elements from the indie game Bendy and the Ink Machine. The mod includes a black and yellow background, ink, music from the game and multiple appearances of Bendy. The game was originally set for a full release on 29 August 2017, but was delayed until 8 December 2017. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on 8 December 2017. A timed Microsoft exclusive, Hello Neighbor was later ported to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and mobile devices. The mobile versions of the game are only supported on a limited number of devices and come with a free trial that allows the player to play through Act 1, with the option to unlock the remaining two Acts and finale with an in-game purchase. Prequel and spin-offs  A prequel, Hello Neighbor: Hide & Seek, was announced in August 2018. Hide & Seek deals with the events of the Neighbor's family that caused him to become a recluse. The game was released on 7 December 2018 on the same platforms as the original game, including non-Microsoft systems. On 10 June 2018, tinyBuild announced a multiplayer spin-off to Hello Neighbor, titled Secret Neighbor. Set between the first two acts of Hello Neighbor, this game follows a group of friends trying to free their friend from the Neighbor's basement, with each friend assuming a certain role and working together to get the keys needed to unlock the basement. However, one of the friends is a Neighbor in disguise and has various abilities at their disposal to confuse, trick, capture or otherwise deter the children from achieving this goal. More than a year after its announcement, the game was finally released on 24 October 2019, exclusively on Microsoft platforms. Another spin-off, Hello Guest, is in development, and a demo has been released. In 2020, an animated series based on the game was announced, and aired for the first time on 17 April 2020. The pilot was watched by more than 11 million viewers within the first week, which to tinyBuild's CEO Alex Nichiporchik, demonstrated the strength of Hello Neighbor as a franchise. In July 2020, tinyBuild acquired the development team from Dynamic Pixels to establish a new studio Eerie Guest Studios, and invested into the Hello Neighbor series.  Sequel  A sequel, Hello Neighbor 2, is set to be released in 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.  Reception  When the game was initially released on Windows, critics gave it negative reviews, admonishing its gameplay, control scheme and technical performance, while some praised the story aspects and art style. Ultimately, the game received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Metacritic gave it \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" and gave a score of 42 out of 100, 39 out of 100 and 38 out of 100 for Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC, respectively.

One person was killed and 20 were injured. Navy veteran Richard Rojas was charged with two counts of second degree murder, 18 attempted murders and 38 assaults, to which he pled not guilty. After being detained, Rojas was found to have ingested phencyclidine before the crash. When interviewed by the NYPD, Rojas said he wanted to die in a \\"suicide by cop\\", and that he had been hearing voices. In a jailhouse news interview three days later, he said he did not remember the incident or any statements he made afterward. A year later, multiple liability lawsuits were filed between Rojas, victims and the city.  Incident  Richard Rojas, the driver of a maroon 2009 Honda Accord, sped into pedestrians in Times Square after having jumped the sidewalk on the west side of Seventh Avenue at 42nd Street. He continued for three blocks before crashing into traffic bollards at the northwest corner of 45th Street and Seventh Avenue, at Broadway. As Rojas was trying to leave his car, a traffic agent tackled him and took him into custody. After having exited the car Rojas said: \\"I wanted to kill them,\\" according to prosecutors.  Victims  Alyssa Elsman, an 18-year-old tourist from Portage, Michigan, was killed and 20 people were injured, four critically.  Suspect  Richard Rojas (born 1991), a 26-year-old resident of the Bronx and a military veteran, was arrested and charged after the crash. He previously served in the United States Navy and had two prior arrests for driving under the influence. These arrests came in 2008 and 2015. He enlisted in the Navy in 2011 and was an electrician's mate fireman apprentice. In 2012, he served aboard the destroyer USS Carney. He was most recently based at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and was discharged in 2014. Rojas was arrested in September 2012 after assaulting a cab driver and yelling at an officer, \\"My life is over\\", and threatening to kill police officers after his release. He also spent two months in military prison in 2013. A neighbor said his family was Dominican. One of his friends said Rojas had developed a drinking problem after his military service, using it as medication for his \\"dark thoughts and moods\\", and posted what the friend described as \\"demonic\\" content on social media. According to authorities and his friends, his mental health issues dated back to his childhood though he never sought psychiatric care, becoming more paranoid and increasing his intake of marijuana and alcohol. Rojas was obsessed with Scientology and had accumulated literature on the religion. He recently got back his car after it was repossessed a short time before the incident. A week before the incident, he was arrested and charged with pointing a knife at a notary, whom he accused of stealing his identity. Investigators looked into his psychological history. In an interview for the New York Post on May 21, he said he had no recollection of the incident or any statements he made when arrested and sought help in the prior week, including speaking to a mental health counselor at a veteran's affairs center, who promised to call him on Monday (May 22).  Aftermath  Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York City, and other officials have said there is no indication the incident was an act of terrorism. Several law enforcement officials said the suspect thought he was hearing voices and expected to die. Rojas tested negative for alcohol, but additional testing was done to determine whether he was taking any drugs. The drug test came back as positive while blood tests were conducted for whether he had taken synthetic marijuana or PCP. Rojas has since offered alternative explanations to the investigators who said they hadn't come to any conclusions. According to a criminal complaint, Rojas admitted smoking marijuana laced with PCP before driving the car. Prosectors said he told the police he wanted to die by suicide by cop. He also rambled that he had been hearing voices and it was the last day on Earth. According to other sources, he said he claimed to hear voices telling him the police were going to kill him. Later, they said he had tested positive for PCP and told police God made him do it. His interview was said to be abnormal and rambling. Legal proceedings Rojas was later charged with second-degree murder, 20 counts of attempted murder, and five counts of aggravated vehicular homicide. On July 13, Rojas, through his lawyer, Enrico DeMarco, pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, 18 attempted murders and 38 assaults. On October 24, DeMarco declined to reveal whether he would attempt an insanity defense, saying he needed \\"another month or so\\" to examine Rojas' possessions, such as notebooks, which the district attorney possesses. Justice Melissa Jackson urged him to hurry before adjourning till December 18. On December 17, he filed notice of his intent to pursue an insanity defense. Rojas will be examined by psychiatrists hired by both sides. =Civil action= In July 2018, Elsman's father and sister sued New York City for unspecified damages, alleging it failed to provide adequate protection from civilian attacks. Rojas was also named as a defendant. The next month, victims Jessica Williams and William Nelson Sr. filed a similar joint suit for $75 million. Rojas countersued the plaintiffs, blaming their injuries on their own culpable conduct, and holding their respective insurance companies solely responsible for paying their expenses. He agreed with their claim that the city was recklessly negligent, and sued it accordingly.

It some areas it is composed of limestone and dolomite. The Waynsboro Formation is one of the formations that make up the Shenandoah Valley. It dates back to the Cambrian period and is not considered fossiliferous. Description The Waynesboro Formation is a predominantly limestone, dolomite, and sandstone formation that is found along the valley floor of the Shenandoah Valley. It can also contain sometimes large beds of siltstone and shale. The Waynesboro is often covered by gravel washes from surrounding mountains or by weathered debris from the formation itself, making finding outcrops for study difficult. The formation is thought to represent a shallow marine depositional environment. It was called the Watuga shale in parts of Virginia, but the name was abandoned in favor of the already established Waynesboro Formation. =Members= The Waynesboro Formation was recognized as having three members in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. These members were later named the Red Run Member, the Cavetown Member, and the Chewsville Member. The Red Run Member is named after Red Run Creek near the Maryland-Pennsylvania state boundary, and forms the basal member of the formation. It consists of calcareous sandstone, sandy dolomite, and calcareous shale. Good exposures of the Cavetown Member are rare, but the member consists of limestone and dolomite with bioturbation with some interbedded sandstone. The youngest member of the Waynesboro Formation is the Chewsville Member, which is named after Chewsville, Maryland. It is composed of interbedded siltstone, sandstone, and shale and is considered the most distinctive member of the formation.

Dresden, 66 x 182 cm Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius is a series of paintings by the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Four panels from the series survive, which are now in three different museums.Davies, 108‚Äì109 Each depicts three or more incidents from the life of Zenobius, an early Bishop of Florence who perhaps died in 417. The works are all in tempera on wood, and around high, though their length varies rather more, from about .Davies, 108‚Äì109 The National Gallery in London has two panels. One of these, Four Scenes from the Early Life of Saint Zenobius shows (left to right): Zenobius rejects the bride chosen by his parents, then walks away; Zenobius is baptized; his mother is baptized by the bishop of Florence; he is consecrated as Bishop of Florence by Pope Damasus (this in Rome). The second London panel shows Three Miracles of Saint Zenobius.Davies, 108‚Äì109; Christiansen The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has a panel with another three miracles, also called by them Three Miracles of Saint Zenobius.Christiansen The Gem√§ldegalerie in Dresden has a panel showing a miracle in three scenes, and the death of the saint.Davies, 109; Dresden, they call it Aus dem Leben des heiligen Zenobius. It is generally agreed that the paintings come from the last phase of Botticelli's career, perhaps c. 1500‚Äì1505; some authorities regard them as possibly the artist's latest surviving works.Davies, 109; Christiansen, who cites the Ettlingers and Lightbown as regarding them as possibly the latest. Lightbown (in 1989) calls them, with the Histories of Lucretia and Verginia \\"the last surviving large paintings\\", dating them \\"c. 1500‚Äì1505\\" and the histories \\"c. 1496‚Äì1504\\", but then discussing the unfinished Adoration of the Magi (Uffizi, \\"c. 1500‚Äì1505\\") last of all, on p.279. Stories of the miracles The New York panel shows: at left Zenobius encounters the funeral procession of a youth, and restores him to life. At centre Zenobius finds a group weeping at the death of a porter who had carried the relics of saints (shown as skeletons in a coffin) over the Apennine range, and restores him to life, with the help of the relics. At right a sub-deacon called Eugenius (who also became a saint) is shown three times: in the bishop's palace interior Zenobius gives him a cup of salt and water, which he carries and then administers to a female relative who had died without receiving the Last Rites, which brings her back to life.Christiansen The London miracle panel has three scenes. At left, two young men had treated their mother badly, and been cursed by her. Zenobius exorcises them. At centre: Zenobius restores to life the son of a \\"noble lady from Gaul\\". She had left him with the bishop while she made a pilgrimage to Rome, and he died. At right, outside the cathedral he restores the sight of a blind beggar, who had promised to become a Christian in that event.Davies, 108‚Äì109 In the Dresden panel a single miracle is shown in three scenes, from left to right. A young man is run over by a cart and killed. His distraught mother, a widow, carries him to the church. He is resurrected by a prayer of Zenobius (not shown) and reunited with his mother. At right, Zenobius on his death bed.Dresden Some scholars, including Martin Davies, thought that the surviving series may not be complete, since one of the better known miracles of the saint, where a dead elm burst into leaf after being touched by the saint's bier, is not shown in any of these scenes.Davies, 109 But this was before the written Life of Zenobius by Fra Clemente Mazza (1475) was identified as the source, rather than another version; the paintings clearly follow the sequence, details and chapter divisions of this, and the sequence appears complete.Lightbown, 269‚Äì278; Christiansen Style and context The Story of Virginia, Accademia Carrara (86 x 165cm) The somewhat stark style of the panels, with contorted figures in anguish and an interest in the architectural backgrounds, is typical of Botticelli's last years. Various degrees of participation in the painting by workshop assistants have been suggested.Lightbown, Chapter 13, especially 266‚Äì268 and 278‚Äì279; Christiansen The drawing of the largely nude figure of Zenobius being baptized has weaknesses, with an arm too puny for the torso and a strange foot. The series is comparable with another pair of paintings from these last years, also now in different museums. These are The Story of Virginia, now in the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo (86 x 165cm), and the Story of Lucretia, now Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston (84 x 177 cm). In these, with a slightly larger scale, both figures, costumes and architecture are more elaborate.Lightbown, 260‚Äì269 The architecture shows contemporary Florentine styles, which are arguably not in general inappropriate to depict the city in about 360‚Äì415. The use of grotesque ornament on the richer buildings is notable. Botticelli has grasped the Roman style so effectively that it is suspected he may have visited Rome since Nero's Golden House was rediscovered around 1480, perhaps for the Holy Year of 1500. In the London panel with the earlier life, the rich building at right represents both an early Florence Cathedral in the baptism and Old Saint Peter's for the consecration by the Pope.Lightbown, 278 The clergy wear essentially contemporary clerical dress, while most of the laity wear \\"iconographic\\" costume, the Renaissance idea of ancient dress, except for men's hats, and the porter, boys and servants, who wear modern dress with shorter jackets. The modern elements in the men's costume, especially the \\"gold-embroidered peaked hats with contrasting turned-up or turban-shaped crowns\\" of the upper-class figures, are rather out of date for 1500.Lightbown, 279 Pigment analysis The two paintings in the National Gallery in London have been investigated recentlyDunkerton, J., Roy, A. 'The Materials of a Group of Late Fifteenth-century Florentine Panel Paintings'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 17, pp 20‚Äì31.Sandro Botticelli, Four Scenes from the Early Life of Saint Zenobius, ColourLexSandro Botticelli, Three Miracles of Saint Zenobius, ColourLex. The pigment analysis revealed the usual pigments of the Italian Renaissance with the exception of ultramarine. Botticelli employed red lake and vermilion for the red robes, azurite, lead-tin yellow, lead white, ochres, and artificial malachite (green verditer). Provenance Detail from New York The panels were possibly commissioned by a religious institution in Florence to be set into wood paneling around a room. It was claimed by C. F. von Rumohr, a German writer, in 1827 that they came from a Compagnia di San Zenobio attached to Florence Cathedral. But it is thought unlikely that they owned any paintings.Davies, 109 Alternatively, they may have been intended for a home. A possible patron was Francesco di Zanobi Girolami (1441‚Äì1515), whose brother commissioned the written Life of Zenobius by Fra Clemente Mazza in 1475. This account is closely followed by Botticelli in all the panels. The Girolami family claimed descent from Zenobius' father, had what was said to be his episcopal ring, and had created two chapels dedicated to him. Two of Francesco Girolami's sons married around this time, in 1497 and 1500, and the commission may have been spalliere given by the father for one of these weddings, probably that of Zanobi Girolami in 1500. This was proposed by Ellen Callmann in an article in 1984. The subjects are not typical for art celebrating a wedding, but in the case of the Girolami family their pride in the connection may well explain this.Christiansen. Citing: Ellen Callmann. \\"Botticelli's 'Life of Saint Zenobius'.\\" Art Bulletin 66 (September 1984), pp. 492‚Äì96; Christiansen's \\"References\\" section give excellent summary notes of the views on this and other matters in the main recent literature. Cecchi (2005) prefers the 1497 wedding. The Dresden panel reached the art market in the 1820s, and entered the museum in 1868. The other panels came from the Rondinelli collection in Florence around the 1880s.Davies, 109 The New York panel was acquired in London by the museum in 1911, having been in an English collection,Christiansen and the London ones in 1924 in the Mond Bequest.Davies, 109 Condition The four panels have rather different appearances, which in the past has led some scholars to suggest different authorship. But the differences arise from different treatment, cleaning and restoration, showing the effect different approaches can have. The two London panels are in the best condition, and have been cleaned and restored. The New York panel is in the poorest condition, having been cleaned too aggressively in the past, so that colours appear to have leached. Until 1946 the skeletons in the centre scene were hidden under over-painting. The Dresden panel is merely covered by thick yellowish varnish.Christiansen Notes References *Christiansen, Keith, Metropolitan Museum of Art catalogue entry, 2011, online (expand catalogue tab) *Davies, Martin, Catalogue of the Earlier Italian Schools, National Gallery Catalogues, 1961, reprinted 1986, *\\"Dresden\\", Dresden page (in German) *Lightbown, Ronald, Sandro Botticelli: Life and Work, 1989, Thames and Hudson Category:Botticelli paintings in the National Gallery, London Category:Paintings by Sandro Botticelli Category:Collections of the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art ","title":"Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius"},{"id":"54077828","text":"Ernst v Alberta Energy Regulator was a 2017 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with the extent to which damages are available as a remedy under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background This case pitted Jessica Ernst, an Alberta homeowner, against the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), who had ceased all forms of communication with her because her offhand remark in an electronic forum referred to Wiebo Ludwig had caused the regulator fear and anxiety over her purported terrorist sympathies. She claimed that her Charter rights to free speech had been abrogated by it, as it refused subsequently to hear her petitions in a dispute over her well- water, which she maintained had been polluted by the fracking activities of EnCana. In 2007, Ernst sued the Alberta government, EnCana Corporation and the ERCB, for alleged negligence over the contamination of local aquifers during a period of intense and shallow fracking of coal seams near her home in Rosebud, Alberta.ABQB, par. 4 It was reported that, between 2003 and 2008, more than 100 Alberta landowners lost or reported damage to their water wells as a result of such activity. During discussions with the ERCB as early as 2005, the Board identified her as a security threat, and refused any communication with her until she ceased criticizing its actions in public. As a result, she amended her statement of claim to include damages from the ERCB for violating her Charter rights under s. 2(b) thereof. The ERCB and the Province sought to have certain paragraphs of the claim struck off or, in the alternative, better particulars with respect to such paragraphs. The Board also sought a further alternative of having summary judgment granted in its favour.ABQB, par. 6-7 The courts below The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta ruled that:ABQB, part V (par. 131-133) #Ernst's claims against the ERCB in negligence were struck; #Ernst's Charter claim was valid, subject to the Limitations Act and the Energy Resources Conservation Act; but such claims were barred in any case under the latter Act; #Alberta's application was dismissed. The Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissed Ernst's appeal, declaring that the lower court's ruling \\"discloses no reviewable error.\\"ABCA, par. 30-31 At the Supreme Court By 5-4, the appeal was dismissed with costs, although for different reasons than were expressed by the Alberta courts. Cromwell J held that, as Ernst had not successfully challenged the constitutionality of the immunity clause protecting the ERCB, the appeal must fail. However, the constitutional challenge still needed to be considered on its merits:SCC, par. 20 #If an immunity provision clearly purports to bar a damages claim, and if the record before the Court is not adequate to permit a decision on its constitutionality, then the immunity clause must be applied.SCC, par. 23 #Charter damages could never be an appropriate and just remedy for such breaches by the Board, so the immunity clause cannot be unconstitutional.

Hugh \\"Hughey\\" O'Donnell (c. 1869-19??) was an American steel mill worker and labor leader. He is best remembered as the chairman of the Homestead Strike Advisory Committee during the Homestead Steel Strike of July 1892. Biography =Early years= Hugh O'Donnell came work at the Carnegie Steel Company works at Homestead, Pennsylvania in 1886, at the age of 17.O'Donnell testimony to the House Judiciary Committee, Investigation of the Employment of Pinkerton Detectives in Connection with the Labor Troubles at Homestead, PA. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1892; pp. 86-87. After 6 months in the sheet metal mill he moved to the Homestead works' mill which produced 119-inch steel plate, in which he worked as a heater. O'Donnell joined the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and was a member of that organization's Lodge No. 125. At the time of the Homestead labor dispute, O'Donnell was employed as a mill worker, and not as a professional trade union functionary. =Leadership of the Homestead strike= Drawing of O'Donnell from the front page of the Wilkes-Barre Evening News during the time of the strike. O'Donnell was named chairman of the Advisory Committee, the workers' organization in charge of coordination of the strike.Paul Krause, The Battle for Homestead, 1880-1892: Politics, Culture, and Steel. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1992; pg. 16. In this capacity he had cautioned against violence and trespassing upon company property in an attempt to keep the company from availing itself of judicial injunction or the seizing of the moral high ground.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pg. 17. The Advisory Committee established its headquarters on the third floor of the Bost Building, located at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Heisel Street in Homestead.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pg. 21. =Events of July 6= Union leaders made their headquarters on the third floor of the Bost Building in Homestead, now the site of a labor history museum. At 10:30 pm on July 5, 1892, some 300 employees of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency arrived by rail at Bellevue, about five miles south of Pittsburgh along the Ohio River.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pg. 15. These were put aboard two specially equipped barges, laden with 300 pistols and 250 Winchester rifles, and pulled by tugboat up the river to Homestead. Strike leaders, who assigned lookouts to keep a watch along rivers and rail routes, were apprised by telegram at 2:30 am of July 6 that barges had departed for the steel works and ten minutes later a warning alarm was sounded, echoed by whistles throughout the town. Chaos ensued and O'Donnell immediately lost control of the defense of the steelworks, which was spontaneously led by residents of Homestead. Armed strikers assembled at the steelworks and shots were fired at the tugboat pulling the barges, one of which shattered a window in the pilothouse. Some of those coming forward in impromptu leadership roles included Margaret Finch, the feisty widow of a steelworker who operated the Rolling Mill House saloon, English immigrant laborer William Foy, and open-hearth skilled worker Anthony Soulier.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pp. 16-17. As dawn began to break at 4:00 am, a crowd had gathered along the riverbank next to a barbed wire fence which ran from the plant to the river, which had been erected by the company some weeks earlier. The barges were pushed ashore at 4:30, to a cascade of angry shouts and a hail of stones, many of which were thrown by the hundreds of wives of strikers who had assembled.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pp. 17-18. Gangplanks were lowered and William Foy and Capt. Frederick H. Heinde, commander of the Pinkerton landing operation, tensely faced off amidst mutual threats.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pg. 19. A fracas erupted, with clubs wielded and shots were fired, with both Foy and Heinde hit by bullets. The Pinkertons began firing their rifles repeatedly into the crowd, with armed strikers answering in kind, and for the next ten minutes a pitched gun battle was waged; several strikers and two Pinkertons were mortally wounded, with dozens of others injured, including Hugh O'Donnell, who was grazed by a bullet to his thumb.Krause, The Battle for Homestead, pp. 19-20. The Pinkertons remained trapped aboard the barges, while O'Donnell and his associates of the Advisory Committee attempted to restore order to the tense and bloody situation, removing wives and wounded strikers from the scene and O'Donnell personally attempting, to the best of his ability, to calm and organize the crowd. =After the battle= On July 12, 1892, O'Donnell chaired a mass meeting in Homestead which voted unanimously to support the introduction into town of the National Guard, which had been called out by Pennsylvania Governor Robert E. Pattison.\\"Ready for the Troops,\\" Wilkes-Barre Evening News, July 12, 1892, pg. 1. The meeting was addressed by Homestead burgess (mayor) John McLuckie, who railed against the Pinkertons as members of a \\"dirty, filthy, stinking\\" organization while encouraging reception of the militia \\"with open arms,\\" since \\"they are not dangerous so long as the dignity of the state is not insulted.\\" =Legal difficulties= O'Donnell was arrested in September 1892, charged with conspiracy, aggravated riot, treason, and two counts of murder in connection with the violent battle between Homestead strikers and Pinkerton Detective Agency employees.\\"Hugh O'Donnell,\\" in Stuart B. Kaufman and Peter J. Albert (eds.), The Samuel Gompers Papers: Volume 3, Unrest and Depression, 1891-1894. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1989, pg. 211, fn. 5. He was held without bail on the charges, coming to trial on one of the murder charges in February 1893. O'Donnell was acquitted of the murder charge in a jury trial and was subsequently released on bail. Prosecutors never proceeded to bring O'Donnell to trial on any other offense, and all charges were eventually dropped. =Post-strike years= In the years after the failure of the Homestead strike, O'Donnell found himself blackballed from returning to work in the steel industry. Needing to adopt a new career, he moved to Philadelphia and took a job as a newspaper reporter.\\"Three Alleged Repeaters Held: Investigating Election Frauds in Philadelphia: Newspaper Men Testify,\\" York [PA] Daily, Nov. 17, 1899, pg. 1. In about 1903, O'Donnell accepted a position in government employment as a deputy to the Pennsylvania state factory inspector.\\"Factory Inspector Delaney,\\" Scranton Truth, Dec. 19, 1904, pg. 6. This job placed O'Donnell in crowded Pennsylvania tenements and poorly ventilated factories on a regular basis, and he subsequently contracted tuberculosis as a result.\\"Gets Consumption in Slum Work,\\" New York Tribune, Nov. 25, 1905, pg. 7. Stricken seriously ill by the disease, in November 1905 O'Donnell left the Northeast for the warmer and drier climate of the Southwest, accompanied by relatives, in an effort to regain his health. Newspaper accounts from December of that year place O'Donnell in the city of El Paso, Texas.\\"Strike Leader Here,\\" El Paso Herald, Dec. 16, 1905, pg. 2.

June originated from an area of convection that was first witnessed on August 15 in the Philippine Sea. Despite initial wind shear, the area intensified into a tropical storm three days later as it tracked westward. After tracking over Luzon, June entered the South China Sea on August 30\\\\. Despite remaining poorly organized, June re-intensified over land, and it was estimated to have briefly attained typhoon intensity before striking China, just to the east of Hong Kong, at maximum intensity, although its remnants were last noticed on September 3\\\\. Affecting the country four days before Typhoon Ike would devastate the Philippines, June brought widespread damage to the nation. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962 people sought shelter. A total of 671 homes were destroyed, with 6,341 others damaged. A total of 121 people were killed, while 17 other individuals were reportedly missing, and 26 other people were wounded. Damage totaled $24.2 million (1984 USD, including $15.24 million in agriculture and $8.82 million in infrastructure). Following June and Ike, several major countries provided cash and other goods. In all, $7.5 million worth of aid was donated to the nation in relief. In addition to effects on the Philippines, 1,500 homes were damaged and of farmland were flooded in the Guangdong province.  Meteorological history  Typhoon June, the final of seven tropical cyclones to develop in the Western Pacific basin in August 1984, formed from the monsoon trough. A large area of convection was first detected on satellite imagery, and at midday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center determined that a closed area of low pressure developed between the 135th meridian east and the 140th meridian east. The associated thunderstorm activity initially failed to consolidate due to strong wind shear caused by a displaced anticyclone. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to track the system 06:00 UTC on August 26. The next day, the wind shear began to relent, as an upper-level anticyclone became located over the system as the system tracked westward, although the circulation remained tough to identify by weather satellites. At 06:51 UTC on August 27, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of . Based on the above data and an increase in the system's organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On August 28, the storm's center of circulation became better defined, and at 06:00 UTC, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name Maring. Continuing westward due to a subtropical ridge to its north, June slowly intensified. On the afternoon of August 28, June made landfall along the coast of Luzon as a strong tropical storm, with the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of and respectively. Over land, the low- and mid-level circulations began to decouple, with the mid-level center and most of the deep convection continuing west and the low-level center veering west-northwest and early on August 29, the surface center re-merged into open water, having weakened slightly according to both the JTWC and the JMA. June began to turn northwest in response to a trough over the East China Sea. At 18:00 UTC on August 29, the JMA classified June as a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC reported that June attained its peak intensity of . Despite lacking in organization, a surface pressure of was measured in Basco as the cyclone passed near the area. The JMA declared June a typhoon at midday on August 30\\\\. At this time, it also estimated a peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Five hours later, June made landfall east of Hong Kong while at peak intensity. The JMA continued to follow the system inland throughout September 3.  Impact  Typhoon June hit the Philippines four days before Typhoon Ike would devastate the archipelago. The first storm to hit the Philippines in 1984, June brought rough seas from Luzon to Davao. Philippine Airlines suspended flights to eight cities and railway services to the northern portions of the island chain were also suspended. Power was knocked out for four days across much of the country due to both systems. Six people were killed in landslides that isolated the mountain resort city of Baguio, where five others were missing and seven were injured. According to the Philippine News Agency, a 22-year-old man picking seashells drowned after he was swept out to sea near Bacolod, on Negros Island. In San Fernando, located in the northern province of La Union, 200 houses were flattened and 120 people were injured. In Manila, heavy winds and rough seas left streets flooded, resulting in traffic jams. The storm caused serious damage to the nation's rice fields, the country's main export. From the two storms combined, more than 1 million were displaced from their homes. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962 people or 92,271 families sought shelter due to the typhoon, of which 5,023 families or 30,138 people sought shelter in schools, churches and town halls in a total of 10 provinces. A total of 671 homes were destroyed while 6,341 others were damaged. One hundred-twenty-one people were killed while 17 other individuals were reportedly missing and 26 other people were wounded. The storm inflicted $24.2 million in damage, with $15.2 million in agriculture and $8.82 million in infrastructure. Prior to its second landfall, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued after June entered the South China Sea. The storm brought heavy rains and strong winds to the region. A minimum pressure of was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory early on August 30\\\\. Tate's Cairn recorded a peak wind speed of and a peak wind gust of . Cheung Chau observed of rain over a five-day period. Although damage in Hong Kong was minimal, heavy rains in eastern Guangdong inundated of farmland, and damage to 1,500 dwellings.  Aftermath  Due to effects from both Ike and June, President Ferdinand Marcos set aside $4 million for relief work but initially refused any international aid. He also traveled to Ilocos Norte to inspect damage. The Philippines Air Force delivered of food, medicine, and clothes. According to officials, 92 health teams backed by 17 army medical units were fielded; these teams distributed $1.66 million worth of medicine. The Philippine Red Cross disturbed food to 239,331 people, or 44,247 families. On September 8, the nation abandoned its policy of refusing foreign aid, citing a lack of resources in the country due to its poor economy, as well as, the mass destruction across the country from both systems. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave an emergency grant of $50,000. UNICEF provided $116,000 worth of vitamins and medicine and an additional $116,950 in cash, as well as of milk powder. Thy later provided vegetable seeds, died fish, and garden fertilizer. The World Health Organization provided $7,000 worth of aid. Furthermore, the United Nations Development Programme awarded the country $30,000 in cash. The European Economic Community provided of milk and $367,650 worth of cash. In the middle of September, the United States approved $1 million in aid to the archipelago. Japan also sent a $500,000 check. Australia awarded almost $500,000 worth of cash and food. New Zealand donated of skin milk. The Norwegian Red Cross provided $58,500 in aid while Belgium also provided three medical kits. The Swiss Red Cross awarded a little under $21,000 in cash. German provided slightly more than $50,000 in cash. France provided roughly $11,000 in donations to the nation's red cross. The Red Cross Society of China donated $20,000 in cash. Indonesia provided $25,000 worth of medicine. The United Kingdom granted $74,441 in aid. Overall, Relief Web reported that over $7.5 million was donated to the Philippines due to the storm.

Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012‚Äì2018.  Early life and education  Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Broadmoor neighborhood work  Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood. Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.  Political career  = New Orleans City Council = In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014. As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal- justice issues. She introduced a bill banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015. Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city. As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at the New Orleans Police Department. = 2017 mayoral election = Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace term- limited mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the most votes, winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New Orleans in its 300-year history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro. = Mayor of New Orleans = Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufactures and distributors. = Awards = In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier universities and the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.  Personal life  Cantrell lives with her husband Jason and daughter RayAnn in Broadmoor, New Orleans.

Schenkenschans was garrisoned largely by English troops and was besieged by a Spanish force led by Francisco de Mendoza. The siege failed with losses and the Spanish were forced to retreat when a relief force arrived.Markham pp. 275‚Äì76 Background In 1586, Maartin Schenck and Roger Williams had been campaigning in the County of Westphalia raiding as far as Kaiserswerth. In Gelderland a sconce, called Schenckenschanz, or Schenck's Fortification, was built at the confluence of the Waal and the Rhine. (Dutch) Maurice of Orange strengthened the sconce later on; earthworks were built which formed two bastions. Bridges were built over the moats and a continuous series of posts where signals could be relayed. From this important strategic location, the sconce would inevitably be subjected to attack. By 1599, Maurice's army was stationed along the line of rivers ready to defend Schenckenschans, Nijmegen, and Doesburg. Schenckenschans itself composed of eight hundred troops and one hundred pioneers, almost all of them Englishmen who had served under Francis Vere (who was away in the Hague). Francisco de Mendoza, the Admiral of Aragon, was stationed in Gelderland and was ordered by the Archduke of Austria to capture Schenkenschans‚Äîto the Spanish called \\"The Key to the islands\\". Once won, the Spanish would then be able to cut Holland off. On 17 April the Archduke left a section of troops to cover the Rhine and two days later Mendoza's force marched to Schenkenschans. Siege On 28 April the armies of Mendoza and Frederik van den Bergh met at Griethausen around Kleve. The combined force totalled some 19,0000 men including 2,000 cavalry. They then bridged over the Rhine and used boats between Rees and Emmerich and from there managed to drive the Dutch ships downstream. The Spanish set up batteries from the two banks‚Äîone bank held nine pieces of artillery whilst the other had twelve. These then opened fire on the fort but in response however the fort replied with vigour and an artillery duel began following which some exposed Spanish guns were knocked out. Mendoza was unable to create any damage on the English defences and set up a formal siege instead. Being heavily outnumbered the garrison of Schenkenschans was in need of relief. On the night of 1 May a Dutch force under Walloon Colonel Claude La Barlotte landed with an army of five thousand men upstream of the Mass in secrecy. He disembarked at Hedel in the Bommelerwaard and when news of this approach was heard by Mendoza he thought it better to break off the siege and engage the force.Duelroo p. 108 The English inside the sconce were relieved two days later by a cavalry force of 800 that Maurice had sent ahead. La Barlotte's force escaped to the north to Zaltbommel with Mendoza's force in pursuit. Aftermath Present day Schenkenschanz in Germany On 11 May Mendoza, with a new plan, took the fort at Crevecoeur by surprise and planned to use it as a base for an offensive. Maurice however was already aware of these plans and had hoped that they had to try to launch an attack against Schenkenschans again and therefore entrenched there.Markham pp. 275‚Äì76 When it became clear to him that Mendoza's target was actually Zaltbommel he marched his men straight there. Under the small force of La Barlotte, Zaltbommel would not be able to stand against Mendoza's more numerous force. The Spanish attempt however to lay siege to Zaltbommel ended in disaster too. Schenkenschans remained firmly in States hands until 1630 when by betrayal, money was offered to one of the commanders in the sconce and was then handed over to the Spanish. During the siege of 1635‚Äì1636 the Dutch would overpower the sconce, with the majority of the garrison being killed and the fort being looted.Israel pp. 73‚Äì76  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography  * Schenckenschans (1599) Schenckenschans Schenckenschans Schenckenschans Category:1599 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1599 ","title":"Siege of Schenckenschans (1599)"},{"id":"54077957","text":"Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Morgan Golden is an American applied mathematician and Distinguished Professor at the University of Utah.

During his senior year in football, he led his team to the Class 7A state title game, and passed for 3,173 yards and 38 touchdowns. He originally committed to Auburn University to play college baseball, but changed his commitment to the University of Alabama in February 2017. A three-star football recruit, he also received offers to play college football from the University of Tennessee and the University of Mississippi. Thompson was considered one of the top prospects for the 2017 Major League Baseball draft. He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the first round of the draft. Thompson officially signed with the Rangers a few days after the draft and was assigned to the AZL Rangers, where he spent the whole season, posting a .257 batting average with three home runs and 12 RBIs in thirty games. He spent 2018 with the Hickory Crawdads of the Class A South Atlantic League, where he slashed .289/.344/.446 with eight home runs, 42 RBIs, and 32 stolen bases.

He conducted the staff band at WKRC and had several weekly radio shows. Morgan got his start in show business by playing on the boats that travel up and down the Ohio River near his home-town of Cincinnati. Morgan also bought his own night spot in Cincinnati, the Club Carasal.Liner notes, Al Morgan at the Dunes, LP, Coral Records, 1959 While working at the Club Carasal, Morgan decided that he would join the entertainment. He became so popular, he decided that he should go on the road. The Al Morgan Show In November 1946, he gave up his radio job, sold the Club Carasal, and headed for New York. He did a long stretch at Rogers Corner Theater Lounge, a spot across the street from Madison Square Garden. Then he traveled to Chicago. He was booked in Chicago at Helsing's Vodvil Lounge at Sheridan and Montrose on the city's north side. The manager booked him, sight-unseen, thinking he was a comedian. He didn't laugh, however, when Morgan sat down at the piano and started playing. That led to The Al Morgan Show, Morgan's half-hour television show, backed by the Billy Chandler Trio, broadcasting from Helsing's. The show was on the DuMonte Television Network, from 1949 to 1951; one of the first shows to be syndicated. In 1952, Morgan was back in Cincinnati, broadcasting his show from WLW Television. While playing in Wisconsin Morgan had the idea to make a big band arrangement of the Jenny Lou Carson song, \\"Jealous Heart\\". Rumor has it that Morgan first sang \\"Jealous Heart\\" as a part of a medley in his act. That song, recorded in Chicago and released on Universal in 1949, became a local hit. Decca Records in England was starting a new label called London Records and deal was struck to release \\"Jealous Heart\\" on London. Jealous Heart \\"Jealous Heart\\" (a cover of the Jenny Lou Carson country song) was released in 1949 and was his biggest hit, said to have sold in excess of 12 million copies. Morgan performed at various theaters, churches, supper clubs and Las VegasWalter Winchell, Lakeland Ledger, June 12, 1958, \\"‚Ä¶signed a long-termer at the Dunes\\" concert halls for over 40 years, and continued to perform until his death in 1989. He was one of the first musicians to have his own syndicated television show. He is best known for his flamboyant style of piano playing where he would raise his hands over his shoulders and flop them down on the keys, hitting all the correct notes, earning him the title, \\"Flying Fingers.\\" Late career Morgan continued to record for the length of his career. Morgan recorded over 50 songs for London Records and recorded for most of the major labels including Columbia, Mercury, Decca and RCA subsidiary \\"X\\". Morgan's recordings for London were pressed internationally including England, Canada, Germany, Australia and South Africa. Later in his career Morgan recorded for smaller independent labels such as Crystal, and Jewel. In 1961 he had a nightly live radio show performing from 11:30 pm to 12, on WTAQ, broadcasting from LaGrange, Illinois. Death In 1989, Morgan performed at the Olympic Theater in Cicero, Illinois for his video, In Concert at the Olympic Theater on Memorial Day, May 28, 1989. The show ended with 3 songs all containing the word \\"jealous\\" and ending with \\"Jealous Heart.\\" This could have been the medley that started his career, and the last recording that Morgan made. Morgan was performing at Noodles Restaurant when he died on Saturday, November 18, 1989 in Loyola's McGaw Hospital in Maywood, Illinois.George Papajohn, Chicago Tribune, obituary November 21, 1989 He was survived by his wife Janice, 7 sons and a daughter Michelle. Personal life While on tour in New York's Rogers' Corner, he met and later married the cashier. His third wife Janice was also a singer and musician who would perform with Morgan on stage. Janice recorded under her maiden name, Jan Nixon and later Jan Morgan. On her album, That's Why I Smile she sings 4 duets with her husband Al.

He represented Spain at the 1875 Conference of the Metre Convention and was the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. As a forerunner geodesist and president of the International Geodetic Association, he played a leading role in the worldwide dissemination of the metric system. His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all States parties to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. These prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960. He was born in Barcelona. According to Spanish tradition, his surname was a combination of his father's first surname, Mart√≠n Ib√°√±ez y de Prado and of his mother's first surname, Carmen Ib√°√±ez de Ibero y Gonz√°lez del R√≠o. As his parent's surnames were so similar he was often referred as Ib√°√±ez or Ib√°√±ez de Ibero or as Marquis of Mulhac√©n. When he died in Nice (France), he was still enrolled in the Engineer Corps of the Spanish Army. As he died around midnight, the date of his death is ambiguous, Spaniards retained 28th, and continental Europeans 29 January.  Scientific career  = From the Map Commission to the Geographic and Statistical Institute in Spain = Spain adopted the metric system in 1849. The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Ib√°√±ez was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Ib√°√±ez and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Jean Brunner of a measuring instrument calibrated against the metre which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N¬∞1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres. In 1858 Spain's central geodetic base of triangulation was measured in Madridejos (Toledo) with exceptional precision for the time thanks to this instrument, which became known as the Spanish Standard (French: R√®gle espagnole). Ib√°√±ez and his colleagues wrote a monograph which was translated into French by Aim√© Laussedat. The experiment, in which the results of two methods were compared, ended a controversy between French and German geodesists about the length of geodesic triangulation bases, and empirically validated the method of General Johann Jacob Bayer, founder of the International Association of Geodesy. The Spanish Standard was replicated in order to be used in Egypt. In 1863, Ib√°√±ez and Ismail Effendi Mustafa compared the Spanish Standard with the Egyptian Standard in Madrid. From 1865 to 1868 Ib√°√±ez added the survey of the Balearic Islands with that of the Iberian Peninsula. For this work, he devised a new instrument, which allowed much faster measurements. In 1869, Ib√°√±ez brought it along to Southampton where Alexander Ross Clarke was making the necessary measurements to compare the Standards of length used in the World. Finally, this second version of the appliance, called the Ib√°√±ez apparatus, was used in Switzerland to measure the geodetic bases of Aarberg, Weinfelden and Bellinzona.A. Hirsch et J. Dumur, Lausanne, Commission G√©od√©sique Suisse, 1888, 116 p. In 1870 Ib√°√±ez founded the Spanish National Geographic Institute which he then directed until 1889. At the time it was the world's biggest geographic institute. It encompassed geodesy, general topography, leveling, cartography, statistics and the general service of weights and measures. = Measurement of the Paris meridian over the Mediterranean Sea = left Copies of the Spanish standard were also made for France and Germany. These standards would be used for the most important operations of European geodesy. Indeed, Louis Puissant had declared in 1836 to the French Academy of Sciences that Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre M√©chain had committed an error in the measurement of the Paris meridian arc, which had served for determining the length of the metre. As this survey was also part of the groundwork for the map of France, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodetic operations at eight points of the meridian arc from 1861 to 1866. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M√©chain were then corrected. In 1865 the triangulation of Spain was connected with that of Portugal and France. In 1866 at the conference of the Association of Geodesy in Neuch√¢tel, Ib√°√±ez announced that Spain would collaborate in remeasuring and extending French meridian arc. From 1870 to 1894, Fran√ßois Perrier, then Jean-Antonin-L√©on Bassot proceeded to a new survey. In 1879 Ib√°√±ez and Fran√ßois Perrier completed the junction between the geodetic networks of Spain and Algeria and thus completed the measurement of a meridian arc which extended from Shetland to the Sahara. This connection was a remarkable enterprise where triangles with a maximum length of 270 km were observed from mountain stations (Mulhac√©n, Tetica, Filahoussen, M'Sabiha) over the Mediterranean Sea. This meridian arc was named West Europe- Africa Meridian-arc by Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert. It yielded a value for the equatorial radius of the earth a = 6 377 935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15. The radius of curvature of this arc is not uniform, being, in the mean, about 600 metres greater in the northern than in the southern part. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the International Geodetic Association, the net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the meridian of Greenwich is nearer the mean than that of Paris. = International scientific collaboration in geodesy and calls for an international standard unit of length = National Prototype Meter Bar No. 27, made in 1889 by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and given to the United States, which served as the standard for defining all units of length in the US from 1893 to 1960. After the Treaty of the Meter had been signed in 1875, the BIPM in S√®vres, France made 30 prototype standard bars of 90% platinum‚Äì10% iridium alloy. One of the bars was selected as the International Meter. After selecting the bar to be used as the International Prototype Meter, the other bars were calibrated relative to it and given to nations to serve as their national standards. In 1866 Spain, represented by Ib√°√±ez, joined the Central European Arc Measurement (German: Mitteleurop√§ische Gradmessung) at the Permanent Commission meeting in Neuch√¢tel. In 1867 at the second General Conference of the Central European Arc Measurement (see International Association of Geodesy) held in Berlin, the question of an international standard unit of length was discussed in order to combine the measurements made in different countries to determine the size and shape of the Earth. The Conference recommended the adoption of the metre and the creation of an international metre commission, according to a preliminary discussion between Johann Jacob Baeyer, Adolphe Hirsch and Carlos Ib√°√±ez e Ib√°√±ez de Ibero. The French Academy of Sciences and the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris drew the attention of the French government to this issue. The Academy of St Petersburg and the English Standards Commission were in agreement with the recommendation. In November 1869 the French government issued invitations to join this commission. Spain accepted and Ib√°√±ez took part in the Committee of preparatory research from the first meeting of the International Metre Commission in 1870. He was elected president of the Permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission in 1872. He represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the Metre Convention and at the first General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. At the first meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures, he was elected Chairman of the Committee, a position he held from 1875 to 1891. He received the L√©gion d'Honneur in recognition of his efforts to disseminate the metric system among all nations and was awarded the Poncelet Prize for his scientific contribution to metrology.Gravimeter with variant of Repsold-Bessel pendulum.President of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement from 1874 to 1886, Ib√°√±ez became the first president of the International Geodetic Association (1887-1891) after the death of Johann Jacob Baeyer. As Carlos Ib√°√±ez e Ib√°√±ez de Ibero stated, the International prototype metre would form the basis of the new international system of units, but it would no longer have any relation to the dimensions of the Earth that geodesists were trying to determine. It would be no more than the material representation of the unity of the system. The European Arc Measurment decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Conference of the International Association of Geodesy also dealt with the best instrument to be used for the determination of gravity. After an in-depth discussion in which an American scholar, Charles Sanders Peirce, took part, the association decided in favor of the reversion pendulum, which was used in Switzerland, and it was resolved to redo in Berlin, in the station where Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel made his famous measurements, the determination of gravity by means of apparatus of various kinds employed in different countries, in order to compare them and thus to have the equation of their scales. The progresses of metrology combined with those of gravimetry through improvement of Kater's pendulum led to a new era of geodesy. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, it could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the pendulum, if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the rulers for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimeter would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the measurement of the Globe. In 1889 the General Conference on Weights and Measures met at S√®vres, the seat of the International Bureau. It performed the first great deed dictated by the motto inscribed in the pediment of the splendid edifice that is the metric system: \\"A tous les temps, a tous les peuples\\" (For all times, to all peoples); and this deed consisted in the approval and distribution, among the governments of the states supporting the Metre Convention, of prototype standards of hitherto unknown precision intended to propagate the metric unit throughout the whole world. These prototypes were made of a platinum-iridium alloy which combined all the qualities of hardness, permanence, and resistance to chemical agents which rendered it suitable for making into standards required to last for centuries. Yet their high price excluded them from the ordinary field of science. For metrology the matter of expansibility was fundamental; as a matter of fact the temperature measuring error related to the length measurement in proportion to the expansibility of the standard and the constantly renewed efforts of metrologists to protect their measuring instruments against the interfering influence of temperature revealed clearly the importance they attached to the expansion-induced errors. It was common knowledge, for instance, that effective measurements were possible only inside a building, the rooms of which were well protected against the changes in outside temperature, and the very presence of the observer created an interference against which it was often necessary to take strict precautions. Thus, the Contracting States also received a collection of thermometers which accuracy made it possible to ensure that of length measurements.

The adults and larvae burrow under the bark of mature oak trees. It is native to Europe. Description The adult oak pinhole borer is between long, being cylindrical In cross section (hence cylindrus) and, seen from above, shaped like a long, narrow rectangle. Its colour is very deep brown to black. The larvae are yellowish-white, legless grubs. Distribution The oak pinhole beetle is native to Europe. It used to be considered rare in Britain, but after the Great Storm of 1987, when many trees were blown down in southern England, it took advantage of the abundant supply of timber and became much more common. Ecology The oak pinhole borer infests mature trees, favouring stressed, dying or dead standing trees, fallen trees and logs; the insects choose a sick or moribund tree, but their activities do not kill trees. Besides oak trees, they can infest other hardwood trees, including beech, sweet chestnut, ash, elm and walnut. The adults can mature at any time of year but are at their most active from July to September. At this time of year, the male excavates a hole a few centimetres deep. The female goes inside and then emerges, with mating taking place on the surface of the bark. The female then re-enters the hole and the male follows. The female extends the tunnel further, working radially, and the male pushes the wood fragments out, leaving a pile of frass. This residue is fine and soft which distinguishes it from the more granular, coarser material produced by most wood-boring beetles. The walls of the gallery soon become covered with a layer of ambrosia fungi, spores having been introduced on the body surface of the beetles. This symbiotic fungus is only found in the galleries made by ambrosia beetles and provides them and their larvae with nourishment; they do not feed on the wood. After about four weeks of tunnelling, the female lays a batch of eggs, and lays further batches at irregular intervals during her two or three year lifespan. She also continues tunnelling, and the branching galleries may extend for as much as . The eggs hatch after two to six weeks. The larvae pass through four or five instar stages and feed on the ambrosia fungus. The later instars have powerful jaws and extend the tunnel system further, although they tunnel more slowly than the female; the frass they produce is coarser than that produced by adults. The larval stage lasts for about two years, then the larvae create small chambers in which they pupate, later emerging into the open air as adults without doing any more tunnelling. Several generations of beetle may occupy one tunnel system. Damage The tunnels made by the oak pinhole borer are about in diameter and do not weaken the timber to any great extent. However, they do spoil the appearance of veneers, and the ambrosia fungus produces black staining. The beetles and larvae continue their tunnelling activities in stacked timber, and although at first they only burrow through the sapwood, later they move on to the heartwood. Insecticides have no effect on adults and larvae inside their tunnels, but kiln drying of the timber can kill them when the fungus is unable to survive the desiccation.

The documentary follows the lives of Korean-American hip-hop artists Dumbfounddead, Awkwafina, Rekstizzy, and Lyricks, and their struggle to garner credibility in the American hip-hop industry. Bad Rap premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 13, 2016, and has since been screened at twelve other film festivals around the world. As of September 7, 2017, the film has been made available on the iTunes Store, Amazon, VUDU, Google Play, and Netflix.  Synopsis  Bad Rap features the stories of four prominent Asian-American hip- hop figures, all at different points in their careers, but sharing the same goal of succeeding in the mainstream. It traces through the early days of freestyle battle aficionado Jonathan Park, better known as \\"Dumbfoundead\\", and his personal struggle with marketability in the modern hip-hop industry. The film also focuses on how developing artists such as New Yorker David \\"Rekstizzy\\" Lee and Richard \\"Lyricks\\" Lee carve out their niche within the genre, placing a focus on creative expression and artistic identity. Rising star Nora \\"Awkwafina\\" Lum discusses her relationship with her race and career, and her perceived responsibilities as a double-minority in the genre. The film places a great emphasis on the question of authenticity in hip-hop and what the role of aspiring artists in the genre should be, using the stories of pioneers such as MC Jin to explore the question on a wide spectrum. Bad Rap chooses not to focus on the boundaries set by the artists' heritage, but the struggle of working to fit into a niche community that rejects them for more than just where they come from. Quoting director Koroma, ‚ÄúThe themes we explore of fighting to belong in a particular community, of having your parents and friends tell you differently but nonetheless following your passion‚Äîthose are universal.‚Äù  Cast  * Jonathan Park (Dumbfoundead) as himself * Nora Lum (Awkwafina) as herself * David Lee (Rekstizzy) as himself * Richard Lee (Lyricks) as himself The documentary also features special appearances by MC Jin, Shogunna, Traphik, Jay Park, Kero One, The Fung Brothers, Far East Movement, Ted Chung, Danny Chung, Oliver Wang, Ebro Darden, Damien Scott, Riggs Morales, and Jonathan Briks.

The music is complex and unpredictable at times but the direct emotional rawness of the most acid-tongued bluesmen is intact and very plainly laid bare like a dumped corpse on a dirt road. It‚Äôs hushed and thin but can fill the biggest space with claustrophobic dread in no time.\\" The blues influence is also noted by Brain Howe of Pitchfork: \\"The Narcotic Story fully embraces a sort of slow-burning, infernal blues. It's a malign transmission, sparser than Oxbow's more metallic styles, and, paradoxically, much heavier.\\" The \\"musical subtleties\\" of the album were highlighted by a Drowned in Sound critic: \\"Strings spill, weeping barroom pianos plink dolefully and the noise of Neurosis tuning up in Hell with razor-wire for plectrums is succeeded by a band becoming comfortable in their own skins; cohesive, essential, even accessible.\\" The lyrics tell the story of a character named Frank Johnson, \\"a downtrodden gent [...] lurching through the self-degrading shadows of life.\\" Morgan described it as \\"a record of addiction and withdrawal, [...] it tells a decidedly unglamorous story of narcotics and whatever else Robinson‚Äôs characters go through.\\" The album was initially conceived as the first part of a triptych with plans for a filmed adaptation. However in 2017, the band stated that they had \\"over-promise[d]\\" and that the person who had been \\"filming some of the stuff\\" (who had also inspired \\"large portions\\" of the album) \\"just disappeared with the film.\\"  Release  The album was released through Hydra Head Records on CD and through Black Diamond on LP the following year.  Reception  The album received highly positive reviews from many publications. Drowned in Sound considered it to be \\"2007's greatest LP\\". Scene Point Blank wrote that the album marked \\"another notch on the bedpost of the cash-burning, international horrorshow that is Oxbow, another chapter in one of modern music's most deranged and cathartic sagas.\\" Aaron Turner (founder of Hydra Head Records and Isis front man) included the album among his \\"picks\\" and called it \\"a lesson in brutality, restraint, beauty and menace of endless suspense doled out in equal but unpredictable measure. While musical artists of all stripes regularly feign emotional energy through the mode of song craft, there are a slim few who have so purely channeled the human experience so tenderly and so forcefully as Oxbow have on The Narcotic Story.\\" =Awards= Producer Joe Chiccarelli was nominated for a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for his work on The Narcotic Story alongside three other albums in 2008. =Accolades= Rock-A- Rolla magazine named it the best album of the year.

Released in 2002 through Neurot Recordings, it was their first album in 5 years (the last one being Serenade in Red). The album is notable for the inclusion of \\"Shine (Glimmer)\\" which, at over 30 minutes in length, is the longest track in their discography. Content Lyricist/vocalist Eugene S. Robinson has described the album as \\"a meditation on sex and power\\" (in comparison to Serenade in Red which he described as \\"a meditation on love\\"). Dave Pehling of SF Weekly called the album \\"a fever dream of sexual compulsion, pulverizing riffs, and droning feedback. Grappling with religious iconography and base desires, Robinson sings of a personal trinity (\\"the drunk, the reprobate, and the Holy Ghost\\") and then resolves to move beyond guilt: \\"Sorry ain't something I ever going to be sorry over/ It slows the sinning/ What with all that knee-bending.\\"\\" He described the track \\"Shine (Glimmer)\\" as an \\"epic, near-psychedelic tune [...] Over half an hour long, the instrumental tour de force balances a pounding, Melvins-esque groove with a soothing wall of layered guitar-noise.

Release The album was initially issued in a Digipak with a clear tray and an 8-page booklet containing lyrics. In 2016, it was reissued in the US and Canada through the label Concrete Lo Fi Records as a double LP in two different editions: a translucent gold edition and a 180g vinyl edition. Reception Allmusic wrote that \\"for a band who on paper might appear past their prime, it's a surprisingly good album. Actually, it's just really good, period. Compared to earlier albums like Fuckfest or King of the Jews, this album is much stronger in terms of how well the band uses dynamics and in how well the songs flow together. As a result, it stands up much better as a unified whole than those earlier releases.\\" \\"In times past, Oxbow sounded somewhat like labelmates Neurosis, or a spoiled Birthday Party\\" writes Pitchfork, \\"An Evil Heat cools the fire just enough for a slower burn.\\" They end by writing that the album \\"may not be for everyone, but you're going to keep an open ear-- it's been too long since you've listened to anything this hard.\\" Exclaim! writes that the album sounds \\"incredibly calculated, making this bunch worthy of suspicion and wariness, which is the trait of any true artist.\\" SF Weekly found it to be \\"a continuation of the band's exploration of the heart's dank tributaries.\\" Asked by Noisey to rank their own records, both Robinson and Wenner considered it to be their 3rd best. =Accolades= Terrorizer found it to be the 37th best album of the year.

It has originally been assigned to the order Pyrotheria and the family Colombitheriidae, although a later detailed analysis of the fossil questions that classification. A fossil jawbone of approximately length of Colombitherium has been found by Texas Petroleum in 1945, in the Upper Eocene strata of the middle Gualanday Group in the department of Tolima, Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes.  Etymology  The genus Colombitherium means \\"Beast from Colombia\\". The species epithet tolimense refers to the department of Tolima, where the type species has been found.Billet et al., 2010, p.319Basic information about Colombitherium  Description  The genus is only known from a single jawbone with some teeth, found by Texas Petroleum in 1945, a specimen approximately in length, recovered from the Late Eocene middle part of the Gualanday Group on the San Pedro finca, Alto San Jos√©, Chaparral, Tolima. The teeth, molars and premolars of a kind known as bilophodont, which are present in the pyrotheres - were considered as evidence that this genus could be an ancestor of the advanced pyrotheres as Pyrotherium.Hoffstetter, 1971, p.39 Colombitherium has first been described by Hoffstetter in 1970, with a revised interpretation published by Billet et al. in 2010.Billet et al., 2010, p.320 The detailed descriptions by Billet et al. show the differences between Colombitherium and other pyrotherians: the features of the bilophodont teeth of Colombitherium are actually found in several groups of placental mammals, which implies that Colombitherium and another possibly related taxon, Proticia could not be part of Pyrotheria. The authors maintain \\"the referral of Colombitherium to Pyrotheria is therefore weakly supported, and it must be considered as highly hypothetical.\\"Billet et al., 2010, p.323 In any case, the lack of further evidence means that Colombitherium and Proticia must be classified in a separate family, Colombitheriidae which is tentatively classified as a primitive clade in Pyrotheria. Also the absolute age of the strata where the fossil jawbone has been found is questioned. The age has been originally defined by De Porta in 1962 on the basis of the pollen Verrucatosporites usmensis and Cicatricosisporites sp. The last occurrence of Echitriporites trianguliformis orbicularis indicates a Late Eocene to Early Oligocene age for the upper layers of the Gualanday Group.Billet et al., 2010, p.324  See also  * Pyrotherium, a similar mammal from the Late Oligocene of Argentina and Bolivia  References  = Bibliography = * *  External links  * Colombitherium tolimense - Paleontolog√≠a en Colombia Category:Meridiungulata Category:Eocene mammals of South America Category:Paleogene Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1970 Category:Taxa named by Robert Hoffstetter ","title":"Colombitherium"},{"id":"54078483","text":"Mining Review titles, 1954.

It is the second longest tunnel in Ukraine. It is a part of the fifth pan- European transit corridor (Italy-Slovenia-Hungary-Slovakia-Ukraine). The first Beskidy Tunnel, built in 1886, was and was located on an alignment between train stations at Beskid and Skotarske. Over time, the capacity of this tunnel had become inadequate in the face of increasing demand, thus, a decision was made to pursue the construction of a new bore running parallel to the existing tunnel. In 1998 discussions started about its construction but building started in 2014. The new tunnel has a length of 1,822 meters and is covered by up to 180 meters of rock. The internal dimensions of 8.5 meters height and 10.5 meters width allows for a double track railway to be accommodated. The maximum speed was also increased from 40 km/h to 70 km/h. As a result, the tunnel can now handle daily traffic of 50 to 100 trains. The two tubes are connected by three lugs, while the old tunnel is being used as a rescue route for the new one. During late May 2018, the tunnel was inaugurated in a ceremony. New tunnel The new Beskidy tunnel passes through the mountains between the towns of Beskid and Skotarske and connects the Ukrainian rail network with Europe's Corridor V, thus linking the city of Lviv in western Ukraine to cities such as Venice and Trieste in northern Italy, as well as various other locations along the route in Slovenia and Hungary. The new tunnel is expected to handle nearly 60 per cent of all rail traffic travelling between Ukraine and the European Union.\\"Ukraine launches Beskyd railway tunnel.\\" railway-technology.com, 25 May 2018. Postage stamp of Ukraine, 2018 The project was financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB); the EBRD invested $40 million, while the EIB contributed ‚Ç¨55 million ($64.5 million) to pay for the construction effort. The EBRD director for Ukraine Sevki Acuner stated of the project: ‚ÄúThe new tunnel is a positive example of the contemporary relationship between Ukraine and Europe. It will unblock the worst bottleneck in the east-west transport corridor. More importantly, it symbolises Ukraine‚Äôs aspiration to be integrated into the EU economy and to become part of the 21st-century European family‚Äù. In addition to providing financing, technical expertise was also bought in from the EU, especially from Austria, to support the development of the tunnel.

To raise funds and awareness of the ministry he completed three walks across the United States and was on his fourth walk when he died. He was also on the board of trustees for Southwestern Baptist Seminary, wrote for the Baptist Press, and ran for statewide leadership roles in the church in North Carolina. Early life and career Stone was born in North Carolina to Coy F. and Sudie \\"Oleta\\" (West) Stone and had two younger brothers, Dwight and Donnie. He graduated from Durham High School before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from Wake Forest University in 1956. While at Wake Forest, he lettered as a member of the cross-country team, was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity, won the J.B. Currin public speaking award, and was the pastor of Bell's Baptist Church. While at Bell's, he organized homeowners whose property was threatened by the proposed Jordan Lake. He went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from North Carolina Central University where he wrote a two hundred page paper on the history of Durham politics for his thesis. He also studied at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary and Duke University graduate school. He married Ann Fuller on Aug. 31, 1956 in Durham County, North Carolina. They would have three daughters: Ellen, Carole, and Lisa. Stone became the associate pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Durham from 1959 to 1962. He also looked for activities outside of the ministry. He published a newspaper called Chatham Life and tried his hand at real estate, insurance, putt-putt golf, and as a florist. Addiction Stone first became addicted to drugs while he was a minister in 1970. A friend gave him two amphetamine pills to help \\"make him more efficient at his job\\". The two pills quickly became a fifteen pill a day habit. His personality distorted, he left his church and was soon arrested on drug charges. He said he became a \\"criminal monster\\" and robbed at least four convenience stores. At the last robbery, in 1971, he shot a clerk. He was eventually caught and charged with attempted murder. He would be paroled after spending four and a half years in prison. While in prison he received psychiatric treatment from Duke University Hospital. During that time he \\"gave his life back to the Lord\\". When he was released, he promised to begin hand-delivering a message of hope to people fighting addictions. Ministry On his release from prison, Stone refused to sit by and hope someone else would share a religious experience with people who were addicts. He began preaching about his renewed faith and how it could help others. He began the Ted Stone Ministries then wrote the autobiography \\"Somebody Special\\" in 1984 in which he detailed his journey from drugs to prison to a passion for helping people. Stone's ministries did not go un-noticed. He met with former First Lady Betty Ford, and at least three governors: George W. Bush, Gary Johnson, and Fife Symington. He wrote The Drug Tragedy in 1987 which was a general survey of the drug problem in America and proposed solutions. With Philip Barber, he wrote Hope for the One Who Hurts and Hope for the One Who Cares, one to provide help for people with drug addictions and the other to give help to the addict's loved ones. In 2005 he created HIS Way Ministries as an effort to help addicts from falling back into the habits which got them addicted. HIS Way had three requirement: A church's staff and congregation must be committed to the success of the program; members of the congregation must be trained to be effective mentors and be willing to mentor for at least six months or longer; and recovering addicts must be serious about permanent recovery from their addictions. To qualify for the program, addicts had to complete a Christian treatment program and must have experienced a saving relationship with Jesus Christ. He continually pushed Southern Baptists, and Christians in general, to assist people with addictions. At the June 2006 meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in Greensboro, NC, he told missionary directors that \\"broken people\\" shouldn't be considered \\"second- class citizens in the family of God.\\" He believed that the Christian church held the answer to the drug abuse problem: \\"Most programs use something to substitute for the abuser's addiction. Some even refer to a higher power. But my message is that by putting your dependence on the Lord Jesus Christ, you can break your dependence on chemical substances.\\" He also said that Jesus is still in the miracle working business. Other work Stone was a two-term trustee of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary where he was heavily involved in establishing the Roy Fish School of Evangelism and Missions. He was a long-time member of the Board of Visitors at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, NC. He served as a member of the North Carolina Mental Health Commission for five years. Beginning in 2001, he and Barber co-wrote a regular column for Baptist Press, where he tried to keep the afflictions of America's addicts in front of his Southern Baptist audience. Walks across America Stone was known for walking across the country to help raise awareness for his miniseries. He tried to walk an average of 25 miles a day and he would drive up to 150 miles off his route to speak. Financing his first trip was tough. He had estimated that the trip would cost around $25,000 but the final total was approximately $32,000. Stone said, \\"I tried to earn my own way by speaking, sort of like Paul and his tent making. I was not sponsored for the trip. New Balance did furnish the shoes and I was grateful for reduced rates at some Holiday Inns.\\" On his first trip, in 1996, he walked 3,650-mile from the Capitol steps in Washington, D.C., south to Jacksonville, FL and westward to Los Angeles, CA. He spoke to almost 200 audiences along the way about the changes society must make in order to correct the problems caused by drug abuse. His second trip, in 1998, was a 3,550-mile trek from the mayor's office in San Francisco, CA east to Virginia Beach, VA. His third trip was in 2000. He walked 1,700-mile, south to north from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas in Mexico and ended in Detroit, MI at the Ambassador Bridge leading into Canada. He said, \\"The success of the walk cannot be measured in dollars. The whole purpose of the walk was to deliver a message of hope to hurting Americans and to make a mark for good in our country's battle against drug abuse.\\" He hoped to challenge churches to help others to overcome their addictions by having an open heart for broken people. Death Stone planned his fourth walk across the country to start in August, 2002. He planned to walk across the United States from east to west, starting in Atlantic Beach, NC. This trip was postponed after a diagnosis of colon cancer that year. He survived two surgeries and revised his plan to run from north to south. He started his trip in Chicago, IL on June 18, 2006 and planned to arrive in Pensacola, FL nine weeks and 1,100 miles later. In previous trips he had carried an American flag. On this trip he carried both an American flag and a Christian flag; one to celebrate his freedoms as an American and the other to celebrate his freedom from the bonds of addiction through God. During the trip he lost consciousness when riding in a car from the walking route to a speaking engagement in Gallatin, TN. He would not regain consciousness and died in at Skyline Medical Center in Nashville. The Davidson County medical examiner ruled that he died of cardiovascular disease. Awards and recognitions On March 11, 1997, US Senator Lauch Faircloth made an entry into the Congressional Record about Stone's ministry, \\"Ted Stone is a great American who is working to show all Americans that an individual can make a difference in the war against drug abuse.\\" Governor Jim Hunt awarded him the Order of the Long Leaf Pine for his contributions in the areas of mental health and drug abuse prevention. In 2006, Stone received the Richard D. Land Distinguished Service Award from the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Two scholarship funds were established in his name. The Ted Stone Scholarship Fund for Evangelism and Missions at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Ted Stone Scholarship Fund at Southeastern Seminary.

In the state of Washington, women gained and lost the right to vote repeatedly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first champion of women's suffrage in Washington Territory was Arthur A. Denny who introduced a bill to the lower house of the territory in 1854, but it lost 8 to 9.Larson, T. A. \\"The Woman Suffrage Movement in Washington.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly 67, no. 2 (1976): 49-62. After the loss, the subject went silent for 10 years, until 1866 when the election code used language that could allow for women to vote, because it simply stated that \\"all white citizens\\" could vote, Edward Eldridge stood on the house floor and stated that this interpretation included womenPearce, Stella E. \\"Suffrage in the Pacific Northwest: Old Oregon and Washington.\\" The Washington Historical Quarterly 3, no. 2 (1912): 106-14. . For a while many agreed with Eldridge's statement until Mary Olney Brown attempted to cast her vote in Olympia in 1869 and was turned away and told she was not a citizen, in 1870 she tried again and was again denied. At the same time that she was trying to cast her ballot, her sister, Charlotte Olney French and seven other women in Grand Mound, Washington cast their ballots successfully. Harry Morgan of Tacoma was a saloon owner who wanted to make sure that women had no vote, because he feared what they would do for his type of business. He was the backer of the case Harland V.

Seattle, WA: The Washington Equal Suffrage Association , 1909 George Turner was a powerful voice in this case, because he argued that women should not be allowed on a jury, and that suffrage allowed them to do so, and that they needed to reverse women's suffrage to keep them off the jury.Johnson, Claudius O. \\"George Turner of Supreme Court of Washington Territory.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 44, no. 4 (1943): 370-85. Another case that kept the right to vote from Washington from was the Nevada Bloomer case. Nevada Bloomer was the wife of a Spokane saloon owner, who cared little about women's suffrage, but was a very dutiful wife. Her husband along with some local judges, devised a plan in which they would send Nevada to vote and then turn her away so that she could bring her case to the supreme court. The movement would do a lot to support the Bloomer case, although Nevada never had any intention of actually pursuing real action; the case was simply a diversion to keep the issue tied up in the courts and stop women from voting for prohibition.Fahey, John . \\"The Nevada Bloomer Case: An Obedient Wife Played a Key Role in Delaying Women's Suffrage in Washington.\\" Columbia The Magazine of Northwest History 2, no. 2 (1998).

The offensive  = Push to the southwest = PMF forces launched their offensive against ISIL on 25 April, some 100 kilometers southwest of Mosul. PMF also launched an operation to clear the town of Al-Hadar and its surrounding villages from ISIL forces, seizing three villages. By the end of the first day, they had captured 12 villages in the region. PMU announced during the afternoon of 26 April that they had captured the ruins of the ancient city of Hatra. They also stated they had advanced to the edge of the nearby modern town. The city is also strategically significant as it commands access to Nineveh, Saladin and Anbar Governorate. By the third day of the offensive, the PMF had captured 17 villages. They also took over 3 villages in the region during the day and another along with a cemetery. The nearby modern town of Al-Hadar was captured on 27 May. The advance cut-off several desert tracks used by ISIL to move between Iraq and Syria. Three days later, the PMF pushed out of al-Hadar in three directions northwest of the town, capturing another five villages. Meanwhile, PMF intelligence announced that the operation in Al-Hadar was sudden and rapid and placed ISIL in a critical situation in the neighboring Baaj area. Some people started returning to their villages after the buildings had been cleared of mines by the PMF. = Push to the west =  Push to al-Qairawan  On 12 May, the PMF launched the second phase of their offensive, with an operation 100 kilometers west of Mosul. The aim was to secure the towns of al-Qairawan and Al-Ba'aj areas and push ISIL militants further towards the border with Syria. The offensive was backed by Iraqi Air Force's helicopters. The PMU later announced that it had captured four villages while clashing in two other villages. It later announced that it had captured 21 villages around al-Qairawan, killing 77 militants and destroying 15 VBIEDs. On 13 May, PMF stated that it had captured four villages and surrounded one while also capturing the road between Shingal and Qairawan.

The paramilitary forces surrounded the town from three sides, while cutting off the main roads between it and Tal Afar as well as Sinjar. It also stated that an Iraqi Air Force helicopter was shot down, after it came under fire from ISIL while supporting PMF to capture villages located in the desert to the west of Mosul. The PMF stated on 14 May that it had captured the villages of Khailo and Tal al-Qasab near al-Qairawan besides surrounding another village. The statement added that the paramilitary forces were continuously surrounding al-Qairawan from three sides, and had killed 23 militants while also destroying four car bombs.

The PMF meanwhile announced it had captured eight villages to the north and south of the Qayrawan region as part of their operation to drive out the militants from areas near Iraq-Syria border, killing 39 of them in the clashes. The Iraqi military stated on 16 May that the PMU captured three villages to the north and south of al-Qairawan in addition to clashing in another village. By 17 May, 70 percent of the PMF's initial goals as part of their push to the west of Mosul were achieved following the capture or surrounding of more than 30 villages. PMF said that they had cut off a road linking Tal Qasab and Qairawan, which is considered the main ISIL supply route north of Qairawan. Its first brigade repelled an attack by ISIL, which left four attackers dead, and stated that 70 percent of a first phase of clearing operations to recapture the al-Qairawan region has been completed.

Dozens of militants were killed as Iraqi airstrikes destroyed militant locations in Tal Afar on 14 June. JOC stated on 15 June that PMF had captured four villages to the north of Mahlabiyah, in addition to the nearby Mansour industry compound and water facility. War Media Cell announced on 21 May that airstrikes in al-Mahalabiya and Tal Afar town, killed 12 militants and destroyed two booby-trapped vehicles and weapons. Abu Abdullah al-Halabi, the assistant head of ISIL's so-called \\"security committee\\", was shot dead at the center of Tal Afar on 26 June, according to a local source. Abu Hafsa, who was in charge of ISIL drones in Tal Afar, was killed along with a number of companions, after an airstrike hit a secret rest house of the group on the outskirts of Tal Afar, which was used for launching drones on 27 June according to a local source. Iraqi army officer Jabbar Hassan meanwhile said that the 15th Infantry Division had captured six villages outside Tal Afar.  Aftermath  The spokesman of Iraq's Counter-Terrorism Service stated on 30 June 2017 that plans were in place to capture Tal Afar as well as Hawija and it would be ready to participate in the battle to take it. Chief of Staff of the Peshmerga Ministry Jabar Yawar told Rudaw on 2 June 2017 that the Iraqi government planned to advance military operations for Tal Afar and Al Anbar Governorate while delaying an offensive for Hawija. According to a statement on 4 July by Nour Eddin Qablan, deputy chief of Nineveh provincial council, 200 Turkmens were reportedly held and killed by the militants in Tal Afar two months ago, while they were trying to flee to territory under Iraqi control. In addition, a local source stated that the last local leader of the town had been executed by non-Iraqi militants. Twelve militants were meanwhile reported on 8 July to have been killed in Tal Afar in three consecutive airstrikes including a top judiciary official according to local sources, while Ahmed al- Shamri of Nineveh Operations Command stated that the group had executed 10 members for trying to flee. On 29 July, Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi said that the Iraqi government had set a plan to take Tal Afar, \\"I have put forward a plan to liberate Tal Afar with the participation of all (kinds of) security services, in addition to the Hashd Shaabi and Asha'iry (tribal units).\\" The participation of Hashd Shaabi had concerned Turkey which doesn't want the offensive to change the region's ethnic composition. On 1 August, PMF's media bureau stated it had captured seventeen villages to the south of Tal Afar. Iraqi forces on 20 August launched an offensive to recapture Tal Afar.

Narducy is a mainstay in the Chicago-area rock community, having played in bands like Verboten, Jason & Alison, Verbow, as well as being the touring bassist for Bob Mould and Superchunk. Narducy started the project in 2011 and has released two albums: 2014's Fragmented World and 2016's Metal Frames as well as a concert EP, 2015‚Äôs Live EP. Split Single's music aims for power-pop melodies, punchy arrangements and wry and affecting lyrics. Spoon's Britt Daniel played bass and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster are featured on Fragmented World. On sophomore effort Metal Frames, Wurster returned on drums while Wilco's John Stirratt was recruited to play bass.  Career  After not writing any original material for eight years, in 2012 Narducy formed Split Single as an outlet to write 10 new songs to debut opening for Steve Dawson's band Dolly Varden at Schuba's. Three songs from that show, \\"Never Look Back,\\" \\"Love Is You,\\" and \\"My Eyes\\" would later end up on Split Single's debut, Fragmented World. Later, while recording songs for Bob Mould's 2012 solo effort Silver Age, Narducy played bandmate Jon Wurster his demos and the drummer agreed to help properly record them. Spoon's Britt Daniel, who Narducy played with at a 2011 Bob Mould tribute concert, rounded out the recording personnel. To promote Fragmented World, Narducy created a fake documentary short video called \\"The Sexiest Elbows In Rock Music\\". Several comedians and musicians guested in the clip, including Fred Armisen, Tim Meadows, Jon Wurster, John Stirratt, Margaret Cho, Britt Daniel, Mac MacCaughan, Bob Mould, and Dave Grohl. In 2016, Narducy teamed with The Onion to make two more ‚ÄúSexiest Elbows In Rock‚Äù episodes with guest appearances from Jeff Tweedy, Sharon Van Etten, Todd Barry, Michael Shannon, Frank Black and more. Of the album, which was released in spring 2014, Spin's Ryan Leas had this to say, \\"Narducy‚Äôs latest material exhibits strands of all sorts crashing together: ‚Äô80s college rock, ‚Äô90s indie, and various brands of psychedelia mingle freely within the album‚Äôs efficient 32 minutes of power-pop.\\" In a review at The A.V. Club, which gave the album an A-, Annie Zaleski wrote, \\"Fragmented World‚Äôs lyrics are also no afterthought: While their themes are common‚Äîfresh heartbreak, letting go of past romance, despairing about unrequited love‚Äîsongs often twist darker (‚ÄúI laid in your yard last night / But you never looked back, never looked back‚Äù).\\" Metal Frames, Split Single's most recent full-length, was recorded at Chicago's Atlas Studios with engineer Matt Allison. The recording band featured the return of Wurster on drums, new recruit John Stirratt, of Wilco, on bass, and Narducy's longtime friend, recording artist and songwriter Nora O'Connor. Critic Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote of the second album, ‚Äú‚Ä¶a first-rate songwriter and band leader.‚Äù Elsewhere, Magnet Magazine's Matt Hickey wrote, giving the album an Essential New Music designation, \\"With ‚ÄòMetal Frames,‚Äô Narducy not only avoids the sophomore slump, he enters MVP territory‚Äù Split Single have toured with Cymbals Eat Guitars and Divine Fits and have opened shows for Guided by Voices, Eddie Vedder, Wilco, Bob Mould, The Hold Steady, The New Pornographers, and Superchunk.

This type of activity is most often situated in educational programs (but is also found in some youth organizations) in order to increase mutual understanding, global citizenship, digital literacies, and language learning. Models of virtual exchange are also known as telecollaboration, online intercultural exchange, globally networked teaching and learning,Starke-Meyerring, D., Duin, A. H., & Palvetzian, T. (2007). Global partnerships: Positioning technical communication programs in the context of globalization. Technical Communication Quarterly, 16(2), 139-174. collaborative online international learning (COIL). Non-profit organizations such as Soliya (founded by Lucas Welch) and the Sharing Perspectives Foundation have designed and implement virtual exchange programs in partnership with universities and youth organizations. In 2017 the European Commission published a feasibility study into virtual exchange and in 2018 the Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange project was launched in Europe and Southern Mediterranean countries. Educational institutions such as State University of New York's COIL Center and DePaul University use virtual exchange in higher education curricula to connect young people globally with a primary mission to help them grow in their understanding of each other's contexts (society, government, education, religion, environment, gender issues, etc.).  History  The origins of virtual exchange have been linked to the work of iEARN and the New York/Moscow Schools Telecommunications Project (NYS-MSTP) which was launched in 1988 by Peter Copen and the Copen Family Fund. This project stemmed from a perceived need to connect youth from the two countries during a time which was marked by tensions between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that had developed during the Cold War. With the institutional support of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, and the New York State Board of Education, a pilot programme between 12 schools in each nation was established. Students worked in both English and Russian on projects based on their curricula, which had been designed by participating teachers. The program expanded in the early 1990s to include China, Israel, Australia, Spain, Canada, Argentina, and the Netherlands. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the organization iEARN which became officially established in 1994. One of the earliest projects, which is still running, was Margaret Riel's Learning Circles. The organization has since expanded and is currently active in over 100 countries and promotes many different projects, also in collaboration with other organizations such as The My Hero Project. This form of education which aims to integrate awareness of international communities as part of the curriculum is sometimes referred to as global education. In foreign language education the practice of virtually connecting learners is often known as telecollaboration. It was first promoted as a form of network-based language learning in the 1990s through the work of educators such as Mark Warschauer and Rick Kern. Several different models of telecollaboration have since been developed, such as the Cultura model, developed in 1997 at MIT in the United States, and the eTandem model. The Cultura projecthttps://cultura.mit.edu/ was originally developed as a bilingual project for French and English, but has since been developed in several different languages. In 2003 the organization Soliya was founded by Lucas Welch and Liza Chambers in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Soliya's Connect Program has become an important model of online facilitated dialogue and is based on principles of intergroup dialogue and peacebuilding. In this model of virtual exchange, students from universities across the globe are placed in diverse groups of 10-12 people, and they meet regularly for 2-hour sessions of dialogue through a over a period of 8 weeks. Each group is supported by one or two trained facilitators. In 2005 the European Commission established the eTwinning programme for schools. This programme promotes projects between schools in Europe which entail collaborations between classes. eTwinning has established a strong community of teachers and organizes training for them. Pupils do not necessarily communicate directly with one another using technologies however, their contact may be mediated by the teachers. In 2006 the SUNY Center for Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) was established at SUNY's Purchase College. COIL developed from the work of faculty members who used technology to bring international students into their classrooms using technology. COIL's Founding Director was Jon Rubin, a Film and New Media Professor at Purchase College. The COIL model is increasingly being recognized as a way for universities to internationalize their curricula. In 2010 COIL joined the new SUNY Global Center in New York City and continued to expand its global network. In 2011 the Virtual Exchange Coalitionhttp://virtualexchangecoalition.org/ was established in the United States to further the field of Virtual Exchange, bringing together important virtual exchange providers. In 2014 the UNICollaboration platformhttp://uni- collaboration.eu/ was launched in order to support university educators and mobility coordinators to find partner classes, and to organise and run online intercultural exchanges for their students. This platform was one of the outputs of an EU-funded project and has over 1000 registered educators. In 2016 the European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport Tibor Navracsics announced a future Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange initiative. In March 2018 the Erasmus+ Virtual Exchangehttps://europa.eu/youth/erasmusvirtual pilot project was officially launched by Commissioner Navracsics. It is hosted on the European Youth Portal and targets young people (aged 18‚Äì30) in EU and Southern Mediterranean countries. The pilot project reached 8000 young people in 2018, its first year of implementation. Different models of virtual exchange are promoted on the platform as well as training for educators to develop their own virtual exchange projects and training for young people to become Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange facilitators. In 2018, several higher education institutions active in the field of virtual exchange and an international virtual exchange coalition was created that started organizing international virtual exchange conferences (IVEC). The first such conference was scheduled for October 2019 in Tacoma, WA, USA. This inaugural IVEC 2019 conference, entitled \\"Advancing the field of online international learning\\", was co-organized by the SUNY COIL Center, DePaul University, Drexel University, East Carolina University, University of Washington Bothell, University of Washington Tacoma, and UNIcollaboration.  Emerging trends and research  Virtual exchange has evolved and become more diversified to reflect not only emerging pedagogies and technologies over time but it has also adapted to reflect the changing globalized world. = Terminology = Since its inception, virtual exchange has gone by several terms. Among these are: * Online Intercultural Exchange * Telecollaboration * Internet-mediated intercultural foreign language education * Collaborative online international learning (COIL) * Tandem language learning/e-tandem/teletandem * Global virtual teams * Globally-networked learning environments = Role in language and skills development = A considerable amount of research points to the benefits of virtual exchange or telecollaboration partnering. Not only do these partnerships improve linguistic competence, they also develop higher- order thinking skills and contribute to the development of cross-cultural attitudes, knowledge, skills, and awareness. Moreover, virtual exchange activities develop digital literacies as well various multiliteracies. Recent years have also witnessed the emergence of partners using a foreign language such as English not only with native speakers, but also with other non-native speakers as a lingua franca in various virtual exchanges. Studies reveal that these virtual exchanges have equally produced positive results in terms of skills development. While integration of and research into various virtual exchange partnerships have mainly occurred at universities, what is also emerging is an exploration of virtual exchange integration into secondary language education. O'Dowd and Lewis report that up to now, the majority of online exchanges occurs between Western classrooms based in North America and Europe, while the number of partnerships involving other continents and other languages remains small. = Evolving models in foreign language education = A trend that can be observed is that two models have generally guided the approaches adopted in virtual exchange or telecollaborative practice in foreign language learning. The first model, known as e-tandem, focuses primarily on linguistic development which generally involves two native speakers of different languages communicating with each other to practise their target language. These partners perform the role of peer-tutors providing feedback to each other and correcting errors in a digital environment. This model also emphasizes learner autonomy where partners are encouraged to take responsibility for creating the structure to the language exchange with minimal intervention from the teacher The second model, generally referred to as intercultural telecollaboration, emerged with the pedagogical trends of 1990s and 2000s which placed more emphasis on intercultural and sociocultural elements of foreign language learning. This model differs from e-tandem in 3 ways: # Emphasis is placed on the development of cultural knowledge, cultural awareness and not only on linguistic competence # Involvement of structured language programs and class-to-class partnerships rather than add-on or out-of-class exchanges between partners # More involvement and facilitation from a teacher = New technologies = By the end of the 2010s, virtual exchange witnessed a move towards the integration of more informal immersive online environments and Web 2.0 technologies. These tools and environments enabled partners to conduct collaborative tasks reflecting hobbies and interests such as jointly developed music or film projects. Other joint tasks involve website design and development as well as online games and discussion forums. Four major types of technologies dominating virtual exchange practice have been identified by O'Dowd and Lewis: # Asynchronous text-based communication # Videoconferencing # Web 2.0 # Virtual worlds The multitude and array of environments have thus provided greater freedom of choice for intercultural virtual exchange partners. Thorne argues that although these may be considered motivating environments, they involve 'intercultural communication in the wild' and are 'less controllable' as a result (p. 144). The introduction of more structured approaches and frameworks have therefore been witnessed as a trend since the 2010s. The outcome of the INTENT project by the European Commission between 2011 and 2014 led to the creation of the UNICollaboration platformhttp://www.unicollaboration.eu/ which provides necessary resources for educators to set up structured virtual exchange partnerships in universities. The European Telecollaboration for Intercultural Language Acquisition (TILA)http://www.tilaproject.eu/ is an example of a platform of resources for teachers dedicated to integrating structured virtual exchange programs into secondary education. = Structures and frameworks for integration = It is widely recognized that teacher facilitation plays a key role in ensuring the success of virtual exchange partnerships. Teacher-training to integrate successful virtual exchange practice into the classroom has therefore also emerged as a growing trend. Some scholars have advocated for an experiential model approach to training which involves trainee teachers in online exchanges themselves before integrating virtual exchange practice in the classroom. Reports have shown that this approach has impacted positively on successful integration of virtual exchange practice. The types of tasks in virtual exchange partnerships have also become more structured over time. Research shows that the type of task chosen for the virtual exchange plays an important role in the success of learning outcomes. In earlier telecollaborative projects, the expectation was for partners to develop linguistic and cultural competence by simply connecting with partners of their target language. Exchanges were carried out with little reflection on a participant's own or the target culture. An approach that has therefore been suggested to engage and structure the partnership is a task-based language learning approach which focuses on meaning-oriented activities that reflect the real world. = Cross- disciplinary Initiatives = Among other developments in virtual exchange practice, cross-disciplinary telecollaborative initiatives have seen a steady growth. These partnerships not only enable language skills development and enhance intercultural competence but they also enable different cultural perspectives on certain subject areas such as music, history, anthropology, geography education, business studies, community health nursing, and other subjects. Collaborative Online International Learning Network (COIL) created by the State University of New York (SUNY) system is an example of a structured initiative that geographically connects distant partner classes for subject-specific collaboration through online and blended courses. Online intercultural exchange Online intercultural exchange is an academic field of study connected to virtual exchange. It \\"involves instructionally mediated processes...for social interaction between internationally distributed partner classes\\". This activity has its roots in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and computer-mediated communication. OIE is not restricted to language learning but happens across many educational disciplines where there is a desire to increase the internationalization of teaching and learning. Developments in communication technologies and the relative ease with which forms of human communication can be technically afforded internationally since the existence of the internet resulted in language teaching experimentation. Connecting individuals, classrooms or groups of students to work together on tasks online involves attempting to arrive at shared understanding through \\"negotiation of meaning\\"Long, M. H. (1996). The role of the linguistic environment in second language acquisition. Handbook of second language acquisition, 2(2), 413-468. There is a body of research in the failures and successes of the endeavour which have informed a guide to language teacher practice. A consortium of researchers, the INTENT consortium supported by funding from the European Union promoted awareness of telecollaborative activities in Higher Education and the contribution made to internationalising the student experience, publishing a report and a position paper. The history of the evolution of this field was described by researcher Robert O'Dowd in his keynote to the European Computer-Assisted Language Learning Conference EUROCALL in 2015. Publications reveal learner perceptions of such activity.  Virtual exchange is not ...  Virtual exchange is just one way of using technology in education. However there is some confusion around the terminology used in this field. It is helpful to understand that virtual exchange is not distance learning, nor should it be confused with virtual mobility which is more concerned with university students accessing and obtaining credit for taking online courses at universities other than their own. Virtual exchanges are not MOOCs, because they are not massive. In virtual exchange participants interact in small groups, often using synchronous video conferencing tools.

Plot Jesse (John Robb) edits and sells an underground newspaper on the streets of Montreal. He is a firm believer in 'direct action' as a means of changing 'the system.' He and his girlfriend (Elaine Maulus), meet an American draft dodger, David (Gary Rader), who is into 'spiritualism.' Torn between the two, Karen leaves Montreal to join David on a commune while Jesse travels to Chicago for the 1968 Democratic Convention. Tired of David's abstract ideas, Karen leaves him and returns to her life with Jesse. Reception Canadian film historian Peter Morris wrote in 1984 about Prologue in The Film Companion, \\"One of the most important films of the sixties, widely released abroad and well-received by most foreign critics, that at the time was praised for its sensitivity and unpretentious realism, but that in retrospect seems more important for its persuasive and convincing encapsulation of the period's central (if false) dilemma: to drop out or change the system. Despite its documentary-like style, it was carefully scripted (before the Chicago convention); and in theme, style and acting, remains, more than a decade later, a testament to the (unfulfilled) potential of Canadian cinema of the time.\\" \\"Beside the modest and very Canadian self-questioning of Prologue, previous films about drop-outs and the under thirties' revolution in North America begin to appear guilty of over-sell, colour advertisements for a glamorous, swinging and homogenized life-style. It is not simply that Robin Spry's first feature has the inestimable advantage of being shot in down-beat black and white, but rather that his principal characters are too concerned with working out a tenable way of life for themselves to begin laying very much on other people. Far from being anti-social, they are shown to possess a highly developed sense of social responsibility and a faith in the principles of a democracy whose practices they deplore.\\" Sight And Sound \\"This intelligent Canadian film attempts to consider objectively the cases for militant revolution and peaceable dropping-out. Unfortunately, its objectivity is very nearly overthrown by the amount of footage devoted to clever actuality material from the hackle-raising Democratic Convention of 1968 in Chicago, an occasion used more imaginatively by Haskell Wexler in Medium Cool but still potent enough in this different context to sway the sympathy in favour of the activists.\\" Films and Filming \\"Black-and-white photography by Douglas Keifer consistently supports the cin√©ma v√©rit√© style but is equally effective in staged scenes with principles. Music and sound track have an authentic ring. [John] Robb and [Gary] Rader give standout performances for non-pros. Prologue is a safe bet for art houses and the university circuit.

Initially their focus was not political, but expanded to encompass women's suffrage. After more than one hundred years of operation, the council continues to strive for women's equality. History Soon after the National Exhibition of Women's Labor (nl) was held, the board members of the exhibition decided that an umbrella organization called the National Women's Council of the Netherlands () would be beneficial for uniting women in the improvement of their legal, political and socio- economic status in the country. On 29 October 1898 the organization was founded with the first chairman designated as Mariane van Hogendorp and was affiliated with the International Council of Women. The NVR membership was neither tied to political ideology or religious affiliation, which meant that debate on various points of view were welcomed, but also at times made members uncomfortable as their particular customs or practices had to be set aside for the advancement of the whole group. The council had a requirement that all affiliated associations, companies, or organizations have at least one woman who was a member of their governing board. To ensure that no single organization could dominate the other members, the bylaws specified that all decisions had to be unanimous. It was also hoped that such a rule would cause the women to discuss and eliminate issues which were divisive. Among the issues the Council focused upon initially were equal education for girls and boys, the inclusion of women in employment opportunities, health and sanitation legislation, illegitimacy, loss of women's autonomy upon marriage, prostitution, alcoholism, and other social ills. Initially, women's suffrage was not an area in which the women focused; however, increasing involvement of several members like Aletta Jacobs with international suffragists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, led the NVT to begin pressing for political rights. Modern organization In 1972 the National Women's Council was reorganized to become the Dutch Women's Council and throughout the 1980s a corporate structure was adopted changing focus to a more economic focus. By the end of the 1980s, the organization faced a crisis because the Ministry of Welfare, Public Health and Culture saw no need to channel funds into an umbrella organization with such broad reach. That decision in turn, led to a split in the organization in 1992, with one branch retaining the name Dutch Women's Council and the other new organization, Arachne Women's Advice Bureau for Government Policy, being developed to evaluate women's policy issues. Social Participation and Rights of Women remain the goals of the organization, which has approximately 50 affiliated organizations. The organization's archival materials are located at the Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history.

He served as the 43rd Judge Advocate General (JAG) of the United States Navy from June 26, 2015 to September 12, 2018.http://jag.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/09/12/navy- jag-corps-holds-change-of-office-ceremony-2/ He assumed that position after the retirement of Vice Admiral Nanette DeRenzi in June, 2015.  Early life Vice Adm. James W. Crawford III was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He graduated from Belmont Abbey College in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in political science.  Career He was commissioned through the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps Student Program and in 1983 graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Law at Chapel Hill. He later earned a Master of Laws in Ocean and Coastal Law from the University of Miami School of Law and a Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College. Crawford served from 2012-2015 as the deputy judge advocate general of the Navy and commander, Naval Legal Service Command. As commander, Naval Legal Service Command, he led the judge advocates, enlisted legalmen and civilian employees of 14 commands worldwide, providing prosecution and defense services, legal assistance services to individuals and legal support to shore and afloat commands. Crawford served from 2007-2011 as legal counsel to the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. From 2011‚Äì2012, he served as commander, NATO Rule of Law Field Support Mission/Rule of Law Field Force-Afghanistan. Before his appointment to flag rank, he served as special counsel to the chief of naval operations, the senior staff judge advocate for the commander, U.S. Pacific Command and as the fleet judge advocate for U.S. 7th Fleet. In command, he served as commanding officer, Region Legal Service Office Southeast. Crawford also served at Navy Personnel Command; the Office of the Legal Counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Naval War College; commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe; the Naval Justice School and Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8. He began his legal career as a defense counsel at the Naval Legal Service Trial Defense Activity, Naval Air Station Jacksonville. Crawford was the 43rd Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Crawford is the principal military legal counsel to the Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations and serves as the Department of Defense representative for ocean policy affairs (REPOPA). He led 2,300 attorneys, enlisted legalmen and civilian employees of the worldwide Navy JAG Corps community. Crawford is a member of the state bar of North Carolina. His personal decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal (three awards), the Legion of Merit (three awards), the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal (two awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (three awards) and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. Crawford's long career ended under a cloud. Less than two months prior to his retirement, the Navy Times reported on a ruling from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces that he had illegally influenced the prosecution of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Keith E. Barry (on charges of rape of a girlfriend). Senior Chief Barry's conviction was overturned on that appeal and dismissed with prejudice. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces found Crawford's involvement constituted \\"unlawful influence.\\" In reaching this conclusion, the court applied Article 37 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which at the time of his conduct prohibited judge advocates (and others subject to the code) from \\"unlawfully influencing action of court.\\" The appellate attorney for the exonerated Senior Chief urged that the Navy not allow for Crawford's upcoming retirement, but instead to place him on legal hold and go forward with a prosecution of Crawford for this charge of UCI. Defense attorneys in other cases have alleged similar improper influence by Crawford. According to his official US Navy biography, Crawford retired on November 1, 2018. There is no mention within his official biography of this appellate finding of UCI on his part.

Paleobiology P. anglicus is important to our understanding of early vertebrate evolution as it preserves part of the braincase, a scientifically informative part of the skeleton. Because of the cartilaginous makeup of the acanthodian internal skeleton, it is very rarely preserved, and the braincase of Ptomacanthus is only the second acanthodian braincase known to science (the first being that of Acanthodes).

He is more commonly known by his ringname Mike Mendoza. Early in his career he worked as Enigma (stylized as Eni?ma), continuing to perform under the name for some time afterwards. Ortiz began his career in the International Wrestling Association (IWA) as a cruiserweight, winning the division's title before ascending to the lower mid-tier and later performing in the tag team division and winning the EWO World Tag Team Championship in an interpromotional angle with the large independent promotion Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO). In 2013, he debuted in the World Wrestling Council (WWC), where he reigned in the junior heavyweight and tag team divisions before concluding his stay following a run with the second-tier WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. In 2017, Ortiz joined Liga Wrestling (then known as the World Wrestling League), where he is a two-time WWL World Heavyweight Champion. Wrestling career =International Wrestling Association (2010‚Äì2012)= To begin his career, Ortiz adopted the gimmick of \\"Enigma\\", initially wrestling under a mask. On March 20, 2010, he debuted in the International Wrestling Association (IWA), winning his contest in the first round of a tournament to determine the first contender of the cruiserweight-based Xtreme Combat Division. On June 26, 2010, he competed in a royal rumble for the 5th Jos√© Miguel P√©rez Cup being the tenth eliminated competitor. On that same event, Ortiz unsuccessfully challenged for the XCD Championship. On March 5, 2011, the IWA's president Miguel P√©rez, Jr. declared that since the XCD Champion had vacated the title due to injury, a four-way match would take place at Juicio Final, but for the traditional IWA Cruiserweight Championship. On March 19, 2011, Ort√≠z lost a contest to Dennis Rivera. On June 4, 2011, Ortiz won the IWA Cruiserweight Championship. During his reign, the IWA decided to drop the division. This decision was explained in story line, when a now more muscular Ortiz explained that he had surpassed the constraints of a cruiserweight division, choosing instead to create a new championship and become the self-proclaimed \\"IWA Television Champion\\". At Halloween Mayhem 2011, he defeated a jobber using an inverted neck breaker. At Histeria Boricua, he participated in a tournament for the Television Championship, winning two contests but losing the final to Carlos Cupules. At Kaos and Odissey, Ortiz surprised by aiding his former adversary in a title defense and joining him to form a team known as Controversial Inc. or Los Controversiales. On February 25, 2012, he and Cupules entered an interpromotional angle that had been running between the IWA and the Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO) since December 2011. In their debut in EWO, they captured the EWO World Tag Team Championship and promptly rebranded them as the ‚ÄúYou T√∫ Tag Team Championship‚Äù. They held the titles until May, when Doom Patrol won it in a three-way match that included Los Sorprendentes Lights. Afterwards, Los Controversiales remained involved in the title picture. =Independent circuit (2012‚Äì2013)= After the IWA entered a hiatus, Ortiz continued performing in the local independent circuit as part of Los Controversiales along Cupeles. In July they appeared at the Puerto Rico/Panama based International Gladiators Wrestling Alliance (IGWA), self- proclaiming themselves tag team champions. During the second half of 2012, EWO became involved in a charity campaign known as Ponte Pa‚Äô lo +, which was turned into an angle after several of the wrestlers involved were attacked by masked ‚Äúnegative‚Äù counterparts. Team Positivo and Team Negativo clashed throughout the following months. On December 15, 2012, the heels lost their masks in a bet between both teams, revealing their identity as Ortiz, Cupeles, Real Michael, Two Face, Joseph Cruz ‚ÄúJ.C.‚Äù Navarro and Oscar Anderson. Joined by the latter, the three became known as Los Realengos and issued a challenge in January 2013, which was accepted by Spider and Jason Sparks. The team feuded with Los Sorprendentes Lights during this timeframe. On April 13, 2013, they were forced to leave the promotion following a ‚Äúloser leaves town‚Äù against the Lights and Rapero JP. =World Wrestling Council (2013‚Äì2017)= His 2014 campaign earned him the \\"Most Improved Wrestler\\" award from Puerto Rico Wrestling, which is determined by popular vote. In 2016, he was voted \\"Most Improved Wrestler\\" for the second time in the PRW awards. =World Wrestling League (2017‚Äì2019)= On May 11, 2017, WWL aired a segment where Mendoza overheard a conversation between Mr. 450 and Konnan, members of an invading faction known as La Junta de Control (lit. \\"The Control Board\\", a reference to PROMESA). After the former rebelled against the latter in a face turn and was jumped by the rest of the group, Ortiz made the save accompanied by Angel Fashion (who had left WWC shortly before him) and the three then made an alliance with the stable known as Westside Mafia to oppose the invaders. Having been jumped by La Junta for failing to win the WWL World Heavyweight Championship, Mr. 450 became the unofficial leader of this coalition. Both debutants were unable to attend WWL's next card due to pre-existing arrangements to participate in Cleveland Knights Championship Wrestling's (CKCW) Vanished Empire event, where he faced Matt Justice. Instead, the promotion ran an angle were the leader of the Puro Macho stable and La Junta's COO, Manny Ferno, visited his grandfather's gym and attacked his brother, Christian Ortiz, who was training to become a wrestler. On June 24, 2017, Mendoza made his in-ring debut by defeating Puro Macho member \\"J.C.\\" Navarro, but the group once again attacked his brother and broke one of his arms as part of the storyline. In his second appearance at CKCW, Mendoza teamed with P√©rez in a loss to the team known as Stateline. Growing increasingly frustrated, Ferno requested the intervention of one of Konnan's stables, Impact Wrestling's Latin American Exchange. Mendoza and P√©rez, now collectively known as La Tercera Generaci√≥n, defeated the unified Global Force Wrestling/Impact Wrestling World Tag Team Champions √Ångel Ortiz and Mike Draztic in the first confrontation between groups. On July 15, 2017, 450 defeated Joseph Cruz \\"J.C.\\" Navarro in a first contenders match, stole the WWL World Heavyweight Championship belt and rebranded himself the Mecha Wolf 450, in the process turning on the faces. After months of hiatus caused by hurricane Maria, WWL returned with Juicio Final in April 2018, where Mendoza teamed with Vargas in a loss to La Hermandad. By May 2018, Tercera Generaci√≥n had become involved in a series for the World Tag Team Championship against Primos Mel√©ndez and titlists Westside Mafia, coming up short in their opportunities. Interested in the WWL World Heavyweight Championship, Mendoza attacked both the incumbent Mecha Wolf 450 and surprise challenger BJ. As both members expressed titular ambitions, frictions became evident among Tercera Generaci√≥n, notably at War in the West 2018. In Destino Final 2018, Mendoza suffered a fibula fracture during a three-way match (which included both his teammate and new champion BJ) for the WWL World Heavyweight Championship. Following surgery and therapy, he made his return in January 2019. While Tercera Generaci√≥n was still trying to work out their internal differences, Mendoza was attacked by BJ. He pursued revenge later in the event, but his intervention in a titular match also angered Fashion. After BJ retained, Mendoza attacked the incumbent, only to be jumped by new arrival Mighty Ursus. On March 15, 2019, he became the first contender for the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating the latter as part of Todo o Nada. Later in the event, Mendoza turned on Fashion by costing his tag team partner the last titular opportunity that he would have until the title changed hands. A title shot was scheduled, and later signed, for Apuesta Letal on May 17, 2019, where BJ retained. Mendoza was then pushed to the background as an underling of a mysterious adviser to the heels simply known as ‚ÄúEl Conciliario‚Äù, who gave him tasks through Tommy Diablo. On June 15, 2019, Mendoza won the World Heavyweight Championship due to outside intervention. For War in the West 2019, he teamed with Thunder and Lightning in a loss to BJ, Justin Dynamite and Star Roger. The identity of the adviser was revealed to be El Bronco, but his role atop the heel stable was short lived, since Diablo led them in a rebellion. Despite being reduced to a secondary role and being hounded by an unknown masked assailant, Mendoza scored successful defenses over Roger (twice, in regular and iron man matches) and Justin Dynamite. At Insurrection, he lost the title against a returning Fashion (revealed to have been the mysterious figure), failing to recapture it at La Revancha. On November 15, 2019, Mendoza closed the year with a win over Navarro at Guerra de Poder, since Black Xmas was later cancelled. =Liga Wrestling (2020‚Äìpresent)= In the final event held under the WWL brand after the promotion rebranded to Liga Wrestling, El Fin, Mendoza won a three-way match over Fashion and BJ to win his second World Heavyweight Championship. However, he dropped the title to Star Roger before the show was over. =Abroad (2017‚Äìpresent)= After all activity in the local wrestling scene entered a hiatus following Hurricane Maria, he focused on expanding his career internationally. In October 2017, Ortiz spent a week at WWE's Performance Center and participated in the promotion's fall tryouts. The following week, the debut of both members of Tercera Generaci√≥n at The Crash was announced. However, it never formalized, with Konnan leaving the promotion for Aro Lucha shortly afterwards. Instead, Ortiz participated in CKCW's anniversary show where \\"Sensacional\\" Roger D√≠az retained the heavyweight championship of local independent promotion CWA in a fatal four-way match. In the interim, he made an appearance for NEW (an independent promotion organized by WWL co-worker Nelmarie \\"Roxxy\\" Tirado) defeating one of his students, the posh masked wrestler known as El Gentil. While the larger companies remained in a hiatus, Ortiz made an appearance in the season closer of CWA, where he attacked D√≠az and in subsequent skits between both a challenge was issued. His 2017 campaign earned him the awards for \\"Revelation of the Year\\" and \\"Match of the Year\\" (for Tercera Generaci√≥n's match with LAX), this time by Impacto Estelar's panel of local bookers, former wrestlers and administrative personnel. Ortiz was the wrestler that appeared in most categories, also gathering votes in \\"Wrestler of the Year\\" and \\"Best (Strong Style) Striker\\". CKCW acquired the rights to organize the match for the CWA World Heavyweight Championship for its New World Rising event held at Parma, Ohio on February 9, 2018. There, Roger retained the title, but was attacked by Tercera Generaci√≥n afterwards. At CKCW, the three members of Tercera Generaci√≥n became part of The Holy Fashion, a stable that began in the independent circuit of Florida and originally consisted of Fashion, El Nazareno and Carlos Cupeles. They began a list of \\"#Blessed\\" wrestlers, which compiled those laid out by the group. At CKCW, the remaining two members of Tercera Generaci√≥n became part of The Holy Fashion. The group began a list of \\"Hall of #Blessed\\" wrestlers, which compiled those laid out by the group. Roger D√≠az and Justin Dynamite (Jonathan Merced) were its inaugural members in this event. On May 20, 2018, Mendoza and Fashion (now rebranded as La Marea) defeated Thunder and Lightning to win the CKCW Tag Team Championship. In July 2018, Mendoza made a return to IGWA in Kingdom of Champions, being paired against BJ. Following months of inactivity caused by injury, Mendoza made his first international appearance of 2019 at Mucha Lucha Atlanta's Katastrofe 2K19, once again appearing as part of La Anexi√≥n. This was followed by a return to CKWK, where Tercera Generaci√≥n reunited to defend their titles against La Rebeli√≥n Amarilla. During the summer, he joined Fashion to face the Lucha Brothers in representation of La Anexi√≥n as part of MLA19 Dystopia. Mendoza‚Äôs final abroad appearance of the year took place on December 6, 2019, at CKCW‚Äôs Obliteration, where La Marea faced Star Roger and BJ.

Born in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico to Victor Ortiz Sugra√±es, Sr. and Brenda Negr√≥n, being one of five siblings born to the patriarch, along Christian, Manuel Alejandro, Camila and Sergio. He is also the father of V√≠ctor III (with Margieliz Fortis) and Victoria (with Kendra Castro). His grandfather performed throughout Latin America before arriving to WWC, where he worked as a wrestler, referee and villanous manager. Upon retiring, he established a gymnasium, Vikingo Power Gym, which was affiliated to the IWA during the 2000-10s and hosted the defunct Savio Vega Wrestling Academy, which served as the promotion's main developmental school, being managed by Juan \\"Savio Vega\\" Rivera. Ortiz, a medalist in the Liga Atl√©tica Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico as an amateur wrestler, began training there interested in following the family's trade. Nowadays, Ortiz (who also has a background in Brazilian jiu-jitsu) works as a personal trainer in Definition Elite Fitness. Having previously worked as a trainer in a professional wrestling school based in his grandfather's Vikingo Power Gym, he opened the Esp√≠ritu Pro Wrestling Dojo in 2018, where additional seminars are hosted by international talents. Among his alumni is Olympic silver medalist Jaime Espinal, who was approached by WWE after beginning his classes. Ortiz has continued training the freestyle wrestler since then, preparing him for a tryout held in March 2017 and afterwards.

She remained in service until the end of the First World War. Design and construction Delfino was designed by marine engineer Giacinto Pullino at the La Spezia Navy Yard. Accounts vary as to the date of her construction; it seems that she was built as an experimental craft and was under trials for several years before being accepted by the Italian Navy. Delfino was laid down in 1889, launched in 1890 and completed in 1892. She commenced trials on April 1892 which continued until April 1895, when she was commissioned into the Regia Marina. (Her official records say she was built between 1892 and 1895, and was commissioned in 1896) Delfino was a single hull design, powered by a 65 hp Savigliano electric motor driving a single screw, giving a surface speed of 6 knots and a submerged speed of 5 knots, with a range of 24 nautical miles cruising at 2 knots.. She was controlled by vertical rudders two aft and unusually one forward) and horizontal planes fore and aft. She also had two vertical axis propellers to power vertical movement underwater, but these proved to give little advantage. She was armed with one 350mm torpedo tube and had a complement of 8 crewmen. Delfino was modernized between 1902 and 1904; she was equipped with a 130 hp FIAT petrol engine which increased her surface speed to 10 knots, and her surface range to 165 nautical miles cruising at 6 knots. The torpedo tube was changed to 450mm and her conning tower was enlarged for surface navigation.Delfino at navypedia.orgDelfino at sommergibili.com Service career Delfino was commissioned on 1 April 1895 (official records say 1896) and she served with the Regia Marina into the 20th century. She was still in service at the outbreak of World War I and saw action in the Adriatic, carrying out some 44 war patrols, though she also served as a training vessel. At the end of hostilities Delfino was moved into reserve, and was stricken in January 1919.

Operational history A 2014 review of the design in Sail Magazine said, \\"the Bayfield 25 is well known for its 1,500-pound full keel that draws less than 3 feet, shippy-looking miniature bowsprit and comfortable living spaces that provide 6 feet of standing headroom.\\" Owner Barb Constans said of the design, \\"She's a great boat. She's faster than our [Southern Cross] 31 was, and she can go out in 25 to 30 knots [of wind] with two reefs in the main; she just jogs right along. She handles waves well. We're really pleased with her.\\" In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"The Bayfield 25 fits many people's definition of a true pocket cruising sailboat. It has a miniature bowsprit and shoal draft full-keel, and it comes complete with a diesel engine and very livable interior with standing headroom. Not bad for a boat whose length is more like 24 feet, if you don't count the bowsprit. This boat does, however, have a small cockpit. Another drawback is that it takes a fair amount of wind to get these boat moving at a good clip. Many cruising sailboats sacrifice some performance in favour of comfort and livability, and these tend to be more noticeable on smaller designs. On the other hand, Bayfield sailors will be out enjoying strong winds when many other boats will be heading back to port.\\" See also Bayfield 25 Bayfield 25 *List of sailing boat types Related development *Bayfield 30/32 Similar sailboats *Beachcomber 25 *Beneteau First 25.7 *Beneteau First 25S *Beneteau First 260 Spirit *Bombardier 7.6 *C&C; 25 *C&C; 25 Redline *Cal 25 *Cal 2-25 *Capri 25 *Catalina 25 *Catalina 250 *Com- Pac 25 *Dufour 1800 *Freedom 25 *Hunter 25.5 *Kelt 7.6 *Kirby 25 *MacGregor 25 *Merit 25 *Mirage 25 *Northern 25 *O'Day 25 *Outlaw 26 *Sirius 26 *Tanzer 25 *US Yachts US 25 *Watkins 25 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Bayfield 25"},{"id":"54080027","text":"Delfino is the name of two submarines of the Italian Navy, and may refer to: * , a pioneering submarine completed in 1892 and commissioned in 1895, which saw action in the First World War and was stricken in 1919 * , a submarine completed in 1931, which saw action in the Second World War and was lost accidentally in 1943 Category:Italian Navy ship names ","title":"Italian submarine Delfino"},{"id":"54080035","title":"2017 FA Trophy Final"},{"id":"54080046","text":"Koinambe is a village in the Jimi District of Jiwaka Province in Papua New Guinea.

Tokyu built ten cars in 1990‚Äì1991 as a precursor to the larger C3 order, which would be built by Kawasaki in the late 1990s. The cars were designed by Commonwealth Engineering (Comeng), one of the last projects that the firm undertook before closing in 1990. After the arrival of the C3s, the Long Island Rail Road sold the C1s to private owners.  Background  In the 1980s, the LIRR operated two types of trains: electric multiple units, which operated over the railroad's electrified lines, and diesel locomotive-hauled trains on the non-electrified portions. Service into the borough of Manhattan was electric only. The rolling stock, which comprised the LIRR's diesel service, was aging, and there was political interest in offering a one-seat ride for commuters on the busy, but only partially electrified Port Jefferson Branch. The LIRR decided to solve both problems simultaneously: it would acquire several dual-mode EMD FL9 locomotives from the Metro-North Railroad and buy a small fleet of new passenger cars to go with them. If the experiment was successful, it could proceed with a larger order and replace the diesel fleet.  History  The Budd Company had built the most recent additions to the LIRR's electric fleet, the M1 and M3, but by the mid-1980s, it was a subsidiary of Thyssen and exiting the railroad business. Therefore, in 1986, the LIRR approached Comeng, Budd's Australian licensee, about the project. The LIRR's original request for proposal, issued in 1986, called for a single-level design. This was due in part to the difficulties the railroad experienced with the PRR MP70 electric multiple units, which it had retired in 1972. Comeng persuaded the LIRR to adopt a bilevel design instead. Three groups responded to the revised LIRR proposal: Comeng/Mitsui, Alsthom, and Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo. The LIRR favored the Comeng design, but the latter's ability to fulfill the contract was jeopardized by the instability of Australian National Industries, Comeng's corporate parent. In the end, Comeng sold the design of the C1 to Mitsui, who then engaged Tokyu Car Corporation to build the cars. The LIRR officially ordered ten cars from Mitsui on October 7, 1988. The contract was estimated at $22.4 million. Comeng remained involved in design and testing. Kawasaki C3, which began entering service in 1997. Tokyu constructed the cars between 1990‚Äì1991, with deliveries completing in early 1991. Trains began running in August 1991. The cars ran well and were well-received by commuters. The rebuilt FL9 locomotives allowed operation through the East River Tunnels into Pennsylvania Station. The LIRR proceeded with a full production order in 1994. Several former Comeng engineers drafted the specification for what became the C3 car. This design was based on the C1, but updated based on several years' experience with the cars and feedback from passengers. The C1s were mechanically incompatible with the C3s and were stored as the new cars arrived in 1997‚Äì1998. The LIRR sold them to Mid Atlantic Rail Car in 1999. Iowa Pacific Holdings acquired them in 2007 for use on various excursion services.  Design  The C1 stands tall. This was necessary in order for the car to fit through the East River Tunnels, and shorter than similar designs such as the gallery cars used in Chicago or Amtrak's Superliners, both of which exceed . The cars are long and wide. The car has vestibules at both ends. It was designed for use at high-level platforms, so the doors sit roughly above the rail. The interior is split into lower and upper levels, with accessible seating on the entrance level. On the upper and lower levels, seating is 3‚Äì2. This dense arrangement permits a maximum capacity of 180‚Äì190 passengers. Each level measures from floor to ceiling. Passenger response to the 3‚Äì2 seating was poor, leading to the adoption of 2‚Äì2 seating in the C3.

They are intelligent and serious but they could not pass a college-entrance examination after such a long interruption of their studies. They want to try a college course, perhaps only one or two, before deciding whether they can go on. We let them try. Why not?\\"Quote from interview, cited in 1987 obituary in New York Times. Hacker's research interests were in the field of American history and its social economic development, as well as the life and work of some of its greatest entrepreneurs such as Andrew Carnegie, Alexander Hamilton and Joseph M.

He was the successor of Ardashir I Kushanshah. He was an energetic ruler, who minted coins in Balkh, Herat, and Gandhara. Under him, the Kushano-Sasanians further expanded their domains into the west, pushing the weakened Kushan Empire to Mathura in North India. Peroz I Kushanshah was succeeded by Hormizd I Kushanshah in 275.  Name  \\"Peroz\\" is a Middle Persian name, meaning \\"victorious\\". Peroz I Kushanshah was notably the first ruler from the Sasanian family to use this name. Centuries later, the name would be used again by the imperial line of the Sasanians, commencing with Peroz I ().  Reign  Map of the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom \\"Kushano- Sasanian\\" is a historiographic term used by modern scholars when referring to a dynasty of monarchs who supplanted the Kushan Empire in the Tukharistan region, and ultimately in both Kabulistan and Gandhara as well. According to the historian Khodadad Rezakhani, the dynasty was seemingly a young branch of the House of Sasan, and perhaps an offspring of one of the Sasanian King of Kings. It was founded by Ardashir I Kushanshah () after his appointment by the first Sasanian King of Kings, Ardashir I (). The Kushano-Sasanians, in the same manner as the Kushans, used the title of Kushanshah (\\"Kushan King\\"), thus demonstrating a continuum with their predecessors. Peroz became Kushanshah in 245. =Sasanian-style coinage= Like his predecessor Ardashir I Kushanshah, Peroz is called the \\"Great Kushan King\\" and \\"Mazdean (Zoroastrian) lord\\" on his coins. In some of the rare coins of Peroz, the \\"Investiture issue\\", minted at Herat (HLYDY), the obverse legend reads mzdztn bgy pylwcy rb‚Äô kw≈°‚Äôn mdw‚Äô in Pahlavi, \\"The Mazda-worshipping lord Peroz the Great Kushan Shah\\". On the reverse, Peroz is seen standing on the left, facing Anahita rising from her throne. Peroz is holding an investiture wreath over an altar and raising the left hand in gesture of benediction. Anahita also holds an investiture wreath and a scepter. =Kushan-style coinage= Kushan coins, minted at Balkh. Obverse: King in armour making an offering at an altar. Nandipada symbol, swastika between the legs, Brahmi letter 12px Pi to the right. Bactrian legend around \\"Peroz the Great Kushan King\\" Reverse: Kushan god Oesho, Bactrian legend \\"The exalted God\\". Peroz's reign marked a shift in Kushano-Sasanian coinage, which came to closely resemble the coinage of the Kushan emperors. He was the first Kushano-Sasanian ruler to issue coins on the Kushan model. The gold coins of Peroz tended to be scyphate and to imitate the design of Kushan ruler Vasudeva I. They were often minted at Balkh, in Bactria, north of the Hindu-Kush. The visual aspect of this new coin type was almost identical to those of the Kushans, albeit with specific adjustments. The front of Peroz's coins portrays him standing in Kushan armour making an offering at an altar, at the same time holding a spear in his right hand (the armour style is rather described as Sasanian-style clothing by Rezakhani). Several symbols are included in the coin: a trident over the altar, what is often described as a Nandipada symbol behind the king, and a swastika between the legs. A Brahmi letter 12px Pi has also been introduced to the right of the ruler, near the ground. The obverse has a legend in Bactrian script all around (starting 14:00 o'clock): Œ†ŒπœÅœâœÇŒø ŒøŒøœÇŒøœÅŒ∫Œø ŒöŒøœ∏Œ±ŒΩŒø œ∏Œ±Œ∑Œø \\"Peroz the Great Kushan King\\" In this, like his predecessor Ardashir I Kushanshah, Peroz called himself the \\"Great Kushan King\\". The reverse has a Kushan-style representation of the Kushan god Oesho (in Bactrian ŒüŒ∑œ∏Œø on the corresponding Kushan coins), which uses the attributes of the Indian God Shiva, stading in front of the bull Nandi, and holding a trident and a diadem. This new reverse deity replaced the previous depictions of the Zoroastrian deities Mithra or Anahita in Kushano-Sasanian coinage. In the Kushan-style coinage of Peroz, although the depiction of the deity is visually similar to that on the Kushan coins, the legend is not the Kushan word Oesho (ŒüŒ∑œ∏Œø) anymore, but has been replaced by the Bactrian legend ŒøŒøœÅœÇŒøŒ±ŒΩŒ¥Œø ŒπŒ±œÇŒøŒ¥Œø or BŒüPZAŒüANŒîŒü IAZAŒîŒü \\"The exalted God\\". Apart from minting coins in the Kushano-Sasanian main base of Tukharistan, Peroz also had coins minted in Gandhara and Begram, and most likely in Peshawar as well. It was around this time that the Kushano-Sasanians began to expel the Kushans from Gandhara, pushing them to Mathura in North India, where their power was diminished from that of kings to local princes. Peroz was thus the first Kushano-Sasanian ruler to issue coins south of the Hindu-Kush, and he is known for several overstrikes over coins of the Kushan ruler Kanishka II. =The Ka'ba-ye Zartosht inscription= The Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, where the inscription of Shapur I is engraved It was during Peroz's reign‚Äîin c. 262‚Äîthat the Sasanian King of Kings Shapur I () carved the Ka'ba- ye Zartosht inscription. On the inscription, Shapur I proclaimed himself as the suzerain of several regions, including that of the Kushano-Sasanians: Nevertheless, according to Rezakhani, the Kushano-Sasanians appear to have been too strong to have been plainly Sasanian governors, and their existence \\"may well reflect an early Sasanian continuation of the Arsacid imperial setting, acting as an allied, but autonomous, cadet branch of the Sasanian royal house\\". According to the historian Richard Payne, \\"the Kushano‚ÄìSasanian sub-kingdom ruled from Balkh on behalf of the Sasanian kings of kings\\". In 275, Peroz was succeeded by Hormizd I Kushanshah, a son of the King of Kings Bahram I ().

She co-wrote and co-produced the track with Jack Antonoff, with additional production from Flume and Malay. \\"The Louvre\\" is an electropop song which has influences of other genres such as indie rock and ambient music. Its name derives from the Louvre, an art museum in Paris, France. The lyrics talk about Lorde's honest, lightly-manic analysis of a newly-sparked romance comparing it to a painting hung behind the quintessential works of the Louvre. Reviewers praised the song's lyrics and production, and it landed on several year-end lists. Its guitar riff was compared to Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Born to Run\\" (1975), and the sound to Taylor Swift's album 1989 (2014). The track centers around themes of obsession and infatuation as it continues the narrative established in the previous song, \\"Homemade Dynamite\\". Lorde performed \\"The Louvre\\", with six other songs, as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album, and at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival. It was part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì18). Recording and composition The Louvre art museum in Paris, France, the song's namesake (pictured) Lorde recorded \\"The Louvre\\" at three different locations in the United States. She began recording at Conway Recording Studios, in Los Angeles, California, assisted by recording engineer Eric Eylands. They also recorded at Rough Customer Studio, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, with Barry McCready and Jack Antonoff. Recording was completed at Westlake Recording Studios, in Los Angeles, with Greg Eliason. John Hanes mixed the song at MixStar Studios, assisted by John Hanes. Flume provided the song's bass line and drums, while Malay produced the electronic beats. Both provided additional production for the track. \\"The Louvre\\" is composed in the key of C Major with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Lorde's vocals span a range of E3 to A4 and its chord progression follows a sequence of C‚ÄìC/E‚ÄìF5‚ÄìA5‚ÄìG5 in the verses and outro. It is an electropop song, with influences of other genres such as indie rock and ambient music. According to Nolan Feeley of Entertainment Weekly, \\"The Louvre\\" describes the early stages of a casual relationship \\"doomed to fail\\". The song starts with Lorde's voice accompanied by a guitar, before becoming \\"a storm of glitchy electro-pop.\\" NME described it as a \\"wide-eyed, heart-skippy pop\\" track. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that it seemed \\"highly unlikely that any pop song this year\\" would craft a better chorus than \\"The Louvre\\". Newsweek noted Phil Collins' influence on the track, while its guitar riff was compared to Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Born to Run\\" (1975) and the production on Taylor Swift's album 1989 (2014). In a podcast interview with The Spinoff, Lorde revealed that she wanted to evoke the feeling of the \\"big sun-soaked dumbness of falling in love,\\" and the intense emotion of \\"big dumb joy\\". She said that the \\"instrumentation\\" helped reflect those emotions. The singer also disclosed that Frank Ocean's Blonde (2016) album served as inspiration for constructing the track's sound. Lorde spoke of how in a \\"post-Blonde landscape\\", instrumentation in songs has become more flexible. She stated that she could have made a \\"big, easy single\\" but refrained from doing so as she felt it would not mean much to \\"simplify the journey\\" or \\"force a big chorus.\\" Reception outro was compared to Irish rock band The Cranberries (Dolores O'Riordan pictured) \\"The Louvre\\" received critical acclaim from music critics, with many praising its lyrics and production; it was also called a stand-out track on Melodrama. In a review roundup for The Fader, editor Aimee Cliff said that Lorde captured the \\"self-importance of first love so well.\\" Patrick D. McDermott compared the guitar outro to the work of The Cure or The Cranberries. Will Richards from DIY noted that a \\"rushed lyric half way through the second verse epitomises the whole record\\". Kitty Empire of The Guardian called it a \\"dazzling synthesis of pro-dramatics and originality\\", while Pitchforks Stacey Anderson noted the song captured a \\"shared frequency of love just as irrepressibly grandiose as its sound\\". Several critics placed \\"The Louvre\\" on their year- end, best songs lists. Stereogum put the recording in the number 13 spot on its year-end list. On their year-end list, Vice editor Larry Fitzmaurice ranked the song at number 47, calling it one of the album's \\"weirdest moments\\". On Spins year-end list, \\"The Louvre\\" was ranked at number nine, with the publication calling it one of Lorde's \\"strongest [songs] to date\\". Pitchfork ranked the track at number 42 of the year-end list, while on their retrospective list of the 200 Best Songs of the 2010s, \\"The Louvre\\" ranked at number 43. The publication praised Lorde for being able to take a \\"feeling everyone knows and transform it into something fresh\\". \\"The Louvre\\" entered the Recorded Music NZ Heatseeker Singles chart at number one on 26 June 2017. It also entered the NZ Artists Singles Chart at number five that week, before peaking at number four. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for exceeding 35,000 shipments. Live performances Lorde first performed \\"The Louvre\\" at the Glastonbury Festival. The performance began with a clear box slowly filling with dancers, followed by Lorde's arrival. The box was described as tilting \\"back-and-forth\\" above the singer's head as the performance continued. She dedicated the track to any audience member \\"harbouring a secret crush.\\" The performance received acclaim from critics, with The Independent giving it a four out of five-star review, calling it a \\"bold and brilliant\\" debut. The track was also performed at the Bowery Auditorium in New York City, on the night of the singer's album release party, with two other tracks. For the Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì18), Lorde performed \\"The Louvre\\" after her first costume change. It was proceeded by vintage video snippets that flicker across a \\"giant old-school TV.\\" A reviewer for the London Evening Standard described the videos as \\"art and music merged into a cohesive exploration of love, loss and loneliness.\\" The track was performed second in a set of three acts. After the clips, Lorde returned to the stage wearing a white gown, a different look from the black chiffon dress she wore earlier. She prefaced each song with a backstory, saying \\"The Louvre\\" is about the \\"ups and downs of a new crush.\\" Credits and personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Melodrama.

She wrote and co- produced the track with Jack Antonoff, with additional production from Frank Dukes. It draws influences from genres such as industrial music and noise music, and uses a distorted synthesizer. \\"Loveless\\" includes two samples: a voice sample taken from a documentary about Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland, and a drum solo from Phil Collins' 1981 song \\"In the Air Tonight\\". The lyrics detail the emotions of falling out of love while mocking the current generation's lengths to pretend to be unaffected by love. The song received positive reviews from music critics. \\"Hard Feelings\\" was praised for its songwriting and experimental production; her vocal delivery, however, was criticised on \\"Loveless\\". The lyrics were compared to the 1987 psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction, while its production was likened to Kanye West's work on his 2013 album Yeezus. The track's themes center on the effects of heartbreak and social issues around love. Lorde performed \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\", with six other songs, as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album. It was also part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì18). Background and development \\"Loveless\\" contains a sample from Paul Simon (pictured in 1966) on his documentary about his 1986 album Graceland. Lorde revealed in an interview with The Spinoff that the first two lines from \\"Loveless\\", \\"What is this tape? / This is my favorite tape\\" were sampled from a documentary she watched about Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland. The drum solo, used as the transition instrument for \\"Loveless\\", was sampled from Phil Collins' 1981 song \\"In the Air Tonight\\". Lorde stated that this was one of the earliest tracks on the record. She often listened to the soft rock music of Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Simon while riding the subways in New York City, or on cab rides after attending parties in her hometown of Auckland. They were sources of inspiration for \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\". Despite not being credited for production, Lorde said that Malay brought in some guitars which they used for \\"Hard Feelings\\". In a The New York Times profile, Jack Antonoff called the song the \\"calm after a big fight\\". He also said that \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" reminded him of Don Henley's 1989 song \\"The Heart of the Matter\\", which \\"grapples with news that a past lover has met someone new, then laments other bygone relationships\\". Lorde recalled that she felt similar emotions, saying that the \\"moment you get out of the car, you are only going to get farther apart from each other\\". Antonoff stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that one of his proudest moments during the recording was placing a \\"synth at the end [of the song] that sounds like metal bending\\". During recording sessions, Antonoff recommended that Lorde take inspiration from Irish singer Sin√©ad O'Connor's voice. They also experimented with the enunciation of the phrase \\"hard feelings\\". Recording and lyrics Lorde recorded \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" at five different locations in the United States.

John Hanes mixed \\"Hard Feelings\\" at MixStar Studios, while Antonoff mixed \\"Loveless\\" at his home studio of Rough Customer Studios. Other personnel include Frank Dukes, who provided additional production to the song. \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" is composed in the key of B-flat major with a moderate groove tempo of 74 beats per minute. Lorde's vocals span a range of E3 to G4. The song has two different chord progressions, \\"Hard Feelings\\" follows a basic sequence of B‚ÄìE‚ÄìGm while \\"Loveless\\" follows a sequence of E‚ÄìCm‚ÄìA‚ÄìB. \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" is an \\"industrial-infused\\" song which has influences of other genres such as noise music, as well as the use of a distorted synthesizer in its production. Critics interpreted \\"Hard Feelings\\" as a song about the emotions of falling out of love, while \\"Loveless\\" discusses the \\"generational epidemic of love\\". Stacey Anderson from Pitchfork described the song as having a \\"creaky, atonal electronic rasp\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the production of \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" as infusing some \\"mixes with noise,\\" making \\"burbles and blotches of synthesizer distortion erupt on the edges\\" of the first song like the \\"psychic storm behind the song's attempts at a merciful breakup\\". Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic felt that the song's lyrics painted a \\"touching scene of her sitting in a car with a beau on the verge of splitting\\" ending the track with \\"I guess I should go.\\" Reception and promotion \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised its lyrics and experimental production. Entertainment Weekly writer Nolan Feeney said that Lorde showed a \\"winking self-awareness, taking the clich√© of the crazy ex-girlfriend\\" to extremes. Her persona was compared to Alex Forrest in the 1987 psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction. The Jakarta Post writer Stanley Widianto felt that \\"Hard Feelings\\" had \\"Melodramas most challenging moments\\". Pigeons and Planes and Vulture placed it in their Best Songs of the Week lists. Pretty Much Amazing called \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\" one of the \\"most ambitious pop songs\\" of the year, comparing its sound to West's work on his 2013 album Yeezus. Slant called the first part of the song a \\"happy surprise,\\" referring it as the \\"most shamelessly poppy track\\" she ever recorded. In a mixed-positive review, The Spinoff noted that while the contrast between both tracks was \\"obviously intentional,\\" it made an \\"ambiguous artistic statement\\" that the album did not pull off. Sharing similar sentiments, Spin writer, Anna Gaca commented that the track was \\"ragged\\" and a \\"two-faced puzzle that creaks through its experimental instrumental\\". Gaca further stated that the album's \\"weirder moments glint like diamonds in the rough,\\" and that there was something to love in every song, \\"even the misfortunate Loveless\\". Lorde performed \\"Hard Feelings/Loveless\\", with six other songs, as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of the album. It was also part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì2018). \\"Hard Feelings\\" was the third song Lorde played at her Manchester, United Kingdom date, while \\"Loveless\\" was the encore.

She co-wrote and co-produced the track with Jack Antonoff. It is a piano ballad with sparse production and an outro. Its lyrics are Lorde's lament to an ex-lover, in which she says she will always love him but she also needs to move her life forwards. The song received acclaim from music critics, many of whom commended its songwriting. Lorde performed \\"Writer in the Dark\\" and six other songs as part of a re- imagined Vevo song series at Electric Lady Studios, and was included on the set list of her Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì2018). Background and development Jack Antonoff co-wrote and co-produced the song. In an exclusive podcast interview with The Spinoff, Lorde stated that she wrote \\"Writer in the Dark\\" from the perspective of \\"something being finished, but still feeling like I had something I wanted to say\\". The singer said about the songwriting process, \\"It's interesting when you're female and you write this confessional, painfully honest music about your life. There's a lot of guilt associated with that.\\" In a separate interview with NME, the singer said she was inspired to write the lyric, \\"Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark\\" after she woke late one night in a bed she was sharing with a stranger. According to Lorde, the song is her way of saying, \\"It's what I've always been. It's what I was when you met me. It's what I will continue to be after you leave. That's exactly what was going to happen when you kissed a writer in the dark.\\" She also said the songwriting process felt therapeutic and complex. When asked about writing from a traditionalist perspective, the singer said she felt she made the song unique by implementing words such as \\"pseudoephedrine\\", the name of a sympathomimetic drug, which she said would work better in a hip hop song; she enjoyed taking standard forms and putting \\"spiky bits on them\\". The singer also compared \\"Writer in the Dark\\" and her 2017 song \\"Liability\\" to a rap cadence. Composition and lyrical interpretation \\"Writer in the Dark\\" was co-written and co-produced by Lorde (credited under her birth-name Ella Yelich-O'Connor) and Jack Antonoff. It was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, New York City. The song is composed in the key of G major with a walking pace tempo of 72 beats per minute while Lorde's vocals span a range of D3 to D5. It is a piano ballad with sparse instrumentation in its production. Its lyrics are Lorde's lament to an ex-lover, whom she tells she will always love but she also needs to move forward. Paste writer Emily Reily said the song \\"combines Lorde‚Äôs defiance with her most desperate and exposed moments.\\" The song drew comments on Lorde's vocals, which several publications compared to those of English singer Kate Bush. According to Colin Groundwater from Pretty Much Amazing, Lorde vocals on the line \\"I love you til you call the cops on me\\" stretch to a \\"painfully human falsetto\\", while Chicago Tribune editor Greg Kot said the singer delivers a \\"resonant line about obsession\\" as she finds a \\"way to tunnel out from the wreckage\\". Drowned in Sound noted a shift in Lorde's vocals from her \\"usual semi-growl of a delivery to a much more high-pitched warble\\", while Rolling Stone compared the track to a B-side from Bush's 1985 album Hounds of Love. Entertainment Weekly stated that Lorde acknowledges the \\"trope of the scorned lover\\" in the song, while No Ripcord said her vocals turn to grief in the lines, \\"I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops\\". Critical reception Lorde's vocals on \\"Writer in the Dark\\" were compared to those of Kate Bush (pictured in 1986). \\"Writer in the Dark\\" received critical acclaim from music critics; several publications compared its songwriting to the works of American musician Taylor Swift. Stuff.co.nz editor Graeme Tuckett called it one of the highlights from the album, saying, \\"Lorde giving her toughest and least inflected vocal performance in the service of the album's strongest set of lyrics\\". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian stated that while the song was not the first attempt from a modern female singer to channel Kate Bush, \\"it may well be the first one that doesn't make you want to die of embarrassment on their behalf. Sharing similar sentiments, Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic called the song a \\"wonderful nightmare of a piano piece\\" and concludes by stating that Lorde is saying \\"something that's been said many times before in song, but she's still saying it more interestingly than most people\\". DIY writer Will Richards called the song \\"flooring, showing her to be one of the most emotionally intelligent pop songwriters around\\", while NMEs Dan Stubbs described it as \\"deliciously bitter\\". Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared its lyrics to Swift and its aesthetic to American singer Lana Del Rey, saying it is \\"sometimes sparse and transparent enough to accompany Lorde's voice with just a piano note or two\\". \\"Writer in the Dark\\" was ranked by Entertainment Weekly 8th on their list of the Most Emotionally Devastating Songs of the 2010s. Eve Barlow, writing for the publication, called it \\"triumphant\\". Credits and personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Melodrama.

Lorde co-wrote the track with Jack Antonoff, both of whom also co-produced it with Joel Little, with additional production from Frank Dukes, Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel and Malay. It is a synth-pop and electropop song that draws influence from other genres, such as dance, electro house, electronica and new wave music. The lyrics are about Lorde reviewing her most joyful memories from a previous relationship and realizing the illusion is no longer present. Music critics praised the song, with many comparing its production to the works of American musician Bruce Springsteen and Swedish singer Robyn. The track's name, supercut, is a word coined by Andy Baio and is defined as a compilation of short video clips of the same type of action. \\"Supercut\\" was included in the soundtrack of the 2019 Netflix film Someone Great. It was one of six songs used as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios, where she recorded most of her album. \\"Supercut\\" was also part of the set list for the Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì2018). Background In an interview with The Spinoff, Lorde recalled leaving a party late at night and driving around Ponsonby Road in Auckland in a taxi listening to Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland. While driving, she heard music playing from nearby bars. Lorde wanted to feel as if one was \\"dancing through the walls of a party\\". The singer wrote the track with this concept in mind when she arrived to the United States. After recording \\"Supercut\\", she would play it as she left The Spotted Pig, a gastro pub in the West Village area of Lower Manhattan, after midnight. Despite not being credited as a recording location on the song's liner notes, the singer recorded the track at Jungle City. During takes, Lorde placed a microphone in the corner of the studio, stood away from it, and recorded her verses. She compared the end result to an answering machine or voice note. The pair constructed most of the track using drums and then \\"filled in the blanks\\" with a piano. Lorde called \\"Supercut\\" a \\"sister song\\" to \\"Ribs\\" from her 2013 debut album Pure Heroine. Recording and composition Jack Antonoff (pictured in 2012) co-wrote and co-produced \\"Supercut\\". Lorde recorded \\"Supercut\\" in three locations around the United States. She began recording at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, New York City, with assistance from Barry McCready and Jack Antonoff. Antonoff also worked with Lorde at Rough Customer Studio in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Recording concluded at Weslake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with assistance from Ben Sedano and Greg Eliason. Serban Ghenea mixed the song at MixStar Studios with assistance from engineer John Hanes. The track was mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound in New York. Other personnel include Joel Little, as well as Frank Dukes, Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel, Malay, who provided additional production to the song. \\"Supercut\\" is composed in the key of C Major with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Lorde's vocals span a range of A3 to E5 and its chord progression follows a basic sequence of C‚ÄìFsus2‚ÄìAm-F. It is a synth-pop and electropop song, which has influences of other genres such as dance, electro house, electronica, and new wave music. The track's lyrics recall Lorde's highlights from a previous relationship. \\"Supercut\\" features an interpolation of the piano melody from her 2017 single, \\"Green Light\\". According to Ava Muir of Exclaim, the track is driven by a \\"hauntingly infectious pulse\\". In an analysis of the album, Lindsay Zoladz from The Ringer said the song is associated in popular culture with the \\"relationship‚Äôs 'perfect' moments captured in cropped, filtered Instagrams that we flick through after they [are] over\\". Reception \\"Supercut\\" received critical acclaim from music critics, with many calling it a stand-out track on Melodrama. The track received comparisons to the works of American musician Bruce Springsteen and Swedish singer Robyn. Mike Neid from Idolator wrote that the track delivered \\"one of the most gracefully crafted lyrics on the album\\", and called it a \\"joyful release that offers a sliver of hope for new beginnings\\". Writing for The Independent, Roisin O'Connor praised the song's unusual \\"quirks\\" in its production, which help \\"expose the inner workings of her music\\". O'Connor also said Lorde \\"respects pop for what it is and what it is capable of\\". Chris Willman of Variety called it the album's \\"mini masterpiece\\". The track appeared in several music critics' year-end lists. Stereogum placed the song at number two on their year-end list, calling the lyrics \\"genius, the music a propulsive mirage\\" and the overall effect \\"overwhelming and tingly\\". Lindsay Zoladz from The Ringer also placed the song at number two on her list, describing it as \\"a precise distillation of the ways the internet shapes and warps how we experience life\\". NME included \\"Supercut\\" at number 29 on their year-end list, while Vulture ranked it at number four on their year-end list. Dee Lockett from the publication stated that the track was a \\"misshapen puzzle whose beauty is greater for its flaws.\\" Andy Baio, the person who coined \\"the term\\", praised Lorde for using it in her song. \\"Supercut\\" was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for exceeding 35,000 shipments. Live performances and other usage Norwegian pop punk quartet Sl√∏tface (pictured) performed a rendition of \\"Supercut\\" on radio station Triple J Lorde first performed \\"Supercut\\", along with two other tracks, at the Bowery Auditorium in New York City on the night of the singer's Melodrama album release party. She also performed the track on 1Live, which was described as \\"breathtaking\\" and emotional. \\"Supercut\\" was one of six songs Lorde performed as part of a re- imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album. For the Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì18), Lorde performed \\"Supercut\\" after her last costume change and a video interlude. It was the first track she performed from the prelude of the show's third and final segment, which was composed of five songs. Norwegian pop punk band Sl√∏tface covered the song at Australian radio station Triple J; Consequence of Sound described the cover as \\"cleaned up from the dance floor while forfeiting none of its emotional core\\". Sl√∏tface's cover replaces the electronics of the production with a \\"reverberating guitar\\". Lorde responded to the group's cover, calling it \\"rad\\". It was included in the official soundtrack for the video game FIFA 18; NME described the track as \\"the one\\" and called it one of the soundtrack's \\"killer tunes\\". The song was also featured in the soundtrack for the 2019 Netflix film Someone Great; director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson stated in an interview with Rolling Stone that \\"Supercut\\" was a source of inspiration while developing the film's screenplay. As a result, she wrote the song into the film's script before \\"any of the people in the movie existed\\". El-P remix Lorde posted a tweet on 27 February 2018 that a \\"small surprise\\" would be sent to fans who subscribed to her newsletter. The following day, a remix of the song titled \\"Supercut (El-P Remix)\\", produced by El-P of the hip hop group Run the Jewels, was released via email. Talking about the remix, Lorde said, \\"I love it. So much. My little nerd heart is full.\\" Initially made available for free download to commemorate the arrival of her North American tour, the remix was released to streaming services worldwide on 9 March 2018. \\"Supercut (El-P Remix)\\" was described as a trip hop track with bass and synthesizer production. The remix features vocals from Lorde and rap verses from Killer Mike and El-P that deliver observations on society and the portrayal of enemies. It received positive reviews from music critics, with some praising the duo for adding a darker melody to the original upbeat composition. Stereogum writer Claymore Tully noted that the remix's slower tempo turned the \\"fairly upbeat, dance-ready track\\" into a \\"sludgy slow-burner\\". Eric Skelton of Pigeons and Planes lauded Mike and El-P's \\"high-energy\\" verses, stating that the remix \\"was made with large arenas in mind.\\" It charted at number nine on the New Zealand Heatseekers chart.

The neighborhood was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  History  The Federal Copper Company operated a smelter in the area that would later become Manhattan Heights between June 9, 1899 and December 1, 1908. The smelter was designed by architects, Buchanan and Allen, and ore processing began on September 10, 1901. The copper company's smelter was demolished by 1912 to make way for a residential area. On October 12, 1912, the area was sold to a dentist, Dr. James B. Brady for $85,000. The first home was built in 1914, and most homes were completed by the 1930s. The homes were designed with wealthy buyers in mind. In 1976, residents formed the Memorial Park Improvement Association (MPIA), to help restore the neighborhood. Kenneth Bailey, Una Hill, Mary Wilson, Louis Cantwell, Mary Neil Brown and Sandra Davis were all involved with getting Manhattan Heights designated a historic neighborhood on June 9, 1979. It was the first neighborhood in El Paso to receive that distinction. Because of the historic status of the neighborhood, efforts to preserve old homes have been undertaken by the El Paso Historic Preservation Alliance.  Cityscape  The boundaries of Manhattan Heights are made up by Memorial Park, Piedras Road, Copia Street and Louisville. Architecture in Manhattan Heights includes buildings that represent Georgian Revival, Foursquare, Tudor, American bungalows and Spanish-Italian architectural influences. In 1927, the first woman architect in El Paso and second in Texas, Mabel Welch, built her first home in the Manhattan Heights neighborhood. Welch started the trend of Spanish revival in the area.  Education  Manhattan Heights School, later renamed Crockett Elementary School, was established in 1919. The name change took place in order to honor heroes from Texas and happened on May 8, 1922. The area is served by the Memorial Park Branch of the El Paso Public Library system.  Parks and recreation  Veterans Memorial Park was set aside by the city of El Paso on May 13, 1920. The park is a war memorial and \\"desert oasis\\" designed primarily by landscape architect, George Kessler. Roses in the El Paso Municipal Rose Garden. Another park in the area is the Municipal Rose Garden, which was opened in May 1959. The rose garden showcases over 430 varieties of roses and 1,500 individual rose buses. The roses growing in the garden are representative of types that grow best in El Paso's desert climate. The garden is about 4-acres in size. The garden has been maintained by El Paso Master Gardeners since 2007, who work as volunteers. There garden is multi- level and also includes waterfalls and a koi pond. The garden is open seasonally, from the beginning of March until the end of November. It is located on North Copia street and has free admission. Prior to the Rose garden, there was several different gardens on the site which were known as the Hill Top Gardens Area and opened in 1933. The rock wall seats of the garden were part of a Civil Works Administration project and the gardens were completed by 1935. The Hill Top Gardens won a Better Homes and Gardens contest in 1938.

Flowering plants have three to five bright green leaves at the base of the flowering stem and a single green and white, sickle-shaped flower. Description Pterostylis lustra is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Flowering plants have between three and five bright green, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves in a loose group at base of the flowering stem, each leaf 20‚Äì60 mm long and 8‚Äì15 mm wide. A single flower 30‚Äì50 mm long and 20‚Äì27 mm wide is borne on a spike 80‚Äì200 mm high. The flowers are green, white and sickle-shaped. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column but the dorsal sepal is longer than the petals and tapers to a point. The lateral sepals are erect with a gap between them and the galea, have thread- like tips 20-30mm long and there is a broad notch in the sinus between them. The labellum is dark-coloured, blunt, 15‚Äì25 mm long, about 3 mm wide and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from late October to February. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis lustra was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Wilsons Promontory National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (lustra) is a Latin word meaning \\"illuminate\\" or \\"light up\\". Distribution and habitat The small sickle greenhood is locally common in the southern half of Victoria where it grows in wet, swampy areas under Leptospermum lanigerum. It also occurs in northern Tasmania and in the south- east of South Australia. Conservation Pterostylis lustra is classified as \\"endangered' under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

The series revolves around the student life of several characters who, due to circumstances of life, could never finish their dreams of having graduated from university, so everyone ends up attending Graham University, a night university where each of the characters will fulfill their dreams with the help of Esther (Marcela Carvajal) and Mario (Jorge Enrique Abello). On 3 February 2018, Caracol Televisi√≥n confirmed that the series would be renewed for a second season. The production of the second season began in September 2019, and it premiered on 7 January 2020.  Synopsis  = Season 1 (2017) = The series revolves around millions of students in the world who turn to night education as the only way to get ahead. They will be represented by Amelia (Carolina Acevedo), Muriel (Jimena Dur√°), Luis Herney (Jos√© Daniel Cristancho), Faber (Jimmy V√°squez), Ingrid (Yuri Vargas), Germ√°n (Ernesto Ball√©n), Alejandro (Manuel Prieto) and Do√±a Pilar (Consuelo Luzardo), who study a technical career at Graham University, with the illusion of fulfilling the dream of obtaining an academic degree that opens the doors in the labor market to improve their quality of life. These eight characters will find countless obstacles, personal and professional, that will test their ability to get ahead in the midst of family, work and economic obligations that they must overcome if they want to become future business managers. Amelia, mother and wife; Muriel, a former secretary; Luis Herney, former convict who works in a workshop; Germ√°n, a peasant boy newly arrived in the city; Faber and Ingrid, two chefs who dream of creating their own restaurant and Do√±a Pilar, a woman of almost 70 years. They will meet every night in a classroom with the conviction that it is never too late to start over. = Season 2 (2020) = Mario (Jorge Enrique Abello) and Esther (Marcela Carvajal) return to La Graham another year to complete a new semester in which they plan to inaugurate a new career: Law. In the classrooms, the lives of seven students will be crossed: Don Mariano (C√©sar Mora), a retired accountant who feels that it is never too late to fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer; Alberto (Juan Pablo Llano), escort of an important magistrate; Margarita (Marianne Schaller), mother and wife who wants to show that she can also be a great professional. El Tanque (Jaisson Jeack), a soccer player in the twilight of his career; Valery (Rosmeri Marval), an immigrant who arrives in the country in search of new opportunities; Karen (Michelle Orozco), a young woman who wants to do justice, and Cristian (Brian Moreno), a millennial who sees in Law the opportunity to earn money. In a country that tops the list with the largest number of lawyers in the world, La Graham students and professors will overcome personal, work and economic obstacles, with the dream of graduating from professionals who can improve justice that is not always favorable.

Endemic to New Zealand, it lives underground and is rarely seen. It is now restricted to parts of the southern North Island.  Taxonomy  The mole cricket was well known to MƒÅori, who encountered it when cultivating garden plots and called it honi. Mole crickets collected in New Zealand were assumed to be the European species Gryllotalpa vulgaris (a synonym of Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa), which has a wingless nymph that resembles the adult New Zealand species. Triamescaptor aotea was named and described by Norman Tindale in 1928 from two specimens collected in 1915 at Aramoho, Whanganui. It is the only species in its genus, and the only genus in tribe Triamescaptorini. Its closest relatives are two Australian species of Gryllotalpa. Triamescaptor is sometimes incorrectly spelled \\"Trimescaptor\\" in later publications.  Description  Whanganui. Foreleg of a New Zealand mole cricket (Triamescaptor aotea) showing the two movable and one fixed dactyls used for digging. Triamescaptor aotea is long, and medium to dark brown in colour, with distinct protruding antennae and long rear processes (or cerci). Its rear cerci are sensory, and in its tunnel it is able to move backwards as easily as forwards. The first segment of its thorax is extended, rounded, and armoured. Its front legs are heavily modified for digging, flattened and shovel-like, with just three claw-like processes or dactyls on its tibia (Gryllotalpa has four), two movable and one fixed. The New Zealand mole cricket, unlike other species of Gryllotalpidae, has no wings, not even vestiges. Because mole crickets produce sound by stridulation of their wings, this species is necessarily silent and lacks the ears other species have on their front tibia. Any winged mole crickets found in New Zealand are likely to be introduced European Gryllotalpa, with which the New Zealand species has sometimes been confused.  Ecology  New Zealand mole crickets live underground, in circular galleries roughly in diameter and below the surface. Females lay clutches of eggs in side chambers off the gallery and guard them until they hatch. They are omnivorous, feeding on the roots of plants and other burrowing insects such as grass grubs (Costelytra zealandica) and porina moth caterpillars (Wiseana). During rain or flooding mole crickets emerge from their burrows to feed; they have been recovered from the stomachs of eels at Lake Pounui in the Wairarapa, which forage in flooded paddocks at night.  Distribution  Because it lives underground this species is vulnerable to agricultural cultivation. Formerly widespread, it now seems to be localised to parts of the lower North Island, including Hawke's Bay, Whanganui, near Levin, Lake Wairarapa and Lake Pounui, and on D'Urville Island. It is probably also eaten by introduced rats. The Department of Conservation considers the species at risk because it is naturally uncommon.

A Democrat, Robinette agreed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and was one of the leading opponents within Virginia of the powerful Byrd Organization, who U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd called \\"anti's\\".Ronald L. Heinemann, Harry Byrd of Virginia (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1996) p. 263 Robinette represented his native Lee County, Virginia and adjacent Scott County for nearly two decades in the Virginia Senate, until his suicide days before the 1951 election. Early and family life Lloyd Robinette was born in Blackwater, Virginia to Narcissa Lindsey Robinette (1850-1892), and her husband, former Confederate veteran Samuel R. Robinette (1839-1926). His father had served in Company B of the 25th Virginia Cavalry before being captured in 1864 and imprisoned in Indiana until the end of the American Civil War. Although his mother was born in Illinois, her family descended from Irish emigrants to Bedford County, Virginia centuries before; his parents met and married in Tennessee in 1870. His father's ancestors had been Huguenots who fled France to Bavaria, then England before emigrating to Pennsylvania and eventually southwestern Virginia. Lloyd Robinette was eligible for membership in the Sons of the American Revolution on both sides of his family, but instead chose to participate in the Sons of Confederate Veterans, eventually leading the William E. Jones Camp. His seven siblings included older brother Charles J. Robinette (1875-1925), younger brothers Lewis Emerson Robinette (1883-1946) and Amos Oscar Robinette (1891-1971), as well as sisters Mary Robinette (b. 1872), Sarah Caldona Robinette Livingston (1877-1918), Ida May Robinette (1885-1909) and Lilie B. Robinette (b. 1887). Lloyd Robinette was educated in the public schools and Jonesville Academy before attending Roanoke College, where he was editor-in-chief of the Roanoke Collegian (among other journalistic and social endeavors) and received an A.B. degree in 1906. He then studied law at the University of Virginia School of Law, where he was a member of Phi Alpha Delta and his high grades earned membership in the Order of the Coif before he graduated with an LLB degree in 1909.E.

Career Before completing his formal education, Robinette taught for five years in the local Lee County public schools. After graduating from law school and admission to the Virginia bar, Robinette remained in Charlottesville as an instructor in law from 1909-1911. He returned to Lee County and served as commissioner of accounts (probate) before voters elected him as Commonwealth Attorney (prosecutor), in which capacity he served from 1921 until 1924. He then returned to his private legal practice. Robinette was also active in the Masons, helped collect funds for the U.S. armed forces during both World Wars, and also served as chairman of the local Red Cross Chapter. Lee and Scott County voters elected Robinette to the Virginia Senate in 1931, where he succeeded Republican Ryland G. Craft.

One of the leading representatives of political anti-Semitism in the German Empire, he was elected a member of the Reichstag three times. Zimmermann, a Roman Catholic, was educated at the gymnasium in Ohlau before studying at Breslau University and Leipzig University.Zimmermann, Oswald, geb. am 05 . 02 . 1859 in Neumarkt in Schlesien Working in Dresden, he was editor-in-chief of the journal Deutsche Reform before later establishing his own journal Deutsche Wacht. He also published Sind die Juden noch das auserw√§hlte Volk? Ein Beitrag zur Aufkl√§rung √ºber die Judenfrage. Zimmermann was active in the original German Reform Party, a strong anti-Semitic group active in Saxony between 1880 and 1891.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 22 When this party disappeared he developed his own group of followers and with them worked closely with Otto B√∂ckel, with both men combining their followings as a new German Reform Party in 1893.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 39 He was elected to the Reichstag as one of a number of independent anti-Semites in 1890 and held the seat for the German Reform Party in 1893.Datenbank der deutschen Parlamentsabgeordneten Zimmermann pressed for closer links with another anti-Semitic party, the German Social Party, and, despite the reservations of B√∂ckel, they merged in 1894 as the German Social Reform Party.Robert Melson, Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust, University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 118 Despite the initiative being largely his idea Zimmermann found working with the German Social Party, who represented the more moderate end of the independent anti-Semitic movement, difficult and in particular clashed with their leader Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, whom he personally disliked. Both men came to command their own factions within the party and, with B√∂ckel having already left, the joint party proved highly unstable. The two groups split again in 1900 with Zimmermann reactivating the German Reform Party for a third time.Walther Killy (ed.), Dictionary of German Biography: Thibaut - Zycha, Volume 10, Walter de Gruyter, 2006, p. 705 He returned to the Reichstag representing this party in the 1907 election, holding the seat until his death in 1910.

It was named after Robert F. Stockton who owned a mine and stamp mill during the California Gold Rush. An impoundment on the creek owned by the Mariposa Public Utilities Commission holds a major source of water for the community of Mariposa. The source of the creek is near Midpines Summit. Its confluence with Mariposa Creek is near the Mariposa County Fairgrounds. History In 1850, Commodore Stockton invested in a mine and leased land from his former subordinate during the Mexican War, John Fremont. Fremont had acquired all of the surrounding area as part of the Las Mariposas Land Grant. Stockton formed a partnership with William Aspinwall and in April 1850 they hired Edward Beale to supervise the transport of a steam-powered rock crushing apparatus to be installed at their mine on the creek. After successfully supervising the installation of the stamp mill Beale returned to the east coast, but then was reassigned by Stockton and Aspinwall to go back to California to inspect the mine's viability, which he found to be not profitable. However it was on this trip that Beale assessed the need to build a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama, which became a major operation for Aspinwall. Aspinwall and Stockton sold their interests in the Stockton Creek Mine and the associated Stockton Creek Tunnel. The mine operated sporadically until 1938. Its principal period of productivity was from 1900 to 1915. The mouth of Stockton Creek was, and still is, an area of general commercial development. Known as Mormon Bar, there were hard rock mines, placer claims, and a stockyard during the gold rush. A sand and gravel company operated at Mormon bar in the mid 20th century, using mostly dredge tailings as a material source. The Mariposa County Fairgrounds are located at Mormon Bar. Watershed Mariposa County contains three major drainage basins: the Merced River, Chowchilla River/Fresno River, and a localized cluster of streams of the east valley known as the Lower Mariposa group of streams. These three basins and their component watersheds are part of the much larger San Joaquin River system that drains the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. At the lower end of the watershed, Mariposa Creek is dammed by the Mariposa Creek Dam ( high). The Mariposa Public Utilities District (MPUD) operates the Stockton Creek Dam ( tall) on Stockton Creek. Stockton Creek Preserve In 2011 areas around the reservoir were set aside for public use in a joint project of the Sierra Foothill Conservancy and the Mariposa Public Utilities District known as the Stockton Creek Preserve. Stockton Creek Reservoir provides water to Mariposa, and the preserve was set aside in order to better protect the natural surroundings for watershed protection, and also for public enjoyment of the area. The preserve is 410 acres, and is accessible via trail easements across private property.

All three songs were written by Adam Ant, and were early fan favorites among 'Antpeople'. \\"Friends\\" and \\"Physical\\" were performed at a John Peel session on 10 July 1978. All three tracks had previously been recorded in 1978 for the Ants' first label Decca Records. \\"Kick\\" at RAK Studios in Chalbert Street, London, produced by Snips, \\"Friends\\" and \\"Physical\\" at Decca's own studio at Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead, produced by Ant himself. Antmusic EP All three tracks were recorded during the Dirk Wears White Sox recording session at Sound Development Studios in August 1979; none were used on the album. Following the departure of all three sidemen with manager Malcolm McLaren to form Bow Wow Wow in January 1980, Do It Records intended to release the tracks on the Antmusic EP in early 1980 to complete the contract of the seemingly defunct band. However Adam quickly proved the survival of the band with a new line-up. The songs \\"Cartrouble\\" (Pt. 2) and \\"Kick\\" along with new lyrics added, were re-recorded with new guitarist Marco Pirroni and guest drummer Jon Moss. With the contract thus fulfilled Adam and the Ants and Do It Records parted ways,after releasing the single \\"Kick\\". Soon afterwards Adam and the Ants signed with CBS Records and achieved massive commercial success with the album Kings of the Wild Frontier. Released in late 1980, it was the UK number one selling album in 1981, and the 48th best seller of 1980. It was named the Best British Album at the 1982 Brit Awards. As the band's popularity peaked in Britain, Do It decided to cash in on their success by releasing the Antmusic EP, consisting of \\"Friends\\" b/w \\"Kick\\"/\\"Physical\\" as a 7\\" single in 1982, along with a 12\\" version also featuring remixes of the original album versions of \\"Cartrouble\\" parts 1 and 2. Chronologically the single followed \\"Deutscher Girls\\", which was also an old track released by a former label (E.G. Records). It reached number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. B-sides Cleaner, more polished versions of three songs had already been released as B-sides to previous Adam and the Ants singles. \\"Friends\\" was the B-side of \\"Ant Rap\\", \\"Kick\\", with completely different lyrics, was the B-side of \\"Cartrouble\\", and \\"Physical\\" was renamed \\"Physical (You're So)\\" when it appeared on the B-side of \\"Dog Eat Dog\\". The version of \\"Physical\\" that appears on this single appeared on the B-side of a July 1980 pressing of 2000 copies of the \\"Zerox\\" single, though \\"Whip in My Valise\\" was still credited. \\"Friends\\" lyrics In \\"Friends\\", Adam does a considerable amount of name dropping, among the people sited as friends include Shirley Bassey, former Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe, Mr. Spock, Michael Caine, John Wayne, Stevie Wonder, Eric Fromm and Bryan Ferry.

His chance encounter with a generous member of the Jesuit China missions greatly expanded Korean knowledge of western science, technology, geographical knowledge, and culture centuries before it opened its borders to actual visitors from abroad. Life During a diplomatic mission to the Ming in Beijing in early 1631, Jeong stopped at Dengzhou (now Penglai) on the northern coast of Shandong. The normal route was overland, but the Koreans were obliged to travel directly across the Yellow Sea owing to the northern war zones created by the initial phases of the Manchu conquest of China. There, he met with the province's Christian governor under the Ming Ignatius Sun, who introduced him to the Jesuit interpreter Jo√£o Rodrigues. Rodrigues was working with Gon√ßalo Teixeira-Correa to train Sun's forces in the use of European-style cannon. He made a personal gift of his telescope to Jeong, which became the first such device known in Korea. He also laded Jeong down with Jesuit texts on astronomy and other sciences including Alenio's Record of Foreign Lands (, Chikpang Oegi); a treatise on artillery and its use; and a guide to European customs and manners, as well as works on Christianity. Despite also receiving some European firearm, Jeong praised the telescope most highly, as he understood its importance for warfare. He also had his assistants Yi Yeonghu (, ) and Colonel Jeong Hyogil (, ) speak with Rodrigues in greater detail, Yi about geography and Col. Jeong about Western firearms and cannon. A record survives of Yi's conversation. He was most curious about whether or not China‚Äîwhose native name Zh≈çnggu√≥ () literally means \\"The Central Realm\\"‚Äîdid in fact occupy the middle of the earth. Rodrigues replied that, since the earth was a sphere, every country could truthfully claim their land as its center. Legacy Yi Sugwang had accumulated enough material from the Jesuits during his own diplomatic visits in the 1590s that he was able to compile the encyclopedic Jibong Yuseol. Another diplomat returned with a copy of Ricci's world map in 1603. Nonetheless, the additional material provided to Jeong has still been credited with the full-scale introduction of Western astronomical methods and jurisprudence to Korea. Jeong's mission is still taught to Korean schoolchildren as the country's introduction to Western science, religion, and culture.

In southeastern Nigeria, Mmirioku (Hot water) \\"spring\\" in Akiyi-Umulokpa is geothermal manifestation that has received little or no attention. The spring has the temperature between 39-49¬∞C which was drilled over 40 years ago. Umulokpa is predominantly rural and agrarian. The town has rich agricultural lands as a result of its location within the tropical rainforest and savannah belt; Over 85% of the population are farmers growing food crops such as rice, cassava, maize, yam, black bean, banana, plantain, etc. and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Cash crops grown include oil palm, pineapple, cashew, orange, mangoes and irvingia gabonensis (ogbono), they are also produced in large quantities. Excellent climatic conditions exist for poultry, piggery, goat, sheep and other livestock productions. The major market in Umulokpa is the \\"Eke Akiyi\\" Market. Various farm products are traded in the market on wholesale and retail basis every four days. Many of the people take their farm produce to sell in the market in exchange for other commodities they cannot produce. People from the neighbouring towns including Onitsha and Enugu urban also patronize the traders in this market especially for cassava flakes (garri), palm oil, plantain and vegetables.  Brief History  Umulokpa became the headquarters of Uzo-Uwani Rural District Council (RDC) also known as \\"County Council\\" in 1951. At the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970, the East Central State government embarked on the re-organization of the local government system in the area. The outcome was the introduction of a local government system known as the Divisional Administration Department (DAD), which was a fusion of divisional administration and government field administration. The state was carved into 35 divisions and 640 community councils. The system sought to integrate indigenous social community organizations into the state administrative framework. In 1976, Local Government Reform which coincided with the creation of new states in which Nigeria was divided into nineteen states, Umulokpa remained the Headquarters of Uzo-Uwani LGA as Nigeria's primary objective of the reform programme was to update the existing local government structure and to bring it in line with what was obtainable elsewhere, as well as to bring about uniformity in the country‚Äôs local government administration under the then first Military Governor of old Anambra state Lieutenant Colonel John Atom Kpera and military head of state for Nigeria General Olusegun Obasanjo at the time Anambra State was created from the old East Central State of Nigeria. The town is known for hospitality and, it's called the food-basket due to its agrarian nature. Umulokpa is closely related to Olo. There was a story of a man called Okpala Ndim, who had two sons. The elder known as Awuke (Olo) and the younger called Awuga or Awuja. The Awuga's son called Okpandi (Okpandim) founded Umulokpa. Umulokpa and Olo were known as Umundim ‚Äì Umulokpandim/Olondim. They live closely to each other. Umulokpa lived along the stretch of the Duu riverside (Ezu river) centuries ago in the present day Olo, Ezeagu LGA but crossed over the Duu river to the present day Umulokpa, Uzo-Uwani LGA when one hunter/farmer from Nkwelle Village discovered the modern day Umulokpa land as a fertile ground for Agriculture and, advised his kith and kin to come along with him which they did and, established their home in this modern day Umulokpa community many centuries ago. Today, Amagu Obinuno village or town of Umulokpa is in Ezeagu LGA because they did not go with their kith and kit to the present-day Umulokpa which is the Headquarters of Uzo-Uwani LGA. Government in Nigeria uses river and sea mostly as boundaries. In the case of Umulokpa which is the headquarters of Uzo-Uwani LGA, the Duu river was used as the boundary between Ezeagu and Uzo-Uwani LGAs, of which Olo and Amagu Obinuno of Umulokpa are in Ezeagu LGA and Umulokpa is in Uzo-Uwani LGA. They are brothers but in different local government areas in Nigeria.  Religion  Prior to the coming of Europeans, Umulokpa people practiced traditional religion with the worship of various deities like other Igbo people. However, they had since embraced Christianity about a century ago. Today, there are more than 90% Christians in the town. The major Christian faiths are the Catholic which its current church building was built in 1923 and Anglican denominations. Some other churches, especially of the Pentecostal faith, have emerged in Umulokpa in the past forty years.

Running through portions of Franklin and Somerset counties, it connects SR 43 in the town of Industry with Madison at U.S. Route 201 (US 201). Route description SR 148 begins at a stop-controlled intersection with SR 43 at Goodrich Corner, a rural settlement within the town of Industry. The road heads north mostly through forested areas though it skirts the easterly edges of small hills and passes to the east of Clearwater Pond. After passing a small farm with numerous work buildings, SR 148 makes a 90-degree bend to head east to the settlement of West Mills. Continuing east, the highway briefly enters the town of Starks in Somerset County and curves to the north. It briefly reenters Industry, Franklin County before curving back to the east to cross Lemon Creek and into Anson, Somerset County. It continues traveling through mostly wooded areas before reaching the settlement of Five Points where it intersects and forms a concurrency with SR 43 towards downtown Anson. The two routes enter the more urbanized area of Anson on Main Street passing a post office and the town hall before curving to the north at Kennebec River. The road reaches an intersection with US 201A and SR 8; at this point, the four routes cross the river into Madison. After crossing the river, Main Street, carrying the four numbered routes, passes a factory, crosses a railroad, and enters the central business district of Madison. After passing numerous restaurants, offices, and churches, Main Street reaches an intersection with Weston Avenue and Old Point Avenue. US 201A and SR 8 head south along Old Point Avenue, SR 43 heads north along Weston Avenue, while SR 148 continues east along Main Street.

It is operated by and carries a toll of 75 pesos per car and 37 pesos per motorcycle. History In 2012, ICA, member of the consortium Controladora de Operaciones de Infraestructura, S.A. de C.V., obtained a 30-year concession for the highway from Palmillas to Apaseo el Grande. This project was conceived in order to connect the Baj√≠o region, home of an increasing number of industrial parks that generate truck traffic, to Mexico City without traversing Quer√©taro City and in less time; it was also considered the third-most important highway project of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto's presidency and the most important for central Mexico. Construction began in April 2013; while originally planned for completion in 2015, the road faced delays due to difficulties acquiring the road's right-of-way as well as with funding from the federal government and the higher cost of materials due to the weakness of the Mexican peso. On May 15, 2017, the SCT announced that the highway was complete; it cost 5.755 billion pesos to build. Three days later, President Pe√±a Nieto visited San Juan del R√≠o to formally inaugurate the new highway. It is expected to carry 15,000 to 17,000 cars a day, reducing the load on Mexican Federal Highway 57D which carries 60,000 vehicles a day. From May 22 to May 26, Caminos y Puentes Federales charged a discounted \\"promotional\\" toll on the road in order to recover lost revenues from traffic loss on Highway 57D until ICA took over operation of the toll booths on May 27. While the highway's mainline is complete, work is still in progress to build the road's nine interchanges and auxiliary toll booths that will connect the bypass to towns such as Amealco and Huimilpan. In addition to nine interchanges, the highway also features 23 underpasses, nine overpasses and 15 bridges. Route description The four-lane Macrolibramiento Palmillas-Apaseo el Grande passes through six municipalities, four in Quer√©taro and two in Guanajuato. The road begins at an interchange with Mexican Federal Highway 45; shortly thereafter traffic headed for Celaya from Mexico City splits off from Mexican Federal Highway 57D at Palmillas, and immediately after is a full cloverleaf with Mexican Federal Highway 57, leading to Atlacomulco, State of Mexico, to the south. Two interchanges serve Amealco, including one with Mexican Federal Highway 120 at kilometer 31. At kilometer 46 is an exit serving Huimilpan. After the interchange to Coroneo at kilometer 63, the highway crosses from Quer√©taro into Guanajuato in Apaseo el Alto, where it boasts an interchange with Mexican Federal Highway 45; the mainline ends at Highway 45D in Apaseo el Grande.

He is best known for his photographs of landscape and rural scenes produced during the 1920s and '30s. Early life Chance was born on 15 May 1885, in Liverpool, England.Early New Zealand Photographers He took his first photographs at the age of 12, with a three-penny pinhole camera.Hardwicke Knight, Photography in New Zealand: A Social and Technical History. John McIndoe, Ltd., 1971., p.99 Later, his father would give him a Thornton-Pickard half-plate camera. In 1901, the young Chance joined Houghtons Limited, a photography supplier, as a showroom demonstrator. His next job was as a photography tutor for The London Stereoscopic Company of Regent Street, around 1904. In this position he taught photography to a number of notable figures of the time, including Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Francis Greville, 5th Earl of Warwick, Prince Vajiravudh (then the Crown Prince of Siam), Lord Curzon, Lord Roberts and W.S. Gilbert. In 1905, Chance was the photographer on an ill-fated expedition to recover the Cocos Island Treasure, which apparently led to him being present for an unspecified \\"revolution\\" in Ecuador as well as an earthquake, events which supplied him with a supply of adventurous anecdotes later in his life.Hardwicke Knight, Photography in New Zealand: A Social and Technical History. John McIndoe, Ltd., 1971., p.100 Career Chance emigrated to New Zealand in 1909, by which time he was a qualified optometrist, and was employed by Dawson's Limited of Dunedin. He became the president of the Dunedin Optical Association in 1913, and joined the Dunedin Photographic Society in 1917. By 1919, Chance was exhibiting his photographs to some critical success, and continued to build his practice over the following decades, eventually going on to become a household name in New Zealand. Chance claimed at one point to have sold over 30,000 photographs both within New Zealand and overseas.Hardwicke Knight, Photography in New Zealand: A Social and Technical History. John McIndoe, Ltd., 1971., p.101 Style Chance was amongst the first photographers to import pictorialism to New Zealand, after being influenced by the work of Alfred Horsley Hinton and the Linked Ring group. Chance's photographic style is in keeping with the pictorialist ethos, which sought to elevate photography to the status of fine art by adopting a deliberately \\"painterly\\" technique and subject matter. Many of his works contain trees, a subject for which he had a special fondness. In addition to landscapes, Chance also photographed scenes of rural life, portraits and architectural subjects in Dunedin and Christchurch. Legacy Chance's work is significant because it represents an early example of New Zealand photography being treated as fine art;Bowerbank Ninow Artist Database, George Chance prior to the turn of the century, photographers such as the Burton Brothers and George Valentine mainly produced images as souvenirs for the tourist trade or as family keepsakes, not as art objects in their own right.

He was the son of Frederik Rasmussen and Anne Jacobsdatter. Paludan was married three times. He first married Margrethe Garmann in 1732, but she died in 1742. Then he married Johanne Fischer in 1743, and she died in 1754. He finally married Anna Margrethe Pohlmann in 1755 and they were married for about four years until his death on 8 January 1759. Over his lifetime, he fathered many children. Education and career He attended Christiania Cathedral School until 1720. Then he completed his postgraduate studies at the University of Copenhagen from April 1720 until December 1721. After this, he was a teacher for several years until he was ordained by the Bishop Bartholom√¶us Deichman in 1730 and began working as a priest in Christiania. From 1740 to 1743 he worked as a priest in the town of Stege, Denmark, as well as the dean for the whole island of M√∏n. In 1743, he became the dean of Christiania. In 1751, he was appointed to be the Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand. When Paludan took over the bishop's seat in Christianssand, he was surprised at how many beggars and poor people there were in the diocese. The conditions were much worse than in Akershus, where he came from. Together with the county administrator Fredrik Georg Adeler, he began to work for a more effective poverty relief, but this was not easy. There was great poverty, both in rural areas and towns, both at the sea and up in the mountainous areas. On his first visit, Paludan spoke to the most powerful and richest men in every parish about helping the poor. He wanted to bring the poor people onto the farms so they could get work. Paludan's work, however, did not lead to any positive improvements during his time as bishop. He served in this position until his death in 1759.

Reception  In the late 1930s the work of Otto Neurath and his method of picture statistics, the \\"Vienna method,\\" had come into prominence, and with it Modley was a rising star. In his famous 1937 thesis Howard G. Funkhouser had stipulated Otto Neurath and the Vienna Method, as follows: :\\"The Vienna Method of Picture Statistics. - The most rapidly growing system of graphic representation with the drive of vigorous propaganda behind it is the \\"Vienna method\\" recently developed by its active exponent, Dr. OTTO NEURATH, formerly of Vienna. Dr. NEURATH'S chief contribution to the phase of the graphic method known as picture statistics has been the development of a standard symbolism for the pictures and hieroglyphs suggested and used by earlier writers, chiefly BRINTON, HASKELL and KARSTEN.\\"H. Gray Funkhouser. \\"Historical development of the graphical representation of statistical data.\\" in: Osiris, Vol 3: 269-404. 1937. p. 350. Although Funkhouser didn't call Modley by name, he did refer to his company Pictorial Statistics, Inc. with the text: :\\"Aided by the work of NEURATH and his associates but separated from the basic theory and philosophy which characterizes their use by NEURATH, picture statistics are growing in favor with busi- ness organizations and others who desire to present statistics in a popular manner. An organization has been formed recently in the United States for the purpose of supplying this type of graphic material.\\"Funkhouser (1937, 351).

Born in Beverly, Massachusetts, Quiner was the daughter of Abraham Quiner, Jr. and Susannah Camell.http://www.beverlyma.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FAMOUS-BEVERLY- BURIALS.pdf For much of her early life she worked as a seamstress, both in her hometown and in nearby Salem; she did some upholstery for the family of Theodore Parker, and came to admire his views. In 1838 she took a position in the household of Seth Bass, librarian of the Boston Athenaeum. She lived in the Athenaeum building with the Bass family; sculptor Shobal Vail Clevenger kept studio space there, and she would observe him at work. One day she borrowed some of Clevenger's clay and crafted a likeness of Seth Bass that was of such quality that he encouraged her to continue her art. She was forty-two at the time. She exhibited work at the Athenaeum in 1846‚Äì48, and in 1847 worked there briefly as a gallery attendant in the Orpheus Room, but ill health combined with financial pressures caused her to give up sculpting and return to sewing in her last years. Quiner died either at her sister's residence in Lynn or in her hometown of Beverly, and is buried in the Central Cemetery in Beverly. A laudatory notice appeared in the Beverly Citizen around the time of her death. Quiner appears to have worked exclusively in plaster during her career. Her best-known work is a portrait of Robert Rantoul, cast in plaster and presented to the Athenaeum in 1842; it was the first sculpture by a woman to be shown there when it was exhibited in 1846. She also crafted portrait busts of Fitch Poole, Alonzo Lewis, William H. Lovett, Andrew Thorndike, and James Frothingham, whose own portrait of the sculptor is held by the Beverly Public Library. In the Beverly Historical Society collection are portrait busts of the artist's father and of Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford, a good friend. Hanaford wrote a biographical sketch of Quiner, and also penned two sonnets inspired by her and her work.

In the United States, such policies are typically aimed at improving the status of African-Americans. Many different kinds of race- conscious policies exist, ranging from nondiscrimination policy to strict numerical racial quotas. Their main purpose is twofold: to compensate for past discrimination against the target race, and to increase equality of opportunity. Education In the United States, race-conscious policies like desegregation busing have long been used to counteract school segregation. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of these measures more in the 1960s and the 1970s than it has since then. International variations France, unlike many other Western European countries (including Britain), has avoided adopting race-conscious policies. Variations in these policies between Britain and France are in large part due to the different frames through which the policies were portrayed in the two countries. Public opinion Whites are the least supportive of race-conscious policies, while African Americans are the most supportive of them. Latinos and Asian Americans take intermediate stances in their opinions of these policies. This pattern persists after controlling for measures of racial prejudice, class status, and other factors. Among white liberals, racial resentment predicts support for race-conscious programs only for black students. In contrast, among white conservatives, racial resentment is closely related to opposition to such programs regardless of the recipient's race.

In 1923, Betances moved to New York to teach with Beth Jacob Teachers‚Äô Seminary of America and stayed in the United States for the remainder of her life. In 1949, Betances earned a master's degree in religious study from Butler University in Indianapolis, where she wrote her graduate thesis, ‚ÄúOrganizing a Program of Weekday Religious Education in the Bronx Community,\\" about the lack of educational rights for Puerto Rican children living in the Bronx. She later studied at both the Sorbonne of Paris and the University of Salamanca in Spain. She married Frank Jaeger, a North American with German heritage. = Career = Betances Jaeger's writing career began in 1921 with her published essay, ‚ÄúAmor y Servicio‚Äù (\\"Love and Service\\"), for which she won an award, Ateneo Puertorrique√±o (Puerto Rican Atheneum).Vera- Rojas 2008, p. 127. In 1924, Betances Jaeger addressed her writing to the middle- and upper-class Puerto Rican women readers of the San Juan newspaper Heraldo de Puerto Rico column, ‚ÄúLectura para las damas: Deporte y literatura.‚Äù Writing for this column shaped Betances Jaeger's early career as a ‚Äúreporter and mediator of the women‚Äôs beauty and fashion.‚Äù This part of her career marked Betances Jaeger's recognition that women's physical image played an important symbolic role in the wider understanding of women's progress in society. Within a few months, Betances Jaeger gained charge of the Information Department of the Heraldo de Puerto Rico. The goal of the department was to inform readers about the educational system in Puerto Rico and in the US. The department also created a discussion forum about education in general. Over the years, Betances Jaeger was published in New York's Grafico (Illustrated) (1927‚Äì 1931), Revista de Artes y Letras (Journal of Arts and Letters) (1933‚Äì1945), and Pueblos Hispanos (Hispanic Peoples) (1943‚Äì1944), Nueva York Al Dia (New York to Date), and Ebenezer: Iglesia Discipulos de Cristo de Habla Espanola de Nueva York (Ebenezer: Disciples of Christ Church for the Spanish- Speaking in New York), as well as Puerto Rico's Puerto Rico Ilustrado (Puerto Rico Illustrated), La Democracia (Democracy), Alma Latina (Latin Soul), and El Mundo (The World). She was also published in Bolivia's Union: Revista Bolivariana (Union: Bolivarian Magazine). In addition to her contributions to other Latin American publications, Betances Jaeger's work was featured in the Spanish anarchist magazines Estudios: Revista Eclectica (Studies: Eclectic Review), Iniciales (Initials), and Al Margen (On the Margin). Betances Jaeger wrote about prominent Hispanic feminists of the era, including Uruguayan poet Juana de Ibarbourou, Puerto Rican physician Marta Robert de Romeo, Cuban writer Ofelia Rodriguez Acosta, Spanish writer Concha Espina, and Cuban feminist Mariablanca Sabas Aloma.Vera-Rojas 2008, p. 128.  Key Ideas  Betances Jaeger's work over the years focused on topics of socialism, women's issues, music, and religion. She was opposed to US imperialism and US interests in Latin American nations as well as a proponent of Panhispanism. Betances Jaeger took stands against ‚Äúthe colonization and ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô task of the US in Puerto Rico and Latin America.\\" She advocated for Hispanic women‚Äôs participation both in the economy and the opposition to war. She focused on the needs of children and the rights of Hispanic women. Betances Jaeger's writing expressed her feminist beliefs. She took stands against physical abuse, infidelity, as well as man‚Äôs concept of women as property. Ultimately, Betances Jaeger called for the reconsideration of the patriarchal standards informing Puerto Rican intellectualism during the 1930s. = Religious beliefs = Betances Jaeger‚Äôs Christianity informed her social, political, and economic justice work in the lives of New York Puerto Ricans (e.g., working for women‚Äôs rights and children‚Äôs educational rights). She sought to reemphasize Spanish heritage and the Christian faith as cultural foundations for New York‚Äôs Puerto Rican community. Betances Jaeger‚Äôs Protestant faith influenced her work as an advocate for New York‚Äôs Puerto Rican community. In the introduction to her graduate thesis, she wrote: ‚Äú[t]wo things had to be done: Keep alive in the breast of Puerto Ricans the passion of their Spanish cultural inheritance . . . and plant in them the spirit of God.‚Äù Betances Jaeger wrote in Ebenezer (April‚ÄìJune 1950) an article called ‚ÄúEduco a mi hijo‚Äù (I Educate My Son), a ‚Äúbiblical interpretation of David‚Äôs selfishness and paternal irresponsibility.\\" In this article, Betances Jaeger advocates for the role of family in children's education. She emphasizes the role of God and religion in the strength of a family. = Challenges to US imperialism = Betances Jaeger was one of many Latin American feminists who saw the importance of a Panhispanic feminism ‚Äúbased on a shared sense of identity and struggle against US imperialism.‚Äù This pan-Hispanic feminist movement took place amidst a political climate where US feminists ‚Äúpresumed superiority and assumed leadership.‚Äù Betances Jaeger provided important challenges to the racist ideologies behind US feminism of the time. Notably in 1929, US feminist Carrie Chapman Catt condemned Latin American feminists (‚ÄúSouth American women‚Äù) of ‚Äúwhat she perceived to be their lack of education and lack of helpful engagement in building peaceful relations among the Americas.\\" Betances Jaeger responded, along with various others, that women throughout Latin America (not only South America) had ‚Äúa central conception of peace.\\" Betances Jaeger further challenged that this notion of peace ‚Äúpromoted freedom of all the Americas and critiqued US imperialism.\\" = Challenges to traditional, conservative role of Hispanic women = In Grafico, Betances Jaeger wrote a four-part series about the \\"New Woman,\\" where she pushed back against Maria Mas Pozo. Pozo perceived a role of Christianity, Catholicism, and US imperialist efforts in the oppression of Puerto Rico and the world. In response to Pozo, Betances Jaeger emphasized the importance of women's responsibility in fighting to improve the Puerto Rican economy in the fight to gain political independence.Patterson 2008, p. 126. She stressed that economic issues are also women's issues. Betances Jaeger argued that meaningful political participation requires women to ‚Äúforget about trifiling matters, social conventions, and rotten prejudices.\\"  Recognition  Betances Jaeger was most recognized for her writing for Grafico and Artes y Letras. Contributions to Artes y Letras were what distinguished Betances Jaeger in New York's Hispanic intellectual circles. She made contributions to the publication ‚Äúat least until the 1950s.\\" Betances Jaeger made huge strides in her career, particularly as a feminist scholar, by writing for Grafico in the US. Grafico had a readership of Spanish-speakers in New York, particularly Puerto Ricans, as well as Cubans and Dominicans.Patterson 2008, p. 125. The publication called on its readers to resist ‚Äúethnic oppression‚Äù and claim citizenship rights as Americans. By 1929, the magazine included international and national news coverage affecting Spanish-speaking populations. Martha Patterson describes the publication as promoting a Pan-Hispanic worldview. The publication also included ‚Äúfull pages of photographs, a women‚Äôs column, fashion advice, popular culture updates, cartoons, and classified ads.‚Äù Betances Jaeger's writings to Grafico made important contributions to feminist discourse. Grafico was owned & edited by ‚Äútobacco workers, writers, and theater actors‚Äù (including Bernardo Vega and Alberto O‚ÄôFarrill). Grafico has been known for its conservative and misogynistic representations of Hispanic women's role in society. Betances Jaeger's feminist contributions to Grafico changed this narrative through repurposing the previously-traditional women's column, ‚ÄúCharlas Femininas‚Äù (\\"Feminine Chats\\"), as an ‚Äúopen space for feminist dialogues and discussions.\\" She wrote more than 50 articles for Grafico between 1929 and 1930, where she discussed ‚Äúthe new role of Hispanic women in the United States according to the discourse of American modernity and the New Woman.\\" = Accolades = Beyond her fame in the Hispanic intellectual community of New York City (NYC), Betances Jaeger has been compared to ‚Äúwomen of the feminist avante-garde‚Äù such as Federica de Montseny, Violeta Miqueli, and Angela Graupera. Betances Jaeger was a member of the Asociaci√≥n de Escritores y Periodistas Puertorrique√±os (Association of Puerto Rican Writers and Journalists) and was the Puerto Rican representative for the Union de Mujeres Americanas (American Women's Union). Betances Jaeger belonged to Circulo Cultural Cervantes (Cervantes Cultural Circle) and made presentations at various meetings there. She gave public lectures at various Hispanic civic and cultural organizations in NYC, such as ‚ÄúLa tragedia social del hombre‚Äù (\\"The social tragedy of man\\") on March 24, 1933 for the Hispano America Lodge No. 233 literary festival. She gave a lecture for the Fraternidad Estudiantil Hispanoamericana (Spanish American Student Fraternity) about Julia de Burgos‚Äô poetry on April 18, 1940. Betances Jaeger was publicly recognized for her ‚Äúdefense of Hispanic women‚Äù by Cuban feminist Mariblanca Sabas Aloma.  Written work  = Notable works = * ‚ÄúLa Mujer Nueva‚Äù (\\"The New Woman\\") published in Grafico caused debate about feminism, specifically around the topics of professionalism, women's control over their own bodies and thought, the use of contraceptives, and women's place in the job market and public as well as in private spaces. * In ‚ÄúMatrimonio y mortaja del cielo bajan‚Äù (\\"Marriage and mummification descend from the Heavens\\"), published on January 20, 1929, she advocates for the right to divorce and questions the power of men and the Church over women. * ‚ÄúHay que respetar a la mujer‚Äù (\\"Women must be respected\\"), published on September 21, 1929, is a consciousness-raising piece. * In ‚ÄúLa union constituye la fuerza‚Äù (‚ÄúIn unity there is power‚Äù), published in October 1929, she supports Panhispanism. * ‚ÄúEl Derecho Divino de Los Blancos‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Divine Right of the Whites‚Äù), published on September 30, 1939 in Puerto Rico Ilustrado, a Puerto Rican cultural publication, offers a critical eye on racism. In this article, Betances Jaeger praises the liberation work of her uncle, Ramon Emeterio Betances. She also discusses children's education as a tool to empower youth of color and challenge ‚Äúracial slavery.‚Äù = Unpublished works = * Various unpublished writings of Betances Jaeger remain, according to the research of literary critic and historian Josefina Rivera de Alvarez. Rivera de Alvarez claims these pieces include a novel, a couple of plays, and a brief biography of Betances Jaeger's uncle, Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances.

Description Pterostylis macilenta, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of between three and six, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves, each leaf long and wide. Flowering plants lack a rosette but have up to six flowers on a flowering spike high with five or six linear to narrow lance-shaped stem leaves that are long and wide. The flowers are long and the dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column. The galea is translucent dark green with darker green stripes. The lateral sepals turn downwards and are long, wide and joined for more than half their length. The labellum is long, about wide and yellowish to brown with a dark stripe along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to December. Taxonomy and naming This greenhood was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and given the name Bunochilus macilentus. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected on Mount William in the Grampians National Park.

He was the first mayor of Allegheny and a state legislator. Early life Robinson was born on 17 December 1785 in a log cabin in the area soon to become Allegheny. He was reputedly the first white child born west of the Allegheny River. His parents were James Robinson, who operated a ferry across the river, and Martha Boggs Robinson. William was styled \\"Junior\\" to distinguish him from an uncle of the same name. After schooling at Pittsburgh Academy (now the University of Pittsburgh) and Princeton University, he read law under ex-senator James Ross, but did not go on to practice the profession. In 1806, on a flatboat trip down the Ohio River, the young Robinson and several companions were detained on suspicion of taking part in the Aaron Burr conspiracy to found a Southwestern empire. They were released as nothing treasonous could be proven against them. Business Robinson managed a number of companies over his lifetime. He was the first president of the Allegheny Bridge Company, which built a bridge over the Allegheny River at what is now Sixth Street. Opened in 1819, the bridge was the first to cross the Allegheny at Pittsburgh. Robinson was the first president of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, which became part of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, a major component of the Pennsylvania Railroad system. He served for 16 years as the first president of the Exchange Bank of Pittsburgh. He was also partner in one of the area's early rolling mills. Politics Robinson was elected as a Democrat to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving from 1833 to 1834. When Allegheny borough became a city in 1840, Robinson, then a Whig, became its first mayor. His other positions in the Allegheny government included treasurer, assessor, and president of Select Council. According to one historian, Robinson had a \\"haughty and dictatorial\\" manner that hampered his political ambitions. Robinson monument at Allegheny Cemetery Mexican War Streets The Mexican War Streets neighborhood, originally called Buena Vista, was established by Robinson on part of his extensive land inheritance from his father. He laid out the plan in 1847 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, naming the streets for the war's battles and leaders. Contrary to legend, he saw no active service in the conflict. State militia In 1849, Robinson was elected major general of the 18th Division, Pennsylvania Volunteers, resulting in his being known afterward as \\"General\\" Robinson. The Volunteers at the time were a more social than military organization. Death and legacy Robinson died on 25 February 1868 and was buried at Allegheny Cemetery. He is commemorated on the North Side of Pittsburgh by General Robinson Street, which runs through his father's original farm. At the end of the 20th century, many artifacts from Robinson Jr.'s estate were unearthed at the construction site of PNC Park. His grandson, John Buchanan Robinson, was a politician who became a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania State Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.

Background Saxena had initially decided to write a sequel to his first book Finders, Keepers but was persuaded by his family to write a romance novel. He decided to write a tale between two lovers who unknowingly take a stand against each other and the love-hate relationship between them. In an interview with Half Baked Beans, Saxena mentioned that \\"UNNS is an unconventional love story\\".. In his interview with Hindustan Times, Saxena claims \\"Unns is a story of love beyond any terms and conditions.\\" Seven stages of love As per Urdu and Sufi traditions, there are seven stages of love. These seven stages are * Hub - attraction * Unns - infatuation * Ishq - love * Aqeedat - reverence * Ibadat - worship * Junoon - madness * Maut - death The concept of the seven stages of love has been discussed elaborately in Hindi movies like Dedh Ishqiya and Dil Se. Plot summary The novel is an international espionage with conflicting romance as the theme. The story spans across three countries, India, Germany and the United States. Atharva Rathod and Meher Qasim fall in love when they are in school. The romance is short lived as Meher abruptly breaks all ties with Atharva and leaves for Germany forever. Fifteen years later, Atharva travels to Germany on a secret mission where he meets Meher again. The mission ends up as a failure and Atharva is imprisoned for 12 years on charges of acting against the Research and Analysis Wing of India. As Atharva is freed after twelve years, his mentor trusts him with an amateur mission in the United States where he meets Meher once again. The story is divided across three parts, each representing a season symbolizing the maturity of love between the protagonists: spring, fall and winter. Each part is further divided into seven sub-parts, each representing one of the seven stages of love as per Urdu. The chapters are named after the three seasons along with each of the seven stages of love. The story ends on the last stage of love, which is death. Characters The main characters of the novel are: * Atharva Rathod - senior secret agent with the Research and Analysis Wing, India * Meher Qasim - very successful entrepreneur involved in the food supply chain business in Germany * Dev - secret agent with RAW * Vasu - director of the Research and Analysis Wing, India * Ayaz - an orphan who Atharva sets out to protect Reception Noted cartoonist and creator of Super Commando Dhruva, Anupam Sinha reviewed the book before its release and commented that it \\"will keep you at the edge of your seat\\".

Everyday Urbanism is in Margaret Crawford words: ‚Äùan approach to Urbanism that finds its meanings in everyday life‚Äù. Contrary to New Urbanism, Everyday Urbanism is not concerned with aesthetics but with specific activities of the daily life. It constitutes an empirical approach that strengthens frequently unnoticed existing situations and experiences that occur in everyday life. Everyday Urbanism can also be considered as a method with a multidimensional consideration of the value of public spaces as it introduces various responses to specific times and places. For instance, the value of public spaces and community life is burst with street markets, street food vendors and murals organically created; this burst created by community life results in improvements to the public space that 'Everyday Urbanism' understands as an ‚Äòimprovement by appropriation‚Äô or as a challenging appropriation of places in the city with temporary, short-lived urban activities. The study of Everyday Urbanism contributes urban planning and urban design studies with an approach to the understanding of the social use of space. It introduces the idea of eliminating the distance between experts and ordinary users and forces designers and planners to contemplate a ‚Äòshift of power‚Äô and address social life from a direct and ordinary perspective. Unlike urban design practices, Everyday Urbanism is not interested in the complete transformation of sites or urban spaces but instead in the intensification of these experiences by ‚Äúworking along with, on top of or after them‚Äù. Margaret Crawford indicates that the primary intention of the book ‚ÄòEveryday Urbanism‚Äô was a ‚Äúcall to action‚Äù, she explains that the unification of ideas and practices presented in the book seek to introduce incentives for designers to rethink the approaches they currently use to understand everyday spaces and ‚Äúto reconnect these human and social meanings with urban design and planning‚Äù. In contrast, David Walters in ‚ÄòNew Urbanism and neighborhoods‚Äô explains that Everyday Urbanism follows the roots of Postmodern planning theory in the sense that is less concerned with design as a practice and constructs a theory of explanation by hypothesizing meanings contained in the urban condition, therefore, not a theory of action as Crawford suggests. David Walters introduces an additional interpretation; he finds Everyday Urbanism when ‚Äúlocal communities and entrepreneurs reclaim leftover spaces of the capitalist city for their own use‚Äù. Examples presented in the first introduction of the concept Everyday Urbanism were mostly based in cities like Los Angeles and New York in The United States. Examples of Everyday Urbanism contain appropriations of urban space such as temporary markets, ad hoc festivals or ad hoc street fairs on deserted parking lots, garage sales, street vendors and murals. Ethnic minority group cases such as the Latino community in Los Angeles present transformation of the public environment on streets, fences, garages and yards, Camilo Jos√© Vergara documents this as part of the essays presented in the book ‚ÄòEveryday Urbanism‚Äô  Influences  The work of Margaret Crawford, John Chase and John Kaliski on Everyday Urbanism was inspired by French philosophers Henry Lefebvre, Guy Debord and Michael de Certeau. Crawford explains how they serve as an introduction to Everyday urbanism: > ‚ÄúWhile acknowledging the oppression of daily life, each discovered its > potential as a site of creative resistance and laboratory power. They > insisted on the connections between theory and social practices, between > thought and lived experience.‚Äù Lefebvre insisted that experts considered everyday life as trivial and therefore ignore it. Lefebvre was probably the most important influence in their work, given that he presented urban conditions as everyday activities that are frequently overlooked.  Concepts and Principles of Everyday Urbanism  The concept ‚ÄòEveryday Spaces‚Äô is defined by Crawford as: ‚Äúa diffuse landscape of banal, repetitive and ‚Äònon-design‚Äô locations‚Äù. Crawford presents migrants as an example of groups that appropriate spaces of the environment and create ‚Äúvernacular architecture‚Äù in neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Unlike carefully planned spaces, everyday spaces are the public use found in underused spaces. Everyday Urbanism is less concerned with spaces of the bourgeoisie such as manicured lawns, but rather interested in the poorer areas of cities, which is the opposite of designed public spaces under New Urbanism practices. A principle introduced by Crawford is ‚ÄôRefamiliarization‚Äô, she explains how Everyday Urbanism seeks to make ‚Äòbrutal‚Äô spaces more ‚Äòinhabitable‚Äô by trying to ‚Äúdomesticate urban space‚Äù. She introduces examples such as streets of Los Angeles where refamiliarization brings economic and cultural activities created by residents. As a consequence of the mismatch of aspirations between designers and the community, Crawford introduces a key principle ‚ÄòDialogic‚Äô, she defines it as: ‚Äúwhen a word, discourse, language, meaning (or building) becomes deprivileged, relativized, and aware of competing definitions for the same thing.‚Äù References Category:Urban design ","title":"Everyday Urbanism"},{"id":"54081976","text":"Antti T√∂rm√§nen (born 28 June 1989) is a professional Go player from Oulu, Finland.

Some authors employ the terms indiscriminately. Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin distinguishes: urbophobia is hostility to the city while urbanophobia is hostility to that which is urban. This trope can become politicized and thus influence spatial planning. Antiurbanism, while, of course, appearing within different cultures for different political purposes, is a global conceptSalomon Cavin (2010, p. 18). Despite massive urbanization and concentration of nearly half the world's population in urban areas,Population urbaine mondiale en 2008 et 2010 - Statistiques mondiales. the anti-urban vision remains relevant. The city is perceived as a site of frustrationAlain Sallez, Urbaphobie et d√©sir d‚Äôurbain, au p√©ril de la ville, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, . but antiurbanism manifests more as resentment towards the global city rather than towards urbanity in general.Salomon Cavin & Marchand (2010) p. 325. In the 17th and 18th centuries,Bernard Marchand, ¬´ L‚Äôurbaphobie en France depuis 200 ans : tr√®s bref r√©sum√© ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, p. 1. anti-urbanism appeared amidst the industrial revolution, the exodus of thousands of peasants, and their pauperization. Up until this time the city had been perceived as a source of wealth, employment, services, and culture; but progressively came to be considered nefarious, the source of evils such as criminality, misery, and immorality.Fran√ßois Walter, 1994, La Suisse urbaine 1750-1950, Zo√©, Carouge- Gen√®ve. England, the first country to industrialize, saw the birth of the first anti-urban newspaper, based on sentiment arising from deplorably unsanitary conditions. The city was described as black and disease-ridden, teeming with miserable exploited workers. The 1873‚Äì1896 Long Depression also accounts for the mounting critiques of the city. The rising fear of cities can thus be understood as rejection of a traumatizing reality.Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin, Les cit√©s-jardins de Ebenezer Howard : une ≈ìuvre contre la ville ?, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, p. 3. From the second half of the twentieth century critiques of the city are social and environmental, dealing with anonymity, pollution, noise pollution. In fact, positive and negative visions of the city may coexist; agrarianism may critique the bad conditions while acknowledging the role of progress and innovation. With an anti-urban ideology, negative ideas about the city are contrasted with positive values of the country such as traditions, community, and stability, which appear in the European context in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries along with the Romantic movement advocating a return to nature.La ¬´ Nature ¬ª est ici d√©finie comme ¬´ tout ce qui n‚Äôa pas besoin de l‚Äôactivit√© humaine pour exister ¬ª (Augustin Berque, 1997, Entre sauvage et artifice.

One finds acute manifestations of antiurbanism at moments of economic, political, and social crisis such as the French Revolution, the crisis of agriculture in Switzerland at the end of the 19th century, and during the rise of totalitarianism. Anti- urbanism is a significant component of the conservative American ideology.  Political and cultural influence  = Anti-urban identities = Anti- urbanism has often served for the construction of national identities.  Swiss example  Chandolin Le Village Suisse (Paris) in 1900 Switzerland has not escaped the process of urbanization. This small, mountainous country constructs her identity and representations thereof on the mountain countryside and rural villages, entirely in opposition to the city, which is considered bad for people. The village suisse, created for the 1900 Universal Exposition at Paris, an incontrovertible element in the discourse of anti- urbanism and a source of the Swiss mythology, opposed the virtuous rural Switzerland with the Switzerland corrupted by big cities.Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin, ¬´ La ville mal-aim√©e : esquisse du profil helv√©tique ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, pp. 1‚Äì4.Salomon Cavin & Marchand (2010), p. 178. The village is presented as a source of national unity and a refuge against the menace of war.  American example  Los Angeles The Democratic-Republican Party of the United States, independent in 1776 constructed their identity on rural, environmental values, with nature seen as beneficial for humanity.Cynthia Ghorra-Gobin, in Salomon Cavin & Marchand (eds.), (2010), p. 85. Their Federalist opponents, in contrast, promoted urban commerce. The Democratic Party (United States) used such agrarian sentiments to dominate the country's politics in the first half of the 19th century, though they did not prevent the coming of the industrial revolution. They saw Europe and its industrial cities negatively. Jobs in the city attract migrants, creating poor workers and forming potential hotbeds of revolution. To avoid these ills and urban overcrowding, the Americans embraced the idea of life on the outskirts, within nature, for a better way of life, yet near the city in order to reach its economic resources. Paradoxically, the rural component of American identity then gave rise to the urban sprawl around American cities which we see today.Cynthia Ghorra-Gobin, in Salomon Cavin & Marchand (eds.), (2010), pp. 83‚Äì85Catherine Maumi, 2008, Usonia ou le mythe de la ville-nature am√©ricaine, √©d. de la Villette, Paris. \\"Gated communities\\" are often discussed among the symptoms of urban pathology. They have become progressively more numerous elsewhere in the world, too. This global spread is currently interpreted as a simple diffusion of the American model of urbanism, carrying an anti-urban discourse, certainly adapted politically, contractually, and architecturally, to the needs of local tradition.Renaud Le Goix, ¬´ Les mots de l'Urbaphobie dans les m√©tropoles des √âtats-Unis : l'exemple des Gated communities ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, pp. 1‚Äì2. = Anti-urban politics = The antiurban ideologies of countries directly influence national planning, with clear consequences for society.  French example  French anti-urbanism has been strongly influenced by the work Paris and the French Desert by Jean-Fran√ßois Gravier, first published in 1947. This book, profoundly urbophobic, has since guided the politics of spatial planning in France. It recommends harsh methods to decentralize the French state, to reduce the influence of Paris its macrocephalous capital, and to redistribute work and people throughout the territory.Bernard Marchand, ¬´ L‚Äôurbaphobie en France depuis 200 ans : tr√®s bref r√©sum√© ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, p. 5‚Äì6; and Marchand in Salomon Cavin & Marchand (2010), pp. 208‚Äì209. Progressively, the French anti-urban vision has changed its goal, turning from the inner city to the suburbs, the banlieues,Bernard Marchand, ¬´ L‚Äôurbaphobie en France depuis 200 ans : tr√®s bref r√©sum√© ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, p. 7. seen as violent areas, \\"outside the Republic\\" always in opposition to the country, the rural France, the true France\\".Bernard Marchand Salomon Cavin & Bernard Marchand, eds., (2010), pp. 209‚Äì210. Paris and the French Desert seems to be favored reading material for the country's leaders.Laurent Davezies, ¬´ Croissance sans d√©veloppement en √éle-de-France ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, p. 4. In France, the politics of the city rest on a catastrophic and miserable vision of the banliues, and on an enchantment with the city center. For a long time, French society has remained pregnant with a sentiment of hostility to the city. The country and the rural civilization are perceived as holding and conserving \\"authentic\\" values‚Äînotably, with regard to tradition, family, respect for authority, connection with land, and sense of responsibility.Philippe Genestier, ¬´ L'urbanophilie actuelle, ou comment le constructionnisme politique cherche √† se r√©affirmer en s'indexant √† la ville ¬ª, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, pp. 1, 6.  Dictatorship  Hostility concerning the city and the defense of the rural formed part of official propaganda of the fascist regimes of Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Vichy France, in the years 1930‚Äì1945, but equally decades later in the Khmer Rouge regime. The politicization of anti-urbanism in its most severe form, can bring about, beyond ignorance of the city, a destruction of all things urban. In the Nazi regime, the city was seen as a traitor to the nation and a cause of the downfall of man, and of the Aryan race in particular. Following the war, the ruins were to be razed, and the country reconstructed in a manner favorable to the countryside.Marc Cluet in Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin et Bernard Marchand (eds.), 2010, Antiurbain Origines et cons√©quences de l‚Äôurbaphobie, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes, Lausanne. The Vichy regime expected that after the war France would abandon industry and become an agricultural country again. P√©tain's idea was to \\"re-root\\" the French people in French soil. For the Khmer Rouge, the city was a western construction and a menace to the traditional values of Cambodian society. The Khmer peasants, the sole keepers of true Cambodian values, were to struggle against the city and for de-urbanization. This anti-urbanist program would compel the city-dwellers to return to a culture of the earth, working alongside peasants for the greatness of the Cambodian nation.Adeline Carrier in Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin et Bernard Marchand, eds. (2010).  Anti- urbanism in culture = In literature = Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens abounds with apocalyptic descriptions of the Victorian city. Dickens describes a city where men have lost their humanity. The poor Oliver Twist must survive in a hostile urban world rife with banditry, violence, prostitution, and delinquency.Jo√´lle Salomon Cavin, Les cit√©s-jardins de Ebenezer Howard : une ≈ìuvre contre la ville ?, Communication au colloque Ville mal aim√©e, ville √† aimer, 5-12 juin 2007, Cerisy-la-Salle, .

It features a quintessential upper-class family in Mumbai. Characters =Principal characters= Indravadan Sarabhai A.k.a. Indu, who is an ex-director of a multinational company. He retired early to take care of the children and help Maya work as a social worker. He is the funniest character in the show, and constantly picks on Maya and Rosesh. He always sides with Monisha in case of a tiff between her and Maya, and constantly tries to create fun conflicts by ratting Sahil out to them, or them out to each other. He is irritated by Madhusudan bhai and his \\"hain?\\"s the most, as well as Dushyant, his son-in-law. He is the jest in the family and has attained the title of \\"Narad Muni\\", the court jest in Hindu mythology. Maya Indravadan Sarabhai She is the female head of the Sarabhai family, and runs the family like a pro. Being a snooty upper-class socialite, her daughter-in-law Monisha's middle-class money-saving techniques and unkempt behaviour is a constant pet peeve for Maya. Her catchphrase is \\"It's so middle class!\\", and she continually uses sarcasm to taunt Monisha and make her see the error of her ways. She is constantly after Indravadan to fix his dietary and cleanliness habits, not much unlike Monisha, and pampers her younger son Rosesh, also making sure he doesn't take in a middle-class wife like Sahil. Her son-in-law Dushyant also irritates her by dropping in every time an appliance is damaged. Sahil Sarabhai A cosmetic surgeon. He is the eldest child, and probably the most \\"normal\\" one. He is soft, calm, wise, and noble, and is constantly trying to resolve conflicts in his family, between Maya and Monisha, Maya and Indravadan, and Indravadan and Rosesh. He often gets 'sandwiched' between his mother and his wife, and tries not to hurt anyone. He avoids conflicts but loves making fun of his younger brother Rosesh, similar to Indravadan. Monisha Sahil Sarabhai A middle class, Punjabi girl from Noida, and now the daughter-in-law of the Sarabhais. She rarely cleans the house and is always lazing around watching daily soaps on the television. She develops a dramatic nature from these shows, and always ends up saying \\"Mai ghar chhorke ja rahi hu!\\" to Sahil after every argument with Maya. Her passion is to save money, come what may. She is always at loggerheads with Maya for her thrifty ways. Her father-in-law always supports her, while Sahil is torn between the two. Despite being careless, Monisha is a honest, and innocent loving woman. She was originally Manisha, and was named Monisha by Maya as she found the name Manisha 'too middle-class'. Rosesh Sarabhai The youngest child of Maya and Indravadan. He is a theatre artist, aspiring actor, and a poet. He is Maya's favourite and she pampers him a lot. Maya is the only member of Sarabhai family who approves of and appreciates his absurd poetry and acting skills. He has a love-hate relationship with Indravadan as he is always the target of his jokes and pranks. He always seconds his \\"Momma\\", even if he doesn't feel so. He has a peculiar and amusing voice, and his poems are always bad but funny. Arnab Sarabhai Arnab \\"Guddu Sarabhai is the smart seven-year-old son of Monisha and Sahil. He talks like his grandmother Maya and often becomes subject to a brawl between Monisha and Maya regarding his upbringing. =Recurring characters= Most episodes involve the five members of the immediate family. Members of the extended family, and friends, make regular appearances and some episode plots are centred around them as well. Sonya Paintal Sonya (played by Kshitee Jog / Shital Thakkar in season 1 ; Aishwarya Sakhuja in season 2). is the second child of Indu and Maya. She is married to Dushyant Paintal, a technician. She exhibits some of Maya's socialite attitude, and is heavily into the occult, specialising in reading the Tarot and foreseeing the future, which sometimes puts the Sarabhai family in paranoia. Dushyant Painter Dushyant Painter, played by actor/director Deven Bhojani, is Maya's son-in-law, married to her daughter Sonya. He is much despised by the rest of the family, even by the normally affable Monisha. He has a morbid fascination for various electronic appliances from toasters to tube lights to refrigerators to lifts. When the rest of the family is busy contemplating on some serious matter, he creates much chaos by quoting facts about various electronic brands and their technical details. He seems to be an in-house mechanic and electrical expert, going to great extents to explain the working of electrical goods and often using Rosesh as a guinea pig to explain the working of appliances. His catchphrase is \\"I'll explain.\\". Jasmine Mavani Jasmine, played by Vaibhavi Upadhyay, is Madhusudan's distant relative, and a singer and theatre artist. Rosesh falls in love with her when they meet. Maya disapproves of her accent and her poor English. Ila Ila ben, played by Rita Bhaduri, is Indravadan's sister and Madhusudan's wife. She often visits Indravadan & Maya, and helps them sort their daily troubles. She is a sweet, lively person who is extremely tolerant with her deaf husband and is the only one able to communicate with him through hand gestures. Madhusudan Madhu bhai, played by Arvind Vaidya, is Indravadan's brother-in-law, married to his sister Ila ben. He is hard of hearing, and refuses to use a hearing aid. He usually does not acknowledge the fact that he cannot hear, blames others for speaking too softly, and repeatedly asks questions. He is particularly bothersome to Indu and interjects almost always with a \\"hain?\\". A lot of humour is derived from his misinterpretations and the difficulty that people have in explaining things to him, which only his wife Ila, and his niece Kismi are able to do. Pankor Sarabhai (\\"Baa\\") Pankorben Sarabhai (affectionately known as \\"Baa\\"), played by Tarla Joshi, is the mother of Indravadan and Ilaben. She passed away five years before the show began. She is often mentioned by Maya and Indu, and appears in flashback scenes. She ridicules Maya for being snooty and \\"high-society\\", and always rebukes Indravadhan for his choice to marry her. Other characters include the maid Radha bai, their servant Vitthal (played by Ghanashyam Nayak), Maya's socialite friends Baldev (played by Gurpal Singh) and Sarupa Singh, her best friend Sarita and her husband Dinesh, and Maya's NRI sisters, Vidisha (played by Usha Bachani), a single socialite, and Nayesha who is married to Monisha's cousin Jugal Kishore (played by Gireesh Sahedev), as well as Madhusudan's niece, Kismi.

They speak the Soqotri language, a Semitic language in the Afroasiatic family.  General  Soqotri men The Soqotri primarily inhabit the Socotra Archipelago, on Socotra island and the Abd al Kuri, Darsah and Samhah districts of the Amanat Al Asimah governorate, Yemen. According to Ethnologue, there are an estimated 71,400 Soqotri. As of the last 1990 Socotra census, they numbered around 57,000 individuals. Most Soqotri are Sunni Muslim. Historically, Soqotri were Nestorian Christians, ever since Christianisation of the island up until the 15th century, when the island was occupied by the Mehri Sultanate in 1480. This led to slow Islamisation of the Soqotri.  Language  Soqotri children The Soqotri speak the Soqotri language (also known as Saqatri, Socotri, Sokotri and Suqutri). It belongs to the Modern South Arabian languages which are closer to the Ethiopian Semitic languages than to Arabic (Central Semitic languages). Despite historical contacts with the Arabic language, there is no mutual understanding between the native speakers of the Modern South Arabian languages and the native speaker of Arabic. Moreover, there is no mutual understanding between the speakers of the Modern South Arabian languages themselves, and the Soqotri language is only spoken on the island of Socotra. Soqotri has several dialects, which consist of ‚ÄôAbd Al-Kuri, Central Soqotri, Northern Soqotri, Southern Soqotri and Western Soqotri. North Soqotri comprises North Central and Northwest Central (highland) Soqotri. The language is written using the Naskh variant of the Arabic script. Soqotri is also transcribed with the Latin script. Genetics Most Soqotri belong to the paternal haplogroup J, bearing the basal J*(xJ1,J2) clade at its highest frequencies (71.4%). The remaining individuals mainly carry the J1 subclade (14.3%). YFull and FTDNAhttps://www.familytreedna.com/public/Y-DNA_J/default.aspx?section=yresults have however failed to find J* people anywhere in the world although there are 2 J2-Y130506 persons and 1 J1 person from Soqotra. Maternally, the Soqotri primarily belong to the haplogroups N (24.3% N*; 6.2% N1a) and R0 (17.8% R0a1b; 13.8% R0a; 6.2% R0a1). The basal N* clade occurs at its highest frequencies among them. The next most common mtDNA lineages borne by Soqotri individuals are the haplogroups J (9.2% J*; 3.1 J1b), T (7.7% T2; 1.2% T*), L3 (4.3% L3*), H (3.1%), and R (1.2 R*).

Early years Born in Banjul, Njie began his youth career at local club Wealers FC before switching to Cherno Samba's academy in 2004. In 2007, he was scouted for the national under-15 team; he traveled with them to compete in a cup competition in Norway. Two years later, he underwent a two-week trial with Norwegian club SK Brann, where his half-brother Tijan Jaiteh was playing at the time. Although he impressed team officials, he was not able to return at their request because of obligations with the national under-17 team, including the 2011 African U-17 Championship qualification tournament. He also traveled to Spain for two weeks in 2010 for a trial at his father's former club, Sevilla. Playing career =Club career= Njie joined first division Gambian side Real de Banjul in 2011 and spent the following two seasons with them, leading them to a league title in 2012. Their win earned them a spot in the 2013 CAF Champions League, where he was instrumental in their 2-1 second-leg victory over Moroccan club FUS Rabat in the preliminary round. Although they got eliminated on aggregate goals, his play attracted the attention of Rabat manager Jamal Sellami, who, four months later, signed Njie to a four-year contract after a successful trial with the club. After winning the Moroccan Cup with Rabat in 2014, Njie led them to their first-ever league title in 2015‚Äì16. That year, he was voted as Rabat's best player and drew further attention from European clubs. He also scored his second and third career CAF Confederation Cup goals that year, but Rabat eventually lost to Algerian club MO B√©ja√Øa in the semi-finals. Njie scored the game-winning goal in the second leg of a play-off round match-up against Moroccan rivals MAS Fez during 2017 CAF Confederation Cup qualification. After a 2-1 victory in the first match, Njie scored the second goal in a 1-1 draw to ensure a 3-2 aggregate win, sending them to the group stage. In the first group stage match, Rabat defeated the Ugandan domestic champions, KCCA, by a score of 3-0. Njie contributed with a goal and an assist. In July 2017, Njie joined Portuguese club Boavista F.C. on a one-year loan, with a buying option in January. He later joined Boavista permanently. In July 2018, it was reported that Njie had signed with French club Stade de Reims, although the deal was cancelled the following day due to failed medical tests. =International career= Njie made his senior national debut with Gambia on 11 June 2017 in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, coming on for Hamza Barry during a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Benin.

Dorothy Carroll in 1938. Source: The West Australian, 11 October 1938 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article46482423 Dorothy Carroll was born on 7 June 1907 in Western Australia. Her father was the manager of a stock company. The family lived at Bunbury, and participated in agricultural shows, stock sales and enjoyed riding.  Early life  After attending Bunbury High School, Carroll earned a scholarship to attend the University of Western Australia, but because she had not fulfilled the mathematics prerequisite, studied her B.A. with a major in zoology, graduating in 1929. She later took her B.Sc. with Honours in geology, one of the first women to do so in W.A. Carroll won a scholarship to attend Imperial College in 1934, University of London, and she completed her PhD in 1936. Her thesis was on the mineralogy of soils from the goldfields of Western Australia.  Career  Carroll returned to Australia, and lectured at the University of Western Australia until 1941. During World War II, she worked as a mineralogist for the Chemical laboratories of Western Australia. After accepting a position at the Linnean Society of New South Wales, she served as Secretary, in addition to lecturing at the University of Sydney. Carroll was offered a Fellowship at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania in 1951, and she used this opportunity to study chemical geological relationships within sediments and soils. She moved from Bryn Mawr to the Geochemistry and Petrology Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey in Beltsville, Maryland in 1952, which had established a sedimentary petrology laboratory, sharing a house with colleague, Marjorie Hooker. She attended the International Sedimentological Congress in 1953, and remained in London, waiting for an immigrant visa to return to the U.S. She worked on two chapters of the book, Sedimentary Petrography for Henry B. Milner, before re-entry to the U.S. It would be another two years before she became a U.S. citizen. When the petrology lab moved its facilities to Colorado in 1958, Carroll did not relocate. She remained in the Washington D.C. area studying lab methods for the disposal of radioactive waste and ion exchange. From 1963-1967, Carroll worked in the U.S.G.S. facilities near Menlo Park, California, which was studying marine sediments. When this lab closed in 1967 she remained in the area, studying clay mineralogy.  Publications  Carroll published over 70 papers. They include- *Carroll, D. (1936).

Some authors consider this as a subspecies of Elymnias hypermnestra. Description Male (upperside) Female (upperside) Mating pair This butterfly species are sexually dimorphic: males and females do not look alike. Males have black upperside forewings with small blue patches and mimic Euploea species, while the females mimic butterfly species of the genus Danaus. Both sexes have the wings longer, proportionately to their breadth, and the tail at apex of vein 4 on the hindwing longer compared to Elymnias hypermnestra. Upperside: Male differs from E. hypermnestra as follows: the subterminal and preapical spots on the forewing white suffused slightly with dark scales; the terminal half of the hindwing tawny, more or less suffused with dusky black, which in some specimens forms a distinct border along the termen. Female similar to the female of E. hypermnestra, but the black more extended; veins 2, 3, and 4 on the hindwing broadly bordered with black. Underside: Female differs from E. hypermnestra in the more conspicuous broadly triangular white pre-apical patch on the forewing, and in the prominence of the broad tawny terminal half of the upperside of the hindwing, which shows through a pale, sometimes pinkish brown on the underside. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brown, paler beneath and much paler in the female than in the male. Range It is endemic to South India.

Unlike other countries within the European Union, UK provisions to detain are not outlined in a codified consistitution. Instead, immigration enforcement holds individuals under Powers granted in the Immigration Act 1971 and by the Home Office Detention Centre Rules (2001). The expressed purpose of immigration detention is to \\"effect removal; initially to establish a person‚Äôs identity or basis of claim; or [implement] where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to a grant of immigration bail.\\" Detention can only lawfully be exercised under these provisions where there is a \\"realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable period\\". In 2019, a majority of immigration detainees were individuals who were seeking, or had claimed, asylum (58%). Other individuals liable for detention include those held whilst awaiting determination of their right to enter the UK, people who have been refused permission to enter and are awaiting removal, people who have overstayed the expiry of their visas or have not complied with their visa terms, and people lacking the required documentation to live in the UK. The British Home Office currently operates one Pre-Departure Accommodation, three residential Short Term Holding Facilities (STHFs), seven Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs) and 13 In-Use Short-Term Holding Facilities which can be used to detain individuals under Immigration Act Powers. HM Prisons are also used as settings of detention under Immigration Powers, usually if the detainee was serving a prison sentence which expired. The management of a majority of IRCs is outsourced to private companies including Mitie, GEO Group, G4S and Serco. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 formally changed the name of \\"detention centres\\" to \\"removal centres\\". Removal centres The UK removal centres are: * Brook House Immigration Removal Centre near Gatwick Airport, which is run by G4S Group * Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow Airport which is run by Mitie * Dungavel in Lanarkshire run by GEO Group * Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre also near Heathrow Airport which is run by Mitie * Larne House Immigration Reception Centre, Larne, Antrim which is run by Tascor, a subsidiary of Capita * Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre, near Newark on Trent which is run by the Her Majesty's Prison Service * Pennine House Immigration Reception Centre, at Manchester Airport which is run by Tascor, a subsidiary of Capita * Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre near Gatwick Airport which is run by G4S * Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire run by Serco Policies The British government has been given powers to detain asylum seekers and migrants at any stage of the asylum process. The use of asylum has increased with the introduction of the process of 'fast track', or the procedure by which the Immigration Service assess asylum claims which are capable of being decided quickly. Fast-tracking takes place in Oakington Reception Centre, Harmondsworth and Yarl's Wood. There are three situations in which it is lawful to detain an asylum seeker or migrant. # To fast track their claim # If the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the asylum seeker or migrant will abscond or not abide by the conditions of entry. # If the asylum seeker or migrant is about to be deported. Figures published for January ‚Äì March 2008 by the Home Office revealed the following: * 2305 people were detained in 'removal centres' in the UK under Immigration Act powers (this figure excludes those held in prisons) * 1980 immigration detainees were male * 35 children under 18 were detained * 1640 detainees had claimed asylum at some stage Once detained it is possible to apply for bail. It is preferable but not necessary to provide a surety and conditions will be provided, usually reporting, if bail is granted. There is legal aid for representation at bail hearings and the organisation Bail for Immigration Detainees provides help and assistance for those subject to detention to represent themselves. Since summer 2005 there has been an increase in the detention of foreign nationals since the Charles Clarke scandal which revealed that there were a number of foreign nationals who had committed crimes and had not been deported at the end of their sentence. Criticism of immigration detention focuses on comparisons with prison conditionspolitics.co.uk in which persons are kept though they have never been convicted of a crime, the lack of judicial oversight, and on the lengthy bureaucratic delays that often prevent a person from being released, particularly when there is no evidence that the detainee will present a harm or a burden to society if allowed to remain at large while their situation is examined. Recently, the conditions of detention centres have been criticised, by the United Kingdom Inspector of Prisons.  The Tinsley Model  In 1996 Immigration Detention Centre Tinsley House was commissioned. It was the first purpose-built immigration detention facility in the United Kingdom and was initially managed by the British subsidiary of the American Wackenhut Corporation. The original senior management of Tinsley House, specifically the centre director and its operations manager, pioneered an adapted version of Wackenhut's philosophy of ‚ÄòDynamic Security‚Äô which promoted a regime of caring custody emphasising positive relations between staff and detainees and encouraging the respectful and sensitive handling of all detainee related issues. This concerned approach towards detainee management was quickly embraced by the centre's chaplain who reinforced the existing commitment to caring custody through the creation of specialised training programmes for the centre's staff and by increasing the size and diversity of the centre's chaplaincy team. With the active support of the centre's senior management, the Tinsley House chaplaincy set about the task of addressing in detail the dietary, cultural, religious and social needs of the centre's population inviting a variety of religious ministers and representatives of cultural groups to attend the centre to provide pastoral support. Tinsley House became the first detention centre in the United Kingdom to operate a comprehensive regime of religious and cultural observance and to operate a diversity of permanent religious facilities. The attention to religious and cultural needs combined with an overt commitment on the part of the detention centre staff towards treating those in their custody with care and sensitivity began to impact the environment and operations at Tinsley House. Detainees would write messages of appreciation to members of staff noting their efforts of assistance and staff would regularly form respectful friendships with those in their charge. The product of this regime, which became known as the ‚ÄòTinsley Model‚Äô was to result in an environment which, during its first decade of operations, incurred no incidence of death, riot or disturbance; a performance which remains unmatched in the history of the UK Immigration Service. The ‚ÄòTinsley Model‚Äô attracted the attention of the Prince of Wales as well as numerous religious and political leaders and was cited as being a graphic example of the effectiveness of ‚Äòcaring custody‚Äô. In December 2001 the senior chaplain of Tinsley House authored a report to the Home Secretary detailing the essence of the Tinsley Model, recording its positive effects and outlining how this regime might be exported throughout the Immigration estate. The report was signed by sixteen bishops, four leading Muslim clerics, representatives of the Sikh and Hindu communities, four members of the House of Lords and the Member of Parliament for Crawley. The Home Office response to this proposal was to pass it to the Immigration Minister who forwarded it to the head of the Immigration Service who in turn requested that it be actioned by the director responsible for Detention Operations. The Detention Operations department of the Immigration Service did not accept the findings of the report and expressed their displeasure at the centre's operating company (now Group 4) ‚Äòinterfering‚Äô in government policy issues and which resulted in the suspension of the centre's senior chaplain. A month after this report was published; the newest facility in the Immigration estate, the ¬£40 million Yarl's Wood detention centre near Bedford was largely destroyed by fire as a result of altercations between staff and detainees. With a lack of support from the Immigration Service, the introduction of Group 4's management style (with its largely prison based philosophies) and the departure of the centre's original management team, the ‚ÄòTinsley Model‚Äô became increasingly difficult to maintain resulting in a decline in the centre's previously caring regime. In 2009 an unannounced inspection of Tinsley House by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons reported that \\"conditions had generally deteriorated and the arrangements for children and single women were now wholly unacceptable\\" and that \\"staff talked openly about an increased prison culture encroaching on Tinsley House‚Äôs previously relaxed atmosphere\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20150215213530/http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/inspectorate- reports/hmipris/immigration-removal-centre-inspections/tinsley- house/Tinsley_House_2009_rps.pdf The gradual erosion of the centre's initial regime of 'Caring Custody' effectively marked the end of the 'Tinsley Model' and with it the dynamic of the chaplaincy's intensive pastoral care which had been a fundamental feature of the model. Deaths in immigration custody The Government does not routinely publish the number of detainees who die in custody, but data mapping by INQUEST suggests that a further three individuals died whilst being held under Immgiration Act Powers during 2016, nine in 2017, three in 2018 and one in 2019 . In 2018, the Government announced that it would begin publishing data on deaths in IRCs for the first time. However, the definitive annual number of deaths in detention remain unknown, as quarterly Home Office statistics do not differentiate between deaths and detainees leaving detention for 'other' reasons. In total, there have been at least 40 deaths in immigration custody since 1989, including: * Siho Iyiguveni 8 October 1989 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Kimpua Nsimba 15 June 1990 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Robertus Grabys - Suicide by hanging, aged 49 24 January 2000 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Michael Bodnarchuk - Suicide by hanging, aged 42 31 January 2003 - Haslar Detention Centre * Olga Blaskevica - Murdered by husband, aged 29 7 May 2003 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Kabeya Dimuka-Bijoux - Collapsed while running, aged 34 1 May 2004 - Haslar Detention Centre * Sergey Barnuyck ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 31 19 July 2004 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Tran Quang Tung - Suicide by hanging, aged 24 23 July 2004 - Dungavel Detention Centre * Kenny Peter ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 24 7 November 2004 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Unknown male - AIDS, aged 33 14 March 2005 - Oakington Detention Centre * Ramazan Kumluca ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 18 27 June 2005 - Campsfield Detention Centre * Manuel Bravo ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 35 15 September 2005 - Yarl's Wood Detention Centre * Bereket Yohannes ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 26 19 January 2006 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Oleksiy Baronovsky - Self harm (cutting), aged 34 10 June 2006 - HMP Rye Hill * Unknown male - Tuberculosis, aged 32 1 September 2008 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Richard Abeson - Liver cancer, aged 69 23 October 2009 - HMP Wandsworth * Eliud Nguli Nyenze ‚Äì Heart attack, aged 40 15 April 2010 - Oakington Detention Centre * Reza Ramazani - Coronory condition, aged 56 23 March 2010 - HMP Nottingham * Jimmy Mubenga - Unlawful killing, aged 46 12 October 2010 - Aircraft, discharged from Brook House Detention Centre * Riluwanu Balogan - Suicide by hanging, aged 21 16 May 2011 - HM Glen Parva * Muhammed Shuket, Heart attack, aged 47 2 July 2011 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Brian Dalrymple ‚Äì Schizophrenia, hypertension, aged 35 31 July 2011 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Ianos Dragutan ‚Äì Suicide by hanging, aged 31 2 August 2011 - Campsfield Detention Centre * Gonzales Jorite - Tuberculosis, aged 40 6 December 2011 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Kwabena Fosu - Sudden adult death syndrome, aged 31 30 October 2012 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Unknown male - Rheumatic valve disease, aged 43 17 November 2012 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Alois Dvorzac ‚Äì Heart attack in dementia, aged 84 10 February 2013 - Harmondsworth Detention Centre * Khalid Shahzad ‚Äì Suspected heart attack, aged 52 30 March 2013 - Pennine House Immigration Reception Centre * Tahir Mehmood ‚Äì Heart attack, aged 43 26 July 2013 - Pennine House Immigration Reception Centre * Rene Frings - Heart disease, aged 44 23 November 2011 - HMP Wormwood Scrubs * Mohamoud Ali - Sudden death in epilepsy, aged 36 1 February 2014 - HMP Parc * Christine Case - Pulmonary embolism, aged 40 30 March 2014 - Yarls Wood * Bruno dos Santos - Neurosarcoidosis, aged 26 4 June 2014 - HMP The Verne * Rubel Ahmed - Suicide by hanging, aged 26 5 September 2014 - IRC Morton Hall Lincoln * Pinakinbhai Patel - Heart attack, aged 33 20 April 2015 - Yarls Wood * Thomas Kirung - Suicide by hanging, aged 30 6 August 2015 - HMP The Verne * Amir Siman-Tov - Suicide by overdose, aged 41 17 Feb 2016 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Unknown 1 December 2016 - Colnbrook Detention Centre * Unknown male - Murdered, aged 49 30 November 2016 - IRC Morton Hall Lincoln * Tarek Chowdhury - Murdered, aged 34 30 December 2016 - IRC Morton Hall Lincoln * Carlington Spencer - Stroke, aged 27 3 October 2017 - IRC Morton Hall Lincoln References Category:Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom Category:Deportation from the United Kingdom ","title":"Immigration detention in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"54082420","text":"Sizani is a South African name that may refer to *Sizani Ngubane, South African rural women's rights activist *Stone Sizani (born 1954), South African politician ","title":"Sizani"},{"id":"54082460","title":"1998 NCAA Division II football rankings"},{"id":"54082463","text":"Oscar Johnson (c. 1863 - July 28, 1916) was an American businessman.

The monastery was officially established on 1 April 1953 as a daughter house of Koningshoeven Abbey in Tilburg, Netherlands. Apart from being a residence for the monks, there are also a church, prayer garden, retreat houses, coffee plantations, dairy farms along with the processing industries within the monastery complex. Ronald Bell, a pilgrim from the United States, shares his impression about this place, \\"You will get all the stages, praying, meditating, contemplating sacred readings, and working. All of those constitute an inseparable part of the experience.\\" Not far from the monastery complex, it lies the Church of Santa Maria dan Yoseph as the center of the Rawaseneng Parish, just ahead of the Kindergarten and Elementary School of Fatima Rawaseneng which are managed by the Dominican nuns. Like the monks in other Trappist monasteries, the monks of Rawaseneng Monastery lives on prayer and works of their hands. The results of their works on coffee plantations, dairy farms, and bakery/cake industries become the main source of livelihood of the monks in the monastery, thus they do not live by relying on contribution from the congregation.

West End became a brand of the South Australian Brewing Company, and continues to this day. History West End Brewery 1880 West End Brewery 1920 Some time around 1844 William Henry Clark (approx. 1815‚Äì1870), an Irish immigrant to South Australia, founded the Halifax Street Brewery; to the nearby inhabitants a most unwelcome addition to the neighbourhood due to the stench of the liquid he discharged into Gilles Street. :In July 1854 Clark, with partners J. B. Spence, J. H. Parr and Edward Logue, took over Crawford brothers' Hindmarsh Brewery in order to close it down and supply its customers from the Halifax Street brewery. The business continued however under E. J. F. Crawford. :William Knox Simms and John Hayter operated the Pirie Street brewery from 1851 to 1855 when Hayter left the partnership. This brewery was also not popular with those living nearby. Simms took over the Halifax Street operation in March 1856, then in February 1858 Clark sold the property to Henry Noltenius. In July 1858 Noltenius took in Simms as a partner, then in November 1858 sold him his interest in the business. Clark meanwhile had borrowed money from John Haimes to build a new brewery on Town Acre 66 at the south side of Hindley Street, midway between Morphett Street and West Terrace. :Noltenius found himself in financial difficulties, and neither Simms nor Clark could repay any of the ¬£3,530 they collectively owed him, which resulted in his insolvency. Clark moved to Victoria in 1860, and thereby evaded his creditors, and probably died there some time before 1873. In 1859 a consortium of Simms, Haimes, and Edgar Chapman founded the \\"West End Brewery\\" on the Hindley Street property, and invested heavily in establishing buildings, in cellar construction, and equipping the brewery with all the latest refinements. The location had the advantage of proximity to the Parklands (less smell nuisance), the Port Road (transport of raw materials and finished product) and the River Torrens (handy for discharge of effluent). By October 1859 W. H. Clark (!) was advertising barrels of \\"West End Ale\\" for sale to publicans at ¬£2/2s. They closed their smaller, competing establishments, which included Halifax Street. Simms ran the business with help from Clark's brewer John Plummer Gardner. Gardner was murdered by a fellow miner at the Inglewood, Victoria diggings c. 1 April 1860. W. K. Simms bought the company in 1861; Edgar Chapman was his partner 1865‚Äì1879. An extensive contemporary description of the brewery may be read here. The West End Brewery proved highly profitable and Simms and Chapman became wealthy men. They joined with Edwin Smith, who in 1876 built a large brewery complete with its own malting facilities at Kent Town, William Rounsevell and Alfred Simms, as the South Australian Brewing, Malting & Wine & Spirit Co. Ltd., enlarging the brewing facilities at West End, and centering the malting work at Kent Town. In 1893 they sold off their wine and spirit business to A. E. & F. Tolley Pty Ltd and Milne & Co., and the name was changed to South Australian Brewing Company, Limited. :The company began a campaign of purchasing hotels freehold or leasehold, and by the end of the 1880s had a stranglehold on the Adelaide market, owning 44 hotels and leasing 65. Until 1974, when the Whitlam government revised the Trade Practices Act they were legally able to dispense only the company's beer in their pubs. :Robert Stock, Edwin Smith‚Äôs brother-in-law and manager of the Kent Town Brewery became chairman of the board and general manager of SA Brewing; Stock died in 1904 and Samuel Jacobs served from 1904 to 1937. Jacobs' son (later Sir) Roland Jacobs was managing director from 1948 to 1967. From 1955 operations were split between the company's two major factories, with the West End brewery making only draught beer in kegs; bottled beer only was produced at the Thebarton (\\"Nathan\\", later \\"Southwark\\") plant. In 1980, faced with mounting problems with traffic on West Terrace and ageing and inefficient equipment, not to mention the rapidly increasing value of City land, the brewery closed and the property sold.

The law covers all private and public vehicles, including agricultural machines, construction equipments, public utility buses and jeepneys, taxicabs, motorcycles, tricycles, pedicabs, kuligligs and carriages. Enactment On February 3, 2016, Senators Bong Revilla, Jinggoy Estrada and Sergio Osme√±a III filed Senate Bill No. 3211 at the Philippine Senate Committee on Public Services which aims to \\"safeguard its citizenry from the ruinous and extremely injurious effects of vehicular accidents\\" caused by the \\"unrestrained use of electronic mobile devices.\\" Similar legislation was also introduced in the Philippine House of Representatives as House Bill No. 4531 on June 6, 2016 by Tarlac Rep.

The road safety measure was submitted by the 16th Congress of the Philippines to President Benigno Aquino III on July 27, 2015 and lapsed into law without the President's signature or veto on July 21, 2016. Under Article 6 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, \\"the President shall communicate his veto of any bill to the House where it originated within 30 days after the date of receipt thereof; otherwise, it shall become a law as if he had signed it.\\" It also states that a law will take effect 15 days after its publication in at least two newspapers of general circulation. Enforcement The Anti-Distracted Driving Act took effect on May 18, 2017 under the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Under the law, drivers are only allowed to use hands-free functions of gadgets, such as speaker phones, provided that these do not block their line of sight. The implementing agency is the Land Transportation Office (LTO) under the Department of Transportation that was tasked to promulgate the necessary implementing rules and regulations within 60 days from the effectivity of the Act. It also ordered the LTO, the Philippine Information Agency, the Department of Education, the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to undertake a nationwide information, education and communication campaign for a period of 6 months from the effectivity of the Act. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, the PNP and other law enforcement agencies are required to enforce the act. =Fines= A motorist caught in violation of the Act shall be fined for the first offense, for the second offense, and for the third offense plus suspension of his or her driving license for 3 months. On the fourth offense, the erring driver shall be fined plus a revocation of the driving license. Erring drivers of public utility vehicles, school buses, school service vehicles, and common carriers hauling volatile, flammable or toxic material shall be fined and suspension of their driving license for 3 months. The same penalty applies to motorists caught in violation of the Act within a radius of school premises. The LTO, as implementing agency, may increase the amount of fines once every five years, in the amount not exceeding 10 percent of the existing rates, which shall take effect only upon publication in at least two newspapers of general circulation. Exemptions The Act does not apply to: * Motorists using mobile phones for emergency purposes, including emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, health care provider, fire department or other emergency services; * Motorists operating emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, in the course and scope of their duties. Reaction * Grab and Uber welcomed the implementation of the Anti-Distracted Driving Act and said it would contribute to road safety, benefitting both drivers and commuters. They reminded all their partner-drivers to strictly comply with the new law as they have distributed materials for their drivers to make sure they know what they can and cannot do while transporting their passengers. Suspension On May 23, 2017, enforcement of the Act was suspended after it caused confusion among motorists due to lack of proper information dissemination. The House Committee on Transportation asked for a review of the implementing rules and regulations after it was learned that the Land Transportation Office only conducted an awareness campaign for enforcers and not the public at large. The committee pointed out the provision in the law that stipulates that its full implementation should only come after a six-month aggressive information campaign. LTO chief Edgar Galvante admitted the lapse in implementation and said that the LTO does not have the authority to carry out the information drive unless approved first by both chambers of Congress. The House Committee then passed a motion to hold in abeyance the law's implementation.

History The Szabari family originated from the notable gens Hah√≥t. According to the fourteenth-century chronicle composition, the founder of the kindred, knight Hahold descended from the Counts of Orlam√ºnde, arriving to Hungary in 1163 upon the invitation of Stephen III to help to defeat the rebelled Cs√°k kindred. Hahold's grandson Blessed Buz√°d, who retired from politics and joined the Dominican Order, donated his estates of Buz√°dsziget and Szabar (today Zalaszabar) to his eldest son Buz√°d III on 14 February 1233. After the invasions of Ottokar II of Bohemia and the powerful K≈ëszegi family, who established dominion independently of the royal power since the early 1270s, Buz√°d III's son Atyusz resided permanently in Szabar. For his participation in the military campaign against Ottokar, he received the lands of Kerecseny and Palkonya from Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Atyusz Hah√≥t had a son from his first unidentified wife, John II Hah√≥t who later adopted the surname Szabari (\\"of Szabar\\") in his documents (John I Szabari in genealogical sense), thus became the first member of the Szabari family. In 1292, among others, he was sent to the K≈ëszegis as a hostage in order to liberate Andrew III of Hungary. His father Atyusz died between 1302 and 1310. Despite being a sole heir, John had financial problems already in 1310, when he had to sell his estates of Sz√∂lc, P√°cod and Budafa (today Zalal√∂v≈ë) to the Salamonv√°ri family to pay the dowry of his stepmother, Atyusz's second wife. He also donated Buz√°dsziget to John L≈ërinte in 1313 to settle his debt. On 27 June 1323, he also had to sell below fair value his land of Iv√°nc, near Fels≈ëlendva (today Grad, Slovenia) to Nicholas Fels≈ëlendvai, Ban of Slavonia, who commiserated John and handed over his small land of Bar√°ti in Somogy County to him. In 1332, John owned Gelsesziget and Bagota in Zala County. He was last mentioned by sources in 1348. He died by 15 May 1353, as his wife Margaret Nagymartoni appeared then as his widow. His sons L≈ëk√∂s, John II and Atyusz were first mentioned in 1348. The latter two of them attacked and tried to kill one of the officials of the Zalav√°r Abbey, according to a charter issued on 2 June 1351. They also appeared as members of the \\"Buz√°d kindred\\" in August 1360, when descendants of the Buz√°d branch (the Szabaris, Cs√°nyis and S√∂jt√∂ris through the lineage of Buz√°d III, Cs√°k I and Lancelot, respectively) unsuccessfully attempted to regain their former possessions from the Lackfi family on the occasion of a lawsuit lasted from 1351 until 1376. In December 1365, John II and Atyusz protested against that after a praefectio in filium by his father Nicholas V, Klara, a descendant of Buz√°d IV (son of Cs√°k I) granted the village of Buz√°dsziget. The document also mentioned John's minor son without name. In 1368 and 1376, only Atyusz and John's son Peter were alive. They died without male heirs by 1384, as Mary, Queen of Hungary donated the family's orphaned lands to the distant relative B√°nfi de Als√≥lendva family after the Szabaris' extinction.

Once the largest Methodist church in the Midwest, it ceased as a place of worship in 1975 after a relatively brief life of just over 50 years. History A Methodist church had been present in Gary since 1906 (also the year of the city's founding). In 1916, Dr William Grant Seaman became its pastor. A man of dynamic energy, Seaman envisaged a much larger church to serve the town, wanting to bring a prominent religious presence into what was then a somewhat insalubrious neighbourhood with numerous brothels and drinking establishments. Seaman secured the backing of US Steel, the chief employer in the city. The company donated the site on which the church was to be built, and agreed to donate almost half of the cost. The construction, beginning in 1925 took 21 months and cost $800,000, a truly vast sum. The first service was held in the church on 3 October 1926. The organ was donated by Elbert Gary, after whom the city was named. The church was built by Lowe and Bollenbacher of Chicago. The sanctuary at the forefront of the structure is part of a much larger nine-story complex which included an adjoining theatre called Seaman Hall, which could seat 1000 people, and contained corporate offices, a gymnasium, a Sunday School and a dining hall. There were plans for a bowling alley, but this was never built. A rooftop garden on the roof of the hall was never finished. By 1927, the church had a congregation of 1,700 and a staff of six. By 1929, William Seaman had grown unpopular with his parishioners, due at least in part to his interests in cultural diversity (including interfaith pageants). His dissatisfied congregation had him involuntarily transferred to Ohio. In some irony, his successor proved even less popular with the churchgoers. Seaman died in 1944. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were returned to Gary, where they were interred in the church. During the Great Depression, the church leased part of Seaman Hall to Gary College to gain much-needed additional funds. In the postwar years, the Indiana University Centre used part of Seaman Hall, and by 1949, Indiana University Northwest occupied three of the floors. The church reached the pinnacle of its popularity in the 1950s, with membership surpassing 3000. Decline and closure After Gary declined in the 1960s and 70s, the church's fortunes began to likewise crumble. Predominantly a white middle-class institution, the church lost large numbers of parishioners to white flight as Gary's social makeup altered and better-off inhabitants moved away. Crime rates in the area soared, causing more departures, and maintenance costs were ruinous, owing to the church's huge dimensions and the harsh lakefront climate. By 1973, there were only 320 members in the then-aging congregation, about a third of whom regularly attended. After attempts to sell the building to another congregation proved fruitless, the decision was eventually taken to close the church in 1975. After closure Interior in 2009. The section of roof nearest the window has since collapsed The structure passed into the hands of Indiana University, which continued to use part of Seaman Hall as a satellite campus, but nothing was done with the church itself. By the 1990s, the church was already starting to decay, but was then severely damaged by a fire in 1997, which accelerated the deterioration even further. The church is a popular destination for urban exploration (though permits are now required) and has even been the location of Goth weddings in recent years. Future The complex is still standing, but much is beyond any realistic restoration, and has been placed on Indiana Landmarks' 10 Most Endangered Places in Indiana list. Most of the interior fixtures have been removed by thieves. In 2011, part of the roof of the sanctuary collapsed. In 2014, the city authorities revived an aborted plan from the early 2000s to turn the site into a large park in which the sanctuary would be the centrepiece, and to demolish the rest of the complex. As a location The church has been used many times as a film location, including for A Nightmare on Elm Street, Transformers: Dark of the Moon and parts of Pearl Harbor and Sense8. The series Life After People included the church in its exploration of Gary from Season 1, Episode 2.

Career =Playing career= Papadopoulos began his football career at the infrastructure segments of his local Proodeftiki and was promoted to the first team in 1987. He spent the majority of his career in Proodeftiki, with brief tenures at Atromitos and Doxa Vyronas towards the end of his playing career. Papadopoulos retired in 1999, last playing for Proodeftiki in the Greek Alpha Ethniki. =Managerial career= Several months after his retirement, Papadopoulos began his coaching career as an assistant manager at Proodeftiki in the Greek Alpha Ethniki. He took on as interim manager during coaching staff replacements and eventually, was appointed head coach of the club in 2000. Despite the club's relegation at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 Alpha Ethniki season, Papadopoulos was entrusted to lead the team back to top-flight, which he managed after managing the club for two seasons in the Beta Ethniki. He would remain manager of Proodeftiki for the following two seasons in the Alpha Ethniki until the end of the 2003‚Äì04 Alpha Ethniki season, when he resigned from his post after a loss from Panionios, thus failing to avoid relegation to the Beta Ethniki. Papadopoulos moved to Cyprus and was appointed head coach of Cypriot First Division side Apollon Limassol. His stay however was brief, as he resigned from his post in September 2004 after a 6‚Äì1 loss from Alki Larnaca. He returned to Greece to take over Kastoria in the Beta Ethniki, but terminated his contract in just two days, due to personal reasons. Early in 2005, Papadopoulos took over as manager of Paniliakos, also in the Beta Ethniki before returning to Proodeftiki in the summer of 2005, managing the club for two seasons in the Beta Ethniki. At the end of the 2006-07 Beta Ethniki season, Proodeftiki finished in 16th place, thus being relegated to the Gamma Ethniki (the third tier of the Greek football league system) and Papadopoulos' contract with the club was terminated. Papadopoulos moved to Vyzas in 2007, and then Olympiacos Volos until March 2008. A month later, he was hired by Pierikos where he managed to avoid relegation at the end of the season. He thus renewed his stay at Pierikos, until April 2009. In September 2009, Papadopoulos took over management of Egaleo, resigning after managing no win in three consecutive matches. He returned to Pierikos in October 2009, where he managed to enter the promotion play-offs. After Pierikos failed to promote to the Superleague in the process, Papadopoulos' contract was terminated. At the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season, he moved to Rhodes to take over local club Diagoras. He resigned after three games, and was appointed head coach by fellow Football League side Veria until January 2011. In March, he once again returned to Pierikos. He left the club in January 2012, and was appointed head coach of Iraklis in the Football League 2 Northern Group. In May 2012 he was hired a fourth time by Pierikos until the end of the season. In the summer of 2012, he moved to Doxa Drama. At the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season, in October 2012 and after consecutive bad results during the championship, Papadopoulos resigned as coach of Doxa Drama and was subsequently hired again by Olympiacos Volos, where he stayed until January 2013. Papadopoulos then returned to the Superleague to take over management of former league powerhouse Aris in March 2013. Given the club's financial situation and struggling nature, Papadopoulos successfully managed to stay clear of relegation at the end the season, but terminated his contract in June, only to be re-appointed in December that same year to replace Zoran Milinkoviƒá. His second tenure with Aris was less successful however, and after a loss against Ergotelis in March 2014, which solidified Aris' relegation to the Football League, Papadopoulos resigned. In July 2014, he took over management of Cretan club Chania in the Football League but was replaced in October that same year. He was re-appointed in January 2015 and stayed in Chania for one more month. In March, he moved to AE Larissa until the end of the season. In August 2015, Papadopoulos was hired by Lamia, departing after a loss against his former club AE Larissa during the opening match of the 2015‚Äì16 Football League season. In October 2015 Papadopoulos returned for a third time in his career to Olympiacos Volos, departing in December. After a one-year break, Papadopoulos was hired by former Superleague club Ergotelis in the Gamma Ethniki in January 2017. Although considered a title contender, Ergotelis trailed 7 points behind Ionikos when Papadopoulos took over. Nevertheless, Papadopoulos achieved a remarkable unbeaten record (12 wins, 3 draws) to narrowly finish on top of the 2016‚Äì17 Gamma Ethniki Group 4 Table, achieving promotion to the Football League. His stay was not renewed for the next season however, due to the departure of former club president Georgios Vrentzos, and an eventual change in club leadership. In December 2017, Papadopoulos was hired by Gamma Ethniki side Asteras Amaliada, with whom he won his second Gamma Ethniki title in a row, leading the club to the top of the Group 5 Table and the Football League promotion play-offs. However, he was fired after a 3‚Äì0 away loss to Irodotos in the opening match of the play-offs.\\"Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÇ Œø Œ£ŒøœçŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥œåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒøŒΩ ŒëœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± ŒëŒºŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ (Greek)\\", sportime.gr Honours =As a manager= ;Ergotelis * Gamma Ethniki: 2016‚Äì17 ;Asteras Amaliada * Gamma Ethniki: 2017‚Äì18 References Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Greek footballers Category:Proodeftiki F.C. players Category:Atromitos F.C. players Category:Greek football managers Category:Proodeftiki F.C. managers Category:Apollon Limassol FC managers Category:Paniliakos F.C. managers Category:Vyzas F.C. managers Category:Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C. managers Category:Pierikos F.C. managers Category:Egaleo F.C. managers Category:Diagoras F.C. managers Category:Veria F.C. managers Category:Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. managers Category:Doxa Drama F.C. managers Category:Aris Thessaloniki F.C. managers Category:AO Chania F.C. managers Category:AE Larissa FC managers Category:Ergotelis F.C. managers Category:Aittitos Spata F.C. managers Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Nikaia, Attica Category:Greek expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Expatriate football managers in Cyprus Category:Doxa Vyronas F.C. players ","title":"Soulis Papadopoulos"},{"id":"54083055","text":"Saleh (Charlie) Sadadeen, sometimes spelt Sadadene, (c.1870 ‚Äì 19 July 1933) was an Afghan cameleer and bushman who lived in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. Cameleer Sadadeen was born in Baloochistan around 1870. By 1880 he was working as a camel man for Lord Roberts on the march to Kandahar. It is thought he immigrated to Australia after obtaining work near Oodnadatta in South Australia at the time the railway line was completed in 1890. He was working with camel teams by 1902 for the Wallis Brothers, carting goods from Oodnadatta to Stuart, now Alice Springs and to Arltunga. By 1914 he managed a strong of 120‚Äì130 camels, half belonging to him, the other half to Wallis and Co. Legendary bushman Walter Smith worked for Sadadeen for about 15 years. He described him as a hard man but deeply respected his skills and practices. Smith suffered from migraines and describes Sadadeen leaving him under a tree with a billy of water, expecting him to catch up to the camel train upon recovery. Sadadeen married Annie Markham, but the relationship ended. They had no children. A devout Muslim, he was a leader for the Afghan community in their worship at a small mosque on Todd Street in Alice Springs. Sadadeen lived on Todd Street in central Alice Springs where he grew flowers, including at times, opium. He also grew vegetables at a place called Sadadeen Swamp about 30 kilometres south of Alice Springs. The land on which the Alice Springs Town Council is currently sited was once Charlie Sadadeen's market garden. Two date palms planted in this garden can still be seen. Legacy Sadadeen died in Alice Springs in 1933. There is a monument and park dedicated to Sadadeen and his fellow cameleers outside the Alice Springs Town Council, on the block where Sadadeen lived. The Alice Springs suburb of Sadadeen is named after him, as is Sadadeen Primary School. Sadadeen Range on the east of Alice Springs also takes his name, which was where he kept his camels.

These are equipped with specific tools for the integration and the testing of models for development, qualification or flight. There are also climatic rooms and a thermal vacuum chamber in order to recreate the extreme conditions of temperature and to validate the projects. Argotec has also a Clean Room (ISO 5, Class 100) for the integration and the test of flight parts, included optics sensible to contaminated environments. Argotec has its own Mission Control Centre directly connected with NASA control centres where Argotec engineers can control and support the operations done onboard the International Space Station in real-time.  Research and development  The research and development activity in the heat pipe field allowed the company to develop an internal numerical model that, coupled with an optimization model, permits the design of heat pipes maximizing efficiency with the correct selection of macroscopic geometry (tube diameter and length) and microscopic (groove). Particular attention was paid to the choice of fluids. The analysis and tests were focused on low toxicity fluids that can allow, but is not limited to, use of these devices in inhabited space modules. In fact the systems studied could also be adopted to heat the home environment increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer systems (from the source ‚Äì boiler, solar concentrator, etc. ‚Äì to the room to warm up). The use of the phase change of a fluid with its simple heating are able to allow, in similar conditions, such as the type of fluid used and the dimensions of the domestic heating system, the transport of a greater quantity of heat and also energy savings. Among the projects born after the research and development activities in thermal the field we can include: RAH (Renewable passive heat system), HEAT (Heat Exchanging pAssive Technology), ARTE (Advanced Research for passive Thermal Exchange) and INWIP (Innovative Wickless Heat Pipe Systems for Ground and space applications). The Argotec know-how is also extended to the design of electronic power system, the development of on board computers and on board software, the choice and integration of COTS components and finally to customization following the specific characteristics imposed by the project. In addition to these skills Argotec also has knowledge of ESA and NASA (ECSS and SSP) standards, and familiarity with safety and integration processes with the ISS required by NASA for all experiments and systems that fly onboard the ISS.

This is same description as with the more common interest rate swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled payments. A ZCS takes its name from a zero coupon bond which has no interim coupon payments and only a single payment at maturity. A ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has a single payment date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determining payments is, as a result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs. Extended Description Zero coupon swaps (ZCSs) hedged by the more commonly traded interest rate swaps (IRSs) introduce cross- gamma into an IRD portfolio. As such, and due to correlation between different instruments, ZCSs are required to have a pricing adjustment, to equate their value to IRSs under a no arbitrage principle. Otherwise this is considered rational pricing. This adjustment is referred to in literature as the zero coupon swap convexity adjustment (ZCA). Valuation and Pricing ZCSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a day count convention of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365). A vanilla ZCS is the term used for standardised ZCSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency. A vanilla ZCS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' often referencing an -IBOR index. The net present value (PV) of a vanilla ZCS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market ZCS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further under Rational pricing. Calculating the fixed leg requires discounting the known, single cashflow by an appropriate discount factor: :P_\\\\text{fixed} = C_n v_n where C_n is the fixed cashflow, v_n is the discount factor associated with the date of the payment indexed by variable n. Calculating the floating leg is more complicated due to the compounding effect which has to be applied ahead of the final cashflow payment: :P_\\\\text{float} = N v_n \\\\left ( \\\\prod_{j=1}^{n_2} (1 + r_j d_j) - 1 \\\\right ) where n_2 is the number of periods applicable to the floating leg and r_j are the forecast -IBOR index rates of the appropriate currency of those periods. v_n is the terminal discount factors associated with the payment date at maturity. The PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then: :P_\\\\text{ZCS} = P_\\\\text{fixed} - P_\\\\text{float} Historically IRSs and ZCSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the -IBOR rates. This has been called 'self-discounted'. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them. It became more apparent with the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical collateral of the IRSs was needed. Post crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing framework is the multi-curves framework where forecast -IBOR rates and discount factors exhibit disparity. Note that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See Multi-curve framework for the math. and Financial economics ¬ß Derivative pricing for further context. Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on credit support annexes (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. Since the basis spread between LIBOR rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each LIBOR tenor used in floating rate derivative legs.Multi-Curve Valuation Approaches and their Application to Hedge Accounting according to IAS 39, Dr. Dirk Schubert, KPMG Currency basis will require additional curves. Regarding the curve build, the old framework, of a single self discounted curve was \\"bootstrapped\\", exactly returning the prices of selected instruments. Under the new framework, the various curves are best fitted ‚Äî as a \\"set\\" ‚Äî to observed market data prices. See M. Henrard (2014). Interest Rate Modelling in the Multi-Curve Framework: Foundations, Evolution and Implementation. Palgrave Macmillan See section 3 of Marco Bianchetti and Mattia Carlicchi (2012). Interest Rates after The Credit Crunch: Multiple- Curve Vanilla Derivatives and SABR The complexities of modern curvesets mean that there may not be discount factors available for a specific -IBOR index curve. These curves are known as 'forecast only' curves and only contain the information of a forecast -IBOR index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve: :r_j = \\\\frac{1}{d_j} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_j} - 1 \\\\right ) where x_{i-1} and x_{i} are the start and end discount factors associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular -IBOR index in a given currency. To price the mid-market cashflow value of a ZCS the above formula is re-arranged to: :C_n = N \\\\left ( \\\\prod_{j=1}^{n_2} (1 + r_j d_j) - 1 \\\\right ) In the event old methodologies are applied and the discount factors x_k are used assuming contiguity of compounding periods the above reduces to: :C_n = N \\\\left ( \\\\frac{x_0}{x_{n_2}} - 1 \\\\right ) During the life of the swap the same valuation technique is used, but since, over time, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, the PV of the swap will deviate from its initial value. Therefore, the swap will be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. The way these changes in value are reported is the subject of IAS 39 for jurisdictions following IFRS, and FAS 133 for U.S. GAAP. Swaps are marked to market by debt security traders to visualize their inventory at a certain time. Uses and Risks As with interest rate swaps, zero coupon swaps expose users to many different types of financial risk Predominantly they expose the user to market risks. The value of an interest rate swap will change as market interest rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as delta risk. Other specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are basis risks (where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another) and reset risks (where the publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes are subject to daily fluctuation). Interest rate swaps also exhibit gamma risk whereby their delta risk increases or decreases as market interest rates fluctuate. Uncollateralised interest rate swaps (that are those executed bilaterally without a credit support annex (CSA) in place) expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and credit risks. Funding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. Credit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps expose the users to collateral risks. Depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. Credit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. Due to regulations set out in the Basel III Regulatory Frameworks trading interest rate derivatives commands a capital usage. Dependent upon their specific nature interest rate swaps might command more capital usage and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users. Reputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators. Hedging interest rate swaps can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes. Quotation and Market-Making The quotation (i.e. price of a ZCS given by a market-maker) for a ZCS, which is often itself specified by its start and end date parameters, as well as the notional size and the benchmark -IBOR index in the sought currency, can be provided in one of two ways; either as a directly specified fixed cashflow amount or as fixed rate which determines that same cashflow value. This type of fixed rate is often called an internal rate of return (IRR) due to its familiar calculation. :C_n = N \\\\left ( \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{f} \\\\right) ^{fD_n} -1 \\\\right ) where f is the frequency of the fixed IRR payments per year, D_n is the full day count fraction between the start and end date of the ZCS and R is the IRR. It is rare that the IRR is not quoted with an annual frequency to simplify the formula and minimise other discrepancies. Also note a further cause of common error is to used a rounded D_n as opposed to the exact D_n. For ZCS encompassing a whole number of years a whole number can be taken as D_n, when in fact due to business days and day count conventions this might not necessarily be the exact value. The market- making of ZCSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency. Trivia On its December 2014 statistics release, the Bank for International Settlements reported that interest rate swaps were the largest component of the global OTC derivative market representing 60% of it, with the notional amount outstanding in OTC interest rate swaps of $381 trillion, and the gross market value of $14 trillion. Interest rate swaps can be traded as an index through the FTSE MTIRS Index.

Citation dynamics describes the number of references received by the article or other scientific work over time. The citation dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2‚Äì3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on preferential attachment. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual. The dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to technological progress, the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the citation dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the reference list of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references. Model It has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted power-law. The probability that paper i is cited at time t after publication as: : \\\\Pi_{i}(t) = \\\\eta_{i}c_i^tP_{i}(t) where \\\\Pi_{i}(t) serves as the outcome variable for each particular paper i at time t.

Life and works Little is known about Lari's early life and career. He is thought to be of either Persian or Indian origin. Lari might suggest he was from Lar, a town south-east of Shiraz. He was a student of DÃ≤jÃ≤alƒÅl al-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad al-DawƒÅnƒ´, a noted Persian scholar who wrote the first treatise on the poet Hafez's works, and who is known to have visited Lar. Lari's Kitab Fut≈´·∏• al-·∏§aramayn (Revelations of the Two Holy Sanctuaries), written in Persian, is dedicated to Muzaffar al-Din ibn Mahmud Shah, who ruled Gujarat from 1511 to 1526. It is a guidebook for the Haj pilgrimage. The manuscript comprises 45 leaves with writing in two columns of naskh script and eighteen illuminated (but stylised, rather than accurate) illustrations, including holy sites in Medina, scenes between Medina and Mecca, and the various stages of the Hajj in Mecca. The illuminations are with ink, opaque watercolour and gold on paper. It contains a detailed depictions of the Kaaba, indicating the areas assigned for the worship of the various sects of Islam, the named entrance doors to the sanctum, minarets, and two rows of colonnades. While traditionally pilgrim manuals desisted from human depictions, preferring to illustrate landscapes and holy sites only, Lari's miniatures are an exception, with rendered people appearing in some of them. Lari's mystical verse, meanwhile, describes the ceremonies of the Hajj and their essence. Lari's attention to architectural detail, use of the colour palette and expert draughtsmanship have been lauded. Indeed, his painting of Mecca's Sacred Mosque became a widely reproduced image for several centuries. His miniatures showing Mount Arafat as well as mahmals were re-crafted into Haj certificates that were in use even in the 18th century. At least twelve manuscripts have survived to date. All of them contain illustrations of the various stages of the Hajj, with each station labelled. Several of the manuscripts are known from their colophons to have been produced in Mecca. Pages from some copies have appeared at various auctions. The earliest copy now extant is a copy made in Mecca in 1544; it now resides in the British Library. Lari's original document has been copied and re-illustrated over the centuries, and editions have been found in Turkey, Persia and India. The later versions often have misspellings and inconsistencies, either because the scribe was unskilled or because Lari's ornate language was difficult. Inspired by his teacher's example, Lari wrote a commentary on ibn al-FƒÅrid's Kasida, called al-Taiyya al-kubra. In this, he attempted to show the coherence between orthodox Islamic mysticism and Aristotelian thought. Lari is thought to have died either in 1521 or 1526-7.

The thin red tiles visible on the south side of the tower are thought to mark the day by day progress of the workmen. Major renovation of the tower was carried out in 1996 when seven of the eight gargoyles were replaced with replicas carved by Rattee and Kett. These represent opposites: Life and Death; Saint and the Devil: King and Queen, and a Lion and a Man. The clock was installed to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897; it was restored in 1991. The buttresses supporting the nave date to the 15th-century, while those supporting the chancel are 19th-century.Harkness, Peter All Saints...and Sinners: The Story of a Village Church, Privately Published (1999) pg 5 The roof is of Welsh slate with coped gables, while the structure is built of flint and ironstone rubble walls with ashlar dressed stone and buttresses. The 14th and 15th century fenestration is in the Perpendicular style.Photographs of the gargoyles on All Saints Church, Willian - waymarking.com Inside the church The tomb of Edward (died 1624) and Joanna Lacon (died 1625) in the chancel Tomb of Rev John Chapman (died 1624) and Anne Chapman (died 1633) Tomb of Thomas and Lucy Wilson (1656) The church's interior has a 19th-century timber barrel roof above both the nave and chancel, while the latter still has its original corbel masks and carved seats. The nave is high and light owing to work done in 1866-70 when the window opposite the porch was added and the roof raised. The two windows facing each other date to about 1430 - but the stained glass in them only dates to 1918. The walls are from about 1100 to 1150. The free-standing communion table has a prominent position and behind it is a carving of an elephant and castle on the president's chair, which was made in 1974 using medieval woodwork already existing in the church; on a side panel is the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Recent research suggests that these carvings were originally made in about 1475 for St Andrew's church in Biggleswade and were brought to Willian in about 1830. There is a monumental brass to Richard Golden (died 1446), priest at Willian 1416-1466, while the walls are adorned with good quality monuments, those in the chancel being to Edward and Joan Lacon (died 1625 and 1624), John Chapman (died 1624) and Thomas Wilson (died 1656).All Saints, Willian - Church Monuments Society The latter is a fine and rare example. These monuments were cleaned and some were repainted in 1974. The newer of the two lecterns was given in memory of Samuel Valentine, who died in 1974; the older one was given in 1870 by Thomas Legh Claughton, the Bishop of Rochester in whose diocese Willian then lay. The original 15th century rood screen has been removed.‚Ä¢Doubleday, A, The Victoria History of the County of Hertford, (1912) pg 179 Above the tower arch are the Royal Arms which were probably placed there during the restoration of 1870. At the base of the tower the Ellacombe Chime bell-ringing apparatus on the wall enables one person to ring all six bells. The oldest bell in its original state is dated 1662. The organ was made by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1864, and was refurbished in 1986. The Victorian baptismal font is believed to be the fourth in the church. Its predecessor was taken to the Rectory where it was used as a plant container.

German childhood in World War II describes how the Second World War, as well as experiences related to it, directly or indirectly impacted the life of children born in that era. In Germany, these children became known as Kriegskinder (war children), a term that came into use due to a large number of scientific and popular science publications which have appeared increasingly since the 1990s. They describe the same phenomena from different perspectives, using diverse methods and various stylistic means. The literature on this subject has not yet been able to produce a universal and binding definition. However, there is consensus that the impact of war on children can be felt decades later, often increasing with advancing age, and that at times the impact can be passed on mute to subsequent generations.  \\"War child\\"  \\"War does not stop when the weapons fall silent.\\" Into this simple formula German author Sabine Bode condensed the impact of war on human health. In 2015, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of Germany's capitulation and liberation from the Nazis ‚Äì Victory in Europe Day ‚Äì she had been invited by Phoenix (German TV station) to discuss \\"how we feel the war to this day\\" with respect to grandchildren of war. Together with Katrin Himmler, Randi Crott and Jens Orback, Sabine Bode participated in a round table discussion. None of the participants provided a definition of the two main terms, children of war and grand-children of war. Katrin Himmler, however, named an important characteristic when she stated that \\"by far the most\\" war children in Germany were impacted \\"not only by the war\\", but \\"also by the pedagogy of the National Socialists\\". Author Matthias Lohre had already attempted a definition as early as 2014: \\"For those born between 1930 and 1945, the term war children has become understood as youth who were too young for direct participation in the war, but old enough to suffer from hunger, expulsion and bomb attacks, loss of family members, separation and fear of death.\\" Children playing in ruins in Berlin (1948) The concept is unquestionably aimed at a generation that spent part of its childhood in Germany during the Second World War, \\"for whom ‚Äì without necessarily being threatened by organized annihilation ‚Äì experiences of violence, separation and loss were, at least to some degree, impacting their life\\". Not all authors agree which age groups to include. Some writers want to include children born shortly after the war because even in 1950, according to journalist Sabine Bode, \\"nine million children in West Germany lived in conditions that were inadequate, often unworthy for humans.\\" Years later, war children and their younger siblings still played in ruins left over from bombings. There is also no agreement at the other end of the scale as to what birth years to include. While Matthias Lohre and others include the children born in 1930, Michael Ermann restricts the term in his studies, referring to the \\"fate of the generation of non-Jewish Germans born in the Second World War\\". Jewish children, who were neither deported nor murdered, are generally not included in this definition. For them the term survivors is used as they were exposed to additional and very specific threats to their lives which necessitated living in hiding. Anne Frank describes this in her book The Diary of Anne Frank which was published in German in 1950. It can not be assumed that the term has comparable meanings in languages of other European countries. For example, the English term war children, as well as the French term enfant de la guerre, define the concept narrower, as a synonym for Besatzungskind ‚Äì a child of a native mother and a father who is member of an occupying military force ‚Äì describing implications associated with that situation. Additional terms describing the various aspects and experiences of the war child generation, besides Besatzungskind, have been developed in Germany as well. These include, for example, the children of Lebensborn (an association in Nazi Germany whose goal was to raise the birth rate of racially pure Aryan children), the children of forced laborers, or the so-called Wolf children who grew up without parents in the Baltics and had to hide their origins. Additional issues were raised with respect to war orphans or children of war- related rape. Further, the high number of children of married parents who had lost their father in the war or had never met him represent another group which has specific characteristics, as well as those children who had not met their fathers until after the end of the war or after their release from prisoner of war camps. An extensive amount of literature deals specifically with the fate of Jewish children, like the Kindertransport which brought Jewish children to the UK, the rescue of Jewish children by Youth Aliyah Child Rescue, or the support of these children by the Swiss charity organization for emigrant children. Finally, there is another group of children who are usually not considered war children because of their special affiliation with Heimatvertriebene, Germans who were forced to flee after being expelled from areas that became part of other countries during post-war restructuring. These expellees were, in contrast to the war children in general, a \\"public topic\\" during the post-war period \\"in the West of the divided country.\\" Still another group are the war children of the First World War. They are generally not included in the relevant literature, although they should also be considered as such. After years of efforts to bring together what the war children have in common, psychoanalyst Michael Ermann, in his farewell lecture on the occasion of his retirement in March 2009, came to the following conclusion: \\"The 'German war children' do not exist. Their fates are much too diverse. [...] All of this requires individual consideration rather than a generalization.\\" But if there is something that \\"connects the different fates ‚Äì the ones in the East, the West, the North and the South, the children of the night bombings and the refugee children\\" ‚Äì then it would be a striking \\"lack of fright and consternation about one's own fate!\\"  History  In 2003 ‚Äì almost sixty years after the end of the war ‚Äì Ermann, who describes himself as a \\"typical war child\\", launched Project War Childhood at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He was joined by a prominent international scientific advisory board. In 2009 the project was completed with a series of scientific publications. The Inability to Mourn, a book published by Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich in 1967 that deals with the consequences of the war experience, found broad public attention among Germans. Even though the authors were primarily focusing on adults, they provided an impetus for later research on war children where the symptoms described by the Mitscherlichs were also found. The inability to mourn, they wrote, had produced a behaviour based on \\"denial\\" which may have led to \\"self-confidence more uncertain than it could have been.\\" It was not until the late 1980s, after 20 more years had passed, that the topic of childhood of war came into the public discourse in Germany. Why so much time had to pass is attributed to various factors. Ermann recalls \\"feelings of guilt [...] as a result of the Holocaust\\" and the \\"refusal to remember during the years of the Wirtschaftswunder\\", the economic miracle after the war. Finally, \\"trauma-specific defense mechanisms\\" should be taken into account. The journalist Hilke Lorenz said that the war children had fallen into a \\"history gap\\". And the author Alexandra Senfft, the granddaughter of the war criminal Hanns Ludin, recalled the taboos: \\"To deal with the crimes of one's own relatives hurts, it makes you afraid and sad.\\" Even \\"thinking about the worst was a taboo in my family\\". \\"Politically more volatile\\" was probably the feared \\"accusation by Shoa survivors\\" that \\"looking at war children\\" could lead to \\"relativize the murder of the Jews\\". In 2005, at the first interdisciplinary conference in Frankfurt ‚Äì which had devoted itself to the war children ‚Äì the representative of the Jewish congregation \\"distanced himself\\" from such a proposal. The answer clarified that \\"it was not a matter of opening up a ‚Äòvictim competition‚Äô but, on the contrary, classifying one's own differentiated experiences into the European memory, as well as identifying the suffering due to the silencing of the ‚Äòdeeds‚Äô by the parent generation.\\" It is no coincidence therefore that Sabine Bode ‚Äì in her book about grand-children of war ‚Äì addressed the question of \\"how perpetrators became victims\\". in a separate section. Psychological testing was absent in the discussion until 1980 when the diagnosis of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was included in the DSM III, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Within less than 10 years thereafter, the publications on the psychological consequences of war on childhood increased in Germany. Since then, numerous authors have reported very personal accounts about their own childhood, have accepted this subject more generally, or have begun to publish scientific studies. Bode noted that while 70 years after the end of the war an \\"academic review\\" had taken place ‚Äì by representatives of various scientific disciplines ‚Äì but that only recently an \\"emotional process\\" had begun. Katrin Himmler is also convinced that \\"we have not yet processed this within families\\". Anyone who tries to do this will sooner or later be confronted with the question of their own identity. Christa M√ºller drew attention to the fact that the \\"path to a mature national as well as individual identity [...] requires a self-critical examination of the far-reaching influences of the events in National Socialist Germany, in the Second World War and in the post- war period\\". For Raed Saleh, a German politician, the discussions about the term revolve around a question that \\"remains unresolved\\": \\"How does Germany define its national identity\\"? He suggests that we would have to \\"redefine\\" it: \\"Politicians of the Alternative for Germany party are demanding to end memory culture in Germany, and they are not the only ones.\\" On February 18, 2017, during a radio program titled There must be an end to it ‚Äì Remembrance Culture in Germany ‚Äì Ulrich Gineiger published a report about the pros and cons of this issue. In this report, representatives of both positions were heard. In the foreground were \\"older people [...] who spoke about their traumatic experiences during the Nazi regime\\" as well as how they remembered it in later years. In addition, the heads of various cultural institutions and memorial sites talked about their experiences with their visitors. The project Stolpersteine (Stumbling Blocks) by the artist Gunter Demnig which is receiving international attention also played a role in the documentation.  Raising of youth during the Nazi era  The raising of children and youth during the National Socialist era was the lens through which not all, but most war children in Germany experienced the war and its affects. In 1934 one of the most powerful publishing houses of that period released a guidebook by Johanna Haarer ‚Äì one of the well-known Women in Nazi Germany ‚Äì on the topic of infant care. This book, The German Mother and her First Child, was in its tenth edition at the end of the war. It is still on the market, with changes that obscure its origin and ideology, not revealing the year of its first appearance. In her critical analysis of this and another book on child-rearing by Haarer, Sigrid Chamberlain concludes that child-raising and education in Nazi Germany and the early post-war years are characterized by coldness, harshness, and indifference. She views these theories as a \\"seamless transition into the ideology and the institutions of the Nazi state\\", stating that it is \\"time\\" to deal with the fact that \\"the majority of those born during the Third Reich and the post-war years were released into life with early Nazi ideology, without ever realizing this fact and its possible consequences.\\" In 1977 the concept of \\"Black Pedagogy\\", introduced by sociologist Katharina Rutschky, was established, summarizing ‚Äì among other concepts ‚Äì the child-raising and educational methods of this period. While Chamberlain had investigated the question of how it was possible to carry the ideology of the time into the nurseries, Hans-Peter de Lorent has been researching the socialization in the educational systems since the 1980s. Already politically active as a student, he recalls that \\"in 1968, for example, as speaker of the student counsel, I called for participation in the Sternmarsch, a march into Bonn ‚Äì then the German capital ‚Äì to protest against the proposed German Emergency Acts\\". In 1981 as \\"editor of the Hamburger Lehrerzeitung\\", a magazine for teachers, he had begun \\"to publish a series called Schooling under the Swastika\\" that dealt specifically with teachers who \\"resisted\\" the Nazi regime. In 1991, in a review of a book by Lutz van Dijk about resistance of teachers during the Nazi era, the educational scientist Reiner Lehberger stated that, as early as 1936, 97 per cent of teachers belonged to the Nazi Teachers Association and 32 per cent were members of the Nazi Party. Van Dijk's critical view of the twelve years of the Nazi era shows ‚Äì according to Lehberger ‚Äì that in the early years, \\"expressions of indignation [...] were mostly punished with reprimands\\", whereas \\"during the war they were considered as 'Wehrkraftzersetzung'\\", subversion of the war effort, and \\"not rarely endowed with the death penalty.\\" In 2016, after years of research, using the city of Hamburg as an example, de Lorent published an 800-page book on the profiles of those teachers who taught war and post-war children in the schools of Germany. As a former school superintendent he was able to draw on earlier contacts who became very helpful in his research. Based on the profiles of 42 teachers, De Lorent not only described generally how \\"Nazi teachers made a career after the war\\", but he also described details, using a Hamburg physical education teacher as an example, who had lit synagogues during the Nazi period and who beat his students after the war The fact that pupils were still beaten by their teachers in the post-war years was not an exception, but the rule. \\"The so-called De-nazification had largely failed in the school system\\", wrote journalist Uwe Bahnsen in his discussion of de Lorent's book. Further information about the socialization of children during the Nazi period can be found in two online portals. In addition to the NS Documentation Centre, the city of Cologne has put the Nazi Youth Project on the web. In this way, a vast amount of richly compiled historical material regarding the Second World War is made accessible to the general public. On the page Youth in Germany 1918 ‚Äì 1945, the various efforts to influence the war children ‚Äì such as in schools, camps, or the deportation of children ‚Äì are brought together, dedicating a chapter to each topic. The collaborative portal Lebendiges Museum Online (LeMO), Living Museum Online provides, in addition to other topics, thousands of pages, pictures, audio and video files about the Second World War and the post-war years, among them, for example, the poster Youth Serves the Leader. The post-war years, described as collapsed society are documented under the title Life in Ruins.  Experiencing the war  \\"What would be the proportion of those who experienced horrible things and those who were lucky\\", Bode asked in 2009, four years after the Congress In Frankfurt. According to Bode, the experts had been struggling since then \\"to come to estimate that one half had a normal childhood and the other half had not\\". For the latter group, it was assumed that 25 per cent [experienced] \\"short-term or isolated trauma and that a further 25 per cent were exposed to persistent and multiple traumatizing experiences.\\" According to Bauer, \\"many war children still seem to be striving to explain their war experiences as trivial and normal\\". This is an almost unanimous conclusion, in the media as well as in science and research. Matthias Lohre collected \\"typical phrases\\", like \\"that's the way it was\\" or \\"everyone experienced that\\", used by war children to regularly play down their own experiences. Ermann calls it the \\"speechlessness\\" of war children, that he sees as \\"a counterpart to the lack of interest\\" by the public towards this fate. Ermann refers in this context to a \\"myth of invulnerability of children\\". It was linked to the \\"ideology of heroism in National Socialism\\" which in an \\"unspoken way resonated in the processing of the Second World War, the Nazi period, and in post-war Germany. 'German' children are born to withstand hardship, and these children are not vulnerable. But if they are harmed, then they are not seen in their pain and suffering, but in their bravery with which they overcome their injuries.\\" The reality was different, as psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann reported in detail in her lecture in Bad Krozingen in 2006. And it was different for each of the war children. They brought with them individual preconditions and lived in different parts of Germany which were not all equally affected by the war. While some cities were laid in ruins and ashes, others were spared. While some children experienced hunger, there was enough food in other places. While some survived firestorms, others did not know what that was. Not everyone knew about the nights in the bunkers during the air raids, not all were bombed, entombed by debris or lost their physical integrity. Those who were surrounded by family experienced the war differently from those who were left abandoned after the loss of family. Some children witnessed the rape of their mother or sister. And those whose homeland was preserved could not imagine the distress of the expellees. Unknown is the number of children who were not spared the experience of death. \\"That's the way it was.\\" Close your eyes and get through ‚Äì was the motto.  Consequences of childhood during war  When the war was over, the war children were confronted with their growing insight into the culpable entanglement of the parent generation. Emerging questions met denial or reactions of guilt and shame. Through the media they learned about the Nuremberg trials and were also witnessing societal efforts to restore a kind of normality which looked very different in the two parts of the country after the division of Germany. In addition to Bode, Ermann considers the war children to be a \\"generation of the inconspicuous\\" that has \\"produced only a small number of significant personalities\\". Beyond such a view on the consequences of war on individual children ‚Äì a fairly typical one ‚Äì some authors also look at the possible societal consequences. One of these authors is Lloyd deMause. As a pioneer and one of the most important representatives of Psychohistory ‚Äì a theory which is considered controversial ‚Äì he connected the individual experience of the war children to the consequences that have broader societal impact. In several publications he analyzed the \\"expression of childhood trauma in politics\\" and came to the following daring conclusion: A vacancy in the literature regarding the war children remains. Neither Ermann nor other authors refer to the fact that the war generation and the generation of the so-called Counterculture of the 1960s movement have common experiences. Rudi Dutschke, one of their most prominent representatives, was a war child.  Characteristics of war children  The war children's experiences before the war, and their various experiences during the war are different for each of them. Yet, despite such diversity, there are similarities which characterize them. Age plays an important role in the processing of experiences. Andrea Bauer summarized the results of various studies and concluded that \\"children between 5 and 9 years of age experience the greatest vulnerability as they are very aware of the events, but do not yet have sufficient coping strategies\\". Moreover, Bauer states that children interpret their experience \\"more through the direct contact with their reference persons\\" rather than through \\"the event itself\\" ‚Äì and how the reference persons \\"explain the events to the child, and in turn, how they interpret them for themselves\\". In addition to the characteristics of war children already described, various features or symptoms can be identified. However, there are subgroups of war children about whom we still know \\"nothing\\", German psychoanalyst Hartmut Radebold said in an interview in 2010. He mentioned, as an example, \\"the children who have been sent across Europe to protect them from the war\\" or those \\"who were placed into orphanages after the war\\". In 2014, the German TV station S√ºdwestrundfunk provided little-known details about the childhood of some war children with the publication of two documentaries. On December 7, 2014, a documentary film by Ina Held, titled Journey Into an Intact World: German War Children in Switzerland was broadcast. These children were often called \\"Swiss Children\\". Subsequently, Gerd B√∂hmer published the film \\"Escape Routes ‚Äì When Jewish Refugees Wanted to Go to Switzerland\\". He had made this film together with students from L√∂rrach in order to \\"revisit the topic and create cross-generational interest\\". = Attributes = At times Ermann speaks of \\"quirks\\" when describing typical experiences or behaviors of war children. When these behaviours do not have symptomatic characteristics, they have long been regarded as personal whims rather than the consequences of war experiences. In addition, a number of \\"abnormalities\\" were found ‚Äì also below the threshold which makes people seek professional help ‚Äì such as \\"feelings of unfamiliarity\\" or \\"relationship disorders\\" or even a \\"feeling of great emptiness\\", and the \\"impression not to live one's own life, standing beside oneself somehow\\". \\"Early parentification\\" is occasionally mentioned, as well as an \\"oppressive sense of responsibility\\". Often the experiences of the war had \\"crept into the sense of identity as blind spots\\", Sabine Bode noted. In this context, she pointed to protective factors: \\"Most of the war children succeeded in keeping their memories of fright at bay, especially by immersing themselves in work.\\" Luise Reddemann also recalled factors that protect them: \\"While it is true that traumatic experiences can cause damage and leave scars, it is also true that resilience can prevent people from carrying life-long trauma-induced injuries. These factors should not be overlooked, as has happened for a long time.\\" Radebold, who sees himself as a war child, reminds of \\"the so-called egosyntonic behavior[s] of the war children. These are behaviours we all know: being thrifty, working hard and diligently, planning, organizing, being altruistic, looking after others and not oneself\\". But, on the other hand, they \\"did not learn to take care of their body\\". = Symptoms and disorders = Some war children became ill, some recovered, others did not. Still others experienced first symptoms later, at an advanced age. According to Ermann, war children \\"as adults are generally more at risk of suffering from psychological disorders than others\\". Even losing the conscious memory does not guarantee protection from illness. The Body Does Not Forget was the title of an article based on a comment by Erman, published by the German magazine Der Spiegel in 2009. At the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst and author spoke about a long-term study in which several scientists participated, stating that it had shown \\"a higher than expected\\" number of patients suffering from consequences of the war: \\"Long-term physical damage due to poor nutrition, problems with self-care, psychosomatic complaints, loneliness, escape into achievement, empathy disorders, identity, and relationship disorders.\\" Besides Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) ‚Äì which many authors view as a possible consequence of war ‚Äì Ermann added \\"latent symptoms\\" which he had identified in preparation for his research project: \\"Many still have nightmares of attacks, traps, violence, struggle, escape. Others are torn from sleep with an ancient feeling for which they have a personal formula: 'The Russians are coming'. Others experience depression, low confidence, anxiety, somatization or conversion. There are sometimes strange symptoms: feeling cold or recurring fever, agitation and restlessness or sudden panic, numbness, or the feeling of being out of control. Today we recognize in such symptoms the traces of flight-or-fight responses, recurring memories that express themselves in the body, memories of the incomprehensible.\\" For decades, before the development of the trauma concept, all of these symptoms have been traditionally described as \\"hysterical desire neurosis\\" or they were traced to \\"hereditary vulnerability\\". One year after the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann addressed her younger colleagues during a lecture regarding therapeutic consequences: In 2015, Luise Reddemann's book about psychotherapy regarding children of war and grandchildren of war was published. There she addressed the question of how the consequences of a childhood during war can be recognized and dealt with in detail. = War children in old age = Ermann contributes, among other reasons, the fact that this topic is \\"researched and debated\\" 70 years later to the age of war children. He states that \\"neuro- physiological processes\\" are making memories \\"that have been hidden for a long time re-appear\\". He is stating further that \\"psychological defences collapse\\" as a result of age, and \\"everything that has been protective for decades ‚Äì a person's family and job ‚Äì disappears\\". The second interdisciplinary congress about war children took place in M√ºnster in 2013, eight years after the first one. Among the many topics discussed, the age of the war children was addressed as well. If \\"life experience ‚Äì beyond all research ‚Äì teaches that remembering characterizes old age\\", Insa Fooken, a German professor focusing on aging, confirmed this general knowledge from the perspective of developmental psychology. \\"It is often not until old age that the full extent of the consequences becomes visible.\\" Radebold, as Ermann, has researched war children and specializes in the psychotherapy of the elderly. He wondered how the war children would cope \\"when they become older, eventually needing care or support, and thus having to give up their independence\\". He reminded \\"professional groups working in psycho-social and old-age related fields\\" of the urgent need to \\"provide updated knowledge and information\\". In 2013, German broadcaster ARD presented a documentary by Dorothe D√∂rholt about war children in old age. Journalist Thilo Wydra titled this programme in the German newspaper Tagesspiegel Unforgettable, Unprocessed: The Fear in One's Head. German TV station Ph√∂nix broadcast a rerun in 2015, focusing on the return of traumatizing experiences in old age: \\"One third of German pensioners was seriously traumatized during the war. Many of them are helplessly exposed to images and memories of war which are reappearing in old age.\\" War-related traumata and anxiety-provoking memories are now being addressed in old age homes. \\"Historical knowledge\\" is necessary and \\"not leaving old people alone or lonely\\" ‚Äì is the belief of one caregiver for the elderly. An online platform by the name Age and Trauma ‚Äì Giving Space to the Unheard is addressing \\"elderly people, their relatives, professionals and institutions\\" by embracing the trauma of old people in general and the war children of the Second World War specifically, recognizing that time does not heal all wounds. The project Old People and Traumata ‚Äì Understanding, Testing and Multiplication of Interventions and Training Opportunities, was funded by the Ministry of Health, Emancipation, Care and Old Age of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, between 2013 and 2016.  Children of war children  The shadows of the past are still noticeable in generations following the war children. Some of the descendants now call themselves grandchildren of war for they have long since realized that they are burdened by something, even though they have grown up protected and prosperous. According to Matthias Lohre, it is high time that generations of war children and grandchildren \\"come to talk about the experiences of hardship, death and helplessness\\" before more of the war children are dying. \\"Yet, the Germans who survived the Second World War as children seemed almost indestructible.\\"  Organizations, groups, and websites  The more the topic war children became public, the more organizations in several locations in Germany have been founded, focusing on this subject. Some have since disappeared, others have been launched. Probably all of them can be found on the Internet, but not every website is an organization. Some of them are self-help groups with the goal to support, promote contacts, or organize group discussions. Some are directed exclusively to war children or grandchildren of war, while others address both groups. Typically these organizations consider those born after 1950 to be the grandchildren of war, although many of them are brothers and sisters of the war children and do not belong to the next generation. Other organizations have primarily devoted themselves to the support of scientific research.  Documentary films  The following films have not been translated into the English language.

It is the tallest structure in the city. The coal tipple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History In 1869, the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway purchased the river frontage at this location and placed their operations at this site. structures located here included a turntable, a grain elevator, an engine house, a freight warehouse, an icehouse, a depot, and a water tank. The railway underwent a series of mergers, and was eventually obtained by the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, although the subsidiary retained an independent identity. In 1902, railroad began car ferry service at this site. the In 1924-25, the railroad upgraded its Grand Haven facilities, building a 50,000 gallon water tower and this coaling station. When in use, the structure contained a hoist that provided coal to locomotives through the two steel chutes projecting from the structure. An electric motor in the adjacent engine house powered the system. In 1933, Grand Trunk Railroad transferred its ferry service to Muskegon in 1933, the coal tipple fell into disuse. In 1949, the ferry dock in Muskegon collapsed and Grand Trunk briefly re-activated the site. However, diesels replaced steam locomotives in the 1950s and no further operations took place at the tower. The steel hardware was eventually removed. Grand Trunk ceased passenger operations to Grand Haven in 1955, and in 1975 it ended freight service and abandoned the track. Description The Grand Trunk Western Railroad Grand Haven Coal Tipple is a massive structure built from reinforced concrete, standing 79 feet high and covering an area 38 feet by 30 feet. The structure includes a large coal storage section along with a small gabled unit above that at one time housed the hoist machinery. Adjacent to the main structure is small single-story reinforced concrete power house building. Also located in the park is the Pere Marquette Railway Locomotive No. 1223, separately listed on the National Register. The first floor of the coal tipple is constructed from ten concrete piers that define three bays on the longer sides and two on the shorter. The bays are composed of arches running from pier to pier. Some bays are entirely open, while others are filled with a concrete panel. A wide horizontal concrete belt course above the arches defines the base of the structure's second level. This level has bays aligned with those on the first story, with all containing recessed rectangular planes without windows. This level originally contained coal storage. The wider central bay continues upward to form a third story with a gabled concrete roof.

Historical Constitutional Status of FATA  Before 25th Amendment to Constitution of Pakistan, FATA was federally administrated special territory of Pakistan and was included among the territories of Pakistan in Article 1. FATA was governed primarily through the Frontier Crimes Regulation 1901. It was administered directly by Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in his capacity as an agent to the President of Pakistan, under the overall supervision of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions in Islamabad. Laws framed by the Parliament did not apply there, unless were ordered by the President, who was also empowered to issue regulations for the peace and good government of the tribal areas.  Representation in Parliament  People of FATA were represented in the Parliament of Pakistan by their elected representatives both in National Assembly of Pakistan and the Senate of Pakistan. FATA had 12 members in the National Assembly and 8 members in the Senate. FATA had no representation in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.  FATA Secretariat  Decisions related to development planning in tribal areas were taken by the FATA section of the KP Planning and Development Department, and implemented by KP Government. The FATA Secretariat was set up in 2002, headed by the Secretary FATA. Four years later, in 2006, the Civil Secretariat of FATA was established to take over decision-making functions. = Departments = The six departments of now-defunct FATA Secretariat were as follows: # Administration, Infrastructure & Coordination Department # Finance Department # Law & Order Department # Planning & Development Department # Production & Livelihood Development Department # Social Sectors Department = Directorates = In addition to departments following directorates: * Health * Education * Forestry * Fisheries * Irrigation * Livestock & Dairy Development * Minerals & Technical Education * Agriculture * Sports * Social Welfare * Roads and other infrastructure development  Political Agents  Each Agencies of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas was administered by a Political Agent (PA), assisted by a number of Assistant Political Agents (APA), Tehsildars (administrative head of a tehsil) and Naib Tehsildars (deputy tehsildar).  The Judicial System  All civil and criminal cases in FATA were decided under the Frontier Crimes Regulation 1901 by a jirga (council of elders). Residents of tribal areas had, however, right to approach the FATA Tribunal challenging a decision issued under the 1901 Regulation.  Merger with KP  The FATA was merged into province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by Parliament thorough 25th Amendment to Constitution of Pakistan that was approved in 2018. Under 25th Amendment following changes took effect: * FCR was repealed and replaced with the new Rewaj Regulation for Tribal Areas * Party-based Provincial Government elections were held for the first time in erstwhile-Fata in July 2019. * Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Peshawar High Court was extended to erstwhile-Fata. * Ex-Fata elected their own representatives to the K-P Assembly.

Dry ice color show is the formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) by the reaction of dry ice, the solid form of carbon dioxide (CO2), and water. The reaction between these 2 compounds lower the pH of the solution, therefore making the solution more acidic. Dry ice has a temperature of ‚Äì78.5 ¬∞C (-109.3¬∞F)and normally exist in gas state. By applying universal indicator to the solution, the changing of the pH can be indicated as the color of the solution changes into the contrast color. This experiment is usually conducted as a classroom demonstration of pH and properties of carbon dioxide since the materials required are handful and can be prepared easily. Solid carbon dioxide can cause frostbite when in contact with the skin, by sticking to the moist tissue, such as wet skin or tongue. Solid carbon dioxide undergoes sublimation upon exposure to air. This means it transforms directly from the solid phase to the gaseous phase without melting into liquid.  Description  This experiment provides effective explanation of the acids, bases, indicators reaction and also the properties of carbon dioxide. A large amount of the universal indicator, is first added to water for detecting the change of solution's pH. Then, a few drop of ammonia or sodium hydroxide is mixed into the solution, which changes the color of the solution to a deep green color. Subsequently, the addition of dry ice is required to alter the pH of the solution from basic to acidic condition. Carbonic acid formed when dry ice is added to the liquid sample and lowers the pH. This alters the solution from weakly basic to acidic identified by the color change from green to yellow. Thus, the solution's color gradually turns from deep green into orange color as more hydrogen ions aggregate in the solution. Simultaneously, the cloud of carbon dioxide is generated from the sublimation process, direct change of solid to gas phase, due to the condensation of water vapor in the air.  Chemical explanation  Ammonia is a weak alkali that reacts reversibly with water and alters the pH of the solution into base condition. NH3(g) \\\\+ H2O(l) NH4+(aq) \\\\+ OH‚àí(aq) On the other hand, if sodium hydroxide is added to adjust the pH of the solution to alkali, the color change develops faster than the ammonia as it is a highly reactive compound. 2NaOH(aq) \\\\+ CO2(g) Na2CO3(aq) \\\\+ H2O(l) When dry ice is added to water, it sublimes to carbon dioxide gas rapidly because the solution's temperature is warmer than the dry ice (-78.5 C¬∞ or -109.3 F¬∞). This gas can be observed as bubbles or clouds above the solution. Since the temperature of the gas is so cold, the water vapor containing in the air above the water condenses into small water droplets or cloud suspending in the carbon dioxide gas. CO2(s) CO2(g) However, some of them reacts reversibly with water molecules to form acidic solution symbolized by the production of hydrogen ion. CO2(aq) \\\\+ H2O(l) HCO3‚àí(aq) \\\\+ H+(aq) When acidic solution is mixed together with the alkali present in the solution, the solution, overall, becomes neutral. HCO3‚àí(aq) \\\\+ H+(aq) \\\\+ NH4+(aq) \\\\+ OH‚àí(aq) NH4+(aq) \\\\+ HCO3‚àí(aq) \\\\+ H2O(l) (addition of ammonia) HCO3‚àí(aq) \\\\+ H+(aq) \\\\+ Na+(aq) \\\\+ OH‚àí(aq) Na+(aq) \\\\+ HCO3‚àí(aq) \\\\+ H2O(l) (addition of sodium hydroxide) The color of the solution changes due to the universal indicator, a pH detector. Once the alkali-to-acid universal indicator is incorporated into the solution, the color of the solution changes corresponding to the acidic color of the universal indicator. The color of ammonia and water only is green. However, once the dry ice is added, the solution slowly turns into orange as more hydrogen ions are continuously produced.  Precautions  Dry ice or solid carbon dioxide dramatically contains low temperature solid, which is ‚Äì78.5 ¬∞C (109.3¬∞F), and frostbite production. For safety, touching is restricted with bare skin. Handling dry ice with the appropriate gloves are crucial for protection. Waste contaminated dry ice should be rinsed and left in the fume hood or good ventilator area to allow it to sublime. The vaporization of dry ice can cause irritation to human if ingestion or inhalation occurred. Dry ice can cause headache and shortness of breath in case where a large amount of CO2 gets into the human respiratory tract resulting in the depletion of oxygen.

The sculptures were unveiled in 1997 and were designed and made by Danny Osborne.  History  Statue and companion pieces English sculptor Danny Osborne was commissioned by the Guinness Ireland Group to create a statue commemorating Oscar Wilde, which was unveiled in 1997, by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland. The initial budget of IR¬£20,000 was later increased to IR¬£45,000. Since marble alone was deemed inadequate, the statue was formed from different coloured stones from three continents. The torso is of green nephrite jade from British Columbia, Canada, and pink thulite from Norway. The legs are of Norwegian Blue Pearl granite with the shoes being black Indian charnockite and finished with bronze shoelace tips. The statue also wears a Trinity College tie made from glazed porcelain, and three rings ‚Äì Wilde's wedding ring and two scarabs, one for good luck, the other for bad luck. The statue is mounted with Wilde reclining on a large quartz boulder obtained by Osborne himself from the Wicklow Mountains. The sculpture also includes two pillars flanking the boulder with one pillar having a nude pregnant representation of Wilde's wife Constance Lloyd on top. The other one has a male torso representing Dionysus, the Greek God of drama and wine, atop it. Both flanking sculptures are in bronze and granite, and both pillars have inscriptions from Wilde's poems carved onto them. The inscriptions of the quotes copy the personal handwriting of figures including Seamus Heaney, John B. Keane and Michael D. Higgins. Three people, living at the time near to the artist's West Cork studio, posed as models for the three sculptures. When the statue was unveiled in 1997, it was the first statue commemorating Wilde, who had died 97 years earlier. It received near unanimous praise for the materials used and for its location near his childhood home at 1, Merrion Square. In 2010, the porcelain head of Wilde had to be replaced because cracks were forming on it. The porcelain head was replaced by a new one made of white jadeite.  Impact and significance  In a May 2001 article in the Irish edition of The Sunday Times Mark Keenan commented on the surprisingly long wait for a commemoration of Wilde in his native city and suggested an explanation for the delay, \\"... a decade ago, more conservative elements among the Dublin public may not have dared allow his city to commemorate his name.\\"Keenan, Mark, \\"Take a walk on the Wildeside of Merrion Square\\", The Sunday Times (Irish edition), 20 May 2001 Art historian Paula Murphy agreed, saying, \\"It has taken nearly one hundred years for an Irish body, public or private, to risk suggesting that we might consider Oscar Wilde worthy of such commemoration. But then it has taken the same length of time for Ireland to awaken, reluctantly, to the existence of sexuality and the reality of the way in which it dictates a lifestyle.\\"Murphy, Paula. \\"The Quare on the Square: a statue of Oscar Wilde for Dublin\\", in Jerusha McCormack (ed), 1998. Wilde the Irishman, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 127 It took as long for London, where Wilde spent most of his adult life, to commemorate the dramatist: Maggi Hambling's A Conversation with Oscar Wilde was unveiled in 1998. Discussing the work in her 2012 article \\"Sculpting Irishness: a discussion of Dublin's commemorative statues of Oscar Wilde and Phil Lynott\\" for Sculpture Journal, Sarah Smith writes: > Another distinction is the figure's facial expression, which, disrupting the > realism of the figure, might be described as a rather contorted sneer. > Intended by the artist to represent two antithetical sides of Wilde, one > half of his face is smiling widely ... while the other bears a sombre > expression ... and this divide is echoed in his posture on either side. > Because of its positioning at the corner of the park on the turn of the > outer pathway, the visitor to the monument sees one side of Wilde when > approaching and another when walking away. One is the witty Wilde who is > most often remembered in popular culture, the other the \\"broken man\\" he > became following his two-year incarceration for committing homosexual acts.

From an early stage, it operated under the protection, though not the ownership, of the child Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me, (1775-1844), a nephew of the reigning Louis XVI of France. This permitted it to operate despite the monopoly on coloured and gilded porcelain the king had given his own S√®vres porcelain. The Duke's name was dropped during the French Revolution. The wares were of very high quality, in styles similar to S√®vres, following the movement of fashion from Neoclassicism to the Empire style.BM The Empress Jos√©phine commissioned a service in 1811, with Dutch Golden Age paintings of genre subjects, in gilded Neoclassical settings, a somewhat surprising combination already used by S√®vres before the Revolution.Spieth, Darius A., Revolutionary Paris and the Market for Netherlandish Art, p. 421 A particular speciality was vases which imitated polished stone or tortoiseshell in porcelain, some in the slim fuseau shape and mounted with ormolu.\\"Pair of Porcelain and Ormolu Urns By Dihl & Gu√©rhard\\", Thomas Coulborn & Sons An abbreviated version of the formal name \\"Manufacture de Monsieur Le Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me\\" was sometimes stamped underneath pieces, and a mark of G and A intertwined was used.Piece in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, \\"MANUFRE/De MGR. le Duc/d'angouleme/a Paris\\" The factory's original location was rue de Bondy, Paris, but it moved to rue du Temple in 1789.BM File:Bricka.

It is native to several islands in the Bismarck Archipelago to the east of New Guinea. Like all paradise kingfishers, this bird has colourful plumage with a red bill and long distinctive tail streamers. Taxonomy The first formal description of the black-capped paradise kingfisher was by the English lawyer and zoologist Philip Sclater in 1877. He coined the current binomial name Tanysiptera nigriceps. The genus Tanysiptera had been introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825. The name Tanysiptera is from classical Greek tanusipteros meaning \\"long-feathered\\". The specific epithet nigriceps is from the Latin niger for \\"black\\" and -ceps for \\"head\\". The black- capped paradise kingfisher has sometimes been considered as a subspecies as the buff-breasted paradise kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia).

He had a twin brother named Boeotus.  Mythology  Arne confessed to her father that she was with child by the god Poseidon; her father, however, did not believe her, and handed her over to a man named Metapontus, King of Icaria. When B≈ìotus and Aeolus were born, they were raised by Metapontus; but their stepmother Autolyte (wife of Metapontus) quarrelled with their mother Arne, prompting B≈ìotus and Aeolus to kill Autolyte and flee from Icaria. B≈ìotus, accompanied by Arne, went to southern Thessaly, and founded Boeotia; but Aeolus went to a group of islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, which received from him the name of the Aeolian Islands. According to some accounts this Aeolus founded the town of Lipara. Although his home has been traditionally identified as one of the Aeolian Islands (there is little consensus as to which), near Sicily, an alternative location has been suggested at Gramvousa off the northwest coast of Crete. Aeolus had six sons and six daughters, whom in Homer he wed to one another and the family lived happily together. Later writers were shocked by the incest: in Hyginus,Hyginus, Fabulae 238 & 242 the day Aeolus learned that one of his sons, Macareus, had committed incest with his sister Canace he expelled Macareus and threw the child born of this incestuous union to the dogs,Ovid, Heroides 11 and sent his daughter a sword by which she was to kill herself.Plutarch, Parallela minora 28 Other late accounts claim that Macareus had a daughter named Amphissa, beloved by Apollo.

It is organised crime.\\" Anti-Bolshevik propaganda was created in opposition to the events on the Russian political scene. The Bolsheviks were members of a wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party which came to power during the October Revolution phase of the Russian Revolution in 1917. The word \\"Bolshevik\\" (–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≤–∏–∫) means \\"one of the majority\\" in Russian and is derived from the word \\"–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ\\" (transliteration: bol'shinstvo, see also Romanization of Russian) which means \\"majority\\" in English. The group was founded at the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party when Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs followers gained majority on the party‚Äôs central committee and on the editorial board of the newspaper Iskra. Their opponents were the Mensheviks, whose name literally means \\"Those of the minority\\" and is derived from the word –º–µ–Ω—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ (\\"men'shinstvo\\", English: minority). On 7 November 1917, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR or RSFSR; Russian: –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞, transliteration: Rossiyskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika) was proclaimed. The Bolsheviks changed their name to Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1918; to All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in December 1925; and to Communist Party of the Soviet Union in October 1952.  Anti-Bolshevik propaganda in Poland  Polish Anti-Bolshevik propaganda was most actively circulated during the Polish ‚Äì Soviet War. In 1918, Poland regained its statehood for the first time since 1795, the year of the Third Partition of Poland between Prussia, Russia and Austria. The new Polish territory included lands from all the dismembered empires (see Second Polish Republic). The first independent ruler of Poland since the end of the 18th century, the Chief-of-State, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic was J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. The war started as a conflict over Polish Borderlands. The Soviets circulated their own propaganda materials among Polish soldiers and civilians, urging them to join the fight for the liberation of working people and against their oppressors and bourgeoisie. Letters and appeals portrayed Soviet Russia as a worker utopia, where the worker has the highest power in the country. There were also active pro-Bolshevik movements in Poland. The main actor was the Communist Party of Poland, which was founded in December 1918 and was opposed to the war with the Bolsheviks. The Communist Party of Poland organized soldiers' councils (so called soviets) and engaged into circulating anti-Polish propaganda. = Propaganda posters = In the beginning of the 20th century posters were a popular form of communication. Posters were relatively efficient as they conveyed the message in a shortened form and could easily reach a big part of the population. Posters were hung on walls, trees, in store windows, and displayed during demonstrations. Organizations that were responsible for the design and circulation of posters were Komitet Obrony Kres√≥w Wschodnich (English: Committee for Protection of the Eastern Borderlands) and Stra≈º Kresowa (English: Borderlands Guard). Other organs were Propaganda Bureau in the Presidium of the Council of Ministers (Polish: Biuro Propagandy Wewnƒôtrznej przy prezydium Rady Ministr√≥w), Section of Civil Propaganda of the Committee for State Protection (Polish: Sekcja Propagandy Obywatelskiego Komitetu Obrony Pa≈Ñstwa and the Central Committee of Propaganda (Polish: Centralny Komitet Propagandy), run by artists. For the purpose of the anti-Bolshevik propaganda during the war Polish artists created posters. Some of the authors were Felicjan Kowarski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Skoczylas, Edmund Bart≈Çomiejczyk, Kajetan Stefanowicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarocki, Zygmunt Kami≈Ñski, Edmund John, Kamil Mackiewicz, Stanis≈Çaw Stawiczewski, Witold Gordon and Aleksander Grzybowski. Some of the posters are anonymous. The biggest number of posters, designed by Felicjan Szczƒôsny-Kowarski, Witold Gordon and Edmund John, were published by ‚ÄûLitografia Artystyczna W≈Çadys≈Çaw G√≥rczewski.‚Äù Others publishers include private printing houses, such as ‚ÄûZak≈Çad Graficzny Boles≈Çaw Wirtz‚Äù, ‚ÄûZak≈Çad Graficzny Straszewicz√≥w‚Äù, ‚ÄûZak≈Çad Graficzny B.Wierzbicki i S-ka‚Äù, ‚ÄûZak≈Çady Graficzne Kozia≈Ñskich‚Äù and ‚ÄûJan Cotty‚Äù. The poster reads \\"Beat the Bolshevik!\\" (Polish: \\"Bij Bolszewika\\")  Style  In contrast to the avant-garde Soviet posters, Polish posters are characterized by references to Romanticism, Impressionism, Symbolism, realistic historical painting and Young Poland. They commonly use caricature.  Topics  * Antisemitism. During the Polish-Soviet War, some people believed that Jews were responsible for the October Revolution, or even that the Bolshevik movement was an effect of a Jewish conspiracy theory. This led to the formation of the stereotype of the Jew-Communist, belonging to what was pejoratively called ≈ªydokomuna (English: Judeo-Communism; see also Jewish Bolshevism). * Vision of Poland under the Soviet rule. Poland under the Soviet was portrayed as a dystopia: it was characterized by destruction, fire, poverty and hunger. * Religion. The authors have referred to religious beliefs of Poles, which were largely Catholic. The Bolsheviks were thus presented as the enemy of the Catholic Church. The poster \\"Do broni! Tak wyglƒÖda wie≈õ zajƒôta przez bolszewik√≥w\\" (English: To the Arms! This is what a village conquered by the Bolsheviks look like!\\") by Eugeniusz Nieczuja-Urba≈Ñski presents a destroyed village, where the only remaining and intact part of the demolished church is a cross with Jesus Christ. Another one, \\"Kto w Boga wierzy ‚Äì w Obronie Ostrobramskiej, pod sztandar Or≈Ça i Pogoni\\" (\\"Whoever believes in God, should protect Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn, under the Flag of the Eagle and Pahonia.\\") urges religious Poles to protect their homeland. It is also suggested that due to the monstrosity of the Bolsheviks, one has to entrust their fate to the Providence in order to successfully fight the enemy. The conflict is presented as a fight between Christians and non-Christians, or anti-Christians. * Animalization, dehumanization and demonization of the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik soldier is portrayed as a barbarian, an uncivilized, wild, primivite person. Their faces are portrayed caricaturally, with unproportioned features. The Bolsheviks are pictured as cruel and demonic or monster-like creatured. The color red is dominating in the pictures, as it was associated with communism. The enemies are often surrounded by blood: dripping from a knife (for example held in teeth), on hands or standing in a river of blood. \\"Hej, kto Polak, na bagnety!\\"\\"Nam twierdzƒÖ bƒôdzie ka≈ºdy pr√≥g.\\" English: Every doorsill shall be a fortress.  Notable examples  thumbA poster depicting Lev Trotsky. Small caption in the lower right corner reads: The Bolsheviks promised: We'll give you peace We'll give you freedom We'll give you land Work and bread Despicably they cheated They started a war With Poland Instead of freedom they brought The fist Instead of land -confiscation Instead of work ‚Äì misery Instead of bread ‚Äì famine. * The poster \\"Hej, kto Polak, na bagnety!\\" (English: \\"Hey, whoever is a Pole, to your bayonette!\\"). The quote originates from the Polish patriotic poem and celebratory anthem \\"Rota\\" written by the poet and an activist for Polish independence Maria Konopnicka. The poster features three men, seemingly belonging to different social groups, but uniting in fight. * The poster \\"Bij Bolszewika\\" (English: \\"Beat the Bolshevik!\\") portraying a Polish soldier fighting a red, three-headed dragon symbolizing the enemy. * The poster \\"Do broni. Wstƒôpujcie do Armji Ochotniczej!\\" (English: \\"To the arms! Join the volunteer army!\\"), where the Bolshevik enemy is portrayed as three-headed dragon, breathing fire. Fighting the hydra is a Polish soldier. * The poster \\"Potw√≥r Bolszewicki\\" (English: \\"The Bolshevik Monster\\"), where the enemy is presented a skeleton riding a two-headed horse with heads of Vladimir Lenin and Lev Trotsky.  Contemporary usage  Currently, 41 anti-Bolshevik posters are displayed in the Museum of Independence in Warsaw.  Anti-Bolshevik propaganda in Nazi Germany  An example of a German Anti-Bolshevik poster. The poster reads \\"Down with the Bolshevism! The Bolshevism brings war, doom, hunger and death.\\" (German: \\"Nieder mit dem Bolshewismus. Bolshewismus bringt Krieg und Verderben, Hunger und Tod\\" ) The Anti-Bolshevik and Anti-Communist propaganda in Germany was created and circulated by the Anti-Bolshevik League (German: Antibolschewistische Liga), later renamed to the League for Protection of German Culture (German: Liga zum Schutze der deutschen Kultur). The Anti- Bolshevik League was a radical right-wing organization, founded in December 1918 by Eduard Stadtler.  Anti-Bolshevik propaganda in Russia  = Postcards = Anti-Bolshevik postcards were circulated by the Volunteer Army (Russian: –î–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∞—Ä–º–∏—è; transliteration: Dobrovolcheskaya armiya). The White Volunteer Army was an army in South Russia during the Russian Civil War that fought the Bolsheviks. It has to be noted that the Propaganda Bureau of the Volunteer Army produced less postcards than the Bolshevik government. According to the researcher Tobie Mathew, the anti-Bolshevik cards are amongst the scarcest of all Russian postcards for two reasons: firstly, they were politically incorrect in the Soviet Union and, secondly, only a small number of cards was issued to begin with. It has to be noted that the Bolsheviks, were far more successful in printing their propaganda materials, as control over printed media was considered a high priority by Lenin. After 1917, the Bolsheviks took over many previously privately owned printing houses across Russia. Postcards and posters were generally preferred as a part of the Russian population was illiterate, which made books and pamphlets less effective. The main publishers of the Bolshevik propaganda were Litizdat and Gosizdat (Russian: –ì–æ—Å–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç; English: State Publisher). Since many Russians with Anti-Bolshevik sympathies had fled the country or were attempting to, and the White Army was constantly changing its location, most of the postcards were printed in the northern and south-western borderlands of the former Russian Empire, particularly in Finland and the Baltic States, and under the pro-German government in Ukraine in 1918. For security reasons, the postcards were usually transported by trains and distributed by hand.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433732 on 2017-05-19 Description The length of the shell varies between 3 mm and 10.4 mm. (Original description) The shell has an irregularly biconic shap, resembling Eucithara decussata (Pease, 1868). and Eucithara delacouriana (Crosse, 1869) in shape. The shell is thick and solid. Its color is whitish, indistinctly marked with about 4 yellowish spots on the front slope of each rib, and corresponding brown spots on the lip-varix, and with a band composed of 4 to 6 purple-brow lines below the suture. The sculpture shows longitudinal rounded ribs parted by wider concave intervals, and 10 or 11 in number on the body whorl. The last rib is much larger and forms the lip-varix. About 30 spiral threads, on the body whorl, cross the ribs and intervals, sometimes with minor threads between them. The spaces between these threads are evenly granulose by the decussation of growth lines and spiral striae, there being about four spiral series of granides in each interval. The shell contains 7¬Ω whorls. The 2¬Ω whorls in the protoconch are smooth and rounded, the rest subangular in the middle. The body whorl is shouldered above, the shoulder rounded. The aperture is narrow. The outer lip is nearly straight, with about 8 white teeth within. The columella is white, with four or five small entering folds, increased to 8 or 10 at the margin, and with several on the parietal wall.Pilsbry, Henry A., Sc.D.

Later classical writers regarded him as a god.  Family  Juno asking Aeolus to release the winds, by leftAeolus by Alexandre Jacovleff shows Aeolus as an embodiment of Wind himself.Aeolus was the son of Hippotes, son of Mimas, a son of Aeolus, son of Hellen. He was most frequently conflated with Aeolus, the son of Poseidon, god of the sea. According to some accounts, Hippotes married the same Melanippe who was the mother of Arne.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.67.3 (trans. Oldfather) Like Aeolus, the son of Poseidon, this Aeolus was said to have had twelve children - six sons and six daughters. According to Diodorus, he was father of six sons by Cyane, daughter of Liparus (the eponym of the island Lipara, whom Aeolus assisted in conquering lands above Surrentum, Italy). The sons' names were Agathyrnus, Astyochus, Androcles, Iocastus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, whereas the daughters are not mentioned at all. The sons were said to have become kings: Iocastus of the region in southern Italy as far as Rhegium; Pheraemon and Androcles of the part of Sicily between the Strait of Messina and Lilybaeum; Xuthus of Leontini; Agathyrnus of what was known as Agathyrnitis, having founded Agathyrnum; and Astyochus of Lipara. All were said to have been remembered as just and pious rulers.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.7.6 & 4.8.3 Another list of Aeolus' children is found in scholia on the Odyssey. The latter source gives the sons' names as Androcles, Chrysippus, Iocastus, Phalacrus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, and the daughters' as Aeole, Astycrateia, Dia, Hephaestia, Iphthe, Periboea; their mother in this account is Telepora or Telepatra, daughter of Laestrygon.Scholia on Homer, Odyssey 10.6 Parthenius of NicaeaParthenius, Erotica Pathemata 2 recorded a love affair between Odysseus and Aeolus' daughter Polymele; the latter was said to have ended up betrothed to her own brother Diores.  Mythology  Juno by Lucio Massari This Aeolus lived on the floating island of Aeolia and was visited by Odysseus and his crew in the Odyssey. After their misadventure in Polyphemus' cave, Aeolus gave them hospitality for a month and provided them a west wind to carry them home to Ithaca. He also provided a gift of an ox-hide bag containing all winds but the west. Odysseus and his crew members traveled steadily and anxiously for several days, but with his native land in sight, Odysseus sank overpowered by sleep. His men proceeded to indulge their curiosity to see the costly presents which they thought the bag contained, opened it unwittingly, and out burst the imprisoned winds with such a roar that the force drove the ship back to Aeolus' island. Aeolus refused to provide any further help,Homer, Odyssey 10.2 because he believed that their short and unsuccessful voyage meant that the gods did not favour them. This Aeolus was perceived by post-Homeric authors as a god, rather than as a mortal and simple Keeper of the Winds (as in the Odyssey). In the Aeneid by Virgil, Juno offers Aeolus the nymph Deiopea as a wife if he will release his winds upon the fleet of Aeneas,Virgil, Aeneid 1.71-75 but Poseidon later calms the sea.

He spent a semester at City College of New York studying linguistics; he speaks French, Italian, English and Yiddish. He then transferred to Harvard University, where he studied art history and philosophy, graduating in 1966.Financial Times interview, Retrieved May 19, 2017 He then moved to Paris where he worked as a screenwriter, then as a needle-stitcher, opening a small shop. He experimented with unusually colored yarn. Its clientele included designers from Herm√®s and Valentino. Rosenthal one day was asked if he could design a mount for a gemstone. That sent his career in a new direction. Career After a short stint as a salesman in the New York store of Bulgari, he returned to Paris in 1977 and began designing pieces there from affordable materials, such as coral, moonstone and minute colored diamond. Quick success led the self-taught Rosenthal to open a non-descript salon at 7 Place Vend√¥me, where he still hosts his loyal clients.Most influential jewelry designers Retrieved May 19, 2017 His company, JAR, has no shop window or sign on the street.

This protein represents a large fungal family of transcription factors, Gal4 family, which includes over 50 members in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae e.g. Oaf1, Pip2, Pdr1, Pdr3, Leu3. Gal4 recognizes genes with UAS, an upstream activating sequence, and activates them. In yeast cells, the principal targets are GAL1 (galactokinase), GAL10 (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), and GAL7 (galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase), three enzymes required for galactose metabolism. This binding has also proven useful in constructing the GAL4/UAS system, a technique for controlling expression in insects. In yeast, Gal4 is by default repressed by Gal80, and activated in the presence of galactose as Gal3 binds away Gal80. Domains Two executive domains, DNA binding and activation domains, provide key function of the Gal4 protein conforming to most of the transcription factors. Gal4 domains and regulation =DNA binding= Gal4 N-terminus is a zinc finger of the belongs to the Zn(2)-C6 fungal family. It forms a Zn ‚Äì cysteines thiolate cluster, and specifically recognizes UAS in GAL1 promoter. =Gal4 transactivation= Localised to the C-terminus, belongs to the nine amino acids transactivation domain family, 9aaTAD, together with Oaf1, Pip2, Pdr1, Pdr3, but also p53, E2A, MLL. Regulation Galactose induces Gal4 mediated transcription albeit Glucose causes severe repression. As a part of the Gal4 regulation, inhibitory protein Gal80 recognises and binds to the Gal4 region (853-874 aa). The inhibitory protein Gal80 is sequestered by regulatory protein Gal3 in Galactose dependent manner. This allows for Gal4 to work when there is galactose. =Mutants= The Gal4 loss-of-function mutant gal4-64 (1-852 aa, deletion of the Gal4 C-terminal 29 aa) lost both interaction with Gal80 and activation function. In the Gal4 reverted mutant Gal4C-62 mutant, a sequence (QTAY N AFMN) with the 9aaTAD pattern emerged and restored activation function of the Gal4 protein. =Inactive constructs= The activation domain Gal4 is inhibited by C-terminal domain in some Gal4 constructs.  Function  =Target= =Transcription= The Gal4 activation function is mediated by MED15 (Gal11). The Gal4 protein interacts also with other mediators of transcription as are Tra1, TAF9, and SAGA/MED15 complex. (http://mcb.asm.org/content/25/1/114/F8.large.jpg) =Proteosome= A subunit of the 26 S proteasome Sug2 regulatory protein has a molecular and functional interaction with Gal4 function. Proteolytic turnover of the Gal4 transcription factor is not required for function in vivo. The native Gal4 monoubiquitination protects from 19S-mediated destabilizing under inducing conditions. Application The broad use of the Gal4 is in yeast two-hybrid screening to screen or to assay protein-protein interactions in eukaryotic cells from yeast to human. In the GAL4/UAS system, the Gal4 protein and Gal4 upstream activating region (UAS) are used to study the gene expression and function in organisms such as the fruit fly. The Gal4 and inhibitory protein Gal80 have found application in a genetics technique for creating individually labeled homozygous cells called MARCM (Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker).

History =Beginning= Achim Jaspert and Andy Cay formed the Split Mirrors in 1985 during a meeting in a rehearsal space in M√ºnster. Jaspert brought in drums experiences, which he acquired during his stay in India, while Cay already was a singer in the United States. Peter Delain completed the band as a keyboardist. They wrote their first songs and recorded the following EPs: ‚ÄúThe Right Time‚Äù (Extended Version) and ‚ÄúVoices‚Äù (Extended Version). After debuting their single ‚ÄùThe right time‚Äù (Let's go crazy mix) they had gigs at home and abroad. In 1993 the album ‚Äû1999‚Äú was released. = Studio and technical equipment = They started their own recording studio to be able to work whenever they want to. A sound-proof room allowed recordings of analogue sources like vocals or saxophone. The synthesizers which were available at that time, already had a Midi connection and were connected to computers from the Atari-ST series who had Midi connectors as well. This allowed them to record melodies digitally and edit them afterwards. SMPTE made it possible to connect vocals or other analogue recordings with midi instruments and therefore they could edit and program the digital parts. The Atari Falcon had a DSP chip and offered Hard Disk Recording. Through that it was possible to edit analogue sounds as well. The revolution of the digital recording techniques made it possible for them to use the same techniques at their studio that you normally only find in professional studios. = Collaboration with M√ºnsterians = Many artists from the scene in M√ºnster played and recorded their music there, like WestBam, Frank Mertens from Alphaville, Dr. Ring-Ding, T√∂rner Stier, Bawa Abudu, Ulrich Hesselkamp, Doc Heyne and Simon Cay. There were musicians from many different genres like Rock, Reggae, Synthie Pop, German Schlager, Hip-Hop, Rap or Rave. Some of them even participated in songs by Split Mirrors. = Work for others = Collaborating with other artists became one of their main jobs. They composed, wrote songs or produced songs for artists like Marani, Mike Bauhaus, Andreas Martin and Wolfgang Petry. Those artists sold more than 5 million records and received several gold and platinum awards. They produced songs for the German rock band Audiosmog with former VIVA presenter Tobias Schlegel as guest vocalist. In 2001 they recorded a cover version of ‚ÄúDaylight in Your Eyes‚Äù which is originally performed by No Angels. This song went up to number 36 in the Media-Control-Charts. After that, they followed up with the single ‚ÄúWhen Will I Be Famous (Originally Performed by Bros)‚Äù and the album ‚ÄúTop of Rocks‚Äù which featured cover versions of famous hits. = Remixing their own songs = They began doing a series of remixes from some of their older songs. The new versions were released as EPs, e.g. ‚Äú1999 Freestyle‚Äù and ‚ÄúVoices Freestyle‚Äù. Together new band member Henry Flex on keyboards they recorded an album called ‚ÄúIn London‚Äù in early 2007, from which they coupled out the EP ‚ÄúSplit Mirrors Freestyle‚Äù. In January 2011, they released the album ‚ÄúFrom the Beginning‚Äù. On this Album there are mostly previously unreleased songs from the beginning years in the style of those years. There are also some new songs on the album on which the Chinese singer Fan Jiang participated. =Modern remixes= Through the implementation of elements from Electro- and Deep house they remixed in collaboration with international DJs from the 1980s synthypop titles like ‚ÄûThe Right Time‚Äú and ‚ÄûVoices‚Äú. Other artists as well wanted the titles in this fresh style like DJ Adam van Hammer and singer Kitsu with the songs ‚ÄúLike Ice in the Sunshine‚Äù and ‚ÄúDolce Vita‚Äù. Further the band Bad Boys Blue with ‚ÄúYou're a Woman‚Äù and singer Fancy with ‚ÄúSlice Me Nice‚Äù. In December 2016 DJ Adamski, Henry Flex and Achim Jaspert released Dr. Rave ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Time to Rave ‚Äì Again‚Äù. It was the official hymn for the event ‚Äú90s Rave Berlin‚Äù which was held on 11 March 2017.

He is a celebrated hero of many Jain and Buddhist religious scriptures. Ancient Buddhist text of Kumbhakara Jataka mentions him to be the Pratyekabuddha or the enlightened living being. Karakandu was a great devotee of the 23rd Jain tirthankar Parshvanatha who preached Jainism in Kalinga around 850 B.C. Karakandu is also referred to as the \\"Bull among Kings\\" by Mahavira, the 24th Jain tithankar. Successive Jain chroniclers over the years have placed him in the group of four Chakravati kings of the Indian subcontinent during his time who also were considered as prateykabudhhas namely, Nagnajit of Gandhara, Nemi or Nimi of Videha, Durmukha or Dwimukha of Panchala and Karakandu of Kalinga. After achieving victory over many kings and ruling for a long term, Karakandu became a Jain Sramana and left the throne and kingdom in charge of his son. During his time Kalinga was a Jain stronghold often described as the Kalinga Jinasana which may be compared to the later era Buddhist Janapadas. It was Jain monk Kanakmara's work in Apabrhamasa or Prakrit language known as Karakandu Cariu which gives detailed events about his life.  Successive Buddhist and Jain ancient literature describing Karakandu  Both the followers of Buddhism and Jainism have written successive literature about Karakandu till the early 16th Century A.D. The languages like Prakrit. Pali and Sanskrit were used to create the literal works about him. The literature works about his life are, * Karakanda Cariu by Jain monk Kanakmara (Digambara Jain sect) * Majjimanikaya (Buddhist) * Kumbhakara Jataka (Buddhist) * Uttaradhyayana Sutra by Devendra (Swetambara Jain sect) * Sisyahita commentary by Santisuri (Swetambara Jain sect) * Kathakosa by Subhasilagani (Swetambara Jain sect) * Apabhramsa or Prakrit Language story of Karakandu by Sricandra (Digambara Jain sect) * Karakanda Caritra by Subhacandra and Sakalbhusana (Digambara Jain sect) * Karakanda Caritra by Rayadhu in Prakrit Language * Punyasravana Kathakosa by Ramacandra in Sanskrit Language  Life of Karakandu as narrated in literature  Jain Monk Kanakmara's creation \\"Karakanda Cariu\\" is the most complete work on the life of Karakandu. Karakandu is depicted as a brave and heroic king who has championed different subjects and skills. He is mentioned in the poems as \\"Pinnasiya-ariyana-jivayena\\" meaning destroyer of the lives of the foes and \\"Aridusaha-modana-modusahau\\" meaning vanquisher of the irresistible enemies by twisting their bodies in frontal battles. He made his sceptre, royal umbrella and elephant goad from the wild bamboo sticks that grew out of the eye sockets of dead man's skull lying in his crematorium on the advise of Jain sramanas Yasobhadra and Virabhadra, after sitting on the throne of Kalinga. Though there are mythical angles induced in this work of literature, the historicity of the character is substantiated by multiple follow up works by believers from both Buddhism and Jainism. = Early Life of Karakandu = Karakandu was the son of king Dadhivahana and Queen Padmavati of Anga kingdom. As recorded in the literature, Padmavati wished to ride an elephant with her husband while being Pregnant with Karakandu. Due to some reasons the elephant became agitated and ran into the forests uncontrollably. The king saved himself while the queen became unconscious and later found herself in a deserted and dry cremation ground. The queen was first rescued by a Brhamin but his wife later expelled her from the house being jealous of her beauty. The queen took refuge in the crematorium and gave birth to Karakandu with a dry scab in his hand. Matanga Baladeva, a Vidyadhara or wisdom holder from a state by the Vijayardha close to Kalinga persuaded the queen that the child is destined to become the king of Kalinga one day and should be left with him to be trained for this purpose. Due to the scab wound in the baby's hand Baladeva named him Karakanda. In other interpretation about this name it is said that the scab in his hand would itch always for which he need the help of his friends hence coming to be known as Karakandu. He learned all the arts and sciences to gain knowledge under the guidance of the Matanga Baladeva. Brhamins used to call him Avakinnayo which meant low born outcast since his birth who dwelled at the crematorium. Queen Padmavati left the place and went on to become a nun under the sage Samadhigupta. After some years the king of Kalinga by the name Dantavakra died without any heir to the throne. Undergoing some ritual tests, Karakandu was chosen as the king. He married the princess Madanavali, the daughter of the king of Girinagara known as Ajayvarma. = Seize on Champa = According to the narration in the literature, the king Dadhivahana of Champa city (capital of Anga) or the real father of Karakandu demanded him to pay homages being unaware that he was his son. Karakandu enraged with this act led a seize on Champa by crossing the river Ganga. Mythical angles used in the narration of the texts exaggerate the scene of the battle between both father and son. Karakandu was almost defeated in the battle but due to the use of knowledge provided to him by the Vindyadhara and his foster father Matanga Baladeva, he was able to turn the tide of the battle. According to the narrations it is said that the mother of Karakandu who had by now turned a nun intervened in some manner and introduced both father and son to each other. Realizing that Karakandu was his son, Dadhivahana crowned him as the king of Champa. = Military Expedition on Southern India = After becoming the king, Karakandu sent out emissaries expecting homages and taxes to him from the Chola, Chera and Pandyan kings in the south. The southern kings denied to comply. Karakandu marched with a huge army to subjugate the southern kings as they didn't accept his suzerainty. He camped at Terapura or Dharashiv in the modern Osmanabad district of Maharastra. Here the king of the Asmaka region by the name Shiva welcomed him to his territory by paying him a visit and Karakandu learned about the spiritual importance of the place and the mountains as a Jain shrine. Following some folklore of the time he excavated the Dharashiv caves and also build some new caves there for meditation by Jain monks. Karakandu landed on Simhala island with his army and the king accepting his suzerainty invited him to his palace and married off his daughter, the princess Rativega to him. Marriages of Karakandu The narrations also say that while returning from his expedition in south with the princess of Lanka, he protected a Vidyadhara by killing his enemies and then married his daughter Kanakprabha. He is also said to have married other women from the Vidyadhara community like Anangalekha, Chandralekha, Kusumavah along with seven hundred women. Karakandu invaded the territories of the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas and defeated them. The rulers of these dynasties were taken prisoners and presented before him. Soon he realized that the kings were devotees of the Jain tirthankars as the kings had their carved idols or symbols in their crowns. He forgives them and lets them to independently rule as his vassals in the south.  Karakandu becomes a Jain Sramana  Karakandu was counseled by the sage Silagupta at his second capital Champa about the truth of material life and the religious principles. Disgusted with the way life functions in the material premises, he abdicated his throne for his son Vasupala and left the kingdom to become a monk. The mother of Karakandu, Padmavati is also described to have attained heaven during this phase of counseling by Silagupta.Parshvanath in Dharashiv caves According to Kanakmara, Karakanda had very strong faith in the teachings by greatest Jain philosophers of his era. He strictly followed the Anuvratas and Gunavratas principles of Jainism, which are applicable for both monks and household people according to Jainism. Since most of the literary works about Karakandu are written with mythical and magical angles to the realistic events of his time, the historicity behind his existence is proven due to the repeated efforts to keep him alive through literature by both Buddhists and Jains along with the present existence of Dharashiv caves in Maharashtra which he had excavated and renovated once in his lifetime.

In 1835 he improved the mandolin, creating a version of the instrument that used steel wires for strings, known today as the \\"Neapolitan Mandolin.\\" His use of steel strings has become the dominant way of stringing mandolins. Developing the mandolin The first evidence of modern metal-string mandolins is from literature regarding popular Italian players who travelled through Europe teaching and giving concerts. Notable are Gabriele Leone, Giovanni Battista Gervasio, Pietro Denis, who travelled widely between 1750 and 1810.The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and others (2001) This, with the records gleaned from the Italian Vinaccia family of luthiers in Naples, Italy, led some musicologists to believe that the modern steel-string mandolins were developed in Naples by the Vinaccia family. Pasquale was born into this musical instrument making family and was the son of Gaetano Vinaccia. Not limited to mandolins, the Vinaccias made stringed instruments, including violins, cellos, guitars, mandolas and mandolins. Noted members of the family who made mandolins are known today from labels inside of surviving instruments and include Vincenzo, Giovanni, Domenico, and Antonio (and his sons Gaetano and Gennaro, grandson Pasquale and great-grandsons Gennaro and Achille). The mandolins they made changed over generations, from s with flat soundboards and gut-strings, through mandolins with a bent soundboard and bronze or bronze-and-gut strings, into mandolins with bent soundboards that used steel or steel-and-bronze strings. Pasquale modernized the mandolin by raising and extending the fingerboard to 17 frets and introducing the stronger wire strings made of high-tension steel. He substituted a machine head for the friction tuning pegs that were standard in the early 19th Century. The new wire strings required that he strengthen the mandolin's body, and he deepened the mandolin's bowl, giving the tonal quality more resonance. His own sons, Gennaro and Achille, were also luthiers. Instruments were made into the 1880s bearing the label Pasquale Vinaccia and sons. He had two daughters Teresa and Rosa. Rosa was the mother of mandolinist virtuoso Carlo Munier. Elder family and cousins There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier. His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia (c.1710-c.1788) (active c. 1755-c. 1778) and Nic. Vinaccia. His son Antonio Vinaccia (1734-1796) was active c. 1756 to c. 1784. An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759, which resides at the University of Edinburgh. Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia, built in 1893, is also at the University of Edinburgh. The earliest extant mandolin was built in 1744 by Antonio's son, Gaetano Vinaccia. It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels, Belgium.
