It was based on the Brahmi-based scripts of both north and south India. The best available evidence suggests that the Pyu script gradually developed between the 2nd and 6th centuries CE. The Pyu script's immediate precursor appears to be the Kadamba script of southwest India. The early period Pyu inscriptions always included interlinear Brahmi scripts.

The Oriental Railway Company's Alsancak-Aydƒ±n Main Line crossed with the Smyrna Cassaba Railway's Basmane-Afyon Main Line. Due to the layout of the tracks, the station was first named Istravoz railway station in 1866. Istravoz (from Greek œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅ√≥œÇ) means Cross in Turkish. After the Republic of Turkey was formed in 1923, the station's name was changed to Hilal which means 'crescent', due to the majority of the city's population being Muslim. The Hilal metro station, which opened in 2000, is located adjacent to the railway station. When the electrification of the tracks around ƒ∞zmir started in 2001, the station was closed. Hilal station served the Hilal neighbourhood east of Basmane. Since early 2011 there had been talk of reopening Hilal as a second transfer point between ƒ∞ZBAN and ƒ∞zmir Metro. On 4 August 2013, the station reopened serving IZBAN commuter trains. Two new island platforms were built and the station now lies on the Izmir-Eƒüirdir railway instead of the Izmir-Afyon railway.

The account records their sudden deaths after lying to the Holy Spirit about money. Their story is rarely shown in art, but is the subject of one of the Raphael Cartoons, and a panel on the Brescia Casket, both illustrated here. It is also shown on a 1590s painting by Ambrosius Francken the Elder. Christian-Anarchists see this story as evidence that the apostolic Church relied on a form of proto- communism. Story summary Ananias and Sapphira on the Brescia Casket, late 4th century (middle register, centre and right) Acts chapter closes by stating that the first followers of Jesus did not consider their possessions to be their own but rather held in common, in order to use what they had on behalf of those in want. For example, Barnabas, a Levite from Cyprus, sold a plot of land and donated the proceeds to the apostles. As told at the beginning of Acts chapter Ananias and Sapphira, following Barnabas' example, also sold their land but secretly withheld a portion of the proceeds. Ananias presented his donation to Peter. Peter replied, \\"Why is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit?\\" Peter pointed out that Ananias was in control of the money and could give or keep it as he saw fit, but had withheld a portion of it. Peter stated that Ananias had lied not to men, but to God. Ananias died on the spot and was carried out. Everyone who heard about the incident feared the Lord. Three hours after Ananias' death his wife arrived, unaware of what had happened. Peter asked her the price of the land that she and Ananias had sold, and she stated the same untruthful price that Ananias had given. She also fell dead. Patristic commentary The fourth- century archbishop John Chrysostom alludes to and then dismisses the idea that Peter could be held responsible for the couple's death.Homily 12 on Acts of the Apostles, Homily 3 on Galatians. St John Chrysostom at CCEL. Retrieved 2018-04-13. Modern scholarship The morality of the incident has been the source of some commentary. Dunn (1996) describes it as \\"one of the most unnerving episodes in the whole of the New Testament.\\" Many scholars have noted parallels with the story of Achan (Joshua 7), and Havelaar (1997) notes various parallel events in pagan literature, in particular one close parallel in an event recounted by Herodotus about a certain Glaucus who tried to tempt the gods at Delphi by lying about money he had kept dishonestly, and was subsequently deprived of descendants.Rick Strelan, Strange acts: studies in the cultural world of the Acts of the Apostles, 2004, page 199. \\"Dunn thinks it is 'one of the most unnerving episodes in the whole of the New Testament' (1996: 62), ... The story parallels that of Achan (Josh. 7), as many scholars have noted, but also interesting are the parallels to which Henriette Havelaar (1997) draws attention. While many of the parallels she offers are not very close in details, there is a close parallel in Herodotus, who tells of a man who entrusted a large amount of money to a certain Glaucus.\\"Havelaar, H. 1997. \\"Hellenistic Parallels to Acts 5:1‚Äì11 and the Problem of Conflicting Interpretations\\". Journal for the Study of the New Testament 67: 63‚Äì82.Herodotus, . Translated by George Rawlinson, 1859. \\"As for Glaucus, he made a journey to Delphi, and there consulted the oracle. ‚Ä¶ the Pythoness replied that it was as bad to have tempted the god as it would have been to have done the deed.\\" Darrell Bock concludes that the episode emphasises the seriousness of sin, as well as the graciousness of God who often defers judgment. The church is not composed of perfect people, but sins including pride and deceit will eventually be dealt with.Darrell Bock, 2007. The Lutheran New Testament Professor Matthew L. Skinner claims the story is meant to be gallows humour. He states that, \\"The story aims for gallows humor, but we read Acts in a different place today. Our familiarity with religiously sanctioned violence makes it difficult to laugh, even if we understand that this scene may not be offered as serious, definitive theology.\\"Matthew L. Skinner, \\"On Why People do NOT Give Money to Their Church\\" . Trinity Lutheran Church, 6 October 2016. Marc Pernot, Calvinist pastor at L'Oratoire du Louvre, sees the story as a critique of the shortcomings of Peter and the early Church. \\"When men want to impose unity, there are problems. ‚Ä¶ Jesus never instituted a system requiring people to liquidate all their capital... This is compulsory morality... Luke, the author of the book of Acts thus presents Peter and his first church rather critically. In my opinion it is not the only time, because if Peter seems to be the leader of the Church of Jerusalem in the days of Ananias and Sapphira, later in the book of Acts (Acts 15 and Galatians 2:8) we see that he has lost the first place...\\"Marc Pernot, Il est parfois criminel de confondre son √©glise et le Saint-Esprit. L'Oratoire du Louvre, 28 August 2011. P. M. Garner reads the story as subversive narrative showing Peter, complicit in the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira, showing immaturity in imaging the son of God.Garner, Phillip Michael: (Eugene, Or: Wipf and Stock Publishing, 2017). According to the missionary and author Paris Reidhead, the passage is intended to illustrate two key points: the seriousness of lying to the Holy Spirit and the importance of keeping integrity in the believers‚Äô fellowship with Christ, i.e., keeping the fellowship free of sin. More specifically on the second point, Reidhead commented that the introduction of sin would destroy the unity that the early believers had in the Holy Spirit, and would thus remove God‚Äôs blessing on the body. Reidhead noted that God does not punish everyone who makes the same mistake as Ananias and Sapphira; nevertheless, the passage illustrates God‚Äôs unambiguous attitude on this matter. Though the passage is about the offering of money, Reidhead extended the implication to all services offered to God. There must not be any ulterior motives in an offering made to God, such as desiring material gain, fame, or praise of man for oneself. Concerning the belief held by some, that Peter caused the death of the couple, Reidhead held the view that Peter simply anticipated God‚Äôs action and relayed it to Ananias and Sapphira before God took the action.

Career Hubbard reached the final of the 2012 PDC World Youth Championship. He beat Michael van Gerwen in the final at the O2 Arena in London on 17 May 2012. As a result of reaching the final, he received a PDC Pro Tour card for 2012. Hubbard's title also earned him an invitation to the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts. He lost against Phil Taylor, Mervyn King and Steve Beaton in the group stage. In May 2012, Hubbard earned a place in the German Darts Championship by defeating Andrew Gilding and Kevin Dowling in the UK qualifier. In the first round of the event in Berlin he pulled off the best result of his career to date by knocking out reigning two-time world champion Adrian Lewis 6‚Äì4. He continued his run by defeating Peter Wright in round two, before losing to his practice partner Mervyn King 6‚Äì4 in the last 16. Hubbard also qualified for the third European Tour event, the European Darts Open in D√ºsseldorf. He beat Andy Hamilton in the first round, and Steve Brown in the second. After defeating Mark Walsh 6‚Äì3 in the last 16, a result which secured his qualification for the 2012 World Matchplay, Hubbard shed tears of joy on the stage. He then lost to Richie Burnett 6‚Äì2 in the quarter-finals. Hubbard played Wes Newton in the first round of the World Matchplay and was beaten 10‚Äì5. In October, he saw off Denis Ovens 6‚Äì2 in the opening round of the Dutch Darts Masters, before losing 6‚Äì4 to Andy Jenkins. Hubbard qualified for the Grand Slam of Darts again thanks to his 2011 World Youth Championship title, but lost all of three Group C games against Simon Whitlock, Dean Winstanley and Kevin Painter to finish bottom of the table. Hubbard qualified for the 2013 World Championship, his first, by finishing 34th on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, claiming the fourth of sixteen spots that were available to non-qualified players. He lost the opening six legs of his first round match against Richie Burnett to be two sets down, but with the crowd heavily favouring Hubbard, Burnett's form dropped substantially and Hubbard was able to level the match at 2‚Äì2. However, the Welshman's experience eventually told as he took the deciding set by four legs to two. Hubbard was ranked world number 52 after the event. He lost 5‚Äì3 to Andy Smith in the second round of the UK Open. He had a disappointing year overall as he could not win beyond the last 32 of any ranking tournament. Hubbard advanced to the third round of the UK Open for the second time of his career in 2014, but was thrashed 9‚Äì1 by world number one Michael van Gerwen. At the fifth Players Championship, Hubbard enjoyed notable 6‚Äì0 and 6‚Äì4 victories over Wes Newton and Van Gerwen in reaching his first semi-final on the PDC tour, which he lost 6‚Äì1 to Brendan Dolan. Hubbard won the eighth Youth Tour event of the year by beating Reece Robinson 4‚Äì2 in the final. Hubbard was ranked world number 74 at the start of 2015, meaning he had to enter Q School in order to win his place back on tour. However, he was unable to progress past the last 64 on any of the four days to fall short of earning a new tour card. Hubbard failed to qualify for the UK Open, but played in all 32 of the Challenge and Development Tour tournaments, reaching one quarter-final in the final Development Tour event where he was knocked out 4‚Äì3 by Josh Payne. The only European Tour event he reached was the European Darts Trophy, where he lost 6‚Äì1 to Rowby-John Rodriguez in the first round. In 2016, Hubbard played in all 19 of the Development Tour events, recording two quarter-final and two semi-final finishes. He qualified for the European Darts Grand Prix, but could only average 75.22 during a 6‚Äì2 first round loss to Max Hopp. Practice Hubbard practices and travels with the 2004 World Masters champion Mervyn King, who has tipped Hubbard as a player to watch in years to come. These sentiments were echoed by Simon Whitlock who practiced with Hubbard before the 2012 Grand Slam of Darts.

The school is an English Medium School established and managed by the Poona Diocesan Education Society. It is recognized by the Government of Maharashtra and consists of ten standards beyond Pre-Primary classes. It primarily prepares pupils for the Secondary School Certificate (S.S.C) Examination. St. Joseph Boys‚Äô High School aims at an inclusive education ‚Äì academic, physical, moral and spiritual ‚Äì primarily to Catholics, but welcoming children irrespective of religion or race as is consistent with Catholic principles. The patron St. Joseph is a model of living for its staff and students. History The missionary Rev. Fr. Bader, S.J.,then the Parish Priest of St. Ignatius Church, Kirkee, looked after the parish school from 1935-1949. In 1951, St. Joseph opened under the leadership of then Bishop Rt. Rev. Andrew D‚ÄôSouza. He invited the sisters of Trivandrum Carmelites to continue the school in English Medium, transitioning from Tamil Medium. St. Joseph Boys‚Äô High School was established on June 8, 1963. Location The school is situated in the northern part of Pune city, in the town of Kirkee, in the vicinity of the heritage monument of the St. Ignatius Church, the Court, and the Kirkee Cantonment Board.  Philosophy  The philosophy was defined by its founder principal Rev. Fr. Manuel Mascarenhas. Born into a well-off and well-educated family, he devoted himself to uplifting those in need. He declined offers to head elite schools in Pune to establish an institution where the need was higher. Khadki was a small suburb primarily populated by workers of the ammunition factory and those employed in the Khadki Cantonment. When he left the school, every child in Khadki would credit the school as having \\"done something for him\\". Facilities The school has grounds plus two storied quadrangular building where classrooms are situated. It has Physics, Chemistry and Biology labs. The school has two computer labs, a geography room, a music room, an audio-visual room, a gymnasium, a drawing room and a library. The school building is surrounded by a ground used for sports and an assembly ground featuring a basketball court. St Joseph's school has a big auditorium where various programmes and meetings are held regularly. Academics The school is divided into the pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher secondary sections. The school is affiliated to the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. 10th standard students give the S.S.C. exams respectively each year. Sports The school focuses in hockey and often competes in Inter-School Hockey Tournaments; seniors, juniors, sub-junior section titles have been won by the school. Khadki is thought by some to be the cradle of Indian hockey. The school shares this tradition with some other schools of Khadki area, and has won many laurels.

The Canadian Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal featured an inverted pyramid structure as well as a walk through an attraction called the \\"People Tree.\\" The pavilion had its highest single-day attendance on Canada Day (July 1), 1967. The pavilion's large inverted pyramid was called Katimavik, which is the Inuit word for \\"Gathering Place\\". The pyramid was nine storeys tall and supported by four columns. The building at its base housed a rotating theatre, which used moving wedge-shaped chambers to bring audiences from one screening to the next, making a complete revolution every half-hour. Smaller linked pyramids at ground level housed the exhibits \\"The Land of Canada,\\" \\"The Growth of Canada\\" and \\"The Challenge to Canadians and Canada and the World.\\" The pavilion was located on a 30,285 sq metre lot near the southern end of Notre Dame Island. It cost $24 million to build. The inverted pyramid was a 1000-ton structure, with a hollow steel frame. Open to the sky, its four inner sloping walls featured giant sculptures of a sun dial, hour glass, compass and Kyogen and Haida masks.For Canada's Sake, page 120 Design and construction Expo chief architect √âdouard Fiset had initially insisted the Canadian Pavilion be much smaller, confined to a single acre. Architect Rod Robbie felt strongly that Canada's pavilion had to have the largest site on the fair, demanding 11.5 acres. Robbie's vision was ultimately successful thanks to the support of federal minister Mitchell Sharp as well as Canadian Pavilion commissioner H. Leslie Brown. The inverted pyramid shape of the pavilion came about by chance. Robbie and his team were smokers, and while working with cardboard boxes as models for planned pavilion structures, someone placed a large, green, inverted pyramid-shaped ashtray, amidst the boxes. That became the inspiration for Katimavik. Architects The Canadian Pavilion was designed by architects Rod Robbie and Colin Vaughan of the firm Ashworth, Robbie, Vaughan and Williams Architects and Planners, Paul Schoeler of Schoeler, Barkham and Heaton Architects and Planning Consultants, and Matt Stankiewicz of Z. Matthew Stankiewicz Architect, with consulting architects Evans St. Gelais and Arthur Erickson. According to Robbie, his firm was selected over such competitors as John C. Parkin and Arcop. People Tree The People Tree in front of the pavilion was composed of images of Canadians printed on orange and red nylon sheets, with the colour representing a maple tree in autumn leaf colour. Sixty feet in height, the People Tree consisted of a thousand such \\"leaves,\\" with half bearing silk screened images of Canadians at work and play. The tree was accessed via a spiral staircase. Other structures To the northeast of the main pavilion, an Arts Centre featured a 500-seat theatre, a displays of art and handicrafts, and a reference library. The site also had a Children's Creative Centre, and a restaurant, \\"La Toundra\\".. The Canadian composer Otto Joachim composed a four-channel electroacoustic music composition that was played throughout the period of Expo 67.

An anticline is a fold that is concave down, whose limbs are dipping away from its axis, and whose oldest units are in the middle of the fold. These features form in a number of structural settings. In the case of river anticlines, they form due to high erosion rates, usually in orogenic settings. In a mountain building setting, like that of the Himalaya or the Andes, erosion rates are high and the river anticline's fold axis will trend parallel to a major river. When river anticlines form, they have a zone of uplift between 50-80 kilometers wide along the rivers that form them. Cause and effect The type of geologic feature that will form is caused by stream power and flexural rigidity of the crust. When stream power increases and flexural rigidity decreases, this causes the structure to progress from a transverse anticline to a river anticline, and in extreme cases to a tectonic aneurysm. Transverse anticlines trend in the direction of and form around small rivers with relatively high crustal strength. River anticlines form around large highly erosive rivers where crustal strength is relatively low. Tectonic aneurysms will form when erosion is very high and the crust is very weak, to form a structural welt. The way that river anticlines form via deep river incisions and the associated crustal rebound, cause rocks deep in the crust to be preferentially exhumed along large rivers like the Arun, Indus, Sutlej, and Yarlung Zangbo River. Isolated exhumation causes high pressure and ultra high pressure metamorphic sample to be brought to the surface at sustained rates of up to 5mm per year. Analysis and radiometric dating of these high pressure and ultra high pressure metamorphic rocks can help reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the orogenic belt that formed them. Evidence In the Himalaya, the Indian continental plate is crashing into the Eurasian continental plate with nearly north-south motion. Therefore, the compression of the rocks in the Himalaya is in the north-south direction. So, folding should occur trending east-west, as is observed. However, it has also been noted that folding occurs in the north-south direction. It was noted that these folds follow the traces of the major rivers, such as the Arun and the Indus. Originally these folds were explained by assuming that the rivers did not form these anticlines, instead the river's course was by coincidence on top of these geologic features, forming by differential erosion. The idea of isostatic rebound was suggested as the best fit mechanism for these north- south trending folds and is now widely accepted. Formation processes formation of a river anticline The formation of a river anticline by isostatic rebound is illustrated in the figure to the right in idealized steps. The principle of Isostasy says that if the lithosphere is free to move vertically, then it will float at an appropriate depth in the asthenosphere based on the thickness and density of the lithosphere. River anticlines form when huge amounts of material are removed by river erosion in an area with low crustal rigidity. The crust rebounds up specifically along the river, while the rest of the area remains relatively constant. This will bend the crust forming an anticline, which can take up to ten thousand years. As a river flows through the area, it erodes away large amounts of the overlying rock, which causes a decrease in the lithosphere's mass, leading to an isostatic response. With no overlying rock, the underlying material rebounds up, like removing a weight from a raft. As the river progresses the erosion continues and therefore the rebounding continues, which will form a low wide antiformal structure. For this rebound to occur the erosion from the river must exceed the average erosion rate for the area and exceed the uplift of the orogen. The average erosion rates for the Himalaya are about 1 mm per year, while the erosion rate for the Arun River of the eastern Himalaya is up to 8 mm per year, so it makes sense that we would see river anticlines along the Arun River. Tectonic aneurysms A tectonic aneurysm is an isolated zone of extreme uplift and exhumation rates. This forms when uplift from local tectonics are combined with very weak crust and uplift from a river anticline. When a major river flows over an area of tectonic uplift, the erosion from the river will erode the uplifted material. This will cause extremely rapid exhumation along the major rivers, of up to 10 mm per year. Within the Himalaya there are two tectonic aneurysms, each on one of the two syntaxis of the orogenic belt: Nanga Parbat in the west and Namche Barwa in the east. These tectonic aneurysms form in similar ways to river anticlines, but with extreme erosion rates and very weak and ductile crust. The syntaxis mark the end of the Himalayan orogen on either side and define the location of two large rivers, the Indus and the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The syntaxis on either side of the Himalaya are dominated by a strike slip fault zone, instead of a compressional thrust faulting, as in the rest of the orogen. In the west the Indus River flows through the Nanga Parbat and in the east the Yarlung Tsangpo River flows through the Namche Barwa. The very high erosion rates of these two rivers is coupled with weak, hot, thin, dry, crust to form areas of extreme uplift and exhumation. Figure 1: A diagram of a young tectonic aneurysm. Isothermal gradient anticline caused by channel incision creating a thinner crust than the surrounding. Strain is focused into weakness forcing warm material into the zone thereby lifting isotherms locally Figure 2: An advanced tectonic aneurysm. Isothermal gradient becomes more advanced than in the young stage. Material flow causes surface uplift of young rock on the peripheral edges of the erosion area. The uplift brings weak warm rocks to the surface and creates high relief. This causes accelerated mass wasting and easier erosion thereby enforcing the positive feedback Figure 3: This diagram contrasts the crustal strength of a landscape with significant localized erosion(Blue Dashed Line) when compared to an unmodified landscape (Green Dashed Line). The strength profile illustrated in the diagram is only in the brittle zone with an assumed constant increase with depth on the basis of increased pressure with increased overlying mass. =Deformation mechanism= Deformation caused by tectonic aneurysms are similar to aneurysms in blood vessels in which weakening of the confining force allows for localized growth or uplift. However, in the geological setting, deformation occurs over millions of years with significant sustained erosion power ranging from tens of hundreds of kiloWatts per meter.Zeitler, P., Hallet, B., & Koons, P. (2013). Tectonic aneurysms and mountain building Incision or crustal thinning of an area on the surface relative to the background crust thickness causes two things to occur that allow for aneurysm formation. Firstly, due to the brittle nature of crustal rocks and their pressure dependent strength, the decrease in overlying material depresses the crustal strength when compared to surrounding areas. This occurs because the removal of crust decreases the overburden and thus the pressure which influences the strength. Secondly, the geothermal gradient increases vertically. Localized deep valleys create weakest areas that focus strain and thereby the movement of deep ductile material. By weakening the crust in a localized area, a preferential region of strain can develop concentrating the flow of material. Ductile rocks deeper in the crust will be able to move towards the potential gradient, whereas brittle rocks near the surface will fracture when subject to increased strain. The transition between brittle deformation and ductile deformation is determined by the temperature which is generally controlled by depth as well as rheology. Weak hot minerals, below the ductile transition, with significant partial melt move into the area underlying the thinned crust as a result of the pressure gradient being decreased in the thin area. At a certain point, the pressure will decrease substantially moving from convergent basement rock into thinned crust. This causes rapid decompression at relatively stable and raised isotherms. Decompression melting occurs, which increases the proportion of partial melt within the material and causes rapid heat advection towards the surface. Continued convergent plate movement focuses the flow of material into the syntaxial areas with the localized weakness permitting upward escape as an accommodation mechanism. This process solves the fundamental problem of material being forced into a confined space by creating an outlet. The result of which creates a positive feedback with erosion focusing uplift which transports more weak rock vertically enhancing erosive capabilities. Areas of consistent elevation in river valleys and mountains with relief can be maintained by high exhumation rates of relatively young weak rocks. The ages of minerals in the area will be younger than the surrounding crust due to cooling occurring in an area with a steeper thermal gradient at shallower depths. Mature tectonic aneurysm systems, such as the Nanga Parbat, can have very high local reliefs of young rocks due to consistent erosion maintaining the elevation in the erosive area and vertical strain forcing material up along the proximal edges. =Locations= Tectonic aneurysms are found in areas with localized high relief of relatively young rocks when compared to their surroundings. Actively observed systems that have been studied the most are located in 2 main regions of the Himalaya, the Nanga Parbat‚ÄìHaramosh Massif and Namche Barwa‚ÄìGyala Peri which occur on the Eastern and Western edges respectively. The Indus River is the mechanism responsible for crustal removal in the Nanga Parbat region, and the Tsangpo River is active in the Namche Barwa region. Proposed tectonic aneurysms are located in the Saint Elias region of Alaska, the Kongur Shan and Muztagh Ata in China, and the Lepontine Dome in the Swiss Alps. These locations show incipient or similar, less significant characteristics to actively observed systems. Glacial mechanisms of erosion and transport are believed to be responsible in many alpine areas including the Saint Elias system. Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Tectonic Aneurysm The Nanga Parbat-Haramosh is the most studied region in the context of tectonic aneurysms. The region has extreme relief over very short distances with the Indus River valley approximately 7 kilometers lower in elevation than the peak of the mountain. Within the study area, Biotite cooling ages (280 ¬∞C ¬± 40 ¬∞C) are consistently less than 10 million years old indicating rapid exhumation rates in the area. Studies of composition and structure of the rocks in the area suggest exhumation of depths below 20 kilometers. Exhumation rates from the massif and the valley are significantly higher than background rates. Calculations of peak exhumation rates range from 5 to 12 mm per year depending on the location.The mountain top has a lower rate than the bottom of the valley yet both are significantly higher when compared to background rates outside of the syntax. Exposed granulite within the central aneurysm area represents low-pressure melting and advection as material moved into areas with decreasing pressure. Up to 20 kilometers of domal unroofing over a very short period of time has been inferred based on the sample ages ranging from 1 to 3 million years. Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri The Namche Barwa-Gayla Peri tectonic aneurysm is located on the Eastern side of the Himalaya with the active Tsangpo River flowing down the valley between the mountains. Many researchers conclude the tectonic aneurysm model is the best explanation of the observed structures and tectonic arrangement of the region. The argon-argon biotite ages and zircon fission track ages of rocks from the area are 10 million years old or less, which is young compared to the surrounding rocks. Similar high reliefs seen in the Nanga Parbat are also evident with the Namche Barwa region, with approximately 4 kilometers of vertical elevation change over a short horizontal distance. High and low-grade metamorphic rocks are found in the region with evidence to suggest a variation of metamorphic activity between regions from the strain center and the edges. The exhumation occurs in a circular area with young, high-grade decompression melts focused in the center. Around the outside of the focus rubidium to strontium ratios suggest melting with fluid present. The presence of fluid within melt has been modeled to occur as a result of immense precipitation allowing water to penetrate into shallow crustal rocks over long periods of time. Ages and barometric regimes of the rocks were used to calculate the volume of overburden removed, which was used to determine 3 millimeters of annual incision over the last 10 million years. Saint Elias The proposed four million years old tectonic aneurysm system in the Saint Elias Mountains in Alaska was formed by glacial erosion on the mountains developed by underthrusting of the Yakutat microplate beneath the North American margin. The aneurysm occurs in the Northern plate corner in which transitions from dextral strike-slip motion to thrust sense motion thereby focusing strain. The interpreted relationship between erosion mountain development has more variations between researchers than Himalayan systems due to the age of the system and constraints regarding field work due to glacier cover. In the St. Elias range collision and underthrusting caused surface uplift forming mountains. The elevation increase climate regime allowed glacier development resulting in extreme glacial erosion potential. Since its inception, glacial erosion transported sediments West into the Pacific Ocean and onto the continental margin. After which, approximately two million years ago, the formation of a d√©collement caused the locus of strain to propagate south. The shift in strain focus resulted in mountain development farther South which disrupted the climatic system thereby decreasing precipitation in Northern regions of the Saint Elias Mountains. The erosion and exhumation are now concentrated on the southern portion of the mountain range which produces young cooling ages associated with the current tectonic aneurysm center. Young detrital zircon fission track dating (240 ¬∞C ¬± 40 ¬∞C) and apatite fission track and uranium -thorium/ helium (110 ¬∞C ¬± 10 ¬∞C) cooling ages of sediments in glacial catchment areas support the theory of erosive influence on the St. Elias tectonic system. Rates of exhumation were inferred by calculating the difference between detrital zircon and apatite ages in sediments. The smaller the difference between zircon and apatite ages represents a faster movement of material through the isotherms and faster cooling. In the northern corner of contact between the plates, the zircon and apatite ages do not differ significantly, thereby providing evidence of rapid exhumation. The proximity to the depositional environment along the coastal margin and within fjords preserves a record of sedimentation rate which is used to interpret exhumation rates of 0.3 mm year originally and approximately 1.3 mm/year for the last million years. The sediment age and thickness are used to track the movement of the focus of erosion from the north to the south. The presence of a definitive tectonic aneurysm system in the region is widely disputed with many researchers concluding insufficient focused exhumation is occurring to support the hypothesis. Significant glacial cover limits the number of field samples and geological observations that can be made directly on the surface thereby adding uncertainty to interpretations. Alternative theories argue tectonic transpressional control of exhumation with little erosive influence on the overall system. Younger ages are explained by focused strain areas resulting from faulting. =Field work in proposed regions= By comparing the depth in Earth at which particular minerals crystallize and the elevation at which they were sampled, the age of minerals can be used to determine the rate which the strain zone moved material vertically. Various dating methods on specific fluid inclusions and minerals were used in order to provide chronological data of the exhumation rate of rocks in the area. The age dates were used to reconstruct the history of exhumation and thermal regimes by comparing them to pressure and temperature crystallization boundaries of the minerals. Uranium- thorium and uranium-helium cooling ages of samples of apatite indicate the timing of 70 ¬∞C cooling. Higher closure temperatures were dated using argon‚Äìargon dating methods for biotite samples (300 ¬∞C) and zircon fission track dating (230 ¬∞C - 250 ¬∞C) methods. By analyzing the ages of minerals with various closure temperatures, researchers can infer the speed at which they moved through the isotherms. When the difference between the age of a mineral that cooled at a high temperature and one that cooled at a low temperature are relatively similar, then exhumation is inferred to be rapid. The geothermobarometry is obtained using garnet-biotite plagioclase in order to constrain higher pressure metamorphic regimes. Shallower exhumation rates (low-temperature cooling ages) alone can not realistically be used to describe tectonic aneurysms as deep isothermal gradient changes may not significantly affect shallower depths. Furthermore, shallow low-temperature cooling can be more largely related to erosion dominated exposure rather than tectonic driven uplift. Sample ages from minerals with higher cooling temperatures signify exhumation of deeper material which is the modeled function of a tectonic aneurysm. Seismic velocity profiles are often used over large study areas in order to identify possible isothermal irregularities. Low-velocity data is indicative of hotter rocks with a higher degree of the partial melt which slows P-waves when compared to the surroundings. Magnetotelluric sampling is done to test the resistivity of the rocks which is used to infer the amount of fluid in the rocks.

The by- election in the Christchurch South electorate was contested by Robert Macfarlane for Labour and Melville Lyons for National, with Macfarlane winning the election. At the time, Macfarlane was Mayor of Christchurch. Background Since the first election of Ted Howard in the 1919 general election, Christchurch South was held by the Labour Party. At the last general election in 1938, Howard had polled 9,885 votes versus 3,890 votes for Gladstone Ward, the son of former Prime Minister Joseph Ward. When Howard died on 26 April 1939, the electorate was thus regarded as a safe seat for Labour. On nomination day, two candidates were put forward: Robert Macfarlane for the Labour Party and Melville Lyons for the National Party. Mabel Howard, Ted Howard's daughter, had hoped to be put forward by the Labour Party, and she was endorsed by the local branch of the party. The national executive of the Labour Party chose Macfarlane, and Howard believed that she was opposed by the party's hierarchy due to her connections to John A. Lee, who was seen as a radical within the party. The chosen candidate, Macfarlane, had been Mayor of Christchurch since the previous year. Results Results of the Christchurch South general election held on 15 October 1938 were: Results of the by- election held on 3 June 1939 were: There were 20 polling booths and Lyons obtained a majority at only two of those (at Kilmore Street and at the Provincial Chambers in Durham Street). Macfarlane could increase the Labour vote at one polling booth only (Antigua Street in Sydenham). Macfarlane stated that in his belief, about 2,000 Labour Party supporters did not vote because the outcome of the election was a foregone conclusion. This view was disputed in an editorial by The Evening Post, arguing that the reduced Labour support is due to Howard's popularity that Macfarlane does not possess despite many high-profile politicians having campaigned on Labour's behalf, and that it is more likely that National supporters have suffered from apathy, as Lyons never had any hope of winning the election. Macfarlane held the electorate until its abolition at the 1946 general election and subsequently Christchurch Central until the 1969 general election, when he retired.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The castle was the seat of the counts of Werdenberg-Sargans in the 13th century. Since 1899, it has been run by the local church and now houses the Sarganserland museum. History Beginning in 982 the Sargans region was part of the lands of the Counts of Bregenz. In 1160, the male line of the Counts of Bregenz died out. Count palatine Hugo of T√ºrbingen inherited most of their lands, through his wife Elisabeth. His son, Hugo, inherited the Bregenz lands around Lake Constance, including Sargans. This Hugo, who adopted the name Montfort und Werdenberg built or expanded Sargans Castle before his death in 1228. Excavations around the oldest part of the castle show that there was an earlier fort or castle, but nothing is known about that building. Hugo built the large bergfried, expanded the walls to the west and may have built a palas on that side of the castle. In the mid-13th century the Montfort und Werdenberg lands were divided between Hugo of Werdenberg-Heiligenberg and his brother Hartmann of Werdenberg-Sargans. Hartmann took up residence in the castle and probably expanded the palas. The castle was first mentioned in 1282. Over the following century the wealth and lands of the Counts of Werdenberg-Sargans were divided over and over again between descendants. By the last 14th century, Count Johann I ruled over a small and poor county under the Habsburgs. In the Battle of N√§fels in 1388, the count commanded a wing of the Austrian army that was supposed to cross the Kerenzerberg Pass. However, when he saw the threatened destruction of the main Austrian army, he fled back over the pass.

BTC City is a shopping mall, sports, entertainment and business area in Ljubljana, Slovenia, with more than 500 shops. It is one of the largest shopping and entertainment complexes in Europe. Most of the shops are located at the official address 152 ≈†martno Street (, Ljubljana). History In 1954, a company named Centralna skladi≈°ƒça (Central Warehouses) was founded with a founding contract. Central Warehouses expanded their operations by starting to carry out the warehousing activities also for other companies, which were not among the co-founders of the company. Due to the expansion of the activity and the extent of operations, the company changed its name to Javna skladi≈°ƒça (Public Warehouses). In 1975, the company became the largest goods and transport centre in former Yugoslavia. In the same year, Javna skladi≈°ƒça changed its name to Blagovno Transportni Center Ljubljana (Ljubljana Goods and Transport Centre, BTC). 1990 presents a turning point for BTC. In search and confirmation of the entrepreneurial freedom, the company decided to change its name to Blagovno Trgovinski Center (Goods and Shopping Centre) and the company, which, up to that point, managed warehousing space, transformed itself to a public limited company in 1990, becoming responsible for the selection of new, profitable, compatible and competitive programmes and business contents, and suitable infrastructure as well. First individual stores started opening. In 1993, when the management of the company was taken over by Jo≈æe Mermal, the empty warehousing facilities began to acquire a new, more attractive image, and the first shops formed in the renovated Hall A. In 1994, the company stocks were quoted on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange. In 1997, the public limited company BTC became an international capital company, as its shares were the listed at the London Stock Exchange as shares of the first Slovenian company. Soon afterwards, the Frankfurt and Munich Stock Exchanges followed. Facilities BTC City has a total gross area of more than 250,000 m2. It includes a main shopping mall called CityPark, 16 smaller shopping malls, a multiplex with twelve screens, the recently opened Plaza Hotel Ljubljana, a market, a mini golf course, a waterpark with a spa center and an entertainment center with a casino, bowling, 3D cinema as well as two high rise office buildings.

Location  The Moltke Watchtower is located in the Lower Harz in the Harz/Saxony-Anhalt Nature Park. It is also within the South Harz Karst Landscape Biosphere Reserve, just south of Lengefeld in the municipality of Sangershausen. The tower stands on the hill known as the Schl√∂√üchenkopf or Hoher Berg, (), which rises to the east of the valley of the Brechtewendische Bach. About 1.1 km east of the tower is the large, cone-shaped tip on the Hohe Linde, a reminder of the copper shale (Kupferschiefer) mining that used to be carried out in the nearby Thomas M√ºnzer Shaft.  History  The Moltke Tower was built in 1903 of roestone (Rogenstein) and opened on 26 October that year. Its sponsor was the Sangerhausen branch of the Harz Club. The monument was inaugurated by the Prussian field marshal, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke (1800‚Äì1891). During the East German period the tower became dilapidated and, as a result, it was and thoroughly renovated in 1995 as part of a job creation scheme by the municipal redevelopment company, Sangerhausen mbH. Since 2007, there have been commemorative events on 11 March for the German resistance fighter, Helmuth James von Moltke (1907‚Äì1945).  Views and hiking  From the viewing platform (ca. 336 metres above sea level), which is accessible at weekends and public holidays in the warmer months, there are good views, of the Goldene Aue, the Kyffh√§user hills, of Lengefeld and the nearby mine of R√∂hrigschacht near Wettelrode. The tower is also No. 209 in the system of checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network; the green box is in the refuge hut next to the observation tower.

Company profile Africo was founded in 2006 as a spin-off from Rubicon Minerals, and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Apart from the main Kalukundi project, the company has an agreement to purchase the highly speculative Mashitu adjoining property. It also has rights to three large- scale licenses to explore for gold, nickel and copper in Zambia's Mporokoso sedimentary basin. In April 2007 Africo Resources raised C$130-million to fund development of the Kalukundi property. In November 2007 the International Finance Corporation agreed to provide a loan of about $40-million, subject to risk assessment. As of September 2008 the company had a market capitalization of C$120 million. In February 2009 Africo reached an agreement with the DRC government on amendments to the Kalakundi mining contract. It agreed to pay Gecamines an additional $1.6 million annually for four years on top of the existing 2.5% royalty on gross sales payable to Gecamines. Shares prices shot up after the announcement. In November 2011 market capitalization had sunk to C$54.2 million. Kalukundi ownership dispute The Kalukundi property is owned by Swanmines, which is jointly owned by Africo Resources (75%) and the state-owned Kalumines (25%). In 2007 there was an ownership dispute when a DRC company named Akam Mining claimed it had bought control of Swanmines, and this claim was upheld in a superior court in Lubumbashi. In September 2007 Africo said \\"third parties\\" were trying to steal its Kalukundi asset through the \\"systematic misuse of the judicial system\\". Later that month the DRC justice minister Georges Minsay Booka directed G√©camines to take note that Akam Mining had no stake in the property. In October Africo said it had received a letter from Mo√Øse Katumbi Chapwe, the Governor of Katanga, confirming that Akam did not own shares in the subsidiary company. Resource estimates A 2006 feasibility study estimated the Kalukundi Mine could produce 800,000 tonnes of ore per year, giving an estimated annual yield of 16,400 tonnes of copper and 3,800 tonnes of cobalt. Ore would be extracted by a contractor using conventional open pit selective exploitation, with multiple pits and multiple cut-back to ensure a steady supply of ore. A revised study was commissioned in June 2011 to investigate a 50% higher rate of ore production, and to take into account the much higher metal prices. Social involvement In October 2007 Africo's Swanmines subsidiary signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the DRC Ministry for Social Affairs. The company pledged to align social development programs the local areas of need the Ministry identified. This was the first agreement of this kind to be signed by any mining company in Katanga province. In December 2008 Africo was given an award for its outstanding and innovative community service in the Katanga Copperbelt, including Africo's Wheelchairs for Kids program.

It operated from 1969 until 1986. The train was one of the few Illinois Central trains Amtrak retained after the end of most private-sector passenger service in the United States on May 1, 1971. The Shawnee operated until January 12, 1986, when budget cuts led to its consolidation with the Illini. The Shawnee took its name from the Shawnee, an Algonquian-speaking people native to North America who formerly lived in southern Illinois. The train made its first run on June 3, 1969. It replaced the Seminole, a long- distance train which had operated between Chicago and Jacksonville since 1909. At the dawn of Amtrak the Shawnee was one of several trains the Illinois Central operated over the Chicago--Carbondale corridor, including the Southern Express, Creole, and Louisiane. Along with the Panama Limited, also retained from the IC, the Shawnee continued to use Central Station instead of Union Station in downtown Chicago. Its rolling stock consisted of inherited Illinois Central Gulf locomotives and passenger cars, but in 1976 they were replaced with GE P30CHes and Amfleets and for a brief time, they used Superliner cars. The 1980s most likely saw introduction of EMD F40PHs and retaining of Amfleets, as the Superliners were sent on other routes. On 12 October 1979, a northbound train was involved in an accident at Harvey, Illinois, when the train collided with a stationary ICG freight train due to misaligned switches, claiming the lives of 2 people.

It was declared on 12 November 2011, following several months of support by Darfuri rebel groups for the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North in the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Composition The alliance created in November 2011 aimed to bring together the two main factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, as well as the other major rebel group in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement, with rebels in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The declaration of the SRF's formation was delayed until a disagreement between JEM and the other factions on the role of Islam in a post-revolutionary federal government was resolved. The signers for each group were Yasir Arman for the SPLM-N, Ahmed Tugud for the JEM, Abul Gassim Al-Haj for the SLM-al-Nur, and Al-Rayah Mahmoud for the SLM-Minnawi. Areas of operation Yasir Arman, the secretary-general of the SPLM-N and a prominent member of the SRF's high political committee, said shortly after the SRF's formation that \\"all Sudan is a theatre for operations, including Khartoum\\". , the JEM and both SLM factions were still based in the region of Darfur, and the SPLM-N had not expanded its fight against the Sudanese government north of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. In late December 2011, JEM fighters advanced into North Kordofan with the stated intention of ousting President Omar al- Bashir from power, though they suffered a setback when their leader, Khalil Ibrahim, was killed in action in the state. Around the time of the SRF's formation in November 2011, the Sudanese government accused neighbouring South Sudan of supporting the rebel groups. In addition to bombing South Sudanese infrastructure and camps, South Sudanese authorities stated that Sudan had backed armed opposition factions within South Sudan. Sudanese peace process The August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace agreement for resolving the War in Darfur and the Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile be made within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. As part of the resulting Sudanese peace process, on 21 October 2019, el-Hadi Idris, on behalf of the SRF, and Hemetti, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council (the collective head of state), signed a political agreement (co-signed by a South Sudanese mediator) including a renewed ceasefire, the delivering of humanitarian assistance by government agencies to areas under conflict, and commitment to negotiate further. On 31 August 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese authorities and rebel factions led by Gibril Ibrahim, Minni Minnawi, el-Hadi Idris and Malik Agar to end armed hostilities. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to three seats on the sovereignty council, a total of five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled between 30 and 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states or regions.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sudan-darfur/sudan-signs-peace-deal- with-key-rebel-groups-some-hold-out- idUKKBN25R14Thttps://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/historic- agreement-signed-by-sudan-govt-armed-groups-in-juba See also *Sudanese Awakening Revolutionary Council References Category:2011 establishments in Sudan Category:Rebel groups in Sudan Category:Rebel groups that actively control territory ","title":"Sudan Revolutionary Front"},{"id":"33737906","text":"Tarje Nordstrand Jacobsen (born 5 May 1974) is a Norwegian former footballer from Molde.

As its name suggests, the chair had both a gong and signal connected to it.Merritt, Deborah J. ‚ÄúHypatia in the Patent Office: Women Inventors and the Law, 1865-1900.‚Äù The American Journal of Legal History, vol. 35, no. 3, 1991, pp. 235‚Äì306. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/845974. Accessed 30 Apr. 2020. The chair would \\"reduce the expenses of hotels by decreasing the number of waiters and attendants, to add to the convenience and comfort of guests and to obviate the necessity of hand clapping or calling aloud to obtain the services of pages.\\" The chair worked when the person sitting would press a small button on the back of the chair which would then send a signal to a waiting attendant. A light would illuminate as well, allowing the attendant to see which guest needed help. The system was eventually adopted by the United States House of Representatives and was a precursor to the signaling system used on airplanes for passengers to seek assistance from flight attendants. Career Upon her move to Washington, D.C., Benjamin became a teacher in the segregated municipal school system. In 1888, she was living at 1736 New York Avenue, N.W. in Washington.Boyd's Directory of the District of Columbia(Washington, 1888), 208 Miriam Benjamin briefly attended Howard University's medical school,Lamb, 235 but after passing a competitive civil service examination and working as a government clerk in a number of federal departments,Boyd's Directory of the District of Columbia (Washington, 1891), 212 she enrolled in the law school at Howard University.

The actor spent two years auditioning for a role on the show, before he was offered the part of Geoff. He was surprised to get the part as he thought his audition had not been very good. Lewis relocated to Sydney for filming and he cut his long hair for the character. His casting was announced on 17 June 2007, while he made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 June 2007. After two years on the show, Lewis quit Home and Away and filmed his final scenes on 18 September 2009. The character made his screen exit on 12 February 2010. Geoff was portrayed as being an innocent, honest and sensible teenager throughout his duration. Geoff was a devout Christian and a rugby league footballer. He and his sister Annie (Charlotte Best) were raised by their religious grandfather, Bruce (Chris Haywood) on the family farm, following their parents deaths. Due to his upbringing, Geoff's social skills were not the same as other teenagers his age. Geoff developed an \\"on and off\\" friendship with Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) and his storylines often revolved around his romantic relationships. Geoff's first love interest was the equally inexperienced Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). He then dated Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) and lost his virginity to her, while they were stranded on an island. Geoff also dated Claudia Hammond (Alexandra Park) and was led to believe that he was the father of her baby. For his portrayal of Geoff, Lewis won the Most Popular New Male Talent Logie Award. Casting On 17 June 2007, Angela Cuming of The Sun-Herald reported Lewis had joined the cast of Home and Away. The actor had previously auditioned for a role on the show for two years, before finally impressing the producers. During an interview published in Inside Soap, Lewis revealed that he had auditioned for Ric Dalby in 2004, making it down to the final three, before Mark Furze got the part. Then in 2007, Lewis auditioned for Drew Curtis and made it to the final two ‚Äì only for Bobby Morley to be given the role. Of the moment he learned he had secured a role in Home and Away, Lewis said \\"I was in a furniture shop with my mum and aunty when [the producers] called to say I had got the job. I started screaming and running around. I am just so stoked to be here doing this and it still hasn't really sunk in yet.\\" Lewis was surprised to get the role of Geoff as he thought his audition had been \\"terrible\\". Lewis relocated to Sydney, where Home and Away is shot, and he had to cut his long hair short for the part. Lewis made his screen debut as Geoff on 20 June 2007. Development =Characterisation= Chris Haywood played Geoff's grandfather, Bruce. Prior to his introduction, Geoff was described as being a farm boy, a football player and Summer Bay High's newest student. Carolyn Stewart from TV Week thought Geoff was an innocent, sporty teenager. Lewis stated that the first thing he knew about Geoff was that he was a rugby league footballer. He was \\"over the moon\\" as football and acting were two of his passions in his life. The actor thought Geoff's best quality was his honesty, but observed that his social skills were not up to \\"a normal teenager's standards\\". A writer for the show's official website described Geoff as being \\"sensible and serious\\" and having a \\"grim, hard-working life\\". Geoff was a devout Christian, who planned to become a priest when he grew up. Lewis commented that while he was not as \\"diehard religious\\" as Geoff, he did believe. He added \\"Playing this character has been an eye-opening experience for me, as it's allowed me to see things from the perspective of someone who's very strong in their beliefs.\\" Geoff and his sister Annie (Charlotte Best) were raised by their \\"super-religious\\" grandfather, Bruce (Chris Haywood), after their parents died in a car crash. The loss of his parents and the firm hand of his grandfather, helped to shape Geoff into \\"a very responsible boy who is black and white about right and wrong.\\" Geoff, Annie and Bruce lived at the family farm on the outskirts of Summer Bay and Bruce home-schooled the siblings. However, Geoff was later sent to an all boys boarding school for two years. Lewis agreed that he and Best had a \\"natural brother-and-sister chemistry\\" on-screen because they both have siblings in real life and were able to relate to one another. He also said that he and Best got on great and enjoyed \\"taking the mickey\\" out of each other like a real brother and sister. =Friendship with Aden Jefferies= Geoff's love of football and his faith made him stand out from other guys his age. He developed an \\"on and off\\" friendship with Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). Aden disliked Geoff at first due to the fact that Geoff was more talented at football and to Aden, represented \\"the hypocrisy of society.\\" Aden was convinced that Geoff was just \\"as flawed as everyone else, and just as full of sin.\\" The two eventually matured and became friends. Off-screen, Lasance and Lewis were close friends and while they lived together, they learned lines and critiqued each other's performances. After dropping out of school, Geoff found himself at a loose end and thought he and Aden could work together on a prawn trawler. Geoff believed that it was just the thing to pull Aden \\"out of his funk\\" following the death of his wife. Aden and Geoff found working together harder than they anticipated and their tempers soon got the better of them. When they clashed over how to repair the trawler, Geoff lashed out and punches were thrown. They both came into contact with the trawler's electric wiring, which left Geoff having to rescue Aden. Lewis loved the constant feud between his and Lasance's characters. He admitted that they would \\"amp it up\\" as much as they could. =Relationships= Melody Jones Because of Geoff's background, he was \\"completely clueless\\" when it came to girls. He was insecure, but he eventually shared a kiss with the equally inexperienced Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Lewis thought that Geoff and Melody were similar as they were both naive and had sheltered upbringings. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) took advantage of that and convinced Geoff that Melody \\"dumped him\\" because their first kiss was so bad. Nicole told Geoff that if he wanted Melody back, then he would have to become a better kisser and she offered to teach him. Geoff became determined to work things out with Melody and accepted Nicole's help. Speaking to an Inside Soap columnist, Lewis explained \\"Geoff thinks something's not right about it ‚Äì surely Melody wouldn't ditch him after just one bad kiss? But every time he sees Melody now, she's stand-offish.\\" Unbeknownst to Geoff, Melody was under the impression that he was being unfaithful to her with Nicole. Having seen them both together, Melody jumped to the wrong conclusion. Nicole did not correct her and went out of her way to stir up trouble. Nicole was frustrated that Geoff was not falling for her, so she set out to sabotage his relationship with Melody instead. Nicole Franklin Tessa James played Geoff's love interest Nicole Franklin. Geoff became involved in \\"a sordid love triangle\\" with Melody and Nicole, which left viewers guessing which girl he would end up with. Geoff and Nicole eventually began dating. James thought Nicole was the one for Geoff, but Geoff might not be the one for Nicole. Lewis believed that his character had \\"deep feelings\\" for Nicole. During an interview published in Inside Soap, James said Geoff and Nicole were complete opposites, but it worked in their favour. She called their relationship \\"fiery\\" and thought they had been through a lot together. Lewis commented that Geoff and Nicole were very similar in some of their traits, as they were both stubborn and opinionated. He told Jason Herbison that when Geoff first started dating Nicole, he had a lot of parents and grandparents tell him that Geoff should be with Melody instead, because Nicole was not a good influence. James believed that if Geoff and Nicole broke up, they would still stay good friends. While Lewis added that as long as Geoff and Nicole wanted to be together, they could work through anything. Geoff and Nicole were dumped at sea together by Elliot Gillen (Paul Pantano) when he sought revenge against Nicole's father. The couple washed up on a deserted island, where Geoff nursed his injuries from a fight with Elliot. Neither of them knew where they were and were forced to survive without food, clothing and shelter. Geoff and Nicole tried to light a fire and catch some fish, but were not very successful. James called the situation \\"hopeless\\", but said that when they found ways to make each other laugh, they realised how much they meant to each other. Lewis thought that it did not help that both of them were almost naked. Geoff lost his virginity to Nicole, which left him feeling guilty because he was saving himself for marriage. At the time, he felt it was right for him, but later believed that he should have been stronger. Once they were rescued, Geoff and Nicole returned to the Bay and their romance took another shock turn. Because he and Nicole had sex before marriage, Geoff felt the only way to make things right was to ask Nicole to marry him. Geoff believed that if he and Nicole were going to have sex again, they should be married. Though he was not one hundred per cent sure about it, he felt a wedding was the only solution. Lewis did not think a proposal was a good idea and quipped that Geoff was not ready to tie his own shoelaces. The proposal came as a surprise to Nicole, who turned it down and then vented her disgust at the suggestion. James quipped \\"She's really offended ‚Äì it's as though Geoff's ashamed of what happened between them.\\" Nicole saw the proposal as an attempt to fix a mistake. Nicole found it odd that Geoff thought they should get married at such a young age, and it killed the passion between them and spoiled their relationship. When Nicole surprised Geoff with a romantic getaway to the island where they first had sex, the couple were faced with \\"a homicidal madman\\" called Derrick Quaid (John Atkinson). The storyline started while Geoff and Nicole's relationship was going through a rough patch. Nicole thought a trip away would help them overcome their issues. Lewis told Stewart that Geoff loved the surprise at first, but everything about Nicole made Geoff question his beliefs about premarital sex and whenever they started to get close, Geoff knew that he could give in again and so he tried to back away. Things got worse for the couple when Derreck, a complete stranger, turned up at their camp. Derreck tried to intimidate Geoff and Nicole and prevented Geoff from calling for help. Geoff and Nicole tried to get away from Derreck, but he pulled out a fishing knife, causing Geoff to panic. When asked if Geoff was scared, Lewis replied \\"He is ‚Äì but, to be honest, he's actually more scared for Nicole's life than his own. Being the kind of guy he is, Geoff puts everyone else before himself. He cares about Nicole more than anyone else in the world and would risk everything to save her.\\" Geoff and Nicole's relationship started to crumble and they were constantly \\"at each other's throats\\". When Geoff gave her a meaningful gift of a tree cutting, Nicole was unimpressed. Geoff was devastated when he overheard Nicole \\"dissing\\" the gift and he broke up with her. Claudia Hammond Geoff started flirting with his primary school friend, Claudia Hammond (Alexandra Park), at a wedding. He made eye contact with her and kept sneaking over to see her. Geoff had only just broken up with Nicole and a TV Week reporter questioned whether it was the \\"real thing\\" or a rebound romance. After Geoff had sex with Claudia for the first time, they became trapped in a fire that engulfed their caravan. Lewis told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that when Geoff awoke to find the caravan in flames, he initially believed that he had gone to hell as punishment for having sex before marriage. The fire was started accidentally when a fight between Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Trey Palmer (Luke Bracey) got out of hand. Lewis explained \\"They accidentally knock over a barrel which has a fire burning inside it, and a caravan goes up in flames. The pair have no idea that Geoff and Claudia are in there, though.\\" As the fire continued to engulf the caravan, Geoff realised that Claudia was succumbing to smoke inhalation. He helped get her out through a window, before collapsing and having to be rescued by Jai and Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart). Lewis told Herbison that Geoff thought he was going to die and once he is safe, he can only think about Claudia. Once Geoff got to the hospital, he discovered that Claudia had lied about her previous relationship ending. He found Claudia talking to a guy he did not recognise and soon learned that he was her on-off boyfriend Lachie Cladwell (Jackson Heywood). Claudia had told Geoff that she and Lachie were broken up, but that was not the case. When Lachie realised who Geoff was, he punched him in the stomach and warned him to stay away from his girlfriend. Claudia later discovered that she was pregnant and she and Geoff were forced to consider their future. Due to Geoff's strict religious background, it was hard for him when everyone learnt that Claudia was expecting. Lewis explained \\"His sister, Annie, is disappointed, as Geoff's gone against what they were taught.\\" Claudia's father was not supportive of the couple and he kicked his daughter out, which added to the pressure that Geoff was already feeling. Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) allowed the couple to stay with her, while Geoff tried to keep the news a secret from his guardian Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). When Claudia admitted to Annie that she was thinking about having an abortion, Geoff was shocked as it went against his faith. Things got too much for Geoff and he went away for a couple of days to think about the situation. Of the pregnancy and Claudia and Geoff's relationship, series producer Cameron Welsh stated \\"It's not as clear cut as it probably looks on the surface. There's more going on there in their relationship and more than what we can probably see right now. It's an interesting story and will develop over the next couple of weeks.\\" Lachie later tried to injure Geoff during a rugby match, but Geoff tackled Lachie hard, leaving him with no feeling in his legs. While they were at the hospital, Geoff and Claudia were \\"full of guilt\\" and Geoff tried to apologise to Lachie. Claudia then admitted to Geoff that the baby was not his, but Lachie's. A \\"furious\\" Geoff then ordered her to leave. Ruby Buckton Rebecca Breeds played Ruby Buckton. Geoff developed a romance with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) just before his departure. Breeds said that there was \\"a lot of love between them\\" and that they had a beautiful relationship. She also said that while circumstances changed, their feelings did not. When Geoff and Ruby decided to get intimate, Ruby took the initiative to make it special between them. Breeds thought Geoff and Ruby were a great couple and commented that Geoff had a level of maturity that Ruby's ex-boyfriend did not have. She also enjoyed working with Lewis and believed that they had a good chemistry together. Lewis told TV Week's Carolyn Stewart that it took Geoff and Ruby about a year to work out what was going between them. He continued \\"I don't want to bring Twilight into it ‚Äì and the vampire dude that I don't like! ‚Äì but he can't be with the girl he loves and it kills him. That's what Geoff does to Ruby. He soon realises it doesn't help one little bit, but you'll have to watch to see exactly how everything happens!\\" =Departure= On 17 September 2009, it was announced that Lewis had quit Home and Away after two years. Of his exit, the actor stated \\"It's sad to be leaving the cast and crew on Home and Away. It was a hard decision to make, but I also think it's the right time to go.\\" The actor filmed his final scenes as Geoff on 18 September. He later commented that fans could expect \\"a perfect exit\\" for his character, which would stay true to him. Geoff departed Summer Bay to \\"follow his dream\\" of becoming a missionary. In 2020, Lewis announced that he wanted to return to Home and Away and pitched a return story for Geoff to producers. However, they did not develop Lewis' idea further. Storylines Geoff and his sister, Annie, find Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) sleeping in their barn and Geoff drives her back to Summer Bay. While they are at the Diner, Annie and Geoff meet Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Annie tells Sally that she and Geoff do not go to school and they work on the farm. When Geoff witnesses Lucas Holden (Rhys Wakefield) sinking a boat, he tells Lucas's father Tony (Jon Sivewright), causing them to become enemies. Bruce sends Geoff and Annie to school when their parents will is found and they learn money was set aside for their education. Geoff joins the local rugby league football team, where he clashes with both Lucas and Aden Jefferies, who believe Tony favours him. Aden spikes Geoff's drink and puts him in the boot of Tony's car. Geoff is rescued the next day and Bruce forces him to leave the team. Bruce kicks Geoff out when he learns that he poisoned the sheep. Geoff moves in with Tony and he rescues Annie, who goes to stay with Irene Roberts. Eventually the siblings are reconciled with Bruce, who even comes to watch Geoff's football match. Bruce later collapses and dies. His will asks Michael Abraham (James Mitchell) to become Geoff and Annie's legal guardian. However, when the farm is repossessed, Annie and Geoff move in with Irene. Geoff is offered a football scholarship and he leaves the Bay. He returns when he learns Reverend Hall (Paul Tassone) has fallen ill and tells Annie that he does not want to play football anymore, he wants to be a Minister instead. Geoff develops a crush on a fellow student, but when he asks her to a bible class, she turns him down. Geoff then asks Melody Jones out and they begin dating. Nicole Franklin tries to cause problems by suggesting to Geoff that Melody did not like their first kiss. Melody's mother, Christine (Elizabeth Alexander), disapproves of the relationship and takes out a restraining order against Geoff, causing him to break up with Melody. Geoff becomes jealous when Nicole dates Elliot Gillen. He joins the couple on a dive boat and is suspicious when Nicole does not surface following a dive. Geoff and Elliot fight and Elliot shoots him in the leg with spear gun. Geoff and Nicole are washed up on an island and they have sex together, before they were rescued. Geoff feels guilty for having sex before marriage and proposes to Nicole, who turns him down. Their relationship starts to crumble and despite a romantic trip back to the island, they break up. Martha buys the farm and hires Geoff's old school friend, Claudia Hammond, to help out. Geoff and Claudia have sex in a caravan, which later catches alight. Geoff rescues Claudia and at the hospital he is punched by her on-off boyfriend, Lachie. Claudia discovers she is pregnant and tells Geoff that he is the father. However, she later admits that Lachie is the father and leaves town. Aden asks Geoff to throw a football game, but Geoff refuses. He and Nicole later find Aden beaten up on the beach. Geoff is saddened when his friend, Belle Taylor, dies and he skips town with Ruby Buckton. He returns a week later and drops out of school to work on Irene's prawn trawler with Aden. Geoff and Aden fight after the trawler's engine overheats. When Aden nearly drowns, Geoff rescues him and they call a truce. Geoff develops feelings for Ruby and they begin dating. When a race riot breaks out, Geoff helps save people and fights the fires. Geoff is injured while protecting Ruby and he is left with permanent scarring. Geoff finds it hard to cope and breaks up with Ruby. He admits to Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) that he has lost his way, before realising that he wants to a take a job as a missionary overseas. After saying goodbye to Irene and Ruby, Geoff leaves for the city. Reception For his portrayal of Geoff, Lewis won the Most Popular New Male Talent Logie Award in 2008. He also earned nominations for Best Newcomer and Sexiest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. A writer for Holy Soap named the character's most memorable moment as \\"evading psycho Derrek\\" who tried to kill him and Nicole. The writer also opined that \\"Hunky Geoff is loved by the ladies\\". A reporter for the Daily Record stated \\"Geoff is lovely but sometimes the sweetness pushes all the sense out of his brain and onto the floor with a big splat. When it comes to the fairer sex, it's not so much a splat as a landslide.\\" The reporter thought Geoff had been \\"goggle-eyed\\" over Nicole and called him a \\"Bible-bashing blond\\".

Facts  The plaintiff claimed transfer of a piece of land, alleging that the defendant had purchased from him another piece of land, and that both pieces had been transferred to the defendant in error. The defendant pleaded that both pieces of land had been purchased by him and that, in any event, he was unable to transfer the former piece as it had since been sold and transferred to a third party. The trial court found that only the one piece of land had been sold to the defendant; that when defendant sold the other piece he knew that it had been transferred to him in error; and that, consequently, he was liable for the value of the land, which the court fixed at ¬£1,250, and damages in the sum of ¬£135. The defendant appealed and the plaintiff cross-appealed against the valuation placed on the property.  Judgment  The court held that, inasmuch as the contract for the sale of the land had been reduced to writing in a broker's note signed by the parties, and inasmuch as the description of the land therein was unambiguous, evidence was not admissible of prior discussions and correspondence to show that what was in fact sold was both pieces of land. The court held further, on the facts, that the plaintiff had furnished an acceptable explanation of how the mistake in the transfer had arisen. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew throughout that he had bought only the one piece of land. As his claim was a conidictio indebiti, he was entitled to the property upon proof that there was no legal or natural obligation to give transfer, and that transfer had been made by mistake‚Äîunless the defendant proved that he had sold it under the bona fide belief that it was due to him, in which case he nevertheless would have to account for the price which he had received. The court held on the facts that the defendant had not discharged the onus of proving that he had sold the property bona fide and that, consequently, he was liable for the value of the land, whose true value was ¬£1,700. The cross appeal thus succeeded, and the decision of the Cape Provincial Division in Hammen v Le Riche was in part confirmed and in part reversed.  References  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al.

Background  Angelo Mongiovi was born in Newark, New Jersey, the first of six children. As a child, he eagerly played in the streets with neighborhood children, but he contracted polio just months before Jonas Salk introduced the polio vaccine. He was sent to a school for children with physical and mental handicaps until his family moved as he was entering sixth grade. Now in Clark, NJ, he was mainstreamed into the general education setting, where he thrived, quickly catching up to his peers. While in Clark, he also tried baseball and basketball for the first time. During his senior year of college, 1973, Mongiovi was working late on a school project and eating in the campus cafeteria when he was approached by Jimmy Marzanno, a double amputee, visiting NCE. Marzanno asked him whether he had ever heard of wheelchair sports; he had not. Marzanno invited Mongiovi to check out a wheelchair basketball practice at Montclair State University. On October 5, 1973, Mongiovi, accompanied by his also-disabled friend Thomas McDonald, was first exposed to the world of wheelchair sports. After borrowing a wheelchair from another friend, the two traveled to Montclair and had their first experience of wheelchair sports. Both would later go on to achieve high honors in their sports of choice: Mongiovi in rugby, basketball and track, and McDonald in weight lifting. At their first practice, Mongiovi was approached by Michael Lione, a player for the New Jersey Blue Devils Wheelchair Basketball Team (and former classmate at the Branch Brook School) and was invited to try out for the team.  Basketball  Although he had very little experience at maneuvering a wheelchair, Mongiovi had a natural talent for wheelchair sports. After seeing his speed on the basketball court, a woman recruiting for the wheelchair track team invited him to try out. In 1989 Mongiovi was chosen to represent the United States in the Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, an international wheelchair sports competition. The United States basketball team came in second place that year, losing to the Canadian team.  Track and field  During his career competing nationally and internationally in wheelchair track and field competitions, Mongiovi participated in many events, including the 100 yard dash, 220 and 440 yard, 200 meter, and slalom races. In 1985, he participated in a national competition racing in the 200 meter dash and setting the national record for fastest time in that race. Upon setting his record, Mongiovi was invited to represent the United States once again in the Stoke Mandeville Games, this time for track, where he competed on a track that was once shared with \\"the fastest man alive,\\" Carl Lewis. He won silver and bronze medals in all of his races at this competition. In 1990, Mongiovi was presented with a national track and field award. He was named the most outstanding slalom competitor overall, beating out one of the best slalom players in the country and one of his role models, Randy Snow.  Rugby  Mongiovi was introduced to wheelchair rugby at the 1989 Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games. It was not until the end of the season in 1991, however, that he was recruited by Angelo Nicosia, an EPVA Coach, and Peter Zarba, a player on the team, to come out and play. He tried out and played his first season between 1991 and 1992 at 39 years of age. It was evident even at the beginning that he possessed a natural talent, which may have been contributed to by his previous wheelchair athletic experience. Mongiovi soon began winning awards, and gained sponsorship from Sunrise Medical, manufacturer of the Quickie wheelchair line, during his first season of play. In 1992, his rugby team, the New York Strykers, competed in the national championships in San Jose, CA where they achieved sixth place and, despite this, Mongiovi was named the Most Valuable Player during his rookie season for the United States. Sports 'n Spokes, a publication about wheelchair athletics, featured a photo of Mongiovi on its cover in 1993 and referred to \\"the marvelous play of Mongiovi\\" in an article about his team. In 1994, he was asked for the third time to represent the United States in the Stoke Mandeville Games, this time as a rugby player. The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal against Great Britain in the championship game with a score of 27-23. His 1995 season was his last year of international competition in wheelchair sports. Mongiovi was selected to represent the United States in the first ever Wheelchair Rugby World Championship in Notwil, Switzerland in 1995. He was selected by his teammates as one of their co-captains, and went on to win the world championship against Canada and earn the first ever wheelchair rugby international gold medal. Mongiovi retired from quad sports in 2000.  Personal life  Mongiovi met Fiona De Louw, a referee from the Netherlands, at the 1995 Wheelchair Rugby World Championships. They later married.

History Blandtown was named for Felix Bland. Born a slave, he was willed land by his former owner, Mrs. Viney Bland.

Influences Mauritius has strong ties with French culture, evidenced by the popularity of French dishes like bouillon, tuna salad, daube, civet de li√®vre and coq au vin served with good wine. As years passed by, some have been adapted to the more exotic ingredients of the island to confer some unique flavor. One of the most prominent chefs in Mauritian cuisine was Madeleine Philippe, whose book Best of Mauritian Cuisine won the World Gourmand Cookbook \\"Best in the World\\" awards in 2018. Origins During the nineteenth century, after the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius brought their cuisine with them. Those indentured labourers came from different parts of India, each with their own culinary tradition, depending on the region. Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. Some common preparations are curry, chutney, rougaille (tomato paste that is very popular with fish) and pickles, most of which use local ingredients. The Mauritian versions of those dishes have a local flavour and differ, at times considerably, from the original Indian recipes. The end of the 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the south-eastern part of China. They are largely credited with making rice the staple diet of the island, and making noodles, both steamed and fried, popular. Chinese appetizers such as hakien (local version of the spring roll with a flour batter replacing the traditional rolled wrapping), crispy chicken and crispy squid have become part of the Mauritian folklore. Furthermore, Chinese and other Asian restaurants are present all around the island, and offer a variety of chicken, squid, beef and fish dishes, most typically prepared in black bean sauce or oyster sauce. Mauritian families often consider a dinner at an Asian restaurant as a treat. Sugarcane was first introduced on the island when the Dutch colonised it in 1638. Even then, the propensity of making rum out of sugarcane was strongly recognised. Sugarcane was mainly cultivated for the production of \\"arrack\\", a precursor to rum. Only much later, after almost 60 years, the first proper sugar was produced. Drink Alouda is a delicious cold beverage made with milk, basil seeds and agar-agar jelly which is especially refreshing on a hot summer day. Panacon is a cold beverage prepared in religious ceremonies like cavadee. It is made with tamarind, sugar, lemons and cardamon. Green island is an alcoholic drink manufactured in Mauritius. It is a derivative de Rum. People in Mauritius usually drink this beverage with cold Sprite and a piece of lemon. Rum Rum from Mauritius It was during the French and English administration that sugar production was fully exploited, which considerably contributed to the economical development of the island. It was Pierre Charles Fran√ßois Harel who in 1850 initially proposed the concept of local distillation of rum in Mauritius. In part due to his efforts, Mauritius today houses four distilleries (Grays, Medine, Chamarel and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three. Dodos Mauritius was the only known habitat of the now-extinct dodo bird When it was discovered, the island of Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird, the dodo. Dodos were descendants of a type of pigeon which settled in Mauritius over 4 million years ago. With no predators to attack them, they lost their need and ability to fly. In 1505, the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius. The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade. Weighing up to 50 pounds, the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors. Large numbers of dodos were killed for food. Later, when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony, new species were introduced to the island. Rats, pigs and monkeys ate dodo eggs in the ground nests. The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population. Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius, the once-abundant dodo became a rare bird. The last one was killed in 1681. The dodo is prominently featured as a supporter of the coat of arms of Mauritius.

Betz served as Adolf Hitler's personal co-pilot and Hans Baur's substitute. Betz was present in the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin in late April 1945. On 1 May 1945, Betz took part in the break-out from the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Early on 2 May 1945, Betz was wounded and died while crossing the Weidendammer Bridge which was under heavy fire from Soviet troops.  Biography  Betz was born in Kolbermoor near Rosenheim (Bavaria). He attended college for mechanical engineering in Munich. Betz then trained as a pilot. In 1932, he became a captain and flew European routes for Lufthansa. He joined the SS and was transferred to the staff of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Betz was appointed captain of the reserve aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel des F√ºhrers. Betz served as Hitler's personal co-pilot and Hans Baur's substitute. Betz was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer on 30 January 1944. He further held the rank of Oberstleutnant der Reserve in the Luftwaffe. = Berlin = Betz was in Berlin during the month of April 1945. Betz had been placed in charge of a small fleet of aircraft at the Tempelhof Airport; making sure the planes were flight ready. Further, he was tasked with making a list of staff personnel to be flown out of Berlin to Obersalzberg, after Hitler gave the word to do so. Hitler on 20 April ordered Albert Bormann, Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, Dr. Theodor Morell, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, secretaries Johanna Wolf, Christa Schroeder, and several others to leave Berlin by aircraft for the Obersalzberg. The group flew out of Berlin on different flights by aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel des F√ºhrers over the following three days. Thereafter, Betz was in charge of overseeing the construction of an emergency air strip near the Brandenburg Gate for use by the F√ºhrerbunker personnel. On 29 April 1945, the Soviet Red Army launched an all-out attack on the centre of Berlin. The Soviet artillery opened up with intense fire in and around the Reich Chancellery area. That evening in the bunker complex below the Chancellery garden, Betz was present with Baur when Hitler said his farewell to his personal pilots. Baur pleaded with Hitler to leave Berlin. The men volunteered to fly Hitler out of Germany in a Ju 390 and to safety. It was all in vain as Hitler turned Baur down, stating he had to stay in Berlin. By the following day, 30 April, the Red Army was less than 500 metres from the F√ºhrerbunker. That afternoon, Betz was still present in the bunker complex during the time when Hitler committed suicide. In one of Hitler's last orders, he had given permission for the Berlin forces to attempt a breakout of the Soviet encirclement after his death. General Helmuth Weidling, commander of the Berlin Defence Area, and SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke, the (Kommandant) Battle Commander for the centre government district, devised a plan to escape out from Berlin to the Allies on the western side of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Mohnke split up the Reich Chancellery and F√ºhrerbunker soldiers and personnel into ten main groups. Betz left the Reich Chancellery as part of one of the groups attempting to break out. After midnight on 2 May 1945, Betz was part of a large group of German soldiers and civilians who crossed the Weidendammer Bridge while under heavy fire from Soviet tanks and guns. Betz was wounded during the crossing. According to Erich Kempka, he came across the badly wounded Betz and left him in the care of Kaethe Hausermann, a dental assistant who had been on Hitler's staff working with Dr. Hugo Blaschke. Kempka went on to state that he learned that Betz died from his injuries a short time thereafter. Other sources only state that Betz died from his wounds received in the area of the Weidendammer bridge. Betz was age 42.

Despite their relatively short career, the band was one of the most successful groups in their native country during the era. They were the first Peruvian band to have their own radio and television program, and made numerous media appearances throughout their career. They wrote many of their own songs in Spanish and had a visceral style, with vocalist Pablo Luna noted for moving frenetically during performances.Wood, Randall.

August 28, 2007 http://www.garagehangover.com/yorks/ In 1964, guitarist, Roman Palacios met drummer, Fred Aguilar, and conceived the idea of forming a band. They named the band after New York City, to honor its musical influence. Subsequently, Walter Paz joined the group on guitar. They then went on to audition vocalists. One morning at the Tauro Theater, Palacios and Aguilar saw Pablo Luna sing for a media reception. His electrifying performance drew their attention, so, they invited him to rehearse with them. The band, who were all fans of \\"Los Saicos,\\" played a few songs that well-known group. Luna joined the lineup. =Success= The band's first single, \\"Abrazame,\\" was released on the MAG label in March 1967 and sold over 40,000 copies, an unusual case for that label. Later, for a brief period, Pablo Luna would not participate in the recordings. During this time, he was replaced by Enrique Palacios. The Yorks released their first LP, \\"Yorks' 67\\" on MAG. During the recording of this album, Miguel Quiroz played in place of Walter Paz. This is the album which catapulted them to national fame. The stations of the time programmed their songs allow them to be even better known in Lima and provinces. Songs such as \\"Abrazame\\", \\"Vete al infierno,\\" among others, received the Golden Disk. They would share the stage with other contemporary bands such as \\"The Doltons\\", \\"The Shains\\" among others. For the recording of this album, Fernando Quiroz participated in place of Walter Paz. Fernando participated in most of the songs and the second guitar of other songs. Because of their newfound fame, they came to have their own TV and radio program, called \\"El show de Los York's\\" on channel 11. In 1968 they released their second LP, \\"York's 68,\\" which consolidated their place in the national rock scene. The additional fame allowed their label to offer more time and budgetary resources for the next LP, Yorks' 68. Some recorded tracks on the album featured the voice of Pablo Villanueva (better known in Peru as \\"Melcochita\\" tropical comedian and musician), who had played certain instruments and participated in some of the backing vocals and harmonies on the first LP. Despite the success of their records, the band did not enjoy an easy relationship with the MAG label. After a quarrel with the label's executives, they made arrangements to switch over to the El Virrey label. Unfortunately, MAG was not willing to dispense with Los Yorks, so they would have to finish out their contract first. The last album they would release on MAG was titled Yorks' 69, was a hodgepodge affair, hastily assembled by MAG, which the band regarded as an illegitimate and apocryphal release. Their next album, Rhythm and Feeling, appeared on El Virrey. The Yorks finished mixing and editing their last LP, \\"York's, Rhythm and Feeling\\" which featured songs the songs \\"I Love You\\", \\"Easy Baby\\", \\"Suzie Q,\\" among others. In the production of this album, they chose a dozen songs ranging from traditional to new wave of protest. In March 1971, just when the band enjoyed great popularity, pressure from the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado began to criticize the style of the band \\"immoral\\" and \\"inciting\\". In 1974, the band broke up.Deming, Mark. \\"Los Yorks: Artist Biography.\\" Allmusic. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/los-yorks- mn0001881774/biography  Discography  = Singles = * \\"Abrazame\\" (Palacios-Aguilar) (MAG, 1967) * \\"Vete al infierno\\" (Palacios-Aguilar) (MAG, 1967) = Albums = * Los York's 67 (MAG, 1967) * Los York's 68 (MAG, 1968) * Los York's 69 (MAG, 1969) * Ritmo y sentimiento (El Virrey, 1970) = Compilation = * El Viaje 1966-1974 (Munster Records, 2008) = Video = Video made with the review of the album THE Yorks - The Journey: 1966-1974, edited by Munster Records, Spain.

Its last was assigned to the 479th Fighter Group, stationed at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 2 August 1991. History =World War II= Activated on 15 October 1943 at Grand Central Air Terminal, near Long Beach, California. Equipped with the Lockheed P-38F Lightning, trained for combat and served as an air defense organization for the west coast as part of IV Fighter Command. Even though the defense of the US west coast initially took priority, it was decided to deploy Lightning squadrons to Britain for heavy bomber escort duty. The squadron was reassigned to RAF Wattisham, England, April‚ÄìMay 1944, and assigned to VIII Fighter Command, Eighth Air Force. From England, the squadron escorted heavy bombers during operations against targets on the Continent, strafed targets of opportunity, and flew fighter-bomber, counter- air, and area-patrol missions. Engaged primarily in B-17/B-24 escort activities and fighter sweeps until the Normandy invasion in June 1944. Patrolled the beachhead during the invasion. Strafed and dive-bombed troops, bridges, locomotives, railway cars, barges, vehicles, airfields, gun emplacements, flak towers, ammunition dumps, power stations, and radar sites while on escort or fighter-bomber missions as the Allies drove across France during the summer and fall of 1944. The unit flew area patrols to support the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July and the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. The unit continued escort and fighter-bomber activities from October to mid-December 1944. It converted to P-51s between 10 September and 1 October, using both types on missions until conversion was completed. Participated in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945) by escorting bombers to and from targets in the battle area and by strafing transportation targets while on escort duty. From February to April 1945 it continued to fly escort missions, but also provided area patrols to support the airborne attack across the Rhine in March. Returned to Camp Kilmer New Jersey in November 1945, and was inactivated on December 1945. =Cold War= F-100A-10-NA 53-1562 Lockheed F-104C-5-LO Starfighter 57-926 about 1960. On 1 December 1952 the unit was reactivated at George AFB, California. Inheriting F-51D Mustangs from the federalized Air National Guard units. In February 1953 upgrading to the North American F-86H Sabre jet aircraft. Was one of the first USAF wings to be equipped with the North American F-100A Super Sabre, receiving its first aircraft in November 1953. Became operationally ready with the F-100A on 29 September 1954. Since the F-100A was not considered as a truly effective air superiority fighter, the service life of the type with the USAF was rather brief, most aircraft being phased out of the active USAF inventory beginning in 1958. Beginning in October 1958, was reequipped with the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. The Starfighter was primarily intended for a nuclear strike, but Tactical Air Command wanted to use it to carry out ground attack missions with conventional weapons. However the F-104 was not really well-suited to USAF needs, being deficient in range, endurance, and offensive capability. In addition, it lacked true all-weather capability. The excellent flying weather in Southern California gave the squadron a new mission to train F-104 pilots from West Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Italy during January 1962 ‚Äì August 1963 as a result of the large foreign sales. Deployed to Kung Kuan Air Base, Taiwan. From its base in Taiwan, the squadron began a regular rotation to Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam where its mission was to fly MiG combat air patrol (MiGCAP) missions to protect USAF F-100 fighter bombers against attack by North Vietnamese fighters. The effect of F-104 deployment upon NVN and PRC MiG operations was immediate and dramatic. NVN MiGs soon learned to avoid contact with USAF strikes being covered by the F-104s. During the entire deployment of the 436th only two fleeting encounters between F-104Cs and enemy fighters occurred. As the MiG threat abated, the 436th TFS was tasked with some weather reconnaissance and ground attack missions. A few of these were against targets in North Vietnam, but most of them were close air-support missions against targets in the South under forward air controller direction. The F-104s were fairly successful in this role, gaining a reputation for accuracy in their cannon fire and their bombing and capable of quite rapid reaction times in response to requests for air support. During this period, the 436th F-104s maintained an in-commission rate of 94.7%, a testimony both to the quality of 436th maintenance personnel and to the simplicity and maintainability of F-104 systems. However, an F-104 went down during a sortie 100 nm SSW of DaNang on 29 June. The pilot was rescued with minor injuries. The 436th TFS had a bad day on 20 September 1965. F-104C pilot Major Philip E. Smith managed to get lost while flying an EC-121 escort mission over the Gulf of Tonkin. After several equipment failures and incorrect steering commands, he managed to wander over Hainan Island and was shot down by a pair of Chinese MiG-19s (J-6s). He ejected and was taken prisoner. While the rest of the squadron was out looking for Major Smith, two other F-104s had a midair collision while returning to their base. Both pilots ejected and were recovered unharmed. A week later, another F-104C was shot down by enemy AAA, and its pilot was killed. After these four losses, the remnants of the 436th were rotated back to George in November 1965. In December 1965, the wing began transitioning to the F-4 Phantom II with a mission of F-4 replacement pilot training. Was reassigned to the provisional 4531st Tactical Fighter WinG at Homestead AFB, Florida in 1968. Squadron flew air defense missions over south Florida until October 1970 with assets of 560th TFW assigned to squadron until 31 October 1970 and inactivated. Was reactivated at Holloman AFB, 1 January 1977 to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The 436th Flew AT-38B Talons. inactivated on 15 November 1991, with the training mission and aircraft being consolidated under the 586th Flight Training Squadron. =Lineage= * Constituted 436th Fighter Squadron on 12 Oct 1943 : Activated on 15 Oct 1943 : Inactivated on 21 Dec 1945 * Re- designated 436th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 15 Oct 1952 : Activated on 1 Dec 1952 : Re-designated: 436th Fighter-Day Squadron on 15 Feb 1954 : Re- designated: 436th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 Jul 1958 : Inactivated: 8 March 1971 * Re-designated: 436th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, 1 January 1977 : Inactivated 2 August 1991. =Assignments= * 479th Fighter Group, 15 Oct 1943 * VIII Fighter Command, 1‚Äì21 Dec 1945 * 479th Fighter- Bomber (later Fighter-Day) Group, 1 Dec 1952 * 479th Fighter-Day (later Tactical Fighter) Wing, 8 Oct 1957 : Attached: Iceland Air Defense Force 1 December 1952 ‚Äì 27 March 1953 : Attached: 16th Air Force 11 August ‚Äì 11 December 1960 : Attached: 86th Air Division 18 January ‚Äì 12 April 1962 : Attached: 65th Air Division 3 August ‚Äì 17 October 1962 : Attached: 65th Air Division 11 December 1962 ‚Äì 3 April 1963 : Attached: 65th Air Division 15‚Äì30 November 1963 : Attached: 2d Air Division 12 July ‚Äì 12 October 1965 * 4531st Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 July 1968 * 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 October 1970 (not manned or equipped) * 479th Tactical Fighter Wing, 30 October 1970 ‚Äì 8 March 1971 * 479th Tactical Training Wing, 1 January 1977 * 479th Fighter Group, 26 July ‚Äì 2 August 1991 =Stations= * Grand Central Air Terminal, California, 15 Oct 1943 * Palmdale Army Airfield, California, 6 Feb 1944 * Santa Maria Army Airfield, California, 8‚Äì16 Apr 1944 * RAF Wattisham (AAF-377) (9B), England, 15 May 1944 ‚Äì 12 Dec 1945 * Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, 20‚Äì21 Dec 1945 * George AFB, California, 1 Dec 1952 ‚Äì 15 July 1968 : Operated from Keflavik Airport, Iceland, 1 December 1952 ‚Äì 27 March 1953 : Operated from Ramstein AB, West Germany, 16 January ‚Äì 12 April 1962 : Operated from Torrejon AB, Spain, 3 August ‚Äì 17 October 1962 : Operated from Torrejon AB, Spain, 11 December 1962 ‚Äì 3 April 1963 : Operated from Torrejon AB, Spain, 15‚Äì30 November 1963 : Operated from Da Nang AB, South Vietnam, 12 July ‚Äì 12 October 1965 * Homestead AFB, Florida, 15 July 1968 ‚Äì 30 October 1970 * George AFB, California, 30 October 1970 ‚Äì 8 March 1971 * Holloman AFB, New Mexico, 1 January 1977 ‚Äì 2 August 1991 =Aircraft= * P-40 Warhawk, 1943‚Äì1944 * P-38 Lightning, 1944 * P-51D Mustang, 1944‚Äì1945 * F-51D Mustang, 1952‚Äì1953 * F-86 Sabre, 1953‚Äì1955 * F-100 Super Sabre, 1954‚Äì1959 * F-104 Starfighter, 1959‚Äì1970 * T-38 Talon, 1977‚Äì1991 References * External links 0436 Category:Fighter squadrons of the United States Air Force ","title":"436th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron"},{"id":"33738366","text":"Elo is an unincorporated community located in the town of Utica, Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States.

History Jalal ad-Din's first encounter with the Kingdom of Georgia occurred in 1225, when his army inflicted a crushing defeat on the Georgians at Garni, bringing about the end of Georgia's medieval heyday. Next year, Jalal ad-Din marched on to Tbilisi, forcing Queen Rusudan of Georgia and her court into flight. The Georgian forces, left in defense of the capital, put up a fierce resistance, but Jalal's forces eventually broke into the city with the assistance of local Muslims on 9 March 1226. The victorious Khwarezmid soldiers sacked Tbilisi and massacred its Christian population. The anonymous 14th-century Georgian chronicle, conventionally known as the Chronicle of a Hundred Years, laments: \\"Words are powerless to convey the destruction that the enemy brought: tearing infants from their mothers' breasts, they beat their heads against the bridge, watching as their eyes dropped from their skulls...\\". The Muslim historians ibn al-Athir and Nasawi, the latter being Jalal's secretary and biographer, confirm the killings of Christians who did not accept Islam at the sultan's order.Minorsky, Vladimir, \\"Tiflis\\", in: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, p. 756. Brill, .Boyle, J. A. (1968), The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 5, p. 328. Cambridge University Press, . According to the Georgian source, Jalal had the dome of the Sioni Cathedral torn down and replaced it with a throne for himself. At his order the icons of Christ and Virgin Mary were carried out of the cathedral and placed at the bridge over the Mtkvari river in order to force the Christians to step on them. Those who refused to profane the icons and apostatize to Islam were beheaded. Metreveli, Roin (ed., 2008), Kartlis Tskhovreba , p. 541. Artanuji, .

He was an orphan who lived in Baltimore, Maryland, Bel Air, Maryland, and Darlington, Maryland. He is famous still as being a member of the Darlington United Methodist Church and witnessing the great revivals of the late 1890s. The story of his life comes from one of his books, Kilts to Togs: Orphan Adventures (1930). He is also the author of Cher Ami (1926), Rough and Brown, Walls of America (1925), and Roosevelt the Righteous (1925). He also wrote Poems from France in 1920.  Life  Harry Webb Farrington was born on July 14, 1879 in Nassau, Bahamas. He moved to Baltimore, Maryland shortly thereafter. According to one of his best sellers, Kilts to Togs, he moved to Bel Air, Maryland but only lived there for a short time. When he was ten years old, he moved again to a small, quaint little hamlet northeast of Bel Air, to Darlington, Maryland and lived with the Windolphs. He was raised in the Darlington United Methodist Church and was converted during the revivals of 1895 to 1897 under the direction of Elmer Lodia Dutton. He worked at a paper mill in Berkley, Maryland. When the paper mill closed, he decided to move to Singerly, Maryland, which is located near Elkton, Maryland. He attended Dickinson Seminary, which is now Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The college is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. He also graduated from Syracuse University in 1907, and continued his education at Boston University and Harvard University. Farrington served as the athletic director for the French troops during World War I. He later became an ordained a preacher in the Methodist Church, where he served as pastor of the Grace Methodist Church in New York City from 1920 to 1923. He then became the education director in that area for the Methodist Church Welfare League. Due to being paralyzed in an accident, he died on October 27, 1930 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He was buried in the Pine Lawn Cemetery in Long Island, New York.  Hymn Writer  Harry Webb Farrington is known especially as a hymn writer. Some of the 30 hymns that he wrote include Dear Lord, Who Sought at Dawn of Day (1927), O God, Creator, in Whose Hand (1929), I Know Not How That Bethlehem's Babe, and Strong, Righteous Man of Galilee.

It is a compact, thickset white rabbit with spectacle-like black rings around each dark eye. First bred in Hotot-en-Auge, Normandy, France in the early 1900s, the breed spread throughout Europe and into North America by the 1920s. Initially unpopular in the United States, it died out there, and suffered population decline in World War II-era Europe. It began to spread again in the 1960s and 1970s, and was re-imported to the US in 1978. Today it is recognized by the British Rabbit Council and the American Rabbit Breeders Association, but is considered globally endangered, with a listing of \\"threatened\\" status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. Characteristics The Blanc de Hotot is always white, with black bands around the eyes, which by breed registry standards should not be more than wide. These bands give the breed \\"the appearance of fine spectacles around the eye\\". The body type is compact, thickset and somewhat rounded. Dewlaps are sometimes present in Does, but are penalized in showing for bucks. The breed has a wide chest, short neck and well muscled fore- and hind-quarters. Originally the black eye bands were not part of the breed standard, which instead described black eyelashes and gray lower eyelids. The fur has a large number of guard hairs, which create a sheen reminiscent of frost. Bucks weigh and does . The Blanc de Hotot is an active and hardy breed. History Hotot rabbit. The Blanc de Hotot was developed in Hotot-en-Auge, Normandy, France by Eug√©nie Bernhard, a noted rabbit breeder. She bred for the desired white and black coloration on a rabbit suitable for both meat and fur production. Around 1902, Bernhard crossed Vienna White and Checkered Giant rabbits with white Flemish Giants, and by 1912 produced what is recognized as the first Blanc de Hotot rabbit. In 1920, a member of the breed appeared in show for the first time at the Exposition Internationale d'Aviculture in Paris, France, and they were officially recognized as a breed in 1922. In 1921 and 1922, they were first exported to the United States, although the breed was not popular in that country and died out. In 1927, they began to be exported to Switzerland, where they became very popular. In 1930, the German Frederick Joppich began raising Blanc de Hotots, and would come to be called the \\"greatest supporter\\" of the breed. World War II caused major population decreases, almost resulting in extinction for the breed in France, the Netherlands and Germany. Joppich, and many of his rabbits, remained in East Germany when the country was divided following World War II. However, a fellow breeder began to spread the rabbits throughout the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in the 1960s, and by 1970, there were 62 Blanc de Hotots registered in a major show in Stuttgart. Exports to the United States began again in 1978, and in September of that year, the first Blanc de Hotots to be shown in the US were exhibited at the New Mexico State Fair. In 1979, the Blanc de Hotot was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association. In the US, Blanc de Hotots have been crossed with White Beverens, White New Zealands and White Satins to increase the available gene pool. In 2004, additional imports to the US were made from Germany, the Netherlands and England. The Blanc de Hotot is considered globally endangered, and is listed by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy at \\"threatened\\" status, meaning they have a global population of less than 1,000 and less than 100 registrations in the US each year. The Blanc de Hotot is recognized by the British Rabbit Council and the American Rabbit Breeders Association. In Britain, the Blanc de Hotot is grouped with other rare rabbit breeds in the Rare Varieties Club. In the United States, the breeder association is named the Hotot Rabbit Breeders International.

The ideal scenario test is a credible, complex, compelling or motivating story; the outcome of which is easy to evaluate. These tests are usually different from test cases in that test cases are single steps whereas scenarios cover a number of steps. History Cem Kaner coined the phrase scenario test by October 2003. He commented that one of the most difficult aspects of testing was maintaining step-by-step test cases along with their expected results. His paper attempted to find a way to reduce the re-work of complicated written tests and incorporate the ease of use cases. A few months later, Hans Buwalda wrote about a similar approach he had been using that he called \\"soap opera testing\\". Like television soap operas these tests were both exaggerated in activity and condensed in time. The key to both approaches was to avoid step-by-step testing instructions with expected results and instead replaced them with a narrative that gave freedom to the tester while confining the scope of the test.  Methods  = System scenarios = In this method only those sets of realistic, user activities that cover several components in the system are used as scenario tests.

The times it takes for a radio signal to travel from the stations to the receiver are unknown, but the time differences are known. That is, {\\\\displaystyle t_{A},t_{B},t_{C}} are unknown, but {\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{B}} and {\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{C}} are known. Then, each time difference locates the receiver on a branch of a hyperbola focused on the ground stations. The receiver is then located at one of the two intersections. Other navigation information can be used to determine at which intersection the receiver is located. Hyperbolic navigation is a class of obsolete radio navigation systems in which a navigation receiver instrument on a ship or aircraft is used to determine location based on the difference in timing of radio waves received from fixed land-based radio navigation beacon transmitters. Measuring the difference in timing (phase) of radio signals received from two beacons gives the difference in distance of the receiver from the beacons. Plotting all of the potential locations of the receiver for the measured delay localizes the receiver to a hyperbolic line on a chart. Taking timing measurements from two pairs of beacons gives two such hyperbolic lines, and the receiver's location is at the intersection of the lines. The two lines may intersect in two points, in which case other navigation information is used to determine which point is the receiver's location. Hyperbolic location systems were first used during World War I in acoustic location systems for locating enemy artillery. The sound of a shell being fired was received by several microphones, and the time of reception sent to a computing center to plot the location. These systems were used into World War II. The first hyperbolic radio navigation system was the World War II-era Gee, introduced by the Royal Air Force for use by RAF Bomber Command. This was followed by the Decca Navigator System in 1944 by the Royal Navy, along with LORAN by the US Navy for long-range navigation at sea. Post war examples including the well-known US Coast Guard LORAN-C, the international Omega system, and the Soviet Alpha and CHAYKA. All of these systems saw use until their wholesale replacement by satellite navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1990s. Basic concepts =Timing-based navigation= Consider two ground-based radio stations located at a set distance from each other, say 300 km so that they are exactly 1 ms apart at light speed. Both stations are equipped with identical transmitters set to broadcast a short pulse at a specific frequency. One of these stations, called the \\"secondary\\" is also equipped with a radio receiver. When this receiver hears the signal from the other station, referred to as the \\"master\\", it triggers its own broadcast. The master station can then broadcast any series of pulses, with the secondary hearing these and generating the same series after a 1 ms delay. Consider a portable receiver located on the midpoint of the line drawn between the two stations, known as the baseline. In this case, the signals will, necessarily, take 0.5 ms to reach the receiver. By measuring this time, they could determine that they are precisely 150 km from both stations, and thereby exactly determine their location. If the receiver moves to another location along the line, the timing of the signals would change. For instance, if they time the signals at 0.25 and 0.75 ms, they are 75 km from the closer station and 225 from the further. If the receiver moves to the side of the baseline, the delay from both stations will grow. At some point, for instance, they will measure a delay of 1 and 1.5 ms, which implies the receiver is 300 km from one station and 450 from the other. If one draws circles of 300 and 450 km radius around the two stations on a chart, the circles will intersect at two points. With any additional source of navigation information, one of these two intersections can be eliminated as a possibility, and thus reveal their exact location, or \\"fix\\". =Absolute vs. differential timing= There is a serious practical problem with this approach - in order to measure the time it took for the signals to reach the receiver, the receiver must know the precise time that the signal was originally sent. This is not possible in the case of uncooperative signal sources (like enemy artillery) and even in modern times, GPS receivers with atomic clocks synchronized to the spacecraft are very rare. In the 1930s, such precise time measurements simply weren't possible; a clock of the required accuracy was difficult enough to build in fixed form, let alone portable. A high-quality crystal oscillator, for instance, drifts about 1 to 2 seconds in a month, or .\\"Clock accuracy in ppm\\" This may sound small, but as light travels , this represents a drift of 400 m per hour. Only a few hours of flight time would render such a system unusable, a situation that remained in force until the introduction of commercial atomic clocks in the 1960s. However, it is possible to accurately measure the difference between two signals. Much of the development of suitable equipment had been carried out between 1935 and 1938 as part of the efforts to deploy radar systems. The UK, in particular, had invested considerable effort in the development of their Chain Home system. The radar display systems for Chain Home were based on oscilloscopes (or oscillographs as they were known at time) triggered to start their sweep when the broadcast signal was sent. Return signals were amplified and sent into the 'scope display, producing a \\"blip\\". By measuring the distance along the face of the oscilloscope of any blips, the time between broadcast and reception could be measured, thus revealing the range to the target. With very slight modification, the same display could be used to time the difference between two arbitrary signals. For navigational use, any number of identifying characteristics could be used to differentiate the master from the secondary signals. In this case, the portable receiver triggered its trace when it received the master signal. As the signals from secondary arrived they would cause a blip on the display in the same fashion as a target on the radar, and the exact delay between the master and secondary easily determined. =Hyperbolic navigation= Consider the same examples as our original absolute-timed cases. If the receiver is located on the midpoint of the baseline the two signals will be received at exactly the same time, so the delay between them will be zero. However, the delay will be zero not only if they are located 150 km from both stations and thus in the middle of the baseline, but also if they are located 200 km from both stations, and 300 km, and so forth. So in this case the receiver cannot determine their exact location, only that their location lies somewhere along a line perpendicular to the baseline. In the second example the receivers determined the timing to be 0.25 and 0.75 ms, so this would produce a measured delay of 0.5 ms. There are many locations that can produce this difference - 0.25 and 0.75 ms, but also 0.3 and 0.8 ms, 0.5 and 1 ms, etc. If all of these possible locations are plotted, they form a hyperbolic curve centred on the baseline. Navigational charts can be drawn with the curves for selected delays, say every 0.1 ms. The operator can then determine which of these lines they lie on by measuring the delay and looking at the chart. A single measurement reveals a range of possible locations, not a single fix. The solution to this problem is to simply add another secondary station at some other location. In this case two delays will be measured, one the difference between the master and secondary \\"A\\", and the other between the master and secondary \\"B\\". By looking up both delay curves on the chart, two intersections will be found, and one of these can be selected as the likely location of the receiver. This is a similar determination as in the case with direct timing/distance measurements, but the hyperbolic system consists of nothing more than a conventional radio receiver hooked to an oscilloscope. Because a secondary could not instantaneously transmit its signal pulse on receipt of the master signal, a fixed delay was built into the signal. No matter what delay is selected, there will be some locations where the signal from two secondary would be received at the same time, and thus make them difficult to see on the display. Some method of identifying one secondary from another was needed. Common methods included transmitting from the secondary only at certain times, using different frequencies, adjusting the envelope of the burst of signal, or broadcasting several bursts in a particular pattern. A set of stations, master and secondaries, was known as a \\"chain\\". Similar methods are used to identify chains in the case where more than one chain may be received in a given location. Operational systems Meint Harms was the first to have attempted the construction of a hyperbolic navigation systems, starting with musings on the topic in 1931 as part of his master's examination at Seefahrtschule L√ºbeck (Navigation College). After taking the position of Professor for Mathematics, Physics and Navigation at the Kaisertor in L√ºbeck, Harms tried to demonstrate hyperbolic navigation making use of simple transmitters and receivers. On 18 February 1932 he received Reichspatent-Nr. 546000 for his invention.Festschrift 175 Jahre Seefahrtschule L√ºbeckMeldau-Steppes, Lehrbuch der Navigation, B.2, page 7.142, Bremen 1958 =Gee= The first operational hyperbolic navigation was UK's Gee, first used experimentally by RAF Bomber Command in 1941. Gee was used both for bombing over Germany as well as navigation in the area of the UK, especially for landing at night. Several Gee chains were built in the UK, and after the war this expanded for four chains in the UK, two in France, and one in northern Germany. For a period following the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization in 1946, Gee was considered as the basis for a worldwide standard for navigation, but the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) system was selected instead, and the last Gee chain was eventually shut down in 1970.Jerry Proc, \\"The GEE system\\", 14 January 2001 Gee signals from a given chain were all sent on a single frequency. The master station sent two signals, the \\"A\\" signal that marked the beginning of a timing period, and the \\"D\\" signal which was essentially two \\"A\\"s to mark the end. In every period, one of the two secondaries would respond, alternating their \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" signals. The resulting pattern was \\"ABD‚Ä¶ACD‚Ä¶ABD‚Ä¶\\" A wide-band receiver was used to tune in chain and the output set to the operator's oscilloscope. As the stations were closely spaced in frequency, this sometimes resulted in the signals from several stations appearing on the display. To distinguish the chains in these cases, a second \\"A\\" signal, the \\"A1\\" or \\"ghost A\\", was sometimes keyed in, and the pattern of flashing on the display could be used to identify the chain. The operator initially tuned in their receiver to see a stream of pulses on the display, sometimes including those of other chains which were nearby in frequency. He would then tune a local oscillator that started the trigger of the oscilloscope's trace so that it matched the clock at the master station (which could, and did, change over time). Next he would use a variable delay to move the start of the signal so one of the \\"A\\" pulses was at the very left side of the 'scope (the action is identical to the \\"horizontal hold\\" dial on an analog television). Finally the speed of the trace across the display would be tuned so the D pulse was just visible on the right. The distance of the B or C pulse from the A pulse could now be measured with an attached scale. The resulting delays could then be looked up on a navigational chart. The display was relatively small, which limited resolution, and thus the determination of the delay. A measurement accuracy of 1 microsecond was quoted, which resulted in an accuracy of the determination of the correct hyperbolic to about 150 meters, and when two such measurements were combined the resulting fix accuracy was around 210 m. At longer ranges, 350 miles for example, the error ellipse was about 6 miles by 1 mile. The maximum range was about 450 miles, although several long-range fixes were made under unusual circumstances. =LORAN= The US had also considered hyperbolic navigation as early as 1940, and started a development effort known as Project 3 that was similar to Gee. Only halting progress had been made by the time they were introduced to Gee, which was already entering production. Gee was immediately selected for the 8th Air Force and the Project 3 team turned their attention to other uses, eventually considering convoy navigation in particular. The new concept relied on the use of skywaves to allow the pulses to be received over very long ranges. This produced considerably more complex received signals than with Gee's line-of-sight system, and was more difficult to interpret. With that exception, however, the two systems were very similar in concept, and differed largely in frequency selections and the details of the pulse timing. Robert J. Dippy, inventor of Gee, moved to the US in mid-1942 to help with details of the ground stations. During this time he demanded that an airborne version of the receivers be made, and should be interchangeable with Gee. The resulting system emerged as LORAN, for LOng RAnge Navigation, and the first chain of two stations went live on June 1942.Jerry Proc, \\"LORAN-A\\", 26 November 2007 LORAN became LORAN-A when the design of its replacement started, this was initially the LORAN-B concept, but eventually replaced by the very long-range LORAN-C starting in 1957. LORAN eventually selected 1.950 MHz as its primary operating frequency. 7.5 MHz was selected for daytime use as an additional channel, but never used operationally. In comparison to Gee's range through air, LORAN had a range of about over water, and over land. Operation was generally similar to Gee, but only one of the secondary signals was displayed at a time. A fix required the operator to measure one delay, then the other, and then look up the resulting delays on the charts. This was a time-consuming process that could take several minutes. The accuracy was quoted as 1% of range. LORAN used two methods to identify a chain. One was the operational frequency, with four \\"channels\\", as in Gee. The second was the rate at which the pulses were repeated, with \\"high\\", \\"low\\" and \\"slow\\" rates. This allowed for up to 12 chains in any given area. Additionally, the originally steady repetition of the pulses was later modified to create another eight unique patterns, allowing a total of 96 station pairs. Any given chain could use one or more pairs of stations, demanding a large number of unique signals for widespread coverage. =Decca Navigator= The Decca Navigation System was originally developed in the US, but eventually deployed by the Decca Radio company in the UK and commonly referred to as a British system. Initially developed for the Royal Navy as an accurate adjunct to naval versions of Gee, Decca was first used on 5 June 1944 to guide minesweepers in preparation for the D-Day invasions. The system was developed post-war and competed with GEE and other systems for civilian use. A variety of reasons, notably its ease-of-use, kept it in widespread use into the 1990s, with a total 42 chains around the world. A number of stations were updated in the 1990s, but the widespread use of GPS led to Decca being turned off at midnight on 31 March 2000.Jerry Proc, \\"Decca Navigator - History\\", 14 January 2008 Decca was based on comparing the phases of continuous signals instead of the timing of their pulses. This was more accurate, as the phase of a pair of signals could be measured to within a few degrees, four degrees in the case of Decca. This greatly improved inherent accuracy allowed Decca to use much longer wavelengths than Gee or LORAN while still offering the same level of accuracy. The use of longer wavelengths gave better propagation than either Gee or LORAN, although ranges were generally limited to around 500 miles for the basic system. Decca also had the inherent disadvantage that the signal could only vary by as much as 360 degrees, and that patterned repeated in a circle around the stations. That meant there were a large number of locations that met any particular phase measurement, a problem known as \\"phase ambiguity\\". Whereas Gee fixed you to one of two locations, Decca fixed you to one of hundreds. Decca solved this problem though the use of an odometer-like display known as \\"decometers\\". Prior to leaving on a trip, the navigator would set the decometer's lane counter to their known position. As the craft moved the dial's hand would rotate, and increment or decrement the counter when it passed zero. The combination of this number and the current dial reading allowed the navigator to directly read the current delay and look it up on a chart, a far easier process than Gee or LORAN. It was so much easier to use that Decca later added an automatic charting feature that formed a moving map display. Later additions to the signal chain allowed the zone and lane to be calculated directly, eliminating the need for manually setting the lane counters and making the system even easier to use. As each master and secondary signal was sent on a different frequency, any number of delays could be measured at the same time; in practice a single master and three secondaries were used to produce three outputs. As each signal was sent on a different frequency, all three, known as \\"green\\", \\"red\\" and \\"purple\\", were simultaneously decoded and displayed on three decometers. The secondaries were physically distributed at 120 degree angles from each other, allowing the operator to pick the pair of signals on the display that were sent from stations as close to right angles to the receiver as possible, further improving accuracy. Maximum accuracy was normally quoted as 200 yards, although that was subject to operational errors. In addition to greater accuracy and ease of use, Decca was also more suitable for use over land. Delays due to refraction can have a significant effect on pulse timing, but much less so for phase changes. Decca thus found itself in great demand for helicopter use, where runway approach aids like ILS and VOR were not suitable for the small airfields and essentially random locations the aircraft were used. One serious disadvantage to Decca was that it was susceptible to noise, especially from lightning. This was not a serious concern for ships, who could afford to wait out storms, but made it unsuitable for long-range air navigation where time was of the essence. Several versions of Decca were introduced for this role, notably DECTRA and DELRAC, but these did not see widespread use.Jerry Proc, \\"DECTRA\\", 20 February 2001Jerry Proc, \\"DELRAC\\", 26 January 2008 =LORAN-C= LORAN-A was designed to be quickly built on the basis of Gee, and selected its operating frequency based on the combination of the need for long over-water range and a selected minimum accuracy. Using much lower frequencies, in the kHz instead of MHz, would greatly extend the range of the system. However, the accuracy of the fix is a function of the wavelength of the signal, which increases at lower frequencies - in other words, using a lower frequency would necessarily lower the accuracy of the system. Hoping for the best, early experiments with \\"LF Loran\\" instead proved that accuracy was far worse than predicted, and efforts along these lines were dropped.Jerry Proc, \\"LORAN-C History\\", 21 March 2004 Several halting low-frequency efforts followed, including the Decca-like Cyclan and Navarho concepts. None of those proved to offer any real advance over Decca; they either offered marginally improved range, or better range but too little accuracy to be useful. Gee and LORAN-A became possible due to the development of the oscilloscope ‚Äì before this the accurate measurement of time was not possible. LORAN-C became possible due to the development of the low-cost phase-locked loop (PLL) in the 1950s. A PLL produces a steady output signal with the same frequency and phase as an input signal, even if that input is periodic or poorly received. In this case the important feature was that the PLL allowed the re-construction of a continuous signal from a number of short pulses. A system using PLLs could receive a single pulsed signal, like Gee, and then re-construct a continuous tone for phase measurement, like Decca. Re- using the Cyclan transmitters, the US Navy started experiments with such a system in the mid-1950s, and turned the system on permanently in 1957. Numerous chains followed, eventually providing around-the-world coverage near US allies and assets. Although less accurate that Decca, it offered the combination of reasonable accuracy and long ranges, a combination that obsoleted almost all other systems then in use and led to their gradual withdrawal. LORAN-C remained in service well into the satellite navigation era, until GPS finally led to its shutdown on 8 February 2010.Jerry Proc, \\"LORAN-C Closure\\", 1 September 2010 In basic operation, LORAN-C is more similar to Decca than Gee or LORAN-A, as its main way determining location was the comparison of phase differences between signals. However, at low frequencies and long ranges it would be difficult to know whether you are looking at the current phase of the signal, or the phase of the signal one cycle ago, or perhaps one reflected off the ionosphere. Some form of secondary information is needed to reduce this ambiguity. LORAN-C achieved this by sending unique details in the pulses so each station could be uniquely identified. The signal was started off when the Master broadcast a sequence of nine pulses, with the precise timing between each pulses being used to identify the station. Each of the Secondary stations then sent out their own signals, consisting of eight pulses in patterns that revealed which station they were. The receivers could use the signal timings to select chains, identify secondaries, and reject signals bounced off the ionosphere.Jerry Proc, \\"LORAN-C Signal Characteristics\\", 24 September 2006 LORAN-C chains were organized into the Master station, M, and up to five Secondary stations, V, W, X, Y, Z. All were broadcast at 100 kHz, a much lower frequency than earlier systems. The result was a signal that offered a daytime ground wave range of 2,250 miles, nighttime ground wave of 1,650 miles and skywaves out to 3,000 miles. Timing accuracy was estimated at 0.15 microseconds, offering accuracies on the order of 50 to 100 meters. In real-world use, the Coast Guard quoted absolute accuracy of 0.25 nautical miles, or better.\\"Special Notice Regarding LORAN Closure\\", US Coast Guard, 8, June 2012 =Omega= One of the last hyperbolic navigation systems to enter operational use was one of the earliest to be developed; Omega traces its history to work by John Alvin Pierce in the 1940s, working on the same basic idea as the Decca phase-comparison system. He imagined a system specifically for medium-accuracy global navigation, and thus selected the extremely low frequency of 10 kHz as the basis for the signal. However, the problem with phase ambiguity, as in the case of Decca, meant that the system was not practical at the time. Where the phase-locked loop made LORAN-C a possibility, for Omega it was the introduction of inertial navigation systems (INS) that offered a solution - the INS was accurate enough to resolve any ambiguity about which lane the receiver was in. Experiments continued throughout the 1950s and 60s, in parallel with Decca's development of their almost identical DELRAC system. It was not until the 1960s, when ice- breaking ballistic submarines became a main deterrent force, that there was a pressing need for such a system. The US Navy authorized full deployment in 1968, reaching a complete set of 8 stations in 1983. Omega would also prove to be one of the shortest-lived systems, shutting down on 20 September 1997.Jerry Proc, \\"OMEGA\\", 21 October 2010 Omega stations broadcast a continuous-wave signal in a specific time-slot. In order to maintain precise timing of the slots for stations distributed around the world, stations were equipped with synchronized atomic clocks. These clocks also ensured that their signals were sent out with the right frequency and phase; unlike previous systems, Omega did not need to have a master/secondary arrangement as the clocks were accurate enough to trigger the signals without an external reference. To start the sequence, the station in Norway would initially broadcast on 10.2 kHz for 0.9 seconds, then turned off for 0.2 seconds, then broadcast on 13.6 kHz for 1.0 seconds, and so on. Each station broadcast a series of four such signals lasting about a second each, and then stood silent while other stations took their turn. At any given instant, three stations would be broadcasting at the same time on different frequencies. Receivers would select the set of stations that were most suitable for their given location, and then wait for the signals for those stations to appear during the 10 second chain. Calculation of the fix then proceeded in precisely the same fashion as Decca, although the much lower operating frequency led to much less accuracy. Omega's charts quote accuracies of 2 to 4 nautical miles. =CHAYKA= CHAYKA is the Soviet Union's counterpart to LORAN-C, and operates on similar principles and the same frequency. It differs primarily in details of the pulse envelopes. There are five CHAYKA chains distributed around the former Soviet Union, each with a master and between two and four secondaries. =Alpha= Alpha, more correctly known by its Soviet name, RSDN-20, is essentially a version of Omega deployed in the former Soviet Union starting in 1962. The initial system used only three transmitters running roughly in a line in Krasnodar, Revda and Novosibirsk, the later being the master station. In 1991 two additional stations came online at Khabarovsk and Seyda. The stations use frequencies between 11 and 14 kHz.Trond Jacobsen, \\"THE RUSSIAN VLF NAVAID SYSTEM, ALPHA, RSDN-20\\" =Satellite navigation systems= Two complicating factors for satnav systems are: (1) the transmitter stations (satellites) are moving; and (2) GPS satellite transmissions are synchronized with UTC (with a published offset), thus providing precise time.

Both aircraft crashed into the lake, killing all 13 people on board. Flight history =North Central Airlines Flight 290= North Central Airlines Flight 290 was a regularly scheduled flight which usually originated in Houghton, Michigan, and stopped at Ironwood, Michigan, and Green Bay, Oshkosh, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before terminating at Chicago, Illinois. On June 29, 1972, bad weather in northern Michigan necessitated cancellation of the Houghton-Ironwood and Ironwood-Green Bay legs, and the flight originated at Green Bay, using a replacement crew sent from Chicago to Green Bay. The flight, a Convair CV-580, departed Green Bay at around 10:30 a.m. CDT, proceeding to Oshkosh under visual flight rules (VFR). At 10:36:11 a.m. CDT, the air traffic controller at Oshkosh cleared Flight 290 to land. The flight crew's acknowledgment five seconds later was the last communication with North Central Flight 290. =Air Wisconsin Flight 671= Air Wisconsin Flight 671 was a regularly scheduled flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Appleton, Wisconsin, with a stopover at Sheboygan County Memorial Airport west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Operating a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, it departed Chicago at 9:28 a.m. CDT on June 29, 1972, bound for Sheboygan under an instrument flight rules (IFR) plan; en route, the flight crew abandoned its IFR plan and completed the first leg of the flight under VFR. The flight departed Sheboygan 13 minutes late, at 10:23 a.m. CDT, bound for Appleton, operating under VFR. At about 10:30 a.m. CDT, the flight crew contacted the Air Wisconsin office in Appleton, stating that they anticipated arriving at Appleton at 10:44 a.m. CDT. This was the last communication with Air Wisconsin Flight 671. Collision Operating in bright sunshine beneath a scattered cloud layer, Flights 290 and 671 collided at 10:36:47 a.m. CDT over Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago about south of Appleton and east of Neenah, Wisconsin, at an altitude of about 2,500 feet (762 m). A mid-air explosion and fire ensued, and both aircraft crashed into the lake. The National Transportation Safety Board noted that the North Central crew would have had to look toward the sun to see the approaching Air Wisconsin plane and concluded that they took no evasive action. Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was . Aircraft The North Central aircraft involved, N50858, had been completed as a Convair CV-340/440 on May 25, 1953; it later was converted to CV-580 standard. The Air Wisconsin Twin Otter had been completed on October 6, 1966. Both aircraft were destroyed by the collision and subsequent water impact. Their wreckage was found on the lake bottom scattered over an area roughly one mile (1.6 km) long by one-half mile (0.8 km) wide. Casualties The North Central plane had two passengers and a crew of three - Captain James Cuzzort, First Officer Alton Laabs, and a flight attendant - on board, while the Air Wisconsin flight was carrying six passengers and a crew of two - Captain David Jacobs and First Officer Michael Gaffin. All 13 people aboard the two planes died in the collision and subsequent crash, and the NTSB observed that the accident was not survivable. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board released its report on the accident on April 25, 1973. It was \\"unable to determine why each crew failed to see and avoid the other aircraft,\\" and concluded that the crash resulted from \\"the failure of both flight crews to detect visually the other aircraft in sufficient time to initiate evasive action,\\" and stated that it believed \\"that the ability of both crews to detect the other aircraft in time to avoid a collision was reduced because of the atmospheric conditions and human visual limitations.\\" The NTSB speculated that both flight crews could have been scanning instruments in preparation for descent to their respective destinations at the time of the collision, and this could have reduced their chances of spotting one another. The report also noted that the decision by both flight crews to fly under VFR rather than IFR and the fact that neither captain requested in-flight advisories deprived both aircraft of air traffic control support, and that such support to even one of the aircraft would have ensured sufficient separation to avoid a collision. The NTSB recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration create a standardized method for training and grading flight crews in visual search techniques and time-sharing between instrument checks and visual searches, and that the FAA expedite the development of anticollision systems.

Background Vantile Emmanuel Whitfield was born on September 8, 1930, in Washington, D.C., the only child of Theodore Roosevelt Whitfield (1902‚Äì1971) and Lugene Ellen Green. While a student at Dunbar High School, he played football and became interested in painting. After high school, he served in the Air Force until 1952. Whitfield studied theatre at Howard University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1957. After graduation, he enrolled in the master's degree program at the UCLA Film School, becoming one of the first African Americans to study there. He was married, to actress Lynn Whitfield, from 1974 to 1978. Career In 1963, Whitfield co-founded with actor Frank Silvera the American Theatre of Being in Los Angeles. While there he taught acting classes with Beah Richards, Whitman Mayo and Isabel Sanford. Also in 1963, Whitfield designed the sets, lights and costumes for Silvera's production of the James Baldwin play The Amen Corner, becoming the first African-American production designer to work on Broadway. The following year, Whitfield founded and served as producing artistic director of the Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles (PASLA). The goal of PASLA was to help train inner-city youth in the performing arts. He was also founding Artistic Director of Studio West and was enlisted by Robert Hooks, of the D.C. Black Repertory Company, to be its Artistic Director. In 1971, Whitfield was the founding director of the Expansion Arts Program at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). In this role, he had perhaps his greatest influence, because this program provided funds for many African- American artists and arts organizations. Association with L.A. Rebellion filmmakers Although his tenure at UCLA Film School pre-dates the period generally associated with the L.A. Rebellion, Whitfield had a connection with several filmmakers associated with the film movement. Larry Clark taught film production classes at PASLA while a student at UCLA and directed the short film As Above, So Below (1973) through the organization. Whitfield also acted in Haile Gerima's film Ashes and Embers. Death Whitfield died from complications of Alzheimer's disease on January 9, 2005.

It is located along the main road passing through the village (Oswaldkirk Main Street),Conservation Area Assessment, pp. 16 east of Ampleforth Abbey. Dedicated to the Christian saint Saint Oswald, it is over 900 years old and administered by the Church of England. It is part of a four-parish benefice, the Benefice of Ampleforth with Oswaldkirk, Gilling East and Stonegrave, in the archdeaconry of Cleveland, and the diocese of York. The church has been a Grade II* listed building since 1955, and is the oldest building in the village by more than six centuries.Conservation Area Assessment, pp. 11 Etymology The word \\"kirk\\" means church, so the village is literally called \\"Oswald's church\\", after the church, which is dedicated to Saint Oswald of Northumbria, a Christian king who spread Christianity throughout Northumbria in the 7th century AD.A Living Village, pp.45 History and architecture Almost nothing of the original church‚Äîbuilt on the site of a wooden Saxon church‚Äîremains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a plait interweave and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a quoin, which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon cross shaft.Conservation Area Assessment, pp. 10 The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re- consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch on the inside of the southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century. The church records include an unbroken list of rectors dating back to 1302, during the reign of King Edward I. One notable rector was John Dee, who served from early 1568 until the year 1574, although he was probably never a permanent resident.A Living Village, pp.74 Dee, a noted mathematician, astrologer, alchemist and astronomer, was on friendly terms with the ruling monarch, Queen Elizabeth I, and had given her astrological advice for setting the date of her coronation. The future Archbishop of Canterbury and chaplain to King Charles II, John Tillotson, preached his first sermon at the church of Saint Oswald in 1661, because of his friendship with John Denton, who was rector of the church from 1658 until his expulsion in 1662 for non-conformism. Perhaps the most important event in the 17th century was the installation of two brand new bells, one bearing the inscription \\"Venite Exultemus Domino\\", or \\"Come, let us rejoice in the Lord\\" (dated 1684), and the other bearing the inscription \\"Gloria in Altissimus Deo\\", or \\"Glory to God in the highest\\" (dated 1683). These are still in use through bell-ropes, which have been replaced several times in the intervening centuries and extend down to the floor next to the clock mechanism, which is dated 1898 and is wholly mechanical, powering a clock whose two faces can be seen on both the western and eastern sides of the bell tower.A Living Village, pp. 46 There was major restoration work done to the church in 1886, and a large amount of the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the stylised form of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font at the other end of the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to the church can be seen in the bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an electric organ during services. The church is a Grade II* listed building and has been so since 4 January 1955. Modern usage St Oswald's is part of a four-church benefice, including the churches and parishes of Oswaldkirk, Ampleforth, Gilling, and Stonegrave. As of 2017 the vicar is the Reverend Dr Catherine Elizabeth Reid, who serves all four parishes. Services in the church occur weekly on Sunday and at other times during the week with the help of volunteers in the local community. There is also a \\"tea time club\\", which is a club teaching Christian morals and biblical teachings to young people, as well as biblical role-plays and \\"mini- pilgrimages\\". The church is host to a carol service each year on Christmas Eve, jointly undertaken by the Anglican congregation and that of Oswaldkirk's Roman Catholic church, the church of Saint Aidan. The united churches of Oswaldkirk also have a harvest festival each year, hosted in the building of Saint Aidan's church every other year, alternating with St Oswald's church.

True to its name, the breed is kept by the Maasai, though both pastoralists and smallholder farmers in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda keep Red Maasai flocks. The breed is a fat-tailed hair sheep, meaning they do not produce wool and are kept primarily for meat. Though less productive than some other breeds raised in East Africa, they are valued for their hardiness in arid conditions and their relatively stronger resistance to internal parasites.  History  Though their exact origin is unclear, Red Maasai sheep are native to Kenya and have long been a part of the farming cultures of the Great Rift Valley. Though traditional Maasai culture does place cattle in higher prominence than small ruminants, many Maasai and smallholders in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have raised the breed. The Red Maasai was the predominate sheep breed among the Maasai and other tribes in Kenya until the 1970s, when subsidies began to support crossbreeding with Dorper sheep and other imported types. Developed in South Africa, Dorpers began to be widely crossbred with native Kenyan stock. Today, fewer purebred Red Maasai sheep remain, and crossbreeds are the majority, making the future of the breed uncertain.  Characteristics  Red Maasai sheep are named for their usual color of red- brown, though they may also be pied. The breed is a hair sheep, meaning it does not produce wool, though it may have a shaggy coat of hair. It is also a fat-tailed sheep breed known for visibly large fat deposits in its tail and hindquarters. Red Maasai are medium-to-large bodied sheep. All of these factors mean the Red Maasai is suited to meat production instead of fiber. Red Maasai sheep are renowned for their resistance to parasite like Haemonchus contortus. In Africa, endoparasites in particular can cause large livestock losses, because smallholder farmers that also raise crops often rely on shared grazing land. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that compared to introduced breeds such as the Dorper, Red Maasai are significantly more resistant to parasites. This resistance is potentially of great value to other sheep operations due to the significant financial losses caused by parasites in other sheep-producing regions. Consequently, scientists have focused on attempting to identify the genes responsible for internal parasite resistance in Red Maasai sheep.

It was a spin-off from National Lampoon magazine. The book was a parody of a high school yearbook from the early 1960s. It was edited by P. J. O'Rourke and Doug Kenney and art-directed by David Kaestle. Much of the writing was by P. J. O'Rourke and Doug Kenney. The \\"literary magazine\\" was written by Sean Kelly; the sports page was by Christopher Cerf; and the Principal's Letter and the \\"In Memorium\\" piece were both by Ed Subitzky. The book, as it was originally published, appeared to be a genuine 1964 yearbook from \\"C. Estes Kefauver High School\\": the Kefauver Kaleidoscope. Senator Kefauver himself had only died the year before, in 1963. The school is located in \\"Dacron, Ohio\\" (a reference to the city Akron, Ohio,Akron is the metropolitan area nearest Sandusky, Ohio--setting of The King of Sandusky, a fictionalised account of O'Rourke's childhood and to inexpensive synthetic fabric Dacron.) The parody is closely based on the Toledo, Ohio's DeVilbiss High School yearbook, called the Pot 'o Gold. O'Rourke attended DHS for a couple of years in the early 1960s. The swim team photo caption contains the names of a number of O'Rourke's friends from DeVilbiss. Like many great parodies, the Lampoon yearbook very closely mimics the style and content of actual yearbooks, only deviating in subtle ways. The publication also included a copy of the school newspaper, a basketball program, a report card, a diploma, detention slips and a fake ID. According to apparent inscriptions, the book belonged to \\"Larry Kroger\\", class of '64. The character Larry Kroger went on to become the college freshman protagonist (played by Tom Hulce) of the comedy movie National Lampoon's Animal House, released in 1978. The character \\"Mandy Pepperidge\\" also makes her first appearance in the Yearbook and reappears in the film (played by Mary Louise Weller). Five years after the Yearbook parody, in 1978, the National Lampoon published the National Lampoon Sunday Newspaper Parody, a fake Sunday newspaper which also claimed to originate in \\"Dacron, Ohio\\" but was contemporary, being dated Sunday February 12, 1978. The cover photo was taken by Vincent Aiosa. Note on cover The credits list the cheerleaders on the cover as models Roberta Caplan, Celia Bau, and Laura Singer.

Mobility can also be thought as the movement of people through social classes, social mobility or income, income mobility. A mobility \\"turn\\" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie \\"at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life.\\" (Cresswell, 2011, 551) The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a black box and ignoring or trivializing \\"the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest\\" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both sedentarism and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as nomadic and placeless in a frenetic and globalized existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements. Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John UrryUrry, J. 2000 Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century. London: Routledge.Urry, J., 2007. Mobilities.

Telematics and Informatics, 34(2), 560‚Äì568. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.09.011 proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‚Äòmacro-mobilities‚Äô (consistent physical displacements), ‚Äòmicro-mobilities‚Äô (small-scale displacements), ‚Äòmedia mobility‚Äô (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‚Äòdisembodied mobility‚Äô (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.Taipale, S. 2013.

Social Science Research 43C, 157-167, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.003 Scope While mobilities is commonly associated with sociology, contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in anthropology, cultural studies, economics, geography, migration studies, science and technology studies, and tourism and transport studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207) Mobilities as a specific body of research remains associated with a small group of largely British researchers, notably John Urry, Mimi Sheller, Peter Adey, Tim Edensor, David Bissell, and Tim Cresswell. However, Cresswell (2011, 555) notes that \\"many people involved in research on mobility topics do not see themselves as part of a new paradigm or turn\\" (e.g. Noel B. Salazar). The community of mobilities researchers, as well as the areas they research, have expanded across the globe. The eponymous journal Mobilities provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011): * Mobile spatiality and temporality * Sustainable and alternative mobilities * Mobile rights and risks * New social networks and mobile media * Immobilities and social exclusions * Tourism and travel mobilities * Migration and diasporas * Transportation and communication technologies * Transitions in complex systems Origins Sheller and Urry (2006, 215) place mobilities in the sociological tradition by defining the primordial theorist of mobilities as Georg Simmel (1858‚Äì1918). Simmel's essays, \\"Bridge and Door\\" (Simmel, 1909 / 1994) and \\"The Metropolis and Mental Life\\" (Simmel, 1903 / 2001) identify a uniquely human will to connection, as well as the urban demands of tempo and precision that are satisfied with mobility. The more immediate precursors of contemporary mobilities research emerged in the 1990s (Cresswell 2011, 551). Historian James Clifford (1997) advocated for a shift from deep analysis of particular places to the routes connecting them. Marc Aug√© (1995) considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of \\"non-places\\" like airports and motorways that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Sociologist Manuel Castells outlined a \\"network society\\" and suggested that the \\"space of places\\" is being surpassed by a \\"space of flows.\\" Feminist scholar Caren Kaplan (1996) explored questions about the gendering of metaphors of travel in social and cultural theory. The contemporary paradigm under the moniker \\"mobilities\\" appears to originate with the work of sociologist John Urry. In his book, Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century, Urry (2000, 1) presents a \\"manifesto for a sociology that examines the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, these diverse mobilities.\\" This is consistent with the aims and scope of the eponymous journal Mobilities,Mobilities ( (print), (online)) which \\"examines both the large-scale movements of people, objects, capital, and information across the world, as well as more local processes of daily transportation, movement through public and private spaces, and the travel of material things in everyday life\\" (Taylor and Francis, 2011). In 2006, Mimi Sheller and John Urry published an oft-cited paper that examined the mobilities paradigm as it was just emerging, exploring its motivations, theoretical underpinnings, and methodologies. Sheller and Urry specifically focused on automobility as a powerful socio-technical system that \\"impacts not only on local public spaces and opportunities for coming together, but also on the formation of gendered subjectivities, familial and social networks, spatially segregated urban neighborhoods, national images and aspirations to modernity, and global relations ranging from transnational migration to terrorism and oil wars\\" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 209). Mobilities can be viewed as an extension of the \\"spatial turn\\" in the arts and sciences in the 1980s, in which scholars began \\"to interpret space and the spatiality of human life with the same critical insight and interpretive power as have traditionally been given to time and history (the historicality of human life) on one hand, and to social relations and society (the sociality of human life) on the other\\" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 216; Engel and Nugent, 2010, 1; Soja, 1999 / 2005, 261). Engel and Nugent (2010) trace the conceptual roots of the spatial turn to Ernst Cassirer and Henri Lefebvre (1974), although Fredric Jameson appears to have coined the epochal usage of the term for the 1980s paradigm shift. Jameson (1988 / 2003, 154) notes that the concept of the spatial turn \\"has often seemed to offer one of the more productive ways of distinguishing postmodernism from modernism proper, whose experience of temporality -- existential time, along with deep memory -- it is henceforth conventional to see as dominant of the high modern.\\" For Oswin & Yeoh (2010) mobility seems to be inextricably intertwined with late-modernity and the end of the nation-state. The sense of mobility makes us to think in migratory and tourist fluxes as well as the necessary infrastructure for that displacement takes place.Oswin, N. Y., Yeoh, B. \\"Introduction: Mobile City Singapore\\". Mobilities Vol. 5 (2), 2010, pp. 167-175. R. Tzanelli (2014) explains that modernity has recycled the human emotions, particularly trauma, whatever their cause may be, to generate a logic of spectacle. Any mediated and consumed event not only destroys the previous states of conflicts and cleavages, but provides a one-sided ideological message to visitors. Tourism is for Tzanelli more than a mechanism to control, it is an instrument of ideology. The efficacy for state to reduce the discrepancy and discontent of citizenry consists in commoditizing the human suffering into affordable products.Tzanelli, R. (2014). \\"Embodied art and aesthetic performativity in the London 2012 handover to Rio (2016)\\". Global Studies Journal, 6(2), 13-24. P. Vannini (2012) opted to see mobility as a projection of existent cultural values, expectances and structures that denotes styles of life. Mobility after all would not only generate effects on people's behaviour but also specific styles of life. Vannini explains convincingly that on Canada's coast, the values of islanders defy the hierarchal order in populated cities from many perspectives. Islanders prioritize the social cohesion and trust of their communities before the alienation of mega-cities. There is a clear physical isolation that marks the boundaries between urbanity and rurality. From another view, nonetheless, this ideological dichotomy between authenticity and alienation leads residents to commercialize their spaces to outsiders. Although the tourism industry is adopted in these communities as a form of activity, many locals have historically migrated from urban populated cities.Vannini, P. (2012). Ferry Tales: Mobility, places and time on Canada's West Coast. New York, Routledge. Mobilities and transportation geography The intellectual roots of mobilities in sociology distinguish it from traditional transportation studies and transportation geography, which have firmer roots in mid 20th century positivist spatial science. Cresswell (2011, 551) presents six characteristics distinguishing mobilities from prior approaches to the study of migration or transport: * Mobilities often links science and social science to the humanities. * Mobilities often links across different scales of movement, while traditional transportation geography tends to focus on particular forms of movement at only one scale (such as local traffic studies or household travel surveys). * Mobilities encompasses the movement of people, objects, and ideas, rather than narrowly focusing on areas like passenger modal shift or freight logistics. * Mobilities considers both motion and \\"stopping, stillness and relative immobility.\\" * Mobilities incorporates mobile theorization and methodologies to avoid the privileging of \\"notions of boundedness and the sedentary.\\" * Mobilities often embraces the political and differential politics of mobility, as opposed to the apolitical, \\"objective\\" stance often sought by researchers associated with engineering disciplines Mobilities can be seen as a postmodern descendant of modernist transportation studies, with the influence of the spatial turn corresponding to a \\"post-structuralist agnosticism about both naturalistic and universal explanations and about single-voiced historical narratives, and to the concomitant recognition that position and context are centrally and inescapably implicated in all constructions of knowledge\\" (Cosgrove, 1999, 7; Warf and Arias, 2009). Despite these ontological and epistemological differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) have argued that mobilities and transport geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models. Shaw and Sidaway (2010, 505) argue that even as research in the mobilities paradigm has attempted to reengage transportation and the social sciences, mobilities shares a fate similar to traditional transportation geography in still remaining outside the mainstream of the broader academic geographic community. Theoretical underpinnings of Mobilities Sheller and Urry (2006, 215-217) presented six bodies of theory underpinning the mobilities paradigm: The prime theoretical foundation of mobilities is the work of early 20th-century sociologist Georg Simmel, who identified a uniquely human \\"will to connection,\\" and provided a theoretical connection between mobility and materiality. Simmel focused on the increased tempo of urban life, that \\"drives not only its social, economic, and infrastructural formations, but also the psychic forms of the urban dweller.\\" Along with this tempo comes a need for precision in timing and location in order to prevent chaos, which results in complex and novel systems of relationships. A second body of theory comes from the science and technology studies which look at mobile sociotechnical systems that incorporate hybrid geographies of human and nonhuman components. Automobile, rail or air transport systems involve complex transport networks that affect society and are affected by society. These networks can have dynamic and enduring parts. Non-transport information networks can also have unpredictable effects on encouraging or suppressing physical mobility (Pellegrino 2012). A third body of theory comes from the postmodern conception of spatiality, with the substance of places being constantly in motion and subject to constant reassembly and reconfiguration (Thrift 1996). A fourth body of theory is a \\"recentring of the corporeal body as an affective vehicle through which we sense place and movement, and construct emotional geographies\\". For example, the car is \\"experienced through a combination of senses and sensed through multiple registers of motion and emotion‚Ä≥ (Sheller and Urry 2006, 216). A fifth body of theory incorporates how topologies of social networks relate to how complex patterns form and change. Contemporary information technologies and ways of life often create broad but weak social ties across time and space, with social life incorporating fewer chance meetings and more networked connections. Finally, the last body of theory is the analysis of complex transportation systems that are \\"neither perfectly ordered nor anarchic.\\" For example, the rigid spatial coupling, operational timings, and historical bindings of rail contrast with unpredictable environmental conditions and ever-shifting political winds. And, yet, \\"change through the accumulation of small repetitions...could conceivably tip the car system into the postcar system.\\" Mobilities methodologies Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006, 217-219) presented seven methodological areas often covered in mobilities research: * Analysis of the patterning, timing and causation of face-to-face co-presence * Mobile ethnography - participation in patterns of movement while conducting ethnographic research * Time-space diaries - subjects record what they are doing, at what times and in what places * Cyber-research - exploration of virtual mobilities through various forms of electronic connectivity * Study of experiences and feelings * Study of memory and private worlds via photographs, letters, images and souvenirs * Study of in-between places and transfer points like lounges, waiting rooms, cafes, amusement arcades, parks, hotels, airports, stations, motels, harbors See also *Bicycle *Congestion *Hypermobility (travel) *Pedestrian *Public transport *Private transport *Transportation engineering References Books * *Canzler, Weert., Kaufmann, Vincent., & Kesselring, Sven.

The founder of the magazine, Babette Maxwell, also runs the associated Military Spouse of the Year Awards program. The magazine was first published in September 2004; in 2007, Maxwell sold it to Victory Media, Inc. Magazine development Maxwell is the Co-Founder and Creative Officer of Military Spouse magazine. Shortly after September 11, 2001, Maxwell, with no prior industry experience, founded the nation's only print publication for the over 1.1 million military spouses worldwide. In the first six months, Maxwell developed distribution and advertising to launch the premiere issue in September, 2004. The magazine revolutionized how military spouses are perceived in the national public eye and how they are treated by government offices and members of Congress. After the development of the Military Spouse Friendly Employers program by Military Spouse magazine, hiring military spouses became a popular, corporate trend. The magazine covers light-hearted material as well as controversial topics and hard-hitting news features. In 2007, Military Spouse magazine was acquired by the veteran-owned Victory Media, Inc., based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as part of the publisher's military niche market magazine lineup. The magazine has interviewed notable people such as Alma Powell, Senator John McCain, Toby Keith, Carrie Underwood, Catherine Bell, numerous other members of Congress, Department of Defense leadership, Gary Sinise, First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, former First Lady Laura Bush, and military charity founders. Military Spouse of the Year Award development The Military Spouse of the Year Awards program was developed by Maxwell, to provide the only merit-based national award program for US military spouses. It houses five branch winners, one from each military service, and a national winner that represents the entire community nationally for a full-year. The most recent winner, with the assistance of Maxwell and Military Spouse magazine, initiated the Military Spouse Education Initiative for the advancement of education opportunities for military spouses. Of note, in 2011, The Gabby Giffords' Award for Courage and Bravery was added to the program in honor of military spouse Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). Maxwell also added The Legislative Impact Awards to honor members of Congress who act of behalf of military families. In 2011, two were awarded to Representative Sanford Bishop (GA) and Representative Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (WA) for their work founding The Congressional Military Family Caucus. Criticisms Military Spouse's parent company Victory Media has been accused of acting as a lead generator for subprime for-profit schools.

The species is an upright, evergreen bush indigenous to tropical Australia, discovered in the early 1980s on the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, in an area of grassy forest land. The full extent of its distribution is unknown. The name Jedda is a toponym from Jedda Creek, which is close to where the type specimen was collected from. Description Jedda multicaulis is a multi-stemmed, upright, evergreen bush (1.5‚Äì2.5 m tall). Stems, which are smooth, reddish-brown, and cylindrical when young, and woody as they age, arise from a central corm. Glabrous, coriaceous, point- tipped, oval-shaped leaves (2.5‚Äì7 mm long √ó 8‚Äì25 mm wide), are arranged oppositely, or nearly oppositely, along the stems. Inflorescences (2‚Äì4 mm long) are clusters of usually three, occasionally up to five flowers, set in bracts.

Information The Clupeocharax schoutedeni is the only member of its genus. The amount of mature Clupeocharax schoutedeni has been slowly declining, and this has allowed this species to be recorded as vulnerable to becoming an endangered species. It is native to Lake Tumba, Lake Yandja, and the Central Congo River basin. They live in a pelagic habitat within a freshwater species. One of the main threats to reduce the population of this species is fishing with nets. The average length of the Clupeocharax schoutedeni as an unsexed male is about 25 centimeters or 9.5 inches. They are mainly found in Africa within the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It is the administrative headquarters of Salford City Council. History The Swinton and Pendlebury Urban District Council, which had been formed in 1894, had used Victoria House in Victoria Park as their meeting place. However, after the council became a municipal borough in 1934, it decided to seek larger premises. The site selected on Chorley Road in Swinton had previously been occupied by Swinton Industrial School. The foundation stone for the new town hall was laid by the mayor on 17 October 1936. The new building was designed by architects Percy Thomas and Ernest Prestwich in the neo-classical style after they had won a national design competition. It was built by J. Gerrard and Sons at a cost of ¬£80,000 and officially opened by the Deputy leader of the Labour Party, Arthur Greenwood MP, on 17 September 1938. The most striking feature of the design was the clock tower, in height, with clock faces on each side, in diameter. Percy Thomas was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gold Medal for his work in 1939.RIBA website RIBA Gold Medallists 1848-2008 (viewed 2011-11-13) A glass-walled computer centre was built to the south-east of the town hall, in order to cope with increased administration requirements, and completed in July 1973. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, Swinton and Pendlebury Town Hall, being one of the most modern town halls in the enlarged local authority area, became the meeting place of the enlarged local authority, known as the Salford City Council, in 1974. The council chamber was re-modelled at that time so that it was capable of accommodating a larger number of councillors. A four-story extension located to the south-west of the town hall, which was designed by Cruickshank and Sewards and built by Fairclough Fram Gerrard, was inspected by the Duke of Edinburgh during construction and completed in the late 1970s. The City Treasury Building, also known as \\"Unity House\\", was built by John Laing Group and officially opened by the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Margaret Beckett MP, on 9 October 1991. Following the closure of Kingslea House on Barton Road in 2007, the East Wing of the civic centre became the local register office and as well a venue for weddings and civil partnerships. In July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a mural depicting Salford's key workers, which had been painted by an anonymous artist, was left on the steps of the civic centre: council officials decided that it would be put on public display.

An individual \\"chime\\" displays a headline, the first few sentences of a post, a piece of multimedia, a profile picture, interest tags and options for liking, commenting and sharing.

Their primary goal is the design of microrobots, as well as the promotion of nanotechnology and their program. The group was founded in 2007, and their most recent accomplishment was winning the Microassembly Challenge at the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). They were the only completely undergraduate team, as well as the only Canadian team competing. UWNRG has since evolved from the robotics competition and now look into developing micro-robotics for industrial and medical applications through MAYA, and agriculture applications through Vision. Current Research = Vision = Vision is a research team formed in mid-2019 with the goal of combining micro and molecular biology with robotics. The current project, Healthy Hydroponics, is looking to create better indoor and fully automated plant growth machines by engineering bacteria and hydroponics system. Working under Dr. Trevor Charles, together, they have outlined the three main components of this project: a fully automated sensor wielding hydroponic system, the creation of aquatic bacteria that can express plant promotion and lastly, a microbial sensor to detect possible pathogens. More information can be found on the UWNRG website. Current Robots = MAYA = MAYA (Micro- Assembly YBCO Apparatus) is an experimental robot that utilizes the concept of quantum locking. By using this concept, the YBCO, a high temperature superconductor, can pic a micro-magnet in space above itself. From there, the position of the YBCO can be controlled using motors and actuators, which results in the movement of the micro-magnet. MAYA comes complete with an optical tracking system that can account for the error between the macro and micro-scale movements, resulting in high-precision actuation. More information can be found on the UWNRG website.  Previous robots  = MICHELLE = MICHELLE (Mercury in a Clear Habitat Enclosure Leveraging Lorentz Excitation) uses microfluidics to accurately move the robot through another fluidic medium. = SAM = SAM (Solenoid Actuated Microrobot) is the spiritual successor to the EMMA robot, utilizing the displacement of a magnetic field. = SAW = Utilizing acoustic waves as propulsion for a MEMS device, UWNRG's surface acoustic wave team (known as SAW) is attempting to diversify the group's arsenal of microrobotic achievements. The design for SAW was initially conceived following our success in the 2011 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge, and features the group's first entirely fluid reverse-piezoelectric microrobot design. The design consists of a nanolitre fluid droplet, moving atop a silanized glass substrate that has been patterned into an interdigital transducer (IDT). A lithium niobate wafer layered with titanium and gold thin films will be act as a surface acoustic wave generator, which will produce oscillations on the wafer surface. This will yield an excited fluid droplet, and ultimately result in linear propulsion of the fluid microrobot. = EMMA = EMMA (ElectroMagnetic Micro Actuation) is their best known project. It placed 3rd overall in the 2010 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge in Alaska, and first place in the 2011 competition in Shanghai, China. EMMA is made of a magnetic alloy which moves by displacing the magnetic field surrounding the robot (magnetic actuation). The team is currently working on a research paper, \\"Characterizing the surface tension around the robot at a micro scale,\\" and upgrading the design to have rotation along its axis. EMMA has several iterations, iteration 1 and iteration 1.5 having been completed. It is hoped that iteration 2.0 will be an improvement over current designs. Image of the Microrobot PAMELA. =PAMELA= PAMELA (Pump Actuation Mediated by Excited Light Absorption) is a microfluidic based MEMS which was first developed by the NanoRobotics Group. Originally proposed in 2007 by the founding members of the group, its design is to use thrust to manipulate the microrobot through a fluidic medium. The propulsion system of the robot is two small pumps made of a photosensitive membrane that will deform and expel fluid when a laser is shone on the membrane. The motion of the robot is determined by focusing the laser beam onto an individual pump to turn, or on both pumps simultaneously for forward motion. PAMELA is hoped to be an improvement on EMMA because it will have the ability to turn left or right which the current iteration of EMMA currently lacks. =MICROCOPTER= MICROCOPTER is being developed with a copter-based propulsion system. The robot uses a rotor-shaped magnetic dipole placed in a rapidly revolving magnetic field. The rotor will constantly align itself with this magnetic field therefore mimicking a helicopter if the magnetic field can be moved quickly enough. Past events = Waterloo Nanotechnology Conference (WNC) = UWNRG participated in WNC's poster session in both 2018 and 2019, where they presented their research and current experimental projects. In 2019, there was a live demo performed which showed the progress MAYA has made over the past year, which can be seen here. =The Nanotech Expo= UWNRG was a participant in the Nanotech Expo 2009 Tokyo, Japan in 2009, where the group traveled to Japan to represent the Canadian delegation, along with government officials and private organizations. The group was the only undergraduate organization at this international event. With the help of the groups mentors (professors and graduate fellows), the group presented its nanoscale pneumatic pump technology to an audience of Japanese government and industry representatives at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo. =NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge= The University of Waterloo's Nanorobotics group has competed in the Microrobotics challenge hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the past four years. During the 2013 Mobile Microrobotics Challenge at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Karlsruhe, Germany, UWNRG won first place in the Autonomous Mobility Challenge with the microrobot EMMA. At the ICRA 2011 in Shanghai, China, UWNRG placed first in the Mobile Microrobotics Challenge, beating over 10 other registered teams from top institutions internationally. This included entrants from the United States, France, and Italy. In 2010, UWNRG placed third place overall in the Mobile Microrobotics Challenge. Out of the registered teams, UWNRG was the only undergraduate and the only Canadian team competing. The competition required creating a robot under 600 micrometers in all dimensions and competing in challenges designed to test mobility, agility and control, such as the 2 mm dash, a challenge to move the robot in a figure 8 pattern, and microassembly challenges that involve using the robot to pack small triangular pegs together. The team plans to compete again in 2014. Members The team is made up of over 40 different undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo. The members of the team are divided into several independent sub-teams: one technical team responsible for designing each of the robots, the control systems group who write the software that controls how the robots respond in a situation, the business development team who are responsible for finding sponsors for the team, and the marketing team who organize outreach events and conferences for the team. The associated University of Waterloo professors include Dr. Yavuz, Dr. Prouzet, Dr. Cui, Dr. Mansour, and Dr. Fidan.

The periphery and base of the body whorl are decidedly rounded and inflated, marked like the space between the sutures. The aperture is large, suboval, slightly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is sharp at the edge but thick within. The columella is very strong, curved, reinforced by the body whorl, from which the slightly reflected edge is separated only by a narrow line. A strong oblique fold, not completely visible when the aperture is viewed squarely, is located a little anterior to the insertion of the columella.

The whorls of the teleoconch are slightly rounded, feebly contracted at the sutures, and very narrowly shouldered at the summit. The spiral thread at the periphery and the narrow tabulated summits, which fall a little anterior to this, render the suture narrowly channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a slender raised thread. The base is short, well rounded and impressed at the umbilical area. The entire surface of the spire and base is marked by slightly protractive lines of growth and many very fine, closely spaced spiral striations. The aperture is rhomboidal.

They are marked by strongly nodulous, decidedly retractive axial ribs, of which 14 occur upon the first, 16 upon the second to fourth, and 22 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked between the sutures by four spiral keels which are a little less strong than the ribs and render them nodulous at their junction. The spaces enclosed between the ribs and spiral cords are oblong oval pits on all the whorls but the last on which they are round. The sutures are subchanneled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a strong broad groove. It is curved by the axial ribs which extend to the posterior border of the first basal cord. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by six strong rounded, spiral cords which are a little weaker at the umbilical area than at the periphery. The spaces separating the spiral cords of the base are about as wide as the cords and are covered by numerous slender axial threads. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is obtuse.

The junctions of the axial ribs and spiral keels are very slightly nodulous. The sutures are deeply channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by a spiral keel. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by two spiral keels, which divide the space between the peripheral keel and the umbilical area into three equal parts, and the continuation of the axial ribs, which are fainter on the base than on the spire. The aperture is ovate. The posterior angleis obtuse. The outer lip is thin, rendered angular by the keels. The columella is slender, decidedly curved, reinforced by the base. The parietal wall is covered with a thin callus.

Greeman is best known for his studies and translations of the Franco-Russian novelist and revolutionary Victor Serge (1890‚Äì1947). Greeman also writes regularly about politics, international class struggles and revolutionary theory. Co-founder of the Praxis Research and Education Center in Moscow, Russia, and director of the International Victor Serge Foundation, Greeman splits his time between Montpellier, France and New York City. Early life and education Greeman describes himself as a ‚ÄòRed-diaper grand baby‚Äô who inherited the socialist books and ideas of his maternal grandfather, Sam Levin, in immigrant Russian- Jewish tailor from Hartford, CT. His father, Edward Greeman, was a decorated World War I ambulance driver, 1948 American Labor Party candidate for N.Y. Assembly, and a Veterans Against the War in the Vietnam era.Edward Greeman, Grandpa‚Äôs War, Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative, New York, 1992., NY, 1992. Richard graduated from Mamaroneck High School in Mamaroneck, N.Y. in 1957 and entered Yale College, where as a Freshman he became active in the George Orwell Forum and joined the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL).‚ÄòSocialism at Yale‚Äô by Richard Greeman, Class Book 1961, Yale, New Haven, 2011. During his 1959-60 Junior Year in Paris, Greeman participated in the anti-Algerian war movement as a member of the group Socialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism). Returning to Yale in 1960, he helped found the New Haven chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Greeman encountered Raya Dunayevskaya after reading her Marxism and Freedom and joined her Marxist-Humanist organization News & Letters Committees, where he remained active until 1973, when he was ousted by the central leadership after being denied a hearing.Minutes of the News & Letters Resident Editorial Board for March 13 and Sept. 12, 1971, Wayne State Archives, Detroit, MI. In 1961 Greeman enrolled in Columbia University, where as a graduate student and French teaching assistant, he was active in CORE, the Independent Committee Against the War in Vietnam, and Students for a Democratic Society. Greeman participated in the 1968 Columbia rebellion as a Junior Faculty member in support of the Strike Committee, and he received his Ph.D. at the ‚ÄòCounter-Commencement‚Äô on the student-occupied campus.Richard Greeman, ‚ÄòThe Columbia Rebellion,‚Äô New Politics Summer 1968. Richard Greeman, ‚ÄòThe Center Falls Out : the Role of the Faculty in the Columbia University Strike,‚Äô Radical Teacher, Vol. III, No. 2, April‚ÄìMay 1969. Academic and political career During 1963-64, Greeman returned to Paris with a French Government scholarship, took courses at the Sorbonne, began his research on the life and works of Victor Serge (1890‚Äì1947) whom he admired both as a novelist, a revolutionary witness, and a libertarian socialist thinker. In Paris Greeman was befriended by Serge's son, the Russian-Mexican painter Vlady, who encouraged his research and authorized him to translate Serge's fiction into English. To date, Greeman has translated and introduced five Serge novels,Victor Serge, Birth of Our Power (Doubleday, 1975), Men in Prison (Doubleday, 1977), Conquered City (Doubleday, 1976), Midnight in the Century (Writers and Readers, 1981), and Unforgiving Years (NYRB, 2010). most recently Unforgiving Years, voted one of Time Out New York's \\"Best of 2008.\\" Greeman has also prefaced and edited a number of Serge's books in French.Richard Greeman, Prefaces to new editions, Victor Serge, Retour √† l‚ÄôOccident : Chroniques 1936-1940 (Agone, Marseille, 2010) ; Les Hommes dans la prison ; Naissance de notre force; and Ville conquise, (Flammarion, Paris 2011). From 1964 to 1970 Greeman taught French and Humanities at Columbia College, then at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT where he was active in anti-war, labor and Black Panthers‚Äô defense groups and helped organize the May 1970 Student Strike which occupied the University. In 1973 he was denied tenure in a controversial case. In 1975 he became the father of Jenny Greeman, and joined the faculty of the University of Hartford in West Hartford, CT. Greeman was active in the Hartford Coalition for Justice in Central America, with CISPES and Nicaragua Network and in the defense of the Macheteros -- Puerto Rican Socialist Party defendants in the famous West Hartford Wells Fargo ‚ÄòRobin Hood‚Äô robbery.Richard Greeman, ‚ÄòMacheteros are Robin Hoods and U.S. is Bad King John‚Äô New Haven Register, Dec. 16, 1988. Greeman also traveled to Sandinista Nicaragua in the summer of 1984 to observe the elections and join Witness for Peace during the Contra war on the border of Honduras.Richard Greeman, ‚ÄòElections in Salvador and Nicaragua : The U.S. Twice Elects to Look the Other Way,‚Äô Hartford Courant, Nov. 15, 1984 ; ‚ÄòCan the White House Be Trusted to Respect that Contadora Process ?‚Äô Hartford Courant, Sept. 29, 1986. Twice rejected for tenure at the University of Hartford, he won on appeal and retired to France in 1997 to devote himself to writing and political work. Projects in Russia In 1991, during Russia's perestroika period, Greeman travelled to Petersburg and Moscow as part of the first group of informali : U.S. political, labor and environmental activists invited by their Russian counterparts. In 1993 Greeman organized the ‚ÄòBooks For Struggle‚Äô drive, collecting 88 cartons of non-Stalinist Left books and periodicals to be shipped to Russia. In 1997, he helped establish the Victor Serge Public Library in Moscow and in 1998 co-founded the Praxis Research and Education Center in Moscow, which promotes anti-totalitarian socialism in the ex-Soviet space. Praxis has published Serge's works for the first time in Russian translation as well as books by anarchists like Volin and libertarian Marxists like Maximilian Rubel and Raya Dunayevskaya. Praxis also publishes a newspaper, Free Thought, and holds annual international conferences. These projects are funded in part by the Victor Serge Foundation Inc., a 501(c)(3) US non-profit, established in 1997 by Vlady Kibalchich, Serge's son, with Greeman as Secretary, to accept tax-free contributions and promote Serge's writings and philosophy internationally. The Foundation is currently underwriting Arabic translations of Serge and related authors. Writings Greeman's essays on Serge have appeared in Yale French Studies, TriQuarterly, the Massachusetts Review, New Politics, Revolutionary History, International Socialism, ReThinking Marxism and Vuelta (Mexico).

Greeman‚Äôs is not a heavily footnoted, scholarly treatise. His lively style is likely to make this book particularly attractive to younger readers as will the high drama of Victor Serge‚Äôs life story. [‚Ä¶] Greeman‚Äôs work brings to light people and events in our recent past which deserve to be known by those struggling today.‚Äôhttp://www.usmarxisthumanists.org/articles/review-richard-greemans- beware-vegetarian-sharks-eli-messinger/ Political Ideas Individual Freedom Greeman argues that liberty of expression and freedom of assembly are not abstract principles but practical necessities for masses of people (as opposed to dictators) to seize and hold power. ‚ÄòIn politics,‚Äô Greeman observes, ‚ÄòMeans determine the End.‚Äô The tragedy of the Russian Revolution proved to early Communists like Serge that democratic Means‚Äîpluralism, respect for the ‚Äòother,‚Äô freedom of opinion, the availability of unbiased information‚Äîalone enable ordinary working people reach the End of true socialism, described by Marx as ‚Äònew human society‚Äô where ‚Äúthe freedom of the individual is the basis of the freedom of all.‚Äù Non-Violence A veteran of the American civil rights movement, Greeman sees mass non-violent resistance as both an effective tactic and a social ethic. ‚ÄòAgainst an adversary with endless weapons of mass destruction and surveillance systems, the resort to revolutionary violence is tactical and literal suicide. On the other hand, the ethic of non-violence promotes cooperation and encourages the participation of women, humanity‚Äôs majority group, whose leadership is essential in the struggle for a just and safe planet.‚Äô Greeman‚Äîwho in the 1960s was personally close to several members of the ‚ÄòWeather Underground‚ÄôSee Mark Rudd, Underground: My Life With the Weathermen (2009) and worked with the CT Black Panthers in the 1970s‚Äîrejects individual violence. ‚ÄòThroughout history, the world‚Äôs police have always resorted to agents provocateurs to infiltrate social movements and provoke violence, thus justifying state terrorism against the masses. Why do their job for them?‚Äô he asks. Self-organization Greeman sees the juxtaposition of Spontaneity and Organization as a ‚Äòfalse opposition.‚Äô The important distinction, he maintains, is between vertical bureaucratic organization and horizontal mass self-organization. He decries ‚Äòrule or ruin‚Äô approach of revolutionary parties who attempt to impose their ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô political line by taking over meetings and dominating broad coalitions. By stifling open debate and inhibiting the spontaneous emergence of mass self-organization, such self-appointed leaderships, with their factional rivalries, ultimately isolate and demoralize the movements they seek to lead. Greeman cites examples ranging from the manipulations of Stalin's Comintern in the ‚Äò30s to factionalism in the U.S. anti-war movement in the 1960s and 1980s.\\"Reflections on 1968 and Beyond,\\" New Politics, Vol II, No. 2, (New Series), Winter 1989, included in Beware of Vegetarian Sharks. In place of building a vertical Party to lead the revolution, Greeman proposes developing a critical, Marxist-humanist world-view and support for emergent horizontal self-organization leading to a planetary federation of assemblies where masses of ordinary people discuss and decide things for themselves. Internationalism Greeman believes in ‚ÄòActing locally while thinking and networking globally‚Äô within the ultimate perspective of a planetary general strike organized by a global federation linked by videostream connecting popular assemblies of creative/working people around the world. Greeman asserts that in a globalized age of multinational corporations, the masses‚Äô defense against global capitalism's increasingly aggressive attacks must also be global. ‚ÄòHow can you win a strike,‚Äô he asks, 'when management can ship your job to overseas dictatorships where workers are forced to work for less?‚Äô For Greeman, political tactics should be based on an internationalist ‚ÄòRule of Thumb:‚Äô ‚ÄòWill this tactic increase solidarity with people of other nationalities and identities, or divide them?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWill this tactic move us closer to our ultimate goal ‚Äì a new human society?‚Äô The Utopian Bet A hopeful pessimist, Greeman posited the odds on human society surviving capitalism's economic and ecological crises until 2100 as a nominal one in a hundred. But if there were such a ‚Äòchance,‚Äô we would have to take it. Mathematically, the leap to Ecotopia is [A Bet We Can't Refuse].‚Äô Following Pascal and Marx he asked: ‚ÄòWhat have we left to lose but a few more desperate years of struggling to survive in an increasingly violent, unhealthy, unequal, disintegrating society?‚Äô Not much, with a beautiful green world to win (and heal)!‚Äôhttp://www.stateofnature.org/ecotopiaABet.html  Greeman‚Äôs Modern Archimedes Hypothesis  Greeman argued that such a Utopian vision is both historically and scientifically defensible. In 1997, Greeman proposed as a model a ‚ÄòModern Archimedes Hypothesis‚ÄôRichard Greeman, ‚ÄòOn Building an International Network : A Vision in Three Parts,‚Äô Discussion Bulletin, International Conference ‚ÄòStop Capitalist Barbarism-- Prepare the Socialist Alternative, Cape Town, South Africa, Dec. 1997. outlining how the world's billions could collectively ‚Äòlift the Earth‚Äô out if its catastrophic capitalist orbit. This model proposed a Social Lever (‚Äòplanetary solidarity‚Äô), a Philosophical Fulcrum (‚Äòplanetary consciousness‚Äô), and a Place to Stand where the masses (the 99%) could unite their strength (the Virtual Platform of the Internet).http://www.zcommunications.org/how-to-get-from-here-to-there-a- modern-archimedes-hypothesis-by-richard-greeman Rejecting the notion that the Internet was an elitist gadget developed by the U.S. military and destined to be monopolized by commercial interests, Greeman saw the expanding Web as a potential class struggle weapon: one that would transform an revolutionary dream‚Äîthe international general strike‚Äîinto a technical possibility. Greeman observed that popular self-organization has been historically linked to progress in communications technology since the 18th Century. The American and French Revolutionaries depended on cheap printed pamphlets and the newly established Postal Service to unite their Committees of Correspondence. During the rolling revolutions of 1848 the penny-press and telegraph spread the insurrections from Paris to Vienna to the rest of Europe in days. Greeman observed that 20th Century one-way broadcasting technology favored the top- down power of demagogues and dictators from Churchill and Roosevelt to Hitler and Stalin. On the other hand, Greeman saw interactive Internet technology with its ‚Äòhacker ethic‚Äô and freeware mentality as an essentially egalitarian form of ‚Äòemergent‚Äô self-organization. It could also overcome the parochial nationalisms that have always divided humanity. He called the Internet international ‚Äòa vast conspiracy whose center is everywhere and nowhere!‚Äô\` Billions vs. Billionaires In 1999 Greeman projected this Ecopopian vision into an evolutive, collective science-fiction project.http://billionairesandbillions.wikispaces.com/ This site invites Internauts to weave their of own dreams of revolutionary emergence with others and become co-authors of an evolving Utopian collective novel designed to go viral and inspire a new generation with a positive Greeman‚Äôs ‚ÄòDream of Revolutionary Emergence‚Äô begins when a multi-player online computer-game called ‚ÄòBillions and Billionaires‚Äô goes viral, leading to a planetary general strike and the women of the world join in a dance-craze which goes viral and brings the macho madness of capitalist over-production and war-making to a grinding halt. In his ‚ÄòDream of Utopias‚Äô (based on Castoriadis‚Äô 1958 The Content of SocialismThe Content of Socialism) community and workplace General Assemblies federate on a global scale and begin the arduous work of repairing a severely damaged planet.

American Fisheries Society: Bethesda, MD (USA). . IX, 526 + cd-rom pp. Description The subdiaphanous to milk-white shell is slender and has an elongate-conic shape. Its length measures 3.3 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are immersed, the last one only being visible. This is somewhat tilted and marked by three strong narrow spiral keels and many slender raised axial threads which cross the grooves between the keels. The six whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, slopingly shouldered at the summit and separated by constricted sutures. They are ornamented by almost equal and equally spaced spiral keels and axial ribs between the sutures on the spire. There are 4 spiral keels on the first, second, and third whorls, 6 on the fourth, and 7 upon the penultimate whorl. The first of these keels is on the shoulder of the whorl near the summit and is somewhat less developed than the rest. The axial ribs are best developed on the early whorls, where they extend equally strong from the summit to the periphery ; on the antepenultimate and penultimate turns they become somewhat enfeebled from the middle of the whorl between the sutures to the periphery. There are about 16 of these ribs on the first, 18 on the third, 20 upon the fourth, and 22 upon the penultimate turn. The intersections of the ribs and spiral keels form low elongated tubercles, the long axis of which coincides with the spiral sculpture. The meshes enclosed by the keels and ribs are deeply impressed squarish pits. The periphery and the base of the body whorl well rounded, the latter somewhat inflated and marked by six spiral cords, which are successively closer spaced and a little less strongly developed from the periphery to the umbilical area. The channels between the cords are crossed by many very slender raised vertical threads. The aperture is oval, slightly effuse anteriorly. The outer lip is thin.

Its length measures 3.9 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are slightly rounded, well contracted at the sutures, and moderately shouldered at the summit. They are marked by nodulose slightly retractive axial ribs of which 20 occur upon the first to second, 18 upon the third, and 22 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the ribs the whorls are marked between the sutures by four spiral cords considerably less strong than the ribs, which render them nodulous at their junction. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and spiral cords are deep round pits. The sutures are well marked but not channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a narrow spiral groove. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by six strong broad rounded almost equal and equally spaced spiral cords, the grooved spaces between which are marked by numerous fine axial threads. The aperture is oval, slightly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is rendered slightly sinuous by the spiral cords. The columella is slender and curved, provided with a fold, deep within, at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.

The two whorls of the protoconch are moderately large, forming a helicoid spire whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is about one-fifth immersed. The eight whorls of the teleoconch are very strongly sculptured, with three spiral keels between the sutures, one of which at the summit is slender, the other two are strong and equal, the supraperipheral one being about as far posterior to the suture as the one at the summit is from its neighbor. In addition to the spiral keels the whorls are marked by narrow retractive axial ribs, of which 14 occur upon the first, 16 upon the second to third, 18 upon the fourth, 20 upon the fifth and sixth, and 24 upon the penultimate turn. The junctions of the axial ribs and spiral keels are somewhat tuberculated, while the spaces enclosed between them are deeply impressed pits. A strong keel marks the periphery of the body whorl and another equally strong occupies the middle of the base, the space between them being a concave channel, which, like the one posterior to the peripheral keel, is crossed by the axial ribs.

Description The milk-white shell has an elongate-ovate shape. The length measures 2.2 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, completely obliquely immersed in the first post-nuclear turn above which the tilted edge of the last volution only projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are slightly rounded, strongly tabulatedly shouldered at the summit, and decidedly sulcate at the periphery. They are marked by strong, well-rounded, curved, somewhat retractive axial ribs, of which 22 occur upon the second, 26 upon the third, and 30 upon the penultimate turn; on the first they are obsolete. The intercostal spaces are well impressed, about as wide as the ribs. The posterior edge of the peripheral sulcus coincides with the summits of the whorls, which render the sutures profoundly channeled. The sulcus is bordered on each side by a well- rounded, slender, spiral cord, which forms low tubercles at the junction with the ribs. The peripheral sulcus is crossed by the undiminished axial ribs, which break it up into a series of deep pits. The base of the body whorl is somewhat attenuated, with a shallow pit at the umbilical region. It is marked by the continuations of the axial ribs, which here have a decidedly retractive slant, and about twelve slender, spiral lirations. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is stout, curved, reinforced by the base. It is provided with a well-developed fold at the insertion of the columella. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.Dall & Bartsch, A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, p. 170-171; 1909 Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off Baja California.

Winners at the FPAs are awarded trophies in the shape of butt plugs. Criteria According to the official website, nominations for an FPA are dependent upon three criteria: #Women and/or traditionally marginalized people were involved in the direction, production and/or conception of the work. #The work depicts genuine pleasure, agency and desire for all performers, especially women and traditionally marginalized people. #The work expands the boundaries of sexual representation on film, challenges stereotypes and presents a vision that sets the content apart from most mainstream pornography. This may include depicting a diversity of desires, types of people, bodies, sexual practices, and/or an anti-racist or anti- oppression framework throughout the production.

Its length measures 3.5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are decollated, the pit left in the apex of the type shows that it must have been strongly immersed in the first of the turns of the teleoconch. The 4¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are strongly rounded, and feebly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by rather slender axial ribs, of which 20 occur upon all the turns. In addition to the axial ribs, the whorls are marked by 5 spiral cords, which are a little stronger than the ribs. The cords are about as wide as the spaces that separate them. Their junctions with the ribs form rounded tubercles, while the spaces enclosed between them are strongly impressed concaved pits. The suture is not channeled. The base of the shell is rather long, somewhat inflated, and well rounded. It is marked by 10 strong spiral cords, which decrease in size gradually and regularly from the periphery to the umbilical chink. The grooves between these spiral cords, which are about equal to the cords in width, are armed by numerous slender axial riblets. The oval aperture is decidedly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The thin outer lip is rendered wavy at the edge by the external sculpture. The inner lip is long, oblique, curved, and somewhat revolute. It is provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a moderately thick callus.P.

Its length measures 3 mm, of which ‚Öî are occupied by the body whorl. The whorls of the protoconch are intorted, somewhat obliquely immersed in the first turn of the teleoconch. The 4¬Ω to 5¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are slightly convex with a smooth sculpture. The growth lines are directed at right angles to the growth direction of the cone, but become flexuous or sinuous on the lower whorls. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. The sutures are well impressed. The narrowly oval aperture is rather large and occupies about ‚Öì of the total length, and is somewhat effuse anteriorly The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin. The base of the shell is quite short, rounded, and lacking an umbilicus. The columellar tooth is conspicuous and in a rather high position on the columella.J.J. van Aartsen, E.

The protest ended and all protesters evacuated the area on December 12, 2011 with promises to return to the park to reseed areas damaged by the camp. Organization There were 25 residents as of November 11, 2011. Meetings were held twice a day. Occupy hand signals were used so that no one's voice was drowned out. Drinking and drugs in the camp were not permitted. Sanitation for the encampment was provided by rented portable toilets and was offered by the nearby All Saints' Church. History The Occupy Windsor movement respected the wishes of Armoured Reserve Regiment's 75th anniversary celebrations by delaying the start time of the protests to allow the regiment use of the public space, officially starting the occupation of David Croll Park on October 15. During the protests the city staff of Windsor turned on water sprinklers and soaked the encampment as part of regular maintenance. In support of the Occupy Detroit movement (located across the US-Canada border), 50 people from Occupy Windsor group marched down to the waterfront and offered support. On December 9, the protesters announced their intention to end the occupation, with one of the protesters stating to the media, \\"We believe the encampment has served its purpose to make a statement that we have a right to freely assemble and conduct a dialogue [about] the concerns we have about how the political and corporate control over our lives is undemocratic.\\" After the protest was officially ended on December 12, 2011, four of the protesters expressed their concerns about being homeless to the rest of the group. In response, the group was able to, \\"with the assistance of the Windsor Police and the city social services department\\", obtain four apartments for the men to live in until longer term housing could be found. One of the other members involved with getting the apartments stated, \\"People from Occupy Windsor made a commitment to them. We're going to stay in touch.\\" While no longer actively occupying, the Occupy Windsor protesters, numbering around 50, protested on December 17, 2011 outside the Windsor city hall in regards to the discussion going on among the city council about \\"lower tuition rates, improved pension plans, poverty and the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Europe (CETA)\\". The protesters have stated that they are no longer going to occupy, but that they \\"will continue to hold assemblies and marches\\". Response The city and police force both indicated that the Windsor occupiers were generally well behaved and few complaints were registered against them. Mayor Eddie Francis explained that \\"taking action against a small group of peaceful protestors can lead to bigger problems.\\" Police Chief Gary Smith also stated, \\"I can't speak for the other agencies that check on safety and that, but nothing's been reported to us that's raised any concerns at this point.\\" One of the City Councillors, Drew Dilkens, threatened in early November to \\"lodge a formal complaint about the protesters not abiding by a bylaw requiring them to get a permit to set up tents and stay overnight in a public park.\\" He also made a statement to CBC News, saying, \\"I think we've been more than tolerant. So, I personally would like to see them gone, because I don't think their message is coherent...They pride themselves on being a leaderless movement, and I've never seen change without leadership...It's an accident waiting to happen.

Harrison moved to Texas, near Waco, in 1857. He was a commissioner for the State of Texas in negotiations with Native Americans (Indians). These negotiations were undertaken upon the order of Texas Governor Edward Clark, who replaced the deposed Sam Houston when Houston refused to swear allegiance to the Confederacy. The negotiators tried to persuade the Five Civilized Tribes to join with the Confederacy in the event of war with the United States. The negotiators returned with an optimistic report.Although Indian troops did fight for the Confederacy, they did not do so in the numbers the Confederates expected or in many major engagements. Their main contributions were as scouts and raiders, as soldiers at the Battle of Pea Ridge, and as soldiers under the command of General Stand Watie at various minor battles and raids.

Harrison's Confederate States Army service was almost entirely west of the Mississippi River. He began his service with the 15th Texas Infantry Regiment. He was lieutenant colonel of the regiment in May 1862. He participated in the Louisiana campaign of 1863 (First Bayou Teche Campaign) under Brigadier General Thomas Green. He commanded a cavalry brigade in the District of West Louisiana at this time. The 15th Texas Infantry made a successful charge on the Union force's rear in an operation along the Atchafalaya River in September 1863. Harrison also fought in the Second Bayou Teche Campaign.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published New York, McKay, 1959. p. 379Boatner names a fight at Bayou Bourbon on November 1, 1863, which occurred during this campaign. In 1864, Harrison was promoted to colonel of the 15th Texas Infantry. He participated in the 1864 (Red River Campaign) under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor. He received favorable mention in the reports of the commanders in both Louisiana campaigns. On January 6, 1865, Harrison was appointed and confirmed as a brigadier general to rank from December 22, 1864 by Confederate President Jefferson Davis.Sifakis, pp. 287-288 and Boatner, p. 379, show the date of rank as November 22, 1864.

His research interests also include space and nuclear instrumentation and radiation in space. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Fishman obtained a B.S. with Honors degree in Physics from the University of Missouri in 1965, followed by M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Space Science from Rice University in 1968 and 1970, respectively. Career While in graduate school at Rice University in Houston, Texas, Fishman served as a Research Assistant/Research Associate in the Space Science Department. He was involved in balloon-borne observations of high-energy radiation from space, and the research group was the first to detect gamma- rays originating from the Crab Nebula.Haymes, R. C.; Ellis, D. V.; Fishman, G. J.; Kurfess, J. D.; Tucker, W. H.; ‚ÄúObservation of Gamma Radiation from the Crab Nebula,‚Äù Astrophysical Journal, vol. 151, p.L9, Jan, 1968 Further observations showed that a large fraction of this radiation was from the pulsar in this nebula.Fishman, G.

C.; ‚ÄúObservation of Pulsed Hard X-Radiation from NP 0532 from 1967 Data,‚Äù Astrophysical Journal, vol. 156, p.L107, June 1969 In 1969, Fishman began his professional career as a Senior Scientist working on aerospace projects at the Research Laboratories of Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, Alabama. This research operation had been instigated by Milton K. Cummings, after whom the Cummings Research Park, the second largest in America, was named. Fishman joined NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville as a Research Scientist in 1974. From the start, he worked in high-energy astrophysics, and his interest soon centered on gamma-ray astronomy. Gamma-rays are generated by celestial events including supernova explosions, creation of black holes, destruction of positrons, and radioactive decay of the atomic nucleus of matter in space. Therefore, the detection and analysis of gamma-rays provide an insight on the fundamental nature of the universe. During 1978-79, Fishman took an assignment with NASA Headquarters as a Staff Scientist in the Astrophysics Division of the Office of Space Science. Upon returning to MSFC, he continued his work in gamma-ray astronomy. He was the Principal Investigator of the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)‚ÄùBurst and Transient Source Experiment, NASA‚Äù; on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). This observatory was the second (after Hubble) of NASA's four Great Observatories in space.‚ÄùNASA‚Äôs Great Observatories‚Äù; http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html After 14 years in development, CGRO was launched by the Space Shuttle Atlantis in April 1991 (STS-37). When one of the gyroscopes on CGRO failed, NASA decided that a controlled crash into the Pacific Ocean was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random; it was then intentionally de-orbited in June 2000. The primary objective of the BATSE experiment was the study of gamma-ray bursts. The BATSE experiment also serendipitously discovered terrestrial gamma-ray flashes above thunderstorms.Fishman, G.

Miner Agricultural Research Institute is a private, not-for- profit educational research institution with an operational dairy farm and Morgan horse herd located in Chazy, New York on the Adirondack Coast of Lake Champlain. Miner Institute currently encompasses over 8,600 acres of forest and agricultural land in the Little Chazy and Great Chazy river watersheds. The Institute is funded through an endowment, research grants and the sale of milk from its dairy operation. Created in 1951, the Institute's mission is to offer quality research, education, and demonstration programs addressing critical agricultural and environmental issues relevant to Northern New York, Vermont and Quebec farmers.  History  Heart's Delight Farm, the land that would become Miner Institute, was developed by William Henry Miner on his family homestead of 144 acres, beginning in 1903. Miner became a wealthy railroad industrialist as the inventor of railcar draft gears. After becoming a successful entrepreneur in Chicago he returned to Chazy.A North Country Legend ‚Äò‚ÄôWilliam H. Miner: A North Country Legend‚Äô‚Äô, Retrieved October 30, 2011 http://www.whminer.com/Publications/WH%20Miner.pdf He focused on farming and philanthropy, founding the Chazy Central Rural School, Physician's Hospital (now CVPH Medical Center) and expanding Heart's Delight Farm into all areas of agricultural production. Miner also oversaw construction of hydroelectric dams and powerhouses throughout Chazy and Altona. The largest dam, finished in 1915, cost one million dollars and held one billion gallons of water. It supplied power to the area for seven years until equipment failure forced its closing.Miner Open House ‚Äò‚ÄôOpen house shows interest in Miner Institute‚Äô‚Äô. July 28, 2009 Between 1910 and 1920 Miner purchased over 5,000 acres of land. At peak size the farm had 4,000 acres of tillable land, 2,000 acres of pasture and 6,000 acres of woodland. Fruits, vegetables, beef and dairy cattle, mules, sheep, pigs, chickens, turkeys, pheasants and brook trout were raised on the farm. In addition to the 800 regularly employed workers Miner hired around 100 families to camp at Flat Rock and pick berries. At the height of production Miner was shipping 16,000 quarts of berries a day to major metropolitan areas.Life at Flat Rock. ‚Äò‚ÄôLife on the Rock‚Äô‚Äô Westie, Leland. 2002. http://www.apnmag.com/natural%20selections/past%20stories/jack%20pine/jackpine.htm Heart's Delight food products were sold nationwide. The farm's 800 workers at that time worked draft horses, purebred horses and the farm had its own dairy, box factory, ice house, natatorium, greenhouses and gristmill. Miner also built a 20-bedroom guesthouse and an entertainment center named Harmony Hall, which included an auditorium, complete with a stage large enough for 300 people. Miner's will established the school and farm, The William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute.  Research  Miner dairy barnMiner Institute conducts research in the areas of crop-animal-environment interactions, cow comfort and behavior, and equine reproductive management. The Institute maintains research herds of Holstein dairy cows and Morgan horses. The dairy complex at Miner consists of four barns. A 160-cow freestall barn, built in 1970 for dairy cows, now houses pregnant heifers and far-off dry cows. In 1999, a freestall dry cow barn was built with attached calving pens. There is also a greenhouse barn for calves from weaning through four months. The newest addition is an insulated freestall dairy barn designed to accommodate dairying and research requirements. The current herd, consisting of approximately 300 registered Holstein dairy cows, is milked three times a day in a double-12 parallel parlor with automatic identification and pedometer system. The research wing is attached and includes tie stalls and Calan bin feeding areas.McCAdam Farms. ‚Äò‚ÄôMcCadam: Our Farms‚Äô‚Äô Retrieved September 29, 2011. http://www.mccadam.coop/farms.php  Community Outreach  Miner is also a demonstration farm, exhibiting crop, dairy, and equine production innovations for regional producers and allied industries. The Institute publishes a monthly dairy newsletter, The Farm Report, and quarterly equine newsletter, The Stable Sheet. In 2003, an on-site exhibit opened which covers the history of William H.

The day of greatness) is celebrated as a national day in Pakistan on May 28 in commemoration of Chagai-I and Chagai-II. The nuclear tests made Pakistan the seventh nation to possess nuclear weapons, and the first in the Muslim world. Etymology This phrase is recited by Muslims in many different situations. For example, when they are very happy, during times of extreme stress, to express approval, to praise a speaker, or as a battle cry (contemporarily used by Pakistan Army). In the Islamic world, instead of applause, often someone will shout Takbir or Nara-e-Takbir (in Urdu or Persian) and the crowd will respond with Allahu Akbar (God is great). The word is also used in Muslim prayers. The Government of Pakistan asked for proposals from the nation to decide a name by which the day should be celebrated. A country wide campaign was launched to select the name for this particular day. Thousands of names were propose by millions of Pakistanis. This name was suggested by more than one persons. All persons who suggested this name were given away Prime Minister Award. Youm-e-Takbir here can be translated to \\"The day of greatness\\" or \\"The day of God's greatness\\". History Nawaz Sharif (the then Prime Minister of Pakistan) and by the joint efforts of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan ordered the launching of the nuclear bomb test in response to Indian threats and nuclear tests (Smiling Buddha). The name was proposed by Iqbaliat Professor Dr. Shahid Iqbal Kamran of Allama Iqbal Open University in 1998. Sharif liked the name and gave the certificate himself to Shahid. Celebrations The day was officially signed by Prime Minister Sharif. It was first celebrated by giving awards such as the Chagai Medal to various individuals and industries in the fields of science and industry. The Sharif government also established the Chagai I Medal which was first awarded to the scientists of Pakistan in 1998 who witnessed the tests.

Starting in 1903, its motive power was a series of 4-6-2 (Pacific) steam locomotives. By 1905, it provided regular, daily service with six new cars strikingly decorated in three shades of maroon, with gold stenciling, which led to the nickname, \\"The Red Train.\\" The six-car consist included a RPO car, a combine car, a coach, a diner, and two Pullman parlor cars, one of which was the observation car.\\"The New Alton Limited Trains Between Chicago and St. Louis,\\" Vol 33, The New England Magazine (Oct. 12, 1905). The cars were richly appointed, and the Alton Limited was advertised as \\"The Only Way\\" and as \\"The Most Beautiful Train In America!\\"Advertisement, Vol 24, The Traffic World, at 1271 (Dec. 9, 1922). The last ten Brooks/ALCO class P-5 Pacific engines were delivered to the C&A; in 1913. Two six-car train sets were re-equipped in 1924 at a cost of a million dollars.

The GM&O; replaced the Pacific engines with diesel-electric engines, and replaced the heavyweight consist with lightweight, streamlined cars from American Car and Foundry. GM&O; adopted a variation of the Alton Limited's maroon and red livery for its own streamliners. The GM&O; dropped \\"Alton\\" from the train's name in 1958 and it was known as the Limited thereafter. =Amtrak= When Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) assumed railroad passenger operations in May 1971, it initially retained the service and the name (The Limited), with its Abraham Lincoln (which it also carried over from the GM&O;) running along the same route.

They were initially made of a mix of nylon and Lycra; more specialised fabrics have been introduced to provide moisture-wicking, compression, and odour reduction. The market has increased both through the popularity of yoga and because many women wear yoga pants as casual everyday dress. This is part of a long-term \\"athleisure\\" trend of increasing informality in dress, threatening sales of traditional jeans. The use of yoga pants for more formal and office wear has been criticised by Karl Lagerfeld and others. In the United States, the wearing of yoga pants other than for exercise has aroused controversy, both for school use and when worn by women. Global sales of yoga clothing have all the same grown rapidly, reaching some $31 billion by 2018. Origins Yoga originated in India as a spiritual practice.Monier-Williams, Monier, \\"Yoga\\", A Sanskrit Dictionary, 1899. In India in the early 20th century, the postures of medieval ha·π≠ha yoga were combined with movements from gymnastics, creating a new tradition of postural yoga. By the 1990s this had become a popular form of exercise across the Western world, especially for women. Yoga pants made of nylon and Lycra appeared on the market in 1998, sold by Lululemon in its first store in Vancouver as suitable attire for the yoga studio. Lululemon's founder, Chip Wilson, is said to have attended a yoga class in 1997 where the instructor was wearing \\"slinky dance attire\\" that fitted like a second skin, reportedly inspiring him to found his yoga fashion business. In 2005 Lululemon introduced a stretch fabric (Luon) with more nylon microfibre and less polyester, followed by several more specialised fabrics: a four-way stretch moisture-wicking fabric (Luxtreme), a compression fabric (Nulux), and an odour-reducing fabric containing silver as an antibacterial (Silverescent). Yoga pants increased in popularity, to the point where by 2014 American teenagers preferred them to jeans; the jeans manufacturer Levi Strauss, threatened with \\"an existential crisis\\", was obliged to make some of its jeans stretchy. Yoga pants took some years to spread around the world; the first Lululemon store in Europe opened in 2014, in London's Covent Garden. Numerous competitors entered the market, some of them like Nike, Adidas, and Target also offering specialised fabrics. Types Many styles and brands of yoga pants are available at a wide range of prices, determined primarily by brand: in 2015, a high-end pair from the specialist retailer Lululemon cost $98, whereas a less well-known brand sold by the general retailer Target cost $20. By 2018, there were over 11,000 types, according to Bloomberg, with a style by Lucas High on sale for as much as $230. Styles include the traditional boot- cut and flared yoga pants with a flat waistband. Basic yoga pants are black, tight-fitted, boot-cut, flared, and reversible; they are made of a four way stretch fabric, with a flat elastic waistband at the top. They provide flexibility and comfort, wicking moisture away from the body and helping to keep the wearer cool and comfortable. They may be made from blends of cotton, lycra spandex, nylon, polyester, wool, or similar light and stretchy synthetic material giving the pants a soft, smooth finish. Usage yoga class are wearing yoga pants; others wear shorts or tracksuit bottoms. Yoga pants have migrated from the yoga studio to the high street; from the early 2010s, they have increasingly been used as everyday casual wear. Women wear them around the house, as maternity wear, and for dancing and going to clubs. \\\\- Yoga pants have even been adopted as office wear; in 2014, Betabrand's \\"dress pant yoga pants\\" became its bestselling product. Fortune suggested that these could be paired with high-heeled shoes and a smart blouse to help them fit in. Jessica Grose, writing in Slate, responded that whatever was done to yoga pants to make them look more like dress pants (business suit trousers), they were still leggings. Suzanne Wexler, writing in The Vancouver Sun, agreed, calling yoga pants with heels and blouse \\"a fashion faux pas\\". The Atlantic however suggested, based on a preliminary 2012 study of \\"enclothed cognition\\", that wearing active clothing might encourage people to exercise more. The fashion historian Amanda Hallay noted that women want to look as if they are running to the gym, whether they are or not. Another fashion historian, Deirdre Clemente, states that athleisure clothing arrived when three trends came together: the technical improvement of fibres to create strong, long-lasting and flexible materials such as spandex; a Western fascination for appearing extremely healthy; and the decline of formality in clothing, allowing yoga clothing to blend into office wear. In Clemente's view, all three of these trends developed slowly throughout the 20th century. Rachel Marlow, writing in Vogue, noted that yoga pants had become acceptable wear for women \\"on the school run, in the line for morning coffee, over a business lunch, or even drinks\\". Demand for comfortable active, athletic, sports and casual wear has increased since the turn of the 21st century. Nike, Inc. reported their women's business comprised $7 billion in 2010. The larger athleisure market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015, and $48 billion by 2018. Nike claims the driving factor has been the demand for fashionable and flattering workout gear. New colours, patterns, and structural designs have created more versatility and increased the wearing of yoga pants in public settings. Author Mae Anderson, writing in the Denver Post in 2013, called yoga pants the \\"new jeans\\". Hollie Shaw, writing in the Financial Post in 2015, noted the \\"Lululemon effect\\" which had replaced jeans with yoga pants, despite hostile remarks about the style from Karl Lagerfeld, and observed that men too were starting to wear them instead of denim. Social issues In the United States, the wider adoption of yoga pants proved controversial for schools. Some schools adopted dress codes banning yoga pants for all students, or banning them only for female students. Bitch magazine argued such bans are largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by supposed \\"distraction\\" of boys by girls in tight clothing; similar complaints caused a ban in Rockport, Massachusetts, that was quickly reversed. In Montana, a 2015 bill supposedly sought to outlaw both yoga pants and leggings, but the representative concerned, David Moore, claimed that this had been a joke. The tight-fitting nature of yoga pants for adult women has also aroused discussion. In The Atlantic in 2014, Rosalie Murphy criticized the glossy yoga magazines such as Yoga Journal which always featured a shapely female yoga practitioner in tight yoga pants and tank top, \\"stretching her arms toward the sky or closing her eyes in meditation.\\" Time magazine recorded that in 2016, a man in Rhode Island wrote to a local newspaper calling the wearing of yoga pants by women \\"bizarre and disturbing\\"; in response, hundreds of demonstrators in tight clothing assembled in front of his house. In 2017, United Airlines prevented two young women from flying from Denver to Minneapolis as their leggings did not meet the dress code. In a New York Times opinion piece, Honor Jones argued that yoga pants were bad for women, stating that women were wearing yoga pants because of social pressure to be \\"sexy\\", and urged women to wear shape- concealing sweatpants instead. Anne Kingston disagreed with Jones, writing in Maclean's in 2018 that a looser style of sweatpants had already re-entered athleisure fashion, and that there were solid practical reasons for tight yoga pants, such as that they make it easier for instructors and students to check their body alignment, reducing the risk of injury.

After graduation, he did play on the pre-Olympic traveling USA Basketball Team. In 1979, the men's basketball team participated in the Soviet Union's Spartakiad, an international sports event that the Soviet Union attempted to use to both oppose and supplement the Olympics.

The case did not deal with sterilization directly but it concerned access to medical records of forcibly sterilized Romani women for the purpose of litigation of their rights. It was also the first case in which the European Court dealt with the right of access to medical records and with the right to so called \\"pre-trial evidence disclosure\\" neither of which have been previously defined under the European Convention on Human Rights. Controversy The case involved eight Slovak women of Romani origin, who suspected they had been sterilised when giving birth by caesarean section in Slovakian hospitals. None of the women had been able to conceive since their last caesarean delivery and were in doubt as to how this was possible. Some of them remembered being asked to sign legal documents during the delivery, but they were unsure regarding the contents of these documents and what they had actually signed. The women and their attorneys wanted to photocopy their medical records to achieve clarity in relation to their health status, in order to potentially prepare civil claims, and to ensure that the medical documents would not be lost or destroyed by the hospitals to cover up illegal practices. Despite extensive proceedings before the Slovak courts, the women and their attorneys were not allowed to photocopy the records and petitioned the European Court. The European Court found the violation of their rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights as it ruled that the right to respect for private and family life encompasses informational rights related to health and health status. Additionally, the European Court stated that the failure to allow them to make copies amounted to a violation of their right to access to justice under Article 6 of the European Convention, establishing for the first time a pre-trial evidence disclosure right. This aspect of the decision establishes that, if a state holds information about an individual that can potentially be used in litigation in the future, and if the state refuses to make this information accessible in its \\"physical\\" form (copy), the state is violating the individual's right to fair trial under the European Convention. By formulating two conditions of the right to effective access to medical information, the Court reinforced the human rights protection of data of a personal and specific nature.

History Stop is a work of about 20 minutes duration, written in a single session at the blackboard in 1965 during a composition seminar at the Cologne Courses for New Music 1964‚Äì65, in response to a request from a student for a demonstration of the process of creating a work, including \\"precise details\\". The instrumentation is flexible, and an organic process binding the whole together must also be developed from the basic score to make a version before it can be performed. The title stems from the fact that, from time to time, noises or coloured silences stop these processes of unfolding of groups of pitches (; ). In addition to the original score, two performing versions made by the composer have been published: a \\"Paris Version\\" for nineteen instruments, Nr. 18¬Ω (1969), and Stop und Start (Stop and Start) for six instrumental groups (twelve performers) (2001) Nr. 18‚Öî. The altered title of the 2001 version simply reflects the fact that a new sound group starts up after each interruption . The \\"Paris Version\\" was that of the world premiere, given on 2 June 1969 under the baton of Diego Masson in the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire, Palais de Chaillot, as part of the fifth of a series of seven concerts of Stockhausen's works . A \\"London Version\\" was made in 1973. Although this version was performed and recorded, it is close to the Paris version (Stockhausen 1978, 77) and has neither been published nor given a separate number in the composer's catalog. Form Stop consists of forty-two sections, each characterised by a different configuration of pitches, or by noises . The durations of these groups are related by proportions of Fibonacci numbers, while their pitches are based on a twelve-note \\"central chord\\", within which a succession of nine single tones progresses gradually downward, alternating with a rising progression of six bichords that suddenly falls into the bass register for an ending, seventh bichord. Interspersed amongst these single and double pitches there are six trichords in a falling-rising pattern, four tetrachords in a jagged down-up-down shape, and two widely separated six- note chords in groups 9 and 41 . According to a different analysis, there are twelve central tones that gradually fall (with one deviation in the middle) over the course of the work : G6 B5 G5 A4 G4 D5 E4 D4 F3 C3 F2 C2. Near the end, a concealed children's song appears \\"like wind\\", in agitated, dissonant tremolos over a solemn bass line . This tonal melody, introduced as a simulated short-wave radio signal, appears to be intended to provoke a strong emotional reaction . Although the score specifies that the six groups be placed \\"as far apart from one another as possible\\", the version conducted by the composer in London on 9 March 1973 did not differentiate them spatially . Instrumentation =Paris version= The instrumentation in this version is flexible, but the following scoring is suggested by way of example: *Group I: oboe, piano, synthesizer *Group II: synthesizer, trumpet, cello *Group III: vibraphone + tamtam, bass clarinet, electric cello *Group IV: cor anglais, synthesizer, bassoon *Group V: clarinet, violin, harp, trombone *Group VI: flute, electric bassoon, horn =London version= The instrumentation is based on the Paris version . *Group I: oboe, piano, electric organ *Group II: electronium, trumpet, cello *Group III: vibraphone + tamtam, bass clarinet, electric cello *Group IV: cor anglais, synthesizer, bassoon *Group V: clarinet, violin, harp, trombone *Group VI: flute, electric bassoon + alto saxophone + synthesizer, horn =Stop und Start= Although the details of the scoring are more exactly worked out in this version, it is also possible to substitute instruments, or even to increase the numbers, so long as the balance among the groups is maintained . *Group I: synthesizer and bass clarinet *Group II: synthesizer and trombone *Group III: synthesizer and basset horn *Group IV: synthesizer and saxophone *Group V: synthesizer and trumpet *Group VI: synthesizer (or percussion) and flutes (one player) In addition to the performers and a conductor, both versions are electronically amplified, requiring microphones, loudspeakers, and a mixing desk operated by a sound director.

Apart from the main island, Labuan consists of six smaller islands; Burung, Daat, Kuraman, Papan, Rusukan Kecil, and Rusukan Besar. Labuan was expected by the British to be a second Singapore, but it did not fulfill its promise especially after the failure of its coal production that did not become fruitful, causing investors to withdraw their money, leaving all machinery equipment and Chinese workers that had entered the colony previously. The Chinese workers then began involving themselves in other businesses with many becoming chief traders of the island's produce of edible bird's nest, pearl, sago and camphor, with the main successful production later being the coconut, rubber and sago. World War II brought the invasion of Japanese forces which abruptly ended British administration. Subsequently, Labuan became the place where the Japanese commander in Borneo surrendered to the Allied forces, with the territory placed under a military administration before merging into a new crown colony.  History  = Foundation and establishment = British flag for the first time on Labuan on 24 December 1846 following its foundation as a Crown colony Since 1841, when James Brooke had successfully established a solid presence in northwestern Borneo with the establishment of the Raj of Sarawak and began to assist in the suppression of piracy along the island coast, he had persistently promoted the island of Labuan to the British government. Brooke urged the British to establish a naval station, colony or protectorate along the northern coast to prevent other European powers from doing so which being responded by the Admiralty with the arrival of Admiral Drinkwater Bethune to look for a site for a naval station and specifically to investigate Labuan in November 1844, along with Admiral Edward Belcher with his to survey the island. The British Foreign Office then appointed Brooke as a diplomat to Brunei in 1845 and asked him to co-operate with Bethune. At the same time, Lord Aberdeen who was the British Foreign Minister at the time sent a letter to the Sultan of Brunei requesting the Sultan to not enter any treaties with other foreign powers while the island was under consideration as a British base. On 24 February 1845, Admiral Bethune with his HMS Driver and several other political commissions left Hong Kong to survey the island more. The crews found that it was the most suitable for inhabitants than any other island in the coast of Borneo especially with its coal deposits. The British also saw the potential the island could be the next Singapore. Brooke acquired the island for Britain through the Treaty of Labuan with the Sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddin II on 18 December 1846. Admiral Rodney Mundy visited Brunei with his ship to keep the Sultan in line until the British government made a final decision to take the island and he took Pengiran Mumin to witness the island's accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846. Brooke supervised the transferring process and by 1848, the island was made a crown colony and free port with him appointed as the first Governor. From 1890, Labuan came to be administered by the North Borneo Chartered Company before been reverted to British government rule in 1904. By 30 October 1906, the British government proposed to extend the boundaries of the Straits Settlements to include Labuan. The proposal took effect from 1 January 1907, with the administration area being taken directly from Singapore, the capital of the Straits Settlements. = World War II and decline = As part of the World War II, the Japanese navy anchored at Labuan on 3 January 1942 without being met by any strong resistance. Most treasury notes on the island had been burned and destroyed by the British to prevent them from falling into Japanese hands. The remaining Japanese forces then proceeded to Mempakul in the western coast of neighbouring North Borneo to strengthen their main forces there. Following the complete takeover of the rest of Borneo island, Labuan was ruled as part of the Empire of Japan and garrisoned by units of the Japanese 37th Army, which controlled northern Borneo. The island was renamed after Marquis Toshinari Maeda, the first commander of Japanese forces in northern Borneo. The Japanese planned to construct two airfields on the island with eleven others to be located in different parts of Borneo. To achieve this, the Japanese brought approximately one hundred thousand Javanese forced labourers from Java to work for them. 24th Brigade landing on Labuan on 10 June 1945 The liberation of the whole of Borneo began on 10 June 1945 when the Allied forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur and Lieutenant-General Leslie Morshead landed at Labuan with a convoy of 100 ships. The 9th Australian Division launched an attack, with its 24th Brigade landing two battalions at the island southeast protrudance and the north side of Victoria Harbour on Brown Beach while being supported by massive air and sea bombardments. The landings were witnessed by MacArthur on board the when he decided to proceed further south from the southern Philippines to Labuan. Following the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945, Lieutenant General Masao Baba who was the last commander of the Japanese army in northern Borneo surrendered at the island's Layang-layang beach on 9 September 1945. He was then brought to the 9th Division headquarters on the island to sign the surrender document in front of the commander of the 9th Division, Major General George Wootten. The official surrender ceremony was held on the next day on 10 September at Surrender Point. The town of Victoria had been damaged by Allied bombings but was rebuilt after the war. The island assumed its former name and was under British Military Administration (BMA) along with the rest of the British territories in Borneo before joining the Crown Colony of North Borneo on 15 July 1946.  Governor  The government offices of the British administration of the island Following the acquisition of Labuan, it was made a crown colony and governed by a Governor. Governor John Hennessy imported a group of Dublin policemen to clean up the island and enforce health regulations during his term. From 1880s, there had been a wide disenchantment over the position of Labuan as a crown colony among British administrators after the failure of coal production, causing the administration to be passed twice to North Borneo and the Straits Settlements. From the last years of British rule, the authorities encouraged the involvement of indigenous natives in the island to participate in politics although it was still controlled based on the interests of the British government.  Economy  Since its discovery by the British, coal has been found on the main island. Other economic resources include edible bird's nest, pearl, sago and camphor. The British hoped that the island's capital would grow into a city to rival Singapore and Hong Kong, but the dream was never realised. In particular the decline of coal production caused most investors to withdrew their investment. As a replacement, coconut, rubber and sago production became the main resources of the Labuan economy. Under the administration of North Borneo, its revenue was $20,000 in 1889, increasing to $56,000 in 1902. Imports in 1902 were $1,948,742, while exports reached $1,198,945.  Society  2 cents Labuan postage stamp featuring Queen Victoria, = Demography = The island had a population of about 2,000 in 1864, 5,853 in 1890, 6,545 in 1911, and 8,963 in 1941. The population is mainly Malays (mostly Bruneian and Kedayan) and Chinese, with a remainder of European and Eurasian. The Europeans were mainly government officials and staff of companies, the Chinese were the chief traders with most of the industries in the island in their hands, while the Malays were mostly fishermen. = Public service infrastructure = A telegraph line was established from Labuan to Sandakan on neighbouring North Borneo in 1894. Postal services were also available throughout the administration, with a post office operating on the island by 1864 and used a circular date stamp as a postmark. The postage stamps of India and Hong Kong were used on some mail, but they were probably carried there by individuals rather than being on sale in Labuan. Mail was routed through Singapore. From 1867, Labuan officially used the postage stamps of the Straits Settlements but began issuing its own in May 1879.

It was released in the United Kingdom as Ten Little Indians, in keeping with a later United Kingdom title of Christie's novel. Plot Eight people, all total strangers to each other, are invited to a small, isolated island off the coast of Devon, England, by a Mr. and Mrs. Owen. Ferried over by a sailor called Narracott, they settle in at a mansion tended by two newly-hired servants, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, but their hosts are absent. When the guests sit down to dinner, they notice the centerpiece, ten figurines of Indians in a circle. Afterward, Thomas Rogers puts on a gramophone record, from which a voice accuses them all of murder: * General Sir John Mandrake (C. Aubrey Smith), of ordering his wife's lover, a lieutenant, to his death * Emily Brent (Judith Anderson), of the death of her young nephew * Dr. Edward G. Armstrong (Walter Huston), of drunkenness which resulted in a patient dying * Prince Nikita Starloff (Mischa Auer), of killing two children while speeding * Vera Claythorne (June Duprez), of murdering her sister's fianc√© * Judge Francis J. Quinncannon (Barry Fitzgerald), of being responsible for the hanging of an innocent man * Philip Lombard (Louis Hayward), of killing 21 East African tribesmen * William H. Blore (Roland Young), of perjury, resulting in an innocent man's death * Thomas (Richard Haydn) and Ethel Rogers (Queenie Leonard), of the demise of their previous employer, an invalid. It turns out that none of the ten knows or has even seen \\"U. N. Owen,\\" as he signed his instructions to Rogers; they suddenly realize it stands for \\"unknown.\\" The guests decide to leave, but Rogers informs them that the boat will not return until Monday, and it is only Friday. Starloff admits to running down a couple while speeding. Then he takes a drink and dies from poison. The next morning, the guests learn that Mrs. Rogers has died in her sleep. Quinncannon reports that Rogers found one figurine broken after Starloff's demise. Now another is missing. With two deaths matching the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme, they search the island for \\"Mr. Owen\\" without success. After General Mandrake is stabbed in the back, the judge arrives at the only explanation: Owen must be one of them. Another day passes. Everyone votes secretly for whom they suspect. Only Rogers receives two votes, and is sent to spend the night in the woodshed. After locking the dining room, they give Rogers the key. The next morning, however, they find him dead, his head split open with an axe. Miss Claythorne persuades Miss Brent to reveal that she had her nephew placed in a reformatory, where he hanged himself. Later that day, Miss Brent's body is found with a hypodermic needle nearby. Armstrong discovers that his is missing. Lombard admits he had a revolver, but it is lost as well. At dinner, Quinncannon confesses he sentenced an innocent man to death to ruin the defending counsel's reputation. Armstrong then admits to operating while drunk, with fatal results. Blore grudgingly discloses that he perjured himself to put an innocent man in prison, where he died. Lombard merely states that the accusation against him is true. When it is Miss Claythorne's turn, she excuses herself to get her coat. The others hear her shriek and rush to her. In the confusion, a single gunshot is heard. They find her shaken after being brushed by seaweed hanging from the ceiling. They eventually find Lombard's gun, and Quinncannon dead from a shot to the head. Miss Claythorne insists she is innocent, but Armstrong contends that only a person who had not committed a crime would want to mete out \\"justice\\", and locks her in her room. Later that night, she wakes to find Lombard outside her window. After he gives her his gun, she lets him inside. He persuades her to admit that it was her sister who killed her own fianc√©, and that Miss Claythorne helped her cover up the crime and unofficially took the blame. They hear someone going downstairs. Upon investigation, they realize that Armstrong is missing. The next morning, Blore goes outside to look for Armstrong and is struck by stonework toppled from the floor above. Lombard takes binoculars found beside the body and sees what Blore had‚Äîa corpse on the beach. It is Armstrong. Miss Claythorne pulls out the gun, now certain that Lombard is the killer. He tells her that his real name is Charles Morley, and that the real Lombard was his friend and had committed suicide. Morley has a flash of insight and urges Vera to shoot him. Miss Claythorne fires and Morley drops. Returning to the mansion, she finds a noose hanging in the parlor and discovers who Owen is: Quinncannon, very much alive. The judge tells her that all his life he had searched for perfect justice. After learning that he was terminally ill, he concocted this plan. He persuaded Armstrong to fake his (Quinncannon's) death, supposedly to help catch Owen, then murdered Armstrong. He tells Miss Claythorne that she can either hang herself or be sent to the gallows (as the only possible perpetrator). He drinks poisoned whiskey, and Morley suddenly appears behind him. Vera missed the shot intentionally. Seeing a shadow by the door, they think that it is Owen, but discover it is Narracott. They leave him to discover what is going on and rush to the boat.

The film being shown was this 1945 American film directed by Ren√© Clair. Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC miniseries with the title And Then There Were None, which she said \\"has been an enormous hit in the UK.\\" In general, \\"Christie‚Äôs work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\\" The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games, \\"a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn‚Äôt hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\\" Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \\"to conjure up a thrilling ‚Äòotherness‚Äô, a place where revelations about the ‚Äòdark side‚Äô of the English would be appropriate.\\" Speaking of the \\"widely known\\" 1945 movie, Stein added that \\"we‚Äôre merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn‚Äôt hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\\" She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \\"that original title, it jars, viscerally.\\" Later film versions Christie's mystery has been filmed a number of times, including as Ten Little Indians (1965), Ten Little Indians (1974), Desyat Negrityat (1987) and Ten Little Indians (1989), with variations to its characters and locale.

It was written by Samuel Edward Krune Mqhayi (1875‚Äì1945) and published in 1914, by the Lovedale Press. Since that time it has been a significant influence on isiXhosa literature. Plot The story is set in the time of the historical King Hintsa kaKhawuta (1789‚Äì1835), and concerns a dispute between the fictional twins Wele and Babini over their deceased father‚Äôs estate. As they are born on the same day, there is a dispute as to who should take their father‚Äôs place. This is resolved via a traditional Xhosa legal trial, held at the court of King Hintsa, who presides over the trial. Various people give testimony, key among them Khulile, an inyanga (a wise, old sage) and thus a vital source of oral tradition, and the midwives who helped at the twins‚Äô birth. The story also concerns the decreasingly practiced tradition of certain tribes of Xhosa people. Ingqithi, or ‚Äòfinger cutting‚Äô, whereby a child has a finger amputated from the first knuckle. It is reported to cure bed-wetting and prevents the child from becoming mentally disturbed or even injuring themselves by biting their finger.https://wsusna.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/what-is-ingqithi/ A midwife, Teyase, is able to verify who is the first born by virtue of the cut finger (only one twin had his finger cut, the second born). Khulile notes that the reason the first-born is usually given priority and made his father‚Äôs successor is that he has more experience than his younger brothers, but that in the case of twins this argument does not really stand.Nyamende, Abner. The Conception and Application of Justice in SEK Mqhayi's Ityala Lamwele. Tydskrif vir Letterkunde. 47 (2): 2010. p. 27 By the end of the trial, both brothers are humbled and each proclaims the seniority of the other.Nyamende, p. 27 Reception The novel is often described as a defence of traditional, precolonial Xhosa law,S.E.K. Mqhayi, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 13 Nov. 2011. which was often disparaged by colonial authorities. The literary historian Albert Gerard argues that the book's ‚Äòreal value lies in the magnificent exploitation of the intricacies of the Xhosa language‚Äô and the way in which it ‚Äòvalidates the cultural values of the Xhosa‚Äô.Nyamende, p.22 Mqhayi certainly lamented the passing away of Xhosa traditions with colonialism, and wrote in the introduction to Ityala lamawele that ‚ÄòIntetho nemikhwa yesiXhosa iya itshona ngokutshona ngenxa yeLizwi nokhanyo olukhoyo, oluze nezizwe zaseNtshonalanga‚Äô, translated by Abner Nyamende as ‚ÄòThe language and mode of life of the Xhosa people are gradually disappearing because of the Gospel and the new civilization, which came with the nations from the West‚Äô.Nyamende, p.28 Editions There have been six different editions of the novel. The first edition (1914) had just nine chapters. The second edition (1915) had twenty chapters and included far more historical information. The edition in print today is an abridged version, which has only 16 chapters. According to Jeff Peires, Mqhayi agreed to an abridged edition of his novel being published only if Lovedale Press also kept the enlarged edition, but this was ignored after his death.Peires. Jeff. Lovedale Press: Literature for the Bantu Revisited. English in Africa. Vol 7 (1): March 1980. Today only the abridged edition is in print, and copies of the enlarged edition are very scarce.Opland, Jeff. Abantu Besizwe. Johannesburg: Wits University Press, 2010. Despite Mqhayi‚Äôs great fame in traditional Xhosa culture (Nelson Mandela recalls that hearing him perform was one of the highlights of his youth),Mandela, Nelson. Long Walk to Freedom. p.49. his work is not readily available. Something of this has been remedied with the 2010 publication of Abantu Besizwe, an anthology of some of Mqhayi's writings edited by scholar Jeff Opland. Abantu Besizwe also includes translations into English from parts of the abridged version of Ityala lamawele. It has also been adapted into a TV drama by the SABC.

Hoffmeister is associate professor emeritus and former director of the Center for the Study of Communication & Deafness at Boston University. He is most known for his book, Journey into the Deaf World. He is also known for supporting the American deaf community and deaf education. Biography Hoffmeister grew up at the residential American School for the Deaf in West Hartford, Connecticut. His parents were both teachers at the school and were both deaf. Hoffmeister attended the University of Connecticut, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Language. He received his master's degree in Deaf Education from the University of Arizona in the following year and his doctorate in Psychology, and Language and the Deaf in 1978 from the University of Minnesota.Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Robert Hoffmeister. A Journey into the Deaf-World. San Diego, Calif: DawnSignPress, 1996. Print.Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Robert Hoffmeister. A Journey into the Deaf-World. San Diego, Calif: DawnSignPress, 1996. Print. In 1980 at Boston University he created the first university major and specialization in Deaf Studies.Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Robert Hoffmeister. A Journey into the Deaf-World. San Diego, Calif: DawnSignPress, 1996. Print. He was a director of Programs in Deaf Studies until 2008. From 1979-2008, he was also director for the Graduate Program for Education of the Deaf and ASL/ Deaf Studies. He is an associate professor emeritus and the former director of the Center for the Study of Communication and Deafness at Boston University. According to Boston University he has done studies in the following areas:\\"the acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL) by Deaf children; Deaf people as a bilingual/bicultural minority group; problems in the education of the Deaf; the effects of implementing public laws on Deaf children; and the improvement of interactions between Hearing parents and their Deaf children\\"\\"Robert J. Hoffmeister ¬ª Academics.\\" Boston University. Web. 29 Oct. 2011. . His most well known written work is the book Journey Into the Deaf-World, which he coauthored with Harlan Lane and Ben Bahan. He is currently director emeritus of the Center for Research and Training, a department of The Learning Center for Deaf in Framingham, Massachusetts.  Publications  His most well known book, A Journey into the Deaf World, is written by two scholars, one of whom is deaf and one hearing, and Hoffmeister himself, who is a child of a deaf adult. Applying modern social theories, Hoffmeister and his coauthors offer insights into the deaf world, the community that it is made up of, and the benefits brought to the community by the language it uses (American Sign Language). The book also refers to the topics of education of deaf children, how deaf people assimilated into wider society, the natural development of ASL, the pros and cons of technology for deaf individuals, what can be learned from deaf societies in other countries, and what the deaf world holds in the future. This book is very popular for those who want to learn about the deaf world. Another notable written work that Hoffmeister is known for is the chapter that he contributed in the book called Manual Communication Implications for Education, where he explains the ups and downs of the use of ASL in the education of deaf children, as well as the structure of ASL: its phonological and morphological components, classifiers and sentence level structure. Lastly, the chapter explains bilingual and bicultural programs in deaf education.Bornstein, Harry. Manual Communication: Implications for Education. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet UP, 1990. Print. In the book Cross- Cultural Misinformation: What Does Special Education Say About Deaf People Hoffmeister shows how society views deafness. This book explains the information presented in special education text books to determine how issues surrounding deaf persons are presented. He evaluates thirteen special education text books to analyze whether it presents a pathological view or cultural view on deaf children. The majority of the text books focused on the idea that deaf people need to be cured, rather than focusing on the fact that deaf people have their own language and culture. From Hoffmeister's viewpoint, there is no input in these textbooks from the deaf community, and in some cases there is active avoidance to include the viewpoints of deaf people.Hoffmeister, Robert. \\"Cross-cultural Misinformation: What Does Special Education Say About Deaf People.\\" Disability and Society. 11.2 (1996): 171-190. Print. Hoffmeister co-wrote the article Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children with Brenda Schick, Peter De Villers and Jill De Villers. The article summarized their study on Theory of mind (ToM) abilities in deaf children. 176 deaf children of varying ages participated in the study, with some as old as eight years of age and some as young as three. The children either used American Sign Language (ASL) or oral English, and some had hearing parents, while others had deaf parents. The study concluded that \\"there was a significant delay on ToM tasks in deaf children of hearing parents, who typically demonstrate language delays, regardless of whether they used spoken English or ASL. In contrast, deaf children from deaf families performed identically to same-aged hearing controls (N=42).\\"\\"Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children - Schick - 2007 - Child Development.\\" Wiley Online Library. Web. 11 Dec. 2011. . Moreover, both understanding of syntactic and vocabulary were predictors of verbal and low-verbal ToM tasks success. In the book Language Acquisition by Eye Hoffmeister explains how deaf children learn literacy skills, including reading skills as well as literacy skills in American Sign Language (ASL), which have only recently been identified. According to Hoffmeister, language and literacy skills in ASL in deaf education have not been recognized as having the potential impact of helping deaf children acquire English literacy skills, despite the fact that ASL is the most widely used language among deaf people in the U.S.A and Canada. Furthermore, the support of using ASL in the class room has not been agreed on because there is no shared written form of the language.Chamberlain, Charlene. Language Acquisition by Eye. Print. In Why Schools for Deaf Children Should Hire Deaf Teachers: A Preschool Issue Hoffmeister, along with his coauthor Courtney Shantie, determines that bilingual education for deaf children is the best way for them to learn. He argues that the best role models for deaf children are those who use American Sign Language (ASL) in early education, which means that deaf students' preschool teachers should be native signers. Additionally, he discusses the problems that exist using manual codes of English for the education of deaf children. ERIC ‚Äì World‚Äôs Largest Digital Library of Education Literature. Web. 11 Dec. 2011. . In the book Open Your Eyes: Deaf Studies Talking, Hoffmeister explains the lives of hearing children of deaf parents (HCDP). He relates HCDP's lives to living on the \\"border\\", and also examines the lives of minority groups in the U.S.A and their managing of two cultures. Hoffmeister explains that the concept of border refers to a Venn diagram, where the deaf and HCDP are not exclusive to each other, but have both overlapping and separate components.Bauman, H-Dirksen L. Open Your Eyes: Deaf Studies Talking. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2008. Print.  Research  Hoffmeister studies how deaf children think using ASL, as well as how hearing people acquire ASL as a second language, and the most difficult environments for learning ASL. He also developed the American Sign Language Assessment Instrument (ASLAI), which began in 1988. This is used to measure the different levels of signing skills in children who are deaf. Lastly, he studies how deaf children use ASL to learn English.\\"VITA : Robert J. Hoffmeister.\\" Boston University. Web. 29 Oct. 2011.  Honors  Hoffmeister has received several awards. In 2010, he received \\"The Frederick C. Schreiber Award\\" from the National Association for the Deaf, presented in memory of Frederick C. Schreiber, their first executive director, for the advancement of civil rights, human rights, and linguistic rights of Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing. He also received \\"The Distinguished Service Award\\" and \\"The Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet Award\\" in recognition of his commitment to the deaf community.  References  External links * Robert J.

The length of the document is usually limited to 2 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices), although some conferences may allow slightly longer articles. If the conference does not specify a document style, the standard double-column IEEE format is a common practice. The concept of a \\"fast abstract\\" was created at the 28th Fault- Tolerant Computing Symposium, 1998, by Ram Chillarege, who was the program co- chair of the conference. They are meant to promote communication and discussion of subjects that have yet to be established or completed as research projects, and to provide a venue for reporting barely tested ideas, early experiments, or opinions. While informal discussions, stand-up talks, and round tables provide an avenue for such sharing, they lack the written record that is essential for academic progress. Fast abstracts aim to fill this gap. Since their inception, fast abstract sessions have been gradually adopted by several conferences, in some cases even being among the most attended sessions. Due to their purpose and short length, fast abstracts do not require a full treatment of results as expected of a full paper published at a conference or journal. Even less formal publications such as working papers and technical reports are usually based on established research projects, and on the other hand these rarely are peer reviewed before publication, and there is no formal publishing procedures for such reports. Fast abstracts differ in these two aspects, and being (as the name indicates) fast to write and fast to review, they create a mechanism to promote a rich and timely exchange of experiences, and receive early feedback from the community. Fast abstracts allow authors to: * Report technical work at preliminary stages, and solicit early feedback * Present radical opinions on controversial issues or open problems * Introduce new issues to investigate * Present experience obtained from practice Fast abstract sessions can collect a diverse set of contributions, from young students initiating their research work, to senior researchers and distinguished members of the community. Furthermore, they allow industrial practitioners and academics who may not have been able to prepare full papers due to time and work pressure, but nevertheless seek an opportunity to engage with the community, to exchange their ideas and solutions, as well as technical problems and practical experience.

In the 18th century part of the estate was in Tisbury parish and part in Donhead St Andrew. In 1835 Tisbury was divided into three parishes: East Tisbury, West Tisbury and Wardour. In 1927 East Tisbury and Wardour were united as Tisbury civil parish. Wardour Catholic Primary School was built in 1862. John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870-1872) said of Wardour: Quarrying The parish was noted for its quarrying, particularly Chilmark Stone, Tisbury Stone and Vale of Wardour Stone. Chicksgrove Quarry was operated near Tisbury in the Vale of Wardour. The Purbeck beds in Wardour have long been abandoned.

This tradition began with the importation of the Byzantine Empire's religious music when the Kievan Rus' converted to Orthodoxy in 988.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp. 217-241 Origins When Prince Vladimir of Kyiv converted to Orthodoxy, Mount Athos was the musical center of the Orthodox world. Monks from all over Eastern Europe and Byzantium traveled to Mount Athos for musical training and to learn the ways of Orthodox chant.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, page 218 At Mount Athos, Rus'ian monks learned the Byzantine neumatic notation for chant, which they readily adopted and brought back with them to Rus'. This Byzantine chant quickly changed to a distinct Rus'ian style, the Znamenny Chant.Alfred J. Swan, The Znamenny Chant of the Rus'ian Church--Part I. The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 2 (1940), pp. 232-243, page 232 The chant flourished and spread to the north (Novgorod principally) and southwest. From the sack of Kyiv in 1240 and subsequent occupation of the Rus‚Äô by the Mongols until their expulsion in 1480, few resources regarding Rus'ian music date,Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, page 219 but what little records exist show little change to the Znamenny chant other than small notational changes. Development In the 16th century, the Rus'ian liturgical tradition split between the north (the Moscow-dominated region) and the southwest (near Kyiv). In the North, the Znamenny chant and Demestvenny chant began to grow more elaborate. The neumatic system became increasingly intricate. Additionally, regional variants and neumes became part of the established tradition in those areas, making it nigh impossible for singers to sight-read any chant from paper.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, page 220-221 The chant itself also became far more melismatic than before. This led to the establishment of singing schools attached to monasteries, the most notable being the Novgorod school. Ivan IV, moved the Novgorod school to Moscow to increase the Kremlin‚Äôs prestige. The Tsar was also a composer of chant, two of which still exist today in readable and performable condition. Polyphony also appears during this time period in the form of heterophony, which in the Russian tradition meant multiple singers singing the base chant and freely improvising around it while retaining strong ties to the core chant.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, page 225 In the Southwest, the Orthodox Church based in Kyiv faced constant competition from the nearby Catholic Church. To remain equal to the Jesuits, the Church opened many schools that taught laymen to sing and read neumes. They borrowed from Serbian, Bulgarian, and other Orthodox chants and standardized both the notation and teaching method, mixing them together to form a distinctive Kyivan chant style. Eventually, during the Polish Renaissance, the Kyivan Orthodox Church fully adopted the polyphonic styles popular at the time. They retained the Znamenny chant, 8 echoi (glassy, melodically-based Orthodox modes based upon the Byzantine idea), and scale, but adopted the descant style of their Catholic counterparts. The notation also changed to a 5-line staff (unlike the contemporary 4-line staff) with square note heads.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, pages 223-230 The 17th century was marked by reforms. The chant had grown incredibly cumbersome and bulky, and various Metropolitans attempted to rein the system in. Shaidur was the first, and in 1600 he created a notation that clearly demonstrated the starting pitch of each chant, known as the Shaidurov marking. Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich and Patriarch Nikon patronized the Southwestern style of chant over the Muscovite, adopted both the Jesuit model of education, imported singers from Kyiv, and replaced the Znamenny chant with the gestalt used in the Southwest.Joan L. Roccasalvo, The Znamenny Chant. The Musical Quarterly , Vol. 74, No. 2 (1990), pp.217-241, page 228 During Alexei‚Äôs reign, the Znamenny chant was driven out of popular use. Over the beginning of the 18th century, the church services grew more Catholic, with the permanent institution of church choirs instead of laity to sing, and the institution of a musical Ordinary, set polyphonically in the Italian style and drawn from the modernized chant and folk songs, called Obychny.Alfred J. Swan, Harmonization of the Old Rus'ian Chants. Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 2, No. 2 (1949), pp. 83-86 The use of choral concertos - short unaccompanied choral compositions, intended for performance in breaks in the liturgy when clergy were taking Holy Communion, was also popular from the mid-seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries.

She invented the Illusion Transmitter, for which she received a patent in 1980. She was responsible for developing the digital media formats image processing systems used in the early years of the Landsat program.  Early life and education  Valerie Thomas was interested in science as a child, after observing her father tinkering with the television and seeing the mechanical parts inside the TV. At the age of eight, she read The Boys First Book on Electronics, which sparked her interest in a career in science. Her father would not help her with the projects in the book, despite his own interest in electronics. At the all-girls school she attended, she was not encouraged to pursue science and mathematics courses, though she did manage to take a physics course. Valerie did not have a lot of support as a young child. While her parents and her school teacher did not fight for her right to study for the STEM. But, she did have a few teachers who fought for her at young age. She would go on to attend Morgan State University, where she was one of two women majoring in physics. Thomas excelled in her mathematics and science courses at Morgan State University and after graduating with a degree in physics went on to work for NASA. In 1976 she attended a scientific seminar where she viewed an exhibit that demonstrated an illusion. The exhibit used concave mirrors to fool the viewer into believing that a light bulb was glowing even after it had been unscrewed from its socket. She was so amazed by what she saw at this seminar that she wanted to start creating this on her own. Later that year she would begin to experiment with mirrors. These mirrors would be flat or concave. The flat mirrors would have a reflection on a certain object that would seem to be behind the glass. The concave mirror would have a reflection that would actually be in front of the glass and you would then see a three dimensional illusion. Career In 1964, Thomas began working for NASA as a data analyst. She developed real-time computer data systems to support satellite operations control centers (1964‚Äì1970) and oversaw the creation of the Landsat program (1970‚Äì1981), becoming an international expert in Landsat data products. In 1974 Thomas headed a team of approximately 50 people for the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE), a joint effort with NASA's Johnson Space Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. LACIE demonstrated the feasibility of using space technology to automate the process of predicting wheat yield on a worldwide basis. In 1976, she attended an exhibition that included an illusion of a light bulb that was lit, even though it had been removed from its socket. The illusion, which involved another light bulb and concave mirrors, inspired Thomas. Curious about how light and concave mirrors could be used in her work at NASA, she began her research in 1977. This involved creating an experiment in which she observed how the position of a concave mirror would affect the real object that it reflected. Using this technology, she would invent the illusion transmitter. On October 21, 1980, she obtained the patent for the illusion transmitter, a device that NASA continues to use today. As a woman and an African American, Ms. Thomas worked her way up to associate chief of the Space Science Data Operations Office at NASA. In 1985, she was the NSSDC Computer Facility manager responsible for a major consolidation and reconfiguration of two previously independent computer facilities and infused it with new technology. She then served as the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) project manager from 1986‚Äì1990 during a period when SPAN underwent a major reconfiguration and grew from a scientific network with about 100 computer nodes to one directly connecting about 2,700 computer nodes worldwide. In 1990, SPAN became a major part of NASA's science networking and today's Internet. She also participated in projects related to Halley's Comet, ozone research, satellite technology and the Voyager spacecraft. At the end of August 1995, she retired from NASA and her positions of associate chief of NASA's Space Science Data Operations Office, manager of the NASA Automated Systems Incident Response Capability and as chair of the Space Science Data Operations Office Education Committee. Post-retirement, Valerie Thomas served as an associate at the UMBC Center for Multicore Hybrid Productivity Research. She continued to serve as a mentor for youth through the Science Mathematics Aerospace Research and Technology and National Technical Association. Valerie's invention showed up in a children's fictional book and would then be seen on television and video games.  Notable Achievements  Throughout her career, Thomas held high level positions at NASA including heading the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE) collaboration between NASA, NOAA, and USDA in 1974, serving as assistant program manager for Landast/Nimbus (1975-1976), managing the NSSDC Computer Facility (1985), managing the Space Physics Analysis Network project (1986-1990), and serving as associate chief of the Space Science Data Operations Office. She authored many scientific papers and holds a patent for the illusion transmitter. For her achievements, Thomas has received numerous awards including the Goddard Space Flight Center Award of Merit and NASA's Equal Opportunity Medal. She had mentored countless students and youth through the Goddard Space Flight Center, National Tehnical Association, Women in Science and Engineering, and the National Technical Association and Science Mathematics Aerospace Research and Technology Inc program.

Background  It is not known when Wang Ke was born. His biological father Wang Chongjian (ÁéãÈáçÁ∞°) was an older brother to Wang Chongrong, who would become a powerful warlord as the military governor of Huguo. As Wang Chongrong was sonless, he adopted Wang Ke as his own son. (Wang Ke's cousins Wang Gong and Wang Yao (ÁéãÁë§) would later accuse Wang Ke of not being actually Wang blood but a servant in origin, but that accusation did not appear reliable even in contemporary times.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 14. After Wang Chongrong was assassinated by his officer Chang Xingru (Â∏∏Ë°åÂÑí) in 887, then-reigning Emperor Xizong commissioned another older brother of Wang Chongrong's, Wang Chongying (Wang Gong's and Wang Yao's father), who was then the military governor of neighboring Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) as the new military governor of Huguo, while making Wang Gong the acting military governor of ShanguoZizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. (and later, full military governor) and Wang Ke the commander of the armed forces (Ë°åËªçÂè∏È¶¨, Xingjun Sima) at Huguo. In spring 895, Wang Chongying died. The soldiers at Huguo supported Wang Ke to be the acting military governor. However, Wang Gong, then still the military governor of Shanguo (which had been renamed Baoyi at that point), and Wang Yao, then the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng) objected, and they claimed that Wang Ke was not actually of Wang blood. At Wang Gong's and Wang Yao's urging, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong initially commissioned the chancellor Cui Yin to be the military governor of Huguo. However, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), whose daughter was contracted to marry Wang Ke, submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong supporting Wang Ke, and Emperor Zhaozong subsequently agreed to commission Wang Ke military governor. When Wang Gong's allies Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) submitted a contrary proposal ‚Äî to have Wang Gong made the military governor of Huguo and Wang Ke the military governor of Baoyi ‚Äî Emperor Zhaozong rejected on the basis that he had already accepted Li Keyong's proposal.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Emperor Zhaozong's rejection of Li Maozhen's, Wang Xingyu's, and Han Jian's proposal brought a violent reaction from them, who marched on the imperial capital Chang'an and killed the chancellors Li Xi and Wei Zhaodu; they subsequently forced Emperor Zhaozong to issue a new edict moving Wang Gong to Huguo, Wang Xingyu's brother Wang Xingyue (ÁéãË°åÁ¥Ñ) from Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, also headquartered in modern Weinan) to Baoyi, and Wang Ke to Kuangguo. Meanwhile, Wang Xingyue was attacking Huguo, and Wang Ke sought aid from Li Keyong. Li Keyong, denouncing Li Maozhen, Wang Xingyu, and Han for killing Li Xi and Wei, marched south. When Wang Yao tried to block his path, he captured Jiang Prefecture and executed Wang Yao, and subsequently arrived at Huguo to rendezvous with Wang Ke. He then proceeded toward Jingnan. By the end of the year, Wang Xingyu had been defeated and was killed by his own subordinates in flight; Li Maozhen and Han were forced to sue for peace. Emperor Zhaozong then officially commissioned Wang Ke military governor of Huguo.  As military governor  In 896, Emperor Zhaozong gave Wang Ke the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). In 897, Wang Gong attacked Wang Ke. Wang Ke sought aid from Li Keyong, while Wang Gong sought aid from Li Keyong's archenemy Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit. The Xuanwu forces, commanded by Zhu's generals Zhang Cunjing (ÂºµÂ≠òÊï¨) and Yang Shihou, were initially successful against Huguo forces, but the Hedong relief forces, commanded by Li Keyong's nephew Li Sizhao, then defeated Baoyi forces and lifted the siege against Huguo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 898, Wang Ke went to Hedong's capital Taiyuan to personally marry Li Keyong's daughter. During his absence from Huguo, Li Sizhao defended the circuit. Later in the year, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) on him. Later in 898, the Baoyi and Xuanwu forces again attacked Huguo; when Wang Ke sought aid from Hedong, Li Sizhao repelled the Baoyi and Xuanwu forces. In late 900, Emperor Zhaozong was briefly deposed by a group of powerful eunuchs led by Liu Jishu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Wang Ke, when receiving the news, was incensed at the eunuchs, but before he could launch an army against them, Emperor Zhaozong was restored in a countercoup. Hearing of the emperor's restoration, Wang Ke was the first among military governors to submit tributes to the restored emperor, drawing imperial favor for him.New Book of Tang, vol. 187.  Defeat and death  Meanwhile, though, the bad blood between Wang Ke and Zhu Quanzhong continued to develop. In particular, after Zhu made a major attack on Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) but was repelled by Yang, he persuaded Qian Liu the military governor of Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) and Zhendong (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) Circuits, Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), Du Hong the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), and Wang Shifan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) to accuse Yang of aggression against them and request Emperor Zhaozong to appoint Zhu the commander of an operation against Yang. Wang Ke reacted by jointly submitting a petition with Li Keyong, Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Wang Gao the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) accusing Zhu of aggression against them and asking that Yang be appointed the commander of an operation against Zhu. This allowed Emperor Zhaozong to decline both petitions. Meanwhile, by 901, Li Keyong had suffered defeats that caused his strength to wane, allowing Zhu to start reconsider another campaign to conquer Wang Ke's domain as a step in ultimately defeating Li Keyong. He stated to his generals: Zhu then launched his attack, with he himself heading toward Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality (Ê≤≥‰∏≠), while sending Zhang Cunjing to attack Jin (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and Jiang Prefectures to cut off any path of aid that Li Keyong might send. Jin and Jiang Prefectures were caught by surprise, and their prefects, Tao Jianzhao (Èô∂Âª∫Èáó) and Zhang Hanyu (ÂºµÊº¢Áëú) quickly surrendered, allowing Zhu to cut off communications between Hezhong and Hedong Circuit. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhaozong, receiving words of the attack, tried to intervene by issuing an edict calling for peaceful resolution; Zhu ignored the edict. Li Keyong, receiving repeated calls for help from Wang Ke and Wang Ke's wife Lady Li but hearing that the Jin/Jiang path had been cut off, did not launch a relief force; instead, he suggested to Wang Ke that he abandon Huguo and flee to Chang'an. Wang Ke also sent request to Li Maozhen for aid, offering that, if Li Maozhen could repel Zhu, he would offer Huguo to Li Maozhen. Li Maozhen did not respond. Unable to withstand Zhu's attack, Wang Ke tried to flee across the Yellow River toward Chang'an, but it happened that the bridge across the Yellow River was unusable at that time due to ice damage. With the morale of his troops low, Wang Ke decided to surrender. Trying to appease the Huguo people, Zhu declined Wang Ke's offer of surrendering in a ceremony in which Wang Ke, as the defeated, would bare his upper body, bind his own hands, and bring sheep out of the city; rather, under Zhu's direction, Wang Ke exited the city in full formal clothing, and was referred to as \\"Master\\" by Zhu. (Zhu had previously honored Wang Chongrong as an uncle because Wang Chongrong had been the one accepting his allegiance to Tang when he turned against the agrarian rebel Huang Chao and surrendered to Tang, and because Zhu's mother was surnamed Wang as well.) After Wang Ke's surrender, Zhu commissioned Zhang as the acting military governor of Huguo, while relocating Wang Ke and his family to Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û). However, Zhu continued to be suspicious of Wang Ke due to Wang Ke's marriage to Li Keyong's daughter.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 42. He therefore sent Wang Ke on a journey to Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor, but sent assassins to kill Wang when he reached Zhenguo.

It was the Italian Republic's first Government of Experts, entirely composed of experts and officials from outside Parliament.

The new government, composed only of independents, was supported by the Democratic Party of the Left, Northern League, Italian People's Party, Greens, Segni Pact, Democratic Alliance, Italian Socialists and The Network. The parties of the Pole (Forza Italia National Alliance and Christian Democratic Centre) announced the intention to abstain from the vote of confidence, while the Communist Refoundation Party voted against. After the split of the United Christian Democrats from the Italian People's Party, the government lost the majority to the Chamber of Deputies. On 19 October 1995, the Senate approved a motion of individual mistrust towards the Minister of Justice Filippo Mancuso, presented by the groups of the majority and endorsed by the Prime Minister. In May 1995 Mancuso had accused the methods used in the Mani Pulite investigation and asked for disciplinary action against the pool of magistrates who had carried out the investigations. On 30 December 1995 Lamberto Dini resigned, since the programmatic goals on which the government had gained confidence had been achieved. On 1st February 1996 Scalfaro conferred the task for the formation of the new government to Antonio Maccanico, who accepted with reserve. However Maccanico dissolved the reserve, unable to find a parliamentary majority, putting the mandate in the hands of the President of the Republic. On 16 February 1996, Scalfaro therefore decreed the dissolution of the Chambers.

Also known as National Postgraduate Entrance Examination (NPEE) () or Chinese abbreviation Kaoyan (). Same as National College Entrance Examination (NCEE, NME or NHEEE) which is meant for undergraduate level study, NPEE is an academic examination held annually in People's Republic of China. It is a prerequisite for college undergraduates to entrance the higher education institutions. NPEE is usually taken by students during their last year of universities. Also, student with bachelor's degree and age below 40 can participate in NPEE. NPEE takes place in the first Saturday and Sunday before 23 December in lunar calendar (usually in January). So NPEE will be held in the first semester of undergraduates' last year of universities (not like NCEE, which is held on 7th and 8th in June, the end of the second semester of high school students' last year). Also, such rule can cause the NPEE to be held twice a year (although it is an annual examination), for example, the 2014 and 2015 NPEE were both held in year 2014, took place on Jan. 4-6 and Dec. 27-29 respectively.  Subjects of NPEE  NPEE usually includes a preliminary test and a re-examination. This paper's main discussion is the preliminary test. Usually, there are 4 subjects for the preliminary test. 2 of them are examinations for specialized courses, 1 for foreign language, and 1 for politics. The specific subject of specialized courses depends on the major students applied. It includes Advanced Mathematics, Physical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Chemistry Engineering Principle, Translation and Writing and so on. The re-examination may contains written examination and interview. Usually, it examine the specialized knowledge and skills. = The Advanced Mathematics Examination of NPEE = The Advanced Mathematics (Adv. Math) examination is one of those specialized courses. The Advanced Mathematics in NPEE includes many editions. Includes Advanced Mathematics I for Science majors, Advanced Mathematics II for Engineering majors, Advanced Mathematics III for Economic and Finance majors, Agricultural Advanced Mathematics for Agriculture majors and other Mathematics test proposed by the institutions students applied. Those 4 kinds of Advanced Mathematics examinations (Adv. Math I/II/III and Agricultural Adv. Math) are all proposed by the Ministry of Education. Not like the NCEE, all candidates of China mainland that need to complete the Adv. Math examination will get the same paper, there are no differences between different provinces. Different major or different institutions may select different Adv. Math papers, even not same as anyone of those 4 kinds before. It means that students apply for some majors of some institutions may get papers written by the institutions they applied for, not proposed by the Ministry of Education. = The Foreign Language Examination of NPEE = The foreign language in NPEE contains English, Russian, Japanese, French, German and so on. English, Russian and Japanese examinations are unified examinations. It depends on the majors and institutions students chose. The English examination has 2 editions: English I and English II. They are different, usually, English II is easier than English I. The candidates applying for academic masters will all take the English I, however, some of the candidates applying for professional masters will take English II. English I and II tests are all proposed by the Ministry of Education and students in different provinces of China mainland will get same papers. = The Political Examination of the NPEE = Politics is a required subject for almost all students who take part in the NPEE. Although there are many controversies on it, it is regarded as an effective method to make sure the senior intellectuals of mainland China are loyal to the Central Government and ultimately to the Communist Party of China. The Political Examination is based on 4 courses that students learn during their undergraduate studies. The courses are \\"Ideology, Morality and Basics of Law\\", \\"Introduction to the basic principle of Marxism\\", \\"Outline of Modern Chinese History\\" and \\"Introduction to Maoism and Theorical System of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\\".

It uses end- to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Cryptocat users. Users are given the option of independently verifying their buddies' device lists and are notified when a buddy's device list is modified and all updates are verified through the built-in update downloader. Cryptocat was created by Nadim Kobeissi and further developed along with a community of open source contributors and is published under the terms of the GPLv3 license, although it has since been discontinued. History Cryptocat was first launched on 19 May 2011 as a web application. In June 2012, Kobeissi said he was detained at the U.S. border by the DHS and questioned about Cryptocat's censorship resistance. He tweeted about the incident afterwards, resulting in media coverage and a spike in the popularity of the software. In June 2013, security researcher Steve Thomas pointed out a security bug that could be used to decrypt any group chat message that had taken place using Cryptocat between September 2012 and 19 April 2013. Private messages were not affected, and the bug had been resolved a month prior. In response, Cryptocat issued a security advisory, requested that all users ensure that they had upgraded, and informed users that past group conversations may have been compromised. In February 2014, an audit by iSec Partners criticized Cryptocat's authentication model as insufficient.https://isecpartners.github.io/publications/iSEC_Cryptocat_iOS.pdf In response, Cryptocat made improvements to user authentication, making it easier for users to authenticate and detect man-in-the-middle attacks. In February 2016, citing dissatisfaction with the project's current state after 19 months of non-maintenance, Kobeissi announced that he would be taking Cryptocat temporarily offline and discontinuing the development of its mobile application, pending a complete rewrite and relaunch of the software. In March 2016 Kobeissi announced the re-release of Cryptocat, rewritten completely as desktop software instead of the original web application software, as a public beta and the resumption of the service. The new desktop-centric approach allowed Cryptocat to benefit from stronger desktop integration, in a style similar to Pidgin. In February 2019, it was announced that Cryptocat would be discontinued. As of December 2019, the cryptocat domain is for sale and links to the site for the Wire messenger. Features Cryptocat allows its users to set up end-to-end encrypted chat conversations. Users can exchange one-to-one messages, encrypted files, photos as well as create and share audio/video recordings. All devices linked to Cryptocat accounts will receive forward secure messages, even when offline. All messages, files and audio/video recordings sent over Cryptocat are end-to-end encrypted. Cryptocat users link their devices to their Cryptocat account upon connection, and can identify each other's devices via the client's device manager in order to prevent man- in-the-middle attacks. Cryptocat also employs a Trust on first use mechanism in order to help detect device identity key changes. Cryptocat also includes a built-in auto-update mechanism that automatically performs a signature check on downloaded updates in order to verify authenticity, and employs TLS certificate pinning in order to prevent network impersonation attacks. Originally in 2013, Cryptocat offered the ability to connect to Facebook Messenger to initiate encrypted chatting with other Cryptocat users. According to the developers, the feature was meant to help offer an alternative to the regular Cryptocat chat model which did not offer long-term contact lists. This feature was disconnected in November 2015. Reception and usage In June 2013, Cryptocat was used by journalist Glenn Greenwald while in Hong Kong to meet NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for the first time, after other encryption software failed to work. In November 2013, Cryptocat was banned in Iran, shortly after the election of Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani who had promised more open Internet laws. Cryptocat was listed on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \\"Secure Messaging Scorecard\\" from 4 November 2014 until 13 March 2016. During that time, Cryptocat had a score of 7 out of 7 points on the scorecard. It had received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider did not have access to (end-to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent's identities, having past communications secure if the keys were stolen (forward secrecy), having its code open to independent review (open-source), having its security designs well-documented, and having completed an independent security audit. Architecture =Encryption= Cryptocat uses a Double Ratchet Algorithm in order to obtain forward and future secrecy across messages, after a session is established using a four-way Elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman handshake. The handshake mixes in long-term identity keys, an intermediate-term signed pre- key, and a one-time use prekey. The approach is similar to the encryption protocol adopted for encrypted messaging by the Signal mobile application. Cryptocat's goal is for its messages to obtain confidentiality, integrity, source authenticity, forward and future secrecy and indistinguishability even over a network controlled by an active attacker. The forward secrecy features of the protocol that Cryptocat uses are similar to those first introduced by Off-the-Record Messaging. Cryptocat uses the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode for authenticated encryption, Curve25519 for Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman shared secret agreement, HMAC-SHA256 for key derivation and Ed25519 for signing. In order to limit the effect of a long-term identity key compromise, long-term keys are used exclusively once for the initial Authenticated Key Exchange, and once for signing a newly generated intermediate-term signed prekey. For the transport layer, Cryptocat adopts the OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption standard, which also gives Cryptocat multi-device support and allows for offline messaging. =Network= Cryptocat's network relies on a XMPP configuration served over WebSockets. According to the project's mission statement, Cryptocat's network only relays encrypted messages and does not store any data. In addition to the Cryptocat client's end-to-end encryption protocol, client-server communication is protected by TLS. Distribution From March 2011 until March 2016, Cryptocat was officially distributed through the Google Chrome Web Store, the Apple App Store and other official channels controlled by targeted platforms. After Cryptocat's re-write into desktop software in March 2016, the software became distributed exclusively through Cryptocat's own servers, which also handle signed update delivery.

Built soon after and in commemoration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, it is the seat of the Romanian Orthodox Archdiocese of Alba Iulia. Background The cathedral and surrounding buildings were raised in the western part of the Alba Iulia Citadel, on the site of a gatehouse near the Roman Plateau. It was thought of as a continuation of the former metropolitan seat at Alba Iulia (then called BƒÉlgrad), where Michael the Brave built a stone church in 1597. When the citadel was rebuilt in its current form in 1713‚Äì1714, the Habsburg authorities demolished this and its materials were used to build a new church near where the railway station is today. A wooden memorial church in the southeastern part of the citadel marks the site of the former metropolitan cathedral. \\"Catedrala ArhiepiscopalƒÉ OrtodoxƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ din Alba Iulia\\" at the Romanian Orthodox Archdiocese of Alba Iulia site; accessed November 13, 2011 Built in 1921‚Äì1922, the cathedral was ready in time for the coronation of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie as monarchs of Greater Romania on October 15, 1922. This event, which took place in the same city where the Union of Transylvania with Romania occurred on December 1, 1918, was meant to give the union added symbolic and religious weight.

BƒÉie»õan, \\"Alba Iulia ‚Äì Ora≈üul ≈üi Monumentele sale\\" at the Association of Localities and Historic Art Zones of Romania site; accessed November 13, 2011 Ferdinand, a Roman Catholic, objected to being crowned inside an Orthodox church, so the coronation ceremony was held outside in the courtyard. \\"Visiting the Coronation Cathedral\\" at the Alba Iulia City Hall's Visit Alba Iulia site; accessed February 8, 2017 In commemoration of the event, busts of the king and queen were placed on the grounds in 2008. Architecture The cathedral forms part of a group of buildings erected beginning in the late 19th century in the national style promoted by Ion Mincu and Petre Antonescu, incorporating traditional forms of Romanian architecture, in particular the Br√¢ncovenesc style, and adapting them to modern tastes. The plan, an inscribed Greek cross, draws upon the T√¢rgovi≈üte Princely Church. Similarly, the exterior decorative elements, such as niches, beads about the column capitals and arcades, as well as the domes, resemble those found in Wallachian churches from the time of Matei Basarab and Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu. The interior fresco painting, by Costin Petrescu and his apprentices, follows the dictates of traditional Byzantine Orthodox iconography while exhibiting Western influences. The entrance to the building has an open porch with large arches supported by columns with capitals. The portal is decorated with traditional motifs, and above it are mosaic icons of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, while one side of the entrance has icons of Saints Peter and Paul and the other of Kings David and Solomon. The porch's niches have marble plates commemorating four events: Metropolitan Simion ≈ûtefan printing the first Romanian-language New Testament in 1648; the union of the three Romanian principalities achieved by Michael the Brave in 1600; the execution of Horea, Clo≈üca and Cri≈üan in 1785; and the merger of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church into the Orthodox Church in 1948, an act forced by the new Communist regime, supported at the time by the Orthodox Church but denounced as unlawful by Greek-Catholics.Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu, Religion and Politics in Post-communist Romania, p. 92. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007. . Also during that period, the authorities had the edifice's name changed to CatedralƒÉ Re√Æntregirii Neamului (\\"Cathedral of the Unity of the People\\") in order to minimize associations with the abolished monarchy, but the \\"Coronation Cathedral\\" name staged somewhat of a comeback following the 1989 fall of the regime.

Paintings of the ktitor of the first metropolitan church in BƒÉlgrad, Michael the Brave, and of his wife Lady Stanca appear in the narthex. The tall nave is dominated by a cupola painted with the image of Christ Pantocrator and held up by four octagonal columns coated in Moneasa marble. The western wall of the nave has paintings of clerics from the time when the cathedral was built: Nicolae BƒÉlan, Metropolitan of Transylvania, and Miron Cristea, Patriarch of All Romania, as well as votive portraits of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie. The altar apse is painted with the Theotokos and scenes from the Bible. There are three octagonal spires, each lighted by eight windows, with an onion dome roof and a metal cross on top. In front of the carved and painted oak iconostasis and adjacent to the triumphal arch, there are large portraits of former Metropolitans of Transylvania Ilie Iorest and Sava Brancovici, as well as of the monks Visarion Sarai and Sofronie of Cioara, and the martyr Oprea MiclƒÉu≈ü of SƒÉli≈üte, all of whom were canonized in the cathedral in 1955. A pair of thrones inscribed with royal symbols was placed beside the iconostasis during the solemn coronation service. In addition to the iconostasis, the furniture and choir are also oak and decorated with Br√¢ncovenesc motifs. \\"Catedrala ArhiepiscopalƒÉ din Alba Iulia (Re√Æntregirii Neamului)\\" at the Alba County Directorate for Culture, Religious Affairs and National Cultural Patrimony site; accessed November 14, 2011 The cathedral lies on a rectangular lot which has four pavilions, one in each corner, linked by galleries that recall those found in monasteries, formed of open double arcades held up by columns. Some of the columns have Corinthian capitals with Br√¢ncovenesc touches. The larger, eastern pavilions house the archdiocesan residence and administration. The smaller, western ones are used by those who run the building and grounds. The 58 m-high bell tower, with the entrance to the complex beneath it, lies between the western pavilions. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Alba Iulia, which has held this rank since 1998, having previously been a diocese since 1975. The building was renovated in 1993, the 75th anniversary of the 1918 Union.

The song chronicles the Easter Rising of 1916, and encourages Irishmen to fight for the cause of Ireland, rather than for the British Empire, as so many young men were doing in World War I. Early title \\"The Foggy Dew\\" as the name of an Irish traditional song first appears in Edward Bunting's The Ancient Music of Ireland (1840),Bunting, Edward: The Ancient Music of Ireland (Dublin: Hodges & Smith, 1840), tune no. 150, p. 109; facsimile reprint, Dublin: Waltons, 1969. where the tune is different from that mostly sung today (also different from the lament and the rebel song below). Bunting's source for the tune was a \\"J. Mc Knight, Belfast, 1839\\", but the same melody already appears in O'Farrell's Collection of National Irish Music for the Union Pipes (London, 1804), where it is called \\"Corraga Bawn\\".Fleischmann, Aloys (ed.): Sources of Irish Traditional Music c.1600‚Äì1855, 2 volumes (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), , vol. 2, p. 717 and 1106, tunes no. 3913 and 6068. Easter Rising Another song called \\"Foggy Dew\\" was written by Fr (later in life) Canon Charles O‚ÄôNeill from Portglenone, County Antrim (1887‚Äì1963), a priest of the Diocese of Down and Connor who was then a curate at St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast and later in life was parish priest of Kilcoo and later Newcastle, County Down. .Down & Connor Diocesan Archives in Belfast, record for Father Charles O'Neill. O'Neill was ordained in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1912. https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002318/19630520/025/0002 The music is from a manuscript that was in possession of Kathleen Dallat, sister of Michael Dallat of Ballycastle. That manuscript gives Carl Hardebeck as the arranger. It is the same air as the traditional love song The Moorlough Shore. \\"The Foggy Dew\\" is a product of the political situation in Ireland in the aftermath of the Easter Rising and World War I. Approximately 210,000 Irishmen joined up and served in the British forces during the war.Keith Jeffery. Ireland and the Great War. (Cambridge University Press, 2000) This created mixed feelings for many Irish people, particularly for those with nationalist sympathies. While they broadly supported the British war effort, they also felt that one of the moral justifications for the war, \\"the freedom of small nations\\" like Belgium and Serbia, should also be applied to Ireland, which at that time was under British rule. The 1915 Gallipoli slaughter of the young and mainly middle-class Irishmen who had joined up in response to John Redmond's call turned many people against the war. In 1916, Irish patriots led by James Connolly and Patrick Pearse, taking advantage of Britain being occupied by World War I, seized some of the major buildings in Dublin including the General Post Office, while others came out in Ashbourne and Galway in the Easter Rising. The brutal response to the Rising, and the execution of its leaders that followed, marked a turning point for many Irish people. The public revulsion at the executions added to the growing sense of alienation from the British Government. Canon O'Neill reflected this alienation when he wrote The Foggy Dew commemorating the few hundred brave men who had risen out against what was then the most powerful empire in the world. In 1919, he attended the first sitting of the new Irish Parliament, D√°il. The names of the elected members were called out, but many were absent. Their names were answered by the reply faoi ghlas ag na Gaill ‚Äì \\"locked up by the foreigner\\". These events had a profound effect on O'Neill and some time after this he wrote The Foggy Dew telling the story of the Easter Rising and reflecting the thoughts of many Irish people at the time who now believed that the Irishmen who fought for Britain during the war should have stayed home and fought for Irish independence instead. O'Neill sums up this feeling in the line ‚ÄòTwas far better to die ‚Äòneath an Irish sky, Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar. =Recording artists= The song (also sometimes known as Down the Glen) has been performed and recorded by most Irish traditional groups, including The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Dubliners, The Chieftains, Shane MacGowan and the Wolfe Tones among others. *Sin√©ad O'Connor provided the vocals for a mournful version of the song on the Chieftains' 1995 collaboration album The Long Black Veil which was voted Best Duet by BBC Radio 6 Music.

Harrison began his service as captain and was promoted to major in early 1862. He fought with the regiment at the Battle of Shiloh, Siege of Corinth and Battle of Perryville. Harrison became colonel of the regiment on November 18, 1862, about six weeks before the Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro, Tennessee) and led the regiment at that battle.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published New York, McKay, 1959. p. 379 Harrison was wounded in the hip on January 1, 1863 at Stones River. He subsequently led the regiment during the Tullahoma Campaign. Between July 1863 and April 26, 1865, Harrison commanded cavalry brigades in the divisions of Brigadier General John A. Wharton (including Major General William T. Martin's detachment), Brigadier General Frank Crawford Armstrong and Brigadier General William Y.C. Humes in Major General Joseph Wheeler's Cavalry Corps of the Army of Tennessee and the Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. His regiment and brigade often were used as scouts. Harrison fought under the command of Cavalry Corps commander Major General Joseph Wheeler at the Battle of Chickamauga and in the Knoxville Campaign, Atlanta campaign, Savannah Campaign (Sherman's March to the Sea) and the Carolinas Campaign.Boatner, p. 379, states Harrison went with General John Bell Hood to Tennessee for the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign. This is inconsistent with other sources and with the fact that Wheeler's cavalry corps remained in Georgia to oppose Sherman's march to the sea. Despite being in brigade command for a considerable period of time, Harrison was not appointed as a brigadier general until near the end of the war, February 18, 1865, to rank from January 14, 1865.United States War Department, The Military Secretary's Office, Memorandum relative to the general officers appointed by the President in the armies of the Confederate States--1861-1865 (1908) (Compiled from official records) Caption shows 1905 but printing date is February 11, 1908.

Anderson's division in Lieutenant General Wade Hampton's (his second cousin) cavalry corps during the Carolinas Campaign. Harrison was wounded at the Battle of Monroe's Crossroads in North Carolina on March 10, 1865. He was paroled at Macon, Georgia on May 31, 1865 and pardoned on March 29, 1866. Aftermath Harrison returned to Waco after the end of the war. He was elected district judge. He became an anti-Reconstruction Democrat. He was a Democratic Party Presidential Elector in 1872.

They competed in numerous regional and independent promotions throughout the Southern United States in the 1990s, and were arguably one of the region's top \\"heel\\" teams during this period. In their seven years as a team, Parker and Anderson competed in Atlantic Coast Championship Wrestling, Cueball Carmichael's Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance, National Wrestling Alliance, North American Wrestling Association, OMEGA, Southern Championship Wrestling, Southern States Wrestling, Virginia Championship Wrestling, and the United States Wrestling Association. They also occasionally appeared in the World Wrestling Federation during the \\"Attitude Era\\". The two men won numerous tag titles and, among their list of accomplishments, were the first-ever IPWA Tag Team Champions, winning the title a record 3-times, former SCW Tag Team Champions, and 8-time SSW Tag Team Champions. They were also the first and longest reigning VCW Tag Team Champions, defending the belts for more than two years, and the last NWA National Tag Team Champions before the title was retired in 1997. They also gained notoriety on the Southern independents feuding with the likes of The Batten Twins (Brad and Bart Batten), Serial Thrillaz (Shane Helms and Mike Maverick), Thug Life (Christian Cage and Sexton Hardcastle), The Fantastic Express (Ricky Morton and Bobby Fulton), and The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson).\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated.

History =Early years= Frank Parker and Roger Anderson first met while competing with Jimmy Valiant in local independent promotions in Virginia, such as Mike Sampson's United Wrestling Association, in the summer of 1994. Initially brought together by Valiant, Parker's former trainer, the two men began teaming as \\"Death & Destruction\\" on the Southeastern independent circuit the following year. =Southern States Wrestling (1995‚Äì1996)= By mid-1995, Death & Destruction had made their debut in Tennessee's Southern States Wrestling. They quickly captured the promotion's tag team championship from The Young Guns (Scott Sterling and Jeff Lovin) in Fall Branch on September 4, 1995. Their first championship reign lasted over three months until their defeat by Beau James and Dan Cooley on December 1, 1995. Although they regained it in Princeton, West Virginia the following night, the team dropped the belts to Beau James and Ricky Morton a week later in Ledger, North Carolina. Their third reign started after beating The Beautiful Blondes (Eddie Golden and Stan Lee) in Fall Branch on February 16, 1996. They traded the belts with The Fantastic Express (Ricky Morton and Bobby Fulton) in Johnson City, Tennessee during the spring before eventually losing the titles to Scott Sterling and Dan Cooley on September 2, 1996. =Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance (1996‚Äì1997)= Earlier that year, Death & Destruction began wrestling for Cueball Carmichael's Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance in Alexandria, Virginia. They became the first-ever IPWA Tag Team Champions, defeating the American Patriot and Kevin Dillon, on the promotions's first show in Manassas on March 9, 1996. They would go on to win the tag team titles a record 3-times during their 15 months in the IPWA. That summer, Wahoo McDaniel came out of retirement to team with \\"Beastmaster\\" Rick Link against Parker and Anderson at an ACW show in North Carolina.Apter, Bill. \\"Ringside.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (August 1996): pg. 64. Their loss to MEWF Tag Team Champions Darkside (Glen Osbourne and Rockin' Rebel) in a \\"champions vs. champions\\", occurring during the team's second run as champions, saw Darkside win both the IPWA and MEWF titles. Death & Destruction's third and final reign began following their victory over Steve Corino and Adam Flash on March 22, 1997, in Goldsboro, North Carolina and lasted until the championship became vacated that summer. It was around this time that Parker and Anderson won the briefly revived NWA National Tag Team Championship before it was retired that same year.Goodman, Larry. \\"5/7 Mark Curtis Memorial show report.\\" DeclarationofIndependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., May. 2005. Web. 5 October 2011. . A few months later, while working for Virginia Championship Wrestling, they also became the promotion's first tag team champions and held the titles over two years. =Southern Championship Wrestling (1997‚Äì1998)= Parker and Anderson spent much of 1997 in Southern Championship Wrestling with manager Count Grog where they feuded with Serial Thrillaz (Shane Helms and Mike Maverick) and Thug Life (Christian Cage and Sexton Hardcastle). On June 14, 1997, they won the SCW Tag Team Titles from C.W. Anderson and David Dawson (substituting for Pat Anderson) in Butner, North Carolina and lost the belts to Northern Exposure (C.W. Anderson and Cueball Carmichael) in Louisburg in the fall. On August 15, 1997, Death & Destruction lost to \\"Raging Bull\\" Manny Fernandez and Victor Steamboat at the IWA Night of Legends show in Kannapolis, North Carolina. Death & Destruction also received a tryout match for the World Wrestling Federation at the end of the year. Their first WWF appearance saw them take on The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) on the December 6th 1997 edition Shotgun Saturday Night which ended in a double-countout. The team's name was not used, with Anderson wrestling as \\"Roger Hill\\", however color commentator Jim Cornette made a hidden reference to their independent work when, during the match, he commented that \\"the LOD [are] destroying their opponents so badly, they might as well call them death and destruction.\\" =Southern States Wrestling (1997‚Äì1998)= Back in SSW, Death & Destruction continued to dominate the tag team division. On July 4, 1997, they defeated Beau James and War Machine in Fall Branch, Tennessee for the SSW Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles to Beau James and a new partner, K.C. Thunder, at an October 18 show in Mountain City, Tennessee. The team won them back on December 19, 1997, and spent another three months as champions before losing the titles to Mike Cooper and Super Masked Man in Fall Branch on March 20, 1998. =Independent circuit (1998‚Äì1999)= By the late 1990s, Death & Destruction had established themselves as one of the top tag teams in the Southern independents and were most active in eastern Tennessee, Virginia and the Carolinas.Lane, Matthew. \\"Southern States Wrestling Friday Nov 13, Kingsport, TN.\\" DeclarationofIndependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., 2009. Web. 5 October 2011. . Fans appreciated their hard-hitting style and adherence to traditional Southern-style 'Rasslin' reminiscent of the bygone territory-era. Dean Rasmussen, editor-in-chief of Death Valley Driver Video Review, put them in a class of modern-day Southern brawlers such as C.W. Anderson and Eddie Golden. DVDVR also listed both Parker (118) and Anderson (149) in the \\"Death Valley Driver 500\\" in 2001. Their former manager, Count Grog, named both men as his top 10 favorite wrestlers of all time. He specifically named Parker as his favorite American wrestler, claiming that he would have been a major territorial star in the 1970s, and expressed his surprise that neither had yet to be signed by either WCW or the WWF. In early-1998, they started working for West Virginia promoter Jim Hawkins and his Atlantic Coast Championship Wrestling beating The Country Cousins (R.J. Stomper and Cousin Elmer) for the ACCW Tag Team Championship on April 11, 1998, in Buckhannon, West Virginia. They held on to the titles for most of the year before dropping them to the Baltimore Bad Boys (Eddie Edmonds and Mike Morgan) on October 10, 1998. Parker and Anderson also continued feuding with the Serial Thrillaz over the OMEGA Tag Team Championship in Matt and Jeff Hardy's OMEGA as well as in SCW. In Appalachian Mountain Wrestling later that year, Death & Destruction defeated Bryan Wayne and Scott Sterling (substituting for Stan Lee) in Coeburn, Virginia for the APW Tag Team Championship. =Southern States Wrestling (1999)= In January 1999, Parker and Anderson began challenging then SSW Tag Team Champions The Christian Brothers (Danny & Bam Bam Christian). The two teams battled in a memorable brawl on the January 24th \\"Southern States Wrestling TV Special\\" in Kingsport, Tennessee before defeating them for the titles in Kingsport a week later. While still champions, they made their second WWF appearance as a team wrestling The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy) at the sold-out UTC Arena in Chattanooga, Tennessee in front of 7,900 fans; the match later aired on the February 27th edition of Shotgun Saturday Night. They lost the belts back to the Christians back in Kingsport on April 25. The feuding continued, however, and a three-way match between the Christian Brothers, Death & Destruction and Steve Flynn & K.C. Thunder on July 10 in Kingsport, saw the titles go to the third team. The titles were eventually held up and declared vacant following \\"a wild brawl\\" between the three teams, with Beau James substituting for K.C. Thunder, on September 10. Parker and Anderson won the vacant titles in a match against the Memphis Bodyguards to begin their eighth and final title reign. They regularly appeared on the promotion's short-lived television show, defending the championship against such opponents as Joe Fillers & Slammin' Sam and The British Knights, before The New Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Ricky Harrison) defeated them for the belts in Johnson City, Tennessee on December 12, 1999. They also met The Batten Twins (Brad and Bart Batten) in Appalachia Pro Wrestling that same month. =Final years (1999‚Äì2002)= While continuing to wrestle for SSW, and after their departure, Death & Destruction continued touring the Southern independents. In the summer of 1999, Parker and Anderson were among the wrestlers who participated in the \\"Curtis Comes Home\\" supercard, a benefit show for World Championship Wrestling referee Brian Hildebrand, held at the Ice Gardens in Rostraver, Pennsylvania on July 30. The show featured wrestlers from Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation.Lane, Matthew. \\"Limited Number of \\"Curtis Goes Home\\" T-Shirts and Programs now available. Own your piece of wrestling history today.\\" DeclarationofIndependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., 5 Jan. 2009. Web. 5 October 2011. . They were originally scheduled to wrestle The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge), however, Beau James ended up teaming Roger Anderson while Parker wrestled Julio Sanchez in a singles match; their longtime rival wrestled as an official member of Death & Destruction for one- night only. Like the rest of the talent, Parker and Anderson wrestled without payment in order to ensure that the maximum amount of money was raised. Parker and Anderson were both part of SSW's tribute to Mark Curtis, the Mark Curtis Weekend of Champions, which raised funds for the Children's Miracle Network. The team defeated Something Else (John Noble and Ed Browning) for the NCW Tag Team Championship at the second annual Weekend of Champions. They also wrestled for KYDA Pro Wrestling, affiliated with Cueball Carmichael's Keep Your Dreams Alive wrestling school in Staunton, Virginia, which saw the team briefly split up. On March 11, 2000, a match between the two ended in a 10-minute time limit draw. On June 2, 2001 at the Salem Civic Center, Death & Destruction wrestled on the North American Wrestling Association's Legends Tour which featured Doink the Clown, Boris Zhukov, Ivan Koloff, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, and Chief Wahoo McDaniel. A month later, they won the BWF Tag Team Championship after defeating The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch) in a tournament final held in Puerto Rico. Death & Destruction spent their last year in various independents. Their most notable appearances were for National Pro Wrestling and Carolina Championship Wrestling. On June 22, 2002, they entered NPW's first-ever tag team tournament held at the Mullins Elementary School in Pikeville, Kentucky. Their last appearance as a team was at a special CCW supercard, \\"Mid Atlantic Reunion\\", as a tribute to \\"the great legends of Mid Atlantic Wrestling's past\\". The show was held on July 6, 2002, at Uncle Bill's Flea Market in Sylva, North Carolina and featured many former stars including Jimmy Valiant, The Barbarian, Mr. Hughes, Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, and Bunkhouse Buck. Magnum T.A. also made a rare appearance in the semi-main event serving as the cornerman of Ricky Morton and The Iron Sheik during their match against Buddy Landel and George South. Parker and Anderson beat Jason King and T.C. Carter. Frank Parker subsequently left the business while Roger Anderson returned to SSW. For a few years afterwards, Anderson continued wrestling on the independents as a singles wrestler before retiring to become a high school teacher in Tennessee.

Built in an Italianate style in about 1890, it was added to the register in 1989. The building is a wood-frame structure erected in the late 19th century to house businesses serving the Sunnyside neighborhood. Exterior features of the building include a cornice and overhanging parapet along the front (north) face. The second-floor north face has a central pair of double-hung sash windows flanked by two polygonal bays, each with three sash windows. Three doors and four display windows on the first floor face Belmont Street. The door in the center leads to a stairway to the second floor. History Southeast Portland grew rapidly between 1883 and 1910 after the opening of bridges linking the city's west side with sparsely populated areas across the Willamette River. Early streetcar routes led east from the bridges, and one of them followed Belmont Street. The Sunnyside neighborhood, platted by the Sunnyside Land and Improvement Company in 1888, was the first development along an eastside streetcar route. Its shopping center included the Knight Building. Few similar buildings from this era remain in southeast Portland; most have been replaced by larger or more sturdy structures. Although the exact date of construction and the name of the builder are unknown, deed records suggest that J.S. Winslow was the builder. He bought the property from the Sunnyside Land and Improvement Company, then sold it a few months later, in 1889, to Deborah Kent. She sold it in 1895 to J.S. McDaniel, who owned it through 1915. City directories say that a post office was located on part of the first floor from 1898 through 1911.

Geology The western face of Black Mountain. The rock formation in the foreground is the same phyllite formation found on Black Mountain. The mountain is composed of two main rock types that are roughly divided between western and eastern halves of the mountain. The west side of the mountain is composed of a ~250 m. bed of meta-sedimentary rockPewe and Doorn (1991) distinguishable as phyllite and argillite. From a distance, the meta-sedimentary rock is easily mistaken for basalt, which is common in the area, however basalt is not found on Black Mountain. The phyllite has a slaty cleavage and is foliated in all directions, a result of shortening due to pressure-solution volume-diffusion of as much as 50%. As a result of shortening, streambeds of nearby washes are filled with black alluvium. The western face meta-sedimentary beds strike ~120, 45. When fully illuminated by afternoon sun, the dipping, angular rocks resemble overlapping flatirons. The meta-sedimentary beds rise nearly 1300 feet above the local topography. Black Mountain rises 3398 feet above sea level. The eastern side of the mountain is composed of a granitic intrusion into the meta-sedimentary rock. The granite is part of a batholith dated 14 m.y.a locally known as Camelback Granite. It extends southward from Black Mountain and is expressed in outcrops in the McDowell Mountains, the Union Hills, and Camelback Mountain. Texturally, the granite varies from a large crystal with phenocrysts of up to 2.5 cm., to a finer grained crystal texture. Larger grained Camelback granite shows large joints fractured both vertically and horizontally. It is weathered into spheroidal boulder columns and balanced rock formations. Jointing in the finer grained granite is smaller and proportional to grain size. The granitic half of Black Mountain tapers to a flat-topped peak that rises to a height just below that of the pointed, black phyllite peak of the western side. The two units meet as a saddle between the twin peaks of meta- argillite/phyllite and granite. Phyllite embayed in granite along contact. The phyllite piece is ~20 cm. Along the contact on the eastern side of the mountain, clasts of pelitic schist can be found embayed in the large-grained granite. The granite at the contact is gray in color, having been discolored by the sedimentary rock during emplacement. Clasts of smaller grained granite are also found in the large-grained granite. The meta-sedimentary rock along with the granite batholith that forms Black Mountain are remnants of what laid hidden beneath a sea and underground, that are now exposed by headward erosion that continues northward today into Arizona's Transition Zone. The highly shortened and foliated phyllite began as a mudstone which was metamorphosed to shale. The shale was then subjected to pressure-solution volume-diffusion; the rock was metamorphosed while deeply buried then subjected to heating during the emplacement of the batholith. The phyllite at the granite contact formed a weak horizon, which assisted the decollement process after the batholith was emplaced. These chloritic rocks acted as a lubricated sheet, effectively sliding off the batholith and tilting to the northwest during the Tertiary extension event. To the south, grabens that formed by normal faulting during crustal extension, are filled by the alluvium from the subsequent erosion. People and Culture of the Black Mountain/Desert Foothills Area While Carefree and Cave Creek are today a home for upper-income retirees and an enclave for artists and entrepreneurs, the first inhabitants of the area surrounding Black Mountain were Native Americans known as the Hohokam, who appear at about 750 A.D. They were an agrarian society of hunters and gatherers who also used irrigation to maintain crops. Their \\"waffle gardens\\" can still be seen in the Spur Cross Ranch reserve area North of Cave Creek. The remains of dwellings of the Hohokam are called \\"pit houses\\". The best example of a pit house is located at the Sears-Kay ruin located northeast of Black Mountain near Seven Springs, although pit houses have been uncovered during construction of homes in Cave Creek. Pit houses were constructed with a rock-wall base and covered with roof supports of long branches covered with thatch. The Sears-Kay ruins mark a time in Hohokam history when they had moved to high ground with views into the Valley, presumably to see their enemies, raiding tribes of Yavapai and Tonto Apache, approaching from a long distance. Evidence of the Hohokam living in the Black Mountain area disappears around 1450 A.D., when some anthropologists believe they moved into the Valley using their skill at irrigation and possibly becoming the Pima. Before disappearing entirely, the Hohokam stopped cremating their dead and began burying remains. Some believe the Hohokam ran out of wood for fires. Scarcity of wood was likely due to a long drought. Others believe there was a large fire which led to the sudden disappearance of the Hohokam. From about 1450 to the 1870s the area was considered Apache territory. Bands of marauding Tonto Apache largely controlled the area. Although they lived farther north, the Apache were raiders that patrolled the area and when efforts were made to establish \\"rancharitas\\" in the Desert Foothills, bands of Apache would attack, and often kill, the trespassers. Efforts to settle the territory were intensified in the 1870s with the discovery of gold in the area. This was when Gen. George Stoneman and his troops built Military Road, a main artery in modern-day Cave Creek, to protect the miners and anyone else crossing through the Desert Foothills. A remount station where riders could rest and pick up a fresh horse before continuing on their journey was located at near what is now Spur Cross Road in Cave Creek. After the U.S. Military had eliminated the threat of attack from the Apache, mining claims began to spring up in the Cave Creek area. The first discovery of gold was made by William Rowe on what became known (optimistically) as Gold Hill near the Tonto Hills northeast of Cave Creek. The area around Black Mountain was referred to as the Cave Creek Mining District, but the district was never formally established.Carlson, F. (1988) In 1878 the first stamp mill opened at the Golden Star Mine on Continental Mountain. The most productive mine in the area was the Phoenix Mine was located at what is today the entrance to the Spur Cross Conservancy area. Tailings from the mining operation are all that remain today. The mine was closed by 1905, and most other mining efforts in the area had stopped by 1910. In the late 1880s cattle and sheep ranches were being established wherever streams provided adequate water to support a herd. But recurring drought and overpopulation of herd animals soon lead to water shortages, and the cattle ranchers were forced to look for new ways to support themselves. The answer for some ranchers was to transform cattle ranches into dude ranches where Easterners would come for a taste of the wild west experience. Spur Cross Ranch was one of the most successful dude ranches in the Black Mountain area, and remained in business until the 1970s when its owner died in a plane crash while attempting to land on a runway located on the ranch.

Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert, Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Also available at: University of California, Riverside, Rivera Library Eytel's most important work, Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library. It was originally hung at the State Capitol in the Main Corridor. See Life =Early life and immigration= Carl Eytel was born as Karl Adolf Wilhelm Eytel in Maichingen, B√∂blingen to Tusnelda (n√©e Schmid) and Friederick Hermann Eytel, a Lutheran minister in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg (now the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, near Stuttgart), Germany.German Immigrants, 1880s: Carl Eytel from Wurtemberg to Kansas in 1885 arrived: 11-04-1885; occupation: hunter; destination: Kansas; native country: Wurtemberg; native city: Machingen; embarkation port: Hamburg; manifest number: 38415. As a boy, he became a ward of his grandfather when his father died. Eytel was well educated in the German gymnasium and became enamored of the American West while reading the works of Prussian natural science writer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, which he found in the Stuttgart Royal Library. (Available as a pdf file through the HathiTrust Digital Library.) From 1880 to 1884 he studied forestry in T√ºbingen and then was drafted into the German Army. He first traveled to the United States in 1885 aboard the Suevia and worked as a ranch hand in Kansas. Later he worked at a slaughterhouse for 18 months to earn his living and to study cattle. In 1891, he read an article about the Palm Springs area in the San Francisco Call and was \\"incited\\" to visit the California desert. =Palm Springs= Eytel returned to Germany to study art for 18 months (1897‚Äì1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States. Wanting to be a cowboy, he worked as a cowhand in the San Joaquin Valley and in 1903 he would settle in Palm Springs. Living in small cabins he built himself, Palm Springs would remain his home.; (print and on- line); and, Eytel often walked on his travels, covering 400 miles in the Colorado Desert on foot. On one of his travels he was nearly lynched as a horse thief and in 1918, during a trip to northern Arizona, he was threatened with lynching as a German spy. Work Pinus lambertiana (sugar-pine) by Eytel, from J. Smeaton Chase, Cone-bearing Trees of the California Mountains, 1911 While living for the most part as a \\"desert rat\\" and starving artist, he both traveled alone throughout the American Southwest and accompanied author J. Smeaton Chase and painter Jimmy Swinnerton on their travels.; Serving as George Wharton James' guide to \\"every obvious and obscure location of importance\\", he illustrated James' two volume The Wonders of the Colorado Desert.Eytel contributed 1 full page painting (Mirage in the Desert (1905)) and 173 pen sketches to Volume I and 164 pen sketches to Volume II. The work was successful and received generally favorable reviews. Hudson's book was reviewed in: Reviews included:  * * The collaboration on the book lasted from 1903 to 1907. Eytel's illustrations were also used by James in his 1906 article \\"The Colorado Desert: As General Kearney Saw It\\". =Successes= By 1908 Eytel was exhibiting works in Pasadena and enjoying the patronage of socialite Martha M. Newkirk. He was also planning to build a bungalow in Beaumont, California. And, in 1909, his work was being exhibited in major art venues and the Kanst gallery in Los Angeles. Later, in 1911, after traveling with Chase on horseback, he contributed 21 realistic line art drawings to Chase's book, Cone-bearing Trees of the California Mountains.; and, Besides his work in Wonders of the Colorado Desert and Cone-bearing Trees, Eytel contributed (both drawings and articles) to the best periodicals, including the Los Angeles Times and, for nearly 14 years, the New Yorker Staats- Zeitung. (During his travels in the southwest he became friends with Los Angeles Times city editor Charles Lummis.) A stone wall in the dining room of Dr. Welwood Murray's early hotel was covered with an Eytel mural of Palm Canyon. His hundreds of drawings of native palms were his trademark and he became known as \\"The Artist of the Palms\\".His reputation as \\"the desert artist\\" continued. In 1913 he was visited by Ulysses S. Grant IV, then age 20. Also available at His work helped publicize early Palm Springs. In 1977 his works were selling for $10,000 and under. =\\"Creative Brotherhood\\"= Along with naturalist Edmund C. Jaeger, and authors Chase and Charles Francis Saunders,; also see , and Eytel was a core member of what University of Arizona Professor Peter Wild called a \\"Creative Brotherhood\\" that lived in Palm Springs in the early 20th century. Other Brotherhood members included cartoonist and painter Swinnerton, author James, and photographers Fred Payne Clatworthy and Stephen H. Willard.; and, (here for Table of Contents) The men lived near each other (like Eytel, Jaeger built his own cabin), traveled together throughout the Southwest, helped with each other's works, and exchanged photographs which appeared in their various books. The Brotherhood lasted from 1915 when Jaeger, who was the teacher in the Palm Springs one-room school house, met Eytel and Chase. It ended in 1923 when Chase died.At the start of World War I Eytel took the conflict personally towards his old English friend Chase; but they may have reconciled when peace was achieved. (In 1924, after completing his studies at Occidental College in Los Angeles, Jaeger began a 30-year teaching career at Riverside Junior College in Riverside, California.The Museum of Riverside has a permanent \\"desert cabin\\" exhibit about Jaeger which references Eytel as his mentor. See: Museum of Riverside permanent exhibits.) Jaeger wrote the initial eulogy for Eytel upon his death and in 1948, recalling his time with him, Jaeger said: Over the years it was Eytel who served as their \\"spiritual figurehead\\". Even after Jaeger left to complete his studies and Chase married the wealthy Isabel White (1917), the three, plus Saunders, often exchanged letters. Suffering from a \\"hacking and persistent cough\\", Eytel remained in Palm Springs, impoverished, and Swinnerton would buy art supplies for him. Later Eytel became a recluse. =Smoketree School= Smoketree (Psorothamnus spinosus) Journalist Ann Japenga has characterized Eytel's work as \\"Smoketree School\\" ‚Äì a school which is named after a favorite desert art subject, the smoketree. The school has origins with Alson S. Clark and Jack Frost, who were influenced by French impressionist Claude Monet. Other Smoketree artists include Carl Bray, Fred Chisnall, Maynard Dixon, Clyde Forsythe, Sam Hyde Harris, John Hilton, R. Brownell McGrew, Agnes Pelton, Hanson Puthuff and Swinnerton.Japenga's commentaries are at:  =Style and subjects= from J. Smeaton Chase Our Araby (1920) (Electronic copy) Like many artists of the desert southwest, Eytel's style was impressionistic. His subjects were varied and included the Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori, in the Tumac√°cori National Historical Park near Nogales, Arizona (pre-restoration), and California Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel and Mission San Juan Capistrano Spanish missions. His drawings for Cone-bearing Trees of the California Mountains and Wonders of the Colorado Desert were especially detailed and included Desert Bighorn Sheep, desert reptiles, and cattle. (His Mirage in the Desert (1905), painted for Wonders, depicts cattle and cowboys.) Desert near Palm Springs Eytel depicted the life of Navajo, Hopi, Cahuilla, Serrano and Kamia peoples, including landscapes of the New Mexico Eight Northern Pueblos in San Ildefonso, Laguna, Tesuque and Taos Pueblo. The Walpi Pueblo on First Mesa, Hopi Reservation, Arizona, and Cocopah people near Calexico, California were drawn as well.; and, ‚Äì includes drawings of Indian houses, wells, basket granaries and ollas) Prospectors working the Anaconda (Dale District) and Manana (Colorado River) mines in Arizona and the famous Picacho gold mine were drawn, as were the Rancho Guajome Adobe near Encinitas, California, the Sierra Bonita Ranch near Fort Grant, Arizona, turn of the century Tucson, Arizona, and the Yuma Territorial Prison, Yuma, Arizona. His scenes from early Palm Springs included the stagecoach station and William Pester ‚Äì \\"The Hermit of Palm Springs\\".; and, California Fan Palms (Washingtonia filifera), a favorite of Eytel, in Palm Canyon, near Palm Springs Eytel's landscapes and mountain scenes in Wonders included: * Ehrenberg, Arizona * Algodones, including the Pilot Knob landmark, Imperial County, California * Palo Verde, Arizona * San Jacinto National Forest, California * Oak Creek Canyon, within Coconino National Forest, Arizona * Mt.

His funeral and burial were arranged by Nellie Coffman, who had established the original Desert Inn in the Palm Springs village in 1909. * Professor Wild disputes that the Indian cemetery burial was a particular honor, contending that non-Indian burials were fairly common. He also documents this contention in his 2007 Letters from Palm Springs (1:140‚Äì142). Eytel received the following eulogy from Saunders writing in August 1926: His painting Desert near Palm Springs (1914) is displayed in the California History Room of the California State Library.

He was educated at St. Peter's College, and took his M.L. and M.A. degrees at Cambridge University. He returned to South Australia in 1875 and was admitted to the South Australian Bar in April 1879. He joined in partnership with W. H. Bundey and C. J. Dashwood as \\"Bundey, Dashwood & Hawker\\" from 1879 to 1883, then practised alone until 1888. In 1884 he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly, representing the electorate of Stanley from April 1884 to May 1889. This was the first time father and son had sat in the House concurrently. He resigned to study mining and metallurgy in Europe.

(9 November 1911 - 19 September 1945 in Budapest, Hungary) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order. During The Holocaust in Hungary, Fr. Kun was also the commander of an Anti-Semitic death squad for the Arrow Cross Party. After the Second World War, Father Kun was prosecuted for war crimes by the Communist People's Republic of Hungary. He was convicted and hanged. Life Father Kun was born 8 November 1911 in Ny√≠rb√°tor, Kingdom of Hungary. He attended seminary in Rome. He then served as a priest in a Franciscan monastery. In 1943, Fr. Kun was, according to journalist Rezs≈ë Szirmai, expelled from the monastery and moved to Budapest. Although it is uncertain whether he ever had valid faculties, Fr. Kun sometimes gave sermons and offered Nuptial Masses at Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic Church in V√°rosmajor. In early 1944, Kun enrolled in Hungary's Pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party. During the lead-up to the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, Kun participated in the Arrow Cross' seizure of power by distributing weapons. Fr. Kun later recalled, \\"The propaganda drilled into us the belief that the Jews lurk behind the Bolsheviks. Amidst the wildest battles, I stood with this conviction and as Jews came before me, I beat them.‚Äù Soon after, the Arrow Cross and the Schutzstaffel began The Holocaust in Hungary. Meanwhile, Fr. Kun took command of an Arrow Cross death squad which massacred Jews. During these activities, he continued to dress in his cassock and Roman collar along with a holstered pistol and an Arrow Cross armband. His orders usually ran, \\"In the name of Christ - fire!\\"Kriszti√°n Ungv√°ry, The Battle for Budapest: One Hundred Days in World War II, page 241. In a later interview with journalist Rezs≈ë Szirmai, Fr. Kun recalled, \\"I always wanted to reduce human misery and suffering. This is why I fought against the Jews. They are the lords of capital. The Jews were always the ones to walk on the sunny side of the street.\\" In January 1945, Fr. Kun ordered the arrest of Jewish author Ern≈ë Ligeti and his family. Fr. Kun and his death squad brutally tortured Ligeti‚Äôs son and his wife. The Ligetis were then taken to Arrow Cross headquarters at Andr√°ssy √∫t 60, interrogated, stripped naked and tied together. Then, around midnight, they faced a firing squad. Ern≈ë Ligeti and his wife were killed on the spot, but their son K√°roly, survived four bullets, recovered from his wounds, and later emigrated from Hungary. On 12 January 1945, Kun's squad broke into the Jewish hospital in Maros street (Hospital of the Buda Chevra Kadisha), where 149 Jewish patients and doctors were summarily shot. On another occasion, the St. John's Hospital was invaded by Kun's unit and between 80 and 100 people were murdered. His squad also invaded sheltered housing and abducted some 500 Jews and their protectors. All were lined up and shot into the Danube River. On another occasion, men under Fr. Kun's command broke into a sanatorium, where 100 Jewish patients were shot to death. Father Kun did not flee the city before the Siege of Budapest, but remained behind while continuing operations. His squad routinely subjected Gentiles who were hiding Jews to torture and execution. Once, when regular gendarmes arrested and beat him, Kun spent 20 days in prison. Soon after his release, the Soviet Army completed their capture of Budapest. Kun was arrested and tried for 500 murders by a Hungarian People's Tribunal. On the day of his execution, he gave an interview to journalist Reszs≈ë Szirmai. In the interview, Fr. Kun admitted to beating Jews, but denied killing anyone and claimed to have been falsely convicted. Fr. Kun told Szirmai that he considered himself to be even more of a victim than any of the Jews who died in the Holocaust. When Szirmai commented that the manner in which Fr. Kun had treated his victims displayed signs of sadism, Fr. Kun replied, \\"This perversion exists, in a dormant state, in every soul.‚Äù When asked if it existed in his soul as well, Fr. Kun responded: ‚ÄúIf it did, then it was dormant. I was not conscious of it.‚Äù Fr. Andr√°s Kun was executed by hanging in Budapest on September 19, 1945. Legacy Rezs≈ë Szirmai went on to interview 20 other Arrow Cross war criminals and published a book-length collection of his interviews, Fasisza lelkek (\\"Fascist Souls\\"), in 1946. Some of his other interview subjects included Ferenc Sz√°lasi, Andor Jaross, and B√©la Imr√©dy. After the fall of Communism in Hungary, a second edition was published in 1993. Father Kun's cassock is currently on display at the House of Terror in Budapest. In his bestselling history of the Siege of Budapest, Hungarian historian Kriszti√°n Ungv√°ry describes Fr. Kun's crimes in detail. In the process, however, he also comments that, while Fr. Kun and his unit were massacring Jews, the Papal Nuncio to Hungary, Mgr. Angelo Rotta, was working closely with Raoul Wallenberg and other neutral diplomats and helped to save tens of thousands of Jewish lives.

Life He graduated from Bucknell University with a B.S. where he studied with Robert Slonaker, and from University of Illinois with an M.S. and Ph.D. He teaches at Monash University, the University of Melbourne, and the University of Florida. He is one of three inaugural Laureate Professors at the University of Melbourne. Work  Boger is known for his studies of non- Newtonian fluids (which behave both as liquids and solids) which have improved the understanding of how this group of fluids flow and led to major financial and environmental benefits. Boger discovered 'perfect' non-Newtonian fluids, which are elastic and have constant viscosity and are now known as Boger fluids, which enabled him to explain how non-Newtonian fluids behave. He was able to apply his ideas to improve the disposal of \\"red mud\\", a toxic waste produced during the manufacture of aluminium from bauxite and a major environmental problem. His findings have also led to improved inks for industrial inkjet printers, insecticide chemicals that spread evenly on leaves and reduced drag in oil pipelines. He was elected to the Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science in 1993 and served on the Council of the Australian Academy of Science from 1999-2002. He was awarded the Matthew Flinders Medal and Lecture in 2000. In 2007 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Society of Victoria.

The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by Claude Shannon and published with an introduction by Warren Weaver for Bell Laboratories.Shannon, C. E., & Weaver, W. (1949). The mathematical theory of communication. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press Following the basic concept, communication is the process of sending and receiving messages or transferring information from one part (sender) to another (receiver). In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model with the sender-message-channel-receiver (SMCR) model of communication.Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013. Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver.Qing- Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (1992) A model for project communication medium evaluation and selection.  Shannon‚ÄìWeaver Model  Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers who worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to ensure that telephone cables and radio waves worked at maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon‚ÄìWeaver model, which expanded a mathematical theory of communication.Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994) The Shannon‚ÄìWeaver model, developed in 1949, is referred to as the 'mother of all models'Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005 and is widely accepted as a main initial model for communication studies. Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982) The Shannon‚ÄìWeaver model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. The initial model consisted of four primary parts: sender, message, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the sender on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver recognized that static or background sounds may interfere with a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal. Shannon and Weaver's original model contains five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination. The information source is where the information is stored. In order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carries any noise or interference that might lead to the signal receiving different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver and is reconstructed (decoded) from the signal before finally arriving at its destination. In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in natural language) is sent in some form (as spoken language) from an transmitter/emisor/sender/encoder to a receiver/decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements: * An information source, which produces a message. * A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals. * A channel, for which signals are adapted for transmission. * A receiver, which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it. * An information destination, which processes the message. Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication: # The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted? # The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'? # The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior? Daniel Chandler criticizes the transmission model in the following terms: * It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals. * It makes no allowance for differing purposes. * It makes no allowance for differing interpretations. * It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.  Berlo  In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the sender-message-channel-receiver (SMCR) model of communication.Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, & Winston. The SMCR model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars. Berlo's communication process is a simple application for person-to-person communication, which includes communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver.Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.Slukov√°, Petra Zia.

After the message is developed, which are elements in a set of symbols, the sender step begins. The encoding process is where the motor skills take place by speaking, writing, touching, etc. The message goes through the channel which carries the message. Then the receiver step begins. The decoding process is where the sensory skills take place by hearing, seeing, feeling touch, etc. Finally, the communication process ends at the destination, which is the part that interprets the message using its communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture.  Schramm  Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: message (what type of things are communicated), source/emissor/sender/encoder (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which medium), destination/receiver/decoder (to whom). Wilbur Schramm (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), The process and effects of communication (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press. Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another person or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings). Communication can be seen as processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules: # Syntactic (formal properties of signs and symbols). # Pragmatic (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users). # Semantic (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent). Therefore, communication is social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores autocommunication, including intrapersonal communication via diaries or self- talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.  Barnlund  In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), Communication theory (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction. The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages. In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a speech act. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of noise on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this send- receive model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook, and that these two codebooks are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like codebooks is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties. Theories of co-regulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar Harold Innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society. His famous example of this is using ancient Egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties: stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called 'space binding'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and 'time binding', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.  Constructionist  There is an additional working definition of communication to consider that authors like Richard Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted. This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model. Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist. The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman. Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of CBS model (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: \\"If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style\\" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis. Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: \\"What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given\\" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression. The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as Richard A. Lanham and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. Communication stands so deeply rooted in human behaviors and the structures of society that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events. Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines. Communication model terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15): * noise; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message. For example: ** physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you. ** physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough. ** psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can‚Äôt speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them. ** semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables. * sender; the initiator and encoder of a message; * receiver; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message; * decode; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience; * encode; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message; * channel; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages); * feedback; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal); * message; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea. Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things. Language is the source of meaning. Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other. Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing. Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Linear  This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the sender encoding a message and channeling it to the receiver in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993). The linear communication model was first introduced by Shannon and Weaver in 1949. In this model, the message travels one direction from the sender to the receiver. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver, the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice & Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)  Interactive/convergence  It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has \\"field of experience\\" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity, geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs ‚Äì there is feedback but it is not simultaneous. The Interactive Model. *For example, ‚Äì instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.  Communication theory framework  Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints: *Mechanistic: This view considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above) *Psychological: This view considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message. *Social Constructionist (Symbolic Interactionist): This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning. The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is. The Constructionist View assumes that \\"truth\\" and \\"ideas\\" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication. Robert T. Craig saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as \\"‚Ä¶an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re- forms our personal identities.\\" (Craig, 125). The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like. The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that. But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, \\"‚Ä¶in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream. In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another\\" (Lanham, 7). The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas. Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying \\"The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication\\" (Chandler, 2). Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well. We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others. *Systemic: This view considers communication to be the new messages created via \\"through-put\\", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re- interpreted as it travels through people. *Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory. Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.  Ontology  Ontology essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality. The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions. Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels. Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.  Epistemology  Epistemology is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon. Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.  Axiology  Axiology is concerned with how values inform research and theory development. Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches. The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations. The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings. The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated. This approach is often adopted by critical theorists who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.

Early life  Boone was born in the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn to Elliott W. Boone Sr., a United States Postal Service employee, and Thelma Boone (n√©e Strothers). Boone graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in the Cambria Heights neighborhood of Queens in New York City. In high school, Boone was on the track team and basketball team. Boone attended LaGuardia Community College. He graduated from Los Angeles City College with a degree in business administration.  Career  Boone started writing poetry in his first year at LaGuardia Community College. He worked as a sports reporter for York College's Pandora Box and Los Angeles City College's Los Angeles Collegian newspapers. The first book he ever wrote was for the Yale Series of Younger Poet Contest. He did not win but the contest inspired him to write more books. In 1990, Boone began working as a New York City foot messenger for Rapid Messenger Service. Working as a messenger, delivering and picking up packages either by foot or by bike, was a common occupation for many former high school track stars at that time. Boone is classified as a \\"metro\\" messenger, which means he delivers and picks up packages by foot using the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) service. Metro is short for MTA. Boone became known for being one of the fastest foot messengers in New York City. While working as a foot messenger and riding the subway on the jobs that are typically less than an hour, Boone writes poetry that is influenced by his travels and encounters with people. Boone started to become known as a fast courier and talented poet, performing poetry at many New York City events. That eventually led him to produce his first book of poems, Looking For Myself, which was published in 1996. By that time he had left Rapid Messenger Service in 1994. In addition in the 1990s he was also be a sales representative for the Quarterly Black Review of Books and later a marketing representative for the Harlem Book Fair, a division of QBR. In 2000, he again went back into messenger work, but this time he would document his experiences in books and videos. Since 2000 in his 12 years as a messenger, he has been reported upon in the media and made the cover of Courier Magazine, with the front headline: \\"Nobody knows The Gritty Streets of NYC better than Kurt Boone.\\" Feature stories about Boone have been published in The New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Post and Metro New York. Boone's writing work has also led to opportunities in film and video. He appears in Verse: A Murder Mystery (2011), Career Courier: The Labor Of Love (2011) and produced The Messenger Poet Show (2011), a web television series. In total, Boone worked at Rapid Messenger Service, Excel Messenger Service, Kangaroo Courier and Mobile Messenger Service ‚Äì all based in New York City. Boone's four books of poetry are a loose collection that he calls his messenger poetry series, which documents stories about messengers in verse form, in poetry. Boone's 2016 book, Subway Beats: Celebrating New York City Buskers, features over 250 musicians in approximately 30 subway stations. It took him over three years to compile and complete the book, which he documented on an online blog. Boone appeared in Spike Lee's 1992 film, Malcolm X. Boone cites the author Frank McCourt and playwright Langston Hughes as influences on his work.  Personal life  Boone lives in the Cambria Heights neighborhood of Queens in New York City. Boone is known by his foot messenger dispatch name, Messenger 841. It is also the name of an eponymous line of clothing and messenger bags, as well as a consulting company for marketing and film production.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. , accessed November 13, 2011 northward-flowing stream originating in the lower foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains in Los Altos Hills in Santa Clara County, California, United States. It courses northerly through the cities of Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto, before joining Adobe Creek just south of U.S. Highway 101. As Adobe Creek, its waters continue northwards to southwest San Francisco Bay after crossing under Highway 101 and traversing the Palo Alto Flood Basin. History 1862 George F. Allardt Map of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad ‚Äì Barron Creek joins Crosby's Creek (now Matadero Creek) south of (above) El Camino Real, as also shown on the 1899 map. In 1844 Rancho La Purisima Concepcion was sold to Juana Briones de Miranda, whose family members had accompanied both the Gaspar de Portol√† and the Juan Bautista de Anza Expeditions. Her uniquely constructed wood-framed, rammed-earth and adobe brick house, believed to have been built by American deserter sailors, is located at 4155 Old Adobe Road on the border between Palo Alto and Los Altos Hills, and is marked by a historical marker at the corner of Old Adobe Road and Old Trace Lane. Designated a California State Historical Landmark in 1954, the 160-year-old Juana Briones home was scheduled for demolition in 2007 because of damage to it by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. In 2009, it still stands and has been recently documented with a Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). After 1831, Mexican rancho owners would logically erect their dwellings on or very near creeks. Locally, Juanita Briones's adobe was near Barron Creek. In 1853, Elisha Crosby bought a 250-acre parcel of Rancho Santa Rita, really Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito, from the Robles family in 1853 and named it Mayfield Farm. This would later become Barron Park after Edward Barron. Watershed and course Adobe Creek A minor Barron Creek tributary exiting Esther Clark Park to flow under Old Trace Lane, Palo Alto Barron Creek along Los Robles Avenue in Barron Park, Palo Alto, where homes have driveway bridges over the creek Barron Creek drains about , arising at in Los Altos Hills, California. It is the most modified creek in the Lower Peninsula Watershed, with 67% of its course classified as \\"hardened\\", meaning that most (but not all) of its course north of Foothill Expressway is in a concrete channel to its confluence with Adobe Creek. When there are heavy storm flows, the Barron Creek Diversion Channel, originating just north of Foothill Expressway, is used to divert heavy storm flows from the creek to Matadero Creek. Barron Creek, alternatively known as Dry Creek, was tributary to Matadero Creek on the 1862 Allardt Map and the 1899 Topo Map. In the 1940s, it was diverted along its own channel across Palo Alto, eventually joining Adobe Creek near the Bayshore Highway.New channel shown on 1948 Palo Alto topo map, but confluence with Matadero Creek shown on 1943 Palo Alto topo map. Barron Creek is long, originating in the Los Altos Hills foothills at elevation along La Paloma Road (just north of Alta Tierra Road), then flowing north along La Paloma Road, where it is joined by a Concepcion Road fork at Fremont Road and proceeds along Fremont Road behind Pinewood School, before turning northeasterly along Arastradero Road where it is joined by another minor fork originating in Esther Clark Park. After crossing Foothill Expressway it is buried in an underground pipe just west of Gunn High School but sees daylight where the creek crosses Bol Park Bike Path in a small, man-made flood control basin, then at Laguna Avenue again enters an underground pipe running beneath Los Robles Avenue to El Camino Real. Barron Creek has been greatly modified for flood control purposes; the creek bed downstream from El Camino Real is a concrete trapezoidal channel. In the 1800s, the Baylands marshes ended just north of Alma in Palo Alto, which explains why historical maps show area creeks appearing to terminate before they reach the Bay. Duck-hunting blinds were common in the nineteenth century along what is now Middlefield Road. Habitat and wildlife No native fishes have been reported in the creek, save in its tidal reaches.

A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs. RBMs were initially invented under the name Harmonium by Paul Smolensky in 1986, and rose to prominence after Geoffrey Hinton and collaborators invented fast learning algorithms for them in the mid-2000. RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction, classification, collaborative filtering, feature learning, topic modellingRuslan Salakhutdinov and Geoffrey Hinton (2010). Replicated softmax: an undirected topic model. Neural Information Processing Systems 23. and even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task. As their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: a pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the \\"visible\\" and \\"hidden\\" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, \\"unrestricted\\" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.Miguel √Å. Carreira-Perpi√±√°n and Geoffrey Hinton (2005). On contrastive divergence learning. Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by \\"stacking\\" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation. Structure The standard type of RBM has binary-valued (Boolean/Bernoulli) hidden and visible units, and consists of a matrix of weights W = (w_{i,j}) (size m√ón) associated with the connection between hidden unit h_j and visible unit v_i, as well as bias weights (offsets) a_i for the visible units and b_j for the hidden units. Given these, the energy of a configuration (pair of boolean vectors) is defined as :E(v,h) = -\\\\sum_i a_i v_i - \\\\sum_j b_j h_j -\\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j v_i w_{i,j} h_j or, in matrix notation, :E(v,h) = -a^{\\\\mathrm{T}} v - b^{\\\\mathrm{T}} h -v^{\\\\mathrm{T}} W h This energy function is analogous to that of a Hopfield network. As in general Boltzmann machines, probability distributions over hidden and/or visible vectors are defined in terms of the energy function:Geoffrey Hinton (2010). A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines. UTML TR 2010‚Äì003, University of Toronto. :P(v,h) = \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-E(v,h)} where Z is a partition function defined as the sum of e^{-E(v,h)} over all possible configurations (in other words, just a normalizing constant to ensure the probability distribution sums to 1). Similarly, the (marginal) probability of a visible (input) vector of booleans is the sum over all possible hidden layer configurations: :P(v) = \\\\frac{1}{Z} \\\\sum_h e^{-E(v,h)} Since the RBM has the shape of a bipartite graph, with no intra-layer connections, the hidden unit activations are mutually independent given the visible unit activations and conversely, the visible unit activations are mutually independent given the hidden unit activations. That is, for m visible units and n hidden units, the conditional probability of a configuration of the visible units , given a configuration of the hidden units , is :P(vh) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^m P(v_ih). Conversely, the conditional probability of given is :P(hv) = \\\\prod_{j=1}^n P(h_jv). The individual activation probabilities are given by :P(h_j=1v) = \\\\sigma \\\\left(b_j + \\\\sum_{i=1}^m w_{i,j} v_i \\\\right) and \\\\,P(v_i=1h) = \\\\sigma \\\\left(a_i + \\\\sum_{j=1}^n w_{i,j} h_j \\\\right) where \\\\sigma denotes the logistic sigmoid. The visible units of Restricted Boltzmann Machine can be multinomial, although the hidden units are Bernoulli. In this case, the logistic function for visible units is replaced by the softmax function :P(v_i^k = 1h) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(a_i^k + \\\\Sigma_j W_{ij}^k h_j)} {\\\\Sigma_{k'=1}^K \\\\exp(a_i^{k'} + \\\\Sigma_j W_{ij}^{k'} h_j)} where K is the number of discrete values that the visible values have. They are applied in topic modeling, and recommender systems. =Relation to other models= Restricted Boltzmann machines are a special case of Boltzmann machines and Markov random fields.Asja Fischer and Christian Igel. Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines: An Introduction . Pattern Recognition 47, pp. 25-39, 2014 Their graphical model corresponds to that of factor analysis. Training algorithm Restricted Boltzmann machines are trained to maximize the product of probabilities assigned to some training set V (a matrix, each row of which is treated as a visible vector v), :\\\\arg\\\\max_W \\\\prod_{v \\\\in V} P(v) or equivalently, to maximize the expected log probability of a training sample v selected randomly from V: :\\\\arg\\\\max_W \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\log P(v)\\\\right] The algorithm most often used to train RBMs, that is, to optimize the weight vector W, is the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm due to Hinton, originally developed to train PoE (product of experts) models.Geoffrey Hinton (1999). Products of Experts. ICANN 1999. The algorithm performs Gibbs sampling and is used inside a gradient descent procedure (similar to the way backpropagation is used inside such a procedure when training feedforward neural nets) to compute weight update. The basic, single-step contrastive divergence (CD-1) procedure for a single sample can be summarized as follows: # Take a training sample , compute the probabilities of the hidden units and sample a hidden activation vector from this probability distribution. # Compute the outer product of and and call this the positive gradient. # From , sample a reconstruction of the visible units, then resample the hidden activations from this. (Gibbs sampling step) # Compute the outer product of and and call this the negative gradient. # Let the update to the weight matrix W be the positive gradient minus the negative gradient, times some learning rate: \\\\Delta W = \\\\epsilon (vh^\\\\mathsf{T} - v'h'^\\\\mathsf{T}). # Update the biases and analogously: \\\\Delta a = \\\\epsilon (v - v'), \\\\Delta b = \\\\epsilon (h - h').

Life Born and raised in Hawaii, his guitar playing has been featured on three Grammy-nominated albums, including the soundtrack of the Academy-Award winning film \\"The Descendants\\", starring George Clooney. In 2008, he was second runner up in Guitar Player Magazine's Guitar Superstar competition eliciting praise from judges Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Elliot Easton. In 2012, he was awarded one of Hawaii's top musical honors: a Na Hoku Ki Ho'alu (Slack Key) Legacy Award (Hawaii's ‚ÄúGrammy‚Äù) by the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts. On November 12, 2011, Makana, who had performed previously at the White House, turned a gig performing at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation dinner in Honolulu, attended by President Barack Obama and the leaders of 18 other nations, into a political protest. He started out his performance by playing traditional Hawaiian music, which then started to veer gently into more controversial territory. When nearing the end of his set, he opened his suit jacket to reveal a T-shirt with the words \\"Occupy With Aloha\\" handwritten on it and proceeded to play a song he had recently written called \\"We Are the Many\\", a folky protest song expressing Makana's dissatisfaction with the current disproportion of wealth and failure of democracy and his support of the Occupy movement. ‚ÄúI started out very cautiously because my intention was not to disrupt their dinner. My intention was to subliminally convey a message that I felt was paramount to the negotiations,‚Äù Makana told CNN. ‚ÄúEventually I got enough courage to go into it for an extended period of time. And I ended my show with the line ‚Äòthe bidding of the many not the few.‚Äô I sang it about fifty times in different ways for them to hear‚Äù, resulting in a song that lasted 45 minutes. Rolling Stone Magazine went on to call \\"We Are the Many\\" the \\"anthem of the Occupy movement.\\" Career Makana began singing when he was seven years old, took up 'ukulele at nine and began learning the indigenous art of slack key guitar at eleven. A prot√©g√© of slack key guitar legends, including Bobby Moderow Jr. and the late master Uncle Sonny Chillingworth, Makana has dedicated his life to perpetuating as well as evolving the traditional Hawaiian art form of slack key guitar. From this tradition, Makana has evolved his own dynamic style, coined \\"Slack Rock\\": slack key infused with elements of bluegrass, rock, blues and raga. Makana's playing has garnered praise from such guitar luminaries as Kirk Hammett (Metallica) and Pepe Romero (Spanish Flamenco Master). His debut album ‚ÄúMakana‚Äù was released in 1999; it won the Best World Music Album Award at the Hawaii Music Awards. It was followed by ‚ÄúKoi Au‚Äù in 2002 (‚ÄúA landmark musical statement‚Äù ‚Äì Star Bulletin) and ‚ÄúKi Ho‚Äôalu: Journey of Hawaiian Slack Key‚Äù in 2003. Soon thereafter Makana contributed to the Grammy-nominated albums ‚ÄúHawaiian Slack Key Kings I & II‚Äù. In 2008, his first all-original release ‚ÄúDifferent Game‚Äù came out and in 2009 he released a 20th anniversary slack key guitar instrumental compilation, ‚ÄúVenus, and the Sky Turns to Clay‚Äù. His latest album Ripe was released in 2013 and funded by fans through the online crowd sourcing platform Kickstarter. It was produced by multi-platinum producer Ron Nevison (The Who, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones) and renowned producer Mitchell Froom (Crowded House, Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt), with arrangements by Grammy-award winning keyboardist, composer, and arranger Jeff Bova (Celine Dion, Michael Jackson, Eric Clapton). Makana has toured with or opened for acts such as Jason Mraz, Santana, Elvis Costello, Paul Rodgers, Sting, No Doubt, Jack Johnson, Chris Isaak, John Legend and more. Business dispute In 2013, Makana's former manager Tom Bunch filed a lawsuit against Makana for breach of contract and defamation. DEAD LINK Bunch claimed that Makana rejected work that Bunch had lined up, arranged for performances on his own, failed to respond to communications, was late in paying commissions, and \\"[refused] to work 'when planet Mercury is in retrograde ... approximately six months per year.'\\" Bunch reported that he received a letter from Makana's attorney terminating their contract in July 2013.

It lies approximately to the south of Swindon, very close the M4 motorway. History There is evidence that in 955 King Eadred granted Badbury, then containing twenty-five hides, to Saint Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey. The manor of Badbury was held by the Abbey at the time of the Domesday book, when it was counted as twenty hides.'Parishes: Chiseldon', in A History of the County of Wiltshire, Volume 9 (1970), pp. 6-23, accessed 14 November 2011 In 1203, Badbury was passed to the Bishop of Bath but it was returned to the monks of Glastonbury in 1219, where it remained until 1539. In 1348 a group of villein tenants of the manor of Badbury lead a revolt against their lord and unsuccessfully claimed that they should have the right to hold their land according to the customs of ancient demesne. In 1543, the manor passed to William Essex and over the following two hundred years it passed to the Kibblewhite family, the Redferne family, the Norden family and the Mellish family before eventually being bought by the Stone family in 1718. The Stone family remained at the house until at least the late 20th century. By 1773, the hamlet largely existed along a road between west from Liddington to Chiseldon. The population recorded at 1841 was 395 people. Conservation area Badbury is at the centre of the Badbury Conservation Area, the boundaries of which are drawn to match the historical settlement, totalling about 30 residential homes. Historically, residents of the hamlet would have been farmers, but the hamlet is now centred around a pub, a care home and offices. There is no church, post office or school in the hamlet. In keeping with the historic feel of the village the two modern buildings have been thatched and were designed to match the older buildings.

As a fledgling photographer, he lived in Milan and Paris, where he shot beauty and fashion for major European magazines such as Italian Vogue and French Elle. Afterward, he moved to New York City, where he set up his famous studio on Lafayette Street, traveling frequently to Los Angeles and Europe to shoot fashion, advertising, and portraiture for major publications such as Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar. His fine-art nudes have been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. His shows have included ‚ÄúOriginal Sin‚Äù and ‚ÄúThree Boys from Pasadena ‚Äì A Tribute to Helmut Newton‚Äù with fellow Art Center alumni Just Loomis and Mark Arbeit. Holz has collected a variety of prestigious industry awards over the years including a Grammy and a Clio. Holz works as an adjunct professor and lectures internationally at museums and universities, mentoring young photographers and passing on his photographic aspirations to ‚Äúalways begin and end with light, ‚Äù to ‚Äúdo it all in-camera,‚Äù and to ‚Äúbring modern photography back to the level of the artful burn and dodge of the past.‚Äù Holz continues to travel extensively for his commercial work, fine-art shows, and lectures, and is currently working on several projects, including his upcoming book of nudes. When not exploring remote locations and photographing his muses, George's favorite pastimes include traveling the American backroads in his '58 Airstream and conversing with his chocolate lab, Ruby.  Career  =Early Work= A native of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Holz received his first camera as a gift at age 15, a Minolta SR-T 101. With this camera, he took a photo of country star Lynn Anderson, which was published in People Magazine when Holz was still a teenager. After graduating from high school, Holz traveled to Europe and Israel, practicing travel and documentary photography. Holz was educated at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. While there, he apprenticed with Helmut Newton. Newton encouraged Holz to go to Europe and Holz spent several years at the beginning of his career in Milan, where his fashion editorials appeared in European publications such as Vogue Italia, Madame Figaro, and French Elle. He then returned to Los Angeles and focused on shooting album covers, including Madonna's Borderline. After his success in Europe, Holz moved to New York in the mid-1980s, where he opened a studio in Greenwich Village. He continued to shoot fashion editorial for Harper's Bazaar, Interview Magazine and the New York Times, and began celebrity portraiture as well, publishing his images in InStyle, People, Glamour, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, GQ, and Vanity Fair. Notably, Holz was one of the first major photographers to shoot Angelina Jolie at the beginning of her career. =Current Work= Holz has moved between editorial and advertising work for the past two decades. He created numerous advertising campaigns, including ones for Elizabeth Arden, Bloomingdales, DeBeers and Max Factor, and won a Clio Award for his campaign for the International Gold Corporation. Holz continued to lens the artwork for a number of albums, including those of Shania Twain, Lindsay Lohan, Mariah Carey, Van Halen, Joan Jett, Boyz II Men, and Chaka Kahn. In 1990, he won a Grammy for his artwork on Suzanne Vega's album Days of Open Hand. Holz also began shooting movie posters, including those for Face/Off, The General's Daughter, Along Came a Spider, and Glitter as well as the print campaigns for TV shows House, Smash, Fringe, and Hell's Kitchen. In 2003, George appeared on America's Next Top Model, shooting the models underwater in a tank and serving as a judge. =Books= In 1997, Holz' Original Sin, the exhibition catalogue to his traveling exhibit was published by Domeqc. His collection of celebrity portraits, HOLZ HOLLYWOOD: 30 YEARS OF PORTRAITS\\" was published by DAAB MEDIA in April, 2015 Style Holz calls his style \\"painting with light\\" and his work betrays a sensuous, nuanced vision. Holz has shot both celebrities and nudes, two groups likely to become inhibited in front of the camera. His extensive work in both areas indicates his facility with making subjects comfortable and his ability to draw out his subjects. Holz is most known for his black and white nudes, which he has been shooting since 1974 and which have been exhibited widely. Many of the nudes are shot at Holz' farm in Upstate New York, with the subjects posed outside in nature. Holz began a unique project photographing nudes posed with animal bones, tortoiseshells, and antlers, contrasting living flesh with ancient relics. He also photographed nudes with found objects, juxtaposing the natural and the manmade. Exhibits George Holz has been the subject of international solo shows in Budapest, Hungary and the University of Applied Arts, Vienna (Photographs By George Holz, 1990) and part of a group show Laforet Museum in Tokyo (The Nude in Photography, 1993). His first one-man show was at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in New York. Holz' art show \\"Original Sin\\" was exhibited at the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles, the Staley Wise Gallery in New York City, the Gallery for Fine Photography in New Orleans, the John Cleary Gallery in Houston and the Robert Klein Gallery in Boston, in 1997-98. It also traveled to fine art galleries in New Orleans, Houston, and San Francisco. In 2009, Holz was the subject, along with Just Loomis and Mark Arbeit, of the exhibit \\"Three Boys from Pasadena: A Tribute to Helmut Newton.\\" Conceived and curated by Newton's widow June Newton, the exhibit was devoted to Newton's three longtime assistants and collaborators, and explored Newton's influence on their later work.Gould-Simon, Alisa and Matthew Schneier.

An accompanying book, \\"Three Boys from Pasadena,\\" with an introduction by June Newton, was published in 2010. The book featured a mix of personal work by Loomis, Arbeit and Holz, with memorabilia of their time as Newton's assistants, including contact sheets, letters, snapshots, and journal pages.

Geography The SSSI, notified in 1979, is located mainly within Lanlivery civil parish, north-west of the town of Lostwithiel. The similarly named hamlet of Redmoor is directly east of the reserve.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The nature reserve is owned by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust/Cornwall Trust for Nature. History The river coursing out of the north of the site, a tributary of the River Par, was found to flow through tin-bearing gravels by the early mediaeval period. This part of Red Moor was mined for loose tin until the end of the 19th century and the oxidised metal is thought to give the moor its descriptive name. This SSSI used to belong to the Red Moor‚ÄìBreney Common SSSI, the two sites having split in the 1986 revision where both sites were expanded. It is adjacent to Helman Tor nature reserve. Flora and fauna There are two main habitat types within the site; the dry dwarf-shrub heath to the north and wetter marshy grassland, wetland heath and bog-land in the low-lying basin to the south. The bog contains a variety of Sphagnum peat mosses - that disperse their spores from June to August \\\\- bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), and marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris). Other flora on the site include the climbing corydalis (Ceratocapnos claviculata) and the royal fern (Osmunda regalis). On the site can be found 13 species of dragonfly and damselfly, which include the scarce blue-tailed damselfly, a nationally rare species. Aquatic beetles are also present on the moor, the very scarce Hydrochus nitidicollis being one, as well as 2 uncommon spiders. Birds recorded on the site include the willow tit, tree pipit, European nightjar and the Eurasian sparrowhawk.

The Downtown Clubhouse is in Downtown St. Louis, Missouri, USA and the West Clubhouse is located in the St. Louis County suburb of Town and Country. The MAC awards the annual Hermann Trophy, the highest award in American college soccer, and the Jack Buck Award (in recognition of enthusiastic and dedicated support of sports in the city of St. Louis). Notable members have included President Harry S. Truman, Stan Musial, and Alan Shepard. The American Legion was organized there in 1919. Facilities =Downtown Clubhouse= Missouri Athletic Club's Downtown Clubhouse The Missouri Athletic Club opened its doors on Sept. 13, 1903. The original Clubhouse was located in the Boatman's Bank Building at 4th Street and Washington Ave. in downtown St. Louis. The catalyst for establishing the Club was Charles Henry Genslinger who had successfully opened clubs in New Orleans and New York prior. A fire destroyed the original clubhouse in March 1914. Within two weeks after the fire, a committee was appointed to design and erect a new and more elaborate clubhouse on the same location. A special committee funded the project with bonds sold to prominent St. Louis businessmen like August A. Busch. The present-day Downtown Clubhouse opened its doors on March 1, 1916 with a gala celebration attended by 5,000 people. The new clubhouse, a 10-story facility, was grander than the original. The clubhouse was designed by William B. Ittner and contains two restaurants, a ballroom, a barber shop, numerous private meeting rooms, a reading room, a billiard parlor, a rooftop deck, more than 75 guest rooms, and full-service athletic facilities. The athletic facilities include weight training, a pro shop, whirlpools, tanning beds, saunas, trainers, pros, a masseuse, squash courts, racquetball courts, and handball courts. =West Clubhouse= Missouri Athletic Club's West Clubhouse in Town and Country In 1995, the Missouri Athletic Club purchased the Town and Country Racquet Club, which was built in 1975, and opened it as the MAC's West Clubhouse on June 16, 1995. The Missouri Athletic Club has renovated and expanded its West Clubhouse numerous times over the years. Some of the largest projects took place in 1998, 2004, and 2016. The sprawling West Clubhouse has more than 178,000 square feet of space. It features a 25-meter outdoor swim and dive pool, two restaurants and bars, private event spaces, eight indoor tennis courts, squash courts, racquetball courts, a basketball court and gymnasium, and a fitness center. History In 1903, during the lead-up to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, having organized amateur athletic and social clubs in New York City and New Orleans, entrepreneur Charles Henry Genslinger came to St. Louis and persuaded local prominent citizens to fund a similar club.The New Missouri Athletic Club: 100 Years of History, Tradition & Service (Missouri Athletic Club 2003) Boatmen‚Äôs Bank donated a seven-story building at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue to the Club, which adopted ‚ÄúMissouri Athletic Club‚Äù as its name. More than 3,200 members enrolled prior to the Club‚Äôs opening in September 1903. Immediately upon its founding, the MAC joined the Amateur Athletic Union, which allowed members to participate in the 1904 Summer Olympics, also held in St. Louis. As part of the AAU, the MAC formed basketball, swimming, track, baseball, boxing, wrestling, bowling, and billiards teams, which competed throughout the United States. In 1914, the MAC's clubhouse was destroyed by a fire, which also killed 30 members, guests, and staff. The club decided to construct a new building in its place, which opened in 1916. This has been the clubhouse ever since. From 1916-1939, the MAC was renamed the Missouri Athletic Association. In 1987, the MAC began awarding the Hermann Trophy to the United States's top male and female college soccer players. This is the highest player's award in college soccer, equivalent to the Heisman Trophy for college football. In 1988, the Club‚Äôs membership voted overwhelmingly to admit female members. Before that, membership had been restricted only to men. In 1995, the MAC bought the Town and Country Racquet Club in West St. Louis County. After investing $2 million in upgrading the facilities, it reopened as the Missouri Athletic Club's West Clubhouse. The West Clubhouse was re-renovated for $8 million in 2003.

It is named after its initial words, where it is attributed to Elijah the Prophet. Considered a foundational text of Kabbalah, Patach Eliyahu is known for enumerating and summarizing the sefirot, corresponding them to parts of the body, and describing the infiniteness and uniqueness of God.p. 159, The Thirteen Petalled Rose by R. Adin Steinsaltz. Role in prayer Most Sephardim recite Patach Eliyahu every morning as part of the order for the morning blessings before Shacharit. Chassidim who pray according to the nusach of Arizal as compiled by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi recite it every Friday before the Minchah prayer as a preparation for Shabbat. Ashkenazim do not generally recite Patach Eliyahu in the course of prayer.

I hereby irrevocably license it under CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GFDL. and are not present in the original text. Square brackets [] mark explanatory material inserted by the translator. =Opening= :Elijah opened and said: :Master of the worlds! You are One, but not in number. You are He Who is Highest of the High, Most Hidden of the Hidden; no thought can grasp You at all. =Introduction to the Sefirot= :You are He Who dispatched ten rectifications and called them ten sefirot, with which to conduct the hidden worlds which are not revealed and the revealed worlds. And with them You conceal Yourself from humankind. And You are He Who binds them and unifies them, and to the extent that You are within them, anyone who will separate one among these ten sefirot from its fellows is considered as if he made a separation within You. :And these ten sefirot proceed according to their order: one long [the right axis] one short [the left axis] and one intermediate [the middle axis]. And You are He who conducts them, and there is no one who conducts You, neither above, nor below, nor from any side. :You arranged garments for them, from which fly souls to mankind. And You arranged many bodies for them, which are called \\"bodies\\" compared to \\"garments\\" which cover them and are named in this arrangement: =Anatomical arrangement of the Sefirot= :Chesed [Loving-kindness], the right arm. Gevurah [Might, severity], the left arm. :Tiferet [Harmony], the torso. :Netzach [Victory] and Hod [Glory] the two thighs. :Yesod [Foundation, bonding], the culmination of the body, the sign of the Holy Covenant [the circumcision]. :Malchut [Kingship], the mouth; she is called the Oral Torah. :Chochmah [Wisdom], the brain; that is inner thought. Binah [Understanding], the heart; with her, the heart understands. Of these two, it is written (Deuteronomy 29:28), \\"The hidden things belong to Havayah Elokeinu [the L‚Äërd our G‚Äëd].\\" :Supernal Keter [Crown] - this is the Crown of Kingship [Keter of Malchut; alt. this Keter is Malchut], and regarding her it is said (Isaiah 46:10), \\"From the beginning [Keter] He tells the end [Malchut].\\" And this is the skull of the inner tefillin; that is the 45-Name [the Divine Name \\"Mah\\", spelled ], which is the path of Atzilut. =The nature of the flow of Divine Life-Force= :And this waters the Tree in its limbs and its branches, just as water waters the Tree and it grows itself with this watering. :Master of the Worlds! You are He Who is the Cause of causes and the Source of sources, Who waters the Tree with this flow. And this flow - it is like a soul to the body, because it is Life for the body. :And there is no image or likeness of You, inside or out. :And You created the Heavens and the earth, and sent out from them the sun, the moon, the stars [planets included] and the constellations. And on earth [You sent out], trees, grasses, the Garden of Eden, shrubs, beasts, animals, birds, fish and humankind - to make known through them the things on High, and how You conduct the things on High and Below, and how You make known to them the things on High from the things Below, and there is none that knows You at all. =Divine Unity and Uniqueness= :And aside from You, there is no unity on High or Below. And You are acknowledged [as] the Cause of everything and the Master of everything. :And every sefirah has a known Name, and with these are the angels called. But You have no known Name, because You are He Who fills all Names. And You are the completion of them all. And as soon as You remove Yourself from them, all the Names remain like a body without a soul. =Unknowable transcendence and Divine Justice= :You are He Who is Wise, but not with a knowable wisdom; You are He Who is Understanding, but not with a knowable understanding. You have no known place. :But rather, to make known Your Power and Might to humankind, and to show them how You conduct the world with Justice and Mercy, because there is Righteousness and Judgement according to the deeds of humankind. :Justice is Gevurah; Judgement, the righteous median Pillar; Holy Kingship, the righteous Scales, the two Balance-pans of Truth; the righteous Measure, the sign of the Holy Covenant. All is to show how You conduct the world, but not that You have a known righteousness that is just, nor a known judgement that is merciful, nor any of these attributes at all. =Conclusion= :Blessed is Havayah forever, [alt.

In 2003 she was designated a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. Early life and education Harilyn Rousso was born in 1946 with cerebral palsy. She decided to go into psychotherapy and was discouraged by her professors who believed that a woman with cerebral palsy could not succeed in her career, thus they refused to teach her. She would move on to another training facility and eventually obtained her license. Rousso would also graduate from Brandeis University with a degree in economics. Professional career Rousso's main work focuses on three themes: psychotherapy, disabled women and fine art. After graduation from college she worked at the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. which helped trigger her interest in working with people. In the 1980s Rousso began the Networking Project for Disabled Women and Girls at the New York City YWCA. Later that decade she would publish Disabled, Female, and Proud: Stories of Ten Women with Disabilities and make the film Positive Images: Portraits of Women with Disabilities. As a disabled rights activist worked for the United Nations Fourth International Conference on Women and used that experience to foster Beijing +5, a series of trainings for disabled women. She has also served on the board of Ms. magazine, the Center for Women Policy Studies, the Sister Fund, among others. In 2000 she was the recipient of the Jessie Bernard Wise Women Award.

The initial announcement of the Skyactiv technologies included new engines, transmissions, body, and chassis, which appeared in Mazda products from 2011. The Mazda Sky concept The precursor of Skyactiv, which featured a Mazda Sky-G 2.3-litre direct injection petrol engine, a Mazda Sky-D 2.2-litre diesel engine, a Sky-Drive automatic transmission, a Mazda Kiyora with Sky-G 1.3 engine and Sky-Drive automatic transmission, was unveiled at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show in 2008. The Skyactiv concept features a revised suspension geometry, improved automatic and manual transmission, and various improvements to Mazda's L- engine such as direct injection, upgraded exhaust manifold, increased compression ratio for cleaner burn and higher thermal efficiency, etc. Mazda's previous chassis for the Mazda 3 and Mazda 6 were carried over to the new vehicles. Skyactiv-G The Skyactiv-G or formerly Sky-G is a family of direct injection petrol engines. The engine compression ratio is increased to 14.0:1 To reduce the risk of engine knock at high compression, residual gas is reduced by using 4-2-1 engine exhaust systems, implementing a piston cavity, and optimizing fuel injection. In addition, combustion duration is shortened by intensifying air flow, increasing injection pressure, and using multi-hole injectors. It features an all-aluminum construction with chain- driven dual overhead camshafts with VVT and gasoline direct injection; with direct ignition, it meets ULEV emission standards. Skyactiv-G engines for the U.S. market have a lower compression ratio of 13:1 allowing them to operate on standard instead of premium fuel with an approximate 3-5 percent reduction in torque and fuel economy. = Generation 1 =  1.3 L  The Skyactiv-G 1.3 (P3-VPS) is a variant with engine displacement and features a bore and an stroke. The engine was unveiled at the 2011 Automotive Engineering Exposition. Five Mazda engineers were awarded the 2011 Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers Medal on April 20, 2012 specifically for the \\"development of a petrol engine (1.3 L) with a super-high compression ratio and achieving fuel efficiency of 30 km per litre (under Japan's 10-15 cycle)\\". The engine was first used in the Mazda2 13-Skyactiv. It is rated at 62 kW and 113 N¬∑m. Applications: * 2011‚Äìpresent Mazda Demio/Mazda2  1.5 L  The Skyactiv-G 1.5, or (PR-VP RS) for RWD applications and (P5 VPS F-P5) for FWD applications, is a engine with a bore and an stroke. This 4 cylinder engine was introduced in the 14MY Mazda3 for the Asian and European markets, it develops at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm (Asia Markets). This new petrol engine added to the Skyactiv line-up achieves a high compression ratio of 13.0:1 (14.0:1 in some markets). It greatly improves dynamic performance and fuel economy over the MZR 1.5 engine of the previous model. The Mazda MX-5 version of the engine in the Australian market with the same 13:1 compression ratio requires 95 RON fuel, has a higher redline and is rated at at 7,000 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. It also produces slightly more emissions and has slightly less fuel economy as a result.

In some markets, the and of torque with Flexifuel E85 is available. According to Mazda, it is more fuel efficient than the engine it replaces. Versus the engine in the 2011 Mazda3 (with an automatic transmission), they improved fuel economy from to in town, and from to on the highway compared to the 2011 model. The MX-5 ND2 2019 facelift received an updated engine producing with maximum RPM raised from 6800 to 7500 rpm and includes a larger intake manifold, increased injection pressure and a new exhaust system that scavenges the cylinders quicker.

Skyactiv-D Skyactiv-D (SH-VPTR) Diesel engine (For Mazda 6) Skyactiv-D is a family of turbocharged diesel engines, designed to comply with global emissions regulations. To eliminate the need of NOx and particulate treatment in contemporary diesel engines, the cylinder compression ratio is reduced to 14.0:1. Cold engine start is achieved via multi-hole piezo injectors with 3 programmable injection patterns, and adoption of ceramic glow plugs. Engine misfiring is prevented via variable valve lift at exhaust, which opens exhaust valves during the intake stroke, which increases engine air temperature. The Skyactiv-D also uses a two-stage turbocharger, in which one small and one large turbo are selectively operated, according to driving conditions. = S5-DPTS/S5-DPTR= Also known for Skyactiv-D 1.5 () engine was first introduced in the fourth generation Mazda Demio/Mazda2. It features a compression ratio of 14:1.

Applications: * 2018‚Äìpresent Mazda CX-3 * 2019‚Äìpresent Mazda3 * 2019‚Äìpresent Mazda CX-30 = SH-VPTS/SH-VPTR= Also known for Skyactiv-D 2.2 () engine is the first Skyactiv-D engine used in production vehicles. It was first used in the Mazda CX-5. In the Mazda6, it produces and . An upgraded version of the Skyactiv-D was run in the 2013 Rolex Sports Car Series season and helped Mazda win the GX manufacturer's championship. The engine is slated to be used again in two Lola LMP2s in the United SportsCar Series. = Unique Technology = The Skyactiv-D is the first low compression diesel in a production car, having a significantly lower compression in the first generation of 14:1 rather than higher compression ratios of 16:1 and higher. Numerous university studies have investigated the benefits of low compression diesel for decades, with the major benefit noted in single cylinder university tests of being a drastic reduction in NOx emissions, while also reducing particulate matter and combustion noise. These studies all concluded that while there were noticeable reductions in emissions, this came at the expense of difficult cold starts. Mazda resolved this in the Skyactitv-D by using piezoelectric fuel injectors with multiple nozzles that changes the pattern depending on operating conditions. Furthermore, exhaust valves are left slightly open as the engine starts causing exhaust gases to be sucked into the cylinders helping the engine to warm up quickly. = Early Issues = The CX-5 with Skyactiv-D engines were reported to have oil levels rising earlier than expected upon release, which required owners to check the vehicle's engine oil every 1000 kilometres or every month and return to the dealer if the oil appeared over the level of the dipstick. This procedure was initiated by Mazda worldwide as a precaution. Mazda did however resolve the issue in the first few months of the engine being available, with the resolution being a software change and a change of dipsticks with a corrected level. = Emission Standards = At launch in 2012, Mazda claimed the Skyactiv-D engine would only comply with Euro 5 emission standards (NOx of 0.18 g/km), and further work was required to achieve stricter emission standards. As a result, Mazda did not export the vehicle to the US. = Emissions Tested = In the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the Japanese government performed testing of all diesel engines produced in Japan to ensure Japanese manufacturers were not falsifying emissions as had been done by Volkswagen. It was determined that the Skyactiv-D engine was the only engine which tested at or near the standard. = Achieving US EPA emission standards = At the 2019 New York Motor show, Mazda announced that it would commence pre-sales of the 2019 CX-5 with the Skyactiv-D 2.2L engine. To achieve the US EPA emissions standards though has resulted is significant performance and economy penalties in comparison with the Euro 5 compliant engine. The Australian version of the engine is a good comparison with that in the US, with both countries requiring identical diesel quality and using the higher specification of the engine. The Euro stage V compliant Australian Skyactiv-D 2.2L has the following specifications: * Power: @ 4,500 rpm * Torque: @ 2,000 rpm * Fuel consumption (Australian ADR 81/02) ** Combined 5.7 L/100 km (41.3 mpg) ** City 6.5 L/100 km (36.2 mpg) ** Highway 5.2 L/100 km (45.2 mpg) The US EPA compliant US Skyactiv-D 2.2L has the following specifications: * Power: 168 hp @ 4,000 rpm * Torque: 290 lb-ft @ 2,000 rpm * EPA Estimated fuel economy: ** City 27 mpg ** Highway 30 mpg =Recall= In September 2016, Mazda recalled 130,000 vehicles in Japan over a defect that could lead to diesel engine failure. Although most problems were fixed later on the 2.2 suffered from bad carbon build up that would block the intake manifold. Other faults include the turbo diversion valve failure that required replacement of the complete twin turbo unit. Mazda recalled 2012 to 2018 diesel Mazda 3, Mazda 6 and CX-5 because of carbon deposits build-up. Skyactiv-Drive The Skyactiv-Drive is a family of automatic transmissions, named SKY-Drive. Mazda rejected dual-clutch technology in automatic transmissions, because the dual-clutch behavior in certain situations was sub-optimal. Instead, Mazda chose to re-design the conventional automatic transmission, making the torque converter take less duty while a multi-plate clutch disengages the torque converter most of the time. The new Skyactiv automatic transmission was designed to have six gears forward, one reverse gear, a short torque converter and a clutch integrated with the torque converter. Skyactiv-MT The Skyactiv-MT is a family of manual transmissions. To achieve lighter shift effort with a short shift lever stroke, the lever ratio is increased. However, to overcome the shorter internal stroke, a small module spline is used. Shift throws are reduced by 15 percent, making it the shortest shifting of any passenger car. To allow weight reduction, the triple-shafted gear train is made with reverse and first gears on the same shaft, and the use of a shorter secondary shaft. Skyactiv-Body The Skyactiv-Body is a next-generation, lightweight, highly-rigid car body, with improved crash safety performance. The Skyactiv-Body is 8% lighter and 30% more rigid than previous generations. Skyactiv-Hybrid The Skyactiv- Hybrid technology is an electric hybrid engine technology using Skyactiv-G engine with technology from Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive, originally licensed for use with Sky engine for vehicles sold in 2013. The first retail Mazda Skyactiv-Hybrid vehicle, a Mazda3 Skyactiv-Hybrid with Skyactiv-G 2.0 engine with 14:1 compression, was unveiled in 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. Skyactiv-CNG The Skyactiv-CNG engine is powered by compressed natural gas. The first retail Mazda Skyactiv-CNG prototype vehicle, a Mazda3 Skyactiv-CNG Concept, was unveiled in 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. Skyactiv-R The Skyactiv-R engine is Mazda's new generation rotary engine. However, the engine has never been shown to the public to prove its existence. The Mazda RX-Vision Concept, powered by a Skyactiv-R rotary engine, was unveiled in 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. Skyactiv-X Skyactiv-X cutaway Skyactiv-X is the first commercial petrol engine to use compression ignition, in which the fuel-air mixture ignites spontaneously when compressed by the piston. This allows it to operate much leaner than a spark ignition engine, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. This engine targets 20-30% greater fuel efficiency by utilising homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) technology. In order to handle ignition problems caused by compression ignition, each cylinder also incorporates a spark plug featuring Spark Controlled Compression Ignition (SPCCI) technology. SPCCI works by drawing in a lean, homogenous air-fuel mixture, it then compresses the mixture until it approaches the point at which it would spontaneously detonate. A second injector then adds a secondary charge of fuel directly on the spark plug. This secondary charge is ignited by the spark plug, causing the cylinder pressure to very quickly rise to a point where the rest of the fuel undergoes compression ignition. The presence of the spark plug allows the engine to also operate as a spark-ignition engine under some operating conditions, such as high-speed high-load situations.

Gradually the air escapes and a slow leak of pressure from the tire occurs. A common cause is failure to thoroughly clean the inside of the wheel and tire after the usage of emergency tire inflation applications such as \\"Fix-A-Flat.\\" Under certain conditions, technicians may be able to slow down the process by sanding down or smoothing out the target area of the wheel, but eventually the chrome peels even more and the tire loses pressure again.

An example can be seen at the Satria Mandala Museum in Jakarta.Museum Satria Mandala // Jakarta, Indonesia ¬´ Small Arms Defense Journal Overview The Type 100 and Type 1 weapons offer the advantage of two guns being mounted in the space occupied by one gun of the same size, thus saving weight in the gun and mount, and space in the plane. A small ammunition supply making frequent magazine loading necessary is a disadvantage, partially because of the advantages of the double barrel principle. This doubling concept is also used for the Type 89 machine gun and MG 81Z machine gun. The operation for both barrels is housed in a single receiver. This is a single forging, milled to house the two separate actions. The magazine opening is cut out of the top of the receiver, the ejection slot out of the bottom. Each action has its own back plate. The gas piston group action is based on ZB vz. 26 design. The bolt is a steel forging well machined. The gas cylinder tube is constructed of seamless steel tubing and is threaded to the receiver at the rear. The trigger assembly is made up of two separate sear assemblies riveted to the pistol grip framework. Two pistol grips are located about 6 inches apart, the sears are connected to a horizontal trigger bar mounting a trigger on either end. Both guns may be fired by depressing either trigger. The magazine is the saddle-drum magazine type. Each side holds 50 rounds and feeds one gun. Each side has its own spring so that, in the event of a jam affecting one barrel, the other gun may continue to fire. The Type 1 variant appears to be basically the same weapon as the earlier model, the Type 100. The Type 1 gun had a head or shoulder rest attached to the gun. This is not the same Type 1 machine gun as used by the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was a variant of the German MG 15 machine gun.

Life Jeppson was born on July 1, 1844 in H√∂gan√§s, Sweden. Jeppson‚Äôs father was a carpenter and several of his ancestors were mechanics. Jeppson went to school in his birthplace, but at the age of 12 went to work in a pottery and brick factory. At the age of 16 Jeppson learned how to manufacture architectural ornaments. He worked in the pottery and brick factory until the age of 24. Around the age of 25 he decided to try his luck to America. When he arrived in America he gained employment with Norton in Worcester, MA, which at this time only produced pottery. Jeppson became very skilled at his profession and earned the highest salaries. In 1873 Jeppson managed to produce an artificial emery stone. He continued his experiments and in 1885 the Norton Emery Wheel Company was created with Jeppson as one of the creators. Jeppson became the company‚Äôs first plant manager. Jeppson then went on to become the Chief Engineer of the Norton Emery Wheel Company. He maintained this position until his death in 1920. In 1916, Jeppson became a Knight First Class of the Royal Order of Vasa as appointed by the King of Sweden. Norton Company After John Jeppson‚Äôs death in 1920 the Norton Company began its expansion. The Norton Company opened up factories in Canada, France and Germany. At the time of Jeppson‚Äôs death Norton Company had twelve employees and two ovens. After the expansion of the Norton Company in Worcester the company now had multiple buildings and a huge complex consisting of some 50 buildings. His son George Jeppson and grandson John Jeppson II would continue the family legacy at Norton, both serving as president and CEO.

A coastal exclave in the western part of the island of Timor, Oecusse is separated from the rest of East Timor by West Timor, which is part of the province of Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia, and which surrounds Oecusse in all directions except the north, where it borders the Savu Sea. The capital of Oecusse is Pante Macassar, also called Oecussi Town, or formerly, in Portuguese Timor, Vila Taveiro. Originally Ambeno was the name of the former district and Oecussi its capital. Geography =Overview= Mountains near Sacato, suco of Nipane Oecusse has an area of . =Climate= Oecusse has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen Aw) with a hot, humid and uncomfortable wet season from December to April and a hot, less humid dry season from May to November. History Oecusse and Ambeno are the names of the two original kingdoms, of which Ambeno existed before the colonial period. Oecusse was among the first parts of the island of Timor on which the Portuguese established themselves, and is thus usually considered the cradle of East Timor. In about 1556, the Dominican friar Ant√≥nio Taveiro, operating from a base on Solor, started missionary work on the north coast of Timor. Shortly after this, in 1569, the village of \\"Alifao\\" (Lifau) is mentioned on a European map. It was situated five kilometres to the west of modern Pante Macassar.Fr√©d√©ric Durand, Timor: 1250-2005, 750 ans de cartographie et de voyage. Toulouse: Arkuiris 2006, p. 65. For the Portuguese traders in sandalwood, Lifau was a convenient place to land since it was situated to the south of their base in the Solor Archipelago. The area was dominated by the Ambeno kingdom, which was sometimes referred as the kingdom of Lifau. In 1641 the Dominican priests baptised the royal families of the Ambeno, Mena and Amanuban kingdoms, which meant that Portuguese influence increased in parts of western Timor. Migration of Topasses, a Eurasian population, rose in the 1650s from Larantuka on Flores. After 1664 they were governed by officers belonging to the Hornay and Da Costa families, and were able to dominate most of Timor. The Topass leaders used Lifau as their main stronghold on Timor, but still resided much of their time in Larantuka. In the second half of the seventeenth century they made great profits through the sandalwood trade, attracting merchants from Siam, Batavia, Macao, and Goa in India. The precious wood was brought to Lifau and sold to external traders under Topass supervision.Hans H√§gerdal, 'Rebellions or factionalism? Timorese forms of resistance in an early colonial context, 1650-1769', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 163:1 2007, pp. 10-14. In 1702, Lifau became the authorised capital of the colony when it received the first governor from Goa. The following period saw frequent clashes between the governor and the independent-minded Topasses, who had their strongholds in Tulic√£o west of Lifau, and Animata in the inland. Under their leader Gaspar da Costa they attacked the Dutch colonial post at Kupang in 1749 but were smashingly defeated, and subsequently moved their residence to Pante Macassar (Oecusse) in 1759 due to Dutch military pressure. The capital of the governor was transferred from Lifau to Dili in 1769, because of the frequent attacks from the Topass leader Francisco Hornay III. Most of West Timor was left to Dutch forces, who were conquering what is today Indonesia. The Eurasian leadership of Oecusse by and by turned into a Timorese kingship, and members of the Hornay and Da Costa families reigned as Liurai (kings) until modern times. They regularly intermarried with the Ambeno royalty. In the 1780s a reconciliation took place between the governor in Dili and the Topasses, who henceforth usually supported the Portuguese government.C.R. Boxer, The Topasses of Timor. Amsterdam: Indisch Instituut te Amsterdam 1947. In 1859, with the Treaty of Lisbon, Portugal and the Netherlands divided the island between them. West Timor became Dutch, with its colonial seat at Kupang, and East Timor became Portuguese, with its seat in Dili. This left Oecusse and Noimuti as enclaves surrounded by Dutch territory. In 1912 the Liurai of Ambeno, Jo√£o da Cruz, staged a revolt against the Portuguese. It was quickly put down, after which the Ambeno kingdom lapsed. The Liurai of Oecusse became dominant in the entire Oecusse exclave.R. Pelissier, Timor en guerre: Le crocodile et les portugais (1847-1913). Orgeval 1996, pp. 274-277, 299-301. The definitive border was drawn by the Hague in 1916. Apart from Japanese occupation during World War II, the border remained the same until the end of the colonial period. The region was given the status of county (conselho), named Oec√∫ssi, by the Portuguese government in August 1973, the last Timorese area to receive it. Indonesian forces invaded Oecusse on 6 June 1975. In October they occupied the western border districts of East Timor's main territory. It was in Pante Macassar that an Indonesian fifth column raised the Indonesian flag on 29 November 1975, a week before the official Indonesian invasion of East Timor proper. However, even under Indonesian rule, Oecusse was administered as part of the province of East Timor, as it had been as part of Portuguese Timor. Like much of the country, it suffered violent attacks near the 1999 referendum for independence. Over 90 percent of the infrastructure was destroyed. It became part of the independent state of East Timor on 20 May 2002. In the 1970s and 1980s, New Zealander anarchist Bruce Grenville began a hoax, claiming to have founded the sultanate of Occussi- Ambeno. He invented a history for the state of tribes united against the Portuguese, and produced many cinderella stamps for his creation. On 11 November 1999, 600+ Australian troops from 3RAR (Third Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment) deployed from Maliana in East Timor proper to Oecusse to liberate the enclave. They stayed there until late February 2000, being replaced by Jordanian troops. Politics Articles 5 and 71 of the 2002 constitution provide that Oetcussi Ambeno be governed by a special administrative policy and economic regime. Law 03/2014 of 18 June 2014 created the Special Administrative Region of Oecusse Ambeno (Regi√£o Administrativa Especial de Oecusse Ambeno, RAEOA). A national development programme to implement governmental policy, called ZEESM TL (Special Zones of Social Market Economy of Timor-Leste) is in place. The President of RAEOA & ZEESM TL is Mari Alkatiri, a former Prime Minister of East Timor. The East Timor government that established the ZEESM TL programme was hoping that it would bring economic sustainability before the country's oil and gas reserves run out. During a visit to Oecusse in November 2015, the then Prime Minister, Rui Maria de Ara√∫jo, claimed that the government's investment in the Region would benefit all people in East Timor, not just those in Oecusse. However, there has been criticism of the programme's lack of transparency and accountability, and its absence of any public cost-benefit or risk analysis, or any significant private investment. Questions have also been raised as to whether the programme is one that is necessarily appropriate for the area, or likely to be in the best interests of its citizens. According to one commentator, many observers of East Timor's strategic investment choices have wondered, \\"Why is the government of a country [largely] subsistence farmers obsessed with glitzy prestige projects at the expense of more pressing needs such as health and agriculture?\\" Yet the same commentator has also noted, more recently, that the imposition of the programme generated a plurality of opinions and reactions in Oecusse, mostly eliciting curiosity and the will to cautiously negotiate solutions. Not only did the local population adapt to the programme and endure significant changes in their lifestyles; additionally, some aspects of the programme were modified in some significant detail to accommodate deep and strongly expressed popular sentiments. Administrative posts Subdivisions of Oecusse Cities and rivers of Oecusse Oecusse is divided into four administrative posts (formerly sub-districts): * Nitibe * Oesilo * Pante Macassar (with capital Pante Macassar) * Passabe The administrative posts are divided into 18 sucos (\\"villages\\") in total. Demographics =Population= According to the 2015 Census, Oecusse has a population of 68,913 people, divided into 14,345 households. The Atoni, one of many indigenous ethnic groups, number about 20,000 in the SAR. A much larger number live in the surrounding part of West Timor. =Languages= The native language of most residents is Uab Meto (Meto), often referred to by outsiders as Baikeno. Portuguese is used in education and government, although despite its status as an official language there are few fluent speakers. Although Indonesian was used as a lingua franca until 1999, since then it has been almost completely replaced in this role by Tetum which is the primary language of government, education and public life and is spoken and understood in all but very remote areas of the SAR. =Religion= 99.3% of the inhabitants are Roman Catholic and 0.6% Protestant. There were 36 Hindus, 21 Muslims, 10 Animists and one Buddhist in the 2010 census. Transport The Berlin Nakroma =Air= The new Oecusse or Rota do Sandalo International Airport was inaugurated by East Timorese President Francisco Guterres on 18 June 2019 and serves as the main gateway to Oecusse. The airport was previously an airstrip located at the edge of Pante Macassar and was refurbished at a cost of US$119 million. Previously, there were six return flights a week to and from the East Timor capital Dili. =Road= Main roads link Pante Macassar to Sakato 15 km (10 miles) to the east, and Bobometo to the south-east, both of which are on the East Timor-Indonesia border and are official border crossings into Indonesia. The integrated border post at Sakato (also spelled Sacato) is the major crossing for Oecusse as it is on the shortest land route between Oecusse and East Timor proper via the border crossing at Mota'ain/Batugade. The Indonesian checkpoint across the border from Sakato is Wini. The Bobometo border crossing (with Napan on the Indonesian side) in on the road to Kefamenanu. A network of minor roads link other areas within Oecusse Municipality with Pante Macassar and the capitals of administrative posts. On 12 June 2017 a bridge over the Tono River was inaugurated by the president of Timor-Leste, Francisco Guterres. The Noefefan Bridge connects the isolated regions to the west of the Tono River to Pante Macassar, providing them permanent access to markets, the ferry and airport, even during the rainy season (November to April). Roads also lead to minor border crossings in Passabe (with Haumeniana also in North Central Timor Regency) and Citrana (with Oepoli in Kupang Regency), mostly catering to crossings by residents of border villages. =Sea= The ferry Berlin Nakroma connects Oecusse to Dili, arriving twice a week on a journey which takes 12 hours.

All India reporter , Volume 3, 1955 In the colonial age, the British enacted several laws which defined rights and obligations of Inamdar in their territories, like the Madras Inams Act VIII of 1869.

By the time of the American Revolutionary War he had risen to the rank of colonel. Promoted to brigadier general, he was assigned to command the elite Brigade of Guards in the American campaign. In 1776 he led the Guards at Long Island, Kip's Bay, and Fort Washington where he spearheaded one of the assault forces. In the Philadelphia Campaign, he commanded his brigade at Brandywine, Germantown, White Marsh, and Monmouth. As a major general, he took part in the highly successful Chesapeake raid on Virginia ports in 1779. He led one of the columns in action at Battle of Springfield in 1780. He commanded in the West Indes in 1782 and became a full general in 1797. His beloved daughter Anna predeceased him in 1795. Mathew is likely to have been the model for a character in one of Jane Austen's novels. Early career Born in 1729, Mathew became an ensign in the Regiment of Coldstream Guards (2nd Foot Guards) in 1746.Boatner, 685 In 1760 he married Lady Jane Bertie (d. 21 August 1793), daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.archive.org Royal Lineage By the year 1775 he was a colonel and aide de camp to King George III. He was appointed commander of the brigade of Guards in America with the rank of brigadier general. Mathew is described as \\"generous, full of honors, kind\\". However, he had a darker side that had a \\"bitter, stiff, and dictatorial presence\\". Though he dearly loved his daughter Anna, he could also erupt into a despotic rage. Because he was father-in-law to Jane Austen's brother James, he is supposed to have inspired the character General Tilney in her novel Northanger Abbey.First Foot Guards American Revolutionary War The British army formed the 1,000-strong Brigade of Guards by selecting the men by lottery from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Foot Guards Regiments. The brigade was split into two battalions of about 500 troops each. Other regiments of foot assigned their light and grenadier companies to converged elite battalions, leaving only the eight line companies to fight with the parent unit. The Guards Brigade, however, retained its two flank companies.McGuire (2006), 33 The grenadier company and the line companies of Hyde, Wrottesley, Cox, and Garth became the 1st Guards Battalion, while the light company and the line companies of Stephen, Murray, O'Hara, and Martin were assigned to the 2nd Guards Battalion. A detailed organization down to the company level can be found in the Brandywine order of battle.McGuire (2006), 379 Lieutenant Colonel Sir George Osborn, 4th Baronet commanded the grenadier companyMcGuire (2006), 6 while Captain Thomas Twistleton led the light company.McGuire (2006), 37 Sir George Osborn was one of a number of aristocratic officers in Mathew's Guards Brigade The Guards Brigade landed on Long Island on 22 August 1776 and was present in the Battle of Long Island five days later.Burke & Bass, Guards in the American service On 15 September the Guards Brigade took part in the Battle of Kip's Bay, landing in the first wave. Mathew played a significant role at the Battle of Fort Washington on 16 November. With two light infantry battalions under his leadership, he boated across the Harlem River near what is now 200th Street and established a bridgehead. This effort was followed up by Lord Charles Cornwallis with the Guards Brigade, two grenadier battalions, and the 33rd Foot. The advance of this and other columns resulted in a resounding British victory including the capture of 2,818 Americans.Boatner, 387‚Äì388 After the American victory at Trenton, the 1st Guards Battalion was assigned to Cornwallis for the Princeton Campaign in early January 1777. However, Mathew stayed behind with the 2nd Battalion in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The Guards were involved in several skirmishes during the Forage War. The grenadier and light companies of the Guards were in action at the Battle of Short Hills on 26 June 1777 where one of their officers was mortally wounded.McGuire (2006), 54‚Äì56 On the 29th, the British army abruptly abandoned New Jersey.McGuire (2006), 61 Sir William Howe sailed with his army from New York on 23 July. At the end of August, the British troops landed at Head of Elk, Maryland at the north end of Chesapeake Bay.Boatner, 858‚Äì859 Among the Guards officers present during the subsequent Philadelphia Campaign were Captain-lieutenant Richard FitzPatrick of the 1st Foot Guards,McGuire (2006), 35 Colonel Charles O'Hara of the 2nd Foot Guards, and Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Wrottesley.McGuire (2006), 69 On 11 September 1777 at the Battle of Brandywine, Mathew's brigade joined the flanking column under Howe and Cornwallis. This body of troops reached a position behind the American right flank before it was discovered. The Guards Brigade deployed on the right of the first line around 4:00 PM. Osborn commanded both the grenadier company on the right and the light company which deployed as skirmishers in front.McGuire (2006), 204‚Äì205 The Guards faced two Maryland brigades under the command of Major General John Sullivan. Because Sullivan was also the American right-wing commander, he left the Marylanders in charge of the senior officer, Brigadier General Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre. Attempting to shift the troops to the right, de Borre bungled his assignment, throwing his lines into disarray.McGuire (2006), 222 The attack of the Guards brushed aside their confused opponents. The brigade reported only one killed, five wounded, and two missing, including one casualty from the grenadiers and three from the light company.McGuire (2006), 225 Battle of Germantown, 11 September 1777 The evening before the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Howe alerted Osborn of a possible attack and ordered the Guard Brigade's grenadier and light companies to support the Queen's Rangers on the right flank. In the morning they were attacked by a force of Maryland and New Jersey militia. The militia effort quickly collapsed, allowing the British to wheel to their left to outflank a brigade of Connecticut continentals.McGuire (2007), 105‚Äì109 At some point in the action, Mathew led forward the line companies of the Guards Brigade to reinforce Osborn's flank companies.McGuire (2007), 51 map During the Battle of White Marsh in December 1777, the Guards light company under Captain Twistleton fought with the army's vanguard at Edge Hill.McGuire (2007), 245‚Äì250 In early 1778 Mathew was promoted to the \\"local rank\\" of major general. Sir George Collier Mathew led his brigade at the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778. At Monmouth, Colonel Harry Trelawny led the 502-man 1st Guards Battalion while Lieutenant Colonel James Ogilvie commanded the 480-strong 2nd Guards Battalion.Morrissey, 84 Trelawny was wounded and about 40 casualties were inflicted when some of Anthony Wayne's troops under Lieutenant Colonels Walter Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey fired on the Guards while concealed in a wood. Joined by the 1st Grenadier Battalion, the Guards quickly flushed the Americans out of the trees.Morrissey, 69 General Henry Clinton fitted out a joint navy and army expedition in the spring of 1779. Under Commodore Sir George Collier and Mathew, the force sailed from New York City on 5 May and reached Hampton Roads four days later.Boatner, 1149 When the expedition approached Fort Nelson near Norfolk, Virginia, its 100-man American garrison under Major Thomas Matthews immediately decamped and retreated toward the Great Dismal Swamp.Boatner, 385 On 11 May, the British force occupied Norfolk, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and the Gosport Shipyard. The Americans burned a 28-gun frigate and two French merchantmen to prevent their capture. Besides seizing enormous amounts of tobacco, naval cannons, and marine supplies, the British burned or captured 137 ships. The damage inflicted on the state of Virginia in the Chesapeake raid was estimated at ¬£2,000,000. Mathew and Collier returned to New York in triumph, having suffered no loss of life. The Guards Brigade joined Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen's 5,000 raid on New Jersey on 7 June 1780. Mathew was one of six brigade commanders employed on the expedition. After the initial attack stalled, the British- Hessian force lunged forward again on 23 June to bring on the Battle of Springfield. While Knyphausen hammered at Springfield Bridge, he sent Mathew with half his force in a flanking move via Vauxhall Bridge. Colonel Israel Angell's 2nd Rhode Island Regiment held back Knyphausen's column for 40 minutes as Brigadier General William Maxwell and Major Light Horse Harry Lee delayed Mathew's envelopment. At length, Major General Nathanael Greene had to commit additional troops to block Mathew's turning movement. In the face of strong resistance, Knyphausen called off the operation in the afternoon and returned to Staten Island.Boatner, 1045‚Äì1047 Mathew left North America for England later in 1780. Later career Jane Austen may have used Mathew as a model for one of her characters. In November 1782, Mathew was appointed commander-in-chief in the West Indes. In 1779, Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing's French fleet had seized Grenada from the British. At the end of the conflict, the island was restored to Great Britain and its new governor Mathew reported that the local fortifications on Richmond Hill were in a \\"ruinous condition\\". The old French fortifications were completely replaced by new works called Forts Frederick, Adolphus, Lucas, and Mathew. Much of the construction labor was performed by the 300-strong Carolina Corps, a military unit formed from African-American slaves freed and recruited by the British army. A report from 1787 stated that progress on the forts was satisfactory.Zimmerman, Fort Mathew Mathew was promoted to full general in 1797. While on his second tour as Governor of Grenada, King George forgot to have the Treasury approve his salary. Despite his innocence, Mathew was billed by the government in 1792 for the ¬£11,000 that he was paid as his legitimate wage. By this time, the king was suffering from fits of madness and could not confirm details such as whether he authorized Mathew's salary. After his death the family had to pay back ¬£23,000 to the Royal Exchequer. On 27 March 1792, James Austen married Mathew's daughter Anne. James' first wife had died, and he was anxious to remarry. Anne, then 30 years old, was considered a spinster. The couple had one child in 1793, Jane Anna Elizabeth. Though Mathew helped support the couple who lived on James' ¬£300 yearly wage as a clergyman, the two ran through their funds quickly. The general purchased the rank of chaplain in the 86th Foot Regiment so that his son-in-law could live on the salary. However, Anna died very suddenly on 3 May 1795.austenprose.com Jane Austen's Siblings Mathew died on 25 December 1805.

Although he was a hard-driving, aggressive panzer commander early in the war, Model became best known as a practitioner of defensive warfare. His relative success as commander of the Ninth Army in the retreats of 1941‚Äì1942 determined his future career path. He has been called the Third Reich's best defensive tactical commander. Model first came to Hitler's attention before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and loyalty to the Nazi regime won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him one of his best field commanders and repeatedly sent him to salvage apparently desperate situations on the Eastern Front. Their relationship broke down by the end of the war after the German defeat at the Battle of the Bulge. In the aftermath of the encirclement and defeat of Army Group B at the Ruhr Pocket, Model committed suicide on 21 April 1945.  Early life and career  Model's decision to burn all his personal papers at the end of World War II means relatively little is known about his early years. Born to a music teacher in Genthin, Saxony, he belonged to a lower-middle class, non-military family. Following schooling at the B√ºrgerschule (citizen school) in Genthin, he graduated with his Abitur from the Domgymnasium Naumburg, a humanities- oriented secondary school, on Easter 1909. He entered the army officer cadet school (Kriegsschule) in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in 1909, where he was an unexceptional student, and was commissioned a lieutenant (Leutnant) in the 52nd Infantry Regiment von Alvensleben in 1910. He made few friends among his fellow officers and soon became known for his ambition, drive, and blunt outspokenness. These were characteristics that would mark his entire career. = World War I = In World War I, the 52nd Infantry Regiment formed part of the 5th Division which fought on the Western Front. Model served as the adjutant of his regiment's 1st Battalion. In May 1915, he was severely wounded near Arras, and in October he won the Iron Cross, First Class. His deeds brought him to the attention of his divisional commander who, despite misgivings about his \\"uncomfortable subordinate\\", recommended Model for a posting on the German General Staff. Among other things, this meant that Model took part in only the initial stages of the Battle of Verdun and escaped the carnage of the Battle of the Somme, to which his division was committed in his absence. Model completed the abbreviated staff officers' course and returned to the 5th Division as adjutant of the 10th Infantry Brigade, followed by postings as a company commander in both the 52nd Infantry Regiment and the 8th Life Grenadiers. He was promoted to captain (Hauptmann) in November 1917, and in 1918 was assigned to the staff of the Guard Ersatz Division, which fought in the German Spring Offensive of that year. He ended the war with the 36th Reserve Division. = Inter-war years = By the end of the war, Model had gained a reputation as a capable officer with great potential. Early on in his military career, Model had written a book on the Prussian general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. In addition, he was already known to Hans von Seeckt, head of the slimmed-down Reichswehr, from his staff postings during the war, and he was equipped with an excellent reference from Major-General Franz von Rantau, commander of the 36th Reserve Division. It was thus no surprise that he was one of the 4,000 officers retained in the Reichswehr. Model generally kept away from politics in the chaotic period that marked the birth of the Weimar Republic, although as an army officer he was involved in the bloody suppression of the 1920 communist uprising in the Ruhr. The next year he married Herta Huyssen; they would have three children, Christa, Hella, and Hansgeorg. Model hated war stories and never discussed politics or the war with his wife. In 1925, Model was posted to the 3rd Infantry Division, an elite formation of the Reichswehr and one that was heavily involved in testing the technical innovations of that era. From 1928, he lectured in tactics and war studies for the basic General Staff training course, and in 1930 he was transferred to the Training Branch of the Truppenamt. He became known both for his enthusiastic support of military modernisation and for his complete lack of tact. In 1938, the year he became a major general (Generalmajor), he led a testfiring of the M√∂rser 18 on mocked-up Czech fortifications, which did not impress Hitler. As were many army officers at the time, Model was a supporter of the Nazi government; his time in Berlin also brought him into contact with senior members of the Nazi regime. Closer relationships with Goebbels and Speer developed during the war.  World War II  Model (centre) on the Eastern Front, July 1941 Model spent the first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the invasion of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff‚Äîwho often had to clean up the mess he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms training programme where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later on, it was still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941. = Invasion of the Soviet Union = Model with the overall commander of the 2nd Panzer Army and his direct superior Heinz Guderian during Barbarossa, 1941 For Operation Barbarossa, the 3rd Panzer Division was assigned to the XXIV Panzer Corps, itself part of the 2nd Panzer Group, commanded by Heinz Guderian. The campaign opened on 22 June 1941, with Guderian urging his divisions forward at breakneck speed. This suited Model, and by 4 July, his advance elements leading the panzer group's charge had reached the Dnieper, an exploit that earned him the Knight's Cross. Crossing it in strength was another matter, however, as the Red Army was prepared to defend the river line. 3rd Panzer's vanguard was thrown back by the Soviet 21st Army, and it was not until 10 July that the Germans were in a position to force a crossing. For this operation, Model, now reinforced with additional troops, reorganized his command into three groups: an infantry- heavy force that would cross the river and establish a bridgehead, a mobile armoured group that would pass through the bridgehead and continue the advance, and a fire support group containing nearly all his artillery. The plan worked so successfully that the river crossing cost scarcely any casualties. There followed two weeks of hard fighting to defend the panzer group's flank, during which he was assigned the 1st Cavalry Division in addition to 3rd Panzer as Gruppe Model, who then attacked to break up Soviet forces massing near Roslavl. After the fall of Smolensk, Hitler ordered a change of direction, and Guderian's panzer group turned south into Ukraine. Its objective was to trap the Soviet forces defending Kiev, an unsupported advance of 275 km (172 mi), and again 3rd Panzer would form the spearhead. From 24 August to 14 September, Model conducted a lightning thrust into the rear of the Soviet Southwestern Front. The manoeuver reached its conclusion when 3rd Panzer made contact with the 16th Panzer Division from Army Group South at Lokhvitsa. While it would take several more days to eliminate all resistance, the trap around Kiev had been closed. = Before Moscow = The German advance during Operation Barbarossa, June to December 1941 Shortly thereafter, Model was promoted to General der Panzertruppe (general) and placed in command of XLI Panzer Corps, which was embroiled in Operation Typhoon, the assault on Moscow. The attack had begun on 2 October 1941, and Model arrived at his new command on 14 November, in the midst of the battle. The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, was located at Kalinin, 160 km (100 mi) northwest of Moscow. It was worn out, at the end of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40 ¬∞C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations. Just as the Germans had made the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts launched a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some of the closest penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout. During this period, Model noticed that the Soviet attack‚Äîhuman wave attacks with poor tactical coordination‚Äîtended to be most successful when the Germans employed a strongpoint defence instead of a continuous line. Moreover, Soviet logistics were still inadequate to support a fast-moving battle; thus, even if a gap was made, it did not automatically mean a crisis. Therefore, he ordered his men to spread themselves out, which exploited his corps' advantage in artillery over the Soviets, while he created small mechanized kampfgruppen to deal with any breakthrough. His tactics were successful, if costly (by the end of 1941, 6th Panzer Division mustered 1,000 men, including all frontline, support and staff personnel). He would continue to advocate similar tactics throughout the remainder of his career. = Rzhev = Model's success in holding his front had not gone unnoticed, and in January 1942 he was placed in charge of the Ninth Army occupying the Rzhev salient, leapfrogging at least 15 more senior commanders in Army Group Centre alone. Just prior to his departure for the front, the new army commander had held lengthy consultations with both Hitler and Halder. They impressed upon Model that great firmness would be necessary to save the army from destruction, and his vehement tone in reply so impressed Hitler that upon the General's departure he remarked: \\"Did you see that eye? I trust that man to do it, but I wouldn't want to serve under him\\". When Model took over, his sector was in a shambles: the Kalinin Front had broken through the line and was threatening the Moscow‚ÄìSmolensk railway, the main supply route for Army Group Centre. Despite the danger, he realized the precarious position the attackers themselves were in and immediately counterattacked, cutting off the Soviet 39th Army. To hold the line Model threw every available men to the front, drafting construction units and the like to replenish the enormous German losses. In the ferocious battles that followed, he repelled multiple Soviet attempts to relieve their trapped soldiers, the last being in February. He then squeezed out the pocket at his leisure, in a series of operations culminating in mid-July. For this, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross and promoted to colonel general (Generaloberst). Having restored Ninth Army's front, Model set about holding it. His defensive doctrine, which combined conventional thinking with his own tactical innovations, was based on the following principles: * Up-to-date intelligence, based on frontline sources and reconnaissance instead of relying on reports from rear-area analysts. * A continuous front line, no matter how thinly held. * Tactical reserves to halt any imminent breakthrough. * Centralized artillery command and control. Since the end of World War I, German divisions had had their artillery spread out amongst their component regiments, which made it difficult to bring the maximum weight of fire to bear on any one point. Model reorganized his artillery into special battalions under the direct control of the divisional and corps commanders. * Multiple static lines of defence, to delay the enemy's advance. Hitler had in fact forbidden the construction of multiple lines, saying that soldiers would be tempted to abandon their current line in favour of falling back to the next; Model ignored this order. The expediency of preparing rearward defense lines, although these went against the express wishes of Hitler, meant that Model's influence was felt even when he was absent from the battlefield. At the end of July 1942 the front erupted as a new Soviet offensive tore through the German defence at Rzhev. Model was on convalescent leave, having been hit by a chance rifle shot whilst flying over the front, and General von Vietinghoff was in temporary command. Model returned to Ninth Army on the 10 August and immediately made his presence felt. He ordered the creation of scratch battle groups made up of soldiers returning from leave and threw them into the fighting. At almost exactly the same time he forcefully demanded extra divisions from Kluge at Army Group headquarters, or \\"provide detailed instructions as to how the battle is to be continued.\\"Ziemke, Moscow to Stalingrad. By the close of September, the Soviet offensive was temporarily spent, but Zhukov, unhappy with the results of the summer and still aware of opportunities around the Rzhev salient, would try again with even more force in November. Code named Operation Mars, Soviet forces struck simultaneously at the Ninth Army from four directions. Model's defensive abilities were once again put to the test, and his forces were once again able to contain and then cut off and destroy Soviet spearheads, even though the German losses were again extensive. Model emerged from a year of fighting around Rzhev with an enhanced reputation as a \\"Lion of defense\\" (L√∂we der Abwehr\\"). Liddell Hart wrote that he had \\"the amazing capability to collect a reserve from an almost empty battlefield\\". Ninth Army eventually evacuated the salient in Operation B√ºffel in March 1943, as part of a general shortening of the line. Large-scale anti-partisan sweeps were carried out in the weeks before the operation (the army's sector was a hotbed for partisan activity), in which an estimated 3,000 Russians were killed, the great majority of whom were unarmed, as shown by the inventory of the seized weapons: 277 rifles, 41 pistols, 61 machine guns, 17 mortars, 9 antitank rifles and 16 small artillery pieces. The withdrawal itself was precisely planned and took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces. In its wake, Model personally ordered the deportation of all male civilians, wells poisoned, and at least two dozen villages razed in a scorched earth policy to hinder the Red Army's follow up in the area. The official Soviet report published on 7 April 1943 showed the effects of the German policy. In Viazma, out of 5,500 buildings, only 51 small houses were still standing; at Gzhatsk, 300 out of 1,600; in Rzhev, 500 out of 5,400. 15,000 people were deported from the three towns alone. The rural areas suffered equally; in the Sychevka area, for example, 137 villages out of 248 had been burned down. British war correspondent Alexander Werth visited the area soon after the liberation and saw for himself the results of Model's orders. The report listed Model at the top of the list of the war criminals responsible for the \\"deliberate extermination policy\\" and noted that most of the killings of civilians were carried out by regular Wehrmacht units, not just the Gestapo or the SD. In the same month, Model received the Swords to his Knight's Cross, and Ninth Army received orders to move into Orel. = Kursk and Orel = German armoured vehicles during Operation Citadel, summer 1943 On 5 July 1943, Model led the northern assault on Kursk during Operation Citadel, a plan which had caused great controversy within the German high command. G√ºnther von Kluge and Erich von Manstein, commanding Army Groups Centre and South respectively, had originally urged that the salient be attacked in May, before the Soviets could prepare their defences. Others, including Heinz Guderian, felt that attacking was unnecessary, since it would occasion heavy tank losses and thus upset plans for increasing German armored strength. Model was also skeptical of the plan's chances, pointing out that Konstantin Rokossovsky's Central Front was strongly dug in and outnumbered him two to one in men, tanks and artillery. Rather than conclude that the offensive be called off, however, he said it should be postponed until he could receive further reinforcements, in particular the new Panther tanks and Ferdinand tank destroyers. Model's true opinion on the value of the offensive remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack. Model's assault was a failure, as Ninth Army quickly became enmeshed in the elaborate Soviet fortifications. The Red Army's strength in the salient was, in fact, growing much faster than that of the attacking force. Nor did his tactical plan of attack meet with great success. Having less armour and more artillery than Manstein in the south, and fearing that the deep Soviet defences would stall an armour-heavy attack (the hallmark of the German Blitzkrieg), he decided to use his infantry to breach Rokossovsky's line before unleashing his armour. It did not work. The Germans took heavy losses to advance less than 12 km (8 mi) in seven days, and were unable to break through to open ground. Model threw his armour into the fray, but with little effect, beyond incurring more casualties. (As mitigating factors, the Red Army had concentrated more of their strength facing Model in the north; and Rokossovsky had correctly anticipated where the attack would come, defending that sector heavily. Model's use of infantry assaults also meant his losses in armour were lower than those of Manstein.) Prior to Kursk, Model had anticipated the possibility of a Soviet attack into the Orel Salient, and had (without OKH's knowledge) constructed extensive defensive works to meet such an attack. Following the stalling of his advance, the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov, duly opened on 12 July. It involved not just Rokossovsky's Central Front, but also the Bryansk and Western Fronts, a greater concentration of forces than Model had assaulted in Operation Citadel. For the battle, Kluge placed him in command of Second Panzer Army in addition to Ninth Army‚Äîagain, a larger total force than he had commanded in Citadel. The Soviet preponderance of strength was such that Stavka expected it to take only 48 hours to reach Orel, splitting the German forces into three parts; instead, the battle ended three weeks later with Model's orderly withdrawal from the salient. An idea of the scale of the fighting compared to Citadel can be gained from the combined casualty lists for Second Panzer and Ninth Armies: from 1 to 10 July, the Germans took 21,000 casualties, and from 11 to 31 July, 62,000. Despite these losses he had inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the three Red Army Fronts, shortened the line, and avoided annihilation. Similar to Rzhev withdrawal, Model ordered his troops to carry out the same scorched earth policy in the Orel salient, destroying the infrastructure and harvest, and deporting 250,000 civilians in inhuman conditions. After the loss of Orel, Model withdrew to the Dnieper as the Red Army went on the offensive from Smolensk in the north to Rostov in the south. He was relieved of command of the Ninth Army at the end of September, and took the opportunity to go on three months' leave in Dresden with his family. = Estonia = Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, August 1943 to December 1944 Model's relief is believed not to have been a sign that he had lost Hitler's confidence, but rather that he had gained it, the F√ºhrer wanting him available should another emergency break out which needed his attention. Thus, on 31 January 1944, he was urgently sent to command Army Group North, which, two weeks earlier, had seen its stranglehold on Leningrad broken by the Volkhov, Leningrad and 2nd Baltic Fronts. The situation was dire: the Eighteenth Army had been shattered into three parts and on the same time, the front had virtually dissolved. The army group's previous commander, Georg von K√ºchler, had pleaded for permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage. Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on other areas of the front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others say they were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent‚Äîto pull back to the Panther Line. Regardless, the \\"temporary\\" loss of ground usually became permanent, as Model conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Panther Line. He delegated responsibility for the Narva front to Johannes Friessner commanding Army Detachment Narva, while he concentrated on extricating Eighteenth Army from its predicament. Without OKH's notice or approval, he constructed a series of interim defensive lines to cover its retreat, slowing down and inflicting heavy losses on the pursuing Soviet forces in the process. By 1 March, the withdrawal was complete. His forces were mostly intact, but the fighting had been fierce: his Shield and Sword counter-attacks alone had cost him some 10,000‚Äì12,000 men. These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, but they kept the Red Army off-balance and won Model time to pull his units back. They also allowed him to say to Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west. On 1 March Model was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall. His rise from colonel to field marshal had taken just six years. = Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland = German vehicles abandoned during the 9th Army's retreat from Belarus, July 1944 On 30 March 1944, Model was placed in command of Army Group North Ukraine in Galicia, which was withdrawing under heavy pressure from Zhukov's 1st Ukrainian Front. He replaced Manstein, who had fallen out of favour with Hitler. Despite Manstein's previous victories, the F√ºhrer wanted someone whom he anticipated would be unyielding in defence. On 28 June, Model was sent to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet offensive in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army to break out of its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The general consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late. Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still hoped to re-establish the front to the west of the city, with the aid of divisions from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, and he had been driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to hold the line east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy. At various times in 1944, Model commanded each of the three major army groups on the Eastern Front, and for a short period in the middle of the year was commanding both Army Groups Centre and North Ukraine simultaneously. = Normandy = Remains of a German convoy destroyed near Falaise On 17 August 1944, Model received from Hitler Diamonds to go with his Knight's Cross with Oakleaves and Swords, in reward for his shoring up of the Eastern Front. Simultaneously, he was transferred to the west, replacing Kluge as commander- in-chief of Army Group B and OB West. The front in Normandy had collapsed after nearly two months of severe fighting, the U.S. Third Army was driving for the Seine, and an Army group was in danger of being annihilated in the Falaise pocket. Model's first order was that Falaise be defended, which did not impress his staff. However, he quickly changed his mind, convincing Hitler to authorize the immediate escape of the German Seventh Army and Panzer Group Eberbach‚Äîsomething that Kluge, with his limited political clout, had not been able to do. He was thus able to rescue a high proportion of the units involved, albeit at the cost of nearly all their armour and heavy materiel. When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, but only if given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions‚Äîan act that has been described as na√Øvet√© by some, and canny bargaining by others. The reinforcements were not forthcoming, and the city's liberation took place on 25 August. Meanwhile, Model fell back to the German border. After the fighting in Normandy, Model established his headquarters at Oosterbeek, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where he set about the massive task of rebuilding Army Group B. On 17 August 1944, Model was appointed to the temporary command of OB West, upon Kluge's recall to Berlin to answer charges that he had involvement with the failed July 20 plot. (Kluge would commit suicide en route.) Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of Army Group B. = Retreat to Germany = Model with Heinz Harmel On 17 September, his lunch was interrupted when the British 1st Airborne Division dropped into the town launching Operation Market Garden, the Allied attempt to capture the bridges on the lower Rhine, Maas and Waal. Model initially thought they were trying to capture him and his staff, but the soon-apparent scale of the assault quickly convinced him otherwise. When he perceived what the Allies' real objective was, he ordered the II SS Panzer Corps into action. The corps, containing the 9th SS Panzer and 10th SS Panzer Divisions refitting after Normandy, had been overlooked by Allied intelligence. Whilst still seriously understrength, it was composed of veterans and was a deadly threat to lightly equipped paratroopers. 9th SS Panzer took on the British at Arnhem, while the 10th moved south to defend the bridge at Nijmegen. Model believed that the situation represented not just a threat, but also an opportunity to counter-attack and possibly clear the Allies out of the Southern Netherlands. Towards this end, he forbade SS General Willi Bittrich and SS Lieutenant General Heinz Harmel, commanding II SS Panzer Corps and 10th SS Panzer respectively, from destroying the Nijmegen bridge. With the exception of this tactical error, Model is considered to have fought an outstanding battle and handed the Allies a sharp defeat. The bridge at Arnhem was held and the 1st Airborne Division destroyed, dashing the Allies' hopes for a foothold over the Rhine before the end of the year. 246th Volksgrenadier Division in Aachen Arnhem restored much of Model's self- confidence, which had been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the H√ºrtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking full advantage of the fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line. The H√ºrtgen Forest cost the U.S. First Army at least 33,000 killed and incapacitated, including both combat and non-combat losses: German casualties were at least 28,000. Aachen eventually fell on 22 October, again at high cost to the U.S. Ninth Army. The Ninth Army's push to the Roer River fared no better, and did not manage to cross the river or wrest control of its dams from the Germans. H√ºrtgen was so costly that it has been called an Allied \\"defeat of the first magnitude\\", the credit for which has been personally assigned to Model's leadership. = Battle of the Bulge = Model speaking with members of the Hitler Youth in October 1944, Germany Following the Wehrmacht's victory at Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided to launch a last-ditch offensive in the West aiming to catch the Anglosphere forces by surprise, with the objective of retaking Antwerp, striking the seam between the British and Americans that leads to political as well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly the political leadership) could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr. Model, Rundstedt and Krebs, November 1944 Model, along with all the other commanders involved, believed this aim was unachievable given the resources available to the Wehrmacht on the West Front at this late point in the war. His first reaction to the plan was caustic in the extreme: \\"This plan hasn't got a damned leg to stand on.\\" At the same time, both he and Rundstedt felt that the purely defensive posture as had been adopted since retirement from Normandy could only delay Germany's defeat, not prevent it. Thus, he prepared Operation Herbstnebel, a less ambitious attack that did not aim to cross the Meuse, but would still, if successful, have inflicted a severe setback on the Western Allied Army groups now bearing down on the Franco-German border. A similar plan had been developed by Rundstedt at OB West, and the two field marshals combined their idea to present a joint \\"small solution\\" to Hitler. Hitler however rejected this compromise, and the \\"big solution\\" of aiming for Antwerp was ordered. For this operation Model had at his disposal Sixth SS Panzer Army, Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army. These armies, with over 2,000 panzers and 2,000 airplanes represented the last strategic reserve of the crumbling Third Reich. Despite his misgivings, Model threw himself into the task with his usual energy, cracking down on any defeatism he might find. When a staff officer complained about shortages, Model snapped: \\"If you need anything, take it from the Americans\\". When Ludwig Heilmann warned Model that his command 5th Parachute Division was only a Class IV outfit, Model, who by now must have been surfeited with complaints on lack of equipment and insufficient training, merely replied that success would be won by the paratroopers' \\"usual audacity.\\" He remained acutely aware of both the operation's significance, and its most likely outcome. When Colonel Friedrich August von der Heydte, ordered to lead a parachute drop as part of the operation, said that the jump had no more than a 10 percent chance of success, he replied: \\"Well, then it is necessary to make the attempt, since the entire offensive has no more than a 10 percent chance of success. It must be done, since this offensive is the last remaining chance to conclude the war favourably.\\" The operation was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly suffered from a lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January. = Defeat at the Ruhr = The failure of Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein marked the end of Model's special relationship with Hitler, who on 21 January 1945 issued an order that all the divisions of Army Group B would thenceforth be personally responsible to him to limit Model's operational freedom of decision. Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position‚Äîgiven the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material‚Äîwas forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an inch of ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre. bridge at Remagen was the beginning of the end for Model. By mid-March Model and Army Group B had been forced back in fighting of attrition with the Americans across the Rhine river into Germany itself after the stunning failure to destroy the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen. On April 1 Army Group B found itself completely surrounded in the Ruhr by the U.S. First and Ninth Armies. Hitler's response was to declare the Ruhr a fortress, from which he commanded that there was to be no surrender or attempt to break out, in an order similar to that which he had issued at Stalingrad. He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure‚Äîthe heart of Germany's industrial power‚Äîbe destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands. Model ignored these instructions. On April 15, after the Allies had split the pocket into two, Major-General Matthew Ridgway commanding the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps called upon Model to surrender rather than throw the lives of the soldiers under his command away in an impossible tactical situation for Army Group B. Model's reply was that he still considered himself bound by his oath to Adolf Hitler and his sense of honour as a German field marshal, and in consequence a formal surrender was out of the question and he ordered Army Group B's dissolution. The oldest and youngest soldiers were discharged from military service and the remaining men were granted leave by order, to surrender or attempt to break out at their discretion. The Fifth Panzer Army had already laid down its arms before this order was given and Model's command communications in the pocket were disintegrating. On 20 April, Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry in Berlin publicly denounced Army Group B as traitors to the Reich, marking the final act between Model and the Nazi regime he had served. = Suicide = Model's grave at the military cemetery near Vossenack Model's decision ended the war for his men, but he had little desire to witness the aftermath of defeat. He said to his staff before dissolving his command: \\"Has everything been done to justify our actions in the light of history? What can there be left for a commander in defeat? In antiquity they took poison\\". His decision to commit suicide was sealed when he learned that the Soviets had indicted him for war crimes, specifically the deaths of 577,000 people in concentration camps in Latvia and the deportation of 175,000 others as slave labor. These acts were committed by the SS and there is no evidence he was aware of them. He shot himself in the head in a forest on 21 April 1945. The site of the event, between Duisburg and the village of Lintorf, is today part of the city of Ratingen. Model was buried by his men where he died. In 1955, his son, Hansgeorg Model had Model's remains recovered from its field grave and organized a reburial in the Soldatenfriedhof Vossenack, a German military cemetery in the H√ºrtgen Forest.  Generalship  = Limitations = Model on the front Unlike Erwin Rommel, another field marshal who preferred to lead from the front, Walter Model was almost universally disliked by those who had to work with him. For example, when he was made commander of the XLI Panzer Corps in 1941, the entire corps staff asked to be transferred. He made a habit of being abusive and foul-mouthed, micromanaging his subordinates, changing plans without consultation, and bypassing the chain of command when it suited him. He was oblivious to the niceties of etiquette, often reprimanding or castigating his officers in public. When he departed Army Group North in March 1944 after being sent to Ukraine, the army group's chief of staff remarked, \\"the 'Swine' is gone\\". It was a reference to Model's nickname among his staffers, that he had earned during his time at XLI Panzer Corps, namely 'Frontline Pig' (Frontschwein). He was considered a thorough and competent leader but known to \\"demand too much, and that too quickly\\", accepting no excuses for failure from either his own men or those who outranked him. His troops were said to have \\"suffered under his too-frequent absences and erratic, inconsistent demands\\", for he frequently lost sight of what was or was not practically possible. Yet his dislike of bureaucracy and his crude speech often made him well liked by many under his command. Model's B√ºffel movement, the retreat on the Hagen line during the Red Army's Orel offensive and the improvisation during the restoration of the front at Army Group Center and in the west must count as examples of extraordinary retreat operations. His command style had worked when he was leading a division or corps, but once promoted to command of an army, it opened him to criticism over whether the advantages gained were enough to offset the loss of efficiency that followed. The statement that he was no strategist can find merit as it was observed that he showed little inclination to contemplate those stretches of the front he did not command and therefore disregarding the strategic field to conduct warfare. But the conditions, by then, did not exist for any general in the Third Reich. = Strengths = Model is regarded as being an excellent defensive commander of the Third Reich, and having an \\"outstanding talent for improvisation\\". At 3rd Panzer Division he was a pioneer in the use of Kampfgruppen, which would soon become standard practice for the Germans. He had a formidable memory and eye for detail, which allowed him to dominate his staff officers, especially those in charge of specialist areas such as artillery, transport and communications. Before the war he was put in charge of analyzing technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus (\\"the army modernization fanatic\\"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him. He had the reputation of a ruthless commander, willing to inflict and take casualties to stabilize his front. The splitting up of units was continually practiced by Model and took place on the regimental and divisional level. The objective was always to give necessary reinforcements to the centres of gravity when no reserves were available. From an operational viewpoint this allowed Model to achieve defensive successes, which would not have been possible otherwise. According to Newton, the sending of theatre or operational reserves into the line where the fighting was toughest was meant to preserve the units Model saw as organically tied to his own command. For example, he was given the elite Gro√üdeutschland Division in September 1942, when his Ninth Army was under heavy attack during Operation Mars. Though he was told that the division was not to be broken up, Model nonetheless split it into battalions and companies, which he used to plug any gaps that appeared. Gro√üdeutschland took nearly 10,000 casualties out of a strength of 18,000 men, and at one point was reportedly close to mutiny; but from Model's viewpoint these losses were acceptable because they meant that Ninth Army's own troops did not have to suffer them. According to Newton, Model reasoned that the elite units would be eventually withdrawn and reformed, an option which may not have been available to his regular army divisions. That said, he did not simply treat these reserve units as disposable. In early 1942, the Der F√ºhrer Regiment of the 2nd SS Division Das Reich was reduced to a handful of men in three weeks of bitter fighting‚Äîbut in that time it also received reinforcements including 88 mm guns, artillery pieces, and StuG III assault guns, and Model himself visited the sector daily, calculating the minimum support that would be needed to hold off the Soviet attacks. Model was aware of the negative effects of the splitting up of units. For example, on 7 October 1944 he forbade the splitting up of regiments into autonomous battalions to be used outside the division. Allied to this were his boundless determination and vigour and stubborn refusal to countenance defeat. He held himself to the same high standard as he held those around him, saying: \\"He who leads troops has no right to think about himself\\". His visits to the front may not have helped operational efficiency, but they energized his men, who consistently held him in much higher regard than did his officers. As commanding general of Ninth Army he was once recorded as personally leading a battalion attack against a Soviet position, pistol in hand. In combat he spared neither himself nor his subordinates. His peers respected his ability and iron will, even though they may have detested his personality. Guderian thought him the best choice to command Army Group Centre during the crisis of Operation Bagration; the Ninth Army's War Diary recorded, after he arrived at army group headquarters in Minsk: \\"The news of Field Marshal Model's arrival is noted with satisfaction and confidence.\\" Model was the master of the type of defense which can be called 'defense limited in time'; in which one defends as long as possible but then retreats to avoid breakthrough and destruction. He was always at the critical points and took away battlegroups or even single battalions from less threatened sectors. With these units holes were plugged at other locations or short counterattacks were executed and so opportunities were created for bigger solutions. Thus, a closed front was guaranteed while the mixing and tearing apart of units was viewed as the smaller evil.  Assessment  = Relationship with Hitler = Before the war, Model had been content to leave politics to the politicians, preferring instead to concentrate on military affairs. Despite this, he became one of the Wehrmacht's field marshals most closely identified with Hitler. Postwar opinions on him have varied. Some historians have called him \\"blindly loyal\\", a \\"convinced Nazi\\" or a \\"zealous disciple\\" of Hitler; others see in Model a coldly calculating opportunist who used the F√ºhrer to his advantage, whether or not he was committed to him or the ideals of Nazism; some regard him as \\"apolitical to a fault\\"*, loyal to Hitler but never sycophantic. The contradictions between his Lutheran upbringing and his later association with the Nazis have similarly been the subject of comment. As one of the few German generals of middle class upbringing, Model's background appealed to Hitler, who distrusted the old Prussian aristocratic order that still dominated the Wehrmacht's officer corps. His defensive tactics were a much better fit to Hitler's instincts never to give ground, than talk of \\"elastic defence\\"‚Äîeven if Model stood fast out of sheer necessity, and not due to fanaticism. His stubbornness, energy and ruthlessness were more qualities that Hitler found admirable, and Model's blunt and direct manner of speaking also made an impression. In a much-noted incident, Model had to deal with an attempt by Adolf Hitler to interfere with his arrangements. A telephone call from Army Group Center's chief of staff on 19 January 1942 informed him that Hitler, having become nervous about the direct Soviet threat against Vyazma, had decided that XLVII Panzer Corps, 2nd SS Division Das Reich and 5th Panzer Division were not to be employed in the imminent counterattack but reserved for other use in the rearguard. Immediately, Model drove back from Rzhev to Vyazma in a raging blizzard and boarded a plane for East Prussia. Bypassing the figure of field marshal G√ºnther von Kluge, his immediate superior, he sought a personal confrontation with Hitler. At first he attempted to lay out his reasons in the best, dispassionate General Staff manner, only to find the F√ºhrer unmoved by logic. Suddenly, glaring at Hitler through his monocle, Model brusquely demanded to know: \\"Mein F√ºhrer, who commands Ninth Army, you or I?\\". Hitler, shocked at the defiance of his newest army commander, tried to find another solution favorable for both, but Model still was not satisfied. \\"Good, Model\\", the exasperated Hitler finally responded. \\"You do it as you please, but it will be your head at risk\\". According to the Hitler's Table Talk recorded that night, the F√ºhrer commented: \\"I distrust officers who have exaggeratedly theoretical minds. I'd like to know what becomes of their theories at the moment of action\\". But when an officer \\"is worthy of command\\", he told Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, \\"he must be given the prerogatives corresponding to his functions\\". Shortly after Model's departure to Rzhev area, Hitler also stated that: \\"Generals must be tough, pitiless men, as crabbed as mastiffs‚Äîgross-grained men, such as I have in the Party\\". Importantly, however, Model never challenged Hitler on political issues: a point that has been identified as the secret to their successful relationship. Helped by his defensive successes, he thus gained Hitler's full trust and confidence; the F√ºhrer called him \\"my best field marshal\\" and (after Operation Bagration) \\"the saviour of the Eastern Front\\". In turn, this granted Model a degree of flexibility available to no other German general. He frequently disputed, ignored or bypassed orders that he felt unsupportable: at Rzhev and Orel he had constructed defensive fortifications in defiance of a ban, and his use of Shield and Sword tactics while at Army Group North proved to be simply a cover for a staged withdrawal. His relationships with his superiors were marked by dissembling, where what he wrote in his reports could bear little resemblance to what was actually happening. = Model and Nazism = Many of Model's fellow officers considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops to have faith in the F√ºhrer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer F√ºhrungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the F√ºhrer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice. Following the July 20 Plot, Model was the first senior commander to reaffirm his loyalty to Hitler, yet he also refused to give up General Hans Speidel, his chief of staff at Army Group B who was implicated in the plot, to the Gestapo. Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and G√ºnther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place. While on the Eastern Front, Model showed no objection to the treatment of civilians by the SS in the areas under his command and oversaw several anti-partisan operations, mostly while commanding the 9th Army. These operations, conducted by Wehrmacht troops as well as SS, were bloody, although not unusual by German Eastern Front standards. In conjunction with the ruthless scorched earth policies he followed during his retreats, they would lead to the Soviet Union's declaring him a war criminal. Despite this, while commanding Army Group Centre, he refused to dispatch troops to put down the Warsaw uprising (a task that was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear- area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis and the army should have nothing to do with it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kƒôpa, through which vital supply lines ran. Model's biographer, the military historian Steven Newton, argues that the best explanation for Model's behaviour is that he was not necessarily a Nazi but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals. The historian Gerhard Weinberg states that Model had benefited from the hastening of the evolution that occurred in the relationship of Hitler to the military following the defeat at Stalingrad. Hitler had always resented his dependence on a professional higher officer corps whom he hoped to replace at the earliest opportunity with men more ideologically attuned to National Socialism. After Stalingrad, Hitler relieved his generals with greater frequency, while pushing up into the higher ranks those \\"whose dedication to extreme National Social views made them more congenial to his way of thinking\\". Weinberg includes Model, alongside Ferdinand Sch√∂rner and Heinz Guderian, in this group. The historian Ben H. Shepherd opines that Model was \\"not the most fanatical Nazi\\". The reasons Hitler favoured him lay with Model's middle-class background and his ruthlessly utilitarian warfare style. Like Newton, Forczyk suspects that postwar testimonies of Model's negative aspects are exaggerated, considering that Model was not very charismatic (although he actually got along well with most of his staff) and already dead; many staff officers wanted to promote commanders who allowed them a more agreeable life-style, instead of dragging them through snow and mud like Model (in one case, when discussing Manstein's replacement by Model, Friedrich von Mellenthin made resentful remarks about Model's personality and abilities, although he had never served on Model's staff). According to Forczyk, Model only cared about politics if this would give him more troops.

He is the designer for his eponymous progressive label, Asher Levine, known for its mad- scientist-meets-luxe aesthetic and pioneering fabrication techniques.  Early life and education  Levine was raised in Port Charlotte, Florida, where he began sewing at the age of 10 and attended Port Charlotte High School. Shortly after he graduated from PCHS in 2006, Levine got on a plane and moved to New York City to attend Pace University where he experimented with design in the underground avant-garde nightlife scene. He graduated from the University in 2010 with a degree in 'Business Management and Entrepreneurship.'  Career  Shortly before graduation, he founded his label and became the go-to designer for many performance artists. He has almost two decades of experience and training in clothing construction. Levine's designs are defined by its fusion of art and fashion, which challenge, if not broaden, peoples' understandings of silhouettes, proportions, and textures. Much inspiration is drawn from the natural world and the socio-political psychology of contemporary art and youth culture. Levine is best known for designing and fabricating custom garments worn by the Black Eyed Peas, Will.i.am, Bruno Mars, Whoopi Goldberg, Scissor Sisters, Sam Sparro, Dangerous Muse, Adam Lambert, Johnny Weir, La Roux, Cazwell, Peaches, Rita Ora, comedian Caroline Reid's aka ‚ÄúPam Ann‚Äù, Jim Steinman, and - Taylor Swift - for her record-breaking Bad Blood Music Video. Swift's video, which debuted at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, attracted over 1 Billion Views on Vevo.com, YouTube, Xbox, Roku, and other Vevo platforms. The designer has also worked with Lady Gaga. on several occasions, including for her \\"Marry the Night music video. Though custom designs have formed the foundation of the label's notoriety, his debut women's and mainline menswear collection have begun to garner attention of its own. Levine's earlier designs were featured in the November 2011 issue of Vogue Italia, photographed by Emma Summerton and styled by legendary stylist, Patti Wilson. His designs have also been featured in major publications such as i-D, Num√©ro, Interview Magazine, L'Uomo Vogue, Vogue and Rolling Stone. For his latest collection, Levine utilized draped boiled wools, molded leather scales and accessories, exotic furs, and laser cut crepe silks that encompass his perspective on fashion. This collection brings his mad scientist meets luxe aesthetic and cutting edge body scanning technology into an intimate setting reminiscent of the original Paris shows of the 1930s. Most of Levine‚Äôs work focuses on made to measure and local manufacturing. Asher Levine is known for incorporating technology within clothing, but this is the first time he enhances the manufacturing process with intelligent optical measurement software. His designs explore the interplay and fusion of textile innovation and technological advancements all to re-envision the human experience, through collaborating with pioneers and their respective fields. Levine's interest in technology was also seen in one of his previous collections, where he transformed ‚Äúfashion into function‚Äù as noted by MTV Style journalist, Chrissy Mahlmeister. The designer partnered with software developer, PhoneHalo to showcase clothing and accessories with embedded microchips that communicate with your smartphone. The microchips possess GPS locating technology enabled through an application that is readily downloadable to any smartphone. Levine further demonstrates his talent for developing ‚Äúscience fashion‚Äù looks (wrote Tyler Malone of PMc Magazine) by creating his own fabrics through intricate construction, molding and sculpting techniques. For instance, he utilizes materials such as silicone, neoprene, and high-performance polyurethane. His collections exhibit various methods of molding and casting to construct various items in the collection. These innovations can be seen in the three- dimensional hounds tooth printed moto-jacket. The raised print was created by enlarging the relief carving of a traditional houndstooth print onto a rubberized material slab to generate yards of silicone fabric. The final result is a reinterpretation and marriage of the classic motorcycle jacket with a new take on the traditional houndstooth print. He demonstrated his talent for combining fashion and technological innovation by collaborating with MakerBot Industries, the leading innovator of 3D printing. The partnership led to the first-ever pair of 3D printed sunglasses for the collection leading to CNN writer Laurie Segall calling it ‚Äúthe hottest accessory on the runway at [New York] Fashion Week‚Äù. Besides ceaselessly creating and pushing the boundaries of modern fashion, Levine has also been a guest lecturer at higher education institutions such as Stanford University, Fashion Institute of Technology, and Pace University. Levine's skill set is not solely limited to his highly conceptual pieces. His implementation of cutting-edge textiles and construction can be seen in his collections staple pieces such as sweatshirts, pants, gloves and even a weekend bag. Levine's methods and aesthetic are far from ordinary, and his point of view is unlike any of his contemporaries. Due to Levine's unique and innovative fabrication processes and stand-out style, he has become a pioneer of avant-garde fashion, and is quickly becoming ‚Äúone of Hollywood‚Äôs favorite emerging designers‚Äù.

Later, he worked as an assistant to Karl August M√∂bius (1825-1908) at the University of Kiel, and following his habilitation, he returned to the University of W√ºrzburg. In 1882-83 he participated on a research expedition to Trinidad and Venezuela (including the Orinoco River region). Later, he served as a lecturer at the Forstakademie in Aschaffenburg, and from 1887 to 1915, was a full professor of zoology at the University of Dorpat. Kennel was an authority on Microlepidoptera, and in particular the family- Tortricidae (tortrix moths).

In the summer, they move to have access to wetlands and aquatic vegetation, and prefer temperatures under . Diet The eastern moose's diet is similar to that of other moose species. It consumes up to a day of terrestrial vegetation, including forbs and shoots from trees such as willow and birch. It also forages for aquatic plants such as lilies and pondweed during the spring and summer. Like other moose species, it lacks upper front teeth but has eight sharp incisors on its lower jaw. Size and weight Eastern moose are the third largest subspecies of moose only behind the western moose and the Alaska moose. Males stand on average at the shoulder and weigh on average . Females stand on average at the shoulder and weigh on average . Eastern moose antlers have an average span of about across. Social structure and reproduction Eastern moose are solitary most of the year, only come into contact to mate or compete for breeding rights. Females without calves are mostly peaceful towards humans. Males use mating calls to attract females or challenge other bulls. At 10‚Äì11 months young are chased off by their mothers to fend for themselves. Hunting Eastern moose are hunted for food and sport during autumn and winter.

Formed in 1998 by Ian Baddley (Matt Downey) on lead vocals and keyboards; David Live on lead vocals and bass guitar; Harry Snow on drums; and Mark Tracks on lead guitar, they released their first single, \\"Pop Song\\", in April 2000. Their debut album, Music's in Trouble, appeared in October 2002. Their second album, The Very Next Of, was issued in September 2004. The Drugs were nominated for Best Comedy Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 for their debut extended play, The Only Way Is Up (September 2000). They received two further nominations in the same category, in 2002 for their single, \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\" and in 2002 for Music's in Trouble. They broke up in 2005, and reunited in 2008 for a national tour before disbanding again in 2009. A documentary about the band, Masking Agents, was released in November 2011.  History  In 2003 the band's single, \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\", was performed on Rove Live with United States TV soap opera, The Bold and the Beautifuls cast member Ronn Moss miming bass guitar. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, the single was nominated for Best Comedy Release. The group's debut album, Music's in Trouble, was released in October 2003 to positive acclaim. It includes the two singles, ten new tracks, two bonus tracks from The Only Way Is Up EP and four filler tracks. A third single, \\"Burger King\\", was released for free online. The album also received a nomination for Best Comedy Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2003. During 2003 the Drugs and Melbourne-based rap metal band, 28 Days, engaged in a \\"feud\\": it started with an \\"internet stoush\\", escalated into \\"a bar brawl\\" with \\"over $4,000 damage to equipment\\", and initiated a police investigation. Baddley had posted a letter on his group's website which criticised 28 Days' lead singer, Jay Dunne, \\"accusing him of being homophobic and using hateful labels on stage at the Big Day Out\\" earlier that year. Dunne and another member of 28 Days appeared at the Drugs gig at the Duke of Windsor Hotel, Windsor, in late February 2003. According to Patrick Donovan of The Age, \\"Witnesses said cigarette butts were thrown at the Sydney satirical/indie rock band while they played, a drink was poured over their computer, an amplifier was damaged and the tyres on their hire car were slashed.\\" Baddley told Paul Cashmere of Undercover News, \\"This attack was poorly thought out and regardless of its success in destroying our show was a cowardly and stupid attack borne of an intellectually impaired 'pack mentality'.\\" In 2004 the Drugs released a track, \\"I Was a Teenage Voter\\", for a various artists' compilation album, Rock Against Howard. Their second album, The Very Next Of, was released in September 2004, which included \\"I Was a Teenage Voter\\", two then-radio-only tracks (\\"Rogue States\\" and \\"Appease Your God\\"), 15 new tracks and 7 filler tracks. This is their last album. In 2005 they played their final concert at the Metro in Sydney. Their back catalogue, except for The Very Next Of and \\"Burger King\\", were re-released in 2006 on iTunes. In 2008 the Drugs reunited for a tour, We're All Going on Osama Holiday, and disbanded in the following year. In 2010 the trailer for a documentary on the group, Masking Agents, was uploaded to YouTube - the film itself was released in the following year.

There are several categories of SPLPs, covering both Indonesian citizens and non-Indonesian citizens. Indonesia also issued a travel document known in English as an Alien Passport (Paspor Orang Asing), a two-year 24-page document which is separate from the SPLP. Issuance At different times, various types of SPLPs have been authorised by Indonesian immigration and travel documents laws and regulations for both Indonesian citizens and non- Indonesian citizens. #Surat Perjalanan Laksana Paspor Untuk Warga Negara Indonesia (\\"Travel Document in Lieu of an Indonesian Citizen Passport\\" or \\"Indonesian SPLP\\"), a multiple-journey document issued to citizens of Indonesia. #Surat Perjalanan Laksana Paspor Dinas (\\"Travel Document in Lieu of an Official Passport\\" or \\"Official SPLP\\"), a single-journey document issued to government officials. Provision is no longer made for this type of SPLP since the 2011 Immigration Act. #Surat Perjalanan Laksana Paspor Untuk Orang Asing (\\"Travel Document in Lieu of an Alien Passport\\" or \\"Alien SPLP\\"), a single- journey document issued to aliens. #Surat Perjalanan Lintas Batas (\\"Cross- Border Travel Document\\" or \\"SPLB\\"), a multiple-journey document issued to Indonesian citizens living in border areas; it is classified as a kind of SPLP since 2011. Indonesian SPLPs are often issued to Indonesians abroad who have not registered their stay abroad with the Indonesian consulate and have lost their original passports. They may also be issued in Indonesia in case stocks of blank Indonesian passports run low. They have sixteen pages and are valid for three years. In 2010, about 10,000 Indonesians staying in Malaysia without valid travel documents applied for SPLPs in order to return to Indonesia for Hari Raya Idul Fitri. The Indonesian Consulate General in Sabah states that their policy is to issue passports only to employed persons or those with guarantors; others receive SPLPs and are encouraged to leave the country to escape Malaysia's crackdowns on immigration violators. Alien SPLPs have sixteen pages and are valid for one year. According to Indonesian missions abroad, alien SPLPs can be issued in two ways. First, they may be issued to foreigners in Indonesia who do not have any valid travel documents in order for them to depart Indonesia, and in this case are valid only for a one-way journey. Second, they may be issued to foreigners outside of Indonesia who do not have any valid travel documents to go to Indonesia, and in this case are valid for both legs of the journey to and from Indonesia. Issuance of an Alien SPLP requires proof that the holder can be readmitted to the country of departure. The Alien SPLP can be issued to individuals or families; the fee will be higher for the latter case. Official SPLPs are issued to government officials to travel outside of Indonesia on official duty but do not qualify for an official passport, as well as to persons who have lost their official passports while outside of Indonesia. Like Alien SPLPs, Official SPLPs are valid only for one journey and a period of one year. Acceptance , only Italy has stated that it officially recognises the Indonesian SPLP (\\"passport- like travel document for Indonesian citizens\\") for visa-issuance purposes; the Benelux countries, Spain, France, Slovenia, and Norway have explicitly indicated that they do not recognise it. Germany and Estonia indicated that they will accept SPLPs (\\"travel document in lieu of a passport\\") for exit purposes only to enable the holder to return to Indonesia. Other European Union countries did not provide the Council of the European Union's Visa Working Party with any information on their acceptance. Relevant laws and regulations =Prior= The 1950 Travel Documents Act in Article 1 authorised the issuance of \\"other travel documents\\" in general, but did not use the specific term SPLP. The 1959 Travel Documents Act specifically enumerated the SPLP in Article 1 as one of five types of travel documents of the Republic of Indonesia, and the only one which was not a passport. It did not distinguish between Indonesian, Alien, or Official SPLPs as did later acts; it simply stated in Article 4 that Indonesian citizens could obtain either regular passports or SPLPs, while aliens dwelling in Indonesia could obtain alien passports or SPLPs if they had no travel document from any other state or could not obtain one in a reasonable time. In both cases the SPLP could be issued for an individual or include the individual's wife and minor children (under 16) as well. There was no provision for Official SPLPs. In the 1992 Immigration Act, the Indonesian SPLP, Alien SPLP, and Official SPLP are enumerated in Article 29 as three of a total of eight kinds of travel documents of the Republic of Indonesia. The issuance of the Alien SPLP was governed by Article 35, while no specific article governed the Indonesian SPLP or Official SPLP. Again, issuance of the Alien SPLP was only mentioned for the case of foreigners in Indonesia, not those outside of Indonesia.. Also available on Indonesian Wikisource. An English translation is available but lacks legal force and is given for informational purposes only: Government travel documents regulations issued in 1994 gave details about each type of SPLP: Indonesian SPLP in Articles 26 to 30, Alien SPLP in Articles 31 to 35, and Official SPLP in Articles 36 to 39. The regulations state that Alien SPLPs may be applied for either within the territory of Indonesia in order to depart from the country, or outside the territory of Indonesia in order to make a journey to Indonesia and then depart. The regulations required applicants for Alien SPLPs to have guarantors (penjamin) in Indonesia. Prior to 1994, the SPLP had been issued in the form of a single-sheet letter, but from 1994 onward, the General Directorate of Immigration indicated in a public guidelines notice that it would be switching to a book-type format like a normal passport, due to forgery concerns. The notice listed some additional grounds for granting of an SPLP: Indonesian SPLPs would be issued to Indonesians living as illegal immigrants in other countries, as well as in the event of depletion of stocks of blank passports, while Alien SPLPs would be issued to former Indonesian citizens who had lost citizenship under Article 17(k) of Act No. 62 of 1958 and wanted to travel to Indonesia in order to regain Indonesian citizenship. Regulations issued by the General Director of Immigration in November 2010 described the Alien SPLP as issued for the purpose of leaving and then returning to Indonesia, or entering once from outside the territory of Indonesia. =Current= The 2011 Immigration Act in Article 24 listed three types of passports (Diplomatic, Official, and Ordinary) and three types of SPLPs (Indonesian, Alien, and Border Pass). It did not mention Alien Passports nor Official SPLPs. Article 27 through 29 discussed SPLPs. Article 27 (like the 1992 Act's Article 35) did not mention the issuance of Alien SPLPs to people outside of Indonesia, and stated that the issuance of Alien SPLPs was restricted to foreigners whose countries lack diplomatic representation in Indonesia. Article 28 continued the practise of granting SPLPs either on an individual or collective basis. Article 29 discussed border passes..

His last few weeks were spent holidaying at Point Lonsdale, a popular resort in Hobson's Bay, in the hope of some respite.

It is a two-year, 24-page document issued to persons permanently resident in Indonesia who cannot obtain travel documents from any other country. It is referred to in English variously as \\"Indonesian Passport for Aliens\\", \\"Indonesian Stateless Person Passport\\", or \\"Indonesian Stateless Travel Document\\". Details The 1950 Travel Documents Act used the term \\"Paspor Orang Asing\\" (POA) and in Article 5 authorised the issuance of POAs to persons dwelling in Indonesia. Article 6 stated that the validity period would only be eight to twelve months and could not be extended, in contrast to ordinary passports which were issued for two years and could be extended twice by that same length of time. The 1959 Travel Documents Act switched to using the term \\"Paspor Untuk Orang Asing\\" (PUOA) but gave similar provisions on issuance, and authorised a longer validity period of eighteen months, again non-renewable. Article 34 of the 1992 Immigration Act restricted the issuance of PUOAs to aliens permanently resident in Indonesia, and clarified that a PUOA loses validity if its holder obtains a travel document from another country.. The English translation lacks legal force and is given for informational purposes only: 1994 Travel Document Regulations explained that the PUOA is equivalent to the international term \\"certificate of identity\\", and that its period of validity may not be extended. The 2011 Immigration Act makes no provision for the PUOA, only for a travel document in lieu of an alien's passport. They were commonly issued to pro-Kuomintang ethnic Chinese residents not born in Indonesia, who were regarded as stateless by the Indonesian government since they were not covered by the People's Republic of China‚ÄìIndonesia Dual Nationality Treaty. Acceptance Immigration New Zealand states that the POA is an acceptable travel document for visa issuance purposes, provided that it is valid for New Zealand and the other countries which the holder will pass through, and has been properly endorsed with an Indonesian re-entry permit valid for at least three months after the expected date of departure from New Zealand. , the Benelux countries, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, and Norway have explicitly indicated that they do not recognise Indonesian alien's travel documents and will not affix visas to them.

The committee initiated development of global performance based standards for project managers, which, as a joint initiative of governments, professional associations, and corporations, provides an opportunity to: #Respond directly to the expressed needs of industry. #Enhance the profile and effectiveness of project management throughout the project management community, both globally and locally. #Increase support for project management as a field of practice and as an emerging profession. #Enhance the value and recognition of the performance based standards approach. Following a Global Steering Committee meeting hosted by Services SETA of South Africa and held in London in August 2002, the first Working Session of the GAPPS (initially called Global Performance Based Standards for Project Management Personnel) was held in Lille, France in February 2003. Attendees at this Working Session represented member organizations including major project professional organizations such as PMI, AIPM, Singapore Society of Project Managers and the Project Management Association of Japan, government standards bodies from Australia and South Africa, academic institutions and industry. Work of the GAPPS is largely produced by globally representative volunteers, in these three-day Working Sessions which are usually held three times a year. Objectives According to the GAPPS website, their objectives are to: > #Facilitate, develop, approve, publish, promote, maintain and review: > ##global project management standards ##usage guidelines for project > management standards, but #NOT consult, advise, express opinion or develop > products based upon standards and guidelines #NOT provide training, > assessment, certifications or qualifications to individuals based upon > standards and guidelines =Approach to Standards= The GAPPS \\"explicitly recognises\\" that there are many different approaches to project management that can achieve satisfactory results and that there are many different ways for project managers to develop their competence. The GAPPS standards for qualifications of Junior Project Manager (known as Global 1, or \\"G1\\") and Senior Project Manager (known as Global 2, or \\"G2\\") are quite generic, though this is intentionally so, as they are written as a complement to project management standards including those of professional associations (e.g. PMBOK¬ÆGuide, IPMA Competence Baseline and associated National Competence Baselines, APMBoK, P2M) as well as other standards such as BS6079 Guide to Project Management. All of these aforementioned documents can be used in association with the GAPPS to provide further detail, knowledge, and understanding of specific applications. =Adoption of Standards= The GAPPS initiative encourages professional associations to consider adopting these standards to support existing standards and qualifications processes by adding and/or strengthening the performance based dimension. GAPPS also allows additions and modifications to be made to suit specific local and regulatory requirements. Standards and qualifications bodies are similarly encouraged to consider adopting the global performance based standards to facilitate transportability and mutual recognition of qualifications. Further, professional associations that do not have their own standards or qualifications are encouraged to adopt the standards and several associations have already begun this process. Public and private organizations are encouraged to adopt the global standards as a basis for internal development and accreditation systems that will facilitate consistency across their global operations. This also applies to organizations that only operate locally but who are required to operate, source, and assess their project management personnel in an increasingly global marketplace, where assurance of the global relevance of qualifications is of value. Products Since inception, the GAPPS has produced the following standards, research, and documents: *Standards **Project Manager Standards **CIFTER Table for Evaluating PM Roles **Standards for Global 1 (Junior PM) and Global 2 (Senior PM) **Review commenced (to include Global Project Manager) *Program Manager Standards **Six categories of Program Manager **ACDC Table for Program Manager Role Definition *Mapping of Standards including **Australian Institute of Project Management Standards (AIPM) **Australian National Competency Standards for Project Management (ANCSPM) **International Project Management Association's (IPMA) Competence Baseline V3.0 (ICB¬Æ) **P2M **Project Management Institute's (PMI) PMBoK¬ÆGuide 2008 **PRINCE2 2009 **SAQA National Qualifications Level 5 Standard In addition to the development of performance based standards (which can be used to complement existing knowledge based standards or in their own right) the GAPPS provides additional guidelines for their use in assessment and offers an Endorsed Provider program that provides assurance of equivalency between assessments.

Fictional counties, cities and towns are arrows in the fiction writers' quivers they lend an air of authenticity to the story, and since there are so many of them, readers find them to be a plausible addition that makes the story more realistic. Credible, well fleshed out, and named locales are integral to fictional world building. William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County uses a convincing set of facts and details, and is a prototypical development of a place and time in a work of fiction. Faulkner often referred to Yoknapatawpha County as \\"my apocryphal county.\\" Fictional county maps are part of the creative process (orienting both the writer and the reader to geography and relationships), and are part of selling the story. They sometimes combine existing cartographic information to present an imaginary location, or combine existing cartographic information to show a different perspective of a location. Absalom, Absalom! includes a map of Yoknapatawpha County drawn by Faulkner.

Life He was the son of John Theyer (d. 1631), and grandson of Thomas Theyer of Brockworth, Gloucestershire, and was born there in 1597. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, when about sixteen, but did not graduate. After three years at Magdalen he practised common law at New Inn. Anthony Wood's mother proposed to send her son to qualify under Theyer as an attorney. Wood did not go, but he became a lifelong friend, and visited Theyer to make use of his library. It was at Cooper's Hill, Brockworth, a small estate given Theyer by his father on his marriage in 1628. Theyer resided mainly at Brockworth. At the start of the First English War in 1642, he intervened at Painswick church, where some iconoclastic Parliamentarians had been active; his wife claimed descent from the courtier William Kingston who had an elaborate tomb in the church. Theyer made a court appearance in September with two local men, was fined, and added some church brasses to his collection in 1644;Welbore St. Clair Baddeley, A Cotteswold Manor; being the history of Painswick (1907), pp. 201‚Äì2; archive.org.Welbore St. Clair Baddeley, History of the Church of St. Mary at Painswick (1902), p. 36; archive.org. the tomb inscription to Kingston was later reported lost.Cecil Tudor Davis, The Monumental Brasses of Gloucestershire (1899) p. 217; archive.org. In 1643 Theyer was in Oxford, serving in the king's army. Wood says he became a Roman Catholic about this time. His estate was sequestrated by the parliament, who pronounced him one of the most 'inveterate' with whom they had to deal. His family were almost destitute until his discharge was obtained on 4 November 1652. Theyer died at Cooper's Hill on 25 August 1673, and was buried in Brockworth churchyard on the 28th. Works Theyer presented to Charles I, in Merton College garden, a copy of his Aerio Mastix, or a Vindication of the Apostolicall and generally received Government of the Church of Christ by Bishops, Oxford, 1643.Full title given as Aerio-mastix, or, A vindication of the apostolicall and generally received government of the Church of Christ by bishops against the schismaticall A√®erians of our time wherein is evidently demonstrated that bishops are jure divino : 1 as they are superintendents of the inferiour clergy, 2 as without whom there can be no lawfull ordination, 3 as through whom lawfull succession is deduced by scriptures, fathers, councells : with answers to the principall objections against episcopacy : digested into and exact method; catalogue entry . It was a controversial work, a contribution to the debate on episcopacy arising from Smectymnuus;Peter Heylyn, Cyprianus anglius: or the History of the Life and Death of the most Reverend and renowned Prelate William Archbishop of Canterbury (1668), p. 496; Google Books. the title references Aerius of Sebaste, who in the view of some of Theyer's contemporaries was the first Presbyterian.Henry Kaye Bonney, The Life of the Right Reverend Father in God, Jeremy Taylor (1815), p. 21 note b; Google Books. On 6 July 1643 he was created M.A. on merit, by the king's command. He began, but did not live to finish, A Friendly Debate between Protestants and Papists. Family By his wife Susan, Theyer had a son John; the latter's son Charles (b. 1651) matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 7 May 1668, and was probably the lecturer of Totteridge, Hertfordshire, who published A Sermon on her Majesty's Happy Anniversary, London, 1707. Theyer Library Richard Hart, the last prior of Llanthony Secunda, Gloucestershire, was lord of the manor of Brockworth, and the builder of Brockworth Court; he was also the brother of Theyer's grandmother Ann Hart. Theyer inherited Hart's library of manuscripts, which determined his direction as collector. He collected manuscripts from the West Midlands, in particular;Louise Sylvester, Lexis and Texts in Early English: studies presented to Jane Roberts (2001), p. 53; Google Books. he made acquisitions from Worcester and West of England religious houses,Julius Parnell Gilson, The Library of Henry Savile, of Banke, in Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, London vol. 9 (October 1906 ‚Äì March 1908), p. 136; archive.org. including Buckfast Abbey and Hailes Abbey.Monastic Database page Brockworth Court, Gloucestershire, today. To his grandson Charles, Theyer bequeathed 800 manuscripts.They were catalogued in Harl. MS. 460. Charles Theyer then offered them to Oxford University, and the Bodleian Library despatched Edward Bernard to see them, but no purchase was made, and they passed into the hands of Robert Scott, a bookseller of London. A catalogue of 336 volumes, dated 29 July 1678, was prepared by William Beveridge and William Jane.Royal MS. Appendix, 70. The Collection. The Theyer collection was bought by Charles II, after Beveridge and Jane had beaten Scott down to half the asking price on some key items.Edward Edwards, Libraries and Founders of Libraries (1864, 2010 reprint), p. 172; Google Books. This 1678 accession to the Library was handled by Henry Thynne;Paul Ayris, David Selwyn, Thomas Cranmer: churchman and scholar (1999), p. 52; Google Books. it is considered the major addition to the collection of this period, excepting only the Codex Alexandrinus. The 1697 Catalogus Manuscriptorum Angli√¶ by Bernard does not mention the location as the Royal Library, an anomaly for which Richard Bentley was responsible as librarian.J. M. Stone, Studies from Court and Cloister (2004), p. 244; Google Books. It gives 312 items. The whole collection passed with the Old Royal Library to the British Museum (see Royal manuscripts, British Library). Montague Rhodes James researched the bequest to Charles Theyer. It led him to trace the passage of manuscripts at Llanthony to the library at Lambeth Palace.Montague Rhodes James, The Manuscripts in the Library at Lambeth Palace (1900); archive.org. =Particular items= Page from a 15th-century manuscript owned by John Theyer.British Library Catalogue. It is from The Vision of William of Stranton (also William Staunton), a religious work relating to St Patrick's Purgatory. Theyer's library included works of Roger Bacon, and manuscripts of Thomas Cranmer once thought lost. Humphrey Wanley claimed that Cranmer's Commonplace Book was acquired by Henry Compton, and only later was added to the larger collection of the Old Royal Library.Ayris and Selwyn, p. 313; Google Books.

It was written by Laurence Coriat and directed by Welsh director Marc Evans and stars Minnie Driver, Aneurin Barnard, Kimberley Nixon and Robert Pugh. It premi√®red at the 55th BFI London Film Festival on 25 October 2011, and was officially released on 2 March 2012 in the UK. Plot Set in a Welsh comprehensive school during the long hot summer of 1976, keen drama teacher Vivienne (Minnie Driver) fights sweltering heat and general teenage apathy to put on a glam rock musical version of Shakespeare's The Tempest of which David Bowie (whose album provides the name of the film) might be proud. To engage her totally lackadaisical students, and get them to explore and express their emotions, she uses pop hits of the time, performed by a fresh young cast led by Davey (Aneurin Barnard). She hopes her more liberal approach to learning may stir them to discover they might be good at something, if once they let their inhibitions go, and might actually have fun creating something, and even absorb some of the dreaded Shakespeare after all. Her aspirations appear thwarted by her troublesome students who, raging with hormones, get up to various antics which seem destined to sabotage the musical. She also faces opposition from traditionally-minded, old-fashioned teaching staff, so getting the show to opening night is a constant challenge. Later, a frustrated student sets fire to the whole school auditorium. Consequently, now minus a stage and most of the musical instruments, the show has to be promptly cancelled by the headmaster, despite his cooperation having earlier been bribed by his being cast in the part of Prospero). A side plot involves conflict between Vivienne's liberalism and the attitudes of her long-standing opponents on the staff, centring on discovering which \\"delinquent\\" student was responsible for the arson. Deflated, but ultimately unwilling to chart this mishap or her role as \\"music teacher\\" as yet another thing she's failed at in life, she manages to persuade both the headmaster and the students to continue with rehearsals, and go ahead with the show regardless, but re-siting it in an alfresco outdoor setting. So The Tempest is staged under moon and stars, set around a large theatrical looking tree on the school grounds. Her production is a triumph, much enjoyed by both the students and their families in the audience. An end scene, just prior to the credits rolling, features a photo-montage of what became of each student post leaving school. Vivienne had remained as music teacher, directing a school play every year since, till, at the year of release of 'this very film', she retires from the job.

Plot introduction  The fictional hero of the book, David Small, is the unconventional leader of the Conservative Jewish congregation in the fictional suburban Massachusetts town of Barnard's Crossing. As the protagonist of a series of novels, Rabbi Small has wisdom, an unerring sense of Jewish tradition (which can at times put him at odds with the Jewish community when he believes that they are seriously deviating from Judaism) and all the good qualities of a detective sharpened by his Talmudic training, which enables him to see the third side of a problem. He is a devoted husband to his wife and (later in the series) father to his two children Jonathan and Hepsibah. Small's logic, learned from the Talmud, plays an important part in the plots. Usually Small is drawn into the events when they involve a member of his congregation or Barnard's Crossing's Jewish community in general. Among other characters is Hugh Lanigan, the Catholic local police chief, and the two friends often discuss religion over a cup of tea. He has many troubles with his congregation and he is constantly at odds with at least one of its powerful members, usually the Temple President at the time. Plot summary Marcus Aptaker, owner of the long-established pharmacy Town-Line Drugs, is in dispute with the Temple Board. The land which his business leases has been willed to the Temple by the late Mr Goralsky. The Board propose to sell it to a big-time real estate operator with other plans. His wife appeals to Rabbi Small, who can do nothing but is concerned that the Temple may be in breach of Halacha. He also opposes their plan to buy a country retreat with the proceeds and employ a rabbi he does not know. Arnold, Aptaker's estranged son, also a pharmacist, returns home. He has been involved with an ultra-religious group and has adopted the name of Akiva Rokeach, but he and his father clash and he leaves angrily. An elderly man, Jacob Kestler, dies, ostensibly from a drug-related reaction and suspicion falls on the pharmacy - in particular on Arnold who had been working there. He is arrested by Lanigan, but Rabbi Small is not convinced of Arnold's guilt and proceeds to pinpoint the real culprit. The land deal does not go ahead and Rabbi Small, who had threatened to resign, remains with the Temple. Arnold remains in Barnard's Crossing and becomes engaged to Leah Kaplan, daughter of Temple President, Chester Kaplan  Characters  * David Small ‚Äì the Rabbi of the title, protagonist * Hugh Lanigan ‚Äì the local police chief * Miriam Small ‚Äì the Rabbi's wife * Marcus Aptaker ‚Äì pharmacist * Arnold Aptaker/Akiva Rokeach ‚Äì son of Marcus * Chester Kaplan ‚Äì Temple President * Leah Kaplan ‚Äì daughter of Chester  References  Category:1976 American novels Category:American mystery novels Category:Edgar Award-winning works Category:Novels set in Massachusetts Category:Novels about rabbis ","title":"Wednesday the Rabbi Got Wet"},{"id":"33743599","text":"Henry Dudley Maxwell (1932 ‚Äì 23 August 2013) was a New Zealand rugby league footballer who represented New Zealand in the 1957 and 1960 World Cups.

The central character, Luke Benning (Nick Stahl), is a journalist investigating the possible mutilation (by Canadian snipers) of corpses in Afghanistan, a country that appears increasingly incomprehensible and surreal as Luke undergoes a series of bizarre adventures. Plot Disheartened when his story about Canadian snipers possibly mutilating corpses in Afghanistan is buried, Luke (Nick Stahl) quits his job but is even more determined to return to Afghanistan to get the real story. With his offbeat buddy, Tom (Nicolas Wright), tagging along, Luke returns to Afghanistan and intends to gather enough evidence to get his old story into print. But he soon finds that the country is an even more dangerous place than when he left. To make matters worse, his old friend and fixer, Mateen (Stephen Lobo) has been hired away by Luke's journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar (Vik Sahay). Soon the trip for Luke and Tom in Afghanistan turns into a surreal and perilous adventure, a journey into an alternate reality, filtered through a haze of gun smoke. They encounter Taliban raids, bombings and unfinished business with an Afghanistan businessman. Luke still makes his way through the wilderness with Canadian troops and Arabian guides to find out if his story is true or not. In the end, he realises that the rumour about Canadians mutilating fingers is a lie and that his people still have some morality in this war torn land. Just as he is about to leave, He and Sgt. Rick (a Canadian soldier who is the leader of the squad with whom he had been travelling) come under fire from a Taliban sniper, but the Taliban runs out of bullets and walks off, while Luke thinks he killed him. While they move back to the base, Luke runs into Matteen, where he finds out that they really do share a friendship. The last scene is where Luke decides to go home.

S. Vasan of Gemini Studios. Plot summary Jeevudu, an untouchable cobbler, leads a saintly life with his wife Seva and son Bhavudu. Because of his devotion, Lord Vishnu appears before him every day, and eats whatever he is given as a prasad offering. Santha, the daughter of the proud and powerful Rajaguru, learning of this, visits his hut to discover whether it is true. When she witnesses it for herself, she informs her father of this wonder. Angry that his daughter has visited the house of an untouchable, he locks her up. He then informs Jeevudu that the king's mother was performing a cheppula nomu (Chappal vrata) and needs a thousand sandals by next morning. Jeevudu and his family work all night, but can only make a few sandals. They fall asleep from exhaustion; when they awaken the next morning, they find the house full of sandals. Rajaguru lies to the king, persuading him to order Jeevudu to be imprisoned and to have his hands cut off and his eyes put out; Bhavudu is stoned. With the help of a flower girl, Santha escapes from the chamber where her father has confined her. She tells Seva what has happened to her husband and her son. When Seva goes to the jail and sees her blinded husband, she puts her own eyes out. At this point, Lord Vishnu and his consort Sridevi appear in the form of tribals. They restore their devotees; Rajaguru realizes the error of his ways; and all ends happily. Cast Cast adapted from the song book * P.

The Kaijende Highlands include Lake Tawa, Paiela Road, Omyaka Creek, Waile Creek and the Porgera Reservoir. The mountain range is 70 km north-west of Mount Hagen.BirdLife International (2010). According to a survey conducted in 2007, \\"areas like Kaijende are characterized by pronounced dominance of microtherm families, most notably by Cunoniaceae, Epacridaceae, Ericaceae, Geraniaceae, Myrsinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Theaceae, Violaceae, and Winteraceae.\\" The Kaijende Highlands have received media attention since 2005 due to a number of new species discovered in the area. A notable study compiled samples of 759 specimens from the Kaijende Highlands, which is among the largest surveys by CI-RAP in Papua New Guinea, and discovered 24 new species of plants and frogs among them. Other surveys have found new species of jumping spiders and other fauna.  Biodiversity surveys  The Kaijende Highlands have received media attention between 2005 and 2010 due to a number of biodiversity studies which have discovered a plethora of new species of plants and animals. In August to September 2005, Conservation International and the Porgera Joint Venture, performed a biodiversity survey to \\"collect data on the species richness and conservation status of plants, herpetofauna, birds and mammals.\\" According to the report published by Conservation International in 2007, \\"the flora and fauna of Enga Province are probably less well known than that of any other province in Papua New Guinea\\". The Porgera Joint Venture also participated in the development of a Wildlife Conservation Area in the Kaijende Highlands. Another study, performed by Wayne Takeuchi of the Forest Research Institute compiled samples of 759 specimens from the Kaijende Highlands, which is among the largest surveys by CI-RAP in Papua New Guinea. The survey discovered 24 new species, including 16 new plants (5 arborescent taxa, 5 understory shrubs, 2 vines, 2 orchids, and 2 ferns), and 8 new species of frogs.

Most of the polluted silt was deposited in the Ketelmeer by the IJssel river between 1950 and 1990. Removal of silt soil from the Ketelmeer lake also aims to deepen the channel leading to the mouth of the IJssel to at least a depth of , thus aiming to improve access to the river for navigation. Construction of IJsseloog started in 1996 and was completed in 1999. During construction of the IJsseloog, a major concern was to preserve the water table and the environment of Ketelmeer. The polluted silt is to be stored permanently and without any risk of leakage. To avoid nuisance to agriculture, to local residents, and to prevent groundwater contamination, the silt depository was built in the centre of the lake and not on the coast. IJsseloog is also a target for recreational and ecological development. Two other artificial islands were created: Hanzeplaat and Schokkerbank. The dredgings are being stored in a man-made island depot in the middle of the Ketelmeer. One kilometer across and fifty meters deep, the depot is designed to hold 23 million cubic meters of sludge, of which 15 million cubic metres from the Ketelmeer, and the rest from elsewhere.. To prevent leakage, the floor of the depot is sealed with clay and the dike is lined with foil. The water level is held below that of the lake, to prevent pollution runoff. A port was built on the outer edge of the IJsseloog for delivery of silt. Once the depot is full, remediation will be done by decantation. Clean silt will be used to construct a new ecological zone, the IJsselmonding. The clean sludge that is released will be used for the construction of a natural IJssel estuary. A treatment plant began operating in 2000. Its processing station separates sand and peat from contaminants. Purified sand will be used for construction, and the remaining sludge is pumped to storage. When storage is full, the layers of clay and sand will be sealed, and the island itself will be used for recreational purposes. After that process, Nature will take over in the IJsseloog.

Broinowski was born in Carlton to ornithologist and artist Gracius Joseph Broinowski and Jane, n√©e Smith. The family moved to Sydney in 1880, where Leopold attended St Ignatius' College, Riverview. He began an arts degree at the University of Sydney in 1889. Broinoswski graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1897, after spending time as a teacher at Newington College and helping on his father's Campbelltown farm. A strong proponent of Federation, he abandoned his law degree in 1898, to become Edmund Barton's secretary during the Federation referenda. He subsequently became a journalist, writing for the Goulburn Evening Penny Post before moving to Hobart to work for the Mercury, of which he became associate editor in 1904. In 1908 he married Annie Coverdale Sorell, with whom he had two children. Broinowski contested the Australian House of Representatives at the 1922 federal election, running unsuccessfully as one of three endorsed Nationalists in Denison. His early support for federation was tempered by a strong states' rights campaign; his slogan was \\"Tasmania First\\". Following his defeat he became a returned servicemen's advocate; given the Certificate of Merit by the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, he edited Tasmania's War Record 1914-18\\\\. As a political reporter he had a sizeable impact on Tasmanian politics and was generally respected across the political spectrum despite his clear conservative leanings. He died from cerebrovascular disease in Hobart in 1937.

In Glenn Springs, the raiders burned several buildings and fought a three-hour battle with a small force of American soldiers who were stationed there. At the same time, a second party of rebels robbed a general store and a silver mine in Boquillas. Four Americans were killed and the rebels took two hostages to Coahuila. In response to the attack, the United States Army launched a short punitive expedition into Mexico, fought with the rebels, and rescued the captives. Background Following the Mexican federal victory at the Battle of Celaya in April 1915, Mexican rebel Pancho Villa led the remnants of his once large army back to northern Mexico. By 1916, Villa and his men were in desperate need of food and provisions to continue their revolution, so they devised a plan to raid the American border town of Columbus, New Mexico. On the early morning of March 9, 1916, approximately 500 mounted Villistas attacked and burned the town, though not long after that they were encountered by some 300 American troops. After a pitched battle, the Villistas were defeated and pursued back into Mexico, having lost nearly 200 killed, wounded, or captured. Eighteen Americans died in the engagement, including ten civilians and eight soldiers, an outrage that incited President Woodrow Wilson to authorize a punitive expedition into Mexico to capture or kill Villa. The Pancho Villa Expedition, as it became known, was under the command of Gen. John J. Pershing and it lasted from March 14, 1916, to February 7, 1917. Starting from various camps and forts along the border, Pershing headed into Chihuahua where his men engaged the Villistas on multiple occasions. Pershing was able to capture or kill several rebel commanders but Pancho Villa got away, and his rebels continued to launch raids on U.S. territory while American troops were in Mexico. Tension along the international border between Texas and Mexico was high during the Mexican Revolution. Raids into southern Texas were very common, so to help protect the Big Bend region, President Wilson allowed troops to occupy the area in June 1915. Boquillas and Glenn Springs were just small settlements at the time, about 12 miles apart, and only nine soldiers from the 14th Cavalry guarded at the former and none at the latter. Glenn Springs was located just south of Chilicotal Mountain and centered around a small spring named after the first settler in the area who was killed at the site by Comanches. The town was home to some 80 people, who were employed mainly by a candelilla wax factory, owned by \\"Captain\\" C.D. Wood and W.K. Ellis. The Ellis family also owned the general store, which was managed by C.G. Compton and his family. The inhabitants, who were mostly Mexican-Americans, lived in a \\"scattered\\" neighborhood of about 50 jacales concentrated at one end of town. Boquillas was even smaller than Glenn Springs. Located along the Rio Grande, across from the mining town of Del Carmen, Boquillas had a general store, owned by Jesse Deemer, and several jacales.http://www.nps.gov/bibe/historyculture/upload/Glennspring_SB.pdf Raid On May 5, 1916, just 57 days after the Battle of Columbus, Lt. Col. Natividad Alvarez launched his attack with about 60 to 200 men (accounts of the rebels' strength differ but there was likely no more than 80 involved). Though Col. Alvarez was a follower of Pancho Villa, on the march from Torre√≥n to Texas he recruited both Carrancistas and fellow Villistas. Alvarez divided his command into two prongs; he led the first against Boquillas while at the same time Rodriguez Ramirez led the second against Glenn Springs. Because it was Cinco de Mayo, the Mexicans living in Glenn Springs were holding a celebration for themselves and the people in the area. Since many people had come to town that day, Alvarez and his men looked like regular citizens, visiting friends and family, and had no trouble occupying the Mexican neighborhood without alerting the soldiers' suspicions. The conflict began sometime after 11:00 P.M., by which time everyone in town had gone to sleep, except the rebels who started the raid by arming themselves and approaching the home of Compton and his three children. One of the rebels knocked on the door and asked if there were any soldiers in town, to which Compton said there wasn't. The rebels left, allowing Compton time to take his daughter to the nearby home of an old Mexican lady, where she would be safe. Compton left his two young sons at home by themselves and while he was going back to his house he heard the raiders begin shooting and calling out \\"Viva Villa\\" and \\"Viva Carranza.\\" Compton apparently hid at that point and by the time he had got back to his home he found that his four-year-old son had been murdered but his ten-year-old boy was left unharmed, likely because he was a deaf-mute. Meanwhile, the nine-man cavalry squad, under Sergeant Charles E. Smyth, had abandoned their tents and taken up positions in an old adobe building. The skirmish that followed lasted for nearly three hours but eventually the rebels came up with a cunning idea to set fire to the roof, which was thatched with candelilla leaves. This forced the cavalrymen leave the structure and try to retreat to their horses, and it was during this time that three of the soldiers were killed and at least four others were either wounded or severely burned. The soldiers who were killed were * William Cohen * Stephen J. Coloe * Lawrence K. Rogers One civilian, a son of C.G. Compton, was also killed.Investigation of Mexican Affairs, p. 858. The surviving soldiers escaped and hid in the desert outside of town. Mr. and Mrs. Ellis watched the attack from a canyon behind their house. They hid there for some time until deciding to walk to the ranch of James Rice, 12 miles away. Capt. Wood was at his ranch three miles from town when he heard the shooting. At first he thought it was celebrating but as the firing continued he decided to mount his horse and ride to town with his friend, Oscar de Montel. It took over two hours before Wood and de Montel made it to town. They arrived just before the cavalrymen retreated, and entered unnoticed. Wood and de Montel then dismounted and began walking to the general store, which was on fire, but 50 yards away they heard the sound of horses eating corn and men speaking Spanish. When de Montel climbed a hill to have a better look someone saw him and called out Qui√©n vive? De Montel responded with Qui√©n es? and then the shooting started. The two men then began running as fast as they could but they hit a wire fence and fell to the ground. A bullet splintered a rock near where Wood had fallen and some of it hit him in the hand, causing a slight wound. Once out of town the two were able to elude their pursuers and make contact with the surviving cavalrymen. According to author Benjamin R. Beede, the rebels encountered no resistance at Boquillas and they successfully looted the town. Lt. Col. Alvarez was somehow captured by the townspeople, although the raiders took two hostages before heading to the Del Carmen mines to steal the company payroll. The hostages were Jesse Deemer and his black Seminole assistant Monroe Payne, a relative of the Indian scouts Adam and Isaac Payne. According to Beede's account, more hostages were taken at the mines but all of them were apparently released before the rebels rode back to Mexico. After the attack on Glenn Springs, Ramirez regrouped with Alvarez's men in Boquillas and they crossed the Rio Grande into the state of Coahuila. The hostages were held in a stolen truck and driven to Mexico. Deemer pretended he was a German while in captivity; this was because of an order issued by Pancho Villa, who viewed Germans as friendlies. When the raid was over, the commercial buildings and some of the houses in Glenn Springs were heavily damaged but Boquillas was left comparatively untouched. At Glenn Springs, the wax factory, the Ellis' store and the adobe building the American soldiers defended were all burned and several houses were looted. The rebels also stole all of Mrs. Ellis' clothing and a day later some of the thieves were seen wearing the clothes near San Vicente, Texas. In all, four Americans had been killed, two captured and at least five wounded or burned. Though successful, at least one Mexican rebel was killed and a few were wounded. Capt. Wood said that on May 6 he found the body of one raider and \\"seven pools of blood,\\" indicating that some others may have been either killed or wounded. The army later established a camp at Glenn Springs, which it maintained until 1920, when the settlement became a ghost town. Aftermath When Gen. Hugh L. Scott learned of the attack he organized another punitive expedition under the joint command of Col. Frederick W. Sibley and Maj. George T. Langhorne. Setting out from Marathon on May 8, the expedition assembled at Jesse Deemer's store in Boquillas, where Col. Sibley allowed Maj. Langhorne to proceed ahead of the main column with two troops of the 8th Cavalry; the remainder of the expedition would then follow in two days. With 80 men, two wagons and one Cadillac touring car, Langhorne crossed the Rio Grande on May 11 and headed for the village of El Pino, Coahuila, where the rebels were holding Deemer and Monroe Payne. Following a 24-hour march, Langhorne arrived at El Pino and learned that the rebels wanted to trade Lt. Col. Alvarez for Deemer and Payne. Langhorne had no intention of negotiating so he put \\"12 sharpshooters\\" into the touring car and ordered them to attack the little village. However, when they began their advance, the rebels fled, leaving Deemer and Payne in American hands. Though the two hostages had been liberated, the Americans continued to search for the raiders and, on May 15, a small force of cavalrymen, under the command of Lt. Stuart W. Cramer, engaged in a \\"brief firefight\\" at Castillon. Five Mexicans were killed during the skirmish and two more were wounded; there were no casualties on the American side. The expedition occurred while the U.S. and the Mexican government of Venustiano Carranza were holding a peace conference in El Paso. During the conference, Carranza issued a statement saying that Sibley's and Langhorne's \\"little punitive expedition\\" was pushing Mexico and the U.S. into war. Carranza had already protested about Gen. Pershing's expedition in Chihuahua, so it was agreed that Sibley and Langhorne would return to the U.S., which they did, on May 25, after a 550-mile journey.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode centers on Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) coming to the aid of a young pregnant woman named Ashley Boyd (Jessy Schram) who is trying to escape from Storybrooke and Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle), which parallels with Cinderella's (Schram) regrettable deal she made with Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle). The episode was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman, while being directed by David Solomon. Goodman used the newly introduced character of Cinderella to reveal more of Emma's backstory, as she had no flashbacks to draw upon. Schram's casting was confirmed in August 2011, when it was revealed that Cinderella's storyline would differ from the traditional fairytale. Goodman wrote the character as a naive though sweet woman who makes bad decisions that places her in even more \\"unfortunate circumstances.\\" Series regular Raphael Sbarge does not appear in the episode. \\"The Price of Gold\\" first aired in the United States on ABC on November 13, 2011.

Plot =Opening sequence= Cinderella's Fairy Godmother is shown flittering in the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, Cinderella (\\"Ella\\") is about to receive a wish from her fairy godmother, but the godmother is killed first by Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and robbed of her wand. He grants Ella (Jessy Schram) her wish to escape her home, but in return requires her to sign a contract. Rumpelstiltskin transforms Ella into an elegant woman complete with glass slippers, warning her that all magic has a price. Several months later, at a gala wedding ball for Ella and her new husband, Prince Thomas (Tim Phillipps), Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) congratulate the couple on their wedding, as does Rumpelstiltskin who tells Ella that he does not care for her riches or baubles, but instead shall claim her firstborn child. Ella tells Thomas about the deal with Rumpelstiltskin. Seeking to avoid fulfilling this deal, Thomas, Charming, Grumpy, and The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) come up with a plot to capture Rumpelstiltskin by luring him into signing another contract. Hours later, Ella and Rumpelstiltskin meet to sign the deal. Ella lies to him and says she is expecting twins and will give him both of the babies in exchange for improving the crops and wealth of the kingdom. A skeptical Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but as he signs the contract, he is rendered powerless due to a special red quill pen, that was created by The Blue Fairy. He is captured, but Thomas disappears soon after. Ella demands that Rumpelstiltskin tell her what has happened, but he claims not to have done anything. He reminds her that all magic has a price, and says that she will not see Thomas again until her debt is paid. =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) gives Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) an offer to become his deputy. Later, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Emma that she is no longer afraid of her staying in the town, and cites Emma's mobile lifestyle. Emma encounters a 19-year-old pregnant maid named Ashley Boyd (Schram), crying about not having a future for both her and her baby. Emma tells Ashley that she knows how it feels to have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life. Later that evening, Ashley breaks into Mr. Gold's pawn shop and steals a contract from a safe. While there, she is confronted by Mr. Gold, who attempts to stop her. Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the floor of his shop. The next day, Henry goes to Emma's home to spend time with her, despite being forbidden to do so by Regina, who has gone to a \\"council meeting\\" for the day. Mr. Gold asks Emma to track down Ashley. He claims that she has something that belongs to him and that Ashley is unstable and troubled. Emma reluctantly agrees, and learns from Ruby (Meghan Ory) that she should stop by the home of her ex- boyfriend Sean (Phillipps). Emma goes there and speaks to Sean and his father, finding out that it is the latter that has told him not to get involved with the pregnant teenager. Emma discovers that Ruby has given her car to Ashley so that she can leave Storybrooke and head to Boston. Emma and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) find the vehicle has crashed just short of the city's limits, with Ashley about to deliver the baby. Back at the hospital, Ashley gives birth to a girl, just in time for Mr. Gold to pick up his \\"merchandise\\". Emma tells Mr. Gold that even if he was to take the child away, he could face legal troubles that could cost him dearly. Mr. Gold then offers a deal for Emma in which he'll give up his questionable claim to the child and in return, Emma will owe him a favor. Emma agrees. After she leaves, Sean shows up to see his child, and they name the girl Alexandra. Later, Emma, over the phone, agrees to Graham's offer to become his deputy. After hanging up, the sheriff picks up his socks under the bed, revealing that Regina's \\"council meetings\\" has actually been a cover for sexual encounters with him. Production The episode was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman, while being directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer veteran David Solomon. Goodman used Cinderella's storyline to produce more character development for Emma, a character with no flashbacks to draw upon. Morrison stated that Ashley/Cinderella \\"is definitely a character Emma relates to.\\" Executive producer Steve Pearlman developed the series to have standalone episodes that still encouraged viewers to watch each week. In an interview, he used \\"The Price of Gold\\" as an example of this, as the episode \\"introduce[s] Cinderella in the first act and we resolve the story in the final act. [But then there's an] Emma portion of that story that kind of continues.\\" Pearlman added that \\"there are other twists and turns along the way that don't have anything to do with the specifics of the Cinderella story that are additive to our character development. Hopefully, what we're doing over the course of the season is continuing to build each week, give the audience something new about our main characters that keeps them coming back.\\" In August 2011, Zap2It confirmed that actress Jessy Schram, then 25 years old, would be appearing in the new series as Cinderella. While the traditional fairytale involved Cinderella serving her step-mother and step-sisters and eventually being helped by a fairy godmother to marry her prince, Once Upon a Time portrayed her in differing circumstances. Schram explained that her \\"very kind and very sweet\\" character finds herself in an \\"unfortunate situation of having lost someone in her life. The Cinderella that you'll see is a portrayal of someone that's desperate to get out of the situation that she's in. Because of that, some bad decisions are made and she's stuck in even more unfortunate circumstances. Though she's matured through her upbringing and being alone most of the time, she's na√Øve to the outer world.\\" The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale ‚Äì a novelization of the first season ‚Äì which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Cultural references Emma is stated to have lived in Tallahassee for two years, which is a reference to the Lost episode \\"The Man from Tallahassee\\". Ruby's car contains a wolf charm, a reference to her character Red Riding Hood's traditional enemy the Big Bad Wolf. Henry is seen reading an issue of Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, which was written by Damon Lindelof, the co-creator of Lost. Reception =Ratings= \\"The Price of Gold\\" first aired on November 13, 2011 in the United States. The episode scored 3.8/9 among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Among overall viewers, the score was 6.8/10. With an estimated 11.327 million viewers tuning in, it ranked second in its timeslot all together once again behind Football Night In America on NBC but ahead of The Amazing Race on CBS and The Simpsons on the Fox network. The episode was the seventeenth most watched program for the week among all networks. In Canada, the episode finished in sixteenth place for the week, garnering an estimated 1.59 million viewers, a decrease from the 1.732 million of the previous episode. =Reviews= Critics praised Robert Carlyle 's performance The episode was met with positive reviews. Writing for Zap2it, Andrea Reiher considered it to be \\"another excellent episode\\" and gave it a ranking of three out of four. She expressed appreciation for the \\"charismatic and captivating\\" Robert Carlyle, but wished that she could see Schram and other guest stars every week instead of infrequently. Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy was confused as to why Ashley and Sean received a happy ending, wondering that because of the accepted mythology of the curse, \\"aren't people supposed to have happy endings in Fairy Tale, and miserable lives over in Storybrooke?\\" The episode also made Murphy appreciate the \\"bold and bright\\" Snow White, when compared to Cinderella's naive agreement with Rumpelstiltskin. TV Fanatic writer Christine Orlando was not shocked by the affair, but was surprised that \\"Emma fell into Mr. Gold's clutches so easily.\\" Orlando added that she enjoyed the few appearances of Regina, opining that \\"who else could tell you to enjoy your cocoa and make it sound menacing?\\" IGN's Amy Ratcliffe gave the episode 6.5 out of 10, and stated that she \\"like[d] the addition of more fairy tale characters,\\" especially as \\"their stories don't follow traditional paths.\\" Ratcliffe added that \\"the transition between worlds works and has a natural feel. It can't be easy to pull off,\\" but wished that the pace of the main storyline would increase. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava graded the episode with a B and considered it the best of the series up to that point, citing its \\"fair share of forward momentum,\\" Morrison's large amount of screen time, and an improvement in flashbacks. Sava compared it to the previous episode, believing \\"The Price of Gold\\" to be superior because it deviated further from the traditional fairytale formula. He lauded Caryle's \\"more dimensional\\" performance, but said that Regina continued to be a \\"caricature.\\" Sava concluded that Goldman \\"does strong work showing the juxtaposition between reality and fantasy in a less contrived way than last week‚Äôs episode.\\" References External links * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes Category:Works based on Cinderella ","title":"The Price of Gold"},{"id":"33743903","text":"Alfred Carson OBE (7 November 1859 ‚Äì 24 August 1944) was an Australian journalist and social worker.

He commanded several naval vessels during the Gunboat War. His most important action occurred in 1812 at the Battle of Lyng√∏r when a British squadron, led by the British ship-of-the- line , destroyed his vessel, . Holm sustained wounds in the battle but survived, only to drown in an accident shortly afterwards. Biography Holm was born 17 June 1772 at S√∏holm, north of Copenhagen, to ship's master Peter Holm (1725‚Äì1786) and Christence Morslet (1744‚Äì1819). In 1807 he married Marie Heegaard (1791‚Äì1860), daughter of a plantation owner in St Croix in the Danish West Indies (DWI; now the US Virgin Islands). He died 26 October 1812 at Langesundsfjorden, Bamble, Telemark (SW of Oslo), and is buried in Langesund Church. = Early career = At the age of 12, Holm accompanied his father, who was a ship's master in the Danish East India Company, on a strenuous voyage to the East. Upon his return to Denmark in 1785 he enrolled as a cadet at the academy for sea cadets in Copenhagen, from which he graduated on 6 March 1789. As a junior lieutenant, he saw service in the Norske L√∏ve, and in Havfruen with the home squadron. In 1793‚Äì94 he was serving on board the brig on its cruise to the Danish West Indies. After further spells in home waters on board HDMS Fredericksv√¶rn (then acting as a cadet training ship), and HDMS Cronborg, he was aboard in the Mediterranean under the leadership of Steen Andersen Bille during the Danish attack on Tripoli. Holm received promotion to senior lieutenant on 3 November 1798. He then served as the recruiting officer at Arendal, southern Norway. Spells at sea followed, including serving on board HDMS Oldenburg on 15 November 1798 when a severe storm in Table Bay, South Africa, drove the vessel ashore. Holm served again in the Mediterranean in 1800‚Äì01 on the ship Sejeren. = Danish West Indies = Holm traveled to the Danish West Indies (DWI) in 1802 to retake command of which had been surrendered to the British when they had occupied the islands in 1801. Lougen returned to Copenhagen on 7 September 1802. Almost immediately, Holm returned to the DWI for a period of some ten months, but was back in Denmark in June 1804. His next assignment was as a recruiting officer in T√∏nning,T√∏nning is now a German town in Schleswig-Holstein, with the German name of T√∂nning. tasked with stopping foreign vessels hiring Danish seamen. Soon, however, he was back in the DWI as chief pilot and harbour master on St Croix, which positions he retained during the British occupation of the island from December 1807, until the spring of 1809. During his time in the DWI, Holm was promoted to Commander (Kapt Lt) on 1 March 1805. He returned to Europe on an American brig in 1809. Holm then became second-in-command of the ship-of-the- line Pultusk, blockaded in the River Scheldt, until December 1810. = Norwegian service = After his promotion to full captain on 17 March 1811, Holm took command of the brig and was the senior officer of the squadron of similar warships stationed in Norway. In this position he planned and executed patrols along the western coast, which brought him recognition from King Frederick VI. On 1 May 1811 armed boats from Holm's squadron blunted and repelled a raid launched from three British ships on Egersund. The Danes were able to capture one of the raiding boats and her crew, which had come from . On 3 August 1811 he was engaged in a long but inconclusive fight with the formerly Danish brig . (The British had seized Brev Drageren at the battle of Copenhagen in 1807.) While in command of Lolland, Holm captured off Arendal on 2 September 1811. For his success, Holm was appointed captain of the newly built frigate in 1812, but difficulties encountered on her maiden voyage and in training up the new crew and coordinating her movements with the brigs meant that she was not fully combat ready until 1 June 1812. On 2 July 1812 Holm took Najaden to sea from Stavern where some repairs had been made, to sail to Kristiansand, but contrary winds forced him to seek shelter in Sandoya. With a British ship-of-the-line hunting for him, he took Najaden into Lyng√∏r harbour which was considered totally safe from larger warships, but this reckoning proved false and the Battle of Lyng√∏r ensued. The battle ended in a decisive victory of the British forces and Najaden was sunk. = Death = Memorial in Langesund Churchyard for Hans Peter Holm. The inscription (translated) reads: For Hans Peter Holm, Sea Captain and Knight of the Dannebrog, the honoured citizen and brave warrior who found his death in the waves of Langesund Fjord 26 October 1812. This memorial was raised by his grieving comrades-in-arms and friends. Following the catastrophic loss of Najaden, Holm assumed command of a squadron of gunboats based in Sand√∏yasund. Orders to take over the command of a French ship-of-the-line, L'Albanais, were sent to him but never received as, on 26 October 1812, he was overcome in a storm in Langesundsfjord and drowned.

To keep the sauce hot, the company produces only up to a monthly pre- sold quota in order to use only peppers from known sources. The sauce is certified as kosher by the Rabbinical Council of California.Huy Fong Foods at Rabbinical Council of California's website Production The production of Sriracha sauce begins with growing the chilis. The chilis were grown on Underwood Ranch until the two companies ended their relationship in 2016. David Tran, owner of Huy Fong Foods, contracted about of farmland that spreads from Ventura County to Kern County in California. In order to make sriracha, the chili peppers are planted in March. Tran uses a particular type of machinery that reduces waste by mixing rocks, twigs, and unwanted/unusable chilis, back into the soil. The chilis are harvested in mid-July through October and are driven from the farm to the Huy Fong Foods processing facility in Irwindale. Because Tran does not add food coloring to the sauce, each bottle varies in color. At the beginning of the harvest season, the chilis are greener and therefore, the sauce yields a more muted-red color. Later in the season, the sauce produced is bright red. After the chilis are harvested, they are washed, crushed, and mixed with the other ingredients including chili, sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite as preservatives, and Xanthan gum. The sauce is loaded into drums and then distributed into bottles. All drums and bottles are manufactured on-site, to reduce waste and emissions.

History Sriracha by Huy Fong Foods David Tran began making chili sauces in 1975 in his native Vietnam, where his brother grew chili peppers on a farm north of Saigon. In 1978, the Vietnamese government began to crack down on ethnic Chinese in south Vietnam. Tran and three thousand other refugees crowded onto the Taiwanese freighter Huey Fong, heading for Hong Kong. After a month-long standoff with the British authorities, its passengers disembarked on January 19, 1979. Tran was granted asylum in the United States. He started Huy Fong Foods in 1980, naming the company after the refugee ship that brought him out of Vietnam. The sauce was initially supplied to Asian restaurants near his base in Chinatown, Los Angeles, but sales grew steadily by word of mouth. In December 2009, Bon App√©tit magazine named the sauce Ingredient of the Year for 2010. In 2012, over 20 million bottles were sold. Huy Fong Foods says demand has outpaced supply since the company started making the sauce. The company does not advertise because advertising would widen that gap. Huy Fong has boosted production since 2013. Sriracha sauce has grown from a cult taste to one of the food industry's most popular fads. It infuses burgers, sushi, snacks, candy, beverages and even health products. Tran said he was dissuaded from securing a trademark on the word sriracha since it is difficult to obtain one named after a real-life location. This has allowed others to develop their own versions, using the name. Some of the biggest corporations in the business, such as Heinz, Starbucks, Frito-Lay, Applebee's, P.F. Chang's, Pizza Hut, Subway and Jack in the Box, use the name without licensing it. In 2016, Lexus partnered with Huy Fong Foods to build a single promotional Sriracha IS sport sedan. =Lawsuits= In October 2013, the city of Irwindale, California, filed a lawsuit against the Huy Fong Foods factory after approximately 30 residents of the town complained of the spicy smells the factory was emitting while producing Sriracha sauce. The plaintiff initially sought an injunction enjoining Huy Fong from \\"operating or using\\" the plant. On November 27, 2013, Judge Robert H. O'Brien ruled partially in favor of the city, declaring Huy Fong Foods must cease any operations that could be causing the noxious odors and make changes to mitigate them, though he did not order that operations cease completely. According to the judge, although there was a \\"lack of credible evidence\\" linking locals' complaints of breathing trouble and watering eyes to the factory, the odor that could be \\"reasonably inferred to be emanating from the facility\\" is, for residents, \\"extremely annoying, irritating and offensive to the senses warranting consideration as a public nuisance.\\" In late January 2014, the city of Irwindale announced it was expanding its case against Huy Fong Foods to include a claim of breach of contract, alleging that the plant violated a condition of its operating permit by emitting harmful odors. The case was scheduled for jury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on November 3, 2014. On May 29, 2014, it was announced that Irwindale had dropped the lawsuit against Huy Fong Foods. During the legal battles, a Texas delegation offered incentives to move operations to Denton. Other states had also made offers for potential relocation. There is a long history of lawsuits between Huy Fong & Underwood Ranches, its primary supplier of jalape√±os since the 1980s. In 2016, Huy Fong overpaid Underwood by $1.46 million. According to Underwood's lawyer, Tran attempted just before this to hire away Underwood's COO in order to form a new chile-growing concern, breaking the trust between Tran and Underwood. Huy Fong sued Underwood for not paying back this overpayment; Underwood countersued for breach of contract. In July 2019, the case was decided generally in favor of Underwood, with a California jury awarding the grower $10 million in punitive damages and $14.8 million to make up for lost contract revenue between 2016 and 2019. However, the jury also decided that Huy Fong's claim of overpayment was valid, so $1.46 million was deducted from the damages. =Documentary film= Filmmaker Griffin Hammond produced a 33-minute documentary about Sriracha sauce. It was funded with the help of a Kickstarter campaign which raised $21,009‚Äîover four times the goal. The film was released online on December 11, 2013 in advance of submission to film festivals.

P.106 The poem's leitmotif, that of the poet's role as related to the state authorities, for Tolstoy, who was still at the Court, was a serious personal matter. Nikolai Leskov referred to the poem as an autobiographical piece of work of an author who was eager to leave the Court and become a \\"free artist\\".Russkaya Starina, 1895, No.12, —Ä. 212 Tolstoy himself was critical of the poem's beginning and also its Chapter 7.

Dolgorukov in one of his 1863 articles.The Petersburg Sketches, 1934. Moscow, pp.178-179. According to biographer Dmitry Zhukov, Dolgorukov, informed of the forthcoming publication by the Interior Minister Alexander Timashev's agents, ordered to stop the print. Ivan Aksakov sent the proofread lists to Kovalevsky immediately. The latter, knowing already that Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna's impression of the poem had been favourable, ordered the censorship committee to permit the publication. Dolgorukov was outraged: \\"How could you have done this without informing me first?\\" \\"You are not the Prime Minister to demand of me any such thing,\\" Kovalevsky retorted, reportedly. According to the archives, it was Alexander II who, having heard of Ioann Damaskin, asked censors to pay \\"special attention\\" to the poem. Kovalevsky sent his personal report to the emperor, stating: \\"Only some verses, taken out of context might have caused suspicion; otherwise the general idea, the implementation of it, everything about this poem, permeated with the spirit of Early Christianity, dispels doubts.\\" Zhukov, Dmitry.

It began primarily as a response to the growing need for an Indian publishing house for theater and the other arts and since then it has expanded its operations to include translations of world literature as well as twentieth- and twenty-first-century critical theory and non-fiction. At present, the company has registered divisions in London and New York City alongside its initial establishment in Kolkata. Origin Beginning with the series New Indian Playwrights which translated the work of regional Indian playwrights into English, the project grew to accommodate film scripts, especially post-production film scripts. The function of English in India as a link language made it possible for plays composed in the regional languages to be brought onto the same platform and thereby widening the scope of national theater. The series attempted to enhance important play scripts with additional material to provide the interested student, scholar, theater person and reader with more complete access to the script. Theater, the cinema, theoretical writings on the cinema and art made up the initial catalogue of Seagull Books and since its inception, its focus has always laid in the direction of what might be termed as 'the human condition'. Today, Seagull Books is widely considered one of the world‚Äôs most respected publisher of literature in English translation. It publishes over 50 books a year, almost 80 per cent of which are translations from various languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Bengali, Norwegian, Dutch, Turkish and Hungarian, among others. Seagull‚Äôs titles are celebrated for their exquisite covers, designed by senior editor and graphic designer Sunandini Banerjee, and extraordinary production values. Seagull‚Äôs authors include some of the most revered names in twentieth- and twenty-first-century world literature, from Nobel Laureates Jean-Paul Sartre, Imre Kertesz, Elfriede Jelinek, Herta M√ºller and Mo Yan to Jorge Luis Borges, Antonin Artaud, Roland Barthes, Ren√© Char, Max Frisch, Frienrich D√ºrrenmatt, Thomas Bernhard, Christa Wolf, Ingeborg Bachmann, Urs Widmer, Jean Baudrillard, Guy Debord, Alexander Kluge, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Yves Bonnefoy, Philippe Jaccottet, Cees Nooteboom, Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo, Maryse Cond√©, Mahasweta Devi, Pascal Quignard, H√©l√®ne Cixous, Giorgio Agamben, Antjie Krog, William Kentridge, Tomas Espedal, Wolfgang Hilbig, Sibylle Lewitscharoff, Ghassan Zaqtan, Alawiya Sobh, and Man Booker International Prize winner Laszlo Krasznahorkai. Contemporary English- language authors published by Seagull include Zakes Mda, Toby Litt, Tariq Ali, Dan Gunn and philosopher Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Seagull is committed to publishing young contemporary authors; emerging European authors brought to the international arena by Seagull‚Äôs translations include Dorothee Elmiger, Jan Brandt, Gunther Geltinger, Thomas Lehr, Florence Noiville, Lola Lafon, Abdourahman A. Waberi, Monica Cantieni, Melinda Nadj Abonji, Tilman Rammstedt and Abbas Khider, among others. Seagull has been publishing specifically dedicated series of translations under the French List, German List, Swiss List, Norwegian List, Italian List, Hungarian List and, most recently, Arab List and India List; it boasts a backlist of nearly 400 titles, many of which have been widely and very positively reviewed in the international press. Seagull is currently developing two eclectic and important series‚ÄîElsewhere Texts (edited by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Hosam Aboul-Ela, a list that focuses on non-European leftist scholarship) and Pride List (which brings forth queer writing from around the world). Distribution One of the ways Seagull circumvented the problem of being limited to the status of a small independent publishing house catering to a niche market was by securing international distribution that would source its books to a global audience. At present, the University of Chicago Press holds the distribution rights for Seagull Books throughout the world, except India, where it is distributed by Atlantic Publishers and Distributors. This is not co-publication venture; Seagull generally holds world rights for its books. Other Projects =Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre= In 1987, Naveen Kishore founded the Seagull Foundation for the Arts which was to function as a not for profit charitable trust. Under that trust, various activities are carried out, one of which has been the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre. The Resource Centre possesses a vast Arts library where for a nominal sum, one can become a member. Along with the Arts library, there are film and music libraries. Various activities related to performance in the arts are organized and carried out by the Resource Centre; ranging from dance recitals, play readings, photography exhibitions, book reviews to theater workshops. His background in showcasing in the arts helped Naveen Kishore channelise his energy into the Resource Centre. The selling and showcasing of art acts as fundraisers for the revenue earned on the books is not always enough since most of the books published by Seagull are slow sellers and selling the art helps the company to raise money for its non profit enterprises as well as some of the profit activities. =Seagull Foundation for the Arts= The Foundation creates and presents arts exhibitions, major retrospectives by senior artists, focuses on non-saleable aspects or areas of an artist's work that commercial galleries are reluctant to exhibit and conducts research and documents the life and work of respected artists such as the late Nirode Mazumdar.It carries out video-biography projects using the mainstream medium of television to share the lives and professional histories of important artists and translates contemporary plays by playwrights in Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Malayalam, Kannada and Meitei.It has also initiated a Theater for Change project with funding from the UK-based Network for Social Change and collaborates with two Calcutta NGOs that work with women victims of violence and with children from disadvantaged backgrounds. =PeaceWorks= PeaceWorks‚ÄîAn initiative of The Seagull Foundation initially began as a direct response to the Godhra riots of 2002, during which time it was felt that the religious polarization between the Hindu and the Muslim communities needed to be addressed and examined. PeaceWorks thus began with discussing the Hindu- Muslim divide with young children, making them watch films, encouraging them to participate in theater and talk about this difference. Instead of restricting PeaceWorks to just the religious issue, it now talks about living with difference. This could be any kind of difference: physical, sexual or related to gender. It tackles and exposes children to the idea of difference through the arts. Though PeaceWorks is a not for profit charitable trust under the Seagull Foundation for the Arts and has no immediate or direct link with Seagull Books, being an independent organization in itself, there is a great deal of crossover between the two establishments. Being a relatively small organization, staff members from Seagull Books often collaborate on PeaceWorks' projects and help in organizing its events. =The Seagull School of Publishing= The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, in association with Seagull Books and supported by the Royal Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi, established the Seagull School of Publishing in 2012. The institute is located in Calcutta, West Bengal. It offers two professional courses‚Äîin Editing and Book Design. The institute is managed entirely by practicing publishers, editors and designers who are passionate about the craft of publishing. Course duration is three months, and held twice every year (January‚ÄìMarch and June‚ÄìAugust). Seagull School of Publishing offers a platform for prospective editors and book designers to hone their skills. Hands-on training is coupled with interactive sessions with professionals from publishing houses in India and abroad. The courses include field trips to printing presses, research trips to bookstores, open-house discussions on current issues, and projects. Classes focus on a range of subjects from buying and selling of rights in the national‚Äìinternational markets to the phenomenon of e-books and digital publishing. The school is equipped with a state-of-the-art design lab and a well-stocked library to help prepare each student for the global world of publishing. Publications At present, each book published is classified under one of the several series heads. *Seagull World Literature *Swiss List *German List *Italian List *French List *India List *Arab List *Elsewhere Texts *Enactments *In Performance *Manifestos for the 21st Century *Conversation Series *What Was Communism? *Selected Works of Mahasweta Devi *Selected Works of Utpal Dutt *Selected Works of Badal Sircar *Culture Studies *New Indian Playwrights *Performance Theory *Seagull Filmscripts *Film Theory *Art  References   External links  * Category:Book publishing companies of India Category:Companies based in Kolkata Category:Publishing companies established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in India ","title":"Seagull Books"},{"id":"33744133","text":"Ghoria tecta is a moth of the family Erebidae described by Alfred Ernest Wileman in 1910.

Foods are vital components which are consumed by the people at each and every moment for the surviving in the world. Basically there are several kinds of foods are available for the consumption as raw foods, processed foods and modified foods in the market. Moisture content of the food material is important to consider the food is suitable before the consumption, because moisture content affects the physical, chemical aspects of food which relates with the freshness and stability for the storage of the food for a long period of time and the moisture content determine the actual quality of the food before consumption and to the subsequent processing in the food sector by the food producers.  Why food moisture analysis is important  Food moisture analysis involves the amount of moisture content and the concentration of moisture by measuring qualitatively and quantitatively. The food processing companies and the \\"Research and Development\\" (R&D;) people of the food producing company, food related peoples, graduates, undergraduates and the high school students must be well aware of the moisture analysis of the food which do a lot in the food safety and storage conditions and the shelf life of the food. Moisture content analysis is important in determining the shelf life of foods and products = Legal and labeling requirements = Legal limitations regarding the amount of water present in the food is necessary for producing some of the specific products. For example, there should be less than 40% of moisture should be controlled during the production of cheddar cheese. = Economically important requirements = Moisture present in the food material is related with some type of food is dealing with economical values and the big business among industries therefore, food moisture analysis plays a significant role in the modern world. = Shelf life of the food or food products = Further, microbial activity of the food materials favor with the moisture availability in the food. Moisture rich foods are easily susceptible to the microbial attack and got rotted and damaged. Thus the shelf life of the food material is determined by the moisture content in the food. Low moisture foods usually slow down growth of microorganisms hence the need for analysis and control of food moisture. = Food quality measurements = Quality of the food is determined in terms of the food texture, taste, and appearance but moisture content of the food is a determination factor of the quality and the stability of the processed food products. = Food processing operations = Food processing operations are involved with the amount of moisture content present in the food item which is going to be processed for a specific purpose.

Anakiwa is also the terminus of the Queen Charlotte Track, with most hikers choosing to complete their walk here, before catching a water taxi back to Picton. History Anakiwa had long been a MƒÅori settlement, most recently occupied by members of the NgƒÅti RƒÅhiri hap≈´ of Te ƒÄtiawa iwi until 1859 when they returned to Taranaki, at least in part to fight in the First Taranaki War. In earlier centuries, the Ngai Tara iwi had influence over the area. It was included in the New Zealand Company's deed of purchase in 1839, though there is doubt that the chiefs of the region understood the document or that it was correctly translated. In 1864, the New Zealand Government granted land to the Beauchamp family for farming in Anakiwa. In 1928 the family built a guesthouse on the site, which was purchased with donated funds by Hamish Thomas as the site for Outward Bound New Zealand. It was opened as \\"The Cobham Outward Bound School\\" in 1962 by Governor-General Lord Cobham. Tirimoana is a settlement within Anakiwa which was originally known as the Tirimoana Subdivision of the farm lands that once occupied the area to the south and west of Outward Bound School. Boundary Gate Corner which is 3.25 kilometres from the Queen Charlotte Drive intersection, marked the boundary between the two farms in the early 1900s, and a gate once stood here across the access road. Today, there is a sign and bench seat which marks this location. Services Anakiwa has two public wharves, each with a public boat ramp. There are a total of 5 publicly accessible boat ramps along the Anakiwa foreshore. There are numerous lodges, backpacker, and bed & breakfast accommodation within the village, as well as a seasonal store which caters to Queen Charlotte track hikers, as well as other visitors.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2011. In the episode, Kenny and his brother and sister are sent to a foster home after police discover a meth lab in their house. As a result, Cartman is left with feelings of loss, since he no longer has someone to ridicule for their poverty.\\"Episode 1514 'The Poor Kid' Press Release\\". South Park Studios. November 3, 2011 The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA LV in the United States. It lampoons Pabst Blue Ribbon, agnosticism and the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Plot Kenny's parents are arrested for having a meth lab at their home, an event documented on the reality show White Trash in Trouble. As a result, Kenny and his two siblings, Kevin and Karen, are put into the foster care system. Their caseworker, Mr. Adams, who insists on making constant jokes about the Penn State sex abuse scandal, places them with the Weatherheads, a militantly agnostic couple living in Greeley that forbids their numerous foster children from expressing any notions of certainty. Their agnosticism manifests itself in a number of peculiar ways, such as their edict that the children can only drink \\"agnostic beverages\\" such as Dr Pepper, because no one can be certain as to what flavor it is, and hypothesizing that God could be \\"a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything\\". Because of Karen's sadness and fear over their new living situation, Kenny attempts to protect and comfort her by adopting his Mysterion persona, whom she comes to see as her guardian angel. While searching for a new target for his taunts now that Kenny is gone, Cartman is horrified to discover, through Butters' research, that he is now the poorest student in school. He fears that Kyle will start making fun of him now. Despite Kyle's lack of interest in this endeavor, Cartman begins compulsively telling poor jokes about himself to beat Kyle to the punch. Cartman complains to his mother, but she says that she is already working two jobs and cannot do more because of the economy. Wishing he were in a foster home like Kenny, Cartman frames her for running a meth lab, and despite her protests of not having done drugs in a long time, she is arrested, which is again documented by White Trash in Trouble. Despite anticipating being sent to an idyllic setting like Hawaii, Cartman is placed with the Weatherheads and attends the same school in Greeley as Kenny, where he is elated to discover that the poorest student there is not he or Kenny, but a boy named Jacob Hallery, whom Cartman takes delight in ridiculing. After Kenny, as Mysterion, dispatches a bully who was harassing Karen, she and the other foster kids report what they saw to the Weatherheads, who torture one of the children by hosing him down with Dr Pepper for expressing such certainty. In response to the Weatherheads' cruelty, Cartman reports them to Child Protective Services. Mr. Adams comes to the children's rescue, as does Mysterion, who plants Pabst Blue Ribbon in their refrigerator, on which the Weatherheads get drunk. They are then arrested for being unfit guardians, as documented on White Trash in Trouble. Cartman is also arrested on the show for filing a false police report, and Adams urges the police to return all the foster children to their parents, as the foster care system has been embarrassed. Kenny and Cartman return home, but on their first day back at South Park Elementary, a giant Phorusrhacos- esque bird, as Mr. Weatherhead conjectured, rips open the school's roof and eats Kenny, prompting Cartman to burst into tears, once again finding himself the poorest child in school. Production In the creator commentary for the episode, Trey Parker said they went through several ideas of the foster family, rejecting ideas of sending Kenny to a rich family or a family in it for the money before settling on the \\"militant agnostics.\\" This is the first episode where Kenny's siblings are named. The episode prominently features the soft drink Dr Pepper, which commentators have noticed is often featured in the show's background.https://tv.avclub.com/south-park-eek-a-penis-1798204069Seema Gupta, Branding and Advertising, Global India Publications (Sep 27, 2009) page 291 Reception Ryan McGhee of The A.V. Club graded the episode a \\"B‚àí\\". While he thought the Mysterion-Karen plot gave the episode true pathos, he thought Adams' jokes seemed recycled, and the parody of agnostics were funny but par for the course in terms of South Park's treatment of religion, and not very relevant. Katie McGlynn of The Huffington Post and Aly Semigram of Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode's take on the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, complimenting the show's creators on satirizing the matter without coming across as insensitive, and for mocking not only the scandal, but the manner in which Cartman rebuked the jokes for merely recycling old Catholic jokes.McGlynn, Katie. \\"'South Park' Mocks Penn State Scandal Jokes\\". The Huffington Post. November 17, 2011Semigram, Aly. \\"'South Park' tries to go for laughs with the Penn State scandal\\". Entertainment Weekly. November 17, 2011 Lindsey Bahr of SplitSider also thought initially that the Penn State and \\"Yo mamma\\" jokes were lacking, and the plot jumpy and convoluted, but then perceived that to be the point of the episode, opining that the final act was \\"poignant\\", and the episode the most self-reflective since the mid-season finale.Bahr, Lindsey. \\"South Park Recap: 'The Poor Kid'\\". SplitSider. November 17, 2011 Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline gave the episode an 8 out of 10, feeling that it was an improvement over the previous episode, and said of its treatment of the Penn State matter: \\"Parker & Stone seem well within their lampooning grounds with this one, without trying to put a larger sociopolitical statement on an issue in which there is very little grey area.\\" Firecloud characterized the episode's closing moments as \\"solid old-school Kenny death finish. Bravo.\\"Firecloud, Johnny. \\"SOUTH PARK 15.14 'The Poor Kid'\\". CraveOnline. November 17, 2011 Ramsey Isler of IGN was disappointed that the McCormick siblings' placement in foster care turned out not to be a big turning point for Kenny, but simply another \\"joke of the week\\". Isler felt, however, that it was a decent episode with a long string of small but enjoyable gags, in particular those that poked fun at the rote repetition of stale jokes, and the treatment of agnosticism, which he found to be \\"fresh\\".
