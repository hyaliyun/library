An expert in numerous scientific disciplines, Anderson's work combined seismology, solid state physics, geochemistry and petrology to explain how the Earth works. Anderson was best known for his contributions to the understanding of the Earth's deep interior, and more recently, for the hypothesis that hotspots are the product of plate tectonics rather than narrow plumes emanating from the deep Earth. Anderson was Professor (Emeritus) of Geophysics in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He received numerous awards from geophysical, geological and astronomical societies. In 1998 he was awarded the prestigious Crafoord Prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences along with Adam Dziewonski. Later that year, Anderson received the National Medal of Science. He held honorary doctorates from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he did his undergraduate work in geology and geophysics) and the University of Paris (Sorbonne), and served on numerous university advisory committees, including those at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, University of Chicago, Stanford, University of Paris, Purdue University, and Rice University. Anderson's wide-ranging research resulted in hundreds of published papers in the fields of planetary science, seismology, mineral physics, petrology, geochemistry, tectonics and the philosophy of science. He continued to work and publish until his death. His widely known textbooks, Theory of the Earth, and New Theory of the Earth are regarded by colleagues as compelling syntheses of the origins of the Earth and its inner workings by one of the great geophysical authorities of our time.  Life and main scientific contributions  Receiving the National Medal of Science from President Bill ClintonDon and Nancy Anderson celebrating their 50th Wedding AnniversaryThe cover of Anderson's book, New Theory of the Earth illustrates the ongoing debate among geophysicists over whether volcanoes are the natural outcome of plate tectonics or emanate from the deep Earth through narrow plumes.Born in Frederick, Maryland in 1933, Anderson moved to Baltimore when he was six. He graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute then attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) where he earned a Bachelor of Science in geology and geophysics in 1955. He then worked in the oil industry in California, Montana and Wyoming, and served in the Air Force in Massachusetts and Thule, Greenland before moving to California, where he received a Ph.D. in geophysics and mathematics at Caltech in 1962. He spent most of his subsequent academic career at Caltech's Seismological Laboratory, becoming its second longest serving director from 1967 to 1989. He was married to Nancy Ruth Anderson, had two children, Lynn Anderson Rodriguez and Lee Weston Anderson, and four granddaughters. Anderson began his scientific career while serving in the U.S. Air Force. In Greenland, he studied the properties of sea ice. Anderson was charged with determining whether the ice was strong enough to withstand the landing of heavy aircraft. In working with his colleague, Dr. Wilford Weeks, on scientific papers resulting from the research, it became clear to Anderson that he needed more education. He chose to attend Caltech in geophysics. Anderson's thesis focused on the anisotropic, or directionally dependent, properties of the mantle. It analyzed wave propagation in layered complex media. Prior to Anderson's work, seismologists had assumed that the Earth's interior behaved like glass, and was isotropic. After completing his Ph.D. in 1962, Anderson joined the faculty at Caltech and moved on to other areas of study, writing papers on the composition, physical state, and origin of the Earth as well as other planets. Much later in his career, he returned to the effects of anisotropy and partial melting and the presence of fluids in the upper mantle. He and his colleagues developed methods for taking into account anisotropy and the non-elastic behavior of seismic waves to explain how the Earth works. The technical terms for the subjects of his studies are anharmonicity, asphericity, anelasticity, as well as anisotrophy. In other words, the Earth is not an ideal, elastic sphere. During his more than 50-year career, Anderson published papers on the composition and origin of the Moon, Venus and Mars as well as Earth. He was a principal investigator on the Viking mission to Mars in 1971. Anderson and his collaborators investigated the relations between the behavior of mantle rock under high pressures and temperatures, phase transformations of mantle minerals, and the generation of earthquakes. They contributed significantly to the understanding of tectonic plate motions by mapping convection currents in the Earth's mantle using seismological methods. These studies led to the development of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), which provides standard values for Earth's important properties, including seismic velocities, density, pressure, attenuation, and anisotropy as a function of planetary radius and wavelength. PREM is now the standard reference model for the Earth. This work was cited when Anderson, along with his colleague Adam Dziewonski of Harvard University, were awarded the Crafoord Prize in 1998 in Sweden. By taking into account the physics and thermodynamics of Earth materials under the high temperature and pressure conditions in the deep interior, Anderson developed theories that depart from mainstream scientific speculations. In particular, Anderson showed that the standard geochemical and evolutionary models for the Earth are flawed because they violate the laws of thermodynamics in ways that would make Earth behave as a perpetual motion machine. Anderson likened these models to Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust-So Stories,‚Äù and pointed out that these flawed theories are perpetuated when countervailing evidence is explained away as anomalies or paradoxes. Anderson's models are based on physics and thermodynamics as well as geophysics, and stand up to observations and evidence-based tests. Anderson developed an alternative model of the mineralogical and isotopic composition of the mantle. The Earth had a high-temperature origin and has been chemically stratified since it accreted 4.5 billion years ago. Conventional scientific wisdom is that the entire mantle is largely made up of olivine-dominated peridotite, some of it primordial material. Anderson, on the other hand, showed that the mid-mantle is composed of piclogite, a pyroxene and garnet- rick rock. Counter to prevailing scientific views, Anderson argued that the deeper layers of the mantle are dense and refractory and unable to rise to the surface or to produce basalts. Anderson suggested that all basalts are produced in the upper mantle. These ideas evolved from the integration of geochemistry, petrology, seismology, and thermodynamics, while standard models are based only on one or two of these disciplines and many assumptions. Anderson also challenged traditional scientific views on how volcanoes are formed, particularly, the theory of convective mantle plumes in the Earth, as proposed by W. Jason Morgan, Anderson argued that the so-called mantle plume hypothesis is invalid and that hotspots and oceanic islands such as Hawaii or Iceland are, instead, the normal products of plate tectonics. While many geochemists believe that volcanoes stem from narrow plumes coming up from just above the Earth's core, Anderson showed that they can be explained entirely by chemical and mineralogical anomalies in the upper mantle. Moreover, Anderson pointed out that all demonstrations of the mantle plume hypothesis violate the basic laws of thermodynamics because they rely on a constant supply of heat coming from the deep Earth or even from outside the Earth. Anderson, on the other hand, accepted the classical view that the Earth's interior is cooling and that volcanoes simply tap a layer of melted rock that exists in the upper mantle, or outer shell of the Earth. It is through the movement of the plates that the magma is allowed to reach the surface through fracture zones, rifts, volcanoes and so-called hot spots. Anderson also considered that plate tectonics is a natural result of a planet being cooled from above.Harding, Stephan. Animate Eart. Science, Intuition and Gaia. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2006, p. 114. Although his work was based on seismology, classical physics and thermodynamics as well as his knowledge of the Earth's interior, Anderson's theories are considered to be controversial because they depart from the prevailing ideas developed by the geochemical community and which are widely cited in influential publications such as Nature and Science. An active website, mantleplumes.org, is devoted to the challenge by Anderson and his colleagues to standard, or text-book explanations of volcanoes and Earth dynamics. Anderson's multidisciplinary approach, combined with his expertise in geophysics, geochemistry, solid-state physics, and thermodynamics, enabled him to explain the evolution and structure of the Earth in ways that challenge accepted ideas of his time. Colleague Seth Stein of Northwestern University said of Anderson's New Theory of the Earth: ‚ÄúAn old adage says that there are no true students of the Earth because we dig our small holes and sit in them. This book is a striking counter example that synthesizes a broad range of topics dealing with the planet‚Äôs structure, evolution, and dynamics. Even readers who disagree with some of the arguments will find them insightful and stimulating.‚Äù Anderson died in Cambria, California on December 2, 2014 from cancer, at the age of 81. Technical details * Showed that anisotropy and anelasticity were important in the propagation of seismic waves in the Earth. * Introduced frequency dependent and polarization effects into modern seismology. This made it possible to resolve discrepancies between various types of seismic data (body waves, normal models; Rayleigh-Love wave discrepancy) and to combine all types of data into a single inversion. * Developed theory for frequency dependence of both wavespeeds and anelasticity (Q) and applied this to the mantle and core (Absorption Band Model). * Developed methods for inverting surface waves for anisotropic structures (Universal Dispersion Curves). * Showed (with Minster) how microphysics could explain how short period phenomena could be related to long term rheology. * With Nataf, Nakanishi, Tanimoto, Montagner, Regan developed first 3D structures of the anisotropic mantle.

Since the 16th century the site has been a school. Notable past alumni include the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and the German chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg. Today, it is a well-known public boarding school for academically gifted children, called Landesschule Pforta. It is coeducational and teaches around 300 high school students. Pforta is proposed for inscription in the World Heritage List as one component of the German nomination Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut. History =Monastery= Pforta, Altes Schulhaus The abbey was at first situated in Schm√∂lln on the Sprotta, near Altenburg. In 1127, Count Bruno of Pleissengau founded a Benedictine monastery there and endowed it with 1,100 hides of land. This foundation not being successful, on 23 April 1132, , a relative of Bruno's, replaced the Benedictines by Cistercian monks from Walkenried Abbey. The situation here proved undesirable, and in 1137 Udo transferred the monastery to Pforta, and conferred upon it fifty hides of arable land, an important tract of forest, and two farms belonging to the diocese. The patroness of the abbey was the Blessed Virgin Mary. The first abbot was Adalbert, from 1132 to 1152. Under the third abbot, Adetold, two daughter houses were founded under Pforta's auspices, in the Mark of Meissen and in Silesia, and in 1163, the monasteries of Altzella and Leubus were also established in the latter province. At this period the monks numbered about eighty. In 1205, Pforta sent a colony of monks to Livonia, founding there the monastery of D√ºnam√ºnde. The abbey was distinguished for its excellent system of management, and after the first 140 years of its existence its possessions had increased tenfold. At the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th centuries, after a period of strife, the monastery flourished again. The last quarter of the 14th century witnessed, however, the gradual decline of its prosperity, and also the relaxation of monastic discipline. When Abbot Johannes IV was elected in 1515, there were forty-two monks and seven lay brothers who later revolted against the abbot; an inspection by Duke George of Saxony reported that morality had ceased to exist in the monastery. The last abbot, Peter Schederich, was elected in 1533. When the Catholic Duke George was succeeded by his Protestant brother Henry, the monastery was suppressed on 9 November 1540, with the abbot, eleven monks, and four lay brothers being pensioned off. =Boarding school= F√ºrstenhaus In 1543, Henry's son Duke Moritz opened a national school in the abbey,Landesschule Pforta's English website appropriating for its use the revenues of the suppressed monastery of Memleben Abbey. At first the number of scholars was 100; in 1563 fifty more could be accommodated. The first rector was Johann Gigas, renowned as a lyric poet. Under Justinus Bertuch (1601‚Äì1626) the school attained the zenith of its prosperity. It suffered greatly during the Thirty Years' War, in 1643, there being only eleven scholars. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Pforta belonged to Prussia, and then to Imperial Germany. From 1935 until 1945 Schulpforta served as a Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt (NPEA). The NPEAs (37 in all) promoted National Socialist (Nazi) ideals, encouraging boys between the ages of 11 and 18 to pursue occupations (including the SS) which supported the National Socialist cause.http://helenroche.com/work/wanderer-kommst-du-nach- pfortahttp://www.saale-unstrut-tourismus.de/en/pforta-abbey In 1949, the institute became co-educational. Today the school is maintained by the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, but still supported by its own Schulpforta Foundation. Architecture The remains of the monastery include the 13th century gothic church; it is a cross-vaulted, colonnaded basilica with an extraordinarily long nave, a peculiar western fa√ßade, and a late Romanesque double-naved cloister. What remains of the original building (1137‚Äì40) is in the Romanesque style, while the restoration (1251‚Äì1268) belongs to the early Gothic.

They are the largest insects in the order Hemiptera. There are about 170 species found in freshwater habitats worldwide, with more than 110 in the Neotropics, more than 20 in Africa, almost as many in the Nearctic, and far fewer elsewhere. These predators are typically encountered in freshwater ponds, marshes and slow- flowing streams. Most species are at least long, although smaller species, down to , also exist. The largest are members of the genus Lethocerus, which can exceed and nearly reach the length of some of the largest beetles in the world. Giant water bugs are a popular food in parts of Asia.  Morphology  The largest Hemiptera in the world are Lethocerus (L. oculatus shown) Belostomatids have a flattened, obovoid to ovoid-elongate body, and usually the legs are flattened. The hind tarsi have two apical claws and tucked behind the eyes is a short antennae. A short breathing tube can be retracted into its abdomen. Adults cannot breathe under water, so must periodically place the breathing tube at the surface for air (similar to a snorkel). Their frontal legs are modified into raptorial appendages that they use to grab their prey, except in the African Limnogeton, which has \\"normal\\" frontal legs and is a specialized snail-eater. Once caught, the prey are stabbed with their proboscis and a powerful saliva is injected, allowing the Belostomatid to suck out the liquefied remains. Wing pads can be seen from the dorsal view. While the members of the subfamily Lethocerinae can disperse by flying, other species, including Abedus herberti, have a greatly reduced flight apparatus and are flightless.  Habits  Male Abedus herberti with eggs on his back =Feeding and defense= Belostomatids are aggressive predators that stalk, capture, and feed on fish, amphibians, as well as aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crustaceans. The largest species have also been found to capture and feed on baby turtles and water snakes. They often lie motionless at the bottom of a body of water, attached to various objects, where they wait for prey to come near. They then strike, injecting a venomous digestive saliva with their rostrum. Although their bite is excruciatingly painful, it is of no medical significance. Occasionally, when encountered by a larger animal, such as a human, they have been known to \\"play dead\\" and most species can emit a fluid from their anus. Due to this, they are assumed dead by humans only to later \\"come alive\\" with painful results. =Breeding= Male (red tag) and female (blue tag) Abedus copulating Belostomatids show paternal care and these aspects have been studied extensively, among others involving the North American Belostoma flumineum and the East Asian Lethocerus (Kirkaldyia) deyrollei. In species of the subfamily Belostomatinae, the eggs are typically laid on the male's wings and carried until they hatch. The male cannot mate during this period. The males invest considerable time and energy in reproduction and females take the role of actively finding males to mate. This role reversal matches the predictions of R. L. Trivers' parental investment theory. In the subfamily Lethocerinae, the eggs are laid on emergent vegetation and guarded by the male. In Asian cuisine Fried giant water bugs at a market in Thailand In some areas, belostomatids are considered a delicacy, and can be found for sale in markets. This is mainly in South and Southeast Asia involving the species Lethocerus indicus. In South and Southeast Asia they are often collected for this purpose using large floating traps on ponds, set with black lights to attract the bugs. Adults fly at night, like many aquatic insects, and are attracted to lights during the breeding season.

In 1974, his first album was released under the title \\"Benimle Oynar Mƒ±sƒ±n?\\" (Will You Play with Me?), considered to be a classic. Onno Tun√ß and Ergun Pekcan were among those who helped the recording and mastering of his albums. He took a ten-year break from music after he got married. During this time, he worked as a chemical engineer at companies like Pfizer and Neta≈ü Telecom. During 1985, Orta√ßgil played with Fikret Kƒ±zƒ±lok at \\"√áekirdek M√ºzikevi\\"; this performance yielded to a non-published copy album \\"Bizim ≈ûarkƒ±larƒ±mƒ±z ‚Ä¶\\".

The town was located on the bank of the Klyazma River about twelve kilometres from the modern-day Kovrov. Nowadays, the village of Klyazminsky Gorodok stands on the spot. During the Mongol invasion of Russia, the youngest of Vsevolod III's sons, Ivan, made Starodub his seat (1238). His descendants ruled the tiniest of Russian principalities for more than a century, desperately trying to fend off attacks by two powerful neighbours-- Muscovy and Nizhny Novgorod. Their ephemeral power came to an end in the 1370s, when the town was eventually annexed by Dmitry Donskoy. Thereupon numerous scions of Starodub dynasty moved to Moscow, where they formed the families of Princes Gagarin, Khilkoff, Romodanovsky, Pozharsky, and many others. During the Time of Troubles, the town was completely burnt to the ground by the Polish warlord Alexander Jozef Lisowski, who ravaged the area in March 1609.

History George David Cummins, founding bishop In the 19th century, as the Oxford Movement urged that the Protestant Episcopal Church and the Church of England return to Anglicanism's roots in pre-Reformation Catholic Christianity, George David Cummins, the Assistant Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Kentucky, became concerned about the preservation of Protestant, Evangelical, Reformed, and Confessional principles within the church.William Simcox Bricknell (1845) The judgment of the bishops upon tractarian theology, books.google.com The founding of the Reformed Episcopal Church followed an 1873 controversy about ecumenical activity. In October of that year, Bishop Cummins joined with Dean Smith of Canterbury, William Augustus Muhlenberg, and some non-Anglican ministers at an ecumenical conference of the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance. During the conference, held in New York City, Cummins, Smith and the non- Episcopalian ministers presided at joint services of Holy Communion without using any version of the Book of Common Prayer. Retired missionary bishop, William Tozer, who was visiting New York at the time, criticized Smith and implicitly Cummins for participating in the rite.Allen C.

Bishop Cummins defended his actions in a letter published 10 days later, but after criticisms from Anglo-Catholic clergy and others for his choice not to seek preaching permission from the bishop in whose diocese he was preaching without authorization (New York), he submitted a letter of resignation to his own bishop on November 10. Three weeks later, joined by 21 Episcopalian clergy and lay people, Cummins organized the first general council of the Reformed Episcopal Church in New York City on December 2, 1873. Bishop Cummins and his followers considered his action not rash decisions but simply decisive action, founded upon their long-held convictions about the growing Anglo-Catholic practices within the church. While these practices had existed from the founding of the Church of England, the Tractarian or Oxford Movement had been growing in influence, much to Cummins' dismay. He described his understanding's evolution in a letter to Bishop Cheney, stressing his earlier attempts to create reforms within the Protestant Episcopal Church. \\"We went before the General Conventions of 1868 and 1871 with petitions signed by hundreds of clergymen and laymen from all parts of the land, asking relief for Evangelical men. We asked but three things, the use of an alternate phrase in the baptismal office for infants, the repeal of the canon closing our pulpits against all non-Episcopal clergymen, and the insertion of a note in the Prayer-book, declaring the term \\"Priest\\" to be of equivalent meaning with the word Presbyter. We were met by an indignant and almost contemptuous refusal.\\"Following the Light, Bp. George David Cummins 1876 at http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/rec/cummins/following1876.html These failed earlier attempts and Tozer's criticism of the ecumenical communion service Cummins thought an opportunity for decisive action. Some in the Protestant Episcopal Church saw Cummins' decision as schismatic. Others, however, disagreed. One correspondent of the publication \\"The Episcopalian\\" said, \\"If we say that this new church has begun in schism, the church of Rome alleges the same things against us. The real question is, which party is guilty of the schism, the party which separates and goes out? or the party that forces the separation, by making binding on the conscience what Christ has not made binding?\\" Alan Guelzo, \\"For the Union of Evangelical Christendom\\", p.194 Rather than characterize this as schism, Bishop Cummins and his fellow reformers portrayed themselves as providing a Protestant, Anglican identity under which there could be a 'closer union of all Evangelical Christendom.' \\"The Reformed Episcopal Church would be what the Protestant Episcopal Church might have become had it not been paralyzed by the Tractarian virus.\\"Alan Guelzo, For the Union of Evangelical Christendom, p. 160. The term \\"Reformed\\" was never intended to denote any Calvinistic sense of Reformed theology, but was intended to convey Cummins' purpose of an Episcopal Church that had been reformed against Catholic influences [the founders of the church would often stylise the name as The Re-Formed Episcopal Church, for disambiguation so that it was known this was the Episcopal Church Re-Formed and not of a reformed theology]. Bishop Cummins was in attendance at a Convention on 21 October 1868 and was greatly disappointed by the \\"Catholic\\" practices which he witnessed: \\"[a]ltars erected, with super-altars, with burning candles, and floating clouds of incense; the communion service set in a Roman framework ... there is a departure from the doctrinal basis of the Reformation.\\"Alan Guelzo, \\"For the Union of Evangelical Christendom\\", pp. 108-9. Cummins' feelings grew stronger after reading an essay titled \\"Are There Romanising Germs in the Prayer Book?\\" which asserted that the Romanisation of the church and the Holy Eucharistic service was not an influence from the outside but, rather came from inside the church - it was in the Prayer Book itself, thus; Cummins started pushing stronger against the \\"Roman germs\\" which sadly, caused him to lose friends on both sides: Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals alike.Alan Guelzo, \\"For the Union of Evangelical Christendom\\", pp. 109-112. The REC has had several periods of a general distinct theology. Although it began as a way to preserve Protestantism within the Anglican identity, the Anglican aspect of the identity began to fade over time. With its growing and heavy emphasis on ecumenical relations with other Protestants, many of those who converted or were confirmed in the REC had identities from various other Protestant backgrounds. Due to this influx and the short-lived bishopric of the founders, the typical Reformed Episcopalian went from a Protestant, Latitudinarian pathos to a more Dispensationalist persuasion in a relatively short period of time, much of this happening in the early 1900s. Over the following several decades, the REC made the transition to more Reformed theology in the Calvinistic sense. It was not until the 1970s that the Presiding Bishop, Leonard Riches, pushed for the revitalization of Anglican theology and identity in the REC. =Early growth= In the United States Within six months of its founding in 1873, the REC grew to about 1,500 communicants, two bishops and 15 other ministers.Price, p. 154. In 1875, over 500 African- American Protestant Episcopal communicants in South Carolina's Low Country joined the REC as a group.Price, p. 164, 241‚Äì242. In Canada Within a year from the founding of the REC, like-minded Canadian Anglicans in New Brunswick and Ontario seceded from that Church and formed Reformed Episcopal congregations. In October 1874, Edward Cridge, dean of the Anglican cathedral in Victoria, British Columbia, withdrew with about 350 of his congregation to form the Church of Our Lord and join the Reformed Episcopal Church.Church of Our Lord: History Cridge was consecrated a bishop for the REC in 1876.Price, 234‚Äì238. Many of the Canadian Reformed Episcopal Churches joined the United Church at its founding. The Reformed Episcopal Church now has three churches in Canada, two in British Columbia and one in Ontario. St. George's Church, Hamilton is affiliated with the Diocese of the Northeast in the US, and both Holy Trinity Church in Colwood and Living Word in Courtenay are a part of the Diocese of Western Canada and Alaska. In England In 1877, in response to a petition from REC sympathizers in England, the REC's Fifth General Council acted to establish the Reformed Episcopal Church in that country.Price, p. 227. Former Church of England minister Thomas Huband Gregg was consecrated a bishop to lead adherents there. By 1910 there were 28 ministers and 1,990 communicant members constituting the Reformed Episcopal Church in that country. In 1927, the Reformed Episcopal Church in England merged with the Free Church of England. =Developments since 2000= Eastern Canada diocese merged In 2009, Bishop Michael Fedechko retired as ordinary of the Diocese of Central and Eastern Canada, and the diocese's parishes came under the supervision of the Diocese of the Northeast and Mid- Atlantic.Selected Reports from the Reformed Episcopal Church 53rd General CouncilMinutes of 139th Council of the Diocese of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Bishop Fedechko subsequently became affiliated with the Independent Anglican Church Canada Synod.

Accessed: 2009.01.09. =Dioceses= United States The Reformed Episcopal Church was originally divided into four synods. The synods were renamed dioceses in 1984. As of 2016, there are four U.S. dioceses with 108 parishes and missions: * The Diocese of the Central States, founded in 2008, achieved full diocesan status in 2011. It has 17 parishes and missions in seven states and is led by Daniel Morse and Peter Manto, Coadjutor Bishop. * The Diocese of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, with the Convocation of Eastern Canada, created from the original New York and Philadelphia Synod, has 28 parishes and missions in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ontario, led by David L. Hicks. R. Charles Gillin serves as Suffragan Bishop. * The Diocese of Mid-America, with the Convocation of the West and Western Canada, created from the original Synod of Chicago, has 31 parishes and missions, was led by the late Royal U. Grote Jr., with the Coadjutor being Ray Sutton. The Assisting Bishop for Canada and Cuba is Charles Dorrington. * The Diocese of the Southeast, created from the early formed Charleston-Charlotte and Atlanta Synod, with 32 parishes and missions in South Carolina, led by Alphonza Gadsden and with the Coadjutor Bishop being William White. From 2008 to 2016 an additional U.S. Diocese of the West existed. It had been formed as a Missionary Diocese from the Diocese of Mid- America and attained full diocesan status when churches from the Anglican Province of America joined the REC in 2008, led by Winfield Mott. In April 2016, the diocesan synod voted to dissolve the diocese due to its small size and merge with ACNA's Missionary Diocese of All Saints. The Diocese of Western Canada and Alaska, created in 1996, had two parishes in British Columbia, led by Charles Dorrington, and also included the Missionary District of Cuba. Due to his small size, the diocese was extinct and incorporated in the Diocese of Mid-America as the Convocation of the West and Western Canada, of which Charles Dorrington is an Assisting Bishop.Diocese of Mid-America at the Reformed Episcopal Church Official Website Other countries * The Missionary Diocese of Cuba, with over 30 parishes and missions, is under the supervision of Bishop Charles Dorrington, with William Mendez Suarez as Suffragan Bishop. * The Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia has three parishes and two missions in Croatia. It became the jurisdiction of the REC in 2011. The PRCC was founded in 2001 when several parishes left the Reformed Christian Church in Croatia. The Assistant Bishop is Jasmin Miliƒá. * In Germany, one of three expressions of the Anglican Church in Germany called \\"Reformierte Episkopalkirche\\" (www.rekd.de). It has ten congregations and missions. The Bishop Ordinary is Gerhard Meyer. The other two expressions are the Diocese of Europe of the Church of England and the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe from the USA. *The Reformed Episcopal Church in China had been existing under the administration of the Presbyterian church from the year 2000, but in 2007 there was a shift in paradigm whereby the church stood on her own and adopted the Episcopal system of administration. There are four active parishes in Xi'an China and Bishop Dong is presiding over the Reformed Episcopal Church in China. Relations with other jurisdictions =Formation of Anglican Church in North America= In 2009, the REC became a founding member of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA),The provisional constitution of ACNA is at http://www.united- anglicans.org/about/provisional-constitution.html a denomination seeking to create a new Anglican Communion province distinct from the Episcopal Church. ACNA is in communion with the Anglican Churches of Uganda, Nigeria and Sudan, with approximately 30 million members worldwide, representing approximately one-third of the faithful of the Anglican Communion. Anglican Church of Nigeria (estimate)2002 Uganda Population and Housing Census , Ugandan Bureau of Statisticshttp://www.aco.org/index.cfm The Anglican Communion Official Website =Earlier developments= The REC in North America has been in full communion with the Free Church of England since 1927, when Reformed Episcopal congregations and clergy in England merged with the FCE. Bishops of the two churches take part in episcopal consecrations of the other, and there are periodic visits between them. On occasion REC clergy have served in FCE parishes and vice versa.http://www.fcofe.org.uk The Free Church of England As of 2018, there are two FCE dioceses in England and one diocese in South America. In 1998 the REC signed a concordat of intercommunion for the first time with an Anglo-Catholic communion, the Anglican Province of America (APA).Articles of Intercommunion, http://www.anglicanprovince.org/ccrec2.html A 2005 renewal of the agreement also established intercommunion with the Anglican Communion's Church of Nigeria.http://www.anglican- nig.org/covenant_union.htm Anglican Communion's Church of Nigeria Episcopal Church News Service article This agreement of intercommunion between Reformed Episcopal Church and Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) gives privilege for Church of Nigeria Priests in diaspora to be licensed and practice in any jurisdiction of REC. Recently in 2018 NEMA-REC accepted and license priests who are immigrants in United State. An additional proposal would have led to an eventual merger between the APA and the REC, Mark Clavier, \\"History of the Anglican Province of America\\" but the APA's decision not to join the new Anglican Church in North America in 2008 is an obstacle to the proposed merger. Social involvement George David Cummins, the founding bishop of the REC, was the son of a slaveholder. His view of slavery was that there was nothing inherently sinful about slave-holding and that the practice, in and of itself, was never condemned in Scripture as being an abomination to God or harmful to mankind. Cummins qualified this statement with certain opinions pertaining to the practice. According to Cummins the African-American slave is \\"of one blood with ourselves, a sharer in common humanity, a partaker of our hopes and fear.\\" Although Cummins was not anti-slavery, his view of slavery and the African-American differ drastically from that of many of his contemporaries. Indeed, many pro-slavers would not be thrilled at the notion of sharing of one blood or human commonality. This attitude of Cummins did not compel him to endorse emancipation, however, it did convince him of a kind of paternalism. Cummins charged slaveholders to be more responsible and caring of their slaves: \\"The Anglo-American [is] the tutelar guardian of the African,\\" adding that it is the responsibility of white Americans \\"to regard the African race in bondage as a solemn trust committed to these people from God, and that He has given this great mission of working out His purposes and mercy and love towards them.\\" Cummins may have seen slavery as something that ought to train and discipline those in bondage as preparation for starting their own country/continent. Cummins was not an emancipationist, but was of the mind that freed slaves should return to Africa and create a livelihood for themselves.Guelzo, Allen C. For the Union of Evangelical Christendom, p. 90-91. =REC and the ordination of black clergy= The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution brought an end to the system of slavery that had kept American blacks in bondage since colonial times.Alan Guelzo, \\"For the Union of Evangelical Christendom\\", p. 219. After slavery was abolished, there was somewhat of a cultural crisis in the Southern states. Even though black Americans had received their freedom from the unjust practice of slavery, they also lost a consistent form of shelter, food, and worship. Almost overnight, these became things that tens of thousands of freed slaves now had to provide for by themselves. As if this hurdle were not enough, many white Americans, uncomfortable with this societal change, created, endorsed, and enforced Jim Crow laws as a way to segregate and suppress black Americans. One form of this discriminatory injustice was to segregate churches, chapels, and congregations. There were now black churches with black clergy and officiates seeking inclusion into various denominations and dioceses. While some dioceses of the Episcopal Church were more open to the inclusion of black congregations, there were many dioceses who, as a collective whole, disowned and rejected blacks from the Episcopal communion. Frank C. Ferguson, a former slave and a minister of a black congregation, experienced such discrimination. This ultimately led his congregation, and four others, to leave the Protestant Episcopal Church and move to the REC. Despite his earlier comments on slavery and emancipation, Bishop Cummins gladly welcomed black congregations and clergy into the REC. By doing so, Cummins had scored an important moral point by rising above the \\"color line\\" and making the REC's declarations about openness and liberty more than theological vocabulary. Of course, Cummins had not imagined that either he or the REC would become pioneers of racial justice, and in the 1870s he faced as much reluctance from Northern whites in his own General Council as from South Carolina whites in their diocesan convention. But Cummins could not square his own dreams of ecumenicity with racial exclusivism. The Reformed Episcopal Seminary itself is one of the first, if not the first, seminaries to be racially inclusive.Alan Guelzo, For the Union of Evangelical Christendom, p. 219-28. Doctrine =Founding principles= The founders of the Reformed Episcopal Church professed a faith rooted in the English Reformation, regarding the Holy Scripture as the Word of God, and accepting the authority of the Nicene, Apostles' and Athanasian Creeds, the first four ecumenical councils, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion (in the form published in 1801 by the Protestant Episcopal Church), and the Declaration of Principles of the Reformed Episcopal Church.The Constitutions and Canons of the Reformed Episcopal Church, Version 3.2, October 2008 They emphasized the Protestant, Reformed, Evangelical and Reformational aspects in the history of the Church of England, making frequent allusions to Archbishop Cranmer, Bishop Ridley, Bishop Hugh Latimer, Bishop John Hooper, Archbishop Matthew Parker, Bishop John Jewel, Archbishop Edmund Grindal and other Reformers in the Church of England.Voices of the Past ‚Äì Truths for the Present, 2nd edition, Jan 1995, Reformed Episcopal Church Early leaders of the Church, in lectures and sermons, warned against Ritualism as a denominational proclivity in the Episcopal Church.Reasons for Entering the Reformed Episcopal Church, Address delivered by John McDowell Leavitt, Oct 20, 1889, Reformed Episcopal Church Concluding the final day of the First General Convention of The Reformed Episcopal Church, December 2, 1873, the principles and ethos were summarized: > \\"One in heart and in faith with our fathers, who at the very beginning of > this nation sought to mold and fashion the ecclesiastical polity which they > had inherited from the Reformed Church of England, by a judicious and > thorough revision of the Book of Common Prayer, we return to their positions > and claim to be the old and true Protestant Episcopalians of the days > immediately succeeding the American Revolution, and through these, our > ancestors, we claim an unbroken historical connection through the Church of > England, with the Church of Christ, from the earliest Christian > community.\\"Price, p. 123. Declaration of Principles The first general council of the REC approved this declaration on 2 December 1873: > 1\\\\. The Reformed Episcopal Church, holding \\"the faith once delivered unto > the saints\\", declares its belief in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New > Testaments as the Word of God, as the sole rule of Faith and Practice; in > the Creed \\"commonly called the Apostles' Creed;\\" in the Divine institution > of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; and in the doctrines of > grace substantially as they are set forth in the Thirty-Nine Articles of > Religion. > 2\\\\. This Church recognizes and adheres to Episcopacy, not as of Divine > right, but as a very ancient and desirable form of Church polity. > 3\\\\. This Church, retaining a liturgy which shall not be imperative or > repressive of freedom in prayer, accepts The Book of Common Prayer, as it > was revised, proposed, and recommended for use by the General Convention of > the Protestant Episcopal Church, A.D. 1785, reserving full liberty to alter, > abridge, enlarge, and amend the same, as may seem most conducive to the > edification of the people, \\"provided that the substance of the faith be kept > entire.\\" > 4\\\\. This Church condemns and rejects the following erroneous and strange > doctrines as contrary to God's Word: First, that the Church of Christ exists > only in one order or form of ecclesiastical polity; Second, that Christian > Ministers are \\"priests\\" in another sense than that in which all believers > are a \\"royal priesthood\\"; Third, that the Lord's Table is an altar on which > the oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ is offered anew to the Father; > Fourth, that the Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper is a presence in > the elements of Bread and Wine; Fifth, that regeneration is inseparably > connected with Baptism. Doctrine on Baptism The term regeneration has been used differently throughout the church's history, and the objection of the Reformed Episcopal Church's founders was based on the definition of the \\"new birth\\" then current amongst Evangelicals. If regeneration is an instantaneous work of the Spirit quickening the heart prior to conversion, a gift from God given only to His elect, then the language of baptismal regeneration would suggest that all the baptized are finally saved. It is for this reason that the Declaration of Principles denies that regeneration is inseparably connected with baptism. This of course has been an important issue for the REC since its founding. According to Guelzo, in his book, \\"For the Union of Evangelical Christendom\\" Cummins said, \\"the regeneration for which we thank God in baptism is not to be taken in any sense as descriptive of the renewing work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, but only a term equivalent to baptism, a sacramental change, a change of covenant relation.\\" Doctrine on ministry The Reformed Episcopal Church, according to its own Book of Common Prayer, holds that from Apostolic times, there have been three orders of ministry: Bishops, Presbyters and deacons. =Bishops= In a letter to a Protestant Episcopal cleric Bishop George Cummins wrote that the role of a bishop was an \\"office\\" of service not a \\"monarchialist order\\" contending that \\"the Episcopate is not of apostolic origin; that the Bishop is only primus inter pares, and not in any way superior in order to the Presbyter. We are acting on this principle. We set apart a Bishop to his work by a joint laying on of hands of a Bishop and the presbyters. I act as a Bishop, not claiming a jure divino right, or to be in any Apostolic Succession, but only as one chosen of his brethren to have the oversight. If others look upon me as retaining the succession, that does not commit us to their understanding.\\"Price, page 149. Emphasis in original. According to the church's early founders, bishops were \\"presiding presbyters, not diocesan Prelates\\".Price, page 133. Mason Gallagher, one founding minister, argued that the true episcopate had come through the 1785 line of evangelicals. In his view, the Protestant Episcopal Church had changed its principles and thereby lost any claim to valid episcopacy when it adopted the 1789 Book of Common Prayer containing a \\"Scoto-Romish Communion service and a thoroughly Sacerdotal Institution Office\\", and when it created a House of Bishops with power to overrule the existing House of presbyters and laymen: \\"If there is such a thing as the Historic Episcopate, and it is of any value, the parties making this offer in the present case cannot deliver the goods.\\" Bishops preside over Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry of the Church, \\"they are primarily the sign of unity in the church\\" =Ministers= At its founding in 1873, the REC designated its clergy as presbyters, pastors, and ministers, but not as \\"priests\\",Robert N. McIntyre ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Call Me Father‚Äù, A Biblical Perspective on the use of the term \\"father\\", Reformed Episcopal Church and the word \\"priest\\" was expunged from the REC's Book of Common Prayer in favor of the word \\"minister\\". This usage reflected the terminology used in the Cranmerian 1552 Book of Common Prayer. =Acceptance of other Evangelical clergy= REC ministers, like ministers of the Protestant Episcopal Church, exchanged pulpits with evangelical ministers of non- episcopal traditions. They viewed the ministries of the word and sacraments in other evangelical denominations as equally valid. True churches of Christ existed outside episcopal church structures, they held, contrary to Tractarian and High Church teaching. Inter-evangelical collegiality was an important issue for the REC, because Bishop Cummins had been censured for participation with Presbyterian and Methodist ministers in an inter-church communion service. This practice of the founders' praxis and belief has now been abandoned. The current praxis is to require reordination and regularization of orders if ordained outside episcopal ordination. At its first general council on December 2, 1873, the REC also reformed the transfer of clergy credentials from other denominations. In the Episcopal Church, such transfers had involved a process of application, examination, reception, and in some cases, conferral of holy orders, understood as a \\"regularization\\". In contrast, the REC allowed for examination in points of doctrine and discipline for validation of conformity yet without reordination. =Contemporary positions and controversies= Theological diversity Although the REC was founded as an evangelical and Reformed Anglican body, it now has Anglo-Catholics among its members and has entered into an intercommunion agreement with an Anglo- Catholic body, the APA. A 2006 document of the REC bishops, \\"True Unity by the Cross of Christ\\",True Unity by the Cross of Christ, 2006, Reformed Episcopal Church grants wider flexibility to re-interpret the Thirty-nine Articles in an Anglo-Catholic manner while maintaining the perspective of the English Reformers. It uses the terms \\"priest\\", \\"altar\\", and \\"Real Presence\\", and speaks of the authority of tradition as well as that of Holy Scripture. Reformed critics characterize these developments as rejecting the 35 Articles, revising the force of the Declaration of Principles, as well as departing from the Church's evangelical and Reformed heritage in order to accommodate Anglo- Catholicism.Dissimilitude in High Places, www.trecus.net Role of women in ministry The church does not ordain women as bishops, presbyters, or deacons. In 2002, the denomination approved a canon that provides for the \\"setting apart\\" of qualified women as deaconesses who are not considered by the church to be ordained. While they are not considered ordained they do have important functions within the ministry of the church. Canon 22 states, \\"The duty of the Deaconess is to assist the Minister in the care of the poor and sick, the religious training of the young and others, and the work of moral reformation.\\" Deaconesses in the Reformed Episcopal Church may have liturgical responsibilities; however they do not have eucharistic responsibilities beyond that allowed to any other member of the laity.See http://www.recdss.org/ \\"A Brief Apologia for Deaconesses\\", The Order of Deaconesses, Reformed Episcopal Church, as retrieved 23 December 2008. Some conservative Anglicans, especially those within the Continuing Anglican churches, have criticized the REC for uniting with the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) since certain ACNA dioceses ordain women to Holy Orders. While only a few dioceses ordain women to the priesthood, there are more that ordain women to the diaconate. Clergy transfers Under the current canons of the Reformed Episcopal Church, a non-REC minister entering into the REC ministry as a deacon or presbyter is to receive Holy Orders if he has not already been ordained by a bishop recognized by REC as in the historic succession. If previously ordained in a non-episcopal church, the applicant to the REC may need to be regularized. Book of Common Prayer =1873 edition= The founding First General Council of the REC approved a Book of Common Prayer for the church, with a text based on the proposed 1785 BCP prepared by William Smith and William White (later the first Episcopal Bishop of Pennsylvania).Bishop Charles Edward Cheyney, The Book of Common Prayer, Reformed Episcopal Church This text, Reprint from 1789 London edition includes REC Declaration of Principles and statement by Bp. Cummins. published in 1786, had been offered to the First General Convention at Philadelphia held in 1785.http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1786/BCP_1786.htm 1786 Proposed U. S. Book of Common Prayer Although initially authorized in some states, its changes met with considerable resistance, and the Episcopal Church adopted a different text in 1789 as its Book of Common Prayer.http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/hist_docs1.htm History of the American Prayer Book ‚Äì Illustrative documentshttp://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/mcgarvey1.htm History of the Prayer Book by William McGarvey In accord with prevailing Evangelical preferences and in opposition to Tractarianism, the 1873 REC Council made various changes in order \\"to eliminate from the Prayer-Book the germs of Romish error, which the compromises of the Elizabethan era have transmitted to us.\\" Cummins and other Evangelicals concerned about the influx of Anglo- Catholic Ritualism had been impressed by a tract, published by Frank S. Rising in 1868, entitled: \\"Are There Romanizing Germs in the Prayerbook?\\" The adoption of Bishop White's Book was an attempt to remove those portions of the BCP which were or could be made objectionable to the Evangelical conscience. The REC Book replaced the word \\"priest\\" with \\"minister\\" throughout, dropped saints' days from the calendar, and struck from the Apostles' Creed the words \\"He descended into hell\\". From the service of Holy Communion expressions such as \\"holy mysteries\\" and \\"eating the flesh and drinking the blood\\" were removed. References to baptismal regeneration were modified in accordance with evangelical views,Bishop Charles Edward Cheney Baptism and the Bible as were the services of Ordination and Marriage. In 1875, the Third General Council of the REC voted to append to the prayerbook 35 Articles of Religion (modelled after the original 39 Articles of the English prayerbook, but further defining the church in opposition to Ritualism). =Later editions= The REC Book of Common Prayer was updated in 1930 and 1963, and incorporated elements of the 1928 BCP of the Protestant Episcopal Church, while retaining the Evangelical distinctions of the REC. The Reformed Episcopal Church began a process of historical return, theological transformation and liturgical revision in the 1990s with the first revised BCP for trial use being produced in 1999. The 49th and 50th General Councils of the REC approved a revision of the Book of Common Prayer to be based on the 1662 Book, with elements drawn from several later Books (PECUSA 1928 and 1945, REC 1963, Australia 1978). The revised version was issued in 2003.Book of Common Prayer, 2003 Edition, 690 pages. with a subsequent update in 2005. Seminaries The Reformed Episcopal Church has three seminaries, operating at four sites. =Reformed Episcopal Seminary= The Theological Seminary of the Reformed Episcopal Church, otherwise known as Reformed Episcopal Seminary, is the largest and oldest of the seminaries of the Reformed Episcopal Church and is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. It began offering classes in 1886 in West Philadelphia and was chartered in 1887. Now located in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, it offers Master of Divinity (MDiv), a Certificate in Bible and Theology, and a Licentiate in Diaconal or Deaconess Ministry. The Reformed Episcopal Seminary has been at its current location for 17 years and recently acquired the building across the lot for additional classroom space and to house the book store. The new classroom space is being used for the language lab and some of the Old Testament Theology classes, the Bishop Nicholson classroom. The Main Campus building has also expanded classroom space this year by adding an additional classroom upstairs, the Bishop Rudolph classroom. Also, the library has been growing in volumes exponentially from generous donations. The expansive collection spans the main floor as well as the basement now. =Cummins Seminary= Cummins Memorial Theological Seminary, located in Summerville, South Carolina, near Charleston, is named for Bishop George Cummins, the founder of the Reformed Episcopal Church. The seminary which is conservative, evangelical, biblical and Anglican was founded in the latter part of the nineteenth century as a rogative college, meaning it was located wherever the Bishop of the Southeast took up residence. Colonel Stevens from the Citadel was the first bishop. The founding bishop was Bishop David Cummins. In 1912, the Diocese of the Southeast purchased a property for a permanent campus. Its motto is to \\"enter to learn and depart to serve\\". Its purpose is to equip generations of Church leaders for excellence in ministry and service with the theological foundation and skills to meet the spiritual, emotional and physical needs of communities through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The seminary offers residential programs leading to the degrees Bachelor of Theology and Master of Divinity, and the Certificate in Theological Studies. The Seminary formerly offered distance education through an External Studies Department. In 2016, Cummins President Dr. Julius Barnes appointed to the faculty the noted theologian John G. Panagiotou.Panagiotou joins Cummins Theological Seminary as lecturer http://www.journalscene.com/20160724/160729922/panagiotou-joins-cummins- theological-seminary-as-lecturer =Cranmer House= Cranmer Theological House was founded in 1994 in Shreveport, Louisiana, and is named for the English reformer, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. With courses offered in Katy, Texas, just west of Houston, as well as in Dallas, Cranmer House offers residential and distance learning programs for people not seeking ordination, a certificate in Anglican Studies, a Master of Arts in Religion (MAR), Master of Divinity (MDiv), and Master of Theology (ThM). A Deaconess Studies program was added to the 2009‚Äì2010 academic catalog. Bibliography * Acker, Keith J., Susanne Barrett, and Alice Acker.

Early life Born on April 14, 1912, Blake was drafted into the Army on December 23, 1943 at Fort McClellan in Anniston, Alabama. Despite his marriage after one year of attending high school, Blake also had previous experience in chauffeuring, truck, and tractor driving. He worked as a bus driver for Montgomery City Bus Lines until 1974. After he retired, he became a member of The Morningview Baptist Church. Rosa Parks First page of Parks' arrest report. Blake is listed as the complainant and warrant issuer. In 1955 Montgomery's black leaders were preparing to make a legal case against racial discrimination on the city bus system. Rosa Parks was selected to be the central figure in a challenge to the Jim Crow laws which supported segregation. Years before, in 1943, Parks had boarded a bus driven by Blake. She entered the front door of that bus and paid her fare‚Äîas she continued on to take a seat, Blake told her to disembark and enter the bus again from the back door, a rule imposed by some drivers. She got off and Blake drove off. She waited for the next bus, swearing to herself she would never ride with Blake again (though she forgot to check who was driving 12 years later). Blake and Parks encountered each other again on December 1, 1955, when Blake ordered Parks and three other black people to move to the back of his Cleveland Avenue bus (number 2857) in order to make room for a white passenger. By Parks' account, Blake said, \\"Y'all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats.\\" When she refused, Blake first contacted the bus company and called his boss remarking, \\"I called the company first, just like I was supposed to do,\\" Blake recalled in a later interview with the Washington Post. \\"I got my supervisor on the line. He said, 'Did you warn her, Jim?' I said, 'I warned her.' And he said, and I remember it just like I'm standing here, 'Well then, Jim, you do it, you got to exercise your powers and put her off, hear?' And that's just what I did.\\" Parks, after being arrested, was fined $10 and $4 in court fees. Later, Blake contacted the police and signed the warrant for her arrest (Chapter 6, Section 11, of the city code gave drivers police powers for the racial assignment of seats.) The arrest sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and led to Browder v. Gayle, the 1956 court case on the basis of which a United States District Court abolished segregation in transportation for the jurisdiction in which Montgomery, Alabama is located. Commenting on the event afterwards, Blake stated, \\"I wasn't trying to do anything to that Parks woman except do my job. She was in violation of the city codes, so what was I supposed to do? That damn bus was full and she wouldn't move back. I had my orders. I had police powers‚Äîany driver for the city did. So the bus filled up and a white man got on, and she had his seat and I told her to move back, and she wouldn't do it.\\" Death Blake continued working at the bus company (the Montgomery City Lines became the Montgomery Area Transit System in 1974) for another 19 years. He died of a heart attack in his Montgomery home in 2002, less than a month before his 90th birthday. He and his wife had been married for 68 years. Commenting on his death, Parks said, \\"I'm sure his family will miss him.\\" See also * Claudette Colvin ‚Äì preceded Parks in an earlier attempt to challenge the bus segregation laws References Category:1912 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Montgomery bus boycott Category:Military personnel from Montgomery, Alabama Category:History of Montgomery, Alabama Category:Bus drivers Category:United States Army soldiers ","title":"James F.

This and related ferrite materials are components in magnetic stripe cards and loudspeaker magnets. BaFe is described as Ba2+(Fe3+)12(O2‚àí)19. The Fe3+ centers are ferromagnetically coupled. This area of technology is usually considered to be an application of the related fields of materials science and solid state chemistry. Barium ferrite is a highly magnetic material, has a high packing density, and is a metal oxide. Studies of this material date at least as far back as 1931, and it has found applications in magnetic card strips, speakers, and magnetic tapes. One area in particular it has found success in is long-term data storage; the material is magnetic, resistant to temperature change, corrosion and oxidization. Chemical structure The Fe3+ centers, with a high-spin d5 configuration, are ferromagnetically coupled. This area of technology is usually considered to be an application of the related fields of materials science and solid state chemistry. A related family of industrially useful \\"hexagonal ferrites\\" are known, also containing barium. In contrast to the usual spinel structure, these materials feature hexagonal close-packed framework of oxides. Furthermore, some of the oxygen centers are replaced by Ba2+ ions. Formulas for these species include BaFe12O19, BaFe15O23, and BaFe18O27. A one-step hydrothermal process can be used to form crystals of barium ferrite, by mixing barium chloride, ferrous chloride, potassium nitrate, and sodium hydroxide with a hydroxide to chloride concentration ratio of 2:1. Nano-particles are prepared from ferric nitrate, barium chloride, sodium citrate, and sodium hydroxide. The typical preparation, however, is by calcining barium carbonate with iron(III) oxide: :BaCO3 \\\\+ 6 Fe2O3 ->[\\\\text{Œî}] BaFe12O19 \\\\+ CO2 Properties Barium ferrite has been considered for long term data storage. The material has proven to be resistant to a number of different environmental stresses, including humidity and corrosion. Because ferrites are already oxidized it can not be oxidized any further. This is one reason ferrites are so resistant to corrosion. Barium ferrite also proved to be resistant to thermal demagnetization, another issue common with long term storage. The Curie temperature is typically around 450 C (723 K). When barium ferrite magnets increase in temperature, their high intrinsic coercivity improves, this is what makes it more resistant to thermal demagnetization. Ferrite magnets are the only type of magnets that become substantially more resistant to demagnetization as temperature increases. This characteristic of barium ferrite makes it a popular choice in motor and generator designs and also in loudspeaker applications. Ferrite magnets can be used in temperatures up to 300 ¬∞C, which makes it a perfect to be used in the applications mentioned above. Ferrite magnets are extremely good insulators and don't allow any electrical current to flow through them and they are brittle which shows their ceramic characteristics. Ferrite magnets also have good machining properties, which allows for the material to be cut in many shapes and sizes. =Chemical properties= Barium ferrites are robust ceramics that are generally stable to moisture and corrosion-resistant. BaFe is also an oxide so it does not break down due to oxidation as much as a metal alloy might; giving BaFe a much greater life expectancy. =Mechanical properties= Metal particles (MP) have been used to store data on tapes and magnetic strips but they have reached their limit for high capacity data storage. In order to increase their capacity by (25x) on data tape the MP had to increase the tape length by (45%) and track density by over (500%) which made it necessary to reduce the size of the individual particles. As the particles were reduced in size, the passivizing coating needed to prevent the oxidation and deterioration of the MP had to become thicker. This presented a problem for as the passivation coating got thicker it became harder to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio. Barium ferrite completely out classes MP, mostly because BaFe is already in its oxidized state and so is not restricted in its size by a protective coating. Also due to its hexagonal pattern it is easier to organize compared to the unorganized rod like MP. Another factor is the difference in the size of the particles, in MP the size ranges from 40-100 nm while the BaFe is only 20 nm. So the smallest MP particle is still double the size of the BaFe particles. Applications  Barium Ferrite is used in tape drives and floppy disks. Barium ferrite is used in applications such as recording media, permanent magnets, and magnetic stripe cards (credit cards, hotel keys, ID cards). Due to the stability of the material, it is able to be greatly reduced in size, making the packing density much greater. Earlier media devices utilized doped acicular oxide materials to yield the coercivity values necessary to record. In recent decades, barium ferrite has replaced acicular oxides; without any dopants, the acicular oxides produce very low coercivity values, making the material very magnetically soft, while barium ferrite's higher coercivity levels make the material magnetically hard and thus a superior choice for recording material applications. = Magnetic Stripes = ID cards using barium ferrite are made with a magnetic fingerprint that identifies them, allowing readers to self-calibrate. =Speaker magnets= Barium ferrite is a common material for speaker magnets. The materials can be formed into almost any shape and size using a process called sintering, whereby powdered barium ferrite is pressed into a mold, and then heated until it fuses together. The barium ferrite turns into a solid block while still retaining its magnetic properties. The magnets have an excellent resistance to demagnetization, allowing them to still be useful in speaker units over a long period of time. =Linear Tape-Open= Barium ferrite is used for Linear Tape-Open (LTO) storage. Barium ferrite might lead to future improvements in LTO tapes because of its high data density. Developments in the field have also resulted in the reduction of the size of BaFe particles to about 20 nm. This contrasts with MP technology, which is considered less promising because of problems shrinking the particles past 100 nm. The shape is another factor. Metal particles are often cylindrical shapes that do not pack or stack well. Barium ferrite has better packing properties. BaFe can be reduced to a smaller size and higher packing density because of its circular structure and can be stacked better.

First Direct has headquarters in Leeds, England, and has 1.45 million customers.https://www1.firstdirect.com/press-releases/about-first-direct/ It was awarded Most Trusted Financial Provider by Moneywise in 2019, and was ranked top in the February 2020 Competition and Markets Authority bi-annual survey for overall service quality. History Stourton, Leeds. First Direct was formed on 1 October 1989 by Midland Bank, one of the 'big four' banks in the United Kingdom. It became a part of HSBC in June 1992, when that business acquired Midland Bank. First Direct took its first call on 12:01am on 1 October 1989; more than 1,000 calls were taken within the first twenty four hours. The launch of First Direct in 1989 was advertised twofold. Firstly, there was an advert for Audi which was interrupted by a broadcast purportedly back in time from 2010, celebrating the 21st anniversary of the company (the interruption was agreed with Audi beforehand). Secondly, there were two different adverts running concurrently on ITV and Channel 4, one offering a negative view showing the aspects of normal banking and the other a positive view of First Direct, with the two crossing over at a key point.HHCL By May 1991, the bank had 100,000 customers on its books, and by March 1993, it had 250,000. It first achieved break even in December 1994. In April 1995, the bank gained its 500,000th customer. In May 1999, it launched text message (SMS) banking, a service through which the bank alerts customers by SMS if the balance on their current account goes below a certain amount, and, if set, will send weekly mini statements also by SMS. The bank began limited trials of internet banking in July 1997, launching the service fully in August 2000. In July 2001, the bank's Offset Mortgage was launched. In January 2004, the bank launched First Directory, a service whereby additional services were added to current accounts such as free text message banking, annual travel insurance and mobile phone insurance for a fixed monthly charge. In April 2004, the bank launched Internet Banking Plus, a service whereby account information was taken by third party internet banking from the bank's other accounts with different banks and the information was unified under First Direct's Internet Banking Plus service. In October 2006, the bank launched a first generation mobile phone banking service in partnership with Monilink, pre dating mobile apps. In February 2007, First Direct became the first bank in the United Kingdom to introduce a fee for basic financial transactions, fuelling concern for the future of fee free banking in the country for personal customers. The bank sponsors the First Direct Arena. In May 2013, First Direct secured naming rights until 2018 for the new Leeds Arena, to be known as the First Direct Arena. In March 2017, it was announced that First Direct had extended its naming sponsorship of Leeds arena for a further five years. In September 2016, First Direct introduced voice ID technology to verify customers' identities when calling into the bank, the first bank in the United Kingdom to introduce the technology on such a large scale. The following year saw the introduction of a new native mobile app, for both Apple and Android platforms. In July 2018, First Direct transferred from being a division of HSBC Bank plc to a division of HSBC UK Bank plc, as part of the bank's ringfencing restructure.

Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, p. xiv also known as Darul Islam/Islamic Armed Forces of Indonesia (, DI/TII), was an Islamist group that fought for the establishment of an Islamic state in Indonesia. It was established in 1942 by a group of Muslim militias, coordinated by a charismatic radical Muslim politician, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosoewirjo. The group recognised only Shari'a as a valid source of law. The movement has produced splinters and offshoots that range from Jemaah Islamiyah to non-violent religious groups.  Establishment  During the Indonesian National Revolution, Kartosoewirjo founded his own band of fighters in West Java, called Hizbullah and Sabilillah. As a protest toward the Renville Agreement signed by Indonesian leaders in 1948, which ceded West Java to the Dutch, Kartosoewirjo proclaimed a Darul Islam (meaning \\"Islamic State\\") in West Java on 7 August 1949. Darul Islam did not disband itself after the transfer of sovereignty in 1949, resulting in a clash with the government of the Indonesian Republic. Rebels in South Sulawesi led by army deserter Abdul Kahar Muzakkar joined the Darul Islam Movement in 1951. On 20 September 1953, Daud Beureu'eh declared that Aceh was part of the Islamic State of Indonesia (Negara Islam Indonesia) under the leadership of Kartosoewirjo. The movement flourished in the 1950s due to chronic instability within the central government during the Liberal Democracy Era. In 1957, it was estimated that the Darul Islam controlled one-third of West Java and more than 90% of South Sulawesi and Aceh provinces where the government only controlled the cities and towns. The movement had 15,000 armed guerillas operating under the banner of Tentara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic Army). In that year, Darul Islam agents unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Sukarno by throwing grenades at him during a school function in Cikini, Central Jakarta.

Smaller Darul Islam bands operating in Central Java under Amir Fatah were crushed by Colonel Ahmad Yani's Banteng Raiders in 1954‚Äì1957. Darul Islam forces in South Kalimantan under Ibnu Hadjar were forced to surrender in 1959. Amir Fatah was killed in 1954, while Ibnu Hadjar was eventually executed in 1962. Three years of negotiations (1959‚Äì1962) led to a peace agreement that ended the conflict in Aceh, in which Aceh was restored as an autonomous province with special rights for Islamic law. Introduction of effective \\"fence-of-legs\\" method of encircling rebel mountain hideouts in 1959 succeeded in breaking the strong rebel grip over West Java's rural areas. On June 1962, Kartosoewirjo was captured on his hideout of Mount Geber near Garut. In captivity, Kartosoewirjo issued order for all his followers to surrender, after which he was quickly tried and executed. The last Darul Islam band in West Java surrendered on August 1962. Successive military operations also crushed the Darul Islam in South Sulawesi. On February 1965, its leader Kahar Muzakkar was killed in a military ambush in the interior of Southeast Sulawesi province, ending the Darul Islam insurgency in Indonesia. However, despite the group being dismantled, underground networks have persisted. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were occurrences of 'Islamic' terrorism attributed to a group known as Komando Jihad. The leaders arrested from this group were found to be Darul Islam veterans.

British Library Add MS 37777 The Ceolfrid Bible (London, British Library, Add MS 45025) is a fragment of a late 7th or early 8th century Bible. It is almost certainly a portion of one of the three single-volume Bibles ordered made by Ceolfrid, Abbot of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. It is closely related to the Codex Amiatinus, which is the only surviving complete Bible of the three ordered by Ceolfrid. The eleven surviving vellum leaves of the manuscript contain portions of the Latin Vulgate text of the third and fourth Books of Kings. Except for folio 11, which is missing a strip at the bottom of the leaf, the leaves are 430mm by 340mm. The text is written in two columns of 44 lines in an uncial hand. The script and the text both bear a remarkable similarity with the Codex Amiatinus, although there are some corrections in the Ceolfrid Bible not in the Codex Amiatinus. The text is arranged \\"per cola et commata\\", that is, the length of a line serves to clarify the sense of the text. The text is divided identically as the text of the Codex Amiatinus. The first lines of each chapter are written with red ink. The beginning of the Fourth Book of Kings is marked by an enlarged initial P decorated with red dots. In the margin next to the initial P there is a Chi Rho monogram flanked by the Greek letters Alpha and Omega. Punctuation was added to the text at a later date. In the 14th century modern chapter numbers were added along with a note between the end of the Third Book of Kings and the Beginning of the Fourth Book of Kings which reads Explicit Regum liber tercius. Incipit quartus. Prevaricatus est etc. An additional single leaf, now in the British Library (Add MS 37777) contains another portion of the Third Book of Kings and shares all of the similarities shared by the Ceolfrid Bible and the Codex Amiatinus. This leaf almost certainly is either also from the Ceolfrid Bible or from the third Bible ordered made by Ceolfrid. The leaves of the Ceolfrid Bible were used in the 16th century as covers for the Chartulary of the lands of the Willoughby family. They were afterwards preserved at Wollaton Hall in Nottinghamshire. Add MS 37777 was discovered by Rev. William Greenwell in Newcastle. A third leaf was found in 1982 at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust property near Wimborne Minster in Dorset. This leaf, which came from Ecclesiasticus III-IV, had been used as a covering for documents which had also come from the Willoughby family of Wollaton.N.

It was originally introduced into Latin to transliterate Greek loan words. In modern languages that use the Latin alphabet, it represents a number of different sounds. It is the most common digraph in order of frequency in the English language. Cluster /t.h/ A. B. Frost's first comic: a German attempts to pronounce English-language \\"th\\" sounds The most logical use of is to represent a consonant cluster of the phonemes /t/ and /h/, as in English knighthood. This is not a digraph, since a digraph is a pair of letters representing a single phoneme or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the separate characters. Aspirated stop /t ∞/ The digraph was first introduced in Latin to transliterate the letter theta in loans from Greek. Theta was pronounced as an aspirated stop in Classical and early Koine Greek. is used in academic transcription systems to represent letters in south and east Asian alphabets that have the value . According to the Royal Thai General System of Transcription, for example, represents a series of Thai letters with the value . is also used to transcribe the phoneme in Southern Bantu languages, such as Zulu and Tswana. Voiceless fricative /Œ∏/ During late antiquity, the Greek phoneme represented by the letter mutated from an aspirated stop to a fricative . This mutation affected the pronunciation of , which began to be used to represent the phoneme in some of the languages that had it. One of the earliest languages to use the digraph this way was Old High German, before the final phase of the High German consonant shift, in which and came to be pronounced . The Old English Latin alphabet adapted the runic letter (thorn), as well as (eth; in Old English), a modified version of the Latin letter , to represent this sound, but the digraph gradually superseded these letters in Middle English. However, in early Old English of the 7th and 8th centuries, the runic letters were initially not used yet and the digraph used in its place. In modern English, an example of the digraph pronounced as is the one in tooth. In Old and Middle Irish, was used for as well, but the sound eventually changed into (see below). Other languages that use for include Albanian and Welsh, both of which treat it as a distinct letter and alphabetize it between and . Voiced fricative /√∞/ English also uses to represent the voiced dental fricative , as in father. This unusual extension of the digraph to represent a voiced sound is caused by the fact that, in Old English, the sounds /Œ∏/ and /√∞/ stood in allophonic relationship to each other and so did not need to be rigorously distinguished in spelling. The letters and were used indiscriminately for both sounds, and when these were replaced by in the 15th century, it was likewise used for both sounds. (For the same reason, is used in English for both and .) In the Norman dialect J√®rriais, the French phoneme is realized as , and is spelled under the influence of English. Voiceless retroflex stop / à/ In the Latin alphabet for the Javanese language, is used to transcribe the phoneme voiceless retroflex stop , which is written as Í¶õ in the native Javanese script. Alveolar stop /t/ Because neither nor were native phonemes in Latin, the Greek sound represented by came to be pronounced . The spelling retained the digraph for etymological reasons. This practice was then borrowed into German, French, Dutch and other languages, where still appears in originally Greek words, but is pronounced . See German orthography. Interlingua also employs this pronunciation. In early modern times, French, German and English all expanded this by analogy to words for which there is no etymological reason, but for the most part the modern spelling systems have eliminated this. Examples of unetymological in English are the name of the River Thames from Middle English Temese and the name Anthony (though the is often pronounced under the influence of the spelling) from Latin Antonius. In English, for can also occur in loan-words from French or German, such as Neanderthal. The English name Thomas has initial because it was loaned from Norman. Dental stop /tÃ™/ In the transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages represents a dental stop, . /h/ In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, represents the lenition of . In most cases word- initially, it is pronounced . For example: Irish and Scottish Gaelic toil 'will' ‚Üí do thoil 'your will'. This use of digraphs with to indicate lenition is distinct from the other uses which derive from Latin. While it is true that the presence of digraphs with in Latin inspired the Goidelic usage, their allocation to phonemes is based entirely on the internal logic of the Goidelic languages. Lenition in Gaelic lettering was traditionally denoted in handwriting using an overdot but typesetters lacked these pre-composed types and substituted a trailing h. It is also a consequence of their history: the digraph initially, in Old and Middle Irish, designated the phoneme , but later sound changes complicated and obscured the grapheme‚Äìsound correspondence, so that is even found in some words like Scottish Gaelic piuthar \\"sister\\" that never had a to begin with. This is an example of \\"inverted (historical) spelling\\": the model of words where the original interdental fricative had disappeared between vowels caused to be reinterpreted as a marker of hiatus. √ò The Irish and Scottish Gaelic lenited /t/ is silent in final position, as in Scottish Gaelic sgith \\"tired\\". And, rarely, it is silent in initial position, as in Scottish Gaelic thu \\"you\\".

Biography  Tran was born in Nha Trang, Vietnam. After moving to the United States in 1982, Tran found work in the electronics industry in Silicon Valley. She began playing poker in 1989, after an auto accident left her disabled and unable to continue working in her field. Tran has finished in the money in multiple World Series of Poker (WSOP) tournaments, including two second-place finishes, a third-place finish and a fourth-place finish. A high-stakes specialist, Tran is perhaps best known as Barry Greenstein's ex-girlfriend. Greenstein not only taught her how to play poker, but also convinced her to compete in tournaments; until the mid-to-late 1990s she had been exclusively a side-game player. (Initially, Greenstein himself also played exclusively in side-games; he used to donate his tournament winnings to charity.) In exchange for Greenstein teaching Tran how to play poker, she taught him how to speak Vietnamese. The two have an ongoing debate about who is the better teacher; Greenstein says he is the better teacher and Tran says that is only because she is the better student. As of 2008, her total live tournament winnings exceed $1,400,000. Her 17 cashes at the WSOP account for $408,304 of those winnings.World Series of Poker Earnings , worldseriesofpoker.com She also features highly in the list of most successful female poker players in terms of tournament earnings. Tran has two children and lives in Los Angeles, California. At the inaugural National Heads-Up Poker Championship, Tran was the only female to make the money in a field that included Annie Duke, Jennifer Harman, Kathy Liebert, Cyndy Violette and Evelyn Ng. All three of her opponents were WSOP Main Event champions: she defeated 1983 champion Tom McEvoy and 2003 champion Chris Moneymaker before being eliminated in the semi-finals by 2000 champion Chris Ferguson. She received $25,000 prize money.

In humans, the tooth-bearing bones are the maxilla and the mandible.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 219 The curved part of each alveolar process on the jaw is called the alveolar arch. Structure On the maxilla, the alveolar process is a ridge on the inferior surface, and on the mandible it is a ridge on the superior surface. It makes up the thickest part of the maxillae. The alveolar process contains a region of compact bone adjacent to the periodontal ligament (PDL), called the lamina dura when viewed on radiographs. It is this part which is attached to the cementum of the roots by the periodontal ligament. It is uniformly radiopaque (or lighter). Integrity of the lamina dura is important when studying radiographs for pathological lesions. The alveolar process has a supporting bone, both of which have the same components: fibers, cells, intercellular substances, nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics. The alveolar process is the lining of the tooth socket or alveolus (plural, alveoli). Although the alveolar process is composed of compact bone, it may be called the cribriform plate because it contains numerous holes where Volkmann canals pass from the alveolar bone into the PDL. The alveolar bone proper is also called bundle bone because Sharpey fibers, a part of the fibers of the PDL, are inserted here. Similar to those of the cemental surface, Sharpey fibers in alveolar bone proper are each inserted at 90 degrees, or at a right angle, but are fewer in number, although thicker in diameter than those present in cementum. As in cellular cementum, Sharpey fibers in bone are generally mineralized only partially at their periphery. The alveolar crest is the most cervical rim of the alveolar bone proper. In a healthy situation, the alveolar crest is slightly apical to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) by approximately 1.5 to 2 mm. The alveolar crests of neighboring teeth are also uniform in height along the jaw in healthy situation.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 176 The supporting alveolar bone consists of both cortical bone and trabecular bone. The cortical bone, or cortical plates, consists of plates of compact bone on the facial and lingual surfaces of the alveolar bone. These cortical plates are usually about 1.5 to 3 mm thick over posterior teeth, but the thickness is highly variable around anterior teeth. The trabecular bone consists of cancellous bone that is located between the alveolar bone proper and the plates of cortical bone. The alveolar bone between two neighboring teeth is the interdental septum (or interdental bone). Composition Inorganic matrix Alveolar bone is 67% inorganic material by weight. The inorganic material is composed mainly of the minerals calcium and phosphate. The mineral content is mostly in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals. Organic matrix The remaining alveolar bone is organic material (33%). The organic material consists of collagen and non- collagenous material. The cellular component of bone consists of osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. * Osteoblasts are usually cuboidal and slightly elongated in shape. They synthesise both collagenous ad non-collagenous bone proteins. These cells have a high level of alkaline phosphatase on the outer surface of their plasma membrane. The functions of osteoblasts are bone formation by synthesising the organic matrix of bone, cell to cell communication and maintenance of bone matrix. * Osteocytes are modified osteoblasts which become entrapped in lacunae during the secretion of bone matrix. The osteocytes have processes called canaliculi that radiate from the lacunae. These canaliculi bring oxygen and nutrients to the osteocytes through blood and remove metabolic waste products. * Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells. They are found in Howship‚Äôs lacunae. Clinical significance =Alveolar bone loss= Bone is lost through the process of resorption which involves osteoclasts breaking down the hard tissue of bone. A key indication of resorption is when scalloped erosion occurs. This is also known as Howship‚Äôs lacuna. The resorption phase lasts as long as the lifespan of the osteoclast which is around 8 to 10 days. After this resorption phase, the osteoclast can continue resorbing surfaces in another cycle or carry out apoptosis. A repair phase follows the resorption phase which lasts over 3 months. In patients with periodontal disease, inflammation lasts longer and during the repair phase, resorption may override any bone formation. This results in a net loss of alveolar bone. Alveolar bone loss is closely associated with periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is the inflammation of the gums. Studies in osteoimmunology have proposed 2 models for alveolar bone loss. One model states that inflammation is triggered by a periodontal pathogen which activates the acquired immune system to inhibit bone coupling by limiting new bone formation after resorption. Another model states that cytokinesis may inhibit the differentiation of osteoblasts from their precursors, therefore limiting bone formation. This results in a net loss of alveolar bone. =Developmental disturbances= The developmental disturbance of anodontia (or hypodontia, if only one tooth), in which tooth germs are congenitally absent, may affect the development of the alveolar processes. This occurrence can prevent the alveolar processes of either the maxillae or the mandible from developing. Proper development is impossible because the alveolar unit of each dental arch must form in response to the tooth germs in the area. =Pathology= After extraction of a tooth, the clot in the alveolus fills in with immature bone, which later is remodeled into mature secondary bone. Disturbance of the blood clot can cause alveolar osteitis, commonly referred to as \\"dry socket.\\" With the partial or total loss of teeth, the alveolar process undergoes resorption. The underlying basal bone of the body of the maxilla or mandible remains less affected, however, because it does not need the presence of teeth to remain viable. The loss of alveolar bone, coupled with attrition of the teeth, causes a loss of height of the lower third of the vertical dimension of the face when the teeth are in maximum intercuspation. The extent of this loss is determined based on clinical judgment using the Golden Proportions. The density of the alveolar bone in a given area also determines the route that dental infection takes with abscess formation, as well as the efficacy of local infiltration during the use of local anesthesia. In addition, the differences in alveolar process density determine the easiest and most convenient areas of bony fracture to be used, if needed during tooth extraction of impacted teeth. During chronic periodontal disease that has affected the periodontium (periodontitis), localized bone tissue is also lost. = Alveolar bone grafting = Alveolar bone grafting in the mixed dentition is an essential part of the reconstructive journey for cleft lip and palate patients. The reconstruction of the alveolar cleft can provide both aesthetic and practical advantages to the patient. Alveolar bone grafting can also bring about the following benefits: stabilisation of the maxillary arch; aid of eruption of the canine and sometimes lateral incisor eruption; offering bony support to the teeth lying next to the cleft; elevate the alar base of the nose; aid sealing of oro-nasal fistula; permit insertion of a titanium fixture in the grafted region and achieve good periodontal conditions within and next to the cleft. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons License. The timing of the alveolar bone grafting takes into consideration both eruption of the canine and lateral incisor. The optimal time for bone grafting surgery is when a thin shell of bone still covers the soon erupting lateral incisor or canine tooth close to the cleft. * Primary bone grafting: Primary bone grafting is believed to: eliminate bone deficiency, stabilize pre-maxilla, synthesize new bone matrix for eruption of teeth in the cleft area and augment the alar base. However, the early bone grafting procedure is abandoned in most cleft lip and palate centres around the world due to many disadvantages, including serious growth disturbances of the middle third of the facial skeleton. The operative technique that involves the vomero-premaxillary suture was found to inhibit maxillary growth. * Secondary bone grafting: Secondary bone grafting, also referred to as bone grafting in the mixed dentition, became a well-established procedure after abandoning primary bone grafting. The pre-requisites include precise timing, operating technique, and acceptably vascularized soft tissue. The advantages of primary bone grafting, which are allowing tooth eruption through the grafted bone, are retained. Furthermore, secondary bone grafting stabilizes the maxillary arch, thus enhancing the conditions for prosthodontic treatment such as crowns, bridges and implants. It also aids eruption of teeth, boosting the amount of bony tissue on the alveolar crest, permitting orthodontic treatment. Bony support to teeth adjacent to the cleft is a pre-requisite for orthodontic closure of the teeth in the cleft region. Hence, better hygienic conditions will be achieved which helps to lessen formation of caries and periodontal inflammation. Speech problems caused by irregular positioning of articulators, or leakage of air via the oronasal communication, may also be improved. Secondary bone grafting can also be used to augment the alar base of the nose to achieve symmetry with the non-cleft side, thereby enhancing facial appearance. * Late secondary bone grafting: Bone grafting has a lower success rate when performed after canine has erupted as compared to before the eruption. It has been found that the possibility for orthodontic closure of the cleft in the dental arch is smaller in patients grafted before canine eruption than those after the canine eruption. The surgical procedure includes drilling of several small openings through the cortical layer into the cancellous layer, facilitating growth of blood vessels into the graft.

Official website of the Tricare Management Activity Tricare provides civilian health benefits for U.S Armed Forces military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents, including some members of the Reserve Component. Tricare is the civilian care component of the Military Health System, although historically it also included health care delivered in military medical treatment facilities. The Tricare program is managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). Before 1 October 2013, it was managed by the Tricare Management Activity (TMA) under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). On that date, TMA was disestablished and Tricare responsibility was transferred to the newly established DHA.Defense Health Agency - About TMA The Department of Defense operates a health care delivery system served approximately 9.4 million beneficiaries in 2018. The Department of Defense's unified medical program represents $50.6 billion or 8% of total FY2019 U.S. military spending. With the exception of active duty service members (who are assigned to the TRICARE Prime option and pay no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE coverage), Military Health System beneficiaries may have a choice of TRICARE plan options depending upon their status (e.g., active duty family member, retiree, reservist, child under age 26 ineligible for family coverage, Medicare-eligible, etc.) and geographic location. History Historically, health care for military personnel and their dependents was provided in military medical facilities as promised by the military, and through a referral system, by civilian medical personnel where military physicians were not available in a certain specialty, or when and where overcrowding of a military medical facility occurred. Active duty military personnel always have priority for care in military medical facilities. After World War II and the Korean War, especially with the growth in the standing forces of the U.S. military due to the Cold War, access to care in military facilities became increasingly unavailable for military retirees and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel due to resource constraints and growing demands on the system. It was at this time that the concept of \\"space-available basis\\" for military retirees and military dependents was first noted. To address this problem, Congress passed the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 and the Military Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966. These acts allowed the Secretary of Defense to contract with civilian health care providers. This civilian health care program became known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) in 1966. In the late 1980s, because of escalating costs, paperwork demands, and general beneficiary dissatisfaction, DoD initiated a series of demonstration projects. Under a program known as the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI), a contractor provided both health care and administrative-related services, including claims processing. The CRI project was one of the first to introduce managed care features to the CHAMPUS program. Beneficiaries under CRI were offered three choices ‚Äì a health maintenance organization-like option called Tricare (CHAMPUS) Prime that required enrollment and offered enhanced benefits and low-cost shares, a preferred provider organization-like option called Tricare (CHAMPUS) Extra that required use of network providers in exchange for lower cost shares, and the standard CHAMPUS option that continued the freedom of choice in selecting providers but required higher cost shares and deductibles known as Tricare Standard. Although DOD's initial intent under CRI was to award three competitively bid contracts covering six states, only one bid, made by Foundation Health Corporation (now Health Net) covering California and Hawaii, was received. Foundation delivered services under this contract between August 1988 and January 1994. In late 1993, in response to requirements in the DOD Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1994, the DoD announced plans for implementing a nationwide managed care program for the MHS that would be completely implemented by May 1997. Under this program, known as Tricare, the United States was divided into 12 health care regions. An administrative organization, the lead agent, was designated for each region and coordinated the health care needs of all military treatment facilities in the region. Under Tricare, seven managed care support contracts were awarded covering DOD's 12 health care regions. Since then, Tricare has undergone several restructuring initiatives, including re-alignment of contract regions, Base Realignment and Closure, and the addition of \\"Tricare for Life\\" benefits in 2001 for those who are Medicare-eligible, and \\"Tricare Reserve Select\\" in 2005. Tricare's options =Tricare Select= Tricare Select provides a similar benefit to the original CHAMPUS program and is available to retirees from the Active Component, retirees from the Reserve Component age 60 or older, and their eligible family members. Tricare Select is also available to Reservist and their family under the Tricare Reserve Select Component. Under Tricare Select, beneficiaries can use any civilian health care provider that is payable under Tricare regulations. The beneficiary is responsible for payment of an annual deductible and coinsurance, and may be responsible for certain other out-of-pocket expenses. There is no enrollment fee for Tricare Select. =Tricare Extra= Tricare Standard beneficiaries can elect to use the Tricare Extra option by using a civilian health care provider from within the regional contractor's provider network. In this way, Tricare Extra represents a preferred provider organization (PPO). When using Tricare Extra, the beneficiary's coinsurance amount is reduced by at least five percentage points. There is no fee for use of the Tricare Extra benefit other than the coinsurance. This Plan was Discontinued on 1/1/2018 =Tricare Prime= Tricare Prime is a health maintenance organization (HMO) style plan available to active duty personnel, retirees from the Active Component, retirees from the Reserve Component age 60 or older, and their eligible family members. Under Tricare Prime, beneficiaries must choose a primary care physician and obtain referrals and authorizations for specialty care. In return for these restrictions, beneficiaries are responsible only for small copayments for each visit (retirees and their families only). There is an annual enrollment fee for Tricare Prime for military retirees and their family members. There is no enrollment fee for active duty military and their family members. The majority of Tricare PRIME enrollees must exclusively use the MTF (Military Treatment Facility) to receive their care, as long as the MTF has capacity. If the MTF does not have capacity, the commander of the MTF notifies the region's contractor and the contractor's provider network is used to supplement the MTF's capacity. If the MTF regains capacity, the MTF reserves the right to move the beneficiaries back to receiving their care at the MTF in a process known as \\"recapture.\\" US Family Health Plan US Family Health Plan, a Tricare Prime-sponsored health plan option, is made available by nonprofit health care providers in the Northeast U.S., Southeast Texas/Southwest Louisiana, and the Puget Sound region of Washington state. =Tricare Reserve Select (TRS)= Tricare Reserve Select is a premium-based health plan that active status qualified National Guard and Reserve members may purchase. The classification is sometimes referred to as Tricare Reserve Component (RC). It requires a monthly premium and offers coverage similar to Tricare Standard and Extra for the military member and eligible family members. It has a partial premium cost sharing arrangement with DoD similar to civilian private or public sector employer plans, although typically at a lower cost than civilian plans. The program coverage is available worldwide to Selected Reserve (SELRES) members of both the Title 10 USC Federal Reserve Components (Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve), Title 14 USC Federal Reserve Component (Coast Guard Reserve) and the Title 32 National Guard (Army National Guard and Air National Guard) in a drill pay (also known as \\"paid\\") status. As of February 2008, retired Reserve Component personnel under the age of 60, actively drilling Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) personnel in a non-paid status, or actively drilling Volunteer Training Unit (VTU) personnel in a non-paid status do not qualify for TRS. IRR and VTU members are eligible for reinstatement under TRS is they return to a SELRES status. Reserve Component personnel who are also Federal civil servants (to include Army Reserve Technicians and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) in the Army Reserve, Army National Guard, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard) and eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) are also excluded from TRS. Retired Reserve Component personnel and eligible dependent family members become eligible Tricare Standard, Tricare Extra or Tricare Prime on the service member's 60th birthday in the same manner as Active Component retirees and their eligible dependents are eligible immediately upon retirement from active service. Qualification questions should be referred to Tricare. =Tricare Reserve Retired (TRR)= Tricare Reserve Retired is a premium-based health plan that qualified retired members of the National Guard and Reserve under the age of 60 may purchase for themselves and eligible family members. Established in 2008 and opened for enrollment in 2010, it is similar to Tricare Reserve Select (TRS), but differs in that there is no premium cost-sharing with DoD as there is with TRS. As such, retired Reserve Component members who elect to purchase TRR must pay the full cost (100%) of the calculated premium plus an additional administrative fee. Payments could range as high as $900.00 a month. Although open to all eligible retired Reserve Component personnel under the age of 60, the program's principal focus is often perceived as being focused on recent Reserve Component retirees who are self-employed or otherwise ineligible for civilian employer provided/subsidized health insurance, especially those who were mobilized for full-time active duty service subsequent to 11 September 2001 in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn and/or Noble Eagle. Retired Reserve Component personnel who elect to participate in TRR will exit TRR when the service member reaches age 60 and he/she and their eligible dependent family members become eligible for the same Tricare Standard, Tricare Extra or Tricare Prime options as Active Component retirees and, in the case of Tricare Prime, at the same cost as Active Component retirees. Qualification questions should be referred to Tricare. =Tricare for Life (TFL)= Tricare for Life was first incorporated as part of the then-seven regional Managed Care Support Contracts of Tricare in May 2001. The benefit was enacted by Congress in response to growing complaints from beneficiaries that as Medicare out of pocket costs increased a benefit was needed to pay these costs in lieu of Tricare retirees being required to purchase Medicare Supplemental Coverage to pay for prescriptions, physician and hospital dispensed drugs, cost shares and deductibles. Before Tricare for Life, Tricare beneficiaries immediately lost Tricare coverage upon attaining Medicare eligibility at age 65, placing them at the same level of coverage as U.S. citizens who had never served full 20 to 30-plus year careers in the armed forces. This included becoming Medicare eligible due to disability. Tricare for Life is designed to pay patient liability after Medicare payments. There is no enrollment necessary for Tricare for Life and to be eligible, members must be Tricare and Medicare Eligible and have purchased Medicare Part B coverage. An exception to the requirement for Part B coverage exists when the beneficiary that is Medicare eligible is the spouse of an Active Duty Service Member. In some instances Tricare for Life is primary payer when the services are normally a Tricare benefit but not covered by Medicare. This includes drug charges, when Medicare benefit limits are attained and services performed outside the United States or in a Veterans Affairs facility where Medicare does not pay. TFL does not pay patient liability for services that are not a Tricare benefit even though they may be paid by Medicare, such as chiropractic benefits. The policy limitations applying to Tricare also apply to TFL and must therefore be deemed medically necessary and skilled care. Custodial care therefore is not covered. In 2004 the Tricare for Life benefit was transferred from the individual regional Tricare contractors. Medical claims are processed by the national Tricare Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contractor (TDEFIC- Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation). Pharmacy claims are processed by the Tricare Pharmacy Contractor (Express Scripts) and Overseas TFL claims are processed by the Tricare Overseas Program Contractor (as of September 2010 this will be International SOS using Wisconsin Physicians Service as their Fiscal Intermediary partner). = Tricare Young Adult (TYA) = Tricare Young Adult (TYA) is a premium-based health care plan available for purchase by qualified dependents who have aged out of Tricare at age 21, or age 23 for full-time college students. Dependents are eligible if they are unmarried, not eligible for either Tricare coverage or their own employer- sponsored health care coverage, and their sponsor is Tricare eligible.Tricare Young Adult Retrieved April 2011 Eligible dependents have the option to purchase Tricare Standard/Extra health coverage on a month-to-month basis. Purchased coverage includes medical and pharmacy benefits but does not include dental. A premium-based Tricare Prime benefit was to be available later in 2011. The signing of the National Defense Authorization Act in January 2011 aligned Tricare with the provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and led to the creation of TYA.New Tricare Program Offers Coverage for Young Adults Under 26. Retrieved from http://tricare.mil/mediacenter/news.aspx?fid=706. Enrollment began on 1 May 2011.Tricare Young Adult begins; monthly premiums set Stars and Stripes, April 11, 2011 = Tricare Supplement = In addition to the Tricare options listed above, military retirees can opt for a Tricare supplement plan. Tricare supplement was designed to help military retirees and their families save money on unexpected out of pocket expenses that are not covered by Tricare. Out of pocket costs that may be alleviated by Tricare supplement can include specialists, surgeries, and hospital stays. The Tricare supplement plan can be beneficial for Tricare standard beneficiaries who are covered under a 75/25 plan that does not cover all expenses in the event of an unexpected illness or accident. Program administration The ultimate responsible organization for administration of Tricare is the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System, which organized the Tricare Management Activity (TMA). The Tricare Management Activity contracts with several large health insurance corporations to provide claims processing, customer service and other administrative functions to the Tricare program. =Basic structure= Currently, there are three regional Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSCs), a Medicare/Tricare Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contractor (TDEFIC), and a Tricare Pharmacy contractor, who administers both Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) and Retail Pharmacy (TRRx) programs.

Route 1 is the primary east-west road on the island of Newfoundland. The eastern terminus of Route 1 is St. John's. From there, the highway crosses the island to Channel-Port aux Basques, its western terminus. From there, the Trans-Canada Highway is carried across the Cabot Strait by ferry to North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Route description Trans Canada Highway Route 1 at Corner Brook. This is a 4-lane section at this point in the highway's 903-kilometre length. The following description details the highway from its eastern terminus to its western terminus. Route 1's official eastern terminus is at the interchange with Logy Bay Road in the northeastern part of the city. The highway proceeds west on the Outer Ring Road, a freeway. Route 1 maintains the name Outer Ring Road, intersecting with St. John's roads such as Aberdeen Avenue, Portugal Cove Road, Torbay Road, Allandale Road, Thorburn Road, Topsail Road and Kenmount Road until the interchange with Pitts Memorial Drive, 20 km to the west. Route 1 proceeds in a generally southwestern direction for another 25 km as it follows the southern shore of Conception Bay (several kilometres inland) until it reaches the interchange with Route 13 where it turns west and then northwest, continuing for another 29 km on a 4-lane expressway to Whitbourne where the divided highway ends at the interchange with Route 80/81. Route 1 transitions to a 2-lane controlled access highway and continues northwest from Whitbourne along the isthmus of the Avalon Peninsula and 188 km north to Glovertown, bypassing Clarenville, small communities like Arnold's Cove, Goobies and passing through Terra Nova National Park; park admission is not required to use Route 1. The Bonavista Peninsula and Burin Peninsula can be accessed via interchanges near Clarenville and Goobies, respectively. From Glovertown, the highway proceeds northwest 182 km to Badger, bypassing Gander, Glenwood. Lewisporte (about 11 km north on Route 340), Norris Arm Bishop's Falls and Grand Falls-Windsor; Route 1 has a 6 km 4-lane section through Grand Falls-Windsor. As of August 2008, there are no gas stations along the highway between the towns of Gander and Bishop's Falls. The Isles of Notre Dame region of the province, which includes Fogo, the Twillingate Islands, New World Island and surrounding areas, can be accessed via Route 340 at the Notre Dame Junction interchange near Lewisporte. The Bay d'Espoir region can be accessed via the Bay D'Espoir Highway near Botwood. Botwood, Point Leamington and Leading Tickles can be accessed via the Botwood Highway, officially Route 350 at an interchange in the Bishop's Falls-Grand Falls-Windsor area. From Badger, Route 1 heads due north for 64 km to Springdale where the highway swings southwest for 137 km to Pasadena, passing through Deer Lake. At Pasadena, the highway transitions to a 4-lane expressway and continues southwest along the south shore of Deer Lake before following the Humber River through the narrow Humber Valley. The 4-lane section proceeds for 38 km in a southwest direction, where it transitions back to a 2-lane controlled access highway west of the interchange with Route 450 (Lewin Parkway), southwest of Corner Brook. From the Confederation Drive interchange, Route 1 proceeds for 213 km in a southwest direction, bypassing Stephenville (accessible via Route 460 and Route 490) and passing through the Codroy Valley (where it is a 2-lane uncontrolled access highway) to Port aux Basques. It terminates southeast of the town at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal. New alignment New highway construction during the 1990s extended Route 1 on what is called the Outer Ring Road to the interchange with Logy Bay Road in the northeast part of St. John's, including passing by the Stavanger Drive Shopping Area. Prior to this construction, Route 1 and the Trans-Canada Highway designation began at St. John's City Hall on New Gower Street and proceeded west on Pitts Memorial Drive and then on the current alignment of Route 1 to the southwest. It is for this reason that the city named its hockey arena and convention centre Mile One Centre, adjacent to the city hall. To follow an unofficial alignment of Route 1 from St. John's City Hall, one must head geographically east for 1.5 km into the southeastern part of the city, continuing onto Duckworth Street (Route 60). Proceed north for 1 km on Ordnance Street and King's Bridge Road before turning east for 1.5 km along the north shore of Quidi Vidi Lake on The Boulevard. Continue north on East White Hills Road, which becomes controlled access several hundred metres north of its intersection with The Boulevard. The East White Hills Road transitions into the Outer Ring Road 4 km to the north at the interchange with the Logy Bay Road.

This original sentence: :The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog would, after being disemvowelled, look like this: :Th qck brwn fx jmps vr th lzy dg Disemvoweling is a common feature of SMS language as disemvoweling requires little cognitive effort to read, so it is often used where space is costly. The word disemvoweling is a portmanteau combining vowel and disembowel. The word was used with precisely this meaning in the 1939 novel Finnegans Wake (p. 515). History A technique dubbed splat out was used by Usenet moderators to prevent flamewars, by substituting a \\"splat\\" (i.e., asterisk) for some letters, often the vowels, of highly charged words in postings. Examples include Nazi‚ÜíN*z*, evolution‚Üí*v*l*t**n, gun control‚Üíg*n c*ntr*l. \\"The purpose is not to make the word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use.\\" The term \\"disemvoweling\\"‚Äîattested from 1990‚Äîwas occasionally used for the splat-out of vowels. Teresa Nielsen Hayden used the vowel-deletion technique in 2002 for internet forum moderation on her blog Making Light. This was termed disemvoweling by Arthur D. Hlavaty later in the same thread. Nielsen Hayden joined the group blog Boing Boing as community manager in August 2007 , when it re-enabled comments on its posts, and implemented disemvoweling. Gawker Media sites adopted disemvoweling as a moderation tool in August 2008. On 30 October 2008, TIME magazine listed disemvoweling as #42 of their \\"Top 50 Inventions of 2008\\". Xeni Jardin, co-editor of Boing Boing, said of the practice, \\"the dialogue stays, but the misanthrope looks ridiculous, and the emotional sting is neutralized.\\" Also, Boing Boing producers claim that disemvoweling sends a clear message to internet forums as to types of behavior that are unacceptable. After Jeff Bezos acquired The Washington Post in 2013, one of his ideas was to install a feature that allowed a reader to \\"disemvowel\\" an article they didn't enjoy, the idea being that another reader would have to pay to reinstate the vowels. Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper's chief product and technology officer, said \\"the idea didn‚Äôt go far\\". Criticism In July 2008, New York Times reporter Noam Cohen criticized disemvoweling as a moderation tool, citing a June 2008 dispute about the deletion of all posts on Boing Boing that mentioned sex columnist Violet Blue. In the Boing Boing comment threads resulting from this controversy, Nielsen Hayden used the disemvoweling technique. Cohen noted that disemvoweling was \\"Not quite censorship, but not quite unfettered commentary either.\\" A subsequent unsigned case study on online crisis communication asserted that \\"removing the vowels from participants' comments only increased the gulf between the editors and the community\\" during the controversy. Matt Baumgartner, a blogger at the Albany Times Union, reported in August 2009 that the newspaper's lawyers had told him to stop disemvoweling comments. Implementation Nielsen Hayden originally disemvoweled postings manually, using Microsoft Word. Because the letter Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, there are a variety of ways to treat it. Nielsen Hayden's policy was never to remove Y, in order to maintain legibility. The technique has been facilitated by plug-in filters to automate the process. The first, for MovableType, was written in 2002; others are available for WordPressDisemvowel plugins and other content management systems.

Looking south along Octavia Street from Jackson Street. This is one of the few blocks in San Francisco still paved in brick. Octavia Boulevard (designated as Octavia Street north of Hayes Street) is a major street in San Francisco, California that replaced the Hayes Valley portion of the damaged two-level Central Freeway. Once a portion of Octavia Street alongside shadowy, fenced-off land beneath the elevated U.S. Route 101 roadway, Octavia Boulevard was redeveloped and redesigned upon the suggestion of Mark Jolles of San Francisco. Due to multiple city ballot measures regarding the damaged Central Freeway and significant controversy, Mayor Willie Brown and the Board of Supervisors appointed a committee assisted by the planning department to come up with a solution. Replacing the freeway over Market Street was not acceptable because it impeded on the Market Street view corridor. A replacement tunnel would have to go below a Market Street Muni Rail tunnel, therefore would be too deep, so was not feasible. At a public meeting, Jolles compared the central freeway traffic volumes to those on 8th and 9th street south of Market. He noted that Octavia Street, redesigned as a boulevard, could handle the same volumes. This would make better use of the freeway's right-of-way for additional street space and new housing without the visual impact of an elevated roadway. Comparable examples cited as boulevards were the configuration of Park Presidio Blvd, Funston Street, and 14th Avenue in the Richmond District, and Sunset Boulevard in the Sunset District, all in San Francisco. In addition, Jolles recalled growing up in the Washington, DC, area. He was familiar with boulevard designs there including K Street as well as boulevards that substituted for freeways in the Washington suburbs such as Viers Mill Road and Connecticut Avenue. Paris and the Champs Elysee design and Napoleon's sponsorship of Baron Haussman's grand boulevards imposed on the maze like Paris street system are comparisons too. They reflect Washington's other grand boulevards in the L'enfant plan. The French influence on the Reforma and boulevards in Mexico City during Maximilian's reign in Mexico are models as well. All of these examples inspired and suggested a boulevard design for Octavia would work. This type of road design provides for better overall access to the street grid than a grade separated freeway. A boulevard separates local traffic from through traffic while still allowing for flexibility during congestion. This benefits motorists who can easily change their route during backups. This is ideal for busy urban corridors. For elevated freeways, due to limited access to local streets, traffic cannot readily adjust when needed. Also noted during the discussions was that during heavy traffic, travel times on the boulevard would be comparable to those of a backed-up elevated freeway. This suggests there was no benefit to replacing an urban freeway with one of the same limited access design. Finally, Jolles lived on Haight Street near the freeway for several years in the 1980s. He remembers the freeway blocking views of Victorian structures and the loss of natural sunlight. Blight was caused by the double decker concrete behemoth overwhelming street life with noise, dust, and shadows. Crime and prostitutes lingering below the structure are also strong memories. This was his motivation to attend the meetings and suggest a more human scale solution to improving mobility in the area. There were two other suggestions made during the meeting. One was to provide a full surface street crosstown boulevard. This included removing the entire elevated freeway along Division to make that a Boulevard as well. When a block of public housing was being replaced at Webster a better connection from that divided street to Oak and Fell could be added. This could have provided an entire surface boulevard from 16th Street all the way to Geary. Improved development along Division could have followed. However, just removing the Octavia Blvd section of freeway was controversial, so the entire solution was considered politically unfeasible. Finally, there was a suggestion to increase capacity, mobility, and access for non-auto trips along Oak and Fell. This included a future branch of the Market Street F Line west as a couplet along Oak and Fell towards Golden Gate Park. This would provide an attractive non-auto alternative from downtown for commuters, tourists, recreational, and community access to Alamo Square, Haight Street, the Panhandle, and Golden Gate Park's cultural and recreational resources. The boulevard is merely four blocks long from Market to Fell Street, containing multiple lanes that separate local and through traffic. On Octavia, homes and businesses located immediately on the street are served by the quieter outer roadways, while lanes leading to and from the rebuilt Central Freeway spur connect faster traffic with the inner roadways. Having replaced a freeway, the boulevard distributes traffic smoothly and evenly throughout the immediate neighborhood, while maintaining the links to the major San Francisco traffic arterials that the old elevated freeway used to connect to directly, including Fell and Oak Streets (which serve the city's western neighborhoods) and Franklin and Gough Streets (which serve northern neighborhoods and the Golden Gate Bridge). A brand new park named Hayes Green was created as part of the boulevard project. It lies on Octavia between Fell and Hayes Street. North of Hayes Street, Octavia continues as Octavia Street through the Western Addition, Pacific Heights and Marina neighborhoods to Bay Street, at Fort Mason. Other freeway removal projects in the San Francisco Bay, due to seismic stability (or collapse), include the replacement of San Francisco's Embarcadero Freeway, and the reuse of the collapsed Cypress Structure's right- of-way in neighboring Oakland.  Origin of name  The name refers to Octavia Gough, sister of Charles H. Gough. A contractor who carried out the planking and paving of many San Francisco streets, Charles served on the commission to design the layout of streets in the Western Addition, according to an obituary published in the San Francisco Call on July 27, 1895.  Related places nearby  Parallel to Octavia and immediately west of it is Gough Street. Octavia is 8 blocks east of Divisadero, which at the time of its naming was the nearest major north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare. \\"Octavia\\" is a name which means, \\"the eighth\\". There is an octagon-shaped building (named The Octagon House at 2645 Gough Street, on the northwest corner of Gough and Green streets. As of 2013, it operates as a historic museum, housing colonial-era folk art and documents. Today, the Academy of Art University owns and operates a building on the street for housing purposes.

During flight testing in 1933, it outperformed the Douglas entry and was chosen the winner. Operational history The Navy no longer was interested in two-seat fighters, and therefore only the one XF3U prototype aircraft was built. The XF3U subsequently evolved into a dive bomber, and became the XSBU prototype for the SBU-1 Corsair. Specifications References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Angelucci,Enzo.

He was vice president of the Collective of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders (CODESA).Members of the CODESA secretariat He was active in Moroccan trade unions and leftist Moroccan spheres. Biography He has been jailed five times for nationalist activities, fired from his job, and for a long period of time had his passport confiscated. On September 13, 1993, he was detained for the first time, along with other Sahrawis, on the Moroccan- Algerian border in the region of Tata, where he was attempting to join the POLISARIO. He was condemned to one year in prison and a fine of 10,000 dirhams. On November 24, 1997, he was detained again in the Dakhla region, trying to cross the Moroccan-Mauritanian border.

Tamek wishes Western Sahara to become an independent state under the auspices of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, the government-in-exile created by the Polisario Front, based in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria. During his incarceration, he has been on numerous hunger strikes, and in 2003 came close to death before being released in a general royal pardon on January 7, 2004, on orders from the \\"Equity and Reconciliation Commission\\".

The German language comic market is not as large or strong in sales as in most other European countries: comics account for only approximately 3% of printed matter in Germany. The main publishers of original material are Schwarzer Turm, Weissblech Comics, Gringo Comics, and Zwerchfell Verlag. There continues to be a large presence of translated material in the German language market. Panini Comics holds licensing agreements to publish translated Marvel and DC Comics, among other things. Other comic publishers of licensed versions of foreign language material, particularly those from Franco-Belgian origin (which started to become a major force on the German comics scene from the late-1960s onward, presently eclipsing native productions), include Egmont Ehapa, Carlsen Comics, and others. History The German comic has many early forerunners. In the 19th century, satire publications like Simplicissimus and Fliegende Bl√§tter featured many caricatures that became internationally well-known. At around the same time, Rodolphe T√∂pffer (Switzerland) and Wilhelm Busch (Germany) published many comic strips. They are now generally recognized as pioneers of the comic form, predating the development of the American comic strip. German born and influenced artists Rudolph Dirks and Lyonel Feininger brought the innovations to American Sunday papers. For most of the post-World War II 20th century, the German-speaking comic market was dominated by translated importations like The Adventures of Tintin (German: Tim und Struppi), Asterix, and Donald Duck. Towards the end of the century, superheroes, manga, and Calvin and Hobbes began to have a large presence in the translated comic market. However, there were some successful German creations during this time. Between 1934 and 1937, the comic strip Vater und Sohn (\\"Father and Son\\") appeared in the weekly illustrated magazine Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. It was one of the most popular German strips of all time. It was created by Erich Ohser, under the pseudonym e.o.plauen (which stands for \\"Erich Ohser from Plauen\\" and was adopted by him after being blacklisted by the Nazis for his political cartoons). Comic books were not published in Nazi Germany because such literature was banned under the Nazi party.Ross, Corey. Media and the Making of Modern Germany. See the chapter ‚ÄúNational Socialist Restructuring of Media and Leisure‚Äù The reaction of the SS towards the comic book character Superman was negative because the creator of Superman was Jewish, even though they regarded themselves as the primary representatives of the master race and were themselves trying to create a super race: In post-war (the 1950s and 1960s) West Germany, comic books and strips were largely inspired by American models. Comic books for children and young people were developed, such as Rolf Kauka's Fix and Foxi and adventure comics like Sigurd and Nick by Hansrudi W√§scher. After 1960 the West German publishers commissioned foreign artists and studios. Bessy was a Belgian production for the German market, Wendy was produced in Britain, and Gespenster Geschichten was drawn by Spanish artists. Despite dubious art quality and increasing resistance from educators, these comics were very popular. Of somewhat better quality were the comics in weekly news magazines. In the 1950s, the series Nick Knatterton by Manfred Schmidt was published in the news magazine Quick. The detective story strip was inspired by Schmidt's dislike of Superman, and was in part intended as a parody. The news magazine Stern had several comics: ' (by Loriot), ' (by Hans J√ºrgen Press), Jimmy das Gummipferd and Tar√≥. Since 1953 the television magazine H√∂rzu has a long-running comic with the hedgehog Mecki. Germany has also popular advertising comic books like Lurchi, Max und Luzie, Mike der Taschengeldexperte, and Knax. Comics in East Germany were less various in comparison with those in the west, but were more consistently of high quality. The most prominent publication was Mosaik, in which Hannes Hegen chronicled the adventures of the Digedags. When Hegen left in 1975, he took the characters with him. Mosaik continued without him and the characters were replaced by the Abrafaxe. The comic magazine Atze presented complete short stories with political contents, often depicting everyday life in the GDR, the history of the workers' movement or the communist anti-fascist resistance movement. More popular were the continuing stories of the two mice Fix und Fax (not to be confused with Kauka's Fix and Foxi) that bookended every issue of Atze.Thiel, Paul (translated by Dwight R. Decker), \\"Comics in the German Democratic Republic,\\" The Comics Journal #45 (March 1979), pp. 55-57, 59. The first successful German-language comic strip with speech balloons was 1927 the Austrian daily strip Tobias Seicherl in Das Kleine Blatt. Popular German- language comics in Switzerland are Globi and Papa Moll. Until the beginning of the 1980s, German comics remained to a large extent limited to children's comics. Much as in the American comic scene, creators interested in making more sophisticated comics have had to battle the prejudice that comics are a medium that is only suitable for children. Sometimes political cartoonists from satirical magazines like Pardon and Titanic tried the medium comics, like Chlodwig Poth, Volker Ernsting, F. K. Waechter, Robert Gernhardt, Marie Marcks, and Hans Traxler. Since the mid-1980s, German-speaking artists have been developing alternative and avant-garde comics. This development was led by figures such as Gerhard Seyfried; Br√∂sel, whose character Werner captured the zeitgeist of young people in West Germany during the 1980s; Ralf K√∂nig (Der bewegte Mann); Walter Moers (Kleines Arschloch); and Matthias Schultheiss, who gained international acclaim (largely by working in the French market). A prominent alternative comics magazine is Moga Mobo which has been published since 1994. In 2000, Comicforum debuted on the web and acted as a hub for German comic creators. In 2004, it was recognized by the Interessenverband Comic, describing it as a factor the German comic landscape can no longer be imagined without. The most prestigious comic award for German-language comic artists is the Max & Moritz Prize. *1984: (Austria) *1986: Matthias Schultheiss *1988: Franziska Becker *1990: Gerhard Seyfried *1992: Ralf K√∂nig *1993: Walter Moers *1994: *1996: (Switzerland) *1998: *2000: *2002: *2004: *2006: *2008: Anke Feuchtenberger *2010: (Austria) *2012: *2014: Ulli Lust (Austria) *2016: *2018: Reinhard Kleist See also * List of German comic books * List of German comic creators  Notes  References * Small Press Expo 2000 (CBLDF, 2000), pp. 253‚Äì259 External links *German comics page by the Goethe-Institut *Complete list of comic strips printed in German newspapers 2007 (German language) *Webcomic- Verzeichnis List of German language webcomics Category:German literature ","title":"German comics"},{"id":"2996701","title":"Jari M√§enp√§√§"},{"id":"2996702","text":"is an accomplished Japanese animator and anime director.

Although he was from Milan, most of his professional life was spent in London and with Frederick, the Prince of Wales. Personal life Giuseppe Sammartini was born in Milan, Italy. He had a younger brother, Giovanni Battista Sammartini, who also became a particularly renowned composer and oboist. Both brothers took oboe lessons from their French father Alexis Saint-Martin. Although born in Milan, Giuseppe found his success in other parts of Europe. His first trip was to Brussels, and from there he made his way to London where he would go on to spend the rest of his life. Giuseppe did return to Milan for his sister Madalena's marriage on 13 February 1728. In July 1728 Giuseppe also travelled to Brussels with his pupil Gaetano Parenti. Performer Sammartini was an exceptionally skilled oboist. He could play the flute and recorder, as was customary at the time. Before moving to London, he was the oboist at in Milan around 1717. He then became the oboist at the Teatro Regio Ducale in 1720. He even gained fame in London as \\"the greatest [oboist] the world had ever known\\". He performed in places such as Lincoln's Inn Fields, Hickford's Room, Castle concerts, and in the opera orchestra at The King's Theatre. As an oboist, Giuseppe was unbelievably successful, and significantly advanced the level of oboe playing. Giuseppe was even able to make the oboe sound voice-like at times. One of his most notable students was the Englishman Thomas Vincent. Composer He was well versed in the ways of counterpoint and proper harmony. This made him a very skilled composer of his time. One of Giuseppe's first published collections was a set of 12 trio sonatas. It was published in London by Walsh & Hare. Sammartini's career as a composer advanced when he was hired as the music master for the Prince of Wales, Frederick, and his wife Augusta. He worked for them and their children from 1736 until his death in 1750. While working for the family, Sammartini dedicated many works to the different members of the family. His 12 sonatas op. 1 were dedicated to Frederick, and his 12 trios op. 3 to Augusta. Sammartini was clearly very attached to this family, writing everything from these wonderful collections to simple birthday tunes for the children. Most of Sammartini's chamber music was played and re- published regularly during his life. However, many of the concertos and overtures that Sammartini wrote were not published until after his death, but then gained wide acceptance, even more than other Italian composers such as Corelli. Musical style Although Sammartini wrote in a later Baroque style, he also incorporated many Classical elements. Sammartini was forward thinking as a composer, and even used ideas such as a galant style and Sturm und Drang, (the idea of extreme and stormy emotions). Sammartini had other clearly forward thinking musical trends. An example of this would be the number of movements in some of his concertos and symphonies. Being primarily an instrumental composer, Sammartini wrote a significant amount of solo sonatas. Due to his professional instrument, many of these sonatas were written for the flute, recorder, and oboe. One of his unique idioms was starting a sonata with a slow movement. His larger orchestral works often featured four to five movements with slow transitional movements. Giuseppe Sammartini was one of the first composers to write keyboard concertos in England, causing him to be an exceptionally influential composer for his time. Works 24 sonatas for recorder and bass, 30 trios for flutes or violins, 24 concerti grossi, 4 keyboard concertos, oboe concertos, 16 overtures, some cello sonatas, some flute duets. One of Sammartini's most famous piece is his Concerto in F major for recorder, strings and continuo. Notes Sources  * * Further reading *Brown, A.

Although the original idea of helicopter money describes central banks making payments directly to individuals, economists have used the term 'helicopter money' to refer to a wide range of different policy ideas, including the 'permanent' monetization of budget deficits ‚Äì with the additional element of attempting to shock beliefs about future inflation or nominal GDP growth, in order to change expectations. A second set of policies, closer to the original description of helicopter money, and more innovative in the context of monetary history, involves the central bank making direct transfers to the private sector financed with base money, without the direct involvement of fiscal authorities. This has also been called a citizens' dividend or a distribution of future seigniorage. The name \\"helicopter money\\" was first coined by Milton Friedman in 1969, when he wrote a parable of dropping money from a helicopter to illustrate the effects of monetary expansion. The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's Lost Decade. In November 2002, Ben Bernanke, then Federal Reserve Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.  Origins  Although very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including Major Douglas and the Social Credit Movement, Nobel winning economist Milton Friedman is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper \\"The Optimum Quantity of Money\\" (1969), where he included the following parable: > Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and > drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, > hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that > everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be > repeated. Originally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as quantitative easing. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of liquidity trap, when central banks have reached the so-called 'zero lower bound'. Friedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the Pigou effect, in his 1968 AER Presidential address. Specifically, Friedman argues that \\"[the] revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel ‚Äì namely changes in wealth ‚Äì whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates.\\" Friedman is clear that money must be produced \\"in other ways\\" than open-market operations, which ‚Äì like QE ‚Äì involve \\"simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth.\\" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, \\"Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money.\\" It is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand. The idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. Ben Bernanke famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \\"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti- deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \\"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\\" In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future. The Irish economist, Eric Lonergan, also argued in 2002 in the Financial Times, that central banks consider cash transfers to households as an alternative to further reductions in interest rates, also on the grounds of financial stability.Beyond interest rates, Financial Times, 9 September 2002 In 2003, Willem Buiter, then chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, revived the concept of helicopter money in a theoretical paper, arguing that base money is not a liability, which provides a more rigorous case for Friedman and Haberler's Pigouvian intuitions. Starting from 2012, economists have also called this idea \\"quantitative easing for the people.\\"  Policy response to the global financial crisis  In December 2008, Eric Lonergan and Martin Wolf suggested in the Financial Times that central banks make cash transfers directly to households, financed with base money, to combat the threat of global deflation. From around 2012 onwards, some economists began advocating variants of helicopter drops, including 'QE for the people', and a 'debt jubilee' financed with the monetary base. These proposals reflected a sense that conventional policies, including QE, were failing or having many adverse effects - on either financial stability or the distribution of wealth and income. In 2013, the chairman of the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), Adair Turner, who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.  Implementation  Although the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income. Under a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring. In 2016, the European Central Bank (ECB) launched a TLTRO programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks. Also, the use of differential interest rates on tiered reserves to support commercial banks' profitability in the face of negative interest rates, opens up another source of helicopter drop - albeit intermediated by banks. In the case of the Eurozone, the use of TLTROs is believed by some economists to provide a legal and administratively tractable means of introducing transfers to households. The economist, Eric Lonergan, argued in 2016 that legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone could be structured via zero coupon, perpetual loans, which all European adult citizens would be eligible to receive. The loans could be administered by eligible commercial banks, and under certain conditions the loans would be net interest income positive to the central bank. This idea was revived in 2019 by Frances Coppola, in her book, The Case for People‚Äôs Quantitative Easing, and also by researchers at BlackRock, including Stanley Fischer, and also by the French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry.  Controversies  Many economists would argue that helicopter money, in the form of cash transfers to households, should not be seen as a substitute for fiscal policy. Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons. =Differences from quantitative easing= Like all expansionary monetary policies in general, quantitative easing (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an 'asset swap'. The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet. Economists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' ‚Äì that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time. =Implications for central bank balance sheets= One of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional open-market operations the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial. Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important. What matters is whether expansion of base money can be reversed in the future, or there are other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed. The European Central Bank can, in fact, mandate an increase in its capital, and the introduction of tiered reserves and interest on reserves gives central banks an array of tools to protect their own net income and the demand for reserves. Supporters Former chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke is known to be one of the proponents of helicopter money when he gave a speech in November 2002 arguing, in the case of Japan, that \\"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\\" In April 2016, Ben Bernanke wrote a blog post arguing that \\"such programs may be the best available alternative. It would be premature to rule them out.\\" Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen also admitted that helicopter money could be an option in \\"extreme situations.\\" Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter is also known to be a prominent advocate of the concept. Other proponents include Financial Times' Chief Commentator Martin Wolf, Oxford economists John Muellbauer, and Simon Wren-Lewis, Economist Steve Keen, the political economist Mark Blyth of Brown University, Berkeley economics professor and former Treasury advisor, Brad DeLong, UCLA economics professor, Roger Farmer, American macro hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, Irish economist and Fund manager Eric Lonergan, Anatole Kaletsky, Romain Baeriswyl, Martin Sandbu,, Jean Pisani-Ferry. The idea also finds support among central bankers. For example, former governor of the Irish central bank Patrick Honohan said he believes the policy would work while the ECB's chief economist Peter Praet once said \\"All central banks can do it.\\" The Vice-Governor of the Czech Central Bank Mojm√≠r Hampl published a paper in which he writes that \\"the idea offers many virtues and advantages compared to other forms of unconventional monetary policy, especially obliterating the need to rely on a complicated transmission mechanism, allowing much easier communication to the public, and boosting consumer confidence when most needed.\\" Bill Gross, Portfolio Manager of the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund also argues for the implementation of a basic income, funded by helicopter drops. In August 2019, prominent central bankers Stanley Fischer and Philip Hildebrand co-authored a paper published by BlackRock in which they propose a form of helicopter money. Critics Hyperinflation in Germany in 1923 =Inflationary effect= In the past the idea had been dismissed because it was thought that it would inevitably lead to hyperinflation. Consequently, a range of concerns include the fact that helicopter money would undermine trust in the currency (which ultimately would lead to hyperinflation). This concern was particularly voiced by German Economist (and former Chief Economist at the ECB) Otmar Issing in a paper written in 2014. Later in 2016, he declared in an interview: \\"I think the whole idea of the helicopter money is downright devastating. For this is nothing more than a declaration of bankruptcy of the monetary policy\\" Richard Koo makes a similar argument when saying \\"if such envelopes arrived day after day, the entire country would quickly fall into a panic as people lose all sense of what their currency is worth.\\" This clashes with the argument that people would not spend much of the money they receive (and therefore helicopter money cannot be inflationary). =Would helicopter money be spent?= Several prominent economists such as central banker Raghuram Rajan are against helicopter money on the grounds that helicopter money would be ineffective because people would not spend the money. In response, Lord Adair Turner argues: \\"Money financed deficits will always stimulate nominal demand. By comparison debt finance deficits might do so, but might not.\\" Contradicting this argument, several surveys conducted in the Eurozone concluded however that between 30 and 55% of the distributed money would be spent by households, in effect resulting in a boost of around 2% of GDP.Helicopter Money ‚Äì Let It Rain?, Astellon Capital, June 2016 =\\"There is no such thing as a free lunch\\"= Another range of critics involve the idea that there cannot be such thing as \\"free money\\" or as economists say \\"there is no such thing as a free lunch.\\" This criticism was notably expressed by Bank for International Settlements researchers Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat and Anna Zabai, who claimed that helicopter drops to citizens would necessarily involve for the central bank to pay interests on the extra reserves being supplied. In a response, the former IMF economist Biagio Bossone challenges the later assumption and argues that \\"helicopter money is a 'free lunch' in the simple sense that, if it works and succeeds in closing the output gap, people won‚Äôt have to repay it through higher taxes or undesired (above optimal) inflation.\\" =Legality= Other critics claim helicopter money would be outside of the mandate of central banks, because it would \\"blur the lines between fiscal policy and monetary policy\\" mainly because helicopter money would involve 'fiscal effects' which is traditionally the role of governments to decide on. However advocates of helicopter money such as Eric Lonergan and Simon Wren- Lewis invalidate this argument by observing that standard monetary policy tools also have fiscal effects. The European Central Bank explained, in a letter to MEP Jon√°s Fern√°ndez, that \\"legal complexities could still arise if the scheme could be seen as the ECB financing an obligation of the public sector vis-√†-vis third parties, as this would also violate the prohibition of monetary financing.\\" However this refers to a very unlikely and undesirable case where helicopter money payments by the central bank would substitute to welfare payments (which are a liability of governments). =Accounting issues= Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann also voiced opposition against helicopter money, arguing it would \\"tear gaping holes in central bank balance sheets. Ultimately, it would be down to the euro-area countries, and thus the taxpayer, to shoulder the costs because central banks would be unprofitable for quite some time.\\" The National bank of Belgium also released a paper making a similar argument. = Threat against central bank independence = Endra Curren and Ben Holland of Bloomberg stated \\"That type of stimulus [helicopter money] used to be taboo, in part because it risks eroding the independence from politics that monetary policy makers prize [...] History is littered with cautionary tales in which blurring the lines between central bank and Treasury coffers led to runaway inflation.\\" In the Eurozone On 10 March 2016, the idea became increasingly popular in Europe after Mario Draghi the President of the European Central Bank, said in a press conference that he found the concept 'very interesting'. This statement was followed by another statement from the ECB's Peter Praet who declared: > \\"Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and you distribute > it to people. That‚Äôs helicopter money. Helicopter money is giving to the > people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit > you make on the future banknotes. The question is, if and when is it > opportune to make recourse to that sort of instrument which is really an > extreme sort of instrument.\\" Conference on \\"QE for People\\" organised at the European parliament by Positive Money (17 February 2016) In 2015, a European campaign called \\"Quantitative Easing for People\\" was launched and is effectively promoting the concept of Helicopter Money, along with other proposals for 'Green QE' and 'Strategic QE' which are other types of monetary financing operations by central banks involving public investment programmes. The campaign was supported by 20 organisations across Europe and more than 116 economists. On 17 June 2016, 18 Members of the European Parliament (including Philippe Lamberts, Paul Tang and Fabio De Masi) signed an open letter calling on the ECB to \\"provide evidence- based analysis of the potential effects of the alternative proposals mentioned above, and to clarify under which conditions their implementation would be legal.\\" If it doesn't consider alternatives to QE, MEPs fear the ECB would leave itself \\"unprepared for a deterioration in economic conditions.\\" In October 2016, a survey showed that 54% Europeans think helicopter money would be a good idea, with only 14% against. In 2020, politicians, civil society organisations and economists debated issuing helicopter money as a response to the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. In the US In 2020, the US legislative system debated issuing two times a $1,000 check to each eligible adult citizen, described by media as 'Helicopter Money', as a response to the US coronavirus pandemic. However, this practice cannot be considered as 'Helicopter Money' as long as this money distribution is financed by the State (debt) and not by central bank money printing (monetary expansion). In Japan In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda in July 2016 it was widely reportedCan 'Helicopter Ben Bernanke' Save Japan?, retrieved July 28, 2016. that former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke advised the policy of monetizing more government debt created to fund infrastructure projects, ostensibly as a way to drop \\"Helicopter Money\\" on Japan to stimulate the economy and halt deflation in Japan. Financial markets began to front-run this stimulus effort days before it was announced when accounts of Bernanke's visit to Japan were first reported. Later in the month the Bank of Japan in an ongoing review of its monetary stimulus program was reported to be considering policies somewhat similar to \\"Helicopter Money\\", such as selling 50-year or perpetual bonds. However, even if the central bank commits to hold these 50-year government bonds for a very long time, that is not helicopter money as long as this money, financed by the state (debt) and not by central bank money printing per se, is not distributed to households directly.

History Before 1946, the U.S. military relied on specially-created programs to meet specific needs. They also made use of smaller training programs elsewhere. The closer integration of military forces and increasing complexity of strategy and technology necessitated the foundation of The National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. To better integrate all the education programs, Congress created the National Defense University in 1976. In 1981, the Joint Forces Staff College was created, followed by the Department of Defense Computer Institute (DODCI) in 1982, which later was renamed the Information Resources Management College. In 1984 the university created the Institute for National Strategic Studies to meet the demand for military research. After the Goldwater-Nichols Act and the House Armed Services Committee Skelton Panel Report, the University decided to seek authority to grant master's degrees. In 1993 President Bill Clinton signed into law a bill that allowed NDU to grant the degree of Master of Science in National Resource Strategy upon graduates of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and the Master of Science in National Security Strategy upon graduates of the National War College. The university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2008, an NDU professor had blown the whistle on the fact that a Chilean colleague at the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies of U.S. Southern Command headquartered at the university had not only been a member of military dictator Augusto Pinochet's DINA but was in addition accused of participating in the torture and murder of seven detainees in Chile.

His parents were Rosa Sarsfield Palacios (daughter of Jorge Sarsfield), whose ancestors were Irish, and Dalmacio V√©lez Baigorri, who died before his son was born.The Guardian He studied at the Jesuit college at the National University of C√≥rdoba, and was particularly adept at mathematics and languages, fluently speaking English, French, Italian and Latin. He earned a juris doctor in 1822. Upon finishing his studies, he married the former Paula Pi√±ero, and became very active in politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and was nominated as the Speaker of the House in 1825, a position that he took up the following year, becoming the position's youngest holder, as well as a vocal supporter of President Bernardino Rivadavia and the latter's policy in favor of centralized government. V√©lez Sarsfield was awarded a professorship of Economics at the Law Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires in 1826. He represented the Buenos Aires Province Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in a number of legal disputes with the Catholic Church, as well as with Santa Fe Province Governor Estanislao L√≥pez, and was named President of the Academy of Jurisprudence in 1835. C√≥rdoba. Souring relations with Governor Rosas forced V√©lez Sarsfield to leave in exile to Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1842. He befriended Unitarians Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz and Domingo Sarmiento (staunch opponents of Rosas), and worked with the latter in Europe before returning. He arrived to find his home destroyed by vandals and occupied by squatters; but despite their earlier dispute, Governor Rosas had the property returned to the respected lawyer. V√©lez Sarsfield allied himself with General Bartolom√© Mitre, a staunch advocate of Buenos Aires interests, following Rosas' overthrow, and served as counsel to Mitre in his opposition to the San Nicol√°s Agreement of 1852 (which Buenos Aires rejected). Following the province's secession, V√©lez Sarsfield drafted the State of Buenos Aires Constitution of 1854 for Governor Pastor Obligado. The province's defeat at the Battle of Cepeda resulted in its reunification with Argentina, towards which V√©lez Sarsfield helped craft a series of requisite amendments to the Argentine Constitution. Mitre's election to the presidency in 1862 made V√©lez Sarsfield the nation's Finance Minister. He obtained congressional passage in 1863 of the Commercial Code he had earlier created for Buenos Aires, and in 1864 began work on his landmark Civil Code. He also advanced the modernization of the agrarian sector, then dominated by livestock ranching, by funding the nation's first institute of agronomy. V√©lez Sarsfield was appointed Internal Affairs Minister by Mitre's successor, Domingo Sarmiento, in 1868. He encouraged immigration by having the numerous, private assistance leagues merged into the Central Immigration Commission, and on September 25, 1869, had Congress approve the Civil Code by acclamation; the document, since amended, was enacted on January 1, 1871. The aging jurist retired afterwards, and founded El Nacional. The new periodical coincided with the launch of Mitre's La Naci√≥n, however, and El Nacional closed. Dr. Dalmacio V√©lez Sarsfield died in Buenos Aires in 1875, at the age of 74; he was interred at La Recoleta Cemetery. The barrio of Velez Sarsfield in Buenos Aires is named after him. The V√©lez Sarsfield sports club, best known for its First Division football team, is indirectly named after him, having taken its name from a railway station bearing his name.

The bank's main activity was mortgage lending for residential and commercial customers, although in 2009 its business was transferred to Bank of Ireland and it became a shell company and stopped accepting new customers. The Bristol & West name has since been replaced by the Bank of Ireland brand. History The Building society was founded in 1850 as the Bristol, West of England and South Wales Permanent Building Society. It offered mortgages in the Bristol and the south west of England area and became a well known institution in the region. By 1996 Bristol & West was the 9th largest building society in the United Kingdom, at a time when the UK government relaxed rules on funding for building societies which led a number of Building Societies to demutualise and convert into banks. In 1997 Bristol & West demutualised and was sold to Bank of Ireland, becoming a division of the bank but maintaining its operations and branch network under the Bristol & West brand. The UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined the Bristol & West subsidiary Chase de Vere Financial Solutions for the \\"approval and issue of a misleading direct offer promotion\\" in December 2003.FSA FINAL NOTICE 17 December 2003 In 2005, Bristol & West sold its savings and investment business to the Britannia Building Society.

Its plot follows a young woman who, ostracized by her peers at an elite boarding school, enacts violent revenge via her psychokinetic ability to control snakes. Plot Jennifer Baylor is a poor young woman from West Virginia who possesses a supernatural power over snakes, an ability to control them and communicate with them. She and her father, Luke, left their home in disgrace, because when Jennifer was 7, some snakes she had been handling killed the town preacher's son. She refused to handle snakes ever again, though Luke now runs a pet store in California and often encourages her to use her power again. Luke is mentally disabled and obsessed with the Bible, unable to make meals for himself without burning them, and relies on Jennifer to care for him. Jennifer studies on a scholarship at the elite Green View School, where she is an outcast among her wealthy peers, all of whom are from prominent families, and who are largely protected by the school's headmistress, the imperious, pill- addicted Mrs. Calley. Her only real friends are the school's lunch lady, Martha, with whom Jennifer works to help supplement her tuition, and teacher Jeff Reed, whom is the only teacher who sees the corruption in the school for what it truly is. Jennifer becomes an unwitting target for Sandra Tremayne, an entitled bully, when Jennifer exposes that Sandra stole the answers to an exam. Sandra evades legitimate consequences when her father, a U.S. senator, makes a large donation to the school, but Jennifer no less becomes subject to numerous pranks and harassment from Sandra and her friends. Sandra hopes her torment and gaslighting will drive Jennifer to leave the school. Soon, Jane, an overweight student on the fringe of Sandra's social group, protests Sandra's excessive cruelty toward Jennifer, risking her alliance with Sandra. One afternoon, after Jennifer finishes her job in the cafeteria, she takes a shower in the empty gymnasium locker room. Upon exiting the shower, she finds that Sandra and her friends have stolen her clothing and belongings and hung them on pipes in the pool room. When Jennifer climbs a ladder to retrieve them, Sandra's boyfriend, Dayton, startles her by taking photographs with a flashbulb camera, causing her to fall naked into the pool. Dayton subsequently corners Jane in an elevator, and, aware of the fact that Jane is attracted to him, rapes her. Some time later, Jennifer is horrified to find that Sandra has purchased a beloved kitten from Jennifer's father's pet store, killed it, and hung it inside Jennifer's locker. That night, Jennifer finally decides to again exercise her power over snakes, invoking them in the pet store. A notable shift in her personality follows, and she cooly confronts Jane about Sandra murdering the kitten. Jane agrees to an alliance with Jennifer, seeking retaliation against Dayton. As a culmination to their torment of Jennifer, Sandra and her friends stage a kidnapping in which they abduct Jennifer from her home in the middle of the night. A reluctant Jane becomes embroiled in the plan, and watches as Dayton places Jennifer, bound and gagged, in the trunk of Sandra's car. With Dayton and her other friends following behind, Sandra drives into an empty parking garage. On the roof, they remove Jennifer from the trunk and torment her by driving their cars in circles around her. Unbeknownst to them, Jennifer invokes a multitude of snakes ranging in various sizes that descend on the scene, attacking all of her tormentors by strangling and biting them. Dayton is thrown off the parking garage to his death, while Sandra attempts to flee in her car, but Jennifer manifests a giant snake that causes her to crash the vehicle and die in a fire. Later in her office, Mrs. Calley threatens and blames Jennifer for the mysterious event, which has left six Green View students hospitalized, but there is no evidence proving Jennifer's guilt, and the witnesses have no memory of what occurred. After dismissing Jennifer, Mrs. Calley is attacked and killed by a snake. Jennifer and Jane hear her screams as they exit the school, and both respond with laughter. Cast Production Principal photography of Jennifer began on November 21, 1977 in Los Angeles, California. Release Jennifer opened theatrically on April 21, 1978. It subsequently had its New York City premiere on May 13, 1978, and its Los Angeles premiere on September 13, 1978. =Critical response= Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that \\"all things considered, Jennifer could be a whole lot worse\\", and noted that \\"while Miss Pelikan is not Sissy Spacek by a long shot, she does have a suitably spooky look in her eye\\". TV Guide called the film a \\"blatant Carrie rip-off\\". Bob Keaton of the Fort Lauderdale News also noted the film's similarities to Carrie, but praised Pelikan's performance as \\"terrific. She is unquestionably a rising star.\\" =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Kino Lorber on October 14, 2014.

In mathematics, the absolute Galois group GK of a field K is the Galois group of Ksep over K, where Ksep is a separable closure of K. Alternatively it is the group of all automorphisms of the algebraic closure of K that fix K. The absolute Galois group is well-defined up to inner automorphism. It is a profinite group. (When K is a perfect field, Ksep is the same as an algebraic closure Kalg of K. This holds e.g. for K of characteristic zero, or K a finite field.)  Examples  * The absolute Galois group of an algebraically closed field is trivial. * The absolute Galois group of the real numbers is a cyclic group of two elements (complex conjugation and the identity map), since C is the separable closure of R and [C:R] = 2\\\\. * The absolute Galois group of a finite field K is isomorphic to the group :: \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{Z}} = \\\\varprojlim \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z}. (For the notation, see Inverse limit.) :The Frobenius automorphism Fr is a canonical (topological) generator of GK.

This result is due to Adrien Douady and has its origins in Riemann's existence theorem. * More generally, let C be an algebraically closed field and x a variable. Then the absolute Galois group of K = C(x) is free of rank equal to the cardinality of C. This result is due to David Harbater and Florian Pop, and was also proved later by Dan Haran and Moshe Jarden using algebraic methods. * Let K be a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Qp. For p ‚â† 2, its absolute Galois group is generated by [K:Qp] + 3 elements and has an explicit description by generators and relations. This is a result of Uwe Jannsen and Kay Wingberg. Some results are known in the case p = 2, but the structure for Q2 is not known. *Another case in which the absolute Galois group has been determined is for the largest totally real subfield of the field of algebraic numbers.  Problems  * No direct description is known for the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. In this case, it follows from Belyi's theorem that the absolute Galois group has a faithful action on the dessins d'enfants of Grothendieck (maps on surfaces), enabling us to \\"see\\" the Galois theory of algebraic number fields. * Let K be the maximal abelian extension of the rational numbers.

Some general results  * Every profinite group occurs as a Galois group of some Galois extension,Fried & Jarden (2008) p.12 however not every profinite group occurs as an absolute Galois group. For example, the Artin‚ÄìSchreier theorem asserts that the only finite absolute Galois groups are either trivial or of order 2, that is only two isomorphism classes. * Every projective profinite group can be realized as an absolute Galois group of a pseudo algebraically closed field.

Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, duchess of Cajanello (1 October 184921 October 1892), was a Swedish author. Biography She was the daughter of the school principal John Olof Leffler and Gustava Wilhelmina Mittag. Her brother was noted mathematician G√∂sta Mittag-Leffler. Leffler was initially educated privately and then a student at the Wallinska skolan from the age of thirteen, at that time perhaps the most progressive school open to females in Stockholm. Her first volume of stories appeared in 1869, but the first to which she attached her name was Ur lifvet (\\"From Life,\\" 1882), a series of realistic sketches of the upper circles of Swedish society, followed, by three other collections with the same title. Her earliest plays, Sk√•despelerskan (\\"The Actress,\\" 1873), and its successors, were produced anonymously in Stockholm, but in 1883 her reputation was established by the success of Sanna Kvinnor (\\"True Women\\") and En r√§ddande engel (\\"An Angel of Deliverance\\"). Sanna Kvinnor is directed against false femininity, and was well received in Germany as well as in Sweden. This cites Ellen Key, Anne Charlotte Leffler (Stockholm, 1893). Anne Leffler had married G. Edgren in 1872, but about 1884 she was separated from her husband, who did not share her advanced views. She spent some time in England, and in 1885 produced her Hur man g√∂r gott (\\"How one does good\\"), followed in 1888 by Kampen f√∂r lyckan (\\"The Struggle for Happiness\\"), with which she was helped by Sofia Kovalevskaya. Another volume of the Ur Lifvet series appeared in 1889, and Familjelycka (\\"Domestic Happiness,\\" 1891) was produced in the year after her second marriage (to the Italian mathematician, Pasquale del Pezzo, duca di Cajanello). She was also active within the women's movement. In 1885, she spoke in favour of the Victorian dress reform, and raised the issue of dress reform in Sweden, which resulted in the foundation of the Swedish Dress Reform Association. Her dramatic method forms a connecting link between Ibsen and Strindberg, and its masculine directness, freedom from prejudice and frankness won her work great esteem in Sweden. Her last book was a biography (1892) of her friend Sofia Kovalevskaya, by way of introduction to Sonya's autobiography. An English translation (1895) by Annie de Furuhjelm and A. M. Clive Bayley contains a biographical note on Fr√§u Edgren-Leffler by Lily Wolffsohn, based on private sources.

A store in Albion was built in 1954. By 1962, the chain was also in Eaton Rapids, Marshall, and Mason. In 1971, the Felpausch chain expanded by buying former Harding's Market locations in Delton and Bronson, Michigan. The Bronson store was sold in 1982. Felpausch was run by the fifth generation of family members, and had been operating as an associate-owned company since 1995. A year later, it bought locations from South Haven-based Village Markets in Dowagiac, Paw Paw, and Benton Harbor. The Benton Harbor store, originally built as Jewel, was closed after only 10 months. A branch in Battle Creek was converted to an upscale prototype called Zucca's in 2004. Jackson, Michigan was reconfigured in 2006 to have an Ace Hardware franchise inside it. This store, also a former Jewel, opened in 1994 to replace two former Felpausch stores in the area: one on 20th Street and another on Goodale Avenue, both of which were previously Kroger and Hamady Brothers. The replacement closed in 2008. In March 2007, it was announced that Felpausch was being purchased by Grand Rapids, Michigan distributor and retailer, Spartan Stores (now SpartanNash). Spartan re-branded most of the locations D&W; Fresh Market or Family Fare. Charlotte was closed and converted to a health office by 2008.

He was one of the most important figures in Catholic intellectual life in the 20th century.  Life and work Guardini was born in Verona, Italy, in 1885. His family moved to Mainz when he was one year old and he lived in Germany for the rest of his life. He attended the Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium. Guardini wrote that as a young man he was ‚Äúalways anxious and very scrupulous.‚ÄùSmith, Nicholas Wolfram. \\"Romano Guardini, Beloved Theologian of Two Popes ‚Äî and Potential Saint\\", National Catholic Register, December 15, 2017 After studying chemistry in T√ºbingen for two semesters, and economics in Munich and Berlin for three, he decided to become a priest. After studying Theology in Freiburg im Breisgau and T√ºbingen, he was ordained in Mainz in 1910. He briefly worked in a pastoral position before returning to Freiburg to work on his doctorate in Theology under Engelbert Krebs. He received his doctorate in 1915 for a dissertation on Bonaventure. He completed his \\"Habilitation\\" in Dogmatic Theology at the University of Bonn in 1922, again with a dissertation on Bonaventure. Throughout this period he also worked as a chaplain to the Catholic youth movement. In 1923 he was appointed to a chair in Philosophy of Religion at the University of Berlin. In the 1935 essay \\"Der Heiland\\" (The Saviour) he criticized Nazi mythologizing of the person of Jesus and emphasized the Jewishness of Jesus. The Nazis forced him to resign from his Berlin position in 1939. From 1943 to 1945 he retired to Mooshausen, where his friend Josef Weiger had been parish priest since 1917. In 1945 Guardini was appointed professor in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of T√ºbingen and resumed lecturing on the Philosophy of Religion. In 1948, he became professor at the University of Munich, where he remained until retiring for health reasons in 1962. Guardini died in Munich, Bavaria on 1 October 1968. He was buried in the priests‚Äô cemetery of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Munich. His estate was left to the Catholic Academy in Bavaria that he had co-founded.  Reputation and influence  Guardini's books were often powerful studies of traditional themes in the light of present-day challenges or examinations of current problems as approached from the Christian, and especially Catholic, tradition. He was able to get inside such different worldviews as those of Socrates, Plato, Augustine, Dante, Pascal, Kierkegaard, Dostojevski and Nietzsche, and make sense of them for modern readers. His first major work, Vom Geist der Liturgie (The Spirit of the Liturgy), published during the First World War, was a major influence on the Liturgical Movement in Germany and by extension on the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council.Robert Anthony Krieg, Romano Guardini: A Precursor of Vatican II. University of Notre Dame Press, 1997. He is generally regarded as the father of the liturgical movement in Germany, and in his \\"Open Letter\\" of April 1964 to Mgr. Johannes Wagner, the organizer of the Third German Liturgical Congress in Mainz, he \\"raises important questions regarding the nature of the liturgical act in the wake of individualism, asking whether it is possible for twentieth-century Christians really to engage in worship. Is it possible to 'relearn a forgotten way of doing things and recapture lost attitudes', so as to enter into the liturgical experience?.\\" It was his glad hope that after the call by the Second Vatican Council for liturgical reform, the Church might shift its focus from that of mere ceremonial (though important) to the broader idea of true liturgical action, an act which \\"embraced not only a spiritual inwardness, but the whole man, body as well as spirit.\\" He himself gave an example of his meaning: A parish priest of the late 19th century once said (according to Guardini's illustration), \\"We must organize the procession better; we must see to it that the praying and singing is done better.\\" For Guardini, the parish priest had missed the point of what true liturgical action is. The questions he had asked should have been different. They should have been, \\"How can the act of walking become a religious act, a retinue for the Lord progressing through his land, so that an 'epiphany' may take place.\\" Pope Paul VI offered to make him a cardinal in 1965, but he declined. As a philosopher he founded no \\"school\\", but his intellectual disciples could in some sense be said to include Josef Pieper, Luigi Giussani, Felix Messerschmid, Heinrich Getzeny, Rudolf Schwarz, Jean Gebser, Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later Pope Francis). In the 1980s Bergoglio began work on a doctoral dissertation on Guardini, though he never completed it. Pope Francis cited Guardini's The End of the Modern World eight times in his 2015 encyclical Laudato si', more often than any other modern thinker who was not pope. Hannah Arendt and Iring Fetscher were favourably impressed by Guardini's work. He had a strong influence in Central Europe; in Slovenia, for example, an influential group of Christian socialists, among whom Edvard Kocbek, Pino Mlakar, Vekoslav Grmiƒç and Boris Pahor, incorporated Guardini's views in their agenda. Slovak philosopher and theologian Ladislav Hanus was strongly influenced in his works by Guardini, whom he met personally, and promoted his ideas in Slovakia, writing a short monograph.Hanus, Ladislav. Romano Guardini: Mysliteƒæ a pedag√≥g storoƒçia. L√öƒå, Bratislava, 1994. In 1952, Guardini won the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. The 1990s saw something of a revival of interest in his works and person. Several of his books were reissued in the original German and in English translation. In 1997 his remains were moved to the Sankt Ludwig Kirche, the University church in Munich, where he had often preached. Guardini's book The Lord, published in English translation in the late 1940s, remained in print for decadesIt was still in print as of 2012, with an Introduction by Pope Benedict XVI. and, according to publisher Henry Regnery, was \\"one of the most successful books I have ever published.\\" The novelist Flannery O'Connor thought it \\"very fine\\" and recommended it to a number of her friends.Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, The Habit of Being.

She made her first appearance in the show on 22 November 2005. The character left the show on 2 September 2008. Barton briefly reprised the role of Honey in 2014, appearing from 27 May to 6 June 2014, however, it was later confirmed in September 2015 that the character would be making a permanent return, and Honey returned full-time from 12 November 2015. She took a break in 2020, departing on 17 January. She returned in the episode broadcast on 24 September 2020. Initial storylines included a relationship and marriage with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), coping with her daughter Janet Mitchell (Grace) having down syndrome, being knocked down by a car before giving birth to Will Mitchell (Toby Walpole/Freddie Phillips) and her marriage breakdown and subsequent departure. Since her return, storylines have included a reconciliation with her ex- husband Billy, their daughter, Janet, being the victim of a hit and run, the breakdown of her relationship with Billy for a second time after he cheated on her with Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), a toxic relationship with her dentist Adam Bateman (Stephen Rahman-Hughes) which ended after he had a secret affair with Habiba Ahmed (Rukku Nahar) and several other women behind her back, which leaves her with low self esteem and suffering with bulimia. Storylines =2005‚Äì2008= Honey is introduced in November 2005, employed by Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) as a \\"honey trap\\" to see if her husband Patrick (Rudolph Walker) is willing to commit adultery. Honey causes confusion by mistaking Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) for Patrick, but truth prevails, and Honey and Billy become friends. Honey has aspirations to become a model. Billy helps her find employment, acting as her manager. Billy and Honey are attracted to each other, and after a period of trepidation, they finally confess their feelings and became a couple in December 2005. The following month, Honey falls pregnant. Overjoyed, Billy proposes and despite initial objections from her father, Jack Edwards (Nicky Henson), Honey says yes. When Jack discovers that Honey is pregnant, he tries to persuade her to abort her unborn child, convinced that she would share the same fate as her mother. Not wanting to lose Honey, Billy insists that she enquire about an abortion but a check-up reveals that Honey does not have the same heart defect as her mother, so there is no danger of her dying of the same cause. Honey is furious with Jack for making her so unnecessarily fearful about her health all her life, and chastises him for not getting her heart checked when she was a child. She eventually forgives her father, and begins enjoying the prospect of becoming a mother. Honey and Billy's first attempt at getting married in June 2006 ends in disaster when Honey is admitted to hospital, due to food poisoning. They try again in July, but due to a series of unfortunate events ‚Äî starting with a prank performed on Billy's stag night ‚Äî the groom doesn't get to the ceremony on time. Their third attempt in September is arranged as a surprise by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Honey is heavily pregnant and goes into labour, during the ceremony. As Billy leans in for a kiss after they are pronounced husband and wife, Honey reveals that her waters have broken. Honey gives birth to a girl, Janet (named after Honey's mother), but her happiness is short- lived when she discovers that Janet has Down syndrome. Devastated, Honey rejects her baby, changing her name to Petal, as she does not have the \\"perfect\\" Janet she had wanted. Honey and Billy go to a support group for parents of children with Down syndrome, but this depresses Honey further. She breaks down and destroys Petal's nursery, admitting to Billy that she wants to put Petal up for adoption. Billy is against this and their relationship suffers as a result. Honey tries, but cannot accept her baby and at her lowest ebb, considers smothering Petal with a pillow, but cannot do it. Petal is fostered by Tony (Enzo Squillino, Jr.) and Kim Smith (Lorraine Arnold) in December 2006, but the next day, Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) tells Billy that Petal needs a heart operation. Billy arranges for Petal to be baptised in case she does not survive, and after reading a heartfelt letter from Billy to Petal, Honey decides to keep her daughter after all. She attends the baptism and informs the vicar that the baby's name is Janet. Janet's operation is a success, and Honey begins to bond with her. In March 2007, Honey discovers she is pregnant again. Billy is apprehensive, fearing that they might love the new baby more than Janet, but Honey soon reassures him and they look forward to the arrival of the second baby. However, in November 2007, Honey is knocked down whilst trying to stop Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) being attacked, sending her into labour. She is rushed to hospital where she gives birth to a boy, who initially appears stillborn, but is resuscitated, and is named William after his father. The Mitchells are happy until December 2007, when their landlady, Manju Patel (Leena Dhingra), threatens to evict them. Billy is unable to raise their rent money and despite attempts to barricade themselves in the flat, Mrs. Patel evicts them, leaving the entire family homeless before Christmas. They are forced to rely on relatives and friends for accommodation, before being rehoused at Walford Towers. Money becomes an issue for the Mitchells again in August 2008. Desperate, Billy takes a job as a getaway driver for Jase, who is in league with Terry Bates (Nicholas Ball), the man responsible for the pub riot that caused Honey an injury the year before. The job is a ruse, set up by Terry as revenge on Jase; Jase is stabbed and killed. Honey is devastated to learn that Billy was indirectly involved in the incident that led to Jase's death, particularly when she discovers that instead of trying to rescue Jase, Billy hid in the bathroom in fear. She is further incensed to discover that Billy has kept Jase's \\"blood money\\". She throws Billy out, only agreeing to take him back when Billy donates the money to charity. Honey tells Billy she will take him back if he promises never to lie again. Billy does so, but when Honey discovers that Billy still has some of Jase's money, she decides that she can no longer trust him. She ends her marriage and leaves Walford with their children on 2 September 2008. Honey tells Billy that she will never stop him seeing the kids because she does not want to see them suffer because of their father's mistakes. In September 2008, it is revealed that Honey and the children are now living with Honey's father, Jack. In May 2010, it is mentioned that Honey and Jack have been involved in a car crash, and Billy is given temporary custody of Janet and William. Jack dies and Honey is left in a critical condition. It is then revealed that Honey has recovered, and has resumed custody of Janet and William. =2014‚Äì= Honey brings the children to visit Billy and asks to meet up with him. Billy assumes it is a date and confesses his love, however Honey reveals that she wants to move to Canada for a year and take the children. Billy vows to stop her, he destroys Janet's passport and abducts her and William, but Phil convinces him to return. Honey agrees to let Janet stay with him while she takes William. She returns again to visit Billy the next year, and goes back to his flat to see Janet, but discovers Billy has stolen items in his flat (which he had moved for his cousin Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). He convinces her that he has changed, and after she listens to a voicemail message he has left for her, they have sex. Honey discovers that William's modelling contract has not been renewed and decides to move back to Walford. She then opens up to Les Coker (Roger Sloman), about not wanting to move too quickly in her relationship with Billy. Honey asks Billy to speak to Ronnie about loaning them some money so she can move into a flat nearby with Janet and William. After Billy reveals why he needs money from her, Ronnie suggests Honey and the children move in with her and her son, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, so that she is no longer alone. Honey agrees to this and they move in the following day. Honey and Billy soon get engaged again. Honey is horrified to learn that Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), who lives with her and Billy, has been dealing drugs and that Billy knew this, evicting them both. She later forgives Billy and agrees to help Jay. Honey and Billy catch Jay stealing their wedding fund, so Honey reports Jay to the police and he decides to move out so that Janet and William will not go into care. Honey comforts Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) when his wife Ronnie and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) drown on Ronnie and Jack's wedding day. Billy and Honey move into the flat above the funeral parlour where Billy works, and he is made a partner in the business. Honey is devastated when Janet is hit by a car and after arguing with Billy, he has sex with Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), who was driving the car. Billy is sacked for illegally exhuming a grave, and Honey sees Billy and Tina hugging after she supports him. Honey assumes they are having an affair so Billy admits to a one-night stand. Billy and Honey split over it, leaving Billy homeless. Tina's plan for Billy to get Honey drunk, so they might get back together, backfires when she flirts with Jack instead, and when Honey nearly kisses Jack, he in turn is attacked by Billy, who then tells Honey that their relationship is special and he wants to get back together, but she vomits because of the alcohol. All attempts to reconcile fail, because she cannot forgive him for cheating on her. Honey struggles to pay her rent, so she, Janet and William move in to a house share with Billy. Billy cooks Honey a special dinner hoping it will start a reunion, but she cracks a tooth on an olive stone. She sees a dentist, Adam Bateman (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), which leads to series of dates. Billy is jealous and gives the children sweets because it is bad for their teeth, but it just leads to William vomiting on Honey. Billy later deletes messages from Adam on Honey's phone but she then changes her PIN, saying she will not let Billy spoil her time with Adam, and their relationship continues. Adam starts an affair with Habiba Ahmed (Rukku Nahar), and when Habiba's sister Iqra (Priya Davdra) learns of this, she tells Honey. Despite knowing about the affair, Honey continues her relationship with Adam due to the fear of being unhappy. As part of a \\"wife swap\\" event in Walford, doctor Ash Kaur (Gurlaine Kaur Garcha) stays with Honey for a few days. During her time with Honey, Ash notices symptoms of an eating disorder, and confronts her on it. Honey reveals that she began dealing with it in her teens, but it became manageable when she had kids. However, it reappeared when she began seeing Adam, and Ash tells her to seek professional help. Also during the swap, Iqra stays with Adam, where she finds out that he is seeing other woman behind Honey's back. Honey exposes Adam in the Queen Vic, before kicking him out of their flat after he mocks her bulimia, leading to her attacking him with a recycling box. For several weeks afterwards, Honey struggles with her bulimia, and eventually decides she must leave Walford and move in with her aunt while she seeks treatment for her eating disorder. Character creation and development Actress Emma Barton was chosen to play Honey Edwards in September 2005, after a successful screen test with Perry Fenwick. Barton commented, \\"I can‚Äôt wait to join EastEnders and play Honey. She‚Äôs a really sweet girl, who always wants to do the best for everyone but she‚Äôs not exactly the brightest star in the sky.\\" Barton was axed from the show in April 2008. The character is widely known as Honey, though the character's \\"real\\" name is Susan, which is sometimes used in the series. =Down syndrome= A relationship between Honey and Billy quickly developed in late 2005 and, within two months, an upcoming baby had been written into the characters' narratives, with Honey announcing she was pregnant in January 2006. The pregnancy was the start of an ongoing storyline about Down syndrome (DS) as, in September 2006, Honey and Billy's baby Janet was diagnosed with the disorder shortly after her birth. EastEnders' producers began to work on the DS plot in February 2006. Real parents with Down syndrome children were approached to act as consultants in the making of the storyline, meeting with writers and the actors who play Billy and Honey. On-screen, Honey was shown to be devastated, rejecting her baby and wanting to have her adopted, while Billy wanted to keep his daughter, placing strain on the couple, who married in the serial the day of Janet's birth. The Down's Syndrome Association (DSA) worked with EastEnders on the storyline. Their medical advisers were consulted about possible health problems that Billy and Honey's baby might encounter. According to the DSA in 2006, DS people are under-represented on mainstream television and EastEnders helped to redress that imbalance. The DSA used their influence to change certain elements of the scripts that they were unhappy with, such as persuading them to change the way Billy and Honey were told of their baby's diagnosis; however, they had no influence over the characters' reactions or the plot in general. For the first two weeks after Janet's diagnosis, the DSA provided a helpline for worried parents or anyone wanting advice about DS. EastEnders also provided a link to the DSA website from theirs, to ensure that people looking for information could find the association. The storyline was developed with characterisation in mind. Some characters, such as Peggy Mitchell, were shown to respond negatively towards the DS baby, views that were included so that the positive aspects could be voiced by the \\"more enlightened characters\\". The programme makers' main priority was to show the reality of having a child with the condition, \\"with all of its positives and negatives\\" and to \\"create awareness among thousands of people who know very little about Down syndrome, who might have out-dated or prejudiced views.\\" EastEnders took advice from DS organisations and families of DS people throughout. Care was taken to ensure that viewers empathised with Billy and Honey, to portray their journey in a \\"realistic way\\". The DSA have expressed their desire to see a Down syndrome character becoming a permanent member of the EastEnders cast, as in their opinion \\"it would be a fantastic opportunity to bring Down syndrome into mainstream awareness, and to present a 21st century picture of family life for those who have children with the condition.\\" In 2006, EastEnders pledged that they intended for Billy and Honey's baby to grow up as any other baby would in the soap; however, it has been noted that the plot is dependent on the actors involved, and other practical problems that could arise. EastEnders pledged to make every effort to portray \\"a positive image of a family who have a baby with the condition.\\" Reception of Down syndrome storyline The episodes received criticism for inaccuracy. Sue Jacob, a teacher at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said EastEnders presented a \\"poor picture of midwifery practice\\". During Janet's birth, Honey was refused an epidural while in pain, and later she was told that her baby had Down syndrome alone, without her partner or family there to support her. Jacob commented, \\"Women are vulnerable after giving birth and they need support systems in place [...] The person caring for her is repeatedly referred to as a nurse in the episode but there is no way that a nurse would be in charge after birth. The midwife would also have been open and honest and said 'We need to get the baby checked out and we will get your partner' [...] What the soaps do is set scenes which prompt people to talk about things which are affecting their lives. We are concerned people will wrongly think this Down‚Äôs syndrome story shows what really happens, and that if you have a problem there is no one there to support you. Showing something like this is not helpful.\\" Furthermore, Jacob noted that Honey was left alone for a long time to worry about the baby, which appeared rigid, and not floppy, as Down syndrome babies do. In Jacob's opinion, a midwife would have been repeatedly in and out of the room to check on the mother. Additionally, one episode showed a health visitor reprimanding Honey for refusing Down syndrome screening and Karen Reay, director of the Community Practitioners‚Äô and Health Visitors‚Äô Association called the episode \\"insensitive and patronising\\". She added that the episode contained \\"glaring anomalies\\", giving new mothers a \\"fictitious and misleading\\" view of health visitors, which could \\"damage relationships with health professionals\\". The BBC responded by saying, \\"EastEnders has undertaken a great deal of research to script the storyline of Billy and Honey giving birth to their baby daughter. EastEnders takes enormous care with its research and takes advice from experts in the given field. In addition, for this particular storyline EastEnders talked to numerous families with children who have Down syndrome. Some of their experiences were depicted in these early episodes. Also closely involved was a senior midwife from a large UK general hospital who saw all scripts. In relation to some particular points raised, Honey was not denied an epidural ‚Äì she made the choice to put herself out of reach of communicating effectively with the midwife by locking herself in the bathroom. When the news was broken to Honey and Billy that their baby had Down syndrome, EastEnders has in fact drawn directly from one particular true-life story ‚Äì and while this may indeed not be best practice it is worth saying that good drama does not necessarily come from best practice.\\" Despite the BBC's \\"extensive search\\" to cast a real baby with Down syndrome for the birth episodes, they were unable to do so, resulting in the shots of the newborn baby being less authentic and limited. The BBC added, \\"In the coming weeks Honey and Billy's child will be played by a baby with Down Syndrome. It is worth noting that EastEnders has received incredibly positive feedback from the Down's Syndrome Association following the first few episodes, whom we are continuing to work with very closely.\\" Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, has confirmed that 40% of parents whose babies were diagnosed after birth were given no written or practical information about the condition, and 11% were told, as Honey was, by a midwife rather than a paediatrician: \\"The way in which Billy and Honey have learnt of their baby's disability, and their subsequent support from their health professionals, is not a best-practice model. However, neither is it an unrealistic situation. BBC researchers and scriptwriters have based the scenes on conversations with families who have children with Down syndrome, and the scenes have struck a chord with thousands of our parent members across the country. Some health professionals hold outdated or prejudiced views about people with Down Syndrome that prevent them from giving parents a balanced picture of what the future will hold for them.\\" =Reintroduction= On 27 May 2014, Honey returned to EastEnders with her children to visit Billy. The character appeared in the episode without any prior publicity to offer viewers an element of surprise, though Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins warned fans via his Twitter account that the episode would feature surprises. Frances Taylor of Digital Spy revealed that Barton had reprised the role on a temporary basis. Kilkelly later revealed that Honey's return involves her informing Billy of her plans to move overseas. But Billy is unwilling to let her take his children away. A spokesperson told him that Billy will stop at nothing to keep his family nearby, but will his next move make everything worse?\\" On 6 September 2015, it was announced that Honey would be returning to EastEnders as a permanent character later in the year, following Barton's decision to reprise the role full-time following her brief return the year before. Honey made her on-screen return on 12 November 2015. Reception In September 2006, Steve Frost, head producer of EastEnders' rival soap Coronation Street, publicly branded Honey and the Down syndrome storyline as \\"Painful to watch [...] wooden and emotionless ‚Äì crap.\\" EastEnders' executive producer, Kate Harwood, defended the storyline, saying \\"We had incredible feedback on our Down's storyline. Fans were moved.\\" Grace Dent, television critic for The Guardian, described the trio of \\"doomed weddings\\" between Billy and Honey in 2006 as an excuse to watch other television programmes \\"without ever feeling adrift from the Walford gossip [...] It was like Groundhog Day in a Pronuptia showroom. After a series of unfortunate events, the wedding would be scuppered. Honey would sob, Billy would do one of his \\"I try so hard to do the right thing\\" soliloquys and everyone in the Vic would be forcing down marzipan-coated fruit cake for weeks.\\" Referencing the surprise third wedding when Honey was heavily pregnant, Dent said, \\"No one said that springing acute stress on Honey, a heavily pregnant woman, was plainly daft [...] each 30-minute episode spent with Honey and Billy now felt like an endurance test.\\" She has also described the coupling of Billy and Honey as akin to Billy and his former wife in the serial Little Mo Mitchell, saying \\"It's Billy and Little Mo all over again. Two dim-witted people, week-in, week-out, making lots of mistakes and getting the wrong end of the stick with farcical consequences. Everyone else is doing Brecht-lite, they're doing Terry & June [...] They're what the fast-forward 30x option on the Sky+ was made for.\\" The scenes in which Honey was attacked were subject to heavy criticism in 2007, with Ofcom receiving 78 complaints from viewers about the level of violence displayed, and concerns for the safety of her baby. The media regulatory body stated that: \\"In Ofcom's view the violence was not appropriately limited for this time of the evening when many children are available to view television.\\" EastEnders was found to have breached the broadcasting code on this occasion, though the BBC defended itself by stating that there had been a gradual buildup to the event over several episodes, and that a content warning was aired prior to the episode's broadcast.

Its popularity began in the 1970s with the emergence of the punk and glam rock movements: the Sex Pistols' first television appearance occurred with a person of their entourage wearing a swastika.\\"Today Show - Bill Grundy\\" ITV. December 1976. Retrieved 3 April 2011. Nazi chic was later used in the fashion industry. Popular usage In the surf culture of the 1950s and 1960s, \\"Surf Nazis\\" would experiment with Nazi aesthetics, such as swastikas and Nazi helmets, and sometimes paint swastikas on their cars. Their motivation was often anti-establishment rebelliousness, rather than genuine sympathy with the Nazis. American artist Ed Roth sold plastic Nazi stormtrooper helmets to surfers in the 1960s, and told Time magazine, ‚ÄúThat Hitler really did a helluva public relations job for me.‚Äù In the 1960s, some filmmakers looking for edgy and controversial ideas incorporated Nazi themes into their works for shock value, with the 1965 film Censored described as having \\"the dubious honor of being the very first skinflick to mix Nazis and naked women\\" In the early 1970s, glam rock acts incorporated nazi symbolism into their works, often for the shock value and outrageousness. Steve Priest, of the glam rock band The Sweet, wore a nazi uniform and fake toothbrush moustache in a December 1973 live performance of Ballroom Blitz, on Top of the Pops. In the 1970s punk subculture, several items of clothing designed to shock and offend the Establishment became popular. Among these punk fashion items was a T-shirt displaying a Swastika, an upside-down crucifix and the word DESTROY‚Äì which was worn by Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, seen in the video for \\"Pretty Vacant\\". Rotten wore the swastika another time with a gesture that looked like a Nazi salute. In 1976, Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees was also known to wear a Swastika armband with fetish S and M clothing, including fishnets and a whip. These musicians are commonly thought to have worn such clothing for shock value directed towards the British WWII generation rather than being genuinely associated with any National Socialist or fascist ideologies, and those with such interests likely became part of the Nazi punk or white power skinhead subcultures. In 1984, two T-shirt designs featuring Adolf Hitler were produced in West Germany. The more famous of the two was the \\"Adolf Hitler European Tour\\" design, which featured a picture of Hitler against the backdrop of a map of Europe, with conquered territories shaded; and tour dates given as: *September 1939 Poland *April 1940 Norway *May 1940 Luxembourg *May 1940 Holland *May 1940 Belgium *June 1940 France * ~~September 1940 England~~ Cancelled *April 1941 Jugoslavia *May 1941 Greece *June 1941 Crete *A ~~ugust 1942 Russia~~ Cancelled *July 1945 Berlin Bunker. A less popular T-shirt featured Hitler giving the Roman salute, and a yo-yo hanging from his hand. The text read \\"European yo-yo champion 1939-1945\\". Sale of the apparel led to a legal case in Germany, in an attempt to have it banned as \\"glorifying genocide\\". Local courts ruled against the shirt makers, although Bavarian state courts later ruled in their favor. In 1988, Ralph Engelstad was criticized for a party he held at his Imperial Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas featuring bartenders wearing the \\"European Tour\\" shirts. In 1990, the ACLU represented a high school student on Long Island who was told to remove the shirt or face suspension by school officials who claimed the shirt was anti-semitic. In an interview with Welt am Sonntag, Bryan Ferry, the English singer and musician, acknowledged that he calls his studio in west London his \\"F√ºhrerbunker\\". He was quoted as saying, \\"My God, the Nazis knew how to put themselves in the limelight and present themselves. ... Leni Riefenstahl's movies and Albert Speer's buildings and the mass parades and the flags - just amazing. Really beautiful.\\" (Later Ferry denied ever making this statement, and the newspapers printed a rectification.) The American glam metal band M√∂tley Cr√ºe inserted in the booklet of the album M√∂tley Cr√ºe (1994) an image of Nikki Sixx dressed as a Nazi. Officially, the photo was related to lyrics about judging by appearances, but in actuality was inserted to mock the media. The discographer decided to cancel that photo and to reprint the whole booklet. In the M√∂tley Cr√ºe autobiography, The Dirt, the band writes about their \\"Nazi Wednesdays\\", in which they used to walk down the street dressed in Nazi uniforms. English rock musician Lemmy of the band Mot√∂rhead collected Nazi memorabilia and had an Iron Cross on his bass guitar, but stated that he collected these memorabilia for aesthetic values only, and considered himself an anarchist or libertarian. In early 2005, a designer using the pseudonym \\"Helmut Doork\\" began marketing a parody souvenir T-shirt with the slogans \\"My grandparents went to Auschwitz and all I got was this lousy t-shirt!\\" and \\"Arbeit Macht Frei.\\" In response to a complaint from the Anti-Defamation League, the design was removed from CafePress' website in late 2006. The creator later uploaded it to Printfection. After Printfection removed it without explanation the creator then released it into the public domain, giving anyone permission to print and/or commercialize the design without permission. Prince Harry was criticized for wearing a costume with a swastika armbandHarry says sorry for Nazi costume BBC News, January 13, 2005 causing considerable embarrassment to his family. He later issued a public statement apologizing for his actions, but his lack of apology in person angered some groups. Harry's impromptu costume resembled the Afrika Korps, rather than more political units such as the SS. Writer Moyra Bremner commented on BBC News 24 that no one had stopped the prince wearing the costume.Harry public apology 'not needed' BBC News, January 14, 2005 Alternative hip hop group OFWGKTA uses the swastika symbol and makes references to Nazism in its lyrics.The Past, the Present, and the Odd Future Huffington Post, January 11, 2011 Nazi chic fashion can be seen in the music videos for Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\" (1990), Marilyn Manson's \\"The Fight Song\\" (2001) and Lady Gaga's \\"LoveGame\\" (2009).  Asia  Uniforms and other imagery related to Nazi Germany are sold in East and South East Asia, where some consider it fashionable. Hong Kong and Japan have each witnessed a growth in the casual wearing of SS uniforms, as well as increased interest in White power music. Sometimes in East Asia, Nazi uniforms are used as part of cosplay.Le Nazi chic, la nouvelle mode qui fascine de jeunes Chinois (french) In South Korea, an area generally isolated from Nazi cultural influences during the Nazi era, Time magazine observed in 2000 \\"an unthinking fascination with the icons and imagery of the Third Reich.\\" In Indonesia, the SoldatenKaffee, a caf√© featuring nazi decoration and memorabilia closed in 2013 due to controversies and critiques by international media as well as death threats and hate mail to the owners.

This type of education treats Hitler and the Nazi Party as charismatic and powerful leaders of countries during wartime, instead of war criminals as elsewhere. George Burdi, the former head of the neo-Nazi record label Resistance Records, claimed to have sold many CDs to Japan, because some Japanese believe themselves to be the master race of the East. In Turkey, Hitler's book Mein Kampf became a best-seller in early 2005 following price cuts and rising Turkish nationalism.

The village is situated approximately north of Horncastle and just to the east of the A153. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 255.  History  The village's history dates back to the Romans and the Vikings. In 1536, during the Reformation, the vicar of Belchford was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason, after leading a rebellion against the crown.  Geography  Steep hills and deep valleys surround the village. Belchford lies in the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty running from Louth in the north, to Horncastle in the south. The village attracts ramblers, and hang-gliders who use the ridges from the Bluestone Heath Road to launch into the valley. The Viking Way, a national long distance footpath, passes through Belchford by the Blue Bell Inn, on its way from the Humber in the north to Rutland in the south.

The event attracts approximately 50 competing teams from around the UK and is combined with a craft fair with other attractions for children. Spectator turnout for the event is generally about 3,000 = South Wold Hunt = The South Wold Hunt is based near Belchford. The hunt was founded in 1823 by the Hon. George Pelham (the younger brother to Lord Yarborough). In the mid-1850s the hunt built kennels at Belchford. During the Second World War the Agricultural Executive occupied the kennels and so the country was temporarily split with the hounds kennelled at Aswardby on the eastern side and Edlington Hall on the western side. The pack were united again in the 1948-49 season when the hounds returned to the kennels at Belchford where they remain today. The South Wold Hounds are hunted every Saturday and most Tuesdays throughout the season, over a varied country which includes part of the Lincolnshire Wolds and the Marsh. The country extends from Market Rasen Racecourse in the north-west to the coast in the east. Woodhall Spa is at the south-west of the Hunt's country. =Landmarks= The Grade II listed parish church of Belchford is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul The original church was built before 1153,\\"Belchford\\", Genuki.org.uk.

At the time of its completion, it was the tallest commercial building in Montreal with the first eight floors were designed for retail office space, that quickly filled with the city's best lawyers and financiers. When the clock tower was completed, the owner filled the ninth and tenth floors with the largest legal library in the entire country as a gift to tenants. The building is next to another historic office tower, Aldred Building. History New York Life Insurance Building in the late Nineteenth or early Twentieth Century. The New York Life Insurance Building was built by architects Babb, Cook and Willard and contractor Peter Lyall for the New York Life Insurance Company as its office in Canada. The final cost was $750,000. The Old Red Sandstone used in the construction was imported from Dumfriesshire, Scotland. New York Life selected the site on Place D‚ÄôArmes because it was near the Montreal business hub. Before construction began, crews demolished l‚ÄôHotel Compain and another 2 story building that occupied the lots. The building first appeared on 1890 insurance map. Quebec Bank purchased the building in 1909 and occupied the ground floor before being absorbed into the Royal Bank of Canada in 1917. The structure still bears the bank's name carved over the entrance. The building is near Place-d'Armes Metro, and is adjacent to other prominent Montreal landmarks, such as the Aldred Building (1931), the Bank of Montreal Building (1859/1901), the Place d'Armes Hotel, Notre-Dame Basilica and 500 Place D'Armes. Architecture View of the building from across Place d'Armes, taken in mid 1970s. The New York Life Building was inspired by Italian Renaissance and buildings in New York and was one of the first major Montreal buildings which did not use the local grey stone but instead used imported red sandstone. The stone required cutting which was done in Lyall workshop located on Bishop Street. The building has a ‚Äúhybrid structure combining a frame - iron beams, girders and two sets of columns per floor - and bearing walls brick.‚Äù Architects used steel to construct the floors and the roof but employed masonry walls to support the structure. Henry Beaumont carved the significant external decorative elements such as the arabesque in the entrance archway, spandrel panels and pilaster capitals. The ornamental iron gate is by the E. Chanteloup workshop in Montreal. The building contains eight floors and has a height of including the clock tower. It has a quasi-rectangular shape and has a land area of Total floor area including all floors is Interior walls in the small vestibule and the halls are covered in marble and the ceiling has a decorative plaster resembling Renaissance ornamentation. The staircase railing consists of ornamental iron with a finished wood banister. The office building is located on a corner lot and has fa√ßade on Place D‚ÄôArmes as well as on rue Saint-Jacques. The original address was 13 Place d‚ÄôArmes Hills but was later changed to its current address 511 Place D‚ÄôArmes. Owners modernized the third, fourth and fifth floors in 1952, and renovated the basement in 1970. In 1971, they added stairs between fifth floor and the roof. Subsequent owners completed further renovations in the 1980s and undertook an additional restoration project in 2006-2007 which included adding two residential penthouses on the roof. One of these is occupied by the current building owner. Owners Name carved on the entrance. Note the reverse \\"Q\\" in \\"Quebec\\". The building‚Äôs original name was New York Life Building but in 1909 became home of Quebec Bank. The building was also known as Bank of Quebec building and Montreal Trust building but still is referred to by its original name. The building has changed hands many times and had a number of notable tenants, including the Montreal Real Trust Company, London and Lancashire Insurance Co., the National Bank of Canada and the Soci√©t√© de Fiducie du Quebec. The Soci√©t√© de Fiducie du Quebec occupied the building for six years and sold it to Les immeubles Bona Lt√©e who performed many upgrades to the building.

It is easily distinguishable from any other member of Gallotia by the intense white colour that covers its neck, chest and area around the mouth, in spectacular contrast to its dark brown back. This lizard is generally diurnal and mostly herbivorous, and grows up to half a metre long (head and body long). The females lay a single clutch annually of three to seven eggs on average. Its population trend has actually been increasing since 2001. Status and conservation Apparent La Gomera giant lizards are listed in reports on La Gomera up to the 19th century, but not thereafter. The species was originally described from subfossil remains in 1985, presumably having gone extinct by then. Spanish biologists led by Juan Carlos Rando rediscovered this species in 1999. The biologists found only six living individuals. The current population of the La Gomera giant lizard consists of (2004) 90 individuals remaining in the wild, and a captive stock of about 44 animals. This species is now only known from two separate inaccessible cliffs 2 km apart, close to the Valle Gran Rey. The La Gomera giant lizard is thought to have once ranged throughout much of La Gomera and in many habitat types. Nowadays it is found in the Parque Rural de Valle Gran Rey, and the present range is less than one hectare and is restricted to dry cliffs with sparse vegetation. The La Gomera Giant Lizard is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List. The species historically declined through overgrazing, hunting, and predation by feral cats and rats. Nowadays the main threats are predation by feral cats, and rock falls within its restricted range. The species is protected by international legislation, and a species recovery plan is in place. On La Gomera, a captive breeding programme has been established in order to increase the number of individuals. To ensure the survival of the remaining populations and facilitate eventual reintroductions, the feral cat population around the species' range will need to be controlled. Taxonomy and systematics In his scientific description, the German zoologist R. Hutterer referred the subfossil remains from La Gomera to two subspecies of Gallotia simonyi with the differences being size related. He named these Gallotia simonyi bravoana and Gallotia simonyi gomerana. Bischoff (1998) synonymized them to a single taxon. Barbadillo et al. (1999) decided for bravoana when they elevated the taxon to species rank. Nogales et al. (2001) concurred as regards species status, but used Gallotia gomerana. Following the ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, gomerana is a junior synonym or bravoana. It is not unequivocally accepted that it does constitute a distinct species; however, in all likelihood, G. simonyi is its closest living relative.

Little was the first woman in United States history to be acquitted using the defense that she used deadly force to resist sexual assault.Pickard et al., 2002:885 Her case also has become classic in legal circles as a pioneering instance of the application of scientific jury selection.Abramson 2000:160 Early life Little was born and raised until age 15 in Washington, a town of under 10,000 in North Carolina's rural Atlantic coastal region. Her mother, Jessie Williams was a \\"religious fanatic\\" who frequently consulted \\"root workers,\\"Reston 1977 or hoodoo folk healers. Her father was a security guard in Brooklyn, New York. The eldest of six blood siblings, she was forced to care for them and her four half-siblings as well. She took to running away and hiding and soon fell in with an older crowd who supported her rebellion. Her social worker, Jean Nelson, who once called her an \\"escape artist,\\" also noted her intelligence, telling her \\"some day you could do a lot of good.\\" As a teenager, she worked in the tobacco industry and as a waitress. In 1973, she went to work with a sheetrock finisher named Julius Rogers, whom she later accompanied to Greenville and later to Chapel Hill, where she would become entangled with the law.  Criminality  Little's problems with the law began in 1968, when her mother asked a judge to declare her a truant and to commit her to the Dobbs Farm Training School in Kinston, North Carolina. After a few weeks at Dobbs, Little fled, walking to a nearby service station where she and a friend hitched a ride back to Washington. Her mother realized she had not been duly released and so sought to legitimize her daughter's situation by procuring an official release. She later sent Joan to live with relatives in Philadelphia. Three weeks after graduating from high school there, Joan developed a thyroid problem and returned to North Carolina for an operation. In December 1973 and January 1974, Little, now 20, incurred a spate of arrests for theft and eventually for breaking and entering, with escalating legal consequences. In the coastal town of Jacksonville, North Carolina at the end of 1973, she was charged with the possession of stolen goods and the possession of a sawed-off shotgun, but was not prosecuted. On January 3, 1974, she was arrested in Washington, North Carolina for shoplifting. That charge, too was dismissed. Six days later, she was again arrested for shoplifting, a charge for which she was given a suspended six-month sentence. Six days after her release, she was again arrested and charged with three separate counts of felony breaking and entering and larceny. Her trial was set for June 3 and she left town in the interim. Her brother Jerome Little, was like Joan's partner for certain break ins and other string of criminalized offenses that lead her to be imprisoned in 1974. She returned to Washington in time for the trial, accompanied by Julius Rogers and two juveniles. The juveniles ended up in jail, where they were sexually harassed by a guard who offered them freedom if one of them would \\"give him some.\\" Little was convicted on June 4, 1974, and asked to remain in the county jail rather than be transferred to the Correctional Facility for Women in Raleigh, as would have been customary. Remaining in Washington, she said, would allow her to remain close to home, where she could work on raising her bond.  Trial for murder  = Slaying of a jailer = Nearly three months later, before dawn on August 27, 1974, a police officer delivering a drunken prisoner to the Beaufort County jail discovered the body of jailer Clarence Alligood, 62, on Joan Little's bunk, naked from the waist down. Alligood had suffered stab wounds to the temple and the heart area from an icepick. Semen was discovered on his leg. Little was missing. She turned herself in to North Carolina authorities more than one week later, and said that she had killed Alligood while defending herself against sexual assault.Time, 25 Aug 1975 Clarence Alligood had a record of forcing female inmates to take part in sexual favors as payment for gifts he'd give the inmates earlier. Other inmates had come forward and stated that he had given them gifts in the form of snacks and magazines and expected to receive sexual favors. Since Little had fled from prison she was known as a fugitive and the ability to kill her on sight was targeted on her, due to this Little turned herself in at Raleigh. Little was on trial for murder and was facing the North Carolina gas chamber. Little had found refugee in the home of an older black man from her community as well as had received offers to seek refuge in other countries. 98 percent of staff-on-inmate sexual assault is male staff against female inmates. = Charged with first degree murder = She was charged with first degree murder, which carried an automatic death sentence. The capital status of the case, and the fact that North Carolina was home to over one third of all the death penalty cases in the United States, drew the attention of anti-death penalty and prisoners' rights advocates. During the time of Joan Little's trial there were two other women of color facing the death penalty. Little's trial brought attention to her being the first women of color to cite self-defense during sexual assault against an accusation of murder. The racial component drew the attention of civil rights activists, and the gender component drew the attention of feminists. The combination of these three factors, along with sophisticated fundraising tactics, allowed the Joan Little Defense Committee to raise over $350,000. Jerry Paul and Karen Bethea-Shields (Karen Galloway) were her attorneys. The question of whether or not black people were treated equally by the criminal justice systems in the American South drew the attention of the national media.  Women on death row  From 1973 to the end of 2017, 184 women have been sentenced to death row in the United States. Sixteen were sentenced to death in North Carolina, with only three still remaining on death row since 2013. From 1976 to 2016 sixteen women have been executed for murder. Since the 1900s 54 women have been executed. Out of 165 inmates exonerated since March 2019, only two were females. = The trial = The defense team made crucial use of applied social science, including the new method of scientific jury selection, which had just come into existence in 1972.Abramson 2000:147 The defense commissioned surveys with a view to comparing popular attitudes among white people toward black people between Beaufort and Pitt Counties, in the state's northeast, and the north central area of the state. The results showed that unfavorable racial stereotypes were more strongly held in Beaufort County. For example, about two-thirds of the respondents in Beaufort and Pitt Counties believed that black women were lewder than white women and that black people were more violent than white people.Abramson 2000:161 Armed with this information, Paul successfully petitioned to have the trial moved to the state capital of Raleigh. At trial, the prosecution contended that Little was a lewd woman who seduced Alligood only to murder him to enable her escape. In two days of testimony, Little testified that Alligood, who at well over 200 pounds was nearly twice her size,McGuire, D. L. (2011). At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power. Vintage Books. had come to her cell three times between 10:00 pm and 3:00 am to solicit sex, finally forcing her at the point of an ice pick to perform oral sex. She testified she was able to seize the ice pick while he was seated on her bunk because he had let his guard down in the moments after his orgasm. She stabbed him repeatedly, and she testified he resisted fiercely and wrestled her, but that given his wounded state, she had been able to get free of him. Attorney Jerry Paul made liberal use of the jury's Southern Christian sympathies, characterizing his client as a religious woman who found solace in the Bible in times of trouble. William Griffin was the prosecutor who had concluded that Little had lured the 62-year-old jailer so she could escape. When the autopsy came back, it was concluded that Little's explanation of the incident was true. The autopsy concluded that the eleven stab wounds given to Alligood were in self-defense. Only one stab had been a fatal one, while the other ten were clear signs of self-defense against an attacker. The jury of six whites and six African Americans deliberated for one hour and 25 minutes and rendered a verdict of not guilty. Among them were Jennie Lancaster, Pecola Jones, and 26-year-old jury spokesperson Mark Neilsen. Jerry Paul, had Joan Little walk around in front of publicity with the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The Free Joan campaigns were successful enough that Joan's counsel were able to get the first-degree murder charge reduced to second degree. Judge Hobgood noted that the prosecution did not have liable evidence. Joan Little was returned to prison to serve the remainder of her sentence for breaking and entering. One month before she would have been eligible for parole, she made an escape. She was caught and then convicted and sentenced for the escape. She was freed in June 1979 and moved to New York City.New York Times, 26 Feb 1989 = Legacy of trial = Joan Little was the first woman to be acquitted of murder committed in self-defense against a sexual assault. African American women were given the right to sexual-assault defense against their Anglo-white male assaulter/rapist. This was all possible with the campaign that stood behind Ms. Little during the full trial. Joan Little's trial attracted the attention of many political activists, including Angela Davis; Rosa Parks, who formed a local chapter for Little's defense; and Katherine Galloway, a former Duke University Law student who worked closely with Joan Little on her case. Galloway spent countless hours with Ms. Little and came to know her better than anyone else during the trial. Others who took part in Little's case included Maulana Karenga (Ron Karenga), Ralph Abernathy, who spoke during a protest outside Beaufort County courthouse, Bernice Johnson Reagon, who contributed to funding support for Ms. Little, and Dr. Larry Little, a Black Panther Party leader (Winston-Salem chapter), who stood by Little's side and was vocal in his concerns about the trial and about subjects that weren't well covered during the trial. During the Little trial, other women came forward to testify about Alligood's history of sexual assault in prison, including African American women Ida Mae Roberson and Phyllis Ann Moore. Their testimony encouraged Little's jury to lean toward her defense.  Effects  Her murder trial focused national attention on the issues of a woman's right to defend herself from rape, the validity of capital punishment in North Carolina, racial and sexual inequality in the criminal justice system, and the rights of prisoners in general. It also inspired women's rights movements abroad, including Joan-s√∏strene (The Joan sisters) in Denmark. \\"Free Joan Little,\\" was a form that activist took to be able to raise awareness of her situation and try to get her released. It was said that without the funding and activists' support Joan Little would possibly be serving a death sentence. Jerry Paul, Joan Little's chief attorney was sentenced to fourteen days in jail for choice of words and wants against Judge Hamilton H. Hobgood. The trial became a global known case for many from those who believed her to be guilty and those who did not. for those standing behind her saw a woman that was a victim of racism, sexism, and was vulnerable because she was the only female prisoner at the Beaufort jail during that time. Those who thought of her as being guilty saw her as luring in Alligood into her cell with ideas of sex and killed the jailer to be able to escape the prison. The case was well known during the late 70's, because it had shown signs of what the black movement as well as other movements wanted to stand behind. These organizations came together to support Little because of the connections there were between racism, sexism, rape against women of color, as well as women rights movements. With illustrations of the double binds that African American women have to deal with within the prison industrial complex. Little authored a poem entitled \\"I Am Somebody\\", which was incorporated into a mural in San Diego's Chicano Park by the female muralists of Sacramento's Royal Chicano Air Force. The a cappella musical group Sweet Honey in the Rock included a song titled \\"Joanne Little\\" on their 1976 self-titled album.  Later in life  In 1989, Little was arrested in New York City on charges including driving a stolen car. She telephoned William Kunstler, who had assisted her in the past, for help. As of June 1989 Joan Little was free and had returned to New York. This being the latest arrest found Little was at the age of 34, who was accompanied by a male after being pulled over for driving a car with missing front license plate and the back license plate being stolen as well as other charges with that. She remained the night at the Hudson County jail. Since this last arrest in '89 Joan Little has disappeared from public view. Although she isn't active, her case brought forward sexual abuse towards women in the prison industrial complex. The \\"Free Joan Little\\" organizations had also brought to view the issues of racism, police brutality, as well as the full justice and corrections systems, and how they all interconnect.

This monastic foundation was one of the first houses of contemplative Benedictine nuns in the United States. Mother Benedict and Mother Mary were both nuns of the Benedictine Abbey of Notre Dame de Jouarre in France. Mother Benedict had grown up in Paris and studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Until the monastery of Regina Laudis gained abbatial status, it was a dependent priory of Jouarre Abbey, a 7th-century monastery northeast of Paris, France.

The movie depicts how the nuns were taken in by Bethlehem artist Lauren Ford. \\"Mother ... met with many obstacles, (but) support from the Church came from many, most especially the Papal Nuncio to Paris, the future Pope John XXIII, and Cardinal Montini, who would later become Pope Paul VI,\\" according to the abbey's website. \\"Through a friendship of many years Pope Paul VI offered inspired wisdom and astute practical advice, suggesting from the beginning that if the new monastery was to attract the dedication of American women, they must be encouraged to have a professional basis for their contemplative life.\\" =Later history= Since its foundation as a priory in 1947, the monastery has grown to include some 37 nuns. The Monastery of Regina Laudis became an independent abbey in 1976. On February 10, 1976, Mother Benedict Duss, O.S.B. was elected the first Abbess of the Benedictine Abbey of Regina Laudis and became the first nun in America to receive the abbatial blessing. In the late 1960s the abbey, in conjunction with its Jesuit spiritual adviser, Francis Prokes, formed a number of lay communities. As these communities grew through the 1970s and 1980s, the abbey and Prokes drew the attention of the press for practices and behavior that critics considered manipulative, authoritarian, and \\"cultlike\\". The Abbey was featured on ABC‚Äôs 20/20 and CBS‚Äôs West 57th and was investigated by the Vatican in the early 1990s. As a result of the investigation Prokes was forced to leave the Abbey in 1994 and other restrictions were imposed.

Kuppens is a student and lover of Shakespeare with a Ph.D. in English from Yale University. She has been coordinator of the Monastic Studies and Monastic Internship Programs of the abbey for almost thirty years. She has always insisted that intellectual life be grounded in the practicals of everyday incarnational life. She has been Cellarer of the Abbey, responsible for the maintenance of the Abbey property and buildings since 2001.

It was incorporated in 1998. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 87. History Named for nearby Sweetwater Creek, the town is at the junction of State Highway 30 and State Highway 152. Sweetwater originated around the time of the Cheyenne-Arapaho land opening in 1892. A post office for Sweetwater was established September 27, 1894 (current zip code 73666). By 1910 the community had an estimated population of 50, two general stores, a dry goods‚Äìgrocery store, a cotton gin and fuel company. The residents expected the construction of a railroad through the area, but none was built, and this limited further growth. The town did expand to about 100 people around the time of World War I, based on being an agricultural service center for the surrounding township, and the postmaster estimated 150 in the 1930s. However, the population started a decline even before World War II as improved roads and automobile transportation carried business south to Erick or east to Elk City.

It was founded in 1996 and acts as an umbrella organisation for a number of local groups in Norway. Activity √Ösatrufellesskapet Bifrost is an umbrella organisation for local heathen (Germanic neopagan) groups that perform sacrificial bl√≥ts. The groups are called blotslag, from bl√≥t and lag which means \\"small group\\" or \\"party\\". Individual members are also permitted. As of the autumn of 2016, Bifrost had 368 members and nine registered blotslag. About half of the members were members of a blotslag. The stated goal of the organisation is to carry on old customs and traditions and make them meaningful in contemporary life. The members share a religious practice but may vary in their beliefs. Bifrost's basic doctrines are summarised in a document titled Eden (\\"The Oath\\"); according to the scholars Geir Uldal and Geir Winje, the \\"underlying ontology in this text seems close to what we know today about pre-Christian Norse religion\\". Several prominent members have academic degrees in subjects like history of religion and folklore studies and combine the religious practice with academic studies. The organisation publishes the magazine Bifrost Tidende (\\"The Bifrost Times\\"). It also works actively to ensure that Norse symbols are associated with old customs rather than \\"hateful ideologies\\". Since 2017, Bifrost own the facility Fagerh√∏i i S√∏re Osen, Trysil. The building had previously been a school and a cultural centre. Bifrost use the facility for a few larger events per year, but also rent it out and aim to host concerts, exhibitions and offer courses in arts and handicrafts. The leader of the organisation is called h√∏vding (\\"chieftain\\"). As of 2014, the position was held by Eirik Sverreson Indreg√•rd. The name means \\"The √°s faith fellowship Bifrost\\". Bifrost is the bridge between the world of men and the world of gods in Norse mythology. History Bifrost has its background in the Oslo group Blindern √Ösatrolag (B√ÖL), founded in 1983 and named after the university district Blindern. B√ÖL eventually joined forces with the group Draupnir from V√•ler in Sol√∏r to form an umbrella organisation. Bifrost was officially registered and recognised by the government on 28 February 1996. In 1998, a request for a name change to √Ösatrufellesskapet Bifrost was initially rejected by the Ministry of Justice. This was attributed to a comment from the scholar Gro Steinsland, who said that modern √•satru was \\"a historical falsification\\", and would be detrimental to \\"all serious activities concerning the Viking Age\\". The parliamentary Ombudsman however concluded that this was not a legitimate reason for the government to not accept a religion. An important source of inspiration for Bifrost has been √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ in Iceland. The original subculture that B√ÖL appeared in was however more generally characterised by an interest in paganism and the occult. Because of this, prominent people from the early days of Bifrost had personal connections to movements such as Thelema and LaVeyan Satanism. This heterogeneity resulted in a schism in 1998, when a number of members left and formed Foreningen Forn Sed, which is based on \\"Norwegian folklore\\". These two umbrella organisations have since held the majority of organised heathens in Norway.

It is bounded by the districts of Shirley, Bassett, Highfield and Portswood. The area supports a large variety of wildlife, including one of the largest populations in Britain of the nationally rare great crested newt. The Common is used for a wide variety of community events, Flower Festival, Race for life Cancer Research UK and formerly 'Power in the Park' hosted by Power FM. An area of is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Layout Southampton Common currently includes of woodland, parkland, rough grassland, ponds, wetlands, nature trails, a paddling pool, a children's play area, a model yachting lake, and a fishing lake. The Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre at the southern end has been built on the former site of Southampton Zoo and the comprehensive displays document the natural history of the area; with interactive resources, educational facilities and information about local wildlife and environmental management. To the west, bordering on Hill Lane, is a historic cemetery that also includes many rare flora and fauna. Cemetery Lake is popular for birds. The south east of the Common includes an open air paddling pool that has recently been refurbished and a play area for children. This is located near to a car parking zone and the Cowherds Inn, a local landmark which has a history going back to the 17th century. The road between Southampton and Winchester runs through the common. The section through the common is known as the Avenue. In 1760 it was straightened by the Southampton to Winchester turnpike trust. Since at least 1763 trees have been deliberately planted alongside the road. There are a number of streams on the common that are collectively part of the Rollesbrook system. An artificial connection to Freemantle stream that runs to the ornamental lake has also been created. The mainline of the Rollesbrook system rises slightly to the south of Cutthorn Mound at the northern end of the common. It flows in a general south westerly direction passing under the avenue and being joined by several tributaries before leaving the area via the southern side of the cemetery.  History  Paleolithic artifacts have been found in gravel pits on the common. It has been suggested that the area's status as a common goes back to the town of Hamwic around 500AD. The documented history of Southampton Common can be traced back to a dispute over land rights in the 13th century. The dispute (which also included land beyond the common) was between the Lord of the manor of Shirley one Nicholas de Sirlie and the Burgesses of Southampton. The dispute was resolved on 13 May 1228 by the Borough agreeing to make a small payment to Nicholas de Sirlie and withdrawing any claims over the land that became known as Shirley Common. In return Nicholas de Sirlie renounced any claims over Southampton common and accepted that rights of common would be limited to those living within the borough boundaries. The designation as Common Land allowed all householders with the borough paying watch and ward to use the land for fuel, clay, and taking berries and other wild, natural food. The most important use was for grazing, however, and there was a cowherd who was paid to be responsible for the cattle on the common. As well as looking after the cattle it was the cowherd's job to perform maintenance on the gates fences and banks on the common. For this the cowheard was paid in the 17th century 2d per cow but was required to rent a house on the common for 20 shillings per year. The job of cowheard was often performed by the same family from generation to generation and the office was sometimes held by a woman such as Elizabeth Fawkens who was the widow of the previous cowheard and held the office for five years from 1675. By the mid 16th century the rising population of the Borough resulted in commoners being limited to having no more than two animals on the common. At the same time the first reference to a Brickmaker living and working on the common appear. The area around the original brickmaker's house was worked out by the early 18th century resulting in the house being moved to site near the current wildlife center. This site was worked out by 1814. In 1595 the first attempt to attempt to supply Southampton with water was made by Roger Pedley. This attempt was only partially successful and was disrupted a year later by a Mr Robert Russell digging on the common. The use of the common for grazing declined from the mid 18th century. In 1762 the cowherd's house was rebuilt at the expense of Alderman William Knight who agreed to pay for the building on the condition that the rent (which was then raise to ¬£6 a year) was distributed among the poor of Southampton's parishes. In order to meet this higher rent the cowherd began to sell alcoholic beverages and refreshments. In 1774 the office of cowherd was taken over by a brewer and in 1789 the cowherd's house was leased by town council to a firm of brewers as an inn. The cowherd ceased to be appointed sometime between 1834 and 1836 with the remaining duties falling to the Haywarden until that office also stopped being filled in 1907. The last brickmaking on the common ceased in 1852 although the brick maker had ceased to live on the common after 1814. For a period the town gallows were located on the north of Southampton Common with the last execution taking place there in 1785. =19th century= In 1814 the town clerk managed to get permission to build a house on the common on the site of the former brickmaker's house. This house, known as Hawthorn cottage, was sold in 1851 to and again in 1887 and continued to be occupied until 1942. A racecourse was built in on the common in 1822 but falling attendances, with the various structures on the course having to be sold off in 1848 to meet the costs, it ceased to be used. In 1843 of the common was split off by the Southampton Corporation to be used a cemetery. The power to do this was provided by the Southampton Cemetery Act 1843 which allowed up to to be taken. The Cemetery opened in 1846 and is now known as Southampton Old Cemetery. A further was taken from the common and added to the cemetery in 1863. In 1884 an act of parliament was obtained to transfer another to the cemetery. Southampton Common Cemetery lake The common became a public park in 1844 as the result of the council using the powers of the Marsh Improvement Act of 1844. The racecourse on the common was rebuilt in 1860 and races continued to be held until 1881. In the mid 1860s a cricket pitch was constructed within the racecourse with upgrades taking place in 1874. In the same year the council gave permission for a golf course to be constructed on the common. The first show was held on the common in 1873 in the form of the Royal Counties Agricultural Society show. From then on large shows either from the Royal Counties Agricultural Society or the Bath and West of England Society took place every few years. The first non-reservoir pond on the common appeared sometime between 1800 and 1846 and was just beyond what was then the Cemetery's north east corner. This pond disappeared with the 1884 expansion of the cemetery. Separately, a few years before the expansion, a disused gravel pit had filled with water to the point it became a rough pond. In 1881 it was decided to form this pond into cemetery lake essentially by tidying it up and making more controllable connections to the streams on the common. In 1888 the council decided to construct a second lake known as the ornamental lake in part as a job creation scheme. The lake was constructed in a crescent shape divided into two levels with a dam with a waterfall separating the two. Southampton Common ornamental lake In 1892 a small hospital was built on the common for cholera and smallpox cases. It was soon judged unsuitable and was removed by the end of the year. The council instead purchased City of Adelaide to use as a hospital ship. Waterworks In 1803 the first of a number of reservoirs was constructed by the Southampton Waterworks commissioners. The reservoir was constructed behind the Cowherd's inn. The second reservoir to be built on the common was constructed in 1830 just to the north of the initial reservoir and a third was added in 1831. In 1835 the Southampton Waterworks commissioners decided to build an artesian well on the common. Work started on the well in 1836 but stopped a year later. Work stated again in 1842 but issues with the well producing only small amounts of water and disagreements between conservatives and radicals among the Southampton Waterworks commissioners resulted in work stopping in 1845. Over the following decades occasional further drilling took place on the well with the final work being carried out in 1883 reaching a depth of . In 1850 a further pair of reservoirs was constructed on the northern part of the common this time to hold water taken from the River Itchen at Mansbridge. The power to do this came from Southampton Waterworks Amendment Act 1850. Water stopped being transferred from Mansbridge in 1892 and the reservoirs were converted to covered reservoirs in 1895. Meanwhile, the reservoir behind the Cowherd's inn (the first reservoir constructed on the common) was filled 1871. The second and third reservoirs continued to see some use supplying water for watering the roads. The third reservoir was used for sailing model yachts from 1894 and in 1897 complaints over its condition resulted in the banks being rebuilt in concrete. =20th century= During World War 1, much of the common was taken over by the military. This marked the end of golf being played on the common. A large number of huts were constructed on the common and it was used as a rest camp for troop preparing to leave the country via the Port of Southampton. The common was returned to the council in 1919 and the remaining military buildings were removed over the next two years. In the 1920s football was being widely played on the common with 30 pitches in use. On top of this 5 cricket pitches were constructed between 1926 and 1932. The demand for sporting facilities on the common declined with the opening of Southampton sports centre in 1938. During World War 2 the common was again taken over by the military and again huts were constructed on the common. While it was mostly used as a camp by various allied forces a prisoner of war camp was also set up on the common. The common continued to be used as a transit camp after the war and was returned to the civilian authorities in a rather piecemeal manner with the final part being handed over in August 1950. During this period a number of huts were taken over by squatters. In particular a camp to the north east of the common (officially Camp C18 but it became known as The Squatters's Camp) ended up being run by Southampton housing department. The last of the squatted huts were cleared at the end of January 1953. A further 4 huts (originally part of camp C19) were used by the local education system until being removed in October 1970. Hawthorn cottage which has been empty since 1942 was purchased by the council in 1945. By that point it was in rather a poor state so it was demolished and the area was used as a tree nursery. In 1947 the annual Southampton Horticultural Show and fete began being held on the common. In 1952 it was renamed to the Southampton Show. In 1988 the show transitioned into the Balloon & Flower Festival. Tiger at Southampton Zoo in 1981 In 1961 the Southampton zoo was opened on the common using the site of the former Hawthorn cottage. Poor conditions at the zoo led to protests in the early 80s including a march to Hoglands Park. As a result, the zoo closed in 1985. An application was then made to turn the site into a small theme park based around a big wheel. This was rejected and instead the council used the site to construct Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre. In 1968 the council proposed to construct two new car parks on the common. This proposal was challenged in the high court by the Southampton Commons and Parks Protection Society, The Southampton Civic Trust and The Friends of Old Southampton. The council lost the case and as part of the proceedings it became clear that in general driving motor vehicles on the common was illegal under the 1931 Southampton Corporation Act. Since this banned the various vehicles used to maintain the common as well as those used in setting up fairs Southampton council decided to obtain a new act of parliament; the 1971 Southampton Common Act.The 1971 act was later replaced with the 1983 Hampshire act. In 1984 a second court case took place over the use of the common. This time it was over the question of if the common could be used to host Mission Solent (a subset of Billy Graham‚Äôs Mission England). The act stated that sections of the common could be closed for fairs, shows circuses or other functions of like nature. The court ruled that the religious event was not of like nature and could not be held on the common. Towards the end of 1983 and during the start of 1984 the ornamental lake was comprehensively dredged potentially doing significant damage to the wildlife in and around the lake. A plan to do the same to the boating lake was halted by the intervention of the Nature Conservancy Council. In 1985 silt traps were added to two of the streams flowing into the ornamental lake. Waterworks The exterior of the covered reservoir in 2018 In 1919 two drownings in the third reservoir (now the model yacht lake or boating lake) resulted in works that reduced its depth to four feet. The model yacht lake was supplied with water from and drained into the Rollesbrook stream. Between 1934 and 1937 the second reservoir was converted into a paddling pool with a fountain at the centre. A feeder from the Rollesbrook stream was constructed but the pool was general filled from the town's potable water system. Any overflow from the pool drained into the Rollesbrook stream. Maintenance on the ornamental lake stopped during World War 2 resulting it becoming overgrown. The military occupying the common also blocked much of drainage system. In 1952 the two covered reservoirs were merged into one. In the 1980s the banks of the island on Cemetery Lake were reinforced in response to erosion. =21st century= The Balloon festival ceased to be held after 2005. Common People music festival in 2016 The Common People music festival was first held on the common in 2015 and was then held for a further 3 years. The Alt-J song Bloodflood makes reference to the Common. The Common is a venue for a Parkrun; a weekly 5 km run on a Saturday morning starting from near the Hawthorns Centre.http://www.parkrun.org.uk/southampton/ References Further reading * City of Winchester Society.

It is an extension of Wansung Code (KS C 5601:1987, encoded as EUC-KR) to include all 11172 Hangul syllables present in Johab (KS C 5601:1992 annex 3). This corresponds to the pre-composed syllables available in Unicode 2.0 and later. Wansung Code has the drawback that it only assigns codes for the 2350 precomposed Hangul syllables which have their own KS X 1001 (KS C 5601) codepoints (out of 11172 in total, not counting those using obsolete jamo), and requires others to use eight-byte composition sequences, which are not supported by some partial implementations of the standard. UHC resolves this by assigning single codes for all possible syllables constructed using modern jamo, by making assignments outside of the encoding space used for KS X 1001. The lead byte range is extended to 0x81‚ÄìFE, and the trail byte range is extended to 0x41‚Äì5A, 0x61‚Äì7A and 0x81‚ÄìFE (in EUC-KR, both ranges are 0xA1‚ÄìFE). The codes outside the EUC-KR ranges are used for the additional hangul. Terminology Unified Hangul Code is not registered with IANA as a standard to communicate information over the Internet.

Microsoft assigns Windows-949 the label \\"ks_c_5601-1987\\", which properly applies to KS X 1001 itself (KS C 5601 being the original name of KS X 1001). The WHATWG treat the label \\"ks_c_5601-1987\\" interchangeably with \\"EUC-KR\\" with the intent of being \\"compatible with deployed content\\". The Unicode Consortium's \\"OBSOLETE/EASTASIA\\" collection of withdrawn mappings included mappings for Unified Hangul Code as \\"KSC5601.TXT\\", with the automatically derived mappings for 7-bit KS X 1001 being included as \\"KSX1001.TXT\\".

It incorporated story threads from previous Marvel Comics supernatural series, primarily The Tomb of Dracula (April 1972 ‚Äì Aug. 1979) where the three protagonists had first appeared. The series' initial creative team was writer D. G. Chichester, penciller Ron Garney and inker Tom Palmer, reprising his role from The Tomb of Dracula. After 11 issues, Steven Grant took over scripting, with Frank Lovece wrapping up the fates of some of the 1970s series' characters in the last three issues.

In the final arc (#16‚Äì18, Feb.-April 1994), King's house, including Borderline's office, is destroyed by a HYDRA Dreadnought stealing Drake's anti-occult nanotech gun, the Exorcist. Strange reveals that the Montesi Formula, which had eradicated and prevented further vampires, was weakening. In response, he explains, he had gathered the three most experienced vampire-hunters so they could learn to function as a team before Dracula, the Lord of Vampires, returned. Since all three were traumatized by their early vampiric battles, Strange held off informing them of vampires' possible return until necessary. In a final battle, Varnae, a previous Lord of Vampires who had already returned, takes psychic control of King and directs him to kill his comrades. King stakes himself instead. Drake attempts to sacrifice his own life to kill Varnae, engineering an Exorcist-powered explosion. Blade, in self-defense, has already staked Taj Nital, his old comrade from The Tomb of Dracula (who had been turned vampiric between the two series). Blade survives and attends his teammates' funeral but encounters King again in the subsequent series Blade. There he learns King's plunge into a metal pole (rather than silver or wood) had fortuitously not killed him and that he had escaped the explosion. King also informs Blade that Drake was left scarred and crippled in both body and mind. In other media A revised version of the Nightstalkers was depicted in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity starring Wesley Snipes as Blade, Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler and Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King. In the film, Blade was not a Nightstalker himself but allied with them, albeit reluctantly, as they were younger and, in his eyes, less experienced. In contrast to the more mature and reserved Hannibal King depicted in the comics, Reynolds' revision of the character was in keeping with his history of humorous, extroverted characters.

The post office was established May 5, 1879. It was named for David C. Burney, father of Benjamin Crooks Burney, who had been Governor of the Chickasaw Nation from 1878 through 1880. Burneyville is located on State Highway 96 and reaches south to the north bank of the Red River. The Census Bureau defined the Burneyville census-designated place in 2015; as of 2018 the estimated population was 627, with 489 housing units. History Burneyville and Love County were named for prominent Chickasaw people who settled in the area in the early 1840s as part of the Federal removal of the tribe from northern Mississippi to Indian Territory.Ladner, Laquitta. Love County Heritage Commission: History of Love County, Vol. I, (Dallas, TX: NationalShareGraphics, Inc., 1983). David C. Burney and his wife, Lucy James Burney, were Chickasaw who relocated to what was then Pickens County, Indian Territory, from northern Mississippi and established a farm on the site of the future town.Meserve, John Bartlett. \\"Governor Benjamin Franklin Overton and Governor Benjamin Crooks Burney.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 16, No. 2, June 1938. http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles The √©migr√©s traveled to Indian Territory by steamboat up the Red River. They paused at Shreveport, Louisiana, on January 15, 1844, for the birth of a son. The family named him for the boat's captain, Benjamin Crooks. Though the parents did not live to see it happen, both that son, Benjamin Crooks Burney, and a future son-in-law, Benjamin F. Overton, would be elected governors of the Chickasaw Nation in the late 1870s and early 1880s. The mother, Lucy, died in 1845, and the father, David, died shortly after the Civil War. Prior to his death, the Chickasaw Nation honored David C. Burney in the naming of a girls' school. The Burney Academy opened in 1859. A post office was located there from July 3, 1860, to June 22, 1866, although it was probably not in continuous operation because of the Civil War. The site of the academy was southeast of Lebanon in what is now Marshall County. Burney was honored posthumously when the Burneyville post office opened on the site of the family farm on May 5, 1879.Shirk, George H. Oklahoma Place Names, 2nd Edition (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965). . The post office is the oldest in Love County that is still in use. The first postmaster was James C. Nall. The location of the town of Burneyville has never changed. It is situated west-southwest of Marietta, the county seat. It is approximately north of the Red River. Walnut Creek Bayou passes to the north. The Burney Ferry, south of the Burney farm, was the main business and travel route before the Santa Fe Railroad completed its north‚Äìsouth link between Indian Territory and Texas in 1887. With the merger of Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory at statehood in 1907, the county of Love was carved from part of the former Pickens County. The county was named for Overton Love, an esteemed judge of the Chickasaw Nation court who had arrived in Indian Territory in 1843, one year prior to the Burney family. For many years, Burneyville proper has consisted only of the post office, a Baptist church, two cemeteries, and 12 houses. But in its heyday through the first half of the 20th century, the townsite included a hotel, grocery, general merchandise store, blacksmith, druggist, and two doctors.

Beginning in furniture design, Simons launched his own menswear label in 1995. He was creative director at Jil Sander (2005-2012), Christian Dior (2012-2015) and Calvin Klein (2016-2018).Stephen Garner, MR Magazine RAF SIMONS OFFICIALLY STARTS AT CALVIN KLEIN AS CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER August 2, 2016 As of 1 April 2020, he is the co-creative director of Prada, in partnership with Miuccia Prada.Vanessa Friedman (February 23, 2020), Raf Simons Becomes Co-Creative Director at Prada New York Times.Luisa Zargani and Miles Socha (February 23, 2020), Prada Taps Raf Simons as Co-Creative Director Women's Wear Daily. Early life and education Raf Simons was born on 12 January 1968 in Neerpelt, Belgium, to Jacques Simons, an army night watchman, and Alda Beckers, a house cleaner. Simons graduated in Industrial Design and Furniture Design from LUCA School of Arts in Genk in 1991. During this time, Simons congregated at Antwerp cafe Witzli-Poetzli with the likes of Olivier Rizzo, Willy Vanderperre, David Vandewal and then-girlfriend Veronique Branquinho to discuss fashion, namely Helmut Lang and Martin Margiela. He began working as a furniture designer for various galleries, having previously interned at the design studio of Walter Van Beirendonck between 1991-1993. Van Beirendonck took him to Paris Fashion Week and that was when Simons first saw a fashion show ‚Äî Martin Margiela‚Äôs all-white show in 1991 ‚Äî which inspired Simons to turn to fashion design. Career =Raf Simons label= Encouraged by Linda Loppa, head of the fashion department at the Antwerp Royal Academy at the time and now director of the prestigious italian fashion school Polimoda , Simons became a self-trained menswear designer and launched his Raf Simons label in 1995. His first collection was in Fall-Winter 1995, and featured two street models in a video presentation. From Fall-Winter 1995 to Spring-Summer 1997, Simons' collections were shown either in presentations or videos. Fall-Winter 1997 saw his first runway show in Paris, France with a look of 'American college students and English schoolboys with a background of New Wave and Punk'. Simons' early aesthetic incorporated youth culture from divergent sources, such as the Spring-Summer 2000 collection taking inspiration from both MENSA students and the Gabba youth subculture (a predominantly Dutch and Belgian movement associated with hardcore techno music). Music has formed an integral part of Simons‚Äô work, with references to musical figures such as the Manic Street Preachers's Richey Edwards and Joy Division‚Äôs Ian Curtis and his Fall-Winter 1998 collection (Radioactivity) featuring looks modelled after members of German electro band Kraftwerk. In March 2000, Simons shut down his company to take a sabbatical after his Fall-Winter 2000 collection (Confusion). Following a new deal with Belgian manufacturer, Gysemans Clothing Industry, the company was started back up again for Fall-Winter 2001. During this time, Simons' international prominence grew with the collection for Spring-Summer 2002 (Woe Onto Those Who Spit On The Fear Generation...The Wind Will Blow It Back) becoming one of his most influential due to its 'layered, hooded, sinister image of the urban guerrilla'. The company was restructured in October 2004 with a distribution deal with Futurenet (Europe and USA) and Mitsui & Co. (Asia), followed by a license agreement with Futurepresent (joint-venture of Futurenet and Mitsui Italia). This deal came to an end with the Spring-Summer 2011 collection. The aesthetic of the Raf Simons brand has changed since 2005, as former Arena Homme Plus editor Jo-Ann Furniss asserts: \\"The key turning point was A/W 04-05 (Waves), when the obsessive youth culture codes of his past were turned into clothes that were purely about shape and form.\\" In June 2005, Raf by Raf Simons was launched, which was sold at a lower price point. Simons also released the book Raf Simons: Redux about the first 10 years of his career. Alongside the publication, there was also an exhibition of Simons' work and an outdoor fashion show at the Pitti Immagine Uomo tradeshow in Florence, Italy for a retrospective of the designer's career at the age of 38. In 2008, two flagship Raf Simons stand-alone stores opened in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, in collaboration with the artists Sterling Ruby and Roger Hiorns. The Autumn-Winter 2009 collection saw the first Raf Simons advertising campaign, photographed by Willy Vanderperre. In 2011, Raf by Raf Simons was replaced by Raf Simons 1995, a diffusion line incorporating elements from Simons' early collections. Raf Simons 1995 also includes homeware, namely blankets and cushions. Collaborations Since 2008, Simons has created collections in collaboration with British brand Fred Perry. From Spring-Summer 2008 onwards, Simons has collaborated with Linda Farrow on a collection of sunglasses for the brand. Since Fall-Winter 2009, Simons has also collaborated with running shoe manufacturer Asics. For the Fall-Winter 2013 show, a new limited-edition footwear collaboration with Adidas was announced featuring five different designs. Simons has designed three collaborations with American bag manufacture Eastpak: Spring-Summer 2008, Fall-Winter 2008 and Spring-Summer 2009. The collaboration has continued for the Fall-Winter 2013 season. In 2009, Simons used denim bleached by artist Sterling Ruby to create a capsule collection of denim wear jeans and jackets.Sterling Ruby#Collaborations with Raf Simons In 2014, Simons once again collaborated with Ruby, jointly designing a Fall-Winter 2014 collection, which was presented in place of Simon's eponymous line and carried the label 'Raf Simons/Sterling Ruby'. In 2014 Raf Simons began a collaboration with the Danish design and textile company Kvadrat that would translate into a collection of textiles and accessories. The Kvadrat/Raf Simons collection received great recognition in the media and is distinguished by the blending of colour and materials for which the designer is known in the fashion world. Raf Simons would later come to include the Kvadrat/Raf Simons textiles in his A/W 15 menswear collection. In 2016, Raf Simons collaborated with the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation for his Spring-Summer 2017 collection. The collection debuted at Pitti Uomo in Florence, Italy. =Jil Sander= In June 2005, Simons was appointed as Creative Director for the Jil Sander label, by its owner the Prada Group (which was later acquired by Change Capital Partners and then GIBO Co. SpA, the Italian subsidiary of Japanese firm Onward Holdings Co. Ltd). This marked the first occasion when the designer had created women's clothing and accessories, whilst also designing the brand's male collections. During his tenure at Jil Sander, Simons moved the brand's aesthetic from an austere minimalism and expanded its commercial appeal with the creation of a womenswear diffusion line, Jil Sander Navy. In 2010, Simons‚Äôs work was seen to take a more fanciful turn when he presented the first of three couture- inspired collections, all of which played with the shapes, colors, and proportions associated with haute couture, and were his most feminine to date. Rumors that Simons was a serious candidate to replace Yves Saint Laurent designer Stefano Pilati surfaced in the press several times‚Äîmost recently in September 2011.Dana Thomas (November 29, 2012), The Queen of Clean Wall Street Journal. Later, the press reported that Simons was interviewing for the creative director slot at Christian Dior, which had remained vacant since John Galliano was fired in March 2011. Simons' last collection for Jil Sander was Fall-Winter 2012, following his dismissal by Onward Holdings in favour of Jil Sander's return. The collection was well received. =Christian Dior= In April 2012, it was announced that Simons would replace John Galliano as creative director at the helm of Dior, ending a period of transition after Galliano's dismissal from the role. However, he did not design the menswear collections, as fellow Belgian designer Kris van Assche remained as Dior Homme creative director. Simons' first collection for Haute Couture Fall-Winter 2012 was well-received as the designer focused on the 1950s by playing with some of Christian Dior‚Äôs famous silhouettes: the A line and the H line, and the Bar jacket. Simons said he aims ‚Äúto bring some emotion back, to what I felt in the nineties, because I see a lot of amazing clothes, but I don‚Äôt see a lot of emotion now.‚Äù In 2014, Fr√©d√©ric Tcheng wrote and directed a documentary, called Dior and I, or Dior et moi in French, about Raf Simons \\"as he created his first couture collection for Dior\\". The documentary's world premiere was at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Like many alcohols, it is a water-soluble, colourless liquid. It is more toxic than typical small alcohols. Allyl alcohol is used as a raw material for the production of glycerol, but is also used as a precursor to many specialized compounds such as flame-resistant materials, drying oils, and plasticizers. Allyl alcohol is the smallest representative of the allylic alcohols. Production Allyl alcohol can be obtained by many methods. It was first prepared in 1856 by Auguste Cahours and August Hofmann by hydrolysis of allyl iodide. Today allyl alcohol is produced commercially by the Olin and Shell corporations through the hydrolysis of allyl chloride: :CH2=CHCH2Cl + NaOH ‚Üí CH2=CHCH2OH + NaCl Allyl alcohol can also be made by the rearrangement of propylene oxide, a reaction that is catalyzed by potassium alum at high temperature. The advantage of this method relative to the allyl chloride route is that it does not generate salt. Also avoiding chloride- containing intermediates is the \\"acetoxylation\\" of propylene to allyl acetate: :CH2=CHCH3 \\\\+ 1/2 O2 \\\\+ CH3COOH ‚Üí CH2=CHCH2OCOCH3 \\\\+ H2O Hydrolysis of this acetate gives allyl alcohol. In alternative fashion, propylene can be oxidized to acrolein, which upon hydrogenation gives the alcohol. =Other methods= In principle, allyl alcohol can be obtained by dehydrogenation of propanol. In the laboratory, it has been prepared by the reaction of glycerol with oxalic or formic acids. Allyl alcohols in general can be prepared by allylic oxidation of allyl compounds by selenium dioxide. Applications Allyl alcohol is converted mainly to glycidol, which is a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of glycerol, glycidyl ethers, esters, and amines. Also, a variety of polymerizable esters are prepared from allyl alcohol, e.g. diallyl phthalate. Safety Allyl alcohol is more toxic than related alcohols. Its threshold limit value (TLV) is 2 ppm. It is a lachrymator. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

Population: 53,000 (1972). History The stanitsa of Labinskaya was founded in autumn of 1841. It was named after the Bolshaya Laba River on which it stands. Its history is closely connected with the history of the Caucasian War and establishment of a special strategic defense line on the Bolshaya Laba River. The stanitsa was originally one of the fortresses that were founded along the southern border of the Russian Empire neighboring the Caucasus mountains and were protected by the Don Cossacks who eventually became the first settlers of Labinskaya. Later, many peasants belonging to the Cossack social class, both Russians and Ukrainians, moved to Labinskaya from the inner territories of Russia. With a population over 30,000 people, Labinskaya soon became a big trade center among the neighboring stanitsas owing to its favorable location in the river valley. In 1913, a railway station was built in Labinskaya that integrated it in the railway system of the Russian Empire. From August 1942 to January 1943, Labinskaya was occupied by the Germans. The residents were resisting the enemy‚ÄîLabinsk Fighter Squadron was established in the stanitsa with Ivan Konstantinov appointed as the Commander-in-Chief. After the war, one of the central streets was named after him. On January 25, 1943, Labinskaya was liberated from the Nazi occupation. In the post-war years, Labinskaya was quickly rebuilt and renovated. In 1947, the stanitsa was granted town status and renamed Labinsk. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Labinsk serves as the administrative center of Labinsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Reference Information #34.01-707/13-03 As an administrative division, together with two rural localities, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Labinsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.

History Turpin was named for Carl Julian Turpin, a son of Thomas James Turpin and Elmanda (Kennerly) Turpin. Carl was born on 10 Aug 1871 in Quantico, Wicomico County, Maryland. He died 20 Nov 1942 in Oklahoma City.\\"Carl J. Turpin, Savings and Loan Official Here, Is Dead,\\" The Daily Oklahoman, November 20, 1942 Carl J.

In 1918, two farmers from Hardtner, Kansas, Jacob Achenbach and Ira B. Blackstock, requested his assistance. Messrs. Achenbach and Blackstock had been asked by farmers in Beaver County and the surrounding areas to build a railroad through the Panhandle so that their wheat crops could be shipped to outlying markets. Achenbach and Blackstock knew how to build the railroad, but they needed someone to manage it. That is where Carl Julian Turpin came in.\\"Panhandlers\\", Time magazine, July 13, 1931 Mr. Turpin had ample experience as a railroad man, his career beginning in 1888. Described as a \\"by the book\\" type of general manager, Turpin was a stern, well-groomed man.Hofsommer, Donovan L., Katy Northwest: The Story of a Branch Line Railroad, page 190, (Pruett Publishing Company, Boulder, Colorado, 1975; reprinted by Indiana University Press, 1999.) He worked without salary, but did receive stock in the line, from 1918 until 1926. At its height, the Beaver, Mead and Englewood Railroad ran from Beaver, to Eva, Oklahoma, with an extension and connection to the Santa Fe Railroad in Keyes. The line connected with the Katy at Forgan and the Rock Island at Hooker. The BM&E; was eventually sold to M-K-T (Katy) Railroad Company in 1931.\\"Faith in Oklahoma Reaps Rich Rewards\\", The Daily Oklahoman, March 7, 1931 \\"When I was a kid 20 years old, but married, I used to want to work for a railroad which paid $50 a month and furnished its agents a two- story house on the line, rent, brooms, and matches free. Maybe I still could find something like that,\\" Turpin said, after the sale of the Beaver, Mead and Englewood Railroad. General Turpin centers around its independent school district. It consists of a multi-building K-12 facility that draws its student body from surrounding farms and the housing communities of Ponderosa and Pheasant Run. This in turn means that, while Turpin is smaller than the surrounding communities of Beaver, Forgan, Hooker, and Tyrone, it has a comparatively large student body. The school is the largest employer in the community, and the hub for community activities. Turpin comes to life between summers, beginning with football and basketball in the fall and ending with track, softball, and baseball in the spring.

It is majority owned by the American company Molson Coors. History The Apatin Brewery building. It was founded in 1756 as Imperial Brewery owned by the Imperial Chamber. It is one of the oldest breweries in Serbia. The production of 12,000 hectoliters of beer was recorded in the 18th century. The brewery was transferred to private ownership for the first time at the end of the 19th century. Major investments were characteristic of that phase, with a primary goal of modernizing the brewing process and enlarging production capacities. In the period prior to World War I, the yearly production of beer was 16,000 hectoliters. The brewery went through hard times in 1930s, which ultimately led to the disruption of production in 1935. Nine years later, after the liberation of Belgrade in World War II and reparation of the old equipment, a new phase of the company began. By 1950, more than 40,000 hectoliters of beer were produced. Continuous investments resulted in the reconstruction and modernization of the production facilities and the application of new technologies in the production process and the increase in the beer production capacities. All this was conducted in the period 1958‚Äì1966 and it represented a basis for further development of the brewery and transformation into large company. In the 1970s, the process of automated production lines was introduced, the result of which was production over 630,000 hectoliters of beer in 1977, as well as the introduction of new non- alcoholic beverages tasting of orange, lemon, blueberry and Alpine herbs. The result of the economic sanctions in the 1990s was a brief period of decrease in the brewery production, so that 475,000 hectoliters of beer was produced yearly. The company began transferring into the private ownership in 1991, and in 2003 it became a part of the international InterBrew network which merged in 2005 in InBev corporation. Over three years, InBew invested around 100 million euros in technology of the company. In 2008, the company became a part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. In December 2009, Apatin Brewery became a part of the StarBev regional brewery group based in Prague, founded by a leading investment company CVC Capital Partners. Except Serbia, the group operated on the markets of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, Romania and Slovakia. On 3 April 2012, Molson Coors brewing company has completed its previously announced acquisition of StarBev for approximately ‚Ç¨2.65 billion. This way, Molson Coors took over the regional brewing group Starbev, as part of which Apatin Brewery in Serbia has been operating. Today, it is the leading brewery on the Serbian market. Brands Brands produced in Apatin Brewery are: Jelen, Apatinsko, Jelen Cool, Jelen Fresh, Staropramen, Beck's, Stella Artois, Nik≈°iƒáko pivo and Nik≈°iƒáko tamno.

She fought the French at the Battle of Ushant (1778) and the Dutch at the Battle of Dogger Bank (1781). The French captured her in the Action of 8 March 1795 during the French Revolutionary Wars and she served with them with some success then and at the start of the Napoleonic Wars until the British recaptured her at the Battle of Trafalgar. Berwick sank shortly thereafter in a storm. Royal Navy service Representation of the Distressed Situation of His Majesty's Ships Ruby, Hector, Berwick and Bristol when Dismasted in the Great Hurricane, 6 October 1780 As one of the newest ships of the line, she was commissioned in December 1777. On the entry of France into the American War of Independence in 1778 Berwick joined the Channel Fleet. In July, she took part in the Battle of Ushant under the command of Captain the Hon. Keith Stewart. She served with the Channel Fleet throughout 1779. In 1780 she was sent out to the West Indies as part of a squadron under Commodore Walshingham that was sent out to reinforce the fleet under Sir George Rodney. But Walshingham's ships arrived too late for the battles of that year and she was then sent to Jamaica. The lieutenant on this trip was John Hunter, who later became an admiral and the second Governor of New South Wales. While Berwick was on the Jamaica station, she received serious damage from the October 1780 West Indies hurricane, which completely dismasted her and drove her out to sea. The damage forced her to return across the Atlantic to England for repairs. After repairs, Berwick sailed to the North Sea where Captain Stewart became commander in chief of the station. The North Sea was becoming an increasingly important convoy route because French and Spanish squadrons cruising in the Western Approaches to the Channel had made that route unsafe for British convoys. In 1781 Berwick was under the command of Captain John Ferguson. On 17 April she, with Belle Poule, captured the privateer Callonne, under the command of Luke Ryan. Calonne was only two years old, a fast sailer, and well equipped for a voyage of three months. She had a crew of 200 men and was armed with twenty-two 9-pounder guns, six 4-pounder guns, and six 12-pounder carronades. When the British Admiralty received news that the Dutch, who had joined the war at the beginning of 1781, were fitting out a squadron for service in the North Sea, it reinforced Berwick with a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, who had hoisted his flag in . Berwick also received two 68-pounder carronades for her poop deck. On 15 August, while escorting a convoy of 700 merchantmen from Leith to the Baltic, Parker's squadron of seven ships of the line met a Dutch squadron under Rear-Admiral Johan Zoutman, also consisting of seven ships of the line, but also encumbered with a convoy. In the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank, Berwick suffered a total of 16 killed and 58 wounded.Ships of the Old Navy, Berwick. After the war, Berwick was paid off in 1783 and laid up in ordinary. She was commissioned again on 1 January 1793 under Captain Sir John Collins. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars he sailed her out for the Mediterranean on 22 May to join the fleet under Admiral Lord Hood. Under Hood, Berwick participated in Toulon operations late in the year. Collins died in March 1794. His successors were, in short order, Captains William Shield, George Campbell, George Henry Towry, and lastly, William Smith. =Capture= In early 1795 Berwick had been refitting in San Fiorenzo Bay, Corsica, when her lower masts, stripped of rigging, rolled over the side and were lost. A hasty court martial dismissed Smith, the First Lieutenant, and the Master from the ship. After fitting a jury rig, Berwick, under Captain Adam Littlejohn, sailed to join the British fleet at Leghorn, but ran into the French fleet. Troude, p.426 In the ensuing action the French captured Berwick. At 11 am, close off Cap Corse, the French frigate Alceste passed to leeward and opened fire within musket-shot on Berwicks lee bow. Minerve and Vestale soon took their stations on Berwick's quarter. By noon, her rigging was cut to pieces and every sail was in ribbons. During the battle four sailors were wounded and a bar-shot decapitated Littlejohn; he was the only man killed. Command then devolved upon Lieutenant Nesbit Palmer, who consulted with the other officers. Palmer decided that Berwick was unable to escape in her disabled state and that all further resistance was useless; he then ordered that Berwick strike her colours.James (1837), p.254-5. The French towed her back to Toulon and subsequently commissioned her into the French Navy as Berwick, under Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille. French Navy service In September 1795, she sailed from Toulon for Newfoundland as part of a squadron of six ships of the line under Rear- Admiral de Richery. In October, Richery's squadron fell in with the British Smyrna convoy, taking 30 out of 31 ships, and retaking the 74-gun Censeur. The squadron then put into C√°diz, where it remained refitting for the remainder of the year. On 4 August 1796, Richery finally set sail from C√°diz for North America with his seven ships of the line. His squadron was escorted out into the Atlantic by the Spanish Admiral Don Juan de L√°ngara, with 20 ships of the line. In September, Richery destroyed the British Newfoundland fishing fleet. In November, Berwick returned to Rochefort with four of the other ships from Richery's squadron, before sailing on to Brest. By 1803, Berwick was back in the Mediterranean at Toulon. Napoleonic Wars In March 1805, Berwick sailed for the West Indies as part of a fleet of 11 French ships of the line under Vice-Admiral Villeneuve. Off C√°diz, the fleet was joined by the 74-gun ship Aigle, and six Spanish ships of the line under Vice-Admiral Gravina. When the fleet reached the West Indies, Villeneuve sent Commodore Cosmao-Kerjulien with the Pluton and the Berwick to attack the British position on Diamond Rock, which surrendered on 2 June. When Villeneuve heard that Nelson had followed him to the West Indies, he sailed for Europe. Sir Robert Calder, with 15 ships of the line, intercepted the French off Cape Finisterre. After a violent artillery exchange, the fleets separated in the fog. Exhausted after six months at sea, the French anchored in Ferrol before sailing to C√°diz to rest and refit. With his command under question and wanting to meet the British fleet to gain a decisive victory, Villeneuve left C√°diz to meet the British fleet near Cape Trafalgar. Fate On 21 October 1805, Berwick fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, where re-captured her. Berwick sank near Sanl√∫car in the tempest the following day after her French prisoners cut her cables.Gossett (1986), p. 51. Although was nearby and quickly sent boats, many of the c.200 persons aboard Berwick lost their lives.

He was brought to Monclova, and later to Mexico City, by Alonso de Le√≥n, the Spanish governor of Coahuila. Gery was interrogated by Spanish officials, and could not tell a coherent tale, though he consistently claimed to have originally come from a French fort to the east.

He was an outcast of high society, and was disinherited by his parents when he became a newspaper publisher. He desired to live a \\"normal\\" life but was burdened by large debt and could not maintain the lifestyle associated with his family's social position to which he had become accustomed. Early life Cornelius Vanderbilt IV was born on April 30, 1898, in Staten Island to Cornelius \\"Neily\\" Vanderbilt III (1873‚Äì1942) and Grace Graham Wilson (1870‚Äì1953). Throughout his life, the younger Vanderbilt was known as \\"Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr.\\" whereas his father, after 1918, was commonly referred to as \\"General Vanderbilt\\", as he had served as a brigadier general in the First World War. The younger Vanderbilt was commonly called \\"Neil\\" by his family and friends. Vanderbilt attended Harstrom's Tutoring School and St. Paul's School as a young man. He was preparing to enter Yale University when his studies were interrupted by the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917 ‚Äì shortly before his 19th birthday. Career =World War I service= Shortly after the United States declared war on Germany, much to the chagrin of his mother, Vanderbilt enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1917, at the age of 19. He was originally assigned to the headquarters of the ammunition train of the 27th Division of the New York National Guard, commanded by Major General John F. O'Ryan.New York Times. July 19, 1917. His first posting was in Spartanburg, South Carolina where he was a wagoner driving mules.Farewell to Fifth Avenue. pg. 32-33. As this assignment was not to his liking, Vanderbilt made a deal with General O'Ryan's orderly into changing his orders to go with the division overseas. In exchange, Vanderbilt became the orderly's assistant and helped with various chores.Farewell to Fifth Avenue. pg. 36-38. He went overseas with the division in May 1918 aboard the transport Great Northern. Upon arriving in Brest, France, he was assigned as an orderly to the commander of the U.S. Army stockade there. Vanderbilt disliked his commander, whom he referred to as \\"my torturer\\". By chance, he was able to get a temporary assignment as driver to General Douglas Haig, the commander of the British forces in France. He got the posting when he was in a group of soldiers who asked if anyone knew how to drive a Rolls Royce. Vanderbilt raised his hand since his family only used Rolls-Royces and he was familiar with the peculiarities of their operation.Farewell to Fifth Avenue. pg. 38-40. After his posting with General Haig, Vanderbilt was reassigned to the 27th Division's headquarters where he served as a driver delivering dispatches. While driving on one mission, Vanderbilt had a near fatal accident. Vanderbilt's father was promoted to brigadier general in July 1918. Both Vanderbilts returned to the United States in August 1918 after three months of service in France. His father was reassigned as a brigade commander at Camp Lewis in Washington state. The younger Vanderbilt was promoted to the rank of wagoner (equivalent to a corporal) on August 24 and served as a transportation instructor at American Lake, adjacent to Camp Lewis for the remainder of his military service. Vanderbilt was honorably discharged from the Army on January 25, 1919.Farewell to Fifth Avenue. Cornelius Vanderbilt. Simon and Schuster. 1935. pp. 32-46.New York Times. January 12, 1919.New York Times. January 20, 1919. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to 2nd lieutenant of the Infantry branch in the Officers Reserve Corps.Official List of Officers of the Officers Reserve Corps. August 31, 1919. The Adjutant General's Office. Washington, D.C. 1920. pg. 242. =Post war life= To his parents' dismay, he decided to become a newspaperman. His parents detested the press, seen by them as an invasion of privacy. He worked as a staff member of the New York Herald and later The New York Times in which he had several articles published. Considered a bohemian by his parents, he was frequently at odds with them. In the early 1920s, Vanderbilt launched several newspapers and tabloids‚Äîthe Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News, the San Francisco Illustrated Daily Herald and the Miami Tab among them. Despite claiming to uphold the highest standards of journalistic excellence, the publishings lasted only two and a half years, largely due to predatory competition by newspapers owned by William Randolf Hearst. Vanderbilt Inc. ceased operations with losses amounting to nearly $6 million. Vanderbilt subsequently went to work as an assistant managing editor of the New York Daily Mirror. In 1922, he joined the newly organized New York Civitan Club, an organization whose purpose is \\"to build good citizenship by providing a volunteer organization of clubs dedicated to serving individual and community needs with an emphasis on helping people with developmental disabilities.\\"\\"Vanderbilt\\", TIME, Monday, May 10, 1926. In 1929, he released Reno, a novel about divorce set in Reno, Nevada, where he had been living since his first divorce in 1927. The book was adapted into the similarly titled 1930 film Reno, starring Ruth Roland in her sound film debut. Then, in 1931, he was engaged by Columbia Pictures to make a comedy about the city, in association with John P. Medbury, a humorist =Hitler's Reign of Terror= In 1934 Vanderbilt made the anti-Nazi documentary, Hitler's Reign of Terror.THE FIRST AMERICAN ANTI-NAZI FILM, REDISCOVERED This film was made covertly by Vanderbilt while visiting Nazi Germany shortly after Hitler's rise to power. As its name implies it is an expos√© of the Nazi regime and is regarded as the first anti-Nazi film produced. It particularly highlights the Nazis' oppression of Jews. In the film, Vanderbilt describes Hitler as a combination of politician Huey Long, preacher Billy Sunday and gangster Al Capone. It featured several re-enacted scenes including a brief meeting with Hitler and an interview with former German emperor Kaiser Wilhelm, which was necessary as the original encounters were not filmed. In his autobiographical Farewell to Fifth Avenue, Vanderbilt recounts attempting to interview Hitler a second time but balking at a Nazi demand that he pay $5,000 - ostensibly to benefit the families of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch.Farewell to Fifth Avenue. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. Simon and Schuster. 1935. pp. 193-194. Hitler's Reign of Terror was released on April 30, 1934; a diplomatic protest was made against it by the German embassy. It was banned in New York state, and Illinois would not allow its showing until the title was changed to Hitler Reigns. It received poor reviews and one reviewer scoffed at its prediction that Germany under Hitler would eventually pose a threat to world peace. The film was believed lost for many years until a single surviving copy was found in Belgium. The film was screened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2013. =Farewell to Fifth Avenue= In 1935 Vanderbilt published his autobiography named Farewell to Fifth Avenue. The book provides significant insight to life of those in high society in the early 20th century. In the book Vanderbilt recounts vacationing in Europe on his father's yacht North Star, his military experience in the First World War and his experiences as a newspaper publisher. As the book's title implies, it was also Vanderbilt's point of no return in his rejection of the artifice of high society. Vanderbilt examines the artificial distinctions by which one is considered worthy to be a member of \\"society\\". He comments, \\"all of them building high fences and beating their heads against a stone wall, hating each other and boiling in their own juices and ... playing, for all it's worth, the game called Society.\\"Farewell to Fifth Avenue, p. 92. The book also recounts Vanderbilt acquaintance with a number of high-profile personages, some of whom he was able to interview during his trip to Europe in 1933, while gathering material for his film Hitler's Reign of Terror. These include President Franklin Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm, Benito Mussolini, Pope Pius XI, Joseph Stalin, and Al Capone. In addition to Farewell to Fifth Avenue, Vanderbilt authored other books, including a biography of his mother titled Queen of the Golden Age and Personal Experiences of a Cub Reporter. =World War II service= In 1938, Vanderbilt was commissioned in the United States Army Reserve. As of 1941 he was on active duty with the rank of major in the Intelligence Corps.Roster of the Society of the Cincinnati, 1974. p. 22. He was presented with a commendation by the FBI, probably for counterintelligence work, in 1942. As of December 1942 he was hospitalized at Walter Reed Hospital and was discharged from the Army in 1943 due to poor health.New York Times. December 10, 1942. =Later life= In 1945, Vanderbilt became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati in Rhode Island by right of his descent from his granduncle, Major Ebenezer Flagg of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, who was killed in battle in 1781. In 1953, Vanderbilt obtained a divorce in Nevada from his fifth wife, Patricia Murphy Vanderbilt. Patricia appealed the divorce on the grounds that Cornelius did not have permanent residence in Nevada and the Nevada divorce did not overrule the terms of a separation decree she had earlier obtained in New York. The appeals went all the way to the United States Supreme Court which ruled in Patricia's favor in 1957.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/354/416 Vanderbilt made his home in Reno, Nevada and continued to write and lecture on world affairs. In 1948 he was a strong supporter of the newly created state of Israel. In 1960, he joined Airtronics International Corporation of Fort Lauderdale, Florida as a vice president and director. In that role, he acted as a liaison executive between Airtronics and its civilian customers. Personal life Vanderbilt was married seven times throughout his lifetime, but had no children. His first wedding, an elaborate affair for over 3,000 people, took place on April 29, 1920, where Vanderbilt married New York socialite Rachel Littleton (1901‚Äì1988), the sister of prominent lawyer and politician Martin W. Littleton. The marriage ended in divorce in 1927, after Vanderbilt lost more than $2,000,000 in tabloid newspaper ventures. She later married Jasper Morgan (1900‚Äì1964), a nephew of J.P. Morgan. In July 1928, he married Mrs. Mary Weir Logan (1905‚Äì1984), who obtained a divorce from her former husband, Waldo Hancock Logan, a half hour before the ceremony. Logan, after a subsequent marriage and divorce to actress Ruthelma Stevens, later committed suicide in Miami after ending up penniless. Mary and Cornelius divorced in August 1931. On January 4, 1935, the 36-year-old Vanderbilt married Helen Virginia Varner (1908‚Äì1979), who was 26, after meeting her in Albuquerque, New Mexico three years earlier while he was writing a novel and she was sketching. She was the daughter of Dr. H. V. Varner of Clarksburg, West Virginia, and the former wife of Noah ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù Anderson, a West Virginia high school athletic coach. They divorced in 1940. She later married Jack Frye, founder of TWA.Sedona Legend Helen Frye In 1946, he married Maria Feliza Pablos (b. 1912), heiress to a vast cattle estate in Mexico. She was a grandniece of Porfirio Diaz (1830‚Äì1915), the former President of Mexico, and a granddaughter of Dr. Francisco Castillo N√°jera (1886‚Äì1954), the former Mexican Ambassador to the United States. They divorced on April 29, 1948. Later that same year on September 7, 1948, the 50 year-old Vanderbilt married Patricia Murphy Wallace (b. 1920), who was 28, at the Pickwick Arms Hotel in Greenwich, Connecticut. Patricia was previously married to Earl Wallace, a Hollywood photographer. They divorced in 1953. In 1957, the 59 year-old Vanderbilt married Anna Bernadetta Needham (b. 1933), his 25-year-old secretary. Among the guests at the wedding, which took place at the home of his lawyer, John Sinai, were Charles H. Russell, the Governor of Nevada, and George W. Malone, U.S. Senator of Nevada. They divorced on May 5, 1960. In 1967, Vanderbilt, now 69, married Mary Lou Gardiner Bristol (b. 1926), who was 41, in Reno, Nevada. She was previously married to Albert S. Bristol of Terrell, Texas, with whom she had three children. They remained married to until his death in 1974. Death and burial Cornelius Vanderbilt IV died on July 7, 1974, aged 76, in Reno, Nevada and was buried in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum in the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island.

During the Great Patriotic War (WWII), he was evacuated with his family to Novokuznetsk, where his mother, Etel Viktorovna Gerts, was a prominent cardiologist and head of the cardiology department in a hospital for wounded soldiers. His father, Samuil Mikhaylovich Berkovsky, was drafted and mobilized on the first day of the war, serving in the infantry.

The \\"Divine Light Mission\\" cult in the United States changed its name to Elan Vital in 1983, by filing an entity name change.Colorado Secretary of State, Business Center. According to the Encyclopedia of American Religions, the mission was disbanded [when] Prem Rawat personally renounced the trappings of Indian culture and religion, to make his teachings independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles.Melton, Gordon, Encyclopedia of American Religions 7th edition. Thomson (2003) p.2328 \\"In the early 1980s, Maharaj Ji moved to disband the Divine Light Mission and he personally renounced the trappings of Indian culture and religion, disbanding the mission, he founded Elan Vital, an organization to support his future role as teacher.\\" [...] Maharaji had made every attempt to abandon the traditional Indian religious trappings in which the techniques originated and to make his presentation acceptable to all the various cultural settings in which followers live. He sees his teachings as independent of culture, religion, beliefs, or lifestyles, and regularly addresses audiences in places as culturally diverse as India, Japan, Taiwan, the Ivory Coast, Slovenia, Mauritius and Venezuela, as well as North America, Europe and the South Pacific. According to Glen Whittaker, a former spokesperson for the organization in the United Kingdom, Elan Vital no longer has any connection to its originally Hindu or Sikh religious background. The Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements states that Elan Vital insists that it is not a religion and that Maharaji's teachings are independent of culture and by no means bound to the traditions of India. Elan Vital, Inc. in the U.S. is registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It has been labelled a \\"church\\" in reference to its tax status.GuideStar ‚Äì American Express Search ‚Äì ELAN VITAL INC Its 2005 articles of incorporation described its purpose as performing \\"religious, charitable and educational activities\\". The Elan Vital website states that Elan Vital ceased operations in 2010, and has been succeeded by new entities such as Words of Peace International, Inc. History The organization was originally incorporated in the U.S. in 1971 as the Divine Light Mission as a non-profit corporation and in 1974 was recognized as a religious organization by the United States Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3). The organization changed its name to Elan Vital in 1983, by filing an entity name change. Elan Vital states in its website that the name was changed to remove Indian labels and to present Maharaji's message in a manner more congruent with Western culture. The Elan Vital organization in the United Kingdom changed its name to HDSK (Human Development through Self Knowledge) at the end of 2009. In April 2010, the Elan Vital website announced that Elan Vital had stopped collecting donations and would cease operations in 2010, to be succeeded by entities such as Words of Peace International, Inc., a new US 501(c)(3) organization \\"closely aligned with Words of Peace Global (WOPG), the international charitable foundation that promotes Maharaji‚Äôs message of peace\\".  Purpose  The United States Elan Vital organization provided support for the dissemination and archiving of materials containing Prem Rawat's message. They say that their materials reach a global audience in 80 countries in more than 60 languages. They also state that Prem Rawat receives no compensation from Elan Vital, and that the organization is supported by voluntary contributions and sales of its materials. The Elan Vital organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia are a registered charity and a non-profit, respectively, with aims and objectives similar to their U.S. counterpart. There are also Elan Vital organizations in Spain and Switzerland. Persons who have been taught Maharaji's techniques can apply and receive a Smartcard, issued by Elan Vital in the U.S., that is used to facilitate admittance to events in which the techniques of Knowledge are reviewed, or to gain access to events designed specifically for people that have received such techniques.

Re-christened Fix & Foxi, it was relaunched as a monthly magazine in 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively. Since the end of 2010, publication has once again ceased. During its heyday it was one of the most successful German comics magazines.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm History of the comic In 1947, Rolf Kauka founded Kauka Publishing. In May 1953 his first comic book, Till Eulenspiegel, appeared. The characters in the comic book were loosely based on German folklore. Apart from the legendary jokester as the main character, it featured an adaptation of Baron Munchausen as well as animal characters such as Reineke Fuchs (Reynard the Fox) and Isegrim Wolf (Isengrin).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm In issue number 6 the fox characters Fix and Foxi first appeared in a short comic story. They soon became the favorites of the readers and from issue number 29 the comic book was retitled Fix und Foxi.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm Apart from Germany, Kauka found experienced illustrators in Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain. Over the years, they created more than 80 different comic characters under his supervision (for the most important ones see list below). Kauka also published series from other countries, mainly France/Belgium, giving them their first big break in Germany and popularizing them. Fix und Foxi was published weekly in Germany with a circulation up to 400,000 per week in the magazine's heyday. Allegedly, a total of over 750 million comic books were sold internationally. Kauka's foxes also appeared in magazine spin-offs, pocket books and albums.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm In 1973, Kauka sold his publishing house and Fix und Foxi was published by others, though he retained creative control. Bauer/VPM eventually became the publisher. In 1994 the comic series was retooled by the publishers into an adolescent tabloid magazine and the publication was changed from weekly to monthly. At this point Rolf Kauka withdrew the publishing rights and stopped all publication of the series. From 1993 to 1998 Norbert Hethke Verlag produced reprints of the first 50 comic books. From 1997 to 1999 seven comic albums of classic comics were produced by Ehapa, the erstwhile Kauka rival. In 2000, there was a short-lived revival of the comic book by Ehapa, but it was discontinued after only the third issue due to insufficient sales. In 2005, the magazine was again relaunched by Tigerpress Verlag, Hamburg, a part of the Gruner & Jahr publishing house from the Bertelsmann Group. Shortly after, Tigerpress had faced bankruptcy in 2009, the magazine was once again relaunched, this time by New Ground Publishing, which went into liquidation at the end of 2010.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm In the last years of his life, Kauka began planning the Fix & Foxi TV series together with his wife, Alexandra Kauka. He also planned (in collaboration with the Ravensburger Corporation) Fix & Foxi Adventure Land in the Ravensburger Spieleland theme park. The Fix & Foxi and Friends TV series, first broadcast in Germany in February 2000, found its way into 30 countries. Following Kauka's passing in 2000, his estate controlled the characters. German children's media company Your Family Entertainment acquired the rights to his works, including Fix & Foxi, in 2014. Characters The two main characters of the comic are the twin fox brothers, Fix and Foxi, who live in Fuxholzen (Foxburg in the TV series).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kauka_rolf.htm They are open-minded, agile and caring, and therefore, serve as role models for their young audience. =Side characters= * Hops (rabbit), Stops (hedgehog), and the latter's nephews Stips, Staps and Stups (hedgehogs). * Lupinchen (wolf) - Eusebia's granddaughter, cousin to Fix, Foxi and Lupo. She's crazy about pop music, fashion, etc. * Lupo (wolf) - a bit of a slacker who lives in a tower, and a gluttonous ne'er-do-well (particularly for Oma Eusebia's cakes) who is a true master at the art of enjoying life. * Oma Eusebia (wolf) - an ‚Äúold maid‚Äù, who is also somewhat of a mother-figure for the others. Expert in baking cakes, she's also expert in keeping Lupo away from them. * Onkel Fax (fox) - Fix and Foxi's bachelor uncle, with whom they live. The ex-Staff Sergeant (at least that's what he claims) is a passionate stamp collector who also dabbles in second-hand items. * Professor Knox (raven) - the typical absent-minded professor and ingenious inventor. =Other Kauka characters= * Diabolino - a mischievous little devil who usually sides with the little people against ruffians, troublemakers and do-no-gooders. * Die Pichelsteiner - a Stone Age family clan. * Fridolin (cat), Daggi (goose) and Pieps (mouse). * Mischa - spaceman of the future. * Pauli (mole), Mausi (mouse), Mimi (Pauli's girlfriend). Pauli is Kauka's second most successful and durable creation. In the early days, the mole interacted with the Fix & Foxi family, but eventually got his own \\"universe\\" from 1958 onwards, when he moved back to his parents in Maulwurfshausen. * Tom und Klein Biberherz (Tom & Small Beaver Heart) - A teenage cowboy and his little Indian companion living their adventures in the Wild West, along with Tom's elderly, grumpy and crotchety uncle Nikodemus.

She was laid down 31 January 1944 by Brown Shipbuilding of Houston, Texas, launched 9 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. M. W. Dufilho, widow of Lieutenant Dufilho, and commissioned 21 July 1944, Commander A. H. Nienau, USNR, in command. USS Dufilho escorted with Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet embarked on a tour of inspection of the Caribbean naval bases between 18 September and 19 October 1944. After a voyage to Casablanca, French Morocco, as escort for from 24 October to 14 November, Dufilho sailed from Norfolk 7 December for the Pacific, passed through the Panama Canal on 17 December, crossed the equator on 20 December, and arrived at Manus, Admiralty Islands, 15 January 1945. History Dufilho got underway for Leyte on 23 January 1945 but was diverted to Morotai to join the escort for a convoy of 80 tank landing ships (LSTs) bound with reinforcements of men and supplies for Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. She patrolled there on 9 and 10 February while the men and supplies were unloaded, then sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 14 February. She continued to escort supply convoys from Morotai and Leyte to Subic Bay and Lingayen Gulf until the 27th when she was assigned to the San Bernardino-Verde Islands Minesweeping unit guarding minecraft as they cleared the sea lane to Manila, as well as taking part in naval and amphibious operations along this route. Arriving at Subic Bay 6 March, Dufilho operated on anti-submarine patrol and escort duty. Between 26 April and 5 July 1945, Dufilho joined in the Borneo operation, escorting shipping from the Philippines and Mios Woendi to Morotai in preparation for the landings at Tarakan and Brunei Bay in May and June. She convoyed reinforcements to Tarakan, and patrolled off the beaches during the assaults at Brunei Bay, escorted support troops in, and returned with empty landing craft to San Pedro Bay. After brief overhaul, Dufilho patrolled out of Leyte on antisubmarine, air-sea rescue, weather reporting and escort duty. On 2 August 1945 she aided in the rescue of survivors from .

Concerned the Japanese submarine might still be lurking in the area, Dufilho attacked with depth charges and hedgehogs. After 20 minutes with no evidence of a destroyed submarine, Dufilho picked up the whaleboat and survivor and commenced screening for the rescue operation until 1615 the following afternoon, when she was released to return to Leyte. Following a voyage to Okinawa to convoy LSTs and LSMs to Leyte for repairs, Dufilho sailed from Leyte 6 September and after calling at Okinawa, arrived at Shanghai 22 September, the first ship to enter Shanghai harbor in four years.

He is the frontman for the Boston-area bands Dispatch and State Radio, and released solo music under the name Chadwick Stokes. Early life and education Chadwick Stokes Urmston was born February 26, 1976, in Boston, Massachusetts, into a large family. He graduated from Dover-Sherborn High School in 1994, and went on to attend both Middlebury College and NYU. During this time, Urmston briefly lived in Zimbabwe, where he befriended a local fieldworker named Elias. Later, Urmston wrote a song titled \\"Elias\\" for Dispatch's 1996 album \\"Silent Steeples\\", which became one of their most well known songs. Many of his songs also reference where he grew up going in the summer, West Chop, Massachusetts. Career See Dispatch for a complete history of the band. In 1995, while attending Middlebury College, Urmston met Pete Heimbold and formed the band Hermit Thrush. He later formed a band called One Fell Swoop with Heimbold and Brad Corrigan; this group would ultimately become known as Dispatch. They quickly gained a huge grassroots college following and achieved unprecedented success in the music industry independent of the standard record label control. The band promoted its own tours and music with the help of early file sharing services like Napster to reach thousands of fans. In this manner, they achieved stardom without the typical assistance of album singles played on major radio stations. Chad Urmston with Dispatch in Germany, Hamburg, 2012 In 2004, Dispatch performed a final show at the Hatch Shell in Boston, before taking a long hiatus. Though the band, and the Boston Police Department, expected a crowd of about 20,000, the show attracted over 110,000 fans from all over the world. The Dispatch hiatus lasted almost a decade. It ended in the beginning of 2011, when the band announced a national tour. With State Radio, Urmston focused exclusively on guitar and vocals rather than switching instruments as he did with Dispatch. Lyrically, State Radio songs are heavily influenced by politics and social issues as opposed to most Dispatch songs. State Radio originally, under their first name Flag of the Shiners, consisted of second guitarist Pete Halby, bassist Chuck Fay, and drummer Mike Greenfield. After their debut self- titled EP \\"Flag of the Shiners\\" was released by Fenway Recordings in late 2002, the band went on a temporary hiatus throughout 2003 as Urmston recovered from throat surgery. Flag of the Shiners reformed as State Radio in 2004 and began to tour consecutively throughout the next decade with various band line ups. Their second EP \\"Simmer Kane\\" was released in March 2004. It was a vast departure in style from their concurrent live show and their first EP in featuring acoustic instead of heavy electric guitar, quieter more folk-like song writing and Urmston was assisted with vocals by Erin Lashnits Coughlin aka \\"Ras LC\\". The album closely resembled Urmston's later solo work rather than anything performed by State Radio or Dispatch at the time, and indeed was re-released under the solo moniker in August 2012. In late 2004, the group slimmed-down to a trio with new drummer Brian Sayers. Following the December 2005 release of State Radio's first full-length album, \\"Us Against the Crown,\\" drummer Michael Najarian replaced Brian Sayers. Between 2006 and 2012, State Radio released four studio albums, five EPs and three live EP albums. However, although the Live at the Sync EP and Live from the Brattle Theatre releases are made up predominantly of State Radio songs, they are Chad Stokes solo acoustic performance albums. For two of the band's final tours, in 2011 and 2012, they were joined by Matt Embree of the Rx Bandits on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2012 they recorded a covers EP with Embree vocal overdubs that remains unreleased. In 2006, Urmston collaborated with Boston local punk band Plan b to record the track \\"Bandwagon\\" from their sophomore release Welcome! Generations. In 2007, State Radio began the tradition of launching service projects in each city the band visited. Service projects have become a staple of Urmston's performances. He brought the tradition to Dispatch when the band reunited and encourages service projects and fundraisers in each city where he performs solo. In December 2007, Urmston briefly reconvened with Dispatch for a sold out three-night charity performance at Madison Square Garden, with funds going toward Zimbabwe relief. The band reunited in 2011 and has since performed throughout the United States and Europe. They have since released two EPs and two LPs, as well as a double live album and a DVD. In June 2011, Urmston released a solo album entitled \\"Simmerkane II\\" under the name Chadwick Stokes and launched a solo tour to promote it. In 2012, Urmston released \\"Simmerkane I,\\" a collection of acoustic material and early recording including three songs named for his wife and tour manager, Sybil Gallagher. Three years later, after albums with State Radio and Dispatch each, Urmston released his second full-length solo-album, called \\"The Horse Comanche\\" in February 2015. Through a series of \\"Living Room\\" concerts, Urmston partially crowdsourced the album. Eight of the album's ten tracks were co-produced by Sam Beam, better known by his stage moniker Iron & Wine, and Beam's frequent collaborator Brian Deck. Urmston used the Iron & Wine band for the sessions. The remaining two tracks, \\"Our Lives Our Time\\" and \\"I Want You Like a Seatbelt,\\" were produced by Noah Georgeson. In 2016, Urmston released \\"The Story of Bobby & Maeve\\", a collection of B-sides from The Horse Comanche. In September 2013, it was announced on State Radio's website and on their Facebook page that Mike \\"Maddog\\" Najarian had left State Radio to pursue a career in finance. Chad wrote, \\"Above all, he drummed his ass off every night and it was an honor to share the stage with him and feel that mac truck energy coming from the kit.\\" In the media In 2010, State Radio won Best Social Action Song from the 9th Annual Independent Music Awards for \\"Calling All Crows\\" Activism Urmston writes the majority of his songs about historical and contemporary social issues, and advocates social change in many of his songs. Alongside his Dispatch band members, Urmston formed the nonprofit Elias Fund to sponsor community development and education in Zimbabwe, including scholarships in the name of both of Elias's children. After creating the Elias Fund, Urmston also formed the Dispatch Foundation, which helps to address social and economic problems in Zimbabwe and the Calling All Crows organization which works to empower women across the globe. He is also involved in the Amplifying Education organization, which helps provide schools in need of critical resources. Urmston was honored as Humanitarian of the Year by the Boston Music Awards in 2008. =Elias Fund= The story behind the song \\"Elias\\" written by Urmston about his experience living and teaching in Zimbabwe inspired the nonprofit organization the Elias Fund to form in 2005. The Elias Fund looks to provide hope and opportunity to Zimbabwean youth through community development and education while empowering the American youth culture to embrace their global role and make it an active one. =Dispatch Foundation= In 2007, The Dispatch Foundation was created following the Dispatch Madison Square Garden Reunion benefit concerts. The organization works to address the deep-seated social and economic problems plaguing Zimbabwe such as inflation, starvation, unemployment and HIV/AIDS. =Calling All Crows= In 2008, State Radio started an activist group called Calling All Crows to \\"inspire public service\\" and \\"promote human rights.\\" Currently, they are working with Oxfam America's Stoves for Sudan Project. Calling All Crows is hoping to raise money for 5,000 stoves for 5,000 different women in Sudan through fan activism before concerts. =Amplifying Education= The three members of Dispatch founded the non-profit, Amplifying Education, to encourage volunteers to take on simple actions to help improve schools and support education. The campaign works with the Calling All Crows non-profit to organize tour projects. It has worked with more than 600 fan volunteers working nearly 4,000 hours to improve schools in North America and Europe. The band has also collected more than 10,000 donated books for Better World Books and has raised more than $250,000 to support local organizations.

Radio Clyde is owned and operated by Bauer Radio, based at studios in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire and forms part of Bauer's City network of local stations.  History  Radio Clyde began broadcasting as the commercial radio station in Scotland at 10.30pm on Monday 31 December 1973. first ILR station outside London on 261 metres medium wave and 95.1 FM (later moving to 102.5 FM). The station's studios were originally located at the Anderston Centre complex within Glasgow city centre, but moved to its current site at Clydebank in 1983. The original slogan was Radio Clyde, 261, all together now. Radio Clyde's output was split into two distinct services on Friday 12 August 1988 with the launch of a separate Clyde FM service carrying chart music at weekends. The split became permanent on Wednesday 3 January 1990 with the AM service carrying a classic hits format. In line with other UK stations, by this time the AM broadcast was advertised by its frequency of 1152kHz rather than its equivalent wavelength of 261 meters. Radio Clyde was controlled by Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH) until 2005, when the company was acquired by Emap. It changed hands again in 2008 when Emap sold their consumer magazines and radio business units to current owner Bauer Media. A third service was launched on Monday 19 January 2015 as Clyde 3, carrying a locally branded version of The Hits on DAB with opt-outs for local news, traffic and advertising. From 1 September 2017, the local City 3 branding of the stations on DAB was withdrawn, in favour of reverting to using The Hits name. A fourth station Clyde Rocks was launched as a 30-day trial on Wednesday 20 April 2016, with the intention of the outcome of the trial being used to form a bid for the 96.3 FM radio licence which had recently been vacated by its former operator, XFM Scotland. Ultimately, however, Bauer Radio were unsuccessful in their bid, and, the licence was awarded by Ofcom to another bidder, Rock Radio. Notable past presenters include Ross King who was the station's youngest ever DJ and is now based in Hollywood where he appears regularly on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine. Ross is a four time Emmy Award winning TV host, actor, writer and producer. Paul Coia, Ken Sykora, Richard Park, Tiger Tim Stevens, Mark Goodier, Tom Russell who presented the long running Friday Night Rock Show and Dougie Donnelly. BBC Breakfast anchor Bill Turnbull began his career in journalism at the station.  Present  Radio Clyde forms one of Bauer's main radio production centres. As well as local programming for Glasgow and the West of Scotland - predominantly on Clyde 1 - the station also produces networked programming for the three City networks in Scotland and northern England. The station's newsroom is also one of the largest in commercial radio, producing local and national bulletins as well as extensive sports coverage, including live football commentaries and a nightly phone-in under the Superscoreboard banner.

The governing body in Northern Ireland is the Irish Football Association (IFA) (not to be confused with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in the Republic of Ireland). Gaelic football, rugby union and association football are the most popular sports in Northern Ireland.  Governing body  The Irish Football Association is the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, and was historically the governing body for the whole of the Ireland until the FAI split away. The IFA has a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board, which is responsible for the laws of the game. The Northern Ireland Women's Football Association (NIWFA) is the IFA's women's football arm. It runs a Women's Cup, Women's League and the Northern Ireland women's national football team. Competitions The domestic league is the IFA Premiership. Some of the major teams include Portadown FC, Glentoran FC and Linfield FC (although Derry City play in the FAI's League of Ireland). A notable historic club was Belfast Celtic, which won nineteen championships before resigning from the league and disbanding after a sectarian riot at its Boxing Day match against Linfield. Derry City FC also left the league following security issues arising from the Troubles, eventually to play in the League of Ireland. Linfield has won 54 league championships to date, more than twice as many titles as any other Northern Irish club and the highest tally of national top-flight titles won by any club worldwide. The Milk Cup is a successful international youth tournament held annually in Northern Ireland, in which clubs and national teams from anywhere in the world may compete. Northern Ireland also played host to the 2005 UEFA Under-19 European Championships. The Setanta Sports Cup was set up by its sponsors, television channel Setanta Ireland. It is an all- island tournament (two groups of four, then semis and final) featuring eight teams, four being from the League of Ireland and four from the Irish League. Despite fairly low turnouts for each jurisdiction's leagues, the Setanta Cup drew relatively successful gate receipts and in its three-year existence has had one winner from the North (Linfield in 2005). National team The Northern Ireland national football team is one of the oldest international teams in the world, it was founded in 1880. It originally played as the Ireland national team until 1950 with players selected from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and competed in the British Home Championship which it won eight times. Northern Ireland joined FIFA in 1911, and UEFA in 1954. The team enjoyed a period of success in the early and mid-80s in which it qualified for two World Cups, most notably in the 1982 tournament in which it topped Group 5 above Spain, Yugoslavia and Honduras to proceed to the second round. After a poor run of form in the late 1990s and first few years of the 21st century, and a corresponding slump in the FIFA World Rankings, there was a subsequent revival in the team's fortunes with home wins over Spain and England. The team came close to qualifying for the 2008 European Championships, and took part in the Nations Cup competition in 2011 along with Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland qualified for UEFA Euro 2016, progressing through the group stage and reaching the round of 16. In 2018, the national team began their UEFA Nations League debut, in league B. Problems Sectarian tensions have long been a cause of conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland, and crowd trouble marred games throughout the twentieth century. In 1949, Belfast Celtic withdrew from the Irish League after years of sectarian crowd problems culminated in a Boxing Day match against Linfield at Windsor Park which ended in a pitch invasion and riot in which Belfast Celtic's Protestant centre forward, Jimmy Jones, suffered a broken leg. Since 1968, Cronin argues that the sport has failed to include the Catholic community with Catholic clubs being either forced out of existence or transferring their allegiance to the FAI. Hooliganism and sectarianism have remained problems throughout the Troubles and up to the present day. Northern Ireland football grounds have been described as \\"useful sites of public displays of political affiliation\\", and internal divisions between groups involved in political violence in the mid-1990s was reflected in the supporters of various clubs. Incidents of violence include trouble after Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket fired from the crowd, and disturbances between Linfield and Glentoran fans at the 2008 Boxing Day match between the two clubs. In addition to problems in domestic football, the Northern Ireland international team has also suffered from sectarian problems. In 2002 Celtic player Neil Lennon announced that he would no longer play for Northern Ireland because he received a death threat, and death threats appeared on the walls of loyalist areas including in his home town of Lurgan, Co Armagh.

It is the story of New York City police officer (Cage) who wins the lottery and splits his winnings with a waitress (Fonda). This basic premise was inspired by a real-life incident.Mark, Lois Alter. (1994, July 29). \\"Winning Personalities\\", Entertainment Weekly Isaac Hayes has a role as undercover reporter and photographer Angel Dupree, while also being the film's narrator. The film was remade in Hindi as Bade Dilwala, which was released in 1999 and in Telugu as Bahumati in 2007. Plot NYPD officer Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage) is a kind and generous man who loves his job in Queens, New York, where he lives. His wife, Muriel (Rosie Perez), works at a hair salon and, unlike him, is greedy, materialistic, and selfish, constantly complaining about their situation in life. Waitress Yvonne Biasi (Bridget Fonda) is bankrupt because her husband, Eddie (Stanley Tucci), whom she could not yet afford to divorce, emptied their joint checking account without her permission, while also leaving her with over $12,000 in credit card debt. Charlie meets her when she waits on him at the diner where she works. Since he doesn't have enough money to pay the tip, he promises to give her either double the tip or half of his prospective lottery winnings the next day using a ticket which has numbers he regularly plays. He wins $4 million ($ million today) in the lottery the next day and keeps his promise, despite Muriel's protests. He and Yvonne become stars almost immediately. She buys the diner and sets up a table with his name at which people who can't afford a meal can eat for free. In another development, he becomes a hero for foiling an attempted robbery at a grocery store but gets wounded in the process, forcing him to take a leave of absence from the police force. Meanwhile, Muriel goes on a shopping spree, and also contracts for disruptive renovations to their apartment without consulting him. At a gathering on a chartered boat for the lottery winners and other members of high society, Muriel meets the newly rich Jack Gross (Seymour Cassel). She flirts with him, listens to his advice on financial investments, and develops a strong liking for him, which is mutual. Meanwhile, Charlie and Yvonne, accidentally left behind on the pier, spend a lot of time together, on one occasion paying for the train journeys of subway passengers, and on another treating the neighborhood children to a day out at Yankee Stadium, about which the media report. Muriel gets fed up with his constant donations and overall simplicity and throws him out of their apartment, asking for a divorce. That same evening, Yvonne leaves her apartment after Eddie shows up and threatens to stay until he gets $50,000 from her. Quite innocently, she and Charlie run into each other at the Plaza Hotel and, unintentionally, end up spending the night together. During divorce proceedings between Muriel and Charlie, she demands all the money that he won for herself. He doesn't mind giving his share of it but she also wants the amount he gave Yvonne, and his steadfast unwillingness to do so causes her to take the case to court. Muriel lies in court about the numbers Charlie played to win the ticket, but doesn't get caught. The jury believing her narrative decides in her favor. Yvonne, feeling guilty at costing him all his money, runs out in tears and tries to keep away from him. But he, by now hopelessly in love with her, finds her at the diner and tells her that the money means nothing to him, and they declare their love for each other. While ruminating about their future at the diner and considering a possible move to Buffalo, they graciously provide a hungry and poor customer with some soup, which he eats at the special table. He is none other than disguised reporter Angel Dupree (Isaac Hayes), who takes photos of them and in the next day's newspapers publicly eulogises their willingness to feed a hungry and poor man even in their darkest hour. Just as they are moving out of town, the citizens of New York City, touched by their generosity, send them thousands of letters with tips totaling over $600,000 ($ today), enough to help pay their debts. After Muriel gets remarried to her new husband, Jack Gross, he flees the country with all the money from their checking account, revealing himself to be a con man. She then has no option but to move in with her mother in the Bronx and go back to her old manicure job. Eddie, now divorced from Yvonne, can only get a job as a taxi driver. Charlie happily returns to the NYC police force and Yvonne reclaims the diner. At the film's end, they get married and begin their honeymoon by taking off from Central Park in a hot air balloon that bears the New York Post headline \\"Cop Weds Waitress\\", just before the closing credits roll.

In March of that year, Officer Robert Cunningham, a regular patron and longtime friend of Penzo, suggested that the two split a lottery ticket, each of them choosing three of the six numbers, in lieu of his leaving her a tip. Penzo agreed, and though she subsequently forgot about it, when Cunningham discovered that the ticket had won a $6 million prize, he honored their verbal agreement and split the money evenly with Penzo. Beyond this basic premise, the film is entirely fictional, with the backgrounds of the film's characters and the events depicted in the film subsequent to their lottery win bearing no resemblance to the actual lives of Penzo and Cunningham. As a result, neither Penzo nor Cunningham were required to authorize the film, nor were they entitled to collect royalties from its proceeds.David, Will. (2004, June 26). \\"Lottery spouse dies in roof fall\\", The Journal News The closing credits of the film include a disclaimer stating that although the film was inspired by actual events, at the time of production both Penzo and Cunningham were happily married to their respective spouses. Production The diner where Yvonne works in the film was constructed in a parking lot at the corner of N. Moore St. and West Broadway in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan.

The PMO strives to standardize and introduce economies of repetition in the execution of projects. The PMO is the source of documentation, guidance and metrics on the practice of project management and execution. Darling & Whitty (2016) note the definition of the PMO's function has evolved over time: * The 1800s project office was a type of national governance of the agricultural industry * 1939 appears as the earliest instance of the term 'project management office' being published * The 1950s concept of the PMO is representative of what a contemporary PMO looks like * Today the PMO is a dynamic entity used to solve specific issues Often PMOs base project management principles on industry- standard methodologies such as PRINCE2 or guidelines such as PMBOK . Performance There are many reasons for project failures. As per a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of 1,524 organizations, inadequate project estimating and planning constitutes 30% of project failures, lack of executive sponsorship constitutes 16% and poorly defined goals and objectives constitutes 12%. It also found that using established project management approaches increased success as measured by a project's key performance indicators of quality, scope, schedule, budgets and benefits. The survey indicates that operating an established PMO is one of the top three reasons that drives successful project delivery. Darling & Whitty (2016) found there is complexity of interconnections in PMO intellectual capital and though often the rationale for PMO establishment is to enhance stakeholder satisfaction with projects often the establishment of the PMO leads to significant dissatisfaction by senior management. Functions PMOs may take other functions beyond standards and methodology, and participate in strategic project management either as facilitator or actively as owner of the Portfolio Management process. Tasks may include monitoring and reporting on active projects and portfolios (following up project until completion), and reporting progress to top management for strategic decisions on what projects to continue or cancel. The degree of control and influence that PMOs have on projects depend on the type of PMO structure within the enterprise; it can be: * Supportive, with a consultative role * Controlling, by requiring compliance for example * Directive, by taking control and managing the projects There are many opinions and practices some say PMOs must fulfill. The PMBoK 5th edition dedicates a page and a half to such discussion identifying 6 PMO functions. Hobbs & Aubry (2010) identified 27 distinct functions of PMOs highlighting a number of these were found to not correlate to enhanced project performance. Darling & Whitty (2016) state there is a need for evidence-based management practice, that consultants and practitioners are providing unproven solutions which organisations both public and private are investing enormous quantities of finance to without assured outcome, further the publication of opinions without scientific basis in the field of science, medicine or law would not be tolerated, and it is equally important for justification to be presented in the management field. Some PMOs operate in specialist contexts. In the Scaled Agile Framework the term APMO is used to define a PMO with a focus on supporting business agility. PMO departments change frequently and for a variety of reasons. Research indicates changes to portfolio management and methods, collaboration and accountability; project management maturity and performance; and work climate are all factors that drive PMO change.https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-office- dynamics-change-6496 Aubry, M., Hobbs, J. B., M√ºller, R., & Blomquist, T. (2010). Identifying forces driving PMO changes. Paper presented at PMI¬Æ Research Conference: Defining the Future of Project Management, Washington, DC. Newtown Square, PA: Project Management Institute. Whilst PMO functions change through frequent transformations, it is argued that the core function of the PMO is to act as a catalyst for change and delivery within organizations Malik, I. (2014). PMO managed services model. Paper presented at PMI¬Æ Global Congress 2014‚ÄîNorth America, Phoenix, AZ. Newtown Square, PA: Project Management Institute McIntyre, J. (2016). Project Management Office (PMO) as a Catalyst Types There are a range of PMO types, including: * Enterprise PMO: ensures that projects align with the organization strategy and objective; these have the broadest remit of all PMO types, typically reporting direct to the CEO (or similar role), and have authority to make strategic and tactical decisions across all projects. * Divisional PMO: provides support to projects for a specific business unit within an organization; includes portfolio management, training, resource planning, and project coordination. * Project PMO: established for the duration of a single large project or program; includes administrative support, controlling, reporting and monitoring. * Project Management Center of Excellence (PMCoE): defines standardized project management standards, procedures, methods and tools to support project teams across an entire organization; includes administrative services and training in process, methodology, and tools. The Project Management Institute (PMI) Program Management Office Community of Practice (CoP), describes the PMO as a strategic driver for organizational excellence, which seeks to enhance the practices of execution management, organizational governance, and strategic change leadership. Darling & Whitty (2016) highlight many PMO typologies exist from the early 1800s as a collective for running government strategy in the agricultural sector, to the civil infrastructure projects of the early 20th century to the early 2000s when the PMO became a commodity to be traded and traded upon. It would be impossible to group PMO's into specific types (Darling & Whitty, 2016). Whilst the 'P' in PMO usually refers to the word Project, it can also refer to a Programme or Portfolio Management Office. Where Project Management Offices support Projects, Program Management Offices have a broader remit including getting and sustaining the benefits from projects/programs. Portfolio Management Offices have the added responsibility of supporting organizations in achieving strategic goalsAl- Arabi, M. & Al-Sadeq, I. M. (2008).

Early life  He was educated at Epsom College and graduated from King's College London with a degree in law.  Journalism  Maitland started his career as a reporter on The Sutton Guardian. He reported for BBC Radio Bristol and BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was also a general correspondent for BBC News. From 1995‚Äì98 he presented and produced factual shows on BBC 1. A report about annoying dress codes at golf clubs saw him take to the fairways in a black leather mini skirt and a pair of deer antlers. When challenged he pointed out that neither breached the long list of forbidden clothing. In 1999 he joined ITV to present BAFTA winning current affairs show 'Tonight' and the BAFTA nominated 'House Of Horrors', the first show to secretly film and expose con artists. As an investigative journalist he exposed companies with questionable practices and values. A documentary on white collar boxing highlighted the risks and looked into training, medical examinations and opponent matching.  Writing  Maitland has written five books including How to Make your Million from the Internet (and what to do if you don't), which explored the dot com boom. How to Survive your Mother described his unconventional childhood in suburban Surrey. Aged three he was sent to boarding school and at 13 his mother turned the family hotel in Ewell into a retreat for homosexuals. The rights were bought by ITV but no film was made. His play Dead Sheep, about the Geoffrey Howe speech which led to Margaret Thatcher's downfall, was staged at Park Theatre in London in 2015. It received positive reviews and the Independent called it a \\"...fine, often very funny debut play.\\" It became the most successful production in the theatre's history and went on a national tour in 2016. His follow up at the Park, An Audience With Jimmy Savile, broke the previous records set by Dead Sheep. The Daily Mail's theatre critic Quentin Letts called it: \\"a striking, memorable, urgent piece of work ...a powerful ‚Äò j'accuse'‚Äù. The Observer described the play‚Äôs central performance by Alistair McGowan as ‚ÄúUncanny‚Ä¶creepily powerful‚Ä¶shocking.‚Äù His third play, \\"Deny Deny Deny\\", about medical and ethical dilemmas, was also staged at the Park. The Telegraph called it \\"a gripping, Faustian take on Olympic doping.\\" The Hungarian version, \\"Tagadj Tagadj Tagadj\\", opened in September 2017. In May 2019 his play The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson opened at the Park Theatre. Its two acts looked at how Boris Johnson missed out on the Conservative Party leadership to Theresa May in July 2016 stemming from a February dinner party at his home in Islington with Michael Gove. The second act looks to a future 2029 when he is tempted to make another run at the leadership taking the UK back into the EU. The play broke previous box office records and sold out its entire run but received mixed reviews; Ann Treneman in The Times gave the play four stars out of five, calling it 'politics...served deliciously pink'. In the New European, Martin McQuillan praised Maitland's 'remarkable play' with a five-star review, but Michael Billington in the Guardian gave it two stars, concluding that ‚Äú Maitland‚Äôs mind-changing hero is not nearly as interesting as he thinks he is.‚Äù The play completed an eight week national tour in March 2020.  Other appearances  Maitland part funded Chris Morris's debut feature film Four Lions (2010) in which he has a cameo as a newsreader. He also presented 'Profile' and two series of 'Lyrical Journey', both for Radio 4. The latter, which he devised, takes musicians to a place they have written a song about. They then perform it in front of people for whom it has special significance. The series featured songs by the Proclaimers, Squeeze and Billy Bragg.  Personal life  Maitland's mother Berouia was born in Palestine and his father Ivor in Hackney. Maitland played bass in a covers band, \\"Surf 'n Turf\\", for several years. He runs a cricket team, the Riverbank Ramblers, which he founded in 1989 with friends from Epsom College. He is a nationally rated Scrabble player and has made the semi-finals of the UK National Championships twice. He lives in west London with his wife Helena and their son Manny. He has two stepsons.

It was defined by Brodmann in the guenon monkey . While Brodmann, writing in 1909, argued that no equivalent structure existed in humans, later work demonstrated that area 14 has a clear homologue in the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Anatomy Brodmann areas were defined based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. Area 14 differs most clearly from Brodmann area 13-1905 in that it lacks a distinct internal granular layer (IV). Other differences are a less distinct external granular layer (II), a widening of the relatively cell-free zone of the external pyramidal layer (III); cells in the internal pyramidal layer (V) are denser and rounded; and the cells of the multiform layer (VI) assume a more distinct tangential orientation Function According to one theory, Area 14 is believed to serve as association cortex for the visceral senses and olfaction along with Area 51.

For clarinets, which overblow on odd harmonics, the altissimo notes are those based on the fifth, seventh, and higher harmonics. For other woodwinds, the altissimo notes are those based on the third, fourth, and higher harmonics. The altissimo register is also known as the high register. Flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon On the Boehm system flute, the first altissimo note, D6, is played using the third harmonic of G4. Fourth harmonics are used for D6 through G6, and notes from A6 through C7 are played with fifth or sixth harmonics. A careful examination of the flute fingering for the notes D6 through G6 reveals that they are actually a combination of third and fourth harmonic fingerings. For example, the D fingering is like the low D4 with the addition of the G key vented, for which D6 is the third harmonic. Similarly, in the third octave, the E is a combination of E and A fingerings, the F is a combination of F and B, et cetera. On the oboe, third harmonics are mainly used. On clarinets, fifth harmonics are used for the first half dozen notes above (written) C6; seventh and ninth harmonics are used beyond that. For bassoons, the altissimo notes bear complicated harmonic relationships to the fundamental register. Saxophone Saxophone altissimo is generally considered to be any note that is higher than written high F which is considered to be the highest note in the saxophone's regular range. Altissimo is produced by the player using various voicing techniques such as air stream, tongue, throat and embouchure variations to disturb the fundamental of a note which results in one of the higher overtones dominating. In classical music, altissimo playing is considered a necessary skill for saxophonists, and much of the modern concert saxophone repertoire utilizes the altissimo range. A notable proponent of the altissimo range was Sigurd Rasch√®r, who preferred the term top tones. Rasch√®r is also the author of \\"Top Tones For the Saxophone\\", which is the most widely used and known method book for training saxophonists how to perform in the upper and altissimo register of the saxophone. In jazz music, use of altissimo is common, especially among avant-garde players, though one of its earliest practitioners was the swing player, Earl Bostic. Altissimo technique and the use of multiphonics are prominent in the influential work of Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane during the 1960s, as well as in the work of Lenny Pickett, Ron Holloway, Scott Page, Michael Brecker and Chris Potter. Low note overtones are similar to altissimo but mostly result in a lower pitch than written high F. For example, it is possible to use a low B fingering to produce a series of higher overtones by using air stream, tongue, throat and embouchure variations. The more difficult task of producing a complete chromatic scale in the altissimo register should not be confused with squeals and other sound effects that are produced by biting on the reed with the lower teeth.

It is formed in the intestines by bacterial action on bilirubin. About half of the urobilinogen formed is reabsorbed and taken up via the portal vein to the liver, enters circulation and is excreted by the kidney. Increased amounts of bilirubin are formed in hemolysis, which generates increased urobilinogen in the gut. In liver disease (such as hepatitis), the intrahepatic urobilinogen cycle is inhibited also increasing urobilinogen levels. Urobilinogen is converted to the yellow pigmented urobilin apparent in urine. The urobilinogen in the intestine is directly reduced to brown stercobilin, which gives the feces their characteristic color. It can also be reduced to stercobilinogen, which can then be further oxidized to stercobilin. This constitutes the normal \\"enterohepatic urobilinogen cycle.\\" In biliary obstruction, below-normal amounts of conjugated bilirubin reach the intestine for conversion to urobilinogen. With limited urobilinogen available for reabsorption and excretion, the amount of urobilin found in the urine is low. High amounts of the soluble conjugated bilirubin enter the circulation where they are excreted via the kidneys. These mechanisms are responsible for the dark urine and pale stools observed in biliary obstruction. Low urine urobilinogen may result from complete obstructive jaundice or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which destroy the intestinal bacterial flora. (Obstruction of bilirubin passage into the gut or failure of urobilinogen production in the gut.) Low urine urobilinogen levels may result from congenital enzymatic jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia syndromes) or from treatment with drugs that acidify urine, such as ammonium chloride or ascorbic acid. Elevated levels may indicate hemolytic anaemia (excessive breakdown of red blood cells RBC), overburdening of the liver, increased urobilinogen production, re-absorption ‚Äì a large hematoma, restricted liver function, hepatic infection, poisoning or liver cirrhosis. Nomenclature Urobilinogen ( D-urobilinogen) is closely related to two other compounds: mesobilirubinogen (a.k.a. I-urobilinogen) and stercobilinogen (a.k.a. L-urobilinogen). Specifically, urobilinogen can be reduced to form mesobilirubinogen, and mesobilirubinogen can be further reduced to form stercobilinogen. Confusingly, however, all three of these compounds are frequently collectively referred to as \\"urobilinogens\\". Measurement Urobilinogen content is determined by a reaction with Ehrlich's reagent, which contains para-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and may be measured in Ehrlich units. Ehrlich's reagent reacts with urobilinogen to give a pink-red color. One Ehrlich unit is equal to one milligram of urobilinogen per deciliter of sample (1 mg/dL).Urobilinogenfrom Information and Courses MediaLab, Inc.

While in CIA custody, he was flown to Afghanistan, where he was held at a black site and routinely interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomized, and subjected to other cruel forms of inhumane and degrading treatment and torture.\\\\- (para. 205) El Masri v. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(para 151) El Masri v. Former Yugoslav Republic of MacedoniaCASE OF EL-MASRI v THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, December 2012 After El-Masri held hunger strikes, and was detained for four months in the \\"Salt Pit\\", the CIA finally admitted his arrest and torture were a mistake and released him. He is believed to be among an estimated 3,000 detainees whom the CIA abducted from 2001‚Äì2005. In May 2004, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Daniel R. Coats, convinced the German interior minister, Otto Schily, not to press charges or to reveal the program. El-Masri filed suit against the CIA for his arrest, extraordinary rendition and torture. In 2006, his suit El Masri v. Tenet, in which he was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, based on the U.S. government's claiming the state secrets privilege. The ACLU said the Bush administration attempted to shield its abuses by invoking this privilege.\\"'El-Masri v. Tenet': Background - State Secrets Privilege\\", ACLU, November 2006, accessed 26 January 2013 The case was also dismissed by the Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit, and in December 2007, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On 13 December 2012, El-Masri won an Article 34 case at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The court determined he had been tortured while held by CIA agents and ruled that Macedonia was responsible for abusing him while in the country, and knowingly transferring him to the CIA when torture was a possibility. It awarded him compensation.Amy Davidson, \\"Torturing the wrong man\\", New Yorker, 13 December 2012Nicholas Kulish, \\"Court Finds Rights Violation in C.I.A.

Personal history El-Masri was born in Kuwait to Lebanese parents. He grew up in Lebanon. He immigrated to Germany in the 1980s during the Lebanese civil war, where he applied for political asylum, based on his membership in the Islamic Unification Movement which had fought against the Lebanese government during the war years.\\"El-Masri a member of El-Tawhid\\", msn.de, February 23, 2006 He was granted asylum. In 1994 he obtained German citizenship through a previous marriage with a German woman, whom he later divorced. In 1996, El-Masri married a Lebanese woman in Ulm, Germany. They have had five children together.\\"Extraordinary Rendition ‚Äì Khaled El-Masri ‚Äì Statement\\", American Civil Liberties Union, June 12, 2005  Abduction and CIA torture in Macedonia  At the end of 2003, El-Masri travelled from his home in Ulm to go on a short vacation in Skopje. He was detained by Macedonian border officials on 31 December 2003, because his name was identical (except for variations in Roman transliteration) to that of Khalid al-Masri, who was being sought as an alleged mentor to the al-Qaeda Hamburg cell, and because of suspicion that El- Masri's German passport was a forgery. He was held in a motel in Macedonia for over three weeks and questioned about his activities, his associates, and the mosque he attended in Ulm. The Macedonian authorities contacted the local CIA station, who in turn contacted the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. According to a 4 December 2005, article in the Washington Post, CIA agents discussed whether they should remove El-Masri from Macedonia in an extraordinary rendition. The decision to do so was made by the head of the al Qaeda division of the CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center, Alfreda Frances Bikowsky, on the basis of \\"a hunch\\" that El-Masri was involved in terrorism; his name was similar to suspected terrorist Khalid al-Masri. When the Macedonian officials released El-Masri on 23 January 2004, American security officers immediately took him into custody and detained him. El-Masri later described them as members of a \\"black snatch team.\\" They beat him and sedated him for transport using a rectal suppository. \\"The CIA stripped, hooded, shackled and sodomized el-Masri with a suppository‚Äîin CIA parlance, subjected him to \\"capture shock\\"‚Äîas Macedonian officials stood by.\\" He was dressed in a diaper and a jumpsuit, with total sensory deprivation, and flown to Baghdad, then immediately to the \\"Salt Pit\\", a black site or covert CIA interrogation center, in Afghanistan. It also held CIA prisoners from Pakistan, Tanzania, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.\\"CIA accused of detaining innocent man: If the agency knew he was the wrong man, why was he held?\\", NBC News, 21 April 2005 'Salt Pit' in Afghanistan After his release, in 2006 El-Masri wrote in the Los Angeles Times that, while held by the CIA in Afghanistan, he was beaten and repeatedly interrogated. He also said that his custodians forcibly inserted an object into his anus. He was kept in a bare, squalid cell, given only meager rations to eat and putrid water to drink. According to a report by the inspector general of the CIA, El-Masri's German passport was not examined for authenticity until three months into his detention. Upon examination, the CIA's Office of Technical Services swiftly concluded it was genuine and that his continued detention would be unjustified. Discussion over what to do with El-Masri included secretly transporting him back to Macedonia and dumping him there without informing German authorities, and denying any claims he made. In March 2004, El-Masri took part in a hunger strike, demanding that his captors afford him due process or watch him die. After 27 days without eating, he forced a meeting with the prison director and a CIA officer known as \\"The Boss\\". They conceded he should not be imprisoned but refused to release him. El-Masri continued his hunger strike for 10 more days until he was force-fed and given medical attention. He had lost more than 60 pounds (27 kg) since his abduction in Skopje. While imprisoned in Afghanistan, Masri befriended several other detainees. The men memorized each other's telephone numbers so that if one was released, he could contact the families of the others. According to the New York Times, Laid Saidi, an Algerian who was a former detainee, was released in 2006. His description of his abduction and detention closely matched that of El-Masri. Alt URL El-Masri reports that Majid Khan, characterized by the Bush administration as a high-value detainee, was held in the Salt Pit at the same time as he was. Khan, a former resident of Catonsville, Maryland, US was held by the CIA for an additional three and a half years prior to being transferred to US military custody and Guantanamo on 5 September 2006. Release In April 2004, CIA Director George Tenet was told by his staff that El-Masri was being wrongfully detained. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice learned of the German citizen's detention in early May and ordered his release. Shortly before El-Masri was released, in May 2004 the US ambassador to Germany informed the government for the first time of his detention. The ambassador asked the interior minister Otto Schily not to disclose the events, as the US feared \\"exposure of a covert action program designed to capture terrorism suspects abroad and transfer them among countries, and possible legal challenges to the CIA from Mr Masri and others with similar allegations.\\" El-Masri was released on 28 May 2004 following a second order from Rice. The CIA flew El-Masri out of Afghanistan and released him at night on a desolate road in Albania, without an apology or funds to return home.\\"Khaled El-Masri: Torturing the Wrong Man\\", New Yorker blog, December 2012 He later said that, at the time he believed his release was a ruse, and he would be executed. He was intercepted by Albanian guards, who believed him to be a terrorist due to his haggard and unkempt appearance. He was returned to Germany. It took time for him to be reunited with his wife; with no word of him for so long, she thought he had abandoned her and their family, and returned with their children to her family in Lebanon. In 2005, a German prosecutor started aiding El-Masri to validate his case.

Other legal troubles On May 17, 2007, El-Masri was arrested on suspicion of arson. According to Die Welt Online, the problem arose over a dispute over an iPod that El-Masri had bought at a METRO warehouse club store back in April in the Bavarian city of Neu-Ulm. He claimed the iPod malfunctioned just hours after purchase. When he tried to return it, the store refused, and the situation escalated into a shouting match. El-Masri spat in the face of a female employee, and was barred from the store. On May 17, 2007, El-Masri kicked in a door of the Metro store and used gasoline to start a fire. The fire caused almost ‚Ç¨90,000 in damages.Suspended Sentence for Khaled El Masri (German Language), S√ºdwest-Presse, 21.12.2007 Nobody was hurt. El- Masri was arrested near the scene of the crime. After arrest, a judge ordered him held in a psychiatric hospital. On May 18, El-Masri's attorney, Manfred Gnjidic, conceded his client did set fire to the store, but blamed it on his client's torture experiences and claimed that the German government did not provide enough therapy to him after his return from Afghanistan. He had actually requested extended therapy for his client shortly before the incident, as El-Masri stated he felt threatened, and believed himself to be pursued by cars and strangers. He stated the act of arson was executed on impulse and could not have led to a larger fire. While the courts recognized that El-Masri had never breached the law before his CIA abduction, and ruled that he had been traumatized, they also stated that this did not now justify acts of violence. He received a suspended sentence. Prosecutors in the arson case also revealed that El-Masri faced charges for allegedly attacking a truck driving instructor. They said El-Masri lost his temper after the instructor criticized him for failing to attend his lessons. On September 11, 2009, El- Masri was arrested after attacking Gerold Noerenberg, the mayor of Neu-Ulm. Shortly before the attack El-Masri tried to meet Noerenberg, but was prevented from entering the office and sent off by the police. He then took three of his six children with him, stormed the office and struck Noerenberg repeatedly in the face and threw a chair after him. He was arrested two hours after the attack in Senden. He confessed the attack, but kept silent about the motives at the time. Writing from his cell, he complained about the increasing licensing of brothels by the city, one of which he said desecrated a Muslim prayer room.\\"Revenge for brothels a motive for El-Masri's attack?\\" (in German) Augsburger Allgemeine, 20 October 2009 He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on 30 March 2010.

On December 13, 2012, the Grand Chamber for the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling, finding that El-Masri's account of his abduction, rendition and torture \\"was established beyond reasonable doubt\\" and that Macedonia \\"had been responsible for his torture and ill-treatment both in the country itself and after his transfer to the U.S. authorities in the context of an extra-judicial rendition.\\"Associated Press, \\"European court says CIA tortured German man: Suspect abducted, held in Afghan prison\\", CBC News, 13 December 2012 It awarded El-Masri 60,000 Euros in compensation.\\"Rendition Victim El-Masri Awarded 60,000 Euros\\", Der Spiegel, 13 December 2012 The Court termed El-Masri's abduction, detention and torture in Macedonia, and subsequent rendition to Afghanistan, a forced disappearance. The Court stated that El-Masri's allegations were supported by previous investigations into flight logs, as well as forensic evidence about his physical condition. This was the first time that a court had found in favor of El-Masri since his release by the CIA. In a statement before the Grand Chamber, the Open Society Institute, which had prosecuted the case, called upon the United States to apologize to El-Masri.

From December 2005 it was also broadcast in the East of Scotland on DAB, serving Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians. It was the last radio station to be licensed by the Radio Authority before it became part of Ofcom. The station was tailored for the over-50s and presenters included ex-Radio Clyde DJ Dave Marshall, as well as Bryce Curdy, Angus Simpson and Art Sutter. At its peak it had a reach of 229,000 in September 2006 and a market share of 7.30% in September 2005. Its first year figures were ahead of the expectations of managing director Norman Quirk. Following GMG Radio buying Saga Radio in December 2006 it was announced that Saga 105.2 FM was to be rebranded as Smooth Radio from March 2007. This was a brand name being used by GMG for its soul stations in London and the North-West of England and would also be adopted by Saga's sister stations in the Midlands. On 23 March 2007 the last voice to be heard on the station was that of Angus Simpson who thanked the listeners and played the last record \\"Bringing Back the Good Times\\" by Love Affair, the same song that launched the station two years previously. Immediately following at 6pm was the \\"Smooth Preview Weekend\\" giving listeners a taste of the music to come on the frequency. The official launch of Smooth Radio took place at 6 am on Monday 26 March 2007 with new breakfast presenter, ex-Radio Clyde DJ John McCauley.

The game's plot revolves around an interconnected cast of characters that possess a power which enables them to see and hear what a nearby character sees. It was followed by two sequel/remakes and a loose film adaption. On June 14, 2016 it was re-released for the PlayStation 4 which is part of the PS2 on PS4 library with added trophy support and at a higher resolution. Gameplay Siren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \\"Link Navigator\\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called shibito, or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage. There are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power known as \\"sightjacking\\", which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack. The game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non- player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they will eventually recover after a short period of time. Characters will also lose stamina during combat and while running, which will also naturally refill after a short amount of time. Plot The story of Siren is told through the alternating perspectives of ten survivors of a supernatural disaster in the (fictional) rural Japanese town of Hanuda (Hany≈´da in the Japanese version) in the year 2003 (Sh≈çwa year 78). These events are presented outside of chronological order and deal primarily with the efforts of the viewpoint characters to both escape the town and find answers to what has happened in the three days immediately following the disaster. Initially presented as being merely an earthquake the disaster is rapidly shown to be far more bizarre and wide ranging. The majority of the population has become infected with an unknown affliction that appears to severely damage cognitive function, causing them to bleed from the eyes, become violently hostile on sight towards anyone not also infected and seemingly immortal, able to recover and heal from even the most grievous of injuries in a short time. All natural water sources and rainfall in the town have been replaced with a strange liquid (referred to as \\"Red water\\") and the town, previously located in a mountainous region deep inland, has become an island surrounded on all sides by an ocean of the red water with no other land in sight. Furthermore, multiple sections of the town appear to have been replaced with past versions of themselves with buildings destroyed by landslides 27 years prior, although derelict as if abandoned for decades, suddenly reappearing or replacing their more modern counterparts. It is revealed over the course of the game that Hanuda, which is a strongly isolationist community due to historical religious persecution, follows a unique syncretic faith known as the \\"Mana Religion\\" that incorporates many Christian and Shinto traditions. The senior figures of this faith, in particular the nun Hisako Yao, had attempted to call forth and appease their god through ritual human sacrifice of a girl named Miyako Kajiro who they considered holy for her psychic abilities. When Kyoya Suda, an outsider to the town who had arrived to investigate online ghost stories, accidentally stumbles on the ceremony Miyako, unwilling to be killed, uses the momentary distraction he provides to flee the scene and causes the ritual to fail. It is this failure that creates the disaster, pulling the entire town into another world where space and time are severely distorted. The eponymous 'Siren' of the title, heard regularly all across the town throughout the game's events, is the god's call, compelling Hanuda's residents to infect and immerse themselves in the ocean of red water, thus creating an army of subordinates called . The shibito then go about building a nest to house the god's corporeal form once it is summoned, as well as killing and converting any remaining humans left in Hanuda. Despite Kyoya being able to slay the alien god at the end of the three days the story concludes with only one of the ten viewpoint characters, elementary school student Harumi Yomoda, escaping from Hanuda alive and returning to the real world as she is the only remaining human in the town not infected in some way by the red water. Development and release Rather than employ traditional facial animation methods with polygonal transformation, images of real human faces were captured from eight different angles and superimposed onto the character models, an effect similar to projecting film onto the blank face of a mannequin. The game was re- released for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Store. On 14 June 2016 the game received a digital release for the PlayStation 4 in NA and PAL regions as an emulated and upscaled version of the PlayStation 2 original with added Trophy support. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggegration website Metacritic. GameSpot's reviewer Bethany Massimilla concluded that although the game had a great story, and interesting characters, it was also tedious. IGN's reviewer Jeremy Dunham praised the originality of the concept, the use of Sightjacking, the graphics and the storyline, but criticized the difficulty level and the trial and error nature of the gameplay. GameSpy's Bryan Stratton followed other reviewers in praising the storyline and atmosphere, but criticizing the nature of the gameplay. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, one seven, and two eights for a total of 32 out of 40. Sequels Forbidden Siren 2 is the second installment in the series and was released in February 2006. The game tells the story of several characters who become trapped on Yamijima, an island off the coast of mainland Japan. A film based on the second game was released concurrently. Siren: Blood Curse is the third installment in the series and was released in July 2008. The game is a \\"reimagining\\" of the first game and it tells the story of an American camera crew's disappearance in a mountainous region in Japan. Manga On April 17, 2014, Sony announced a manga series titled Siren: Akai Umi no Yobigoe (Siren: The Call of the Red Sea) which was based on the first game. The manga was drawn by Wataru Kamio and ran from July 2014 to December 2015 in Home-sha's Shinmimibukuro Atmos magazine. The manga was scheduled to move to an online format in April 2016, but due to the author's health complications, the manga was put on hiatus. The game franchise's director Keiichir≈ç Toyama and scenario writer Naoko Sat≈ç were supervising all aspects of the manga. It was ultimately discontinued. In 2018, a new ongoing manga titled Siren: ReBIRTH was published to commemmorate the series' fifteenth anniversary. It is written by Saki Yoshi and overseen by the development team of the games.

The Link publishes a monthly magazine on the first Tuesday of each month during the fall and winter semesters, and publishes online daily through its website. The Link is the longest-running student publication at Concordia. From 1999 until 2017, The Link published weekly on each Tuesday. In the spring of 2017, The Link and its members voted to transition to a monthly magazine format, and the first issue was published on September 5, 2017. The Link's mandate is to publish stories not usually covered by mainstream media, and the publication specializes in advocacy journalism. Contributors cover stories about student life, as well as local, national and international issues of interest to the Concordia and Montreal communities. Its revenue comes from a student fee-levy and both print and online advertising. History The Link was founded in 1980 as a merger between The Georgian, representing Sir George Williams University, and The Loyola News, representing Loyola College, when the two schools merged to form Concordia University. The Link was called so because it was meant to link both campuses, and it produced its first by-weekly issue on August 22, 1980. The Link became financially independent from the student council in 1983. Before becoming The Link, Georgian editor David A. Bowman handed over editorial control of the newspaper to the Black Students‚Äô Association in the midst of the 1969 Computer Centre Incident. They produced an issue outlining their grievances with the administration and the content was highly libelous and inflammatory. The RCMP seized most copies of the paper, which would later become known as the Black Georgian because of its black cover. The student council later fired Bowman for ‚Äúfinancial and journalistic incompetence.‚Äù In 1985, The Link interviewed Hunter S. Thompson, who was scheduled to speak at Concordia. Twenty-eight years later its author, Dwayne Perrault, recounted how he wrote the story in an interview to The Link from his home in Amsterdam. The Link frequently prints special issues that look in-depth at a particular topic. In 1982, The Link printed its first ever queer special issue, which some students found to be controversial. 5,000 copies of the paper were removed from newsstands by students and destroyed. An issue on gender and sexuality is still printed every year. On September 14, 1999, prior to G20 summit in Montreal, the newspaper printed a cartoon field guide explaining ‚Äúhow to spot activists‚Äù on campus that went along with the message ‚ÄúEverything You Need to Know to be a Dissident in Montreal‚Äù. After massive protests greeted a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, The Link‚Äôs production came to a halt in September 2002 as the RCMP evacuated the Hall building and the talk was cancelled. As a result, The Link published its coverage of the events a day late. In 2011, The Link was the first Canadian university newspaper to become a daily online publication, with a print and online team. Since then The Link has experimented with new digital formats including special issue micro-sites for the 2012 Quebec provincial election, for a special issue on science and technology, for the 2013 Space issue, and for the 2015 International issue. In 2012, following the death of its first Editor-In-Chief, Doug Leslie, The Link created a bursary in his name to help young student journalists in financial need. The bursary consists of two $500 or one $1,000 grant for deserving staff members of The Link. In the same year, The Link left the Canadian University Press, but later rejoined in 2017 when CUP lowered its membership fees. Achievements Former photo editor Barbara Davidson and colleagues won the Pulitzer Prize for photographs taken in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In 2011, Davidson won another Pulitzer and an Emmy for her work in the LA Times about people caught in the crossfire of Los Angeles gang violence. In 2012, The Link won a John H. McDonald Award at the Canadian University Press‚Äô annual conference for photos taken from the Occupy Montreal protests in October 2011. In the same year, The Link broke a story about the substandard living conditions of international students at Concordia, which later gained national attention. The Link was nominated for eight JHM award in 2013, ultimately bringing home four awards: Riley Sparks' Taken for a Ride uncovering poor living conditions of Chinese students at Concordia University, Oliver Leon's column That Transexxual Guy, tackling the issues and everyday life of transition and trans* rights, Sam Slotnick's Tipping Point photo showing masked demonstrators attacking a bystander during the 2012 Montreal anti-police brutality march and Colin Harris' profile of Canadian band King Khan. In 2016, The Link won a JHM award for best website. The following year, four staff members won the JHM award for best cover, for their work on the ‚ÄúFirst Nations, Last Pipeline.‚Äù Former fringe editor Marie Bri√®re de la Hosseraye also won in the arts category for her piece ‚ÄúThe Final Chapter,‚Äù which told the tragic disappearance of a local bookstore owner. In 2018, The Link won two more JHM awards. Former video editor Brian Lapuz won the photo award for photos taken at a 2017 anti-police brutality march, and former managing editor Jon Milton won for best opinion writing for his article ‚ÄúAfter Quebec City, Make Racists Afraid Again,‚Äù published in February 2017.

He received his PhD from the University of Frankfurt and his Habilitation at the University of Konstanz. In Germany, he has held chairs for Political Science and Political Sociology at the Universities of Bielefeld (1975‚Äì1989) and Bremen (1989‚Äì1995), as well as at the Humboldt-University of Berlin (1995‚Äì2005). He has worked as fellow and visiting professor at the Institutes for Advanced Study in Stanford, Princeton, and the Australian National University as well as Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley and The New School University, New York. Once a student of J√ºrgen Habermas, the left-leaning German academic is counted among the second generation Frankfurt School. He currently teaches political sociology at a private university in Berlin, the Hertie School of Governance. He has made substantive contributions to understanding the relationships between democracy and capitalism. His recent work has focused on economies and states in transition to democracy. He has been married to Ulrike Poppe since 2001. Fields of research * Political sociology * Social policy * Democratic theory * Transformation studies * Dual allocation problem * Late capitalism * Basic income Basic income Claus Offe is one of the founding members of Basic Income European Network, a network that later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, and he has written several articles and books around the idea ever since the 1980s. Here are a few examples that indicates his way of thinking on the issue. = Basic income and gradualism (with \\"participation income\\" as an example) = In the article \\"A Basic Income for All\\", published as a response to a text by Philippe Van Parijs in Boston Review, Offe clarifies some of his thoughts about the universal basic income and how to get there. He starts off by saying that he agrees with Van Parijs that basic income clearly is a \\"morally attractive arrangement\\" and also think that Van Parijs provides a \\"normatively compelling argument for it in terms of real freedom and social justice\\". But then directly moves on to the question of why so many people, both elites and non- elites, seem reluctant or even against the idea of an unconditional basic income. He argues that one way of looking at this is to acknowledge that certain groups may well have legitimate or rational reasons to fear the introduction of unconditional basic income. Employers may, for example, fear that their control over the workers may be weakened. Individuals and organizations may also fear that the \\"moral underpinnings of a social order\\" will be substantially weakened, that is the idea that everyone should work, employed or self-employed, in order to have a legitimate right to a living income. There is also the fear, he notes, that the tax will be too high. Taking these fears into account Offe suggests that the basic income implementation should be \\"governed by principles of gradualism and reversibility\\". Instead of thinking about basic income implementation as \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" he thinks it is better to think conceptualize and promote the system change in the dynamic terms of less and more. One way of gradually moving towards a universal basic income, according to Offe, could be to expand the list of groups, conditions and activities that are recognized as legitimate for something like a basic income already today. In other words, try to create a system of \\"participation income\\" before the real basic income, as Tony Atkinson earlier proposed in the name of a \\"participation income\\".Offe, Claus A Basic Income for All Boston Review Career movements * 2006 ‚Äì Joint Professor of Theories of the State, Hertie School of Governance, Berlin (with Ulrich K.

Bob Donlin said this pronunciation as he welcomed people to the shows with the always-out-of-adjustment mic stand microphone, but those who were unaware often said PassEEM.

The club's importance to the 1960s Cambridge folk scene is documented extensively in Eric Von Schmidt's Baby, Let Me Follow You Down: The Illustrated Story of the Cambridge Folk Years.Von Schmidt, Eric (1994). Baby, Let Me Follow You Down: The Illustrated Story of the Cambridge Folk Years, second edition. University of Massachusetts Press (Amherst) Scott Alarik described Club 47 as being \\"the hangout of choice for the new folkies\\" during that time. Today there is a Passim School of Music program, which offers workshops and classes to teens and adults. Musicians Joan Baez described to Rolling Stone's Kurt Loder how she began performing at Club 47 in 1958 as a largely unknown Boston University student, playing on Tuesday nights as a means of providing entertainment because the jazz musicians who played there had Tuesday nights off; she would continue to perform regularly there through the early 1960s. In 1961, Bob Dylan was said to have played at the club between sets for free so that he could say he had played at Club 47.White, Timothy (2001). James Taylor: Long Ago and Far Away. Omnibus (London) Dylan: A Biography gives a detailed account of Dylan's first visit to Club 47, where he saw Carolyn Hester perform and performed between Hester's sets in the hopes of impressing club manager Paula Kelley.Spitz, Bob (1989).

Hollingshead II Art marbles are high quality collectible marbles arising out of the art glass movement. They are sometimes referred to as contemporary glass marbles to differentiate them from collectible antique marbles, and are spherical works of art glass. Glass artists interest in marbles at the end of the twentieth century brought about a resurgence in hand made marbles.Sullivan, Ken (2006). The West Virginia encyclopedia, p.447. West Virginia Humanities Council. Types Dichroic glass is a very popular choice with glass artists today, especially so when creating marbles, because of its properties of having more than one color and when viewed from different angles, has a sparkle effect, much like a cut gemstone. Dichroic glass is actually a product created by the space industry, and was first used as an interference filter for precise scientific measuring. To create this effect, glass artists use a thin layer of metallic oxides including magnesium, silicon and titanium at high temperatures. This style of marble was invented by Geoffrey Beetem circa 1989 and are called Stardust Marbles. First publication was by Marilyn Barrett in 1994, Dr. Morito 1996, Glass magazine in 2000, and in Marbles and Related Art Glass, by Mark P. Block also in 2000. Vortex marbles are a very popular style created by forming a cone at the end of a rod of clear glass, typically borosilicate or scientific glass. Various patterns are created on the outside of this cone, a spiral being the most popular. This is encased to create a hemisphere. More patterns are usually added to the outside. The opposite side is turned into a lens and the entire piece is shaped into a sphere. This style was created by Kevin O'Grady circa 1994. O'Grady is a pioneer in the contemporary glass marble movement. Artists Contemporary marble artists include Josh Simpson.

He is a young mutant who first appeared in X-Men Unlimited #8. The character has appeared in several X-Men animated series and was portrayed by Dominic Monaghan in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Fictional character biography =Legacy Virus= Chris Bradley was first introduced as a young boy who began suffering from increasingly painful headaches. The headaches resulted from his electrical mutant powers, which manifested and grew out of control in the middle of a class at school, leaving him unconscious. He was rescued by Jean Grey and Gambit, who had been sent by Professor Xavier to keep an eye on him and approach him should his powers reveal themselves. After taking him home, the X-Men offered him training at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. At first Chris was reluctant, but after being shunned by his best friend, agreed to join the school. Chris spent several weeks at the school, quickly developing close friendships with the X-Men, particularly Iceman, whose own youthful personality seemed to connect well with Chris'. However, when the Beast ran a medical test on Chris, it was revealed that he was infected with the Legacy Virus, which would eventually kill him. Chris was afraid of what his future would hold, but Iceman and the other X-Men offered him aid should he ever need it. During the \\"X-Men: Zero Tolerance\\" storyline, in which the mutant hating Bastion began to target the X-Men, they lost touch with Chris. This left Bradley hurt with feelings of abandonment, particularly as his illness was growing steadily worse. =New Warriors/Bolt= He soon found a mentor in Maverick who was also suffering from the Legacy Virus.Maverick #1 (September 1997) Chris stayed with him for a while before joining the New Warriors.New Warriors Vol. 2 #1 After the break-up of his New Warriors team, he teamed up again with Maverick. =Maverick= When Maverick disappeared and was believed dead, Bolt took the Maverick alias for himself and joined the Underground, a group founded by Cable to battle Weapon X and expose its existence. Following the group's defeat, Chris remained in the Underground, though it was taken over by Marrow and remade into a new incarnation of the extremist mutant supremacist group Gene Nation. Chris did not leave as he wanted to undermine Gene Nation from within and prevent its terrorist attacks, though he was ultimately killed by his former mentor himself, now bearing the codename \\"Agent Zero\\", who did not find out Chris had been the new Maverick until it was too late. Disgusted by Agent Zero and not wanting to know his true identity, Chris died in his arms, stating that he took on Maverick's persona in order to ensure that his mentor's name would live on and that he wanted his mentor to be proud of him.Weapon X (2nd series) #20-21 =Necrosha= Chris is later resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene's army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.X-Force (3rd Series) #22, February 2010 Powers and abilities Chris could absorb ambient charges of static electricity from the atmosphere and was also able to absorb electricity from electricity-generating sources to empower himself. Typically, Chris‚Äô body harmlessly expended this energy; however, he was able to store and release it for a variety of effects, an ability he primarily manifested as devastating, electrical blasts which he fired from his hands, but he could surround himself with an energy shield that shocks anyone who touches it, conduct electricity through metal objects, or short circuit electronic devices as well. When he was fully powered up, his body was surrounded by a blazing aura that obscured his features, giving him the appearance of a being composed of electricity, which manifested as blue flames. When he originally manifested his powers, he surrounded his entire high school in a massive electrical field, but has not shown that level of power since, being cured of the Legacy Virus (which boosts mutant-power levels while it kills them). In other media =Film= * Dominic Monaghan plays Chris Bradley in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Bradley is not mentored by David North, but is his teammate (Agent Zero). Bradley is a part of Team X, alongside Logan, Victor Creed, Agent Zero, Fred Dukes, John Wraith and Wade Wilson, and is led by Major William Stryker. He has the ability to remotely control and power anything electric and in that capacity pilots the airplane that transports him and his teammates. He also has the ability to send and receive radio transmissions telepathically. Six years after the events in Africa, Bradley works in a circus in Springfield, Ohio. He is visited by Victor Creed, who kills him in his trailer causing all electronic hardware to shut down in the surrounding area. Bradley's electrical capabilities are later used for the mutant killer Weapon XI / Deadpool, specifically so that Stryker can completely control Deadpool from a computer. Bradley speaks with Monaghan's own English accent, which differs from the comics origin of the character as an American from Dutchess County, New York. * In the 2017 film Logan, a child named Bobby (portrayed by Bryant Tardy) is created by Transigen and has the powers of Chris Bradley because he is based on Bradley's genetic code.

His work focused on the difficult lives of the Russian peasant class. He was frequently reprimanded for deviations from Soviet policy on writing. Biography Abramov was from a peasant background. He studied at Leningrad State University, but put his schooling on hold to serve as a soldier in World War II. In 1951 he finished his schooling at the university, then remained as a teacher until 1960. After he left the university he became a full-time writer. His essay, written in 1954, \\"People in the Kolkhoz Village in Postwar Prose\\", which addressed the glorified portrayal of life in Communist Soviet Villages, was denounced by the Writers' Union and the Central Committee. In a later essay, Abramov argued for the repeal of the law that denied peasants internal passports; he also recommended giving the peasantry larger shares of the profits of their labors. This essay led to his removal from the editorial staff of the journal Neva. His first novel entitled, \\"Bratya i syostri\\" (\\"Brothers and Sisters\\") was written in 1958. It dealt with the harsh life of northern Russian villagers during World War II. Abramov wrote two sequels to \\"Bratya i syostri\\", entitled, \\"Dve zimy i tri leta\\" (\\"Two Winters and Three Summers\\"), written in 1968, and \\"Puti- pereputya\\" (‚ÄúPaths and Crossroads‚Äù), written in 1973.

The modern- day system mostly uses two, three, and four aspect colour-light signals using track circuit block signalling. It is a development of the original absolute block signalling that is still being used on many secondary lines. The use of lineside signals in Britain is restricted to railways with a maximum speed limit of up to . This is the maximum speed at which the train can travel safely using line-side signalling; if the train runs any faster, it will not be possible for the train driver to safely read colour-light signalling. Trains operating at speeds faster than 125 mph (for example on High Speed 1) use an in-cab signalling system that automatically determines and calculates speed restrictions.  Early days  A British semaphore signal In the days of the first British railways, \\"policemen\\" were employed by every railway company. Their jobs were many and varied, but one of their key roles was the giving of hand signals to inform engine drivers as to the state of the line ahead. They had no means of communication with their colleagues along the line, and trains were only protected by a time interval; after a train had passed him, a policeman would stop any following train if it arrived within (say) 5 minutes; for any between 5 and 10 minutes after, he would show a caution signal, and after 10 minutes, the line was assumed to be clear. Therefore, if a train failed midsection (as was very common in the early days), the policeman controlling entry to the section would not know, and could easily give a 'clear' signal to a following train when the section was not in fact clear. The number of collisions which resulted from this led to the gradual introduction of the absolute block principle; all systems of working other than this (including time-interval and permissive block) were outlawed on passenger lines in 1889, and all passenger lines were suitably equipped by 1895. As train speeds increased, it became increasingly difficult for enginemen to see hand signals given by the policemen, so the railways provided various types of fixed signals to do the job, operated by the policemen, or signalmen as they soon became known (it is due to this that British railway slang still names signalmen as \\"Bobbies\\"). Many types were devised, but the most successful was the semaphore, introduced in 1841 and soon becoming widespread, although some other types did linger on until the 1890s.  Running signals  The terms \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" are used in describing British railway signals. When describing an older semaphore, \\"on\\" refers to a signal arm in the horizontal position, and \\"off\\" means a signal raised upwards or lowered downwards from pivot point (at up to 60¬∞). With regard to newer colour-light signals, \\"on\\" is synonymous with a danger signal, while all other aspects are considered to be \\"off\\". A way to remember this is to refer to the state of the red light. If it is lit, the signal is \\"on\\", and if the red light is unlit, the signal is \\"off\\". = Semaphore signals = Image:Signal Home Semaphore R & G.svgSemaphore stop signal (lower quadrant type) Image:Signal Distant Semaphore Y & G.svgSemaphore distant signal (lower quadrant type) Image:British home and distant railway semaphore RYG signals.svgCombined semaphore stop and distant signals (lower quadrant type) The traditional British signal is the semaphore, comprising a mechanical arm that rises or drops to indicate 'clear' (termed an \\"upper-quadrant\\" or \\"lower-quadrant\\" signal, respectively). Both types are fail-safe in the event of breakage of the operating pull-wire but lower-quadrant signals require a heavy counterweight with push-pull rod between counterweight and arm linkage (generally assisted by the \\"spectacle\\" that carries the coloured lenses for use at night) to do that, while upper-quadrant signals fall back to \\"danger\\" under the weight of the arm. During the 1870s, almost all the British railway companies standardised on the use of semaphore signals, which were then invariably of the lower quadrant type.Vanns, M.A., (1997), An Illustrated History of Signalling, Ian Allan, , p.25 From the 1920s onwards, upper quadrant semaphores almost totally supplanted lower quadrant signals in Great Britain, except on former GWR lines and their succession to BR(WR) and latterly Network Rail Western Zone.Vanns, M.A., (1995), Signalling in the Age of Steam, Ian Allan, , p.80 There are two main types of semaphore; stop and distant. The stop signal consists of a red, square-ended arm, with a vertical white stripe typically 9-12 inches (230‚Äì300 mm) from the end, and advises the driver whether the line immediately ahead is clear or not. A stop signal must not be passed in the horizontal \\"on\\" (danger) position, except where specially authorised by the signalman's instruction. By night, it shows a red light when \\"on\\" and a green light when \\"off\\" (clear). The green light is usually produced through the use of a blue spectacle lens, which produces green when lit from behind by the yellowish flame from a paraffin lamp. The other type is the distant signal, which has a yellow arm with a 'V' (\\"fishtail\\") notch cut out of the end and a black chevron typically 9-12 inches (230‚Äì300 mm) from the end. Its purpose is to advise the driver of the state of the following stop signal(s); it may be passed in the \\"on\\" position, but the driver must slow his train to be able to stop at the next stop signal. When \\"off\\", a distant signal tells the driver that all the following stop signals of the signal box are also \\"off\\", and when \\"on\\" tells the driver that one or more of these signals is likely to be at danger. By night, it shows a yellow light when \\"on\\" and a green light when \\"off\\". On many branch lines and short block sections, a distant signal was often fixed at 'Caution', standalone or mounted below a Stop semaphore, and so exhibited only a yellow light at night. Where a signal consists of a combination of a stop and distant arms a mechanism is included to prevent the distant arm clearing while the stop arm is at ‚Äòdanger‚Äô. Current British practice mandates that semaphore signals, both upper and lower quadrant types, are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal to display an \\"off\\" indication. = Colour light signals = Clearing sequence from red to green of a 4 aspect colour light signal In total, colour-light signals in the UK display seven aspects. These are: * Green ‚Äì Clear. The train may proceed subject to any speed restrictions applying to the section of line or to the train itself. (See also Flashing Green below.) * Double yellow ‚Äì Preliminary caution. The next signal is displaying a single yellow aspect. * Flashing double yellow - indicates that the next signal is showing flashing yellow. * Single yellow ‚Äì Caution. The driver must prepare to stop the train at the next signal. * Flashing yellow - warns that a lower-speed diverging route is set, at a high speed turnout. * Red ‚Äì Danger/Stop. Additionally, on the trial section of line between Peterborough and York: * Flashing Green - the train may proceed at line speed. Where this aspect is in use, the steady green aspect means that the next signal shows double yellow. The green aspect and the four yellow aspects are known as 'proceed aspects', as they allow the train to pass the signal; the red aspect requires the train to stop. Two- aspect systems use red and green only. Three-aspect systems include yellow. Four-aspect signalling, which also includes double yellow, is mostly used on busy routes to allow shorter headways, and on fast routes to provide longer braking distances.  Flashing yellow aspects  Diverging route signalling - the driver must slow down and be prepared to stop at the red signal. A flashing single or double yellow aspect indicates that a train is to take a diverging route ahead with a lower line speed than the main route. A flashing double yellow (only used in 4-aspect signalling) means that the next signal is showing flashing single yellow. A flashing single yellow means that the next signal at the junction is showing (steady) single yellow with an indication for a diverging route, and the signal beyond the junction is at danger (red). This sequence of increasingly restrictive aspects forces the driver to slow the train down in preparation for stopping at the red signal, and this ensures that the train crosses the junction safely. As the train nears the junction, the red signal beyond may 'step up' to a less restrictive aspect depending on the state of the line ahead. The two yellows in a flashing double-yellow flash in unison rather than alternately, but the flashing double-yellow and single-yellows are not synchronised. Flashing yellow signalling contains an additional safety vital relay referred to as \\"FECR\\" ‚Äì this changes over the supply for the yellow signal transformers at each signal where flashing aspects are provided from a steady 110Va.c. (BX110) to a \\"flashing\\" FBX110 supply switched on and off at about 1.2Hz or 70‚Äì72 c.p.m., once the junction points have been set, locked and detected correctly for the lower‚Äìspeed divergence. This supply has to be specially provided, either from the power‚Äìbox or control centre, or by a specially designed signal control module in more modern LED installations, which is why B.R. originally had much more stringent criteria for the use of flashing aspects than is nowadays the case. =Failures= A failure of the changeover relay to switch on the flashing indication to the double-yellow aspect would not be a problem as it is considered a steady double-yellow followed by a flashing single-yellow aspect sequence is acceptable. However, safety circuitry is connected to the single-yellow flashing supply to ensure that a failure of the single-yellow to change over to the flashing supply would abort the \\"approach release from yellow\\" sequence and re-impose the normal \\"approach control from red\\" sequence as failure of the single yellow to flash following a flashing double-yellow is considered potentially very dangerous.  Lens placement and alignment  Use of LEDs means that four / seven aspects can now be achieved with just two luminaires The design considerations determining the familiar arrangement of road signals, with red at the top, do not apply to the railway. There is only one train at any one signal, and so no need for the signal to be visible to multiple drivers along a queue of traffic; and the driver required to stop at a red aspect will normally have had clear advance warning, from the yellow aspect at the previous signal, so there is little need for the red aspect to be visible at maximum distance. Instead, on pole- and gantry-mounted railway signals the red aspect is usually positioned at the bottom. This places it closest to the driver's eyeline; it also means the red aspect cannot become obscured by snow building up on the lens hood of an aspect placed below. For corresponding reasons, on ground-mounted signals red is positioned as the highest of the principal aspects (though for example junction indicators may appear above it): again, closest to the driver's eyeline; and the risk of snow build-up on the ground obscuring the red is minimised. On two-aspect signals the two are placed next to each other, as they are distinguished by colour rather than position. On three-aspect signals, the yellow appears between red and green, matching the natural sequence of clear - caution - stop. On four- aspect signals the two yellow aspects are separated by the green, for clarity in distinguishing the YY aspect from Y. Variations are found according to features of track layout (junctions, crossovers, stations, bay platforms, etc.) and at interfaces between areas of, for example, three- and four-aspect systems. In the past use was made of searchlight signals. These have a single lamp in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green filter to show the respective aspect. The filter assembly is moved by an electro-magnet. For a double-yellow aspect a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only when required. A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving filter glasses inside) remain in use in the Clacton area. The concept had a renaissance in the 2000s with the advent of LEDs which can show three different colours. Signal alignment is generally aimed towards a distance 200 yards (183 metres) in rear of the signal (that is, in the direction behind the driver observing it) and at a height of 2.5 to 3 m above the left hand rail. Ground mounted signals are rarely so critical for alignment (an advantage of ground mounting) and are often used in tunnels, where the relative luminosity of the aspects is much higher.  Unusual colour light aspects  Double green aspect on the London Underground. * Flashing green ‚Äì flashing green aspects are employed on the East Coast Main Line north of Peterborough. They were installed for 140 mph (225 km/h) running in connection with the testing of the new InterCity 225 electric trains, with a steady green limiting test trains to the normal speed limit of 125 mph (200 km/h). They no longer have official meaning, but remain in place and there are a couple of locations where the presence or absence of flashing provides useful information to drivers. * Splitting distants ‚Äì at some locations approaching a junction two heads are placed side by side. When this signal or the junction signal is at danger, one head is dark and the other shows red or single yellow. When the junction signal is not at danger, both heads show an aspect: the one for the route set ahead of the junction (left or right) shows the correct aspect while the other shows single yellow (or double yellow at an \\"outer splitting distant\\"). * Green over yellow, or green over green ‚Äì the Liverpool Loop Line and London Underground use separate red/green \\"stop\\" and yellow/green \\"repeater\\" signals. If a repeater signal is at the same location as a stop signal, it is placed underneath it and lit only when the stop signal is green. Thus the order of the heads is (from top to bottom) green, red, green, yellow, and aspects are red, green over yellow, and green over green. * Yellow over green ‚Äì this was used in the experimental \\"speed signalling\\" at Mirfield to provide an additional caution. It meant that the next signal was showing double yellow. It was discontinued in 1970.  Approach control  At certain locations such as the final signal on approach to a terminus station or at a diverging route requiring a large speed reduction, approach release may be used. The driver will be \\"checked down\\" with a normal signalling sequence (green, double yellow, yellow for a four-aspect area) and the red signal clears when the train is close to it. Typically for low speed junctions (e.g. crossover on a line), the train will be brought down to nearly standing at the signal before it clears. The control of this can be achieved by a time- delay that commences on the approaching track circuit becoming occupied. After the elapsed time, the signal is allowed to \\"step-up\\" to the highest available aspect and display the junction indicator where applicable. Where a junction indicator is used an additional safety precaution ensures that failure of the indicator does not cause an irregular or mutilated display to appear due to partial failures of individual elements. This can be observed in practice ‚Äì at Bescot Stadium northbound the signal, when cleared for the divergence for Walsall-bound trains, shows the junction-indicator with a red aspect for 2-3 seconds before the main aspect clears ‚Äì this is whilst the interlocking proves sufficient elements of the junction-indicator is lit before clearing the main aspect. With conventional interlocking the red aspect only remains alight for a fraction of a second while the junction-indicator is proved locally. With a solid state or computerised signalling this proof has to pass through the interlocking, hence the additional time requirement.  Delayed Yellow Operation  In the Absolute Block Signalling System, the signalling regulations provide for trains to be signalled into a section of line where the designated \\"overlap\\" past the signal is not clear ‚Äì the signaller keeps the signal concerned at danger until the train has come to a stand at it, and then the driver must be warned verbally by the signaller that the line is not clear the whole distance to the next signal, then once the signaller is satisfied the driver has understood the warning, he will typically pull off the signal very slowly ‚Äì the driver understands from this that she is being accepted into the occupied length of line under \\"Warning\\" Regulation 4. In colour light power box operated areas, the \\"home\\" signal where \\"warning\\" arrangements are in force has a time release similar to approach control from red but the control is more stringent ‚Äì the signal only clears when the speed of the train is detected to be less than 10 mph and only clearance to single yellow is allowed ‚Äì this is called delayed yellow operation, and is often found at the approach to large stations where two trains may use one platform.  Subsidiary signals  Subsidiary signals are those which usually control only shunting moves, as opposed to train movements. Under this category come permissive signals and shunting signals. = Semaphore subsidiary signals =  Permissive signals  A British lower-quadrant semaphore stop signal with subsidiary arm belowAlthough British railway operation is based on the block principle whereby only one train is allowed in a signal section, there are situations when another train must enter the section, and permissive signals are used to control that movement. There are three types of permissive semaphore: calling-on, shunt-ahead, and warning signals. Today, all three look broadly the same; they are shaped like a normal stop signal, though only about two-thirds of the size, and are painted red with a white horizontal band running centrally along them. When \\"on\\", they show a small red or white light, and when \\"off\\", they display a small green light and an illuminated 'C', 'S' or 'W', depending on their function. Modern-day permissive signals consist of two white lights at 45¬∞, normally unlit. When lit, with the main aspect showing red, they instruct the driver to proceed but be prepared to stop short of any obstruction. When unlit, the driver obeys the main signal aspect. They can therefore function either as calling-on or shunt-ahead signals, depending on their location (the Warning Arrangement in colour-light areas, uses the main aspect in a similar fashion to approach release junction signalling, in this case it is called a Delayed Yellow ). ;Calling-on signal The calling-on signal is by far the most common of the three types of subsidiary signal. It is mounted under the stop signal governing entry to (usually) a platform and, when pulled off, allows the driver to proceed cautiously for as far as the line is clear (or to the next stop signal). This can allow three basic moves to take place; # A second train to run into and exchange passengers at an already partly occupied platform; # Additional vehicles to be attached to the rear of a standing train; # A locomotive to run into a platform occupied by coaches to be attached to them. ;Shunt-ahead signal The shunt-ahead signal is normally mounted under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, and, as its name implies, allows a train to enter the section and clear a set of points in order to carry out a shunting move. ;Warning signal The warning signal is the most unusual of the three types of British permissive signal. It is, like the shunt-ahead, placed under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different. For a signalman to accept a train, both his block section and the line for a quarter mile inside his outer home signal must usually be clear; the quarter mile is a precaution in case the driver fails to stop in time for the outer home signal. However, it is possible to accept a train under the \\"Warning Arrangement\\" if the block section, but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding in the middle of that section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead. = Position light signals = Image:UK Railway Signal - 4 Aspect - Associated Signal.svgAssociated position light Image:UK Ground Position Light Signal - Shunt Signal - Aspect Chart.svgGround position light - Ground Position Light Image:UK Ground Position Light Signal - Shunt Ahead - Aspect Chart.svgYellow position light - Shunt Ahead Image:UK Ground Position Light Signal - Limit of Shunt.svgLimit of Shunt Position light signals allow a train to move into a section under caution, the line ahead may be occupied so the driver must drive at a speed that enables him/her to stop short of any obstruction. Modern position lights consist of three lenses in a triangular formation. Associated position light signals (APLS) are attached to a main aspect signal and are only illuminated when a shunting movement is permitted. When the main signal aspect is red, the position light displays two white lights at an angle of 45¬∞ indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution. When not cleared these signals are unlit, and the train driver obeys the main aspect signal. Ground position light signals (GPLS), are always illuminated and are located either near the ground or on a post with no corresponding main signal. They can display the following aspects: * Either two red lights or one white light and one red light in a horizontal arrangement, meaning 'Stop'. * Two white lights at a 45¬∞ angle, meaning 'Proceed'. The driver may pass this signal with caution and a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. Shunt ahead signals are fitted with either two yellow lights, or one white and one yellow light. They are usually found at the exits of marshaling yards and sidings, and can be passed at danger for a movement in the direction for which the signal cannot be cleared (e.g. into a headshunt rather than onto the main line). This arrangement prevents the signal from being cleared every time a shunt takes place within the sidings which doesn't need to enter the running line. When cleared they allow access to the main line. Limit of Shunt A limit of shunt signal. consists of two permanently lit red lights in a horizontal arrangement, meaning 'Stop'. No train is allowed to pass this signal as the direction will be against the normal direction of travel. A limit of shunt signal is permanently lit and cannot display any other aspect; there is no lens fitted in the proceed position on these signals.  Semaphore and Disc Shunting Signals  Disc shunting signalThe mechanical equivalents of these shunting signals are found as miniature semaphores (the arms are the same size as those of permissive signals) and disc varieties (the disc is about 12 inches/30 cm diameter). The small-arm semaphores are painted in the same way as a full-size stop signal, while the discs are painted white with a red horizontal band. A small-arm semaphore shows \\"clear\\" in the same way as a full-size stop signal, while a disc rotates through 45 degrees or so when pulled off so that the red band is angled. Both display small red or green lights by night. There are also semaphore and disc equivalents of the yellow light shunting signals; the small-arm semaphores being painted yellow with a black stripe and the discs either black or white with a yellow stripe; by night, they show small yellow lights when \\"on\\" and small green lights when \\"off\\". Finally, instead of fixed position light signals, the Limit of Shunt may also be signalled by a simple white floodlit board on which the words \\"Limit of Shunt\\" are written in red.  Junction signals  British railway signalling is unusual in that it uses route signalling rather than that speed signalling. A driver is informed of which route he will take at a junction, rather than the speed at which he should travel through it. = Semaphore junction signals = Splitting signalsIn semaphore areas, junctions are signalled using a series of between 2 and 5 stop signal arms on one bracket or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post (\\"doll\\") on the bracket, and each arm applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the posts usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, although there is no definite standard. In some cases, the tallest post applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided ‚Äì a series of side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which post on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast. Where there is a large number of possible routes, splitting signals are unsuitable because they could easily be confused, and route indicators are used instead. These consist of a black background, mounted under a single stop signal, on which is superimposed a white letter(s), number(s) or combination of the two, to make a code indicating the route to be taken. For example, if the possible routes were to Cambridge and to Norwich, a Norwich-bound train might be shown 'N' and a Cambridge-bound train 'C'. The route code is only shown when the signal is off. In semaphore areas, route indicators may be mechanical, with boards that slide into view to display the code; or electric \\"theatre-type\\", with a light projected through a suitably-printed screen. = Colour-light junction signals = Image:UK Railway Signal - 4 Aspect - Proceed - Diverging Route Position 4.svgJunction indicator - right route Image:UK Railway Signal - 4 Aspect - Proceed - Diverging Route Position 1.svgJunction indicator - First left route Image:theatre-boxes.jpgAlphanumeric route indicator. The colour-light equivalent of a splitting signal is the junction indicator, colloquially known as a \\"lunar indicator\\", \\"feather\\", or \\"horn\\" in Scotland. Mounted above a colour-light signal, they consist of a row of white lights (originally a single, long, u-shaped fluorescent tube in an open-fronted case), nowadays five but traditionally three, angled to the left or right depending on the direction of the divergence. When the highest-speed route is set, the indicator is not illuminated (unless all routes are of a similar speed, in which case there is an indication for each route). When a diverging route is set, the respective junction indicator is illuminated. These can be used where there is a maximum of six routes as well as the 'straight' route, and where a maximum of three routes are to one side of the 'straight' route. Two junction indicators in opposite directions on the same signal are colloquially known as \\"bunny ears\\". Where junction indicators cannot be used, route indicators are also used in colour-light areas. They may take the form of a dot-matrix of white lamps, or, in more recent installations, fibre-optic displays driven from a single lamp to display the route code. At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore route indicators, they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations. In areas where speeds are lower and there are a number of routes which can be taken, alphanumeric (also called theatre-style) route indicators are used to display a number or a letter (e.g. a platform number or line designation) to denote the route the train is to take. They may be located above or beside the relevant signal. When a route is set and the signal is cleared, the relevant letter or number is shown. On shunting signals, where speeds are much lower, a miniature version of the alphanumeric route indicator is used. When a route is set at a junction that involves the train taking a diverging route that must be passed at less than the mainline speed, a system known as approach release is used. There are a number of different types of approach release that are used on British railways but the most often used is approach release from red. This system has the signal before the diverging junction held at red until the train approaches it, whereupon it changes to a less restrictive aspect with the appropriate direction feather of five white lights. This is required so that the signals approaching show the correct caution aspects, slowing the train down for the junction. While the junction signal is held at red, the preceding signal will be displaying caution (yellow), and the one before that will display preliminary caution (double yellow) if it is a 4-aspect signal. This system allows for a gradual decrease in speed until a safe speed is reached for the train to move through the junction. Another common system is approach release from yellow with flashing aspects in rear. It is essentially similar to approach release from red, except that the junction signal is released from yellow and the signals in rear will flash to warn the driver that the train will be taking a diverging route ahead. Where the turnout speed is the same as the mainline speed, approach release is not necessary. Speed indicators Speed indicators are displayed along a route to ensure a train does not go faster than the maximum permitted speed. =Permissible speed indicators= In the UK, every section of railway line has a maximum speed, known as the Permissible speed. Table A of the Network Rail Sectional Appendix provides a list of these. Where there is a change in permissible speed on a line, a permissible speed indicator sign will show the new speed. Train crew are expected to know every permissible speed for all the routes they work over as part of their Route knowledge. When the speed limit increases, the rear end of the train passing must completely clear the speed limit sign before the speed limit can take effect. This minimises the risk of derailment. Permissible Speed Indicator ;Permissible speed indicator Permissible speed indicator. This example is displaying a maximum permissible speed of . Differential permissible speed indicator ;Differential permissible speed indicator The number below the line always shows a higher speed and applies to passenger trains, parcel and postal trains and light locomotives, while the top number applies to all other trains. This example therefore is displaying a maximum permissible speed of for passenger trains, parcel and postal trains and light locomotives, in addition to a maximum permissible speed of for all other trains. Diverging permissible speed indicator ;Diverging permissible speed indicator This example is displaying a maximum permissible speed of only for the diverging route to the left. Unless otherwise indicated with another sign, this does not apply to the current route. 75 mph warning indicator ;Warning indicator Warning indicators are provided whenever there is a reduction in permissible speed of a third or more, and are placed at the service braking distance from the start of the lower speed. They are colloquially known as 'Morpeth boards', after the 1969 derailment at Morpeth, Northumberland that led to their introduction. Often, but not always, there is an AWS magnet placed before the indicator to give an audible warning to the train driver. 75 mph diverging warning indicator ;Diverging warning indicator These indicators warn the driver of a lower speed limit on a route diverging ahead. This example is displaying a maximum permissible speed of on the left diverging route. These warnings are provided whenever there is a reduction of permissible speed of a third or more, and, again, are placed at the service braking distance from the start of the lower speed. Speed restrictions =Temporary speed restriction= When it is necessary to carry out planned maintenance or repair work on a line, a temporary speed restriction (TSR) may be installed at a particular location. Train crew are notified of this in the Network Rail issued Weekly Operating Notice, which they are required to read before they book on duty. TSR warning board At the service braking distance before the speed restriction, a temporary AWS magnet is installed between the running rails, followed by a yellow speed warning board. TSR speed indicator and termination boardAt the commencement of the speed restriction there is a yellow speed board, and at the end is a yellow termination board. The train cannot accelerate to the maximum permissible speed of the line until the last vehicle has passed the 'T' indicator. Repeater warning board and SPATE indicatorWhen there is a station between the warning board and the commencement board, a yellow repeater warning board showing an R is positioned beyond the end of platforms to remind drivers of the restriction ahead. If the advertised TSR is not installed, or is withdrawn earlier than planned, a yellow SPATE ('Speed previously advertised terminated early') board will be set up. =Emergency speed restriction= ESR warning indicator If a speed restriction needs to be imposed before there is time to publish it in the Weekly Operating Notice, an Emergency speed restriction (ESR) is set up. This consists of a temporary AWS magnet and flashing warning indicator (also known colloquially as a 'Dalek' or 'Metal Mickey') placed before the usual temporary speed restriction equipment. Network Rail will fax information about the ESR to train crew booking-on points, where it must be displayed in the red- coloured 'Late notice case'. Crews are required to check this case when signing on for duty. If the speed restriction remains in place long enough for it to be published in the Weekly operating notice, it will become a Temporary speed restriction so the Warning indicator and its associated AWS magnet will be removed. =Blanket speed restriction= A Blanket speed restriction is used when it is necessary for trains to run more slowly over a large area. This is commonly used for weather conditions such as high winds, high temperatures or snow. No trackside signs are put out for a Blanket speed restriction, which enables it to be imposed quickly. Initially train drivers are informed directly by the signaller, and information is faxed to drivers' booking on points where it is posted on the Late notice board.  Other signals  Preliminary Routing Indicators (PRIs) are installed on the approach to certain junctions. When the junction signal is displaying a 'proceed' aspect, the PRI will display an arrow. The arrow points up when the highest speed route is set. When a diverging route is set, the arrow points in the appropriate direction (mimicking the junction indicator on the junction signal). This advance indication gives the driver an opportunity to stop before the junction points, if wrongly routed. At the present time, PRIs are few in number, but they are likely to become more common. Proceed on Sight Authority is a new concept which introduces an additional aspect to allow the signalman to authorise drivers to pass signals when they are at red due to influences within the interlocking. The signal will notionally be used where the route setting and locking function is still proved to be operable but a function such as train detection or lamp proving of a signal ahead may be failed. The authority will allow the driver to pass the signal and proceed at a speed slow enough that they may stop short of any obstruction (in common with other degraded modes of operation) The term may be abbreviated to \\"PoSA\\". A \\"Proceed On Sight Authority\\" is only shown in conjunction with a red main aspect on a main signal and when operated the two white lights in the subsidiary signal flash on and off together to warn the driver he is proceeding under caution only as far as the line can be seen to be clear.Railway Group Standard GE/RT8071 Off indicator Off Indicator: An illuminated off indication means the associated signal is showing a proceed aspect. These are mainly used at stations, for the benefit of the train-crew and platform staff. When the display is blank, it means that the associated signal is at danger. An illuminated indication CD (close doors) is an instruction to close the train's power-operated doors. An illuminated indication RA or R (right away) means that station duties are complete and the train may depart. SPAD indicator protecting the entrance to a single line A SPAD indicatorOnline Rulebook: Module S1 / Section 4.5 ‚Äì SPAD Indicator is a separate indicator which may be positioned after a main signal where there is a likelihood of a serious collision at a junction if a SPAD (signal passed at danger) occurs at the main signal. SPAD indicators are mounted against a blue backplate or surround. They are normally unlit but following a SPAD they display a steady red light between two flashing red lights arranged vertically. Any driver who sees a SPAD indicator illuminated must stop their train immediately, even if they can see that the signal pertaining to their line is showing a proceed aspect. =Banner repeating signals= Image:repeater-on.jpgBanner on Image:repeater-off.jpgBanner off Image:repeater-green.jpgBanner green Banner repeater signals are provided on the approach to certain signals which have restricted sighting (for example because of curvature of the line, buildings, overbridges or tunnels), to give advance information of the signal aspect. Their meanings are *Banner on: The signal to which it applies is at danger. *Banner off: The signal to which it applies is showing a proceed aspect. *Green banner: The signal to which it applies is showing a green aspect. If two or more banner repeaters are placed together, this allows for the repetition of routing indications. Only one banner repeater in such a set will display an off indication for the appropriate route, while a danger signal is repeated by setting all repeaters in such a set to on.http://www.railsigns.uk/sect7page3/sect7page3.html  Obsolete signals  = Purple lights = in particular circumstances (e.g. wrong-road or goods lines).S&DJR; wrong-road signals = Three-position semaphore signals = From 1914, a small number of British installations used motor-operated three-position semaphore signals of North American origin. These worked in the upper quadrant to distinguish them from the two-position lower quadrant semaphores that were standard at the time of their introduction. When the arm was inclined upwards at 45¬∞, the meaning was \\"caution\\" and the arm in the vertical position meant \\"clear\\". Thus, three indications could be conveyed with just one arm and without the need for a distant arm on the same post. = Euston to Watford experimental system = LMS signal at Willesden Junction. The green signal is for the line towards Euston / Elephant & Castle / Broad Street via Primrose Hill. The route to the left with the red signal leads to the North London Line and was used by trains to Broad Street via Hampstead Heath. This scheme, on the face of it, was a fairly standard colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green ‚Äì the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two. When a train stopped at a red stop signal, its presence on the track started a time delay relay. At the conclusion of the time delay, the red marker light was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The train stop also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train. The scheme was not considered a great success. In fact, during periods of severe service disruption, it was not unusual to see several trains buffer-to-buffer along the line, though this occurred when the line was much busier than now. Concern was expressed that similar coloured aspects had different interpretations depending on where on the signal they appeared. The system was finally identified for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train ran into the back of Bakerloo Line train. The driver had apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were that the driver was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage ‚Äì but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested that the driver may not even have checked the indications having observed the fall of the train stop. The entire line was resignalled to the standard colour light system in 1988.  Warning systems  Because of the propensity for heavy fog in some parts of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators ‚Äì small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal was displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal was clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed. Britain's Great Western Railway introduced the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This system is the forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup on the underside of the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it. The current system of AWS in use on Britain's railways is similar in principle to the Great Western's ATC but does not rely on physical contact between the track equipment and the train; instead an inductive system is used. On passenger lines, AWS is now often supplemented by the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS). TPWS will automatically apply the train's brakes in the event of a fitted signal being passed at danger without authority.

He has been a member of the Avengers and the New Warriors, and appeared in the pages of The Avengers, New Warriors, Night Thrasher, and Avengers: The Initiative. Publication history Rage was created by Larry Hama and Paul Ryan and first appeared in The Avengers vol. 1 #326 (November 1990). Fictional character biography =Origin= Elvin Daryl Haliday was born in Brooklyn, New York. At age 13, he was exposed to toxic waste after hiding from bullies that attacked him for being in their neighborhood. Returning to his grandmother's home, Elvin was nursed back to health. The chemicals caused Elvin's teenage body to grow into adulthood in a matter of weeks, but also endowed him with superhuman strength, speed, and stamina. Encouraged by his grandmother to use his newfound abilities for good, Elvin adopted a costume and name: Rage. =Avengers= Soon after his transformation, Rage confronted the Avengers, demanding to be made a member. He scolded Captain America for the team's lack of any black members. Rage left after a brief scuffle, but ended up assisting the Avengers in their next mission against L.D.50. Alongside the Avengers, he battled other-dimensional alien prisoners.Avengers #326-328 After the team was reorganized under a new United Nations charter, Rage was invited to join as a probationary member. In one of his first adventures as an Avenger, Rage battled Doctor Doom, and discovered that this Doom was actually a robot duplicate.Avengers #329 During his Avengers career, he fought Ngh and the Tetrarchs of Entropy,Avengers #329-331 the Brethren, the Collector,Avengers #334-339 Brutus, and Grotesk.Avengers Annual #20; Avengers West Coast Annual #6 Rage was also shown, along with the Sandman, being trained by Captain America.Captain America #385 After racial tensions escalated due to the machinations of the energy vampire called the Hate-Monger, Rage and the New Warriors battled the Sons of the Serpent. The Avengers joined the fray, and Captain America was ultimately able to calm the situation and forced the Hate-Monger to retreat. During the battle, though, it came out that Rage was, in fact, only a teenager. Because of this, Cap told Rage that he could not be an Avenger, but could continue as a trainee if he wished. =New Warriors= Rage was dejected with the demotion. He soon helped the New Warriors and Darkhawk steal one of the Avengers' Quinjets for a mission to Cambodia to battle Tai and the Folding Circle. This Quinjet ended up being stolen by the Folding Circle, the very villains the New Warriors had gone off to fight.New Warriors #22-25 He was ultimately fired from the Avengers complete with a parting punch in the jaw from Hercules himself. About an hour later, he joined the New Warriors as a full member, and was given a new costume.New Warriors #26 With Speedball, Rage battled an evil duplicate, and defeated it by absorbing it into himself.New Warriors #27 As a member of the New Warriors, he battled Force of Nature, the Trans-Saballian army,New Warriors #29-30 and, with Spider-Man, Archangel, and Doctor Strange, went up against Darkforce.New Warriors #32-34; New Warriors Annual #3 During his time with the New Warriors, Elvin's grandmother Edna Staples was killed right before his eyes by a street gang called the Poison Memories, bent on revenge against the team, leaving him an orphan. He donned a new costume after that, complete with a metal helmet.New Warriors #37 Andrew Chord, the legal guardian of his teammate Night Thrasher, became Elvin's legal guardian. For some time, Rage was in legal trouble with the authorities, as he had been accused of murdering Kimeiko Ashu, the leader of the Poison Memories. He was ultimately cleared of all charges with the assistance of Night Thrasher, who later took him to Paris for a memorial service for his grandmother. Rage was part of the attacking force that traveled to a duplicate Earth on the far side of the moon during the Infinity Crusade. He teamed up with the X-Men member Cyclops and they were the closest to get to the villain's cathedral headquarters. Rage was swiftly dropped with a nerve pinch by Gamora and was out for the rest of the battle. Later, Rage and Night Thrasher were voted out of the New Warriors after they had been absent during the team's battle with the paramilitary group Undertow who had enslaved their teammate Namorita.New Warriors #57 (March 1995) After their expulsion from the New Warriors, for a short time, Rage and Night Thrasher acted as mentors to their former foes, Psionex.New Warriors #60, 63 & 64 (June, September & October 1995) Later, Rage and Night Thrasher took it upon themselves to free Namorita from Undertow.New Warriors #72-74 (June‚ÄìAugust 1996) After doing so, all three returned to the New Warriors.New Warriors #75 (September 1996) Eventually, though, the team began to drift apart and Night Thrasher formally disbanded them.Nova (vol. 3) #3 (July 1999) =Reserve Avenger= After the New Warriors broke up, Elvin left for boarding school.New Warriors (vol. 2) #0 (June 1999) Speedball contacted him to join a new version of the team, but Elvin turned him down, preferring to concentrate on his studies.New Warriors (vol. 2) #1 (October 1999) Elvin remained inactive as an adventurer and only returned a couple of times when called on as a reserve Avenger. First, he assisted the team against Morgan le Fay after the heroes returned from the Heroes Reborn universe.Avengers (vol. 3) #1-4 (February‚ÄìMay 1998) He later assisted them during the Avengers Disassembled situation.Avengers #501-503 (October‚ÄìDecember 2004) =Civil War= Rage and former teammate Justice learned that people were hunting down former New Warriors members because of the deathsShe-Hulk vol. 2, #8 (July, 2006) caused by Nitro.Civil War #1 They both sought the legal services of Jennifer Walters in protecting the allies of the New Warriors. They eventually discover that former New Warriors member Carlton Lafroyge (Hindsight Lad) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates. Hindsight had been operating a website outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors; he was also operating a dead pool. When John Jameson arrives, he arrests Hindsight. Rage remains on the scene until Jameson asks She-Hulk to marry him. Both Rage and Justice decided to side with Captain America during the Civil War, and refused to go along with the proposed Superhuman Registration Act. Rage is seen escaping from the containment van that held those that refused to comply with the Act.Amazing Spider-Man #534Fantastic Four #539 =The Initiative= Sometime later, Rage is seen on board a bus of new recruits arriving at Camp Hammond.Avengers: The Initiative #1 During his time in the Initiative program, Rage is subjected to constant verbal abuse by Gauntlet about his former teammates, the New Warriors, due to the Stamford tragedy. Rage is among the recruits helping people get to safety during World War Hulk.Avengers: The Initiative #4 After witnessing the battle between the Hulk and Iron Man, Rage orders the recruits to follow him and help battle the green gamma monster. However, they only see Hulk and his Warbound with the defeated Avengers lying at their feet. The recruits are defeated and imprisoned at Madison Square Garden and fitted with obedience disks to prevent their escape. They are subsequently rescued by the Shadow Initiative.Avengers: The Initiative #5 The recruits (except for Komodo, who had obeyed orders not to engage the Hulk) are then subjected to even more verbal abuse and more intense training by Gauntlet as punishment for breaking ranks. Shortly thereafter, Gauntlet is found beaten nearly to death with a New Warriors \\"NW\\" scrawled across his chest in his own blood.Avengers: The Initiative#6 All former New Warriors members and associates on base are detained for questioning. During the S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation, Rage reveals that he had an altercation with Gauntlet the day before the assault and that Gauntlet was about to recommend washing him out of the program and that his powers be removed until he turns 18. During the Dark Reign storyline, Rage quits the Initiative along with other New Warriors- associated cadets (Justice, Debrii, Slapstick, and the remaining Scarlet Spiders) to form Counter Force.Avengers: The Initiative #12 He later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,Avengers: The Initiative #21 and battled Ragnarok, the clone of Thor.Avengers: The Initiative #22 =Fear Itself= During the Fear Itself storyline, Rage appears at a meeting held by Prodigy regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the Earth.Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt #1 Rage and other heroes then battle Juggernaut, who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in Las Vegas, Nevada.Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt #3 He is then seen with Debrii rescuing survivors and helps the team in their battle against Thor Girl, who had recovered her designate powers.Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt #4 & #6 =Secret Wars 2015= During the Secret Wars storyline, Demolition Man met Rage and Edwin Jarvis at Avengers Mansion during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. The two enjoyed a brief career as Luchadore wrestlers.Secret Wars Too #1 =Civil War II= During the Civil War II storyline, Rage comes to the aid of local neighborhoods in Brooklyn who are being attacked by the Americops, a private police force funded by Keane Industries. When confronting the Americops, Sam Wilson, the current Captain America, shows up to stop the fight and contain the situation, only to end up fighting the Americops himself. Rage jumps in to help Sam, but is later evacuated from the battle by the new Falcon. After Sam defeats U.S. Agent, Rage delivers a speech, where he complains that Sam cares more about his reputation than others and that people need him to stand up for them.Captain America: Sam Wilson #11-13 =Captain America: Sam Wilson= Rage goes to Empire State University with the new Falcon, to confront an anti-immigrant politician who was giving a speech at campus. They later face the Bombshells, a trio of armored protesters, and defeat them. While returning home, Rage encounters Man Mountain Marko and Speed Demon, who were robbing a pawn shop. After a brief fight, the villains escape and Rage is arrested by the Americops.Captain America: Sam Wilson #17 When Captain America offers him professional help, Rage turns it down, preferring to have him prove his innocence. Sam does that by releasing footage of the Americops beating him.Captain America: Sam Wilson #18 Judge David Roderick deemed the footage inadmissible and had Rage convicted. In order to get better proof of Rage's innocence, Sam later caught Speed Demon where he confessed to his and Man Mountain Marko's robbery of the pawn shop.Captain America: Sam Wilson #19 Rage is then beaten up in a penitentiary's Z Block by the super-powered prisoners which he previously apprehended. He was taken to the hospital. While visiting him, Sam is told by Claire Temple that Rage will not survive due to the extensive brain damage he sustained.Captain America: Sam Wilson #20 =Death= Rage eventually recovered from his coma, against all odds, and when the Hive's invaded Earth, they sent agents to force symbiotes into bonding with superhumans, so a Poison could assimilate both the symbiote and its host. Together with D-Man, Rage oversaw the evacuation of Manhattan across the Manhattan Bridge. They were both attacked by a group of Poisons and bonded to symbiotes. Shortly afterwards, Rage and his symbiote were consumed by a Poison, resulting in their deaths.Venomized #2 Powers and abilities Elvin's exposure to unknown biochemical radioactive wastes gave him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability and resistance to physical injury. He becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting. He is able to use his enhanced strength to leap great distances. In his first appearance, Rage was shown outrunning a speeding subway train, but this ability has not been used again. Rage possesses basic street-fighting skills, and has received some combat training from Captain America and Night Thrasher. Rage usually wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric and body armor, and formerly wore a helmet of unspecified material, all of which he designed for himself.

For natural images this assumption is usually correct except at specific points, e.g., corners or line junctions or crossings, or in regions of high frequency textures. However, what size the regions have to be in order to appear as one-dimensional varies both between images and within an image. Also, in practice a local region is never exactly one-dimensional but can be so to a sufficient degree of approximation. Image regions which are one-dimensional are also referred to as simple or intrinsic one-dimensional (i1D). Given an image of dimension d (d = 2 for ordinary images), a mathematical representation of a local i1D image region is f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = g(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n}) where f is the image intensity function which varies over a local image coordinate \\\\mathbf{x} (a d-dimensional vector), g is a one-variable function, and \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} is a unit vector. The intensity function f is constant in all directions which are perpendicular to \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n}. Intuitively, the orientation of an i1D-region is therefore represented by the vector \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n}. However, for a given f, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} is not uniquely determined. If \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf n} = - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} \\\\tilde{g}(x) = g(-x) then f can be written as f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\tilde{g}(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf n}) which implies that \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf n} = - \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} also is a valid representation of the local orientation. In order to avoid this ambiguity in the representation of local orientation two representations have been proposed * The double angle representation * The tensor representation The double angle representation is only valid for 2D images (d=2), but the tensor representation can be defined for arbitrary dimensions d of the image data. Relation to direction A line between two points p1 and p2 has no given direction, but has a well-defined orientation. However, if one of the points p1 is used as a reference or origin, then the other point p2 can be described in terms of a vector which points in the direction to p2. Intuitively, orientation can be thought of as a direction without sign. Formally, this relates to projective spaces where the orientation of a vector corresponds to the equivalence class of vectors which are scaled versions of the vector. For an image edge, we may talk of its direction which can be defined in terms of the gradient, pointing in the direction of maximum image intensity increase (from dark to bright). This implies that two edges can have the same orientation but the corresponding image gradients point in opposite directions if the edges go in different directions. Relation to gradients In image processing, the computation of the local image gradient is a common operation, e.g., for edge detection. If f above is an edge, then its gradient is parallel to \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n}. As is already discussed above the gradient is not a unique representation of orientation. Also, in the case of a local region which is centered on a line, the image gradient is approximately zero. However, in this case the vector \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} is still well-defined except for its sign. Therefore, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf n} is a more appropriate starting point for defining local orientation than the image gradient. Estimation of local image orientation A number of methods have been proposed for computing or estimating an orientation representation from image data. These include * Quadrature filter based methods * The structure tensor * Using a local polynomial approximation * The Energy tensorFelsberg, Michael, and G√∂sta Granlund. \\"POI detection using channel clustering and the 2D energy tensor.\\" Joint Pattern Recognition Symposium. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2004. * The Boundary tensorK√∂the, Ullrich. \\"Integrated Edge and Junction Detection with the Boundary Tensor.\\" ICCV. Vol. 3. 2003. The first approach can be used both for the double angle representation (only 2D images) and the tensor representation, and the other methods compute a tensor representation of local orientation. Application of local image orientation Given that a local image orientation representation has been computed for some image data, this formation can be used for solving the following tasks: * Estimation of line or edge consistency * Estimation of curvature information * Detection of corner pointsChabat, Fran√ßois, Guang- Zhong Yang, and David M.

It is the capital city of Nasarawa State and has a population of 330,712 inhabitants according to the 2006 census results. It is the largest town in Nasarawa state. History Lafia, also known as Lafian Beri-Beri, is the capital city of Nasarawa State, central Nigeria. Founded by Muhammadu Dunama in late 17th century on the site of a Koro (Migili) village. The indigenous Koro migrated southwards to Agyaragu, Anise etc. The town now has its 17th Emir in the person of Hon. Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad I JSC rtd. Lafia became the capital of a prominent local chiefdom in the late 19th century. During the rule of Mohamman Agwai (1881‚Äì1903), the Lafia market became one of the most important in the Benue Valley, and a trade route was opened to Loko (56 mi [90 km] southwest), a Benue River port. In 1903 the British, who controlled Northern Nigeria recognized Chief Musa as Lafia's first emir. The emirate formed the major part of the Lafia Division of Benue province. In 1967 the town became part of Benue-Plateau state, and in 1976 it was allocated to Plateau state. Lafia is populated mainly by the Eggon, Alago, Kanuri, Aho and Koro. It also has large populations of Igbo, Hausa, Mwaghavul settlers amongst other tribes. This is due to the hospitable nature of the indigenes and has made the city a miniature Nigeria. Modern Lafia aside from being an administrative and educational center, it is also a collecting point for sesame seeds, soybeans, and is a trading centre for yams, sorghum, millet, and cotton. Besides farming, cotton weaving and dyeing are traditionally important activities of the town's inhabitants. Livestock farming is also a prominent activity especially amongst the Fulani herdsmen. The two royal families of Ari and Dallah Dunama of the Kanuri people (Beri-Beri, Kambari) are the ruling houses of the Lafia Emirate. The current Emir is Sidi Bage, from the Dallah Dunama royal family. He succeeded the longest reigning Emir,late HRH Isa Mustapha Agwai I. (1976 - 2019). Institutions Lafia is home to the Federal University of Lafia, Nasarawa State University Faculty of Agriculture Lafia Campus, Isa Mustapha Agwai I Polytechnic Lafia, School of Nursing And Midwifery, School of Health Technology LAFIA, College of Agriculture Lafia, and a study centre of the National Open University of Nigeria. It has a large number of primary and secondary schools. The St Williams Cathedral, situated along Jos road, is the headquarters of the Lafia diocese and though still under construction, is an awesome sight to behold. It is situated on the trunk railway from Port Harcourt and on the main highway between Makurdi and Jos. Population of (2006) census in Lafia local government area was estimated 330,712. Sports Lafia is the location of Nasarawa United, a football club whose stadium is Lafia Township Stadium. Transportation Lafia is served by the main narrow gauge railway from Port Harcourt.

Namesake As the area was a well known hideout of Chief Victorio, the peak was named after him. Briefings used by the U.S. Army prior to Operation Goldfinder labeled the mountain as Victoria Peak. Officials at the Range followed the lead of New Mexico historians, who erroneously believed the peak was named after Queen Victoria. Through diligent research, Howard Bryan, a reporter for the Albuquerque Tribune, linked Victorio with the Battle of Hembrillo Basin and discovered the peak's original namesake.Chandler, David L.

One such claim was by Milton Ernest \\"Doc\\" Noss, who claimed to have found treasure but was murdered by an associate.

The two terms were once used in the ancient Catholic universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, as an alternative name for the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD), a practice which has now been discontinued. Overview The degree builds upon the work of the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB) and the Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL). Normally, the STB is earned in three years, provided the candidate has at least two years of undergraduate study of philosophy before entering an STB program (if not, the STB will take five years; Sapientia Christiana assumes this to be the normal situation). The STL is normally earned in an additional two years, and the STD is earned after the writing, defense and publication of the doctoral dissertation (an additional 2‚Äì3 years). At institutions that offer both civil and church doctorates, the requirements of the STD will usually‚Äîalthough not always‚Äîbe shaped so that those reading for the award can receive a ThD or PhD in the process of meeting the requirements of the STD. This compares with, for example in North American institutions, the four-year program for a BA at many universities, a two-year program for an MA, and the writing and successful defense of the doctoral dissertation for the PhD or ThD (an additional 2‚Äì3 years). A sketch of the degree cycle and requirements for ecclesiastical degrees can be found in John Paul II's apostolic constitution, Sapientia Christiana.Sapientia Christiana The STD, or the Doctor of Canon Law (DCL or JCD), is the preferred qualification for teaching theology or canon law on a Catholic university faculty or for holding certain other posts of administration. In addition, the STD is usually required for a permanent post on the theology faculty of an ecclesiastical or pontifical university. However, this requirement can be waived if a teacher holds an STL. John Paul II's Sapientia Christiania notes that in the event where a doctorate is non- canonical, \\"the teacher will usually be required to have at least a canonical licentiate.\\" (SC, Article 17). In the US, although it may have more stringent entry requirements than a PhD in theology, it is a research degree that is considered by the US National Science Foundation to be the equivalent of a Doctor of Philosophy. Former usage STP This degree has sometimes been referred to as (STP), \\"Professor of Sacred Theology\\", even when the individuals holding it were not professors in the present-day sense of the word; this stems from the mediaeval usage of 'professor', 'doctor' and 'master' as synonymous terms for the highest degree. Inscriptions survive on several ancient monuments in English and Welsh and Church of Ireland churches and in University buildings which use this abbreviation to denote holders of the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD).

The most successful singles from the album were \\"Juegos De Seducci√≥n\\" (Games of Seduction/Seduction Games), \\"Nada Personal\\" (Nothing Personal) and \\"Cuando pase el temblor\\" (When the Earthquake Ends). Those songs enjoyed strong airplay during 1985 and 1986, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and Chile. Such successful songs were performed live twice at the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival held in Chile in February, 1987. Many people (including music journalists) consider these two shows very historic.

Diana Greenway (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996), p. lxi Henry, the Archdeacon of Huntingdon, had visited Bec in 1139 and during his stay there provided Robert with much of the information regarding the reign of Henry I which Robert used in his own chronicles. Robert, in turn, introduced Henry to a new work by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the Historia Regum Britanniae, a copy of which first reached Bec circa 1138. John Bale, the sixteenth-century English churchman and historian, in his Index Britanniae Scriptorum, identified Robert as the author of two Arthurian romances, based in part by the author's initialing his work with the letter \\"R\\". These were De Ortu Waluuanii and Historia Meriadoci, but this identification remains controversial and is doubted by some authorities.Dr. James Bruce analyzed the writing style of these two romances compared to the writings of Robert de Torigni. His opinion was they did not match, and also pointed out how Bale made the mistake of attributing these romances to Robert based on an incorrect assumption. Additional evidence shows these romances to be the products of thirteenth century writers, not twelfth. See: Two Arthurian Romances of the XIIIth Century in Latin Prose, ed. J.

He was the eldest of the ten children of Martin Bormann. Early life Bormann was born in Gr√ºnwald, Bavaria, the oldest of the ten children of the head of the Nazi Party Chancellery and private secretary to F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler, Martin Bormann (1900‚Äì1945) and his wife, Gerda Buch (1909‚Äì1946). Nicknamed Kr√∂nzi, short for Kronprinz (German for crown prince), he was an ardent young Nazi, attending the Nazi Party Academy of Matrei am Brenner in the Tyrol from 1940 to 1945. On 15 April 1945, the school closed and young Martin was advised by a party functionary in Munich, named Hummel, to try to reach his mother in the still German-occupied hamlet of Val Gardena/Gr√∂den, near Selva/Wolkenstein in Italian South Tyrol. Unable to get there, he found himself stranded in Salzburg where the Gauleiter provided him with false identity papers and he found hospitality with a Catholic farmer, Nikolaus Hohenwarter, at the Querleitnerhof, halfway up a mountain in the Salzburg Alps. Post-war After Germany surrendered, his mother, Gerda, was subjected to intense interrogationLebert, p. 95 by officers of the CIC (Combined Intelligence Committee, the joint American-British intelligence body). She died of abdominal cancerLebert, p. 97 in the prison hospital at Merano on 23 April 1946. The following year, her teenage son Martin learned of his mother's death from an article in the Salzburger Nachrichten and only then confessed his true identity to Nikolas Hohenwarter, who reported the information to his local priest at Wei√übach bei Lofer. Subsequently the priest advised the rector of the Church of Maria Kirchtal, who then took the boy into his care. Bormann converted to Catholicism. While serving as an altar boy at Maria Kirchtal, he was arrested by American intelligence officers and imprisoned at Zell am See for several days of interrogation before being returned to his parish. He stayed there until he joined the religious congregation of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in Ingolstadt. He had been able to resume contact with his brothers and sisters, all of whom, except for one sister, had also been received into the Catholic Church. After Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945, his fugitive father Martin Bormann vanished. Martin A. Bormann said he did not know what happened to his father when interrogated: he was repeatedly tested for lies but was deemed truthful. Over the coming years, several organisations, including the CIA and the West German Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In 1971 Bormann supported the government officials' conclusion that the disappearance of Martin Bormann Sr. was inconclusive and the search for Bormann Sr. was officially ended in November 1971. Thereafter, on 7 December 1972, construction workers uncovered human remains near Lehrter station in West Berlin. During a postmortem fragments of glass were found in the jaw of the skeleton, which was identified as Martin Bormann Sr. through reconstructed dental records; the glass fragments suggested he had committed suicide by biting a cyanide capsule to avoid capture. Forensic examiners determined that the size of the skeleton and shape of the skull were identical to Bormann's. The remains were conclusively identified as Bormann's in 1998 when German authorities ordered genetic testing on fragments of the skull. On 16 August 1999, the remains were cremated and Martin Bormann Jr. was permitted to scatter his father's ashes in the Baltic Sea. =Life as a priest= On 26 July 1958,MSC (Missionnaires du Sacr√©-Coeur de J√©sus). 1963.

He left the priesthood in the early 1970s, and they later both renounced their vows and were married in 1971. They never had any children. Bormann became a teacher of theology and retired in 1992. In 2001, he toured schools in Germany and Austria, speaking about the horrors of the Third Reich, and even visited Israel, meeting with Holocaust survivors. In 2011, Bormann was accused by a former pupil at an Austrian Catholic boarding school of having raped him as a 12-year-old when Bormann was working there as a priest and schoolmaster in the early 1960s. Other former pupils alleged severe physical violence had been used against them and others. Suffering from dementia, Bormann was unwilling and/or incapable to comment on the accusations. No legal proceedings followed, but the independent , established to investigate abuse by Catholic Church members in Austria, awarded the accuser compensation. Bormann died in 2013 in Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

In its substance, it states an absolute upper bound for the deviation of one perturbed matrix eigenvalue from a properly chosen eigenvalue of the exact matrix. Informally speaking, what it says is that the sensitivity of the eigenvalues is estimated by the condition number of the matrix of eigenvectors. The theorem was proved by Friedrich L. Bauer and C. T. Fike in 1960. The setup In what follows we assume that: * is a diagonalizable matrix; * is the non-singular eigenvector matrix such that , where is a diagonal matrix. * If is invertible, its condition number in -norm is denoted by and defined by: ::\\\\kappa_p(X)=\\\\X\\\\_p \\\\left \\\\X^{-1} \\\\right \\\\_p.

We can suppose , otherwise take and the result is trivially true since . Since is an eigenvalue of , we have and so :\\\\begin{align} 0 &= \\\\det(A+\\\\delta A-\\\\mu I) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det(V^{-1})\\\\det(A+\\\\delta A-\\\\mu I)\\\\det(V) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det \\\\left ( V^{-1} (A+\\\\delta A-\\\\mu I) V \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det \\\\left ( V^{-1}AV + V^{-1}\\\\delta AV- V^{-1} \\\\mu I V \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det \\\\left (\\\\Lambda+V^{-1}\\\\delta AV-\\\\mu I \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det(\\\\Lambda-\\\\mu I)\\\\det \\\\left ((\\\\Lambda-\\\\mu I)^{-1}V^{-1}\\\\delta AV +I \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} However our assumption, , implies that: and therefore we can write: :\\\\det \\\\left ((\\\\Lambda-\\\\mu I)^{-1}V^{-1}\\\\delta AV +I \\\\right ) = 0. This reveals to be an eigenvalue of :(\\\\Lambda-\\\\mu I)^{-1}V^{-1}\\\\delta AV. Since all -norms are consistent matrix norms we have where is an eigenvalue of .

At the age of 18 Houlding became the first Briton to free climb El Capitan in the Yosemite Valley, and has gone on to climb many of its toughest lines. Houlding began rock climbing at the age of 10. In 1996, he became the British Junior Indoor Climbing Champion. He spent the summer of 1997 living in and around Llanberis in North Wales. The summer was notable for having many well known UK climbers in the region at the same time, including Adam Wainwright, Tim Emmett, Simon Panton, Patch Hammond and others; some important new routes were established during that season. He became the subject of the 2003 TV documentary \\"My Right Foot\\" which was part of the Extreme Lives series aired on BBC Television. Houlding appeared in the BBC television programme Top Gear in which he raced presenter Jeremy Clarkson up a cliff face in Verdon Gorge, winning the challenge. Houlding, joined by Tim Emmett, climbed the canyon whilst Clarkson drove an Audi RS4 to the top using the surrounding roads. He has also appeared several times on the Audi Channel. He joined the 2007 Altitude Everest Expedition, led by American climber and mountaineer, Conrad Anker, retracing the last steps of legendary British climber, George Mallory, on Mount Everest. In 2008, Houlding presented Take Me to the Edge, a British reality series on Virgin1 (later repeated on STV); and signed a deal with Ford Motor Company to become a brand ambassador for their pick up truck, the Ford Ranger. In August 2009 he led a team of climbers and film makers to Mount Asgard on Baffin Island, Canada. They attempted to free climb a 15 pitch route up the north face of the mountain to create the first free route. Although over half of the ascent was eventually freed, the team were unable to complete the full free ascent within the available time. Houlding and American team member Sean 'Stanley' Leary BASE jumped from the summit. The ascent took 12 days and is featured in the 2010 film The Asgard Project. He appeared in the 2010 film The Wildest Dream along with Conrad Anker retracing the steps of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine in order to recreate their journey up Mount Everest. In 2010 he completed his 10-year project \\"The Prophet\\", making him the first Briton to complete a new free route on the famous El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, California. Houlding, in a talk at Kennedy School in Hong Kong, has stated that he fell in love with rock climbing when he went climbing with his father's friend at the age of ten. He also remarked that climbing was a powerful and overwhelming experience. From December 2012 to January 2013, a team led by Houlding and including Alastair Lee, Chris Rabone, Sean Leary, Jason Pickles and David Reeves made the first ascent of a new route up the north-east ridge of Ulvetanna Peak in Antarctica. The peak was described as 'the most demanding peak on the world's toughest continent' via its fearsome north-east ridge. The film that was produced, The Last Great Climb premiered in London on 5 November 2013. In 2020 Houlding's entire family reached the summit of the Piz Badile, including his seven year old daughter who climbed it unaided (the youngest ever to reach the summit), and his 3-year old son (carried on his mother's back).

Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary page The Waddell Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of East and West Waddell Creeks, and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Waddell Beach, just south of A√±o Nuevo Point. History The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping for three days at Waddell Creek, October 20‚Äì22, 1769, and initially named the creek Ca√±ada de San Luis Beltran. The longer stay was because of heavy rains, and fears that the weather would worsen the condition of those in the party who were sick. Instead, as Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \\"it seemed as though God had sent them health with the drenching, for to the surprise of everybody they began to improve, and in a short time were entirely recovered, thanks to God, to whom we attributed this special blessing. For this reason the valley was renamed Ca√±ada de la La Salud.\\" William Waddell of Kentucky came to California in 1851. The first American settler of the area (for whom the creek and valley are named), he built a sawmill on the creek in 1862 above the Waddell Forks and conducted an extensive timber harvesting operation in the area, a lumber-hauling tramway from the mill to the beach, and a wharf.Rancho del Oso - History Waddell was killed by a grizzly bear in 1875. Hiking Western Waddell Creek and then Waddell Creek mostly coexist with the 34.5 mi. (55.5 km) hiking trail which descends from Sanborn Park at the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains, called the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail. The hike along the creek is very popular among hiking enthusiasts. Watershed and Course The Waddell Creek mainstem is long although total distance from headwater source tributaries to the sea is . The Waddell Creek watershed drains and consists of many headwater creeks that feed its two tributaries, East and West Waddell Creeks. West Waddell Creek has its source at along the border of Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties, while East Waddell Creek's source is at the confluence of Opal Creek and Blooms Creek at just below Big Basin Redwoods State Park headquarters in Santa Cruz County. Some of the uppermost headwaters streams originate above . Ecology Historically, Waddell Creek was home to spawning runs by both steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In 1995 a review of coho south of San Francisco Bay found coho restricted to only one remnant population in Waddell Creek, one small naturalized (hatchery-influenced) population in Scott Creek and a small hatchery-maintained, non-native run in the San Lorenzo River, all in Santa Cruz County. Historically, coho were found in approximately 50 coastal drainages in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, but by the 1960s spawning runs were limited to 11 stream systems. The 1995 combined average annual spawning population of native and naturalized coho salmon in Waddell and Scott Creeks was estimated at only 50-60 adults, comprising only 1.5% of the estimated abundance of coho salmon south of San Francisco Bay in the early 1960s. Coho vanished from Waddell Creek but there is hope of returns from the Kingfisher Flat Hatchery on the Big Creek tributary to nearby Scott Creek where the salmon returned in 2015 due to stocking efforts. Usable salmonid spawning and rearing habitat is limited by the distance from Waddell Forks (elevation ) to Slippery Falls (elevation on West Waddell Creek and the from Waddell Forks to the Main Falls on East Waddell Creek (elevation . The upper stream banks are in the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) belt of the Santa Cruz Mountains while the lower stream banks are lined by red alder (Alnus rubra), big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), California buckeye (Aesculus californica), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), California laurel (Umbellularia californica), and, in the lowermost portion, by willows (Salix spp.). Occasionally encountered are tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora), box elder (Acer negundo subsp. californicum), white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), California nutmeg (Torreya californica), and coast Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii).

The Land Run of 1867 opened the area to non-Indian settlement, when it became part of County F. It became part of Roger Mills County after Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Before the American Civil War, this area was part of Comancheria, because the Comanche tribe regarded the land as their hunting ground and cattle grazing land. They vigorously opposed settlements by white immigrants and non-indigenous Native Americans, leading to much destruction and bloodshed. The U. S. military was ineffective in stopping Comanche raids into Texas and Mexico. Finally, the Texas Rangers and some Native American allies began a campaign in 1858 to eliminate the problem. The campaign culminated in the Battle of Little Robe Creek on May 12, 1858. After gold was discovered in California in 1848, the large number of people traveling west created a need for a wagon road. Captain Randolph B. Marcy was commissioned to lead a party to survey the route for such a road from Fort Smith to California. This became known as the California Road. Marcy described the Antelope Hills as, \\". . . about one hundred and fifty feet high, of porous sandstone, and appear to be the result of volcanic action. They rise almost perpendicularly from the smooth prairie, are flat upon the top, and present every indication of having been raised out of the earth by volcanic agency.

He opposed social liberalisation, particularly the legalisation of abortion, divorce and same-sex marriage, and was one of the founders of the anti-abortion advocacy group, Pro Life Campaign. Personal life Hanafin was born in Thurles, County Tipperary, in 1930, son of John Hanafin (1890‚Äì1953), a draper and newsagent who served for many years as a Fianna F√°il councillor for North Tipperary County Council and previously was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and an elected Sinn F√©in councillor.Interview with Des and Mary Hanafin, Miriam Meets, 18 April 2010. He married Mona Brady, daughter of J. P. Brady, on 28 August 1958 in Clonmel, Tipperary. The wedding was followed by a reception at the Galtee Hotel, Cahir, which was attended by various notables including Rev. Father J. J. Hampson, President of Blackrock College. Their first child, Mary Hanafin, was born in June 1959, followed by John Hanafin in September 1960. Mary Hanafin is a former Fianna F√°il TD and government minister, and John Hanafin is a former Fianna F√°il senator. Hanafin operated the Anner Hotel, located in Thurles during the 1960s. Initially successful, the business failed in 1967, which Mary Hanafin later blamed on her father's excess drinking. Subsequently, Hanafin was a director of the Transinternational Oil Company. Political career Hanafin's first attempt to be elected to public office proved unsuccessful. In 1953, Hanafin sought to be co-opted to fill the vacancy on North Tipperary County Council created by the death of his father, John Hanafin. In the event councillors co-opted a Labour Party nominee, Michael Treacy, by eleven votes to seven. He was elected a member of North Tipperary County Council in 1955, polling 934 first preference votes. Subsequently, in 1956, drawing support from the Clann na Poblachta representatives, he was elected Chairman of the County Council. In 1957, he conducted a three-month tour of the United States, during which he was commissioned a Kentucky colonel, by then Kentucky Governor Albert \\"Happy\\" Chandler. He was also awarded the freedom of Louisville, Kentucky, and received by Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. Hanafin was re-elected to North Tipperary County Council in 1960, polling 797 first preference votes. In 1961, he voted against the Fianna F√°il nominee for Chair of the County Council, Thomas F. Meagher, and in favour of the Clann na Poblachta nominee, Michael F. Cronin, who was elected by 10 votes to 9. In 1964, he controversially voted in favour of Jeremiah Mockler, \\"a former school mate\\", who was elected by 10 votes to 9 to the office of Rate Collector for Borrisokane. He held the seat until 1985. He was first elected to Seanad √âireann in 1969 and retained his seat until the 1993 Seanad election at which he lost his seat by one vote. He regained his seat in the 1997 elections, and in 2002 announced his retirement from politics. He unsuccessfully contested the 1977 and 1981 D√°il elections for the Tipperary North constituency. He was a chief fundraiser of the Fianna F√°il party for many years. =Social issues= Homosexuality In May 2015, he accused equality campaigners in the marriage equality referendum of spreading a \\"palpable climate of fear\\", and called for a No vote. Divorce He opposed the legalisation of divorce, which was introduced in 1995, and attempted to overturn the referendum result in the Supreme Court, but was refused by the court. Abortion An opponent of abortion, Hanafin was one of the promoters of the constitutional amendment that enshrined the legal ban on abortion in the Constitution of Ireland.

Xaudio is an Xbox-only API designed for optimal digital signal processing. XACT also includes X3DAudio, a spatialization helper library available on both platforms, Windows and the Xbox. XACT was originally developed for Xbox development, and was later modified to work for Microsoft Windows development as well. Overview The original release of XACT was in 2002 and shipped as part of the Xbox SDK only and was originally called the \\"Xbox Audio Creation Tool\\". It was designed to allow sound designers and composers for the original Xbox console to have access and control of the powerful MCPx audio chip in the console, which previously could only be accessed through program code, via Xbox extensions to DirectSound. XACT was the first widely available game audio tool that allowed a sound designer to run a tool connected to a running game and modify the sounds in real time, as the game was running, and support easy streaming of audio data from the console hard drive. Later, under the XNA initiative, it was re- written to work on both Windows and Xbox and renamed the \\"Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool\\" and included as part of the DirectX SDK. Support for XACT has been carried over from DirectX to XNA. The XACT Audio Authoring Tool is also available in XNA Game Studio. With the release of Windows SDK for Windows 8 Developer Preview, XACT is no longer supported on Windows.MSDN - Windows Development - Where is the DirectX SDK? The XACT Audio Authoring Tool is a companion application used to organize audio assets into wave banks (single files containing multiple WAV files) and sound banks (single files containing instructions for playing the WAV files in wave banks).

Sounds are made up of tracks. *** Tracks - tracks are made up of events E.g. the simplest track has a Play Wave event *** Events - various actions that take place within a track. Actions include: Play, Stop, Set Volume, Set Pitch etc. ** Cues - a cue is used in code to trigger sounds. Each cue is made up of one or more sounds * Wave Banks (.xwb) - a file format containing a collection of waves ** Waves - the raw wave data in wav, aiff or xma format * Global Settings (.xgs) - defines rules and settings for sounds. ** Categories - sounds can be assigned to a category (only one each) that specifies certain rules like number of instances along with settings like volume. You could create a category for the sounds of one character in your game so they all have the same volume. There are three predefined categories: global, default and Music. ** Variables - these can be defined in the design stage and then referenced by the programmer in code to control Run-Time Parameter Controls *** Run-Time Parameter Controls - also known as 'sliders'. These allow the control of sound parameters as the sound plays. For example, they could be used to control the pitch of a car engine sound so as the accelerator is pressed the pitch is changed ** DSP Effect Path Presets (DSPs) - allow effects like reverb to be applied to sounds ** Compression Presets - compression can be applied to waves or wave banks References External links * XACT on MultimediaWiki Category:Audio libraries Category:DirectX Category:Microsoft development tools Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology Category:Xbox development ","title":"Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool"},{"id":"2997686","title":"List of machine guns"},{"id":"2997688","text":"William Clintard Robinzine (January 20, 1953 - September 16, 1982) was an American professional basketball player.

He is perhaps best remembered for his inclusion in the highlight footage of Darryl Dawkins' backboard-shattering dunk at Kansas City's Kemper Arena on November 13, 1979. Robinzine, who was under the basket at the time, fled while shielding his face in order to avoid falling glass, which inspired Dawkins to include the phrase \\"Robinzine Cryin'\\" when later creating a name for the dunk. While not much of a scorer, Robinzine was known as a tough rebounder and one of the better defensive players in the league at the power forward position.

It may have been the first public example of the mainstream media publicizing a \\"curse\\" on a major-league sports franchise. History =Supposed curse= The Hawks' first season, 1926‚Äì27, was a moderate success, with the forward line of Mickey MacKay, Babe Dye, and Dick Irvin each finishing near the top of the league's scoring race. The Hawks lost their 1927 first-round playoff series to the Boston Bruins. Following this series, team owner Frederic McLaughlin fired head coach Pete Muldoon. Jim Coleman, a sportswriter for The Globe and Mail wrote in 1943 that the reason for Muldoon's firing boiled down to a heated end-of-season argument with McLaughlin. As the story goes, McLaughlin felt that the Black Hawks were good enough to finish first in the American Division. Muldoon disagreed, and McLaughlin fired him. Muldoon supposedly responded, \\"Fire me, Major, and you'll never finish first. I'll put a curse on this team that will hoodoo it until the end of time.\\" Coleman later admitted that he had invented the \\"curse\\" to meet a deadline. At the time, finishing in first place was considered to be as much of an achievement as winning the Stanley Cup. While the team would win the Stanley Cup in 1934 (defeating the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals), 1938 (defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs) and 1961 (again defeating the Red Wings), they would do so without having finished in first place either in a multi-division or a single- league format. =Effectiveness of curse= In 1967, the last season of the six-team NHL, the Hawks finished first, breaking the supposed Curse of Muldoon, 23 years after the death of McLaughlin. However, they lost the Stanley Cup Semifinals to the Maple Leafs. Afterward, sportswriter Jim Coleman, who first printed the story of the curse in 1943, admitted that he made the story up to break a writer's block he had as a column deadline approached.

The GRO is or was the government agency responsible for the recording of vital records such as births, deaths, and marriages (or BDM), which may also include adoptions, stillbirths, civil unions, etc., and historically, sometimes included records relating to deeds and other property transactions. The director of a General Register Office is or was often titled Registrar General or Registrar-General. By country =Australia= The Australian states and territories have similar registries for birth, death and marriage, although their histories differ. These agencies are usually subordinate to the state Attorney-General Department or Department of Justice. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is responsible for collating the statistics based on these records. ACT: Until 1930, records were registered in the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Since December 2014, an agency known as Access Canberra, a \\"one-stop shop for ACT Government customer and regulatory services\\", part of the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate, is responsible for BDM registrations. NSW: In New South Wales, compulsory civil registration began in 1856. The Act for Registering Births, Deaths and Marriages 1856 allowed the Governor to appoint a Registrar General and establish an office in Sydney to register all births, deaths and marriages in the colony. District registrars recorded the details. The Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages is now an agency within the NSW Department of Customer Service. About 90% of births in the state are now registered online. Northern Territory: In the Northern Territory, the Registrar-General is responsible for both Births, Deaths and Marriages and the Land Titles Office. Queensland: Queensland started compulsory registration of life events in 1856, under the Registrar General. Today, births, deaths and marriages are administered by a unit within the Department of Justice. South Australia: In South Australia, the local equivalent of the GRO is commonly known as the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages, within the state Attorney-General's Department. \\"General Law Title\\" or the \\"Old System Title\\" was the English land law adopted at the time of foundation of South Australia as a colony in December 1836. The General Registry Office (GRO) holds deeds and records of land transactions from 1837 until the implementation of Real Property Act in 1858 (known as Torrens title). After this, all new land transactions were conducted under the new system, using a land title. The role of the GRO included property transactions (mortgages, conveyances, leases, land grants, indentures, wills, probate), as well as deeds for a number of other actions (such as Deed Poll name changes). The documents called \\"memorials\\" represent those original deeds registered and held by the GRO, whereas the certified copies held by the GRO were known as \\"deposits\\" or \\"enrolments\\". The General Registry Office and Old Systems land records are (as of July 2019) held at the Land Services Group at Netley, where there are alphabetical indices of records from 1842 to the present, for land that does not fall under the Torrens title. These records include those of early landowners and pioneer settlers. Tasmania: The Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages was established in 1838, which was the first of all Australian colonies to take over this function from the churches. It went through various administrative and name changes until 1989, when it became the Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, under the Department of Justice. Victoria: The Registrar-General's Department was created on 18 January 1853, with the proclamation of the Registration (Births, Deaths and Marriages) Act. From 1 July that year, all residents of the colony of Victoria had to register births and deaths with their local District Registrar. Norman Campbell was the first permanent appointee to the position of Registrar-General. After his death, the position of Registrar-General devolved to statistician William Henry Archer (1825 ‚Äì 29 April 1909), who had acted in that position before Campbell's appointment and was seen as the driving force behind the department. The current incarnation of the department is Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages Victoria (BDM). Western Australia : Civil registration of births, deaths and marriages has been compulsory in Western Australia since 1841. From its beginnings as a function of the Colonial Secretary's Office (1828‚àí1924), the administration of BDM registration has gone through a number of changes. Since 1999 The Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages has been the responsible entity. =Canada= The Registrar General of Canada title belongs to a government minister with entirely different and unrelated functions ‚Äì such as registration of all letters patent, commissions, instruments, proclamations, and certain other documents. Each province and territory in Canada has a Registrar General responsible for collecting and storing records of births, marriages and deaths in their respective regions. =Hong Kong= The Hong Kong Government established a Registrar General in 1845, four years after the British acquired Hong Kong in 1841. The post was renamed the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs in 1913, and then Home Affairs in 1949. On 1 April 1949, the Land Office merged with various other functions, which included the Marriage Registry, to form the Registrar General's Department. In May 1993, the Registrar General's Department was disestablished and the Land Registry formed. The Births and Deaths General Register Office is now responsible for recording births and deaths, as part of the Immigration Department. =India= The Central Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act of 1886 provided for voluntary registration throughout British India. Twenty years after independence, Registration of Births and Death Act (RBD Act) of 1969 made registration mandatory. The Registrar General, India (RGI) coordinates registration activities across the country, although state governments are responsible for the collection of data. =Ireland= The General Register Office (Oifig An Ard-Chl√°raitheora) is the central civil repository for records relating to births, deaths, marriages, civil partnerships and adoptions in Republic of Ireland. It is part of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Registrar General is responsible for the management of the system of registration in Ireland, while the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the day to day delivery of the Civil Registration Service. Record-keeping started in 1864, and many records are available online. =Sri Lanka= The Registrar General's Department of Sri Lanka is responsible for registration of birth, marriages and deaths as well as and legal documents pertaining to properties (land and title registration). The post was created in 1864. =UK= England and Wales The post of Registrar General was created by the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836, and registration began in 1837. The Registrar General was soon given other responsibilities, such as the conduct of every census in England and Wales since 1841, and eventually came to be head of a primarily statistical organisation. In England and Wales, birth registration with the state began on 1 July 1837; however, only became compulsory in 1875. In 1970, with the creation of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys by merging the GRO and the Government Social Survey Department, the GRO became just one division of the new office, headed by a Deputy Registrar General. With the creation of the Office for National Statistics in 1996, the post of Registrar General was merged with that of Head of the Government Statistical Service, who became the National Statistician. Following the 2008 implementation of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the General Register Office became a part of the Identity & Passport Service ( HM Passport Office ‚Äì which in 2014 lost its executive agency status and became a division within the Home Office). Since 2020 the post has been held by Myrtle Lloyd, who is also Chief Operating Officer of HM Passport Office, and sits on the executive management board of the Home Office. Scotland The GROS was a non-ministerial directorate of the Scottish Government that administered the registration of births, deaths, marriages, divorces and adoptions in Scotland from 1854 to 2011. It was also responsible for the statutes relating to the formalities of marriage and conduct of civil marriage in Scotland. It administered the census of Scotland's population every ten years.About Us gro-scotland.gov.uk, accessed 10 October 2008 It also kept the Scottish National Health Service Central Register.NHS Central Register (NHSCR) gro-scotland.gov.uk, accessed 10 October 2008 On 1 April 2011 it was merged with the National Archives of Scotland to form National Records of Scotland.National Records of Scotland Scottish Government news release, accessed 18 April 2011 All the former department's functions continue as part of the new body.

Following absorption from the gut, indole is converted to 3-hydroxy indole (indoxyl or indican) in the liver, where it is again then conjugated with sulfuric acid or glucoronic acid through normal xenobiotic metabolism pathways.

The song, penned by African-American James A. Bland in 1879, is particularly well known as a bluegrass instrumental standard.  Overview  A minstrel show song set in the style of a spiritual, the song is apparently a parody of the spiritual \\"Golden Slippers\\", popularized after the American Civil War by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Today \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\" is often referred to simply as \\"Golden Slippers\\", further obscuring the original spiritual. The song's first stanza tells of the protagonist setting aside such fine clothes as golden slippers, a long-tailed coat and a white robe for a chariot ride in the morning (presumably to Heaven). This leads to the refrain: Oh, dem golden slippers! / Oh, dem golden slippers! / Golden slippers I'm gwine to wear, because dey look so neat; / Oh, dem golden slippers! / Oh, dem golden slippers! / Golden slippers Ise gwine to wear, / To walk de golden street. The second stanza describes the protagonist meeting up with other family members after his chariot ride. In the third, the protagonist tells children to prepare themselves for their own chariot ride.  Cultural references  * The song is well-known today as the unofficial theme song of the Philadelphia Mummers Parade. * The song, by then long in public domain, was used in early American television commercials for Golden Grahams cereal in the 1970s, with the refrain reworked in various ways around the phrase \\"Oh, those Golden Grahams\\".Timothy P.

He is noted for moving the royal capital from Srei Sonthor to Oudong, and for his cooperation with the Nguy·ªÖn Lords of Vietnam against the Siamese, which led to the Vietnamese annexation of the Mekong Delta, including the city of Prey Nokor‚Äîthe precursor of modern- day Ho Chi Minh City. In order to balance the influence of the Siamese forces, which had devastated the previous capital at Lovek during the reign of his father, Chey Chettha approached the Nguy·ªÖn lord for help. To cement the resulting alliance, Chey Chettha was married to Princess Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Ng·ªçc V·∫°n, a daughter of Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n, in 1618.Mai Th·ª•c, V∆∞∆°ng mi·ªán l∆∞u ƒë√†y: truy·ªán l·ªãch s·ª≠, Nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n VƒÉn h√≥a - th√¥ng tin, 2004, p.580; Gi√°o s∆∞ Ho√†ng Xu√¢n Vi·ªát, Nguy·ªÖn Minh Ti·∫øn hi·ªáu ƒë√≠nh, T√¨m hi·ªÉu l·ªãch s·ª≠ ch·ªØ qu·ªëc ng·ªØ, Ho Chi Minh City, C√¥ng ty VƒÉn h√≥a H∆∞∆°ng Trang, pp.31-33; Helen Jarvis, Cambodia, Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii.

Sleep temples were hospitals of sorts, healing a variety of ailments, perhaps many of them psychological in nature. The treatment involved chanting, placing the patient into a trance-like or hypnotic state, and analysing their dreams in order to determine treatment. Meditation, fasting, baths, and sacrifices to the patron deity or other spirits were often involved as well. Sleep temples also existed in the Middle East and Ancient Greece. In Greece, they were built in honor of Asclepios, the Greek god of medicine and were called Asclepieions. The Greek treatment was referred to as incubation and focused on prayers to Asclepios for healing. A similar Hebrew treatment was referred to as Kavanah and involved focusing on letters of the Hebrew alphabet spelling the name of their god.

The Leary rule which eliminated the defence was found unconstitutional in violation of both section 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Instead, intoxication can only be used as a defence where it is so extreme that it is akin to automatism or insanity. Background On May 30, 1989, Henri Daviault, a 73-year-old chronic alcoholic, was asked to get some alcohol for a friend of his wife. The woman was a semi-paralyzed 65-year-old and required a wheelchair. Daviault brought a 40oz of brandy to the woman's house around 6pm. She drank half a glass and then passed out. Daviault drank the rest of the bottle while she slept. Some time in the evening she went to the washroom and was accosted by Daviault who took her into the bedroom and sexually assaulted her. Daviault was arrested and charged for sexual assault. Daviault testified that prior to the event he had drunk over seven beers at a bar, and after drinking some brandy at the woman's house he has no recollection of what had happened until he woke up naked in the woman's bed. At trial, he argued that during his blackout he was in automatism-like state brought about by intoxication. An expert witness in pharmacology testified to the likelihood of the defence, and that having drunk as much as he did there was little chance he could have functioned normally or been aware of his actions. Based on the testimony of the pharmacologist, the trial judge found that Daviault was unable to form a general intent to commit the crime and therefore could be acquitted. The Quebec Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal ruling that intoxication to the point of automatism cannot negate the mens rea requirement for a general intent offence (i.e. offences where mens rea can be implied from the commission of the act). The issue before the Supreme Court was whether \\"a state of drunkenness which is so extreme that an accused is in a condition that closely resembles automatism or a disease of the mind as defined in s. 16 of the Criminal Code constitute a basis for defending a crime which requires not a specific but only a general intent?\\" The Court held, 6 to 3, that the absence of a defence for a general intent offence on the basis of intoxication akin to insanity or automatism violated section 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, and could not be saved under section 1. They overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial. Reasons of the court The majority was written by Cory J., with L'Heureux-Dub√©, McLachlin, and Iacobucci JJ. concurring. Lamer and La Forest JJ. each concurred separately with Cory's results. Cory considered the basis of the Court of Appeal's ruling. The lower court had applied the \\"Leary rule\\" from Leary v. The Queen [1978] which held that intoxication akin to insanity could not negate mens rea for \\"general intent\\" crimes such as sexual assault. The rationale was based on the legal presumption that \\"a person intends the natural consequences of his or her act.\\" For fear of having intoxication become an escape route for any general intent crime, the Leary rule addressed this by requiring the Crown to only prove that the accused intended to become intoxicated in substitute for establishing mens rea. =Section 7 and 11(d)= The Leary rule predated the Charter and so had not been considered in light of section 7. It is well established that a principle of fundamental justice was that the Crown must establish mens rea for all offences. However, Cory noted, the Leary rule made the act of drinking a potentially criminal act, removing any direct link to the actual prohibited conduct. Section 11(d) provides the right to be presumed innocent which requires the Crown to prove all elements of an offence. All mental elements must be \\"absolutely linked\\" to the offence in question, however, Cory found that the Leary rule failed to meet this requirement, as he was unable to equate the intent to become intoxicated with the involuntariness of committing an offence. Basically, the issue was that such offenders may not actually have the blameworthy intent for a legal finding of guilt and may, therefore, be punished based on intoxication, rather than for commission of a crime. =Section 1= The violation of section 7 and 11(d), Cory held, could not be saved under section 1. The objective of the rule was not sufficient to pass the first step of the Oakes test, as in fact, many jurisdictions had already abandoned the rule. The rule also failed every step of the proportionality test. The relationship between alcohol and crime was not substantial enough to rationally link the two. As well, the rule was less than minimally impairing as it provided exemption for all general intent crimes. =Remedy= Rather than just strike out the rule altogether Cory opted for a more flexible solution. He proposed that normal levels of intoxication should not be treated any different from sober individuals; however, those who were so intoxicated that it would be akin to automatism or insanity could rely on a defence of intoxication on the balance of probabilities. Cory speculated that this burden would likely violate section 11(d) however it would also likely be saved under section 1. For Daviault, Cory allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. Dissent A dissent was given by Sopinka J. with Gonthier and Major JJ. concurring. Aftermath Parliament under the first Chretien government reacted swiftly in response to the ruling, and within months passed Bill C-72 to amend the Criminal Code (1995, c. 32) in section 33.1 under the heading of Self-induced Intoxication. The preamble forms a severe denunciation of the impugned practice and an endorsement of the most vulnerable members of society. > 33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence referred to in subsection (3) > that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked the general > intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence, where the > accused departed markedly from the standard of care as described in > subsection (2). > (2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the > standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is > thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self- > induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of > consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily > interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another > person. > (3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act or any > other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other > interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity > of another person Since the amendment there remains a question as to whether this section could survive Charter scrutiny, since it effectively re-instates the Leary rule. In June 2020, the Court of Appeal for Ontario struck down s. 33.1, finding that it violated sections 7 and 11(d) the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.R. v.

Hoover Natural Preserve, which includes Waddell Marsh, is located at the mouth of Waddell Creek, a coastal freshwater marsh that is one of the rarest habitats on the Central Coast of California. This marsh is one of the few relatively undisturbed bodies of fresh water left along the West coast. The land is 23 acres of wetland habitat. It is part of the Rancho del Oso Big Basin Redwoods State Park, located approximately 65 miles south of San Francisco. The elevation in the park ranges from sea level to over 2,000 feet. The area was named after William W. Waddell, who established the last of his four sawmills there in 1868. The sawmill ran down after his death in 1875. All the boilers were left in the area; they are now completely surrounded by second-growth redwoods. Other trees found in the park are conifers, and oaks. Within the park there are different vegetation types to be seen, such as chaparral, redwood forests, and riparian habitats.  Animals  This habitat shelters many rare and endangered species such as the California red-legged frog, western pond turtle, tidewater goby, black rail, San Francisco garter snake, coho salmon (endangered) and steelhead (threatened). Hikers can also look out for feral pigs and red foxes around the park. The park is also home to more than 200 species of native and migratory birds such as ducks, sparrows, wrens, kingfishers, Swainson‚Äôs thrush, and warblers. In the park there are also many species of water birds, such as avocets, stilts, herons, and egrets. The most common mammals to be seen are black-tailed deer, chipmunks, squirrels and raccoons. Also, although not as regularly seen, the park is also home to skunks, bobcats, coyotes, and mountain lions. While there are not many fish in the streams, there are multiple species of reptiles and amphibians living in the streams and in the marsh. Park-goers are able to see the California newt, the Pacific tree frog, the western skink, the western toad and the alligator lizard. There is also a harbor seal rookery just south of the beach. Working with experts from other areas, the Waddell Creek Association hopes to educate the public about wetlands, their value and necessity.  Park usage  After William Waddell‚Äôs death, the main uses for the land became farming and ranching. In 1977, California State Parks took possession of the majority of the land, combining it with the Big Basin Redwoods State Park to make a large, continuous park. This new land connected from the redwoods all the way to the ocean. The park‚Äôs main uses now are hiking, hang gliding, and bird watching. At the beach within the preserve, available activities include windsurfing, kite surfing, surf fishing, surfing, and boogie boarding.  Skyline-to-the- Sea Trail  The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail threads its way through Big Basin Redwoods State Park along Waddell Creek to the ocean at Waddell Beach, a freshwater marsh adjacent called Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve.This trail has been considered by some to be one of the best overnight hikes in California. At the entrance to the preserve there is no admittance fee, and no parking fee. The park requires that hikers stay at a different camp every night, and reservations to camp must be made far in advanced.  History  The preserve is located in northern Santa Cruz County just one mile south of the San Mateo County line. It is named after Theodore J. Hoover, dean of engineering at Stanford University, and brother of President Hoover, whose family purchased Rancho del Oso in 1914, both for the purpose of building a family home and because of Theodore‚Äôs interest in the conservation of natural resources. The land was previously owned by the Ocean Shore Land and Investment Company. The company had intended to use the land to build a train from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. Hoover had owned the upper part of the valley, so when the plans for the train fell through, he bought the rest of it. Both Hoover, who died in 1955, and his wife who died in 1940, are buried in the valley.

It is an acid, an analogue of acetic acid, in which 2 of the 3 hydrogen atoms of the methyl group have been replaced by chlorine atoms. Like the other chloroacetic acids, it has various practical applications. The salts and esters of dichloroacetic acid are called dichloroacetates. Salts of DCA have been studied as potential drugs because they inhibit the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Although preliminary studies found that DCA can slow the growth of certain tumors in animal studies and in vitro studies, as of 2012 insufficient evidence supported the use of DCA for cancer treatment. Chemistry and occurrence The chemistry of dichloroacetic acid is typical for halogenated organic acids. It is a member of the chloroacetic acids family. The dichloroacetate ion is produced when the acid is mixed with water. As an acid with a pKa of 1.35, pure dichloroacetic acid is classed as a strong organic acid; it is very corrosive and extremely destructive to tissues of the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract via inhalation. DCA has been shown to occur in nature in at least one seaweed, Asparagopsis taxiformis. It is a trace product of the chlorination of drinking water and is produced by the metabolism of various chlorine-containing drugs or chemicals. DCA is typically prepared by the reduction of trichloroacetic acid (TCA). DCA is prepared from chloral hydrate also by the reaction with calcium carbonate and sodium cyanide in water followed by acidifying with hydrochloric acid. It can be also made by passing acetylene through solutions of hypochlorous acid. As a laboratory reagent, both DCA and TCA are used as precipitants to prompt macromolecules such as proteins to precipitate out of solution. Therapeutic uses =Topical chemoablation= Both DCA and TCA are used for cosmetic treatments (such as chemical peels and tattoo removal) and as topical medication for the chemoablation of warts, including genital warts. It can kill normal cells as well. =Lactic acidosis= A randomized controlled trial in children with congenital lactic acidosis found that while DCA was well tolerated, it was ineffective in improving clinical outcomes. A separate trial of DCA in children with MELAS (a syndrome of inadequate mitochondrial function, leading to lactic acidosis) was halted early, as all 15 of the children receiving DCA experienced significant nerve toxicity without any evidence of benefit from the medication. A randomized controlled trial of DCA in adults with lactic acidosis found that while DCA lowered blood lactate levels, it had no clinical benefit and did not improve hemodynamics or survival. Thus, while early case reports and pre-clinical data suggested that DCA might be effective for lactic acidosis, subsequent controlled trials have found no clinical benefit of DCA in this setting. In addition, clinical trial subjects were incapable of continuing on DCA as a study medication owing to progressive toxicities. =Cancer= In 2007 reports emerged in the press and via the Internet that Evangelos Michelakis and coworkers at the University of Alberta had found that dichloroacetic acid, or rather its sodium salt sodium dichloroacetate, reduced tumors in rats and killed cancer cells in vitro. A story in New Scientist sparked \\"unprecedented interest among readers\\", as it spoke of \\"a cheap and simple drug\\" that was \\"known to be relatively safe\\" and could kill most cancers. The original article did not have quotation marks around the word \\"safe\\". An accompanying editorial pointed out that no drug company would be interested in getting the compound approved as a cancer treatment because it is unpatentable. The magazine later published an article emphasizing the dangers involved, such as damage to nerves. The US Food and Drug Administration began enforcing a law that prohibits the sale of substances with the suggestion that they are cancer treatments unless they have been approved by the FDA. The American Cancer Society in 2012 stated that \\"available evidence does not support the use of DCA for cancer treatment at this time.\\" Physicians warned of potential problems if people attempt to try DCA outside a controlled clinical trial. One problem with attempting this is obtaining the chemical. One fraudster was sentenced to 33 months in prison for selling a white powder containing starch, but no DCA, to cancer sufferers. The only monitored in vivo dosage of five human patients suffering from glioblastoma with DCA was not designed to test its efficacy against their cancer. This study was rather to see whether it could be given at a specific dosage safely without causing side effects (e.g. neuropathy). All five patients were receiving other treatments during the study. Observations in vitro and of tumours extracted from those five patients suggest that DCA might act against cancer cells by depolarising abnormal mitochondria found in glioblastoma cancer cells ‚Äì allowing the mitochondria to induce apoptosis (cell death) of the malignant cells. In vitro work with DCA on neuroblastomas (which have fewer recognised mitochondrial abnormalities) showed activity against malignant, undifferentiated cells. A 2016 case report discusses and reviews the potential application of DCA in central nervous system malignancies. A 2018 study found that DCA could trigger a metabolic switch from glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to mitochondrial OXPHOS and increase reactive oxygen stress affecting tumor cells. These effects were not observed in non-tumor cells. =Neuropathy= Neuropathy has been a problem in some clinical trials with DCA causing them to be effectively halted, but a 2008 BJC review found that it has not occurred in DCA other trials. The mechanism of DCA induced neuropathy is not well understood. On the one hand in vitro work with nerves has suggested a mechanism for the neuropathic effect of DCA; with DCA showing a dose and exposure dependent demyelination of nerves (stripping of the nerve 'sheath'), which demyelination was partially reversible over time, following washout of DCA. On the other hand, the 2008 review in BJC states \\"This neurotoxicity resembled the pattern of length-dependent, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy without demyelination.\\" with regard to the 2006 study by Kaufman et al. =Heart failure= DCA has been investigated as a treatment for post-ischemic recovery. There is also evidence that DCA improves metabolism by NADH production stimulation, but may lead to a depletion of NADH in normoxia.

His employment at the Heilongjiang Daily, which followed the party line, and his decision to wear a red arm band indicating an alliance with Chairman Mao Zedong, allowed him access to scenes otherwise only described in written and verbal accounts. His 2003 book Red-Color News Soldier exhibits both the revolutionary ideals and many of the atrocities that occurred during the Cultural Revolution. The Heilongjiang Daily newspaper had a strict policy in accordance with a government dictate that only \\"positive\\" images could be published, which consisted mostly of smiling revolutionaries offering praise for Chairman Mao. The \\"negative\\" images, which depicted the atrocities of the time, were hidden beneath a floorboard in his house before he brought them to light at a photo exhibition in 1988. A private museum, dedicated to Li's life and work, was opened in 2017 in Sichuan Province as a part of the Jianchuan Museum Cluster. Early life Li was born to a poor family in Dalian, Liaoning. At the time of his birth the city was located in Kwantung Leased Territory, where Japan maintained the puppet regime, Manchukuo. His mother died when he was three, and his older brother, who was a member of the People's Liberation Army was killed during the Chinese Civil War. Li helped his father, who was a cook on a steamship and later as a farmer, until Li was 10 years old. Li rose to the top of his class despite starting school late. He later earned a spot at the Changchun Film School, where he acquired much of his photographic knowledge. In 1963, he briefly held a job at the Heilongjiang Daily, but the Socialist Education Movement intervened. Li ended up back in the countryside for nearly two years, living with peasants and studying the works of Chairman Mao.\\"Biography,\\" Red-color News Soldier Exhibition Website Cultural Revolution Li returned to Harbin just months before the outbreak of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the spring of 1966. A lack of photographic film, marauding Red Guards, and a political prohibition against photographing negative aspects of the revolution restricted what he was able to portray. He soon realized that only people wearing the red-colored arm band of the Red Guards could photograph without harassment. To achieve this, he founded his own small rebel group at the newspaper. Li then photographed horrific acts. His collection includes photos depicting the dehumanizing tactics used by the Red Guards to humiliate or degrade alleged counter- revolutionaries. Some images depict public displays of \\"denunciations,\\" where the hair of prominent individuals is shaved. Other images show people bearing \\"dunce\\" hats; people with black paint spread over their faces; others wearing signs around their necks with writing that criticizes their profession or names. Li also captured scenes of public executions of counter-revolutionaries who were never given a trial for their alleged crimes.The New York Times September 10, 2012 In September 1969, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, Li was once more sent back to the countryside. He was sent to the May 7th Cadre School in Liuhe, a labor camp where he and his wife, Zu Yingxia, spent two years performing hard labor. Li had taken meticulous care of the \\"negative\\" images he captured while at the newspaper, hiding them beneath a floorboard of his one-room apartment. The dry atmosphere and mild temperatures of Harbin aided the preservation of the photographic negatives. While he was sent away, Li entrusted a friend to care for the apartment, and instructed him to never reveal the secrets it contained. Li returned to the newspaper in 1972 as the head of the photography department, and later became a professor at Peking University in 1982. Red-Color News Soldier Li's book, Red-Color News Soldier, was published in 2003. The title is a literal translation of the Chinese characters written on the armband he wore during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Although, he says he never gave his alliance to Chairman Mao, wearing the arm band gave him unprecedented access to historic events, which have since shaped Chinese culture.Red-color News Soldier: A Chinese photographer's Odyssey through the Cultural Revolution (London, New York: Phaidon, 2003) ) The book covers the period from just before the Cultural Revolution in 1965 to just after in 1976. It is separated into five chronological sections: 1964‚Äì1966 titled \\"It is right to rebel\\"; 1966 titled \\"Bombard the Headquarters\\"; 1966‚Äì1968 titled \\"The Red Sun in our hearts\\"; 1968‚Äì1972 titled \\"Revolution is not a dinner party\\"; and 1972‚Äì1974 titled \\"Die Fighting.\\" China analyst John Gittings welcomed Li's book in his review, noting Li was a Red Guard as well as a photographer and did not deny that he also led \\"struggle sessions\\" against innocent victims. Gittings writes that Li's photos reflect a desire to record and understand, and that it was \\"unique\\" for a simple reason: \\"Although the post-Mao Chinese government has labelled the cultural revolution '10 years of chaos,' it still tries to suppress any real inquiry into the countless human tragedies it caused...\\" The book, which has not appeared in China, took many years to publish. Li's \\"negative\\" pictures (those that depicted the atrocities of the cultural revolution) were first revealed publicly in March 1988 at a Chinese Press Association's photography competition in Beijing. The show, entitled Let History Tell the Future consisted of twenty images from his collection, which were deemed \\"counterrevolutionary.\\" In December of that year, Li met Robert Pledge, a French-British photography editor who was director of Contact Press Images, an international photo agency based in New York City, who had come to Beijing. They agreed to work together on a book of Li's photos, but to wait until the political climate was right. Seven months later, in June 1989, the events of Tiananmen Square made worldwide headlines, and Li became determined to produce a book to show the world the images from the Cultural Revolution. Work on the book began in 1999. Since Pledge did not speak Chinese, and Li did not speak English, the two had to coordinate work through the use of translators--many of whom became integral parts of their relationship. Li sent over 30,000 brown envelopes to Pledge's office in New York City, each containing photographic negatives. A number of the images are self-portraits. This was the result of always returning to the paper with one extra frame on the film roll, a way of always being prepared to cover a breaking news event at the last minute. Li would \\"burn off\\" the last image with a photo of himself shortly before developing the film. Often the poses were humorous and playful. One such image of Li exposing his bare chest was published in the book. He said he was attempting to recreate the old expression of \\"baring one's chest in the face of adversity,\\" or in his case, communism.\\"With an Extra Frame,\\" New York Times September 10, 2012 During book tours Li made a point to speak of his love for China. He said while he disagrees with the government, he still loved his country and hoped democracy would perhaps prevail in the long- term future. He did not believe his images or the book should be considered anti-Chinese, rather a reminder of the painful past many countries endure during their evolution. Death Li died in June 2020.

It is a part of the municipality of Utrecht, and lies 6 km west of the inner city of this town. Before 2001 the villages De Meern, Vleuten and Haarzuilens formed a municipality called Vleuten-De Meern. On 1 January 2001, it was incorporated in the municipality of Utrecht. Since 1999 the number of inhabitants of De Meern has increased from about 11,000 to almost 22,000 in 2020. History De Meern lies in the region of a disappeared branch of the river Rhine. This river branch served as Northern border of the Roman Empire. On the river bank the Roman army built a walled camp, a so-called castellum. This happened in the first century after Christ. Also on other places in the Netherlands castella were built. The castellum in De Meern is unique because of the Museum Hoge Woerd with numerous archeological objects found in the soil of De Meern. This museum is housed in a rebuilt version of the castellum on the same place as the former real castellum. Within the museum a complete Roman ship can be viewed. This ship was excavated in 1997 when a new residential area in De Meern was prepared. It was found underground, at the bottom of the former river Rhine. After a many years lasting preservation process to prevent oxidation the ship was moved to the new built Muesum Hoge Woerd. In De Meern many objects from the Roman times and the middle ages are found, among which several ships, roads, pottery and currency. Most of these items (especially the big ones) have been put back into the ground for perfect preservation, since the riverclay prevents them from rotting. (It hardly lets oxygen through). Nevertheless many objects found in the soil of De Meern can be viewed in the local Museum Hoge Woerd. The village of De Meern and the Meernbrug in the 18th century A village 'De Meern' did not yet exist in the Roman times. In the 11th century there came farmers to the new 'polders' on the west of Utrecht. Round the year 1200 a dike called Meern was built. A bridge called Pons Maerne, in Dutch language: Meernbrug, was mentioned in a document from the year 1301. This bridge gave access to the dike Meern. Near the Meernbrug a chapel was founded. In the 15th century the village De Meern arose around this chapel, which in the 17th century was enlarged to a little church. In 1912 this building was broken off, and replaced by a church in Art Nouveau style. The present name of this church is Marekerk. (See photo) Nowadays, De Meern is part of the agglomeration of Utrecht. In 2020 the municipality of Utrecht has almost 360,000 inhabitants. The urban region surrounding and including the city of Utrecht has in 2020 about 675,000 inhabitants. For more information see the Dutch version of this article.

In 1999, the Topeka Capital-Journal named Lucius Oliver Allen, Jr. of Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, Kansas as the greatest Kansas high school basketball player of the 20th century. Allen was a prep All-American player under head coach Walt Shublom and was named consensus first-team all-state as a junior and senior as he led Wyandotte to back-to-back Class AA state championships in 1964 and '65. Prior to his National Basketball Association (NBA) career, he was a starter on two of coach John Wooden's UCLA NCAA Championship teams, in 1967 and 1968, playing alongside Lew Alcindor. These teams are considered by many to be the greatest in men's college basketball history. After being suspended for his senior year at UCLA for receiving a second citation for possessing a small quantity marijuana, Allen was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1st round (3rd pick) of the 1969 NBA draft and retired in 1979. As a member of the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks team, which also featured Alcindor, Allen earned an NBA championship ring. He also played with Alcindor, now known as Kareem Abdul- Jabbar, for two seasons, from 1975‚Äì77, in Los Angeles, but not winning a championship in either of those years. Allen was traded the following season to the Kansas City Kings, winning the division championship in 1979, and retired from basketball after that season.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest talents of his era in Portuguese football, the diminutive left winger's main asset was his ball control and dribbling skills. His career, highly troubled by injuries, was mainly spent at Benfica, where he also later worked as a manager. Prior to his physical problems, he was one of the best players at Euro 1984, helping Portugal to the semi-finals. Playing career Born in Barreiro, Set√∫bal District, Chalana began his football career at F.C. Barreirense, then moved to Lisbon neighbours S.L. Benfica in 1974, where he established himself the following eight years, scoring and assisting alike as he helped them conquer, amongst other accolades, five Primeira Liga and three Ta√ßa de Portugal trophies. Aged only 17 (fourth youngest ever), on 17 November 1976, Chalana won his first cap for Portugal, against Denmark for the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifiers ‚Äì at that age, he became Benfica's youngest player to score a goal at the Est√°dio da Luz. The peak of his career took place precisely on the international front, at UEFA Euro 1984, in France; there, the Little Genius was one of the team's leading figures, excelling in dribbling throughout the tournament, notably in the 2‚Äì3 semi-final loss against the hosts, setting up both goals for Rui Jord√£o. Moving to a club in that country after the tournament, FC Girondins de Bordeaux, Chalana failed to impress over three full seasons, mainly due to persistent injuries. In 1987 he returned to Benfica, never being able to reproduce his previous form; his last international appearance was a friendly with Sweden on 12 November 1988, which finished with a goalless draw. Chalana wrapped his career at 33, with one season apiece with Lisbon-based sides C.F. Os Belenenses and C.F. Estrela da Amadora, the latter in the second division. Coaching career In 1999‚Äì2000, Chalana was at the helm of Benfica's juniors, winning the national championship. Four years later he had his first coaching experience, assisting at modest F.C. Pa√ßos de Ferreira in an eventual top-flight relegation as 17th. For the following years, Chalana served as assistant to several coaches at Benfica. However, in March 2008 he replaced Jos√© Antonio Camacho after the Spaniard was dismissed. In 2002, he had already had a one-game spell as interim, filling in for the dismissed Jesualdo Ferreira ‚Äì days before precisely Camacho arrived; in that match he placed winger Miguel as a right back, where he ultimately gained worldwide recognition. After one more season as assistant, now to Quique S√°nchez Flores, Chalana returned to coaching the junior side. Personal life Other than his main nickname, Chalana was also dubbed Ast√©rix, Chalanix (as his moustache resembled the comic character) and Cyrano de Bergerac (because of his nose).

Sewer alligator stories date back to the late 1920s and early 1930s; in most instances they are part of contemporary legend. They are based upon reports of alligator sightings in rather unorthodox locations, in particular New York City. The New York Times reports the city rescues several alligators per year, some directly from homes where they are kept as illegal pets (which can be legally ordered online in other states and are legal to mail when small), and some from outside (where they can attract considerable attention) though mostly above-ground. Though escapees and former pets may survive for a short time in New York sewers, longer-term survival is not possible due to low temperatures and the bacteria in human faeces. Sewer maintenance crews have confirmed there is no underground population. A similar story from 1851 involves feral pigs in the sewers of Hampstead, London. Legend Following the reports of sewer alligators in the 1930s, the story has built up over the decades and become more of a contemporary legend. Many have even questioned how accurate the original stories are, and some have even suggested they are fictions created by Teddy May, who was the Commissioner of Sewers at the time.Live Science Interviews with him were the basis of the first published accounts of sewer alligators. However, the story of the \\"sewer gator\\" in New York City is well known and various versions have been told. =Louisiana or Florida to New York City= As late as the middle of the 20th century, souvenir shops in Florida sold live baby alligators (in small fish tanks) as novelty souvenirs. Tourists from New York City would buy a baby alligator and try to raise it as a pet. When the alligator grew too large for comfort, the family would proceed to flush the reptile down the toilet.Emery, David. \\"Alligators in the Sewers of New York: Is it true that giant albino alligators inhabit the sewers of New York City?\\" ThoughtCo.com (May 5, 2017). What happens next varies. The most common story is that the alligators survive and reside within the sewer and reproduce, feeding on rats and garbage, growing to huge sizes and striking fear into sewer workers. In Robert Daley's book The World Beneath the City (1959) he comments that one night a sewer worker in New York City was shocked to find a large albino alligator swimming toward him. Weeks of hunting followed. The Journal of American Folklore has this to say on the subject: An additional reference to the sewer alligator exists in Thomas Pynchon's first novel, V.Pynchon, Thomas. Chapter Five: \\"In Which Stencil Nearly Goes West with an Alligator,\\" V (J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1963), p. 43. It fictionalizes the account, stating Macy's was selling them for a time for 50 cents. Eventually the children became bored with the pets, setting them loose in the streets as well as flushing them into the sewers. Rather than poison, shotguns were used as the remedy. Benny Profane, one of the main characters in the book, continues to hunt them as a full-time job until the population is reduced. A 1973 children's book, The Great Escape: Or, The Sewer Story by Peter Lippman anthropomorphizes these alligators and has them dress up in disguise as humans and charter an airplane to fly them home to the Florida swamps. =Versions including albinos and mutants= An albino alligator at the California Academy of Sciences Some versions go further to suggest that, after the alligator was disposed of at such a young age, it would live the majority of its life in an environment not exposed to sunlight, and thus it would apparently in time lose its eyesight and the pigment in its hide and that the reptile would grow to be blind and completely albino (pure white in color with red or pink eyes). Another reason why an albino alligator would retreat to an underground sewer is because of its vulnerability to the sun in the wild; as there is no dark pigment in the creature's skin, it has no protection from the sun, which makes it very hard for it to survive in the wild.Suggestions that the alligators may have been albino Some people even spoke of mutant alligators living in the sewers which have been exposed to many different types of toxic chemical waste which altered them, making them deformed and sometimes even larger and with strange colouring. A gigantic mutant alligator based on these myths appears in the 1980 film of the same name.Alligator film Albino alligators feature in the Thomas Pynchon novel V. =Contemporary accounts= One 1927 account describes an experience of a Pittsburgh Bureau of Highways and Sewers employee who was assigned the task of clearing out a section of sewer pipe on Royal Street in the Northside Section of the city. The account reads, \\"[He] removed the manhole cover and began to clear an obstruction when he realized that a set of 'evil-looking eyes' was staring at him.\\" He then removed a three-foot alligator and took it home with him. There are other numerous recent media accounts of alligators occupying storm drains and sewer pipes, all from states in the southern US. In Paris, France, a Nile crocodile was captured by firefighters in the sewers below the Pont Neuf bridge on March 7, 1984.French news report The crocodile, named Elenore,Video of Eleanor currently lives at the Aquarium in Vannes.Alligators in NY sewersEleanor the crocodile A baby alligator was caught in 2010 by the NYPD in the sewers in Queens.Time Magazine However, it is unlikely that a fully grown adult would survive for long in New York, due to the cold winter temperatures.Live Science Alligators have been sighted in the drains and sewers of Florida as recently as 2017, due to many of these waste outlets backing out onto the swamps.9 ft alligator pulled from sewer During storm surges and in the colder winter months, alligators sometimes shelter in convenient drains and hunt for rats to supplement their diet.

History According to The Jewish Daily Forward, its use as an amulet originates in 18th century Eastern Europe. Chai as a symbol goes back to medieval Spain. Letters as symbols in Jewish culture go back to the earliest Jewish roots, the Talmud states that the world was created from Hebrew letters which form verses of the Torah. In medieval Kabbalah, Chai is the lowest (closest to the physical plane) emanation of God.Pelaia, Ariela. \\"What Does the Chai Symbol Signify for Jews?\\" ThoughtCo. (accessed March 9, 2018). According to 16th century Greek rabbi Shlomo Hacohen Soloniki, in his commentary on the Zohar, Chai as a symbol has its linkage in the Kabbalah texts to God's attribute of 'Ratzon', or motivation, will, muse.Sheat Ratzon al ha-Zohar 35 The Jewish commentaries give an especially long treatment to certain verses in the Torah with the word as their central theme. Three examples are Leviticus 18:5 'Chai Bahem', 'and you shall live by [this faith]' (as opposed to just doing it), this is part of the section dealing with the legacy of Moses Our Teacher following his death. Deuteronomy 30:15 \\"Verily, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, in that I command thee this day to love the thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live.\\" There is nary an ancient Jewish commentator who does not comment on that verse. The Shema prayer as well speaks of the importance of Chai, to live and walk in the Jewish cultural lifestyle. Two common Jewish names used since Talmudic times, are based on this symbol, Chaya feminine, Chayim masculine. The Jewish toast (on alcoholic beverages such as wine) is l'chaim, 'to life'. On a spiritual (and historical) level, chai stands for being alive in front of God as opposed to being (spiritually) dead. This is derived from Tenach, Deuteronomy 30:19-20 where (the) heaven(s) and the earth are depicted as a witness for the fact that there is life and death, blessing and curse and that you (therefore) should choose Life (God), in order to live. Linguistics The word is made up of two letters of the Hebrew alphabet - Chet () and Yod (), forming the word \\"chai\\", meaning \\"alive\\", or \\"living\\". The most common spelling in Latin script is \\"Chai\\", but the word is occasionally also spelled \\"Hai\\". The usual modern pronunciation of this word is , while a transcription of the Biblical and Mishnaic pronunciation would have likely been (with a pharyngeal consonant). In Hebrew, the related word chaya () means \\"living thing\\" or \\"animal\\", and is derived from the Hebrew word chai (), meaning \\"life\\". Numerology There have been various mystical numerological speculations about the fact that, according to the system of gematria, the letters of chai add up to 18 (see \\"Lamedvavniks\\" etc.). For this reason, 18 is a spiritual number in Judaism, and many Jews give gifts of money in multiples of 18 as a result. In Jewish culture Maccabia medals with Chai symbol The Chai symbol can be worn by Jews as a medallion around the neck, similarly to other Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David and the Hamsa. Jews often give gifts and donations in multiples of 18, which is called \\"giving chai\\". Mailings from Jewish charities usually suggest the amounts to give in multiples of chai (18, 36, 54 dollars, etc.) rather than the usual multiples of 25. It appears in the slogan \\"!\\" (, \\"The people of Israel lives!\\"). It is heard in a BBC recording from April 20, 1945 of Jewish survivors of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp five days after their liberation. This was the first Sabbath ceremony openly conducted on German soil since the beginning of the war. With people still dying around them, the survivors sang what would become the Israeli national anthem, \\"Hatikvah\\".

It was founded in 1882 by John James Fenwick in Newcastle upon Tyne, and today consists of nine branches. As of 2019, the chain is still owned by members of the Fenwick family. The company was chaired by Mark Fenwick until 2017. In 2012, the company was reported to be valued at ¬£452million. History Fenwick store in Market Street, Leicester The store's founder, John James Fenwick, was born in Richmond, North Yorkshire in 1846. The original store opened in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1882 and sold only mantles, silk goods, dresses, fabrics and trimmings and did not broaden into a department store until John's eldest son Fred Fenwick joined the business in 1890. Fred had trained in retail in Paris and is said to have been inspired by Le Bon March√©, which is regarded as one of the first ever department stores. Fenwick has since expanded its operations. In 1888, it opened a store in Sunderland, but it closed within the year. In 1891, it opened a branch in Bond Street, London.Anne Pimlott Baker, ‚ÄòFenwick family (per. 1882‚Äì1979)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 April 2011 This store was later doubled in size in 1980. The company bought the Joseph Johnson store in Leicester in 1962, which was subsequently rebranded as Fenwick. Fenwick was an anchor department store for the 1976 opening of Brent Cross Shopping Centre in London, which was the first large out-of-town shopping centre in the UK. A further store was opened in Oxford on the site of the F Cape & Co department store in 1978. Outlets in Windsor and York followed in 1980 and 1984 respectively, with a limited range of departments, specialising in clothing, fashion accessories and cosmetics. The Ricemans store in Canterbury was acquired in 1986, and rebranded Fenwick in 2003. The Tunbridge Wells store opened in 1992 as part of the Royal Victoria Place development. In 2001, Fenwick acquired the Bentalls group of department stores for ¬£70.8 million, with stores in Kingston upon Thames, Worthing, Ealing, Bracknell, Tonbridge and Lakeside. The Lakeside store was closed, and three branches (Worthing, Ealing and Tonbridge) were subsequently sold to J E Beale, with Fenwick retaining only the stores in Kingston upon Thames and Bracknell. In 2007, Fenwick purchased Williams & Griffin, an independent department store in Colchester, Essex; this continued to trade under the Williams & Griffin name until a 2016 refurbishment, after which it adopted the Fenwick identity. On 5 January 2017, Mark Fenwick announced that the historic Leicester store was to close. The store closed in June 2017. In April 2017, Fenwick announced plans to close their Windsor store. The store closed in August 2017. Bentalls in Bracknell closed in 2017 with the opening of a new Fenwick store in The Lexicon Shopping Center, located in the same city. Current operations Main entrance to the Newcastle store on Northumberland Street. Fenwick has its headquarters at the original Fenwick department store in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. The company operates nine outlets across England (May 2020): Newcastle upon Tyne, Bond Street in London, Bracknell, Brent Cross Shopping Centre in London, Canterbury, Colchester, Kingston upon Thames, Royal Tunbridge Wells and York.https://www.fenwick.co.uk/store- locator/ =Fenwick Newcastle= The original store in the group occupies a large site in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. The store has expanded many times since its foundation in 1882 and now consists of several interconnected buildings with entrances onto Northumberland Street, Eldon Square, Monument Metro Station and Blackett Street. Fenwick offers a wide range of goods and services with a focus on premium and luxury products. It is one of few department stores in the UK to retain a food hall. This was refurbished in 2015. The store is known locally for its extravagant Christmas window displays, filled with detailed sets and sophisticated moving figures, which have appeared since 1971. Affectionate and nostalgic portrayals of the Fenwick Newcastle store appear in three historical novels by the British writer Roger Harvey: Room for Love (2015), Maiden Voyage (2017) and Room for Us (2020).

An alternate name, Ostentoria, has also been proposed for a grouping of the Carnivora and Pholidota. The last common ancestor of extant Ferae is supposed to have diversified ca. 78.9 million years ago. Several extinct orders, relatives of the Pholidota, such as Creodonts, are members of Ferae as well.  Phylogeny of extant taxa  = Position of pangolins = Pangolins were long thought to be the closest relatives of Xenarthra (armadillos, anteaters, and sloths), contributing to the polyphyletic group of Edentata. Research based on immunodiffusion technique and comparison of protein and DNA sequences revealed the close relationships between pangolins and carnivorans. Living pangolins and carnivorans also share few unusual derived morphological and anatomical traits, such as the ossified tentorium cerebelli and the fusion of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist. = Sister groups to Ferae = According to recent studies (reflected in the diagram below), the closest relatives of Ferae are Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and rhinos) and Cetartiodactyla (which combines Artiodactyla‚Äîcamels, pigs, ruminants and hippos‚Äîwith Cetacea‚Äîwhales and dolphins). (Advance Access; published online 7 September 2011) An alternate phylogeny (less supported) holds that the closest relatives to the Ferae are the Perissodactyla and Chiroptera (bats), not Cetartiodactyla. Ferae together with Perissodactyla has been called Zooamata. Ferae, Perissodactyla, and Chiroptera together has been called Pegasoferae.  Fossil members  = Position of Creodonta = While there has been strong support in the inclusion of creodonts into Ferae, they were usually recovered as sister taxon to Carnivoramorpha (carnivorans and their stem-relatives). The phylogenetic analysis of hundreds of morphological characters of Paleocene placentals found instead that creodonts might be the sister group to Pholidotamorpha (pangolins and their stem-relatives). = Possible members = After Halliday et al. (2015) various enigmatic Palaeocene mammals have been found to be possible members to Ferae, like members of suboders Pantodonta and Taeniodonta, and families Didelphodontidae, Nyctitheriidae, Oxyclaenidae, Palaeoryctidae, Pantolestidae, Pentacodontidae, Periptychidae, Triisodontidae and Wyolestidae. In addition various supposedly \\"hoofed mammals\\" like the mesonychians and arctocyonids (usually considered as stem-artiodactyls) also belong to the group. In addition, Mesonychians might be the sister group to carnivoramorphs, while arctocyonids are polyphyletic with Arctocyon and Loxolophus sister to pantodonts and periptychids, Goniacodon and Eoconodon sister to the Carnivoramorpha-Mesonychia clade, most other genera allied with creodonts and palaeoryctidans, and Protungulatum not a placental mammal. This enlarged Ferae was also found to be the sister group to Chiroptera.

Based on Grammy- winner Harry Connick, Jr.‚Äôs original song, \\"The Happy Elf\\". Production on the special is by Film Roman, an IDT Entertainment company, the same animation company known for producing The Simpsons. Plot Eubie the Elf (Rob Paulsen) loves working in Santa Claus' workshop up at the North Pole, despite the other elves' complaints about being annoyed by his overly happy personality. One Christmas Eve morning, Eubie's boss, Norbert, assigns him to checking the naughty and nice lists. However, while checking the lists, Eubie discovers that every child in the town of Bluesville is naughty. So, he decides to go to Bluesville and spread Christmas cheer. Bluesville is a dark miserable town at the bottom of a very deep valley, completely surrounded by tall dark cliffs. There, the townspeople feel the warmth of the sun only once a day. They never smile, they don't know how to tell a joke properly, most of them work at the What Factory, where all the world's question marks are made, and at the Bluesville school, recess only lasts one minute. Eubie tries to brighten everyone's spirits, but his overly good mood frightens them. Eubie talks to the mayor about what is wrong with Bluesville and if there's anything about Bluesville that makes him feel proud. The mayor replies that Bluesville is the world's largest manufacturer of un-burnable coal, which children enjoy throwing at people and at each other. The mayor then makes a deal with Eubie. If he can find another use for the coal, he'll put a Christmas tree up in the town square. Eubie's first plan on getting the kids to help him make Bluesville a happier place is having them gather on a busy street and start a pie fight, but that only makes all the people angry. To search for more help, Molly (Mae Whitman), a naughty 10-year-old girl, takes Eubie to downtown Bluesville, the most miserable part of Bluesville, for a meeting of a group called S.L.O.B. (Smile League Of Bluesville), which only has one member of its group. While there, Molly and Eubie meets up with Curtis (Candi Milo), who is there because he brought along his foreign friend, Oreg, who doesn't speak English, but is happy to be there. Molly soon decides that Eubie's plans are hopeless, and tells him to just take all his big ideas home. At the mention of that, Eubie gets another idea, and is about to implement it when the lights in the room go off and Eubie is taken back to the North Pole. In his bid to get Bluesville off the naughty list, Eubie violated several rules in one day. As punishment, Santa had Eubie turn in his magic hat, which, at the North Pole, meant his Christmas happiness and powers were taken away. When Gilda (Carol Kane) hears this, she motivates Eubie to go back to Bluesville to finish his job and gives him her hat to restore his powers and happiness. He then returns to Bluesville and explains his plan to the children. That night, they give the mayor of Bluesville a bottle of anti-snore medicine in his sleep, while Eubie spends the night polishing all the cliffs surrounding Bluesville with a jar of super-duper un-burnable coal polish. While he is doing this, Derek notices Gilda doesn't have her hat on, he soon figures out what is going on and, trying to follow the North Pole rules, he notifies one of the higher-ups. After polishing the cliffs, Eubie is taken back to the North Pole again where he and Gilda are put on punishment and are sentenced to clean up the toy factory, with both their hats taken away. Derek, now alone at the Christmas party, is sad and mad with himself for betraying his friends, and confesses to what he did to Eubie and Gilda. They forgive him, but it only makes him feel worse about himself, considering what he did to them. While wondering what he can do to make it up to them, they have him do the one thing Eubie intended to do to finish making Bluesville a happier place. When the sun shines over Bluesville again, it reflects off the polished coal, lighting up the town and making everyone happy. At the What Factory, the machine now makes different colored exclamation points of all shapes and sizes, delighting the workers. At the school, when recess starts, the bell has an elf's shoe placed over it, which means the kids can play longer. Molly comes out of the school where Derek meets her. He tells her to find the mayor and give her the jar of coal polish Eubie used to polish the cliffs, and a piece of coal that was squeezed into a diamond and to tell her that Eubie was sorry he couldn't be there. Molly happily goes to find the mayor, but stays for a while to allow Curtis to tell a joke that's actually funny, thanks to the joke book Derek gave him. Molly finds the mayor and shows him the items, which meant that there was indeed another use for the coal. He then puts up a Christmas tree in the town square and everybody celebrates, thanks to Eubie. That Christmas, Santa decides to make Eubie, Gilda, and Derek his sleigh crew that year for bringing joy to Bluesville, which has soon changed its name to Joyville.

AADL was first developed in the field of avionics, and was known formerly as the Avionics Architecture Description Language.Detailed presentation of AADL The Architecture Analysis & Design Language is derived from MetaH, an architecture description language made by the Advanced Technology Center of Honeywell. AADL is used to model the software and hardware architecture of an embedded, real-time system. Due to its emphasis on the embedded domain, AADL contains constructs for modeling both software and hardware components (with the hardware components named \\"execution platform\\" components within the standard). This architecture model can then be used either as a design documentation, for analyses (such as schedulability and flow control) or for code generation (of the software portion), like UML.Bordin, M., Comar, C., Falis, E., Gasperoni, F., Moy, Y., Richa, E., & Hugues, J. (2014). System to software integrity: A case study.  AADL eco-system  AADL is defined by a core language that defines a single notation for both system and software aspects. Having a single model ease the analysis tools by having only one single representation of the system. The language specifies system-specific characteristics using properties. The language can be extended with the following methods: * user-defined properties: user can extend the set of applicable properties and add their own to specify their own requirements * language annexes: the core language is enhanced by annex languages that enrich the architecture description. For now, the following annexes have been defined. ** Behavior annex: add components behavior with state machines ** Error-model annex: specifies fault and propagation concerns ** ARINC653 annex: defines modelling patterns for modelling avionics system ** Data-Model annex: describes the modelling of specific data constraint with AADL AADL Tools AADL is supported by a wide range of tools: * OSATE that includes a modeling platform, a graphical viewer and a constraint query languages * Ocarina, an AADL toolchain for generating code from models * TASTE toolchain supported by the European Space Agency A complete list of the tool set can be found on the AADL public wiki  Related Projects  AADL has been used for the following research projects: * AVSI/SAVI: an initiative that leverages AADL (among other languages) to perform virtual integration of aerospace and defense systems * META: a DARPA project for improving software engineering methods * PARSEC: a French initiative to validate and implement avionics systems from architecture models * TASTE: a platform for designing safety-critical systems from models A complete list of the past and current projects/initiatives can be found on the AADL public wiki References External links * AADL.info * AADL public wiki * AADL tools * AADL at Axlog * AADL at Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des T√©l√©communications de Paris (ENST) * AADL performance analysis with Cheddar, Univ. of Brest (real time scheduling and queueing system analysis) * Industrial project support using Stood for AADL * AADL In Practice, a book dedicated to the use of the languages and its related modeling tools Category:Systems architecture Category:Architecture description language Category:Software modeling language Category:Modeling languages ","title":"Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language"},{"id":"2998008","text":"Enrich may refer to: * A process in Education often referring to activities outside the formal curriculum, or an extra program for the most-able * The process of adding nutrients to cereals or grain, see food fortification * The process of adding sugar to grape must during winemaking in order to achieve a higher alcohol content of the wine, more commonly referred to as chaptalization * Behavioral enrichment, the practice of providing animals under managed care with stimuli such as natural and artificial objects * Environmental enrichment, how the brain is affected by the stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings * The process of enhancing breathing gas for scuba diving (e.g. in Enriched Air Nitrox). * Job enrichment, improving work processes and environments so they are more satisfying for employees * Nuclear enrichment, the process of increasing the Uranium-235 content of nuclear fuel in preparation for nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons ** The United States Enrichment Corporation, a manufacturer of enriched uranium * Unjust enrichment, in civil law, a term for someone who has benefitted another party with the expectation of compensation, but who has not been justly compensated * The Enrichment Center Percussion Ensemble from the Enrichment Centre in Winston-Salem NC * The Living Enrichment Center, a church in Portland, Oregon * The notion of enriched category in mathematics * The analysis of gene product annotations using GO Term Enrichment in biology * The use of an enrichment culture, to select for the growth of a particular microorganism * The paradox of enrichment, a principal of ecology where an abundance of prey tends to destabilize the predator population * Enrichment factor, used to describe bodies of mineral ore ","title":"Enrichment"},{"id":"2998033","text":"West Hampstead Thameslink is a National Rail station on the Midland Main Line and is served by Thameslink trains as part of the Thameslink route between Kentish Town and Cricklewood.

During his time with the Shadows he appeared with Cliff Richard in the musical film Summer Holiday. Locking also toured as a session player with numerous artist's including rock stars Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and Joe Brown, as well as Conway Twitty and Brenda Lee. Biography Early life and music career Locking was born on 22 December 1938 in Bedworth, Warwickshire, England and attended St. Anne's School, Spittlegate, and the at Huntingtower Road School. After leaving school he worked as a fireman and trinee train driver whilst he shovelled coal for British Railways. He began playing double bass in several bands, and was a member of The Harmonica Vagabonds, subsequently called The Vagabonds Skiffle Group, he performed formed regularly at the The 2i's Coffee Bar in Soho, London, where he was asked to tour with Terry Dene and notably with fellow Grantham-based rocker Vince Eager, whom he had performed with in The Vagabonds. The Wildcats He switched to bass guitar, later joining The Wildcats, a backing group for the rock and roll singer Marty Wilde. A fellow Wildcat was the drummer and future member of The Shadows, Brian Bennett. Locking also played several other instruments including harmonica and clarinet (nicknamed the \\"licorice stick\\", which earned Locking the nickname \\"Licorice\\"). Vince Eager (previously Roy Taylor) came up with the nickname \\"Licorice\\" when introducing Locking on stage when he played in skiffle band The Vagabonds in Ingoldmells in 1956. When Marty Wilde parted company from The Wildcats, they changed their name to \\"the Krew Kats\\" and recorded instrumentals with modest success. Bennett then left to join the Shadows. The Shadows In April 1962, whilst having just started performing with Adam Faith, at Bennett's suggestion, Locking was himself invited to join The Shadows to replace the departing bassist Jet Harris. Stylistically, Locking had a solid \\"less is more\\" approach, which was the obverse of Harris's adventurous hard-driving style. The Shadows' sound changed as a result. Locking played on some of their best known tracks, including \\"Dance On\\", \\"Foot Tapper\\" and \\"Atlantis\\". He also played the harmonica in live shows and on his signature album track, \\"Dakota\\". He appeared in the 1963 Cliff Richard film, Summer Holiday. After being in the Shadows for only eighteen months, Locking left to pursue his activities with the Jehovah's Witnesses. He remained on the music scene at a more compatible pace and was invited to play double bass on Donovan's first recording session. He briefly played with the Shadows again five years later while his successor John Rostill was in hospital. In later life Locking was a regular guest playing at Shadows guitar clubs across the UK and abroad. He was also frequently invited to perform with various Shadows- style bands and was fundamental to honouring their legacy in such countries as France and Germany He reprised his role in the Wildcats at Marty Wilde's 50th Anniversary Concert, where he also appeared on stage with all the surviving Shadows members. Death Brian Locking suffered from Bell's palsy, and he was registered blind. He died in a hospice in North Wales on 8 October 2020 aged 81, after having being diagnosed with a tumour on the bladder.

Life From 1867, Jellinek studied law, history of art and philosophy at the University of Vienna. He also studied philosophy, history and law in Heidelberg and Leipzig up until 1872. He was the son of Adolf Jellinek, a famous preacher in Vienna's Jewish community. In 1872 he completed his Dr. phil. thesis in Leipzig (The Socio-Ethical Meaning of Justice, Injustice and Punishment) and in 1874 also his Dr. jur. in Vienna. In 1879 he qualified as a professor at the University of Vienna. Jellinek was later visiting professor of legal philosophy in Vienna, in 1881 he was named a member of the commission for state exams and one year later he published his seminal work, The Theory of the Unifications of States (1882). In 1883 he was given the prestigious title of Professor of Public Law at the University of Vienna. In 1889 he was duly given a professorship in Basel and left the academic service of Austria- Hungary. From 1891 he was Ordinarius for general Public Law and International Law at the University of Heidelberg. In 1900 he compiled his main work, General Theory of the State. He was married to Camilla Jellinek, n√©e Wertheim (1860‚Äì1940), who was persuaded to join the Women's Movement by Marianne Weber in 1900 and became famous there especially for her work with providing women with legal aid and the production of draft reforms of the criminal law. The couple had six children, born between 1884 and 1896, of which just four survived childhoodamong them son Walter, who also became a law professor and edited a final, posthumous edition of General Theory of the State; daughter Dora, who survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp; and youngest son, Otto, who died in 1943 as a result of abuse at the hands of the Gestapo. Jellinek is best known for his essay The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1895), which argues for a universal theory of rights, as opposed to the culturally and nationally specific arguments then in vogue (particularly that of √âmile Boutmy). Jellinek argued that the French Revolution, which was the focal point of 19th-century political theory, should not be thought of as arising from a purely French tradition (namely the tradition stemming from Jean-Jacques Rousseau) but as a close analogue of revolutionary movements and ideas in England and the United States.  Career  His grave in Heidelberg Jellinek studied law in 1867 in Vienna at the Alma Mater Rudolphina along with art history and philosophy. In addition he continued studies until 1872 in philosophy, history and law at the Heidelberg University in Heidelberg and at the Alma Mater Lipsiensis. Jellinek attended Leipzig in 1872 writing a dissertation on The Worldviews of Leibnitz and Schopenhauer and received his Dr. phil. In 1874, he also received the Dr. jur. Jellinek followed this in 1879 with his Habilitation at the University of Vienna. Jellinek then became a lecturer in the philosophy of law in Vienna, and in 1881 he was appointed a member of the State Examination Commission. In the following year, Jellinek published one of his seminal works titled 'The doctrine of Federated States' (1882). In 1883 he was appointed extraordinary professor of Constitutional Law in Vienna. In 1889 he became a full professor in Basel and retired from his academic position in Austria-Hungary. In 1891 Jellinek became a Professor of law at the University of Heidelberg and wrote, in 1900, his magnum opus, the General Theory of State. In 1907 he became the first Jewish Rector of Heidelberg University.  Writings  The majority of Jellinek's writings remain untranslated out of the original German language. * Die Weltanschauungen Leibnitz‚Äô und Schopenhauer‚Äôs: Ihre Gr√ºnde und ihre Berechtigung.

T. Alderman School is a Science School in southeastern Calgary in the province of Alberta, Canada. It is located in the community of Maple Ridge. History The school is named after Robert Thomas Alderman. Alderman was an influential person who brought junior high schools to Calgary in late 1940. This school has been around since 1966 and is situated beside the Willow Park recreation center (whose outdoor facilities are often used for physical education by the school), and Maple Ridge Elementary School. The main colours of this school are blue, gray, and white. The school logo was a hippopotamus for a number of years, then it was a snake. The school logo now is a Raven, with a new logo of a Raven created by a student. The school's motto is \\"Together We Make A Difference\\"  Science As a science school, there are many expectations of students that relate to science. One expectation is that each student enters a project in the science fair every year. See CBE guidelines for further science school expectations. Athletics The school's team is the RTA Ravens. The school has cross-country, track and field, badminton, volleyball, soccer, and basketball teams. In the annual Miracle Mile, all students run a course of roughly a kilometer around the fields, nearby community center, and Maple Ridge Elementary. The NSA program transferred to RTA in 2011. Students enrolled in the national sports academy at Fairview will either have to go to RTA or go into a different program at Fairview, such as TLC, French Immersion or late French. Campus The school has a design shared by two other Calgary schools. The architecture features slanted roofs and columns on the windows. The school overall has about 70 rooms. It has a band room, an industrial arts room, and a home economics room. Alumni One of the alumni is astronaut Robert Thirsk. Another, is Kaleb Toth of the Calgary Roughnecks professional lacrosse team. He holds many track and field records for the school. References External links *R. T.

Usually this occurs due to the death or termination of the former owner's life estate, but this can also occur due to a specific notation in a trust passing ownership from one person to another. For example, if the owner of property makes a grant of that property \\"to John for life, and then to Jane,\\" Jane is entitled to a future interest, called a remainder, and is termed a remainderman. Another example is say Mary leaves her books to Mark her son, and if he doesn't want them he leaves them to his daughter Ruth, who also doesn't want them and leaves to Mary's brother Michael who is the remainderman. Under the required minimum distribution rules for retirement accounts, the remaindermen beneficiaries must be included in the list of beneficiaries provided to the IRA custodian or plan trustee, for purposes of the trust meeting the requirements to be considered ‚Äòqualified‚Äô.

The bridge was located between Bosher Dam and Williams Island Dam just west of the 7 miles of rapids and falls which constitute the fall line of the James River at Richmond, Virginia. Built as a toll bridge in 1911, it was named for the nearby Westham Station of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway near the north end. Also nearby at the north end were the remains of the James River and Kanawha Canal. The privately held company which financed the bridge, Southampton Bridge Corporation, was headed by developer George Craghead Gregory, who also had plans to extend a streetcar line from an existing line at Westhampton Park (now the University of Richmond) to the suburban community of Bon Air. Originally developed as a popular resort, Bon Air had become a bedroom community of Richmond. Between the James River and Bon Air, Gregory controlled large land areas along the proposed rail line which he hoped to develop. However, despite his plans, aside from grading of right-of-way, Gregory's planned streetcar line did not materialize. After 1933, State Route 147 was routed across the Westham Bridge. It connected River Road and Westham Parkway in Henrico with Southampton Road and the new Huguenot Road in Chesterfield. In 1950, the Westham Bridge, which had been subject to flooding and was inadequate for traffic in the growing suburban area, was replaced by the new Huguenot Memorial Bridge, named in honor of the French Huguenot settlers who came to the area in the 18th century to escape religious persecution in France. The old bridge was dismantled, but the abutments for it remained visible at each end, and overhead power and telephone lines continued to mark the route.

It is native to much of central and eastern North America and is particularly common in the Midwest, but it has also been introduced well beyond its natural range. Naturally it can be found growing wild at the borders of woods, along streams or in open meadows. It often has difficulty seeding itself in its native areas due to parasitic weevils that enter the seed pods, making the number of viable seeds very low. The seeds may be toxic. Young seed pods Names The name of the genus is derived from the Ancient Greek word bapto, meaning \\"to dip\\" or \\"immerse\\", while the specific name australis is Latin for \\"southern\\". Additional common names of this plant exist, such as indigo weed, rattleweed, rattlebush and horsefly weed. The common name \\"blue false indigo\\" is derived from it being used as a substitute for the superior dye-producing plant Indigofera tinctoria. Description B. australis is an herbaceous perennial that reproduces both sexually and asexually by means of its spreading rhizomes. The plant is erect and emerges from the rhizomatic network. The roots themselves are branched and deep, which helps the plant withstand periods of drought. When dug up they are woody and black in colour and show tubercles, wart-like projections found on the roots. The plant branches extensively about halfway up. The stems are stour and glabrous, or hairless. Broken stems secrete a sap that turns dark blue on contact with the air. The plant may attain a height of 1 to 1.5 metres, and a width of 0.6 to 1 metre. The grey-green trifoliate leaves are arranged alternately, and are further divided into clover-like leaflets that are obovate in shape, or wider towards the apex. Flower spikes appear in early summer. Emerging at the pinnacle are short, upright terminal racemes with pea-like flowers that vary in colour from light blue to deep violet. The flowers, which bloom from spring to summer depending on the region, are bisexual and are roughly long. The fruit is a bluish black inflated and hardened pod that ranges from in length by . They are oblong in shape and are sharply tipped at the apex. At maturity they will contain many loose seeds within. The seeds are yellowish brown, kidney shaped and about in size. The leaves emerge about one month before flowering and are shed approximately one month after the pods form. Once the seeds are fully mature, the stems turn a silverish grey and break off from the roots. The pods stay attached and are blown with the stems to another location. Toxicity Young shoots of the plant have been mistaken for asparagus, which resulted in poisoning. The seeds may be toxic, especially for children.Aleguas, A., et al. (2010) Pediatric poisoning from Baptisia australis, in Abstracts of the 2010 North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology Annual Meeting, October 7‚Äì12, 2010, Denver, CO, USA. Clinical Toxicology 48:6 627. Taxonomy There are three recognised varieties of B. australis: *Baptisia australis var. abberans *Baptisia australis var. australis *Baptisia australis var. minor pea family flower structure Cultivation B. australis is the most commonly cultivated species in its genus, and is also cultivated beyond its native continent in other areas such as Great Britain, where it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is considered to be a desirable plant in the garden due to its deep blue to violet spring flowers, the attractive light green compound leaves, and also for the somewhat unusual oblong fruits that emerge in the late summer. B. australis grows best in lime- free, well-drained stony soil in full sun to part shade. It grows to about tall in height with a similar spread. Like other members of the genus, it has a very deep taproot, which makes it quite difficult to move once planted. It thrives in full sun and requires water only in times of low rainfall. One slightly negative feature it that the leaves tend to drop early in the fall, but this may be avoided by cutting the dead stems as they die back. It is hardy in USDA zones 3 through 8. It is commonly employed as a border plant in gardens. While there are no commonly available cultivars, several hybrids involving B. australis have been created, such as 'Purple Smoke', which is a cross with Baptisia alba. The variety B. australis var. minor is also used occasionally in gardens. It is much shorter at only in height, but the flowers are equal in size. Other uses Several American Indian tribes have made use of the plant for a variety of purposes. The Cherokees used it as a source of blue dye, a practice later copied by European settlers. They also would use the roots in teas as a purgative or to treat tooth aches and nausea, while the Osage made an eyewash with the plant. References External links *Blue Wild Indigo.

He plays guitar, pedal steel, piano, violin, dobro, hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, saxophone, the theremin and many other instruments. According to Colin Meloy, as stated at the Pilgrimage Festival in Franklin, TN on September 27, 2015, Funk was originally given the middle name \\"Ryman\\" but a clerical error on his birth certificate resulted in his middle name being recorded as \\"Lyman.\\"  Early life  Funk attended Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and is originally from Valparaiso, Indiana.  Musical career  Funk joined the Decemberists after meeting Colin Meloy at a solo show Meloy was performing. He has been a member of the band since its formation, appearing on every Decemberists record since. Funk most commonly contributes guitar, pedal steel, and mandolin tracks to the band's songs, though he has laid down tracks with several other instruments as well. After an incident in which the band's equipment trailer was stolen in 2005, Funk wrote \\"This Machine Kills Thieves\\" on his banjo, in reference to Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. He is a member of Knock-knock with DJ Rev. Shines (from the hip-hop group Lifesavas on Quannum Projects). He is also a member of the string band Black Prairie who released their first album, Feast of the Hunter's Moon, in 2010. He plays in the country rock group Blue Giant. He has produced records for The Builders and The Butchers, Langhorne Slim, and Red Fang, and curated the Portland edition of Burn to Shine DVD released in 2006. On December 20, 2006, Funk appeared on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report to end a longstanding mock feud with the show's host, Stephen Colbert. A contest ensued in which Funk and Colbert would each play a guitar solo while a panel of judges decided the winner. After Funk's solo, Colbert (who cannot play the guitar) feigned an injured hand, having Peter Frampton fill in for him instead. The contest ended with Colbert/Frampton being decided the winners by show guests Eliot Spitzer and Henry Kissinger, and Colbert was awarded The Crane Wife by The Decemberists as the grand prize. Funk then performed an \\"all-guitar jam\\" alongside Frampton, Robert Schneider (of The Apples in Stereo), and Rick Nielsen.

They were Premiership Division One champions for three consecutive seasons from 2003‚Äì04 to 2005‚Äì06. History In Paris on 27 August 1995 a meeting of the International Rugby Board declared that professionalism was to be allowed in rugby. At that time there were differing views as to whether districts or Premier clubs in Scotland would take the game forward into the professional era and, with a number of top Glasgow players moving east, Glasgow rugby was looking extremely vulnerable. Although some thought it highly unlikely that Glasgow Academicals (1866) and GHK (1982) might merge, during season 1996‚Äì97 Brian Simmers decided it was worth looking at. After meetings with the SRU, Dunc Paterson, Bill Watson, Jim Telfer and Bill Hogg, and meetings with senior players from both clubs, Fergus Wallace and Murray Wallace, Walter Malcolm, Cameron Little, Gordon Mackay, Charles Afuakwah, Stuart Simmers, he produced a proposal for rugby at Anniesland which created a new club, Glasgow Hawks, but retained the \\"founder\\" clubs, Glasgow Academicals and GHK. Discussions had also taken place with West of Scotland to come on board but these did not progress. However the \\"W\\" in HAWKS still remains. This initial structure was finalised with the help of Sandy Neilson (GHK), Lorne Crerar (GHK), Richard Eadie (GHK), Graham McKnight (GAC), Sandy Bannerman (GAC), David Jerdan (GHK), Kenny Hamilton (GHK), David Williams (GHK) and Hugh Barrow and it was agreed that this was preferable to a straight merger as it would maximise player numbers at Old and New Anniesland. Ownership of Glasgow Hawks RFC Limited would be one share (50%) each held by Glasgow Academicals Sports Club (now Glasgow Academical Club) and GHK (now Glasgow High School Club Ltd.). It was also agreed that Hawks 1st XV would play alternately at Old and New with the 2nd XV playing at the unused ground. (For cost and facility reasons Hawks moved entirely to Old Anniesland in 2001 and as a result of poor Old Anniesland ground conditions, Hawks 2nd XV agreed, in 2007, to play at New Anniesland). Brian Simmers established with the SRU that Hawks would take over the top club's (Accies) position in Premier 2 from the end of season 1996‚Äì97 but was unable to persuade them to allow GHK and Accies a position in the National Divisions and they therefore had to start at the foot of the Regionals. This structure was presented to each of the \\"founder\\" clubs at EGMs, both held on 3 June 1997, and a massive majority at each club agreed the proposal. In June 2003 Glasgow Hawks became a full member of the SRU. Rugby In season 1997‚Äì98 contracted players were playing for Premier 1 clubs and Hawks, funded by generous sponsors, had managed to pull together a formidable squad. The majority were Scottish representative players with eventual internationalists Glenn Metcalfe, Derek Stark and Murray Wallace joined by Cook Island internationalists Tommy Hayes and Mike Beckham. Hawks won the second division league title, the Scottish Cup and were 2nd XV league champions. At the end of this very successful season eight players moved out of Hawks to professional rugby in Scotland and beyond. 1999‚Äì00: Hawks lost to Boroughmuir in the Scottish Cup Final and played the Co-optimists to mark the opening of the Jimmie Ireland stand at Old Anniesland and combined with West of Scotland, again to play the Co-optimists, to mark the opening of their new stand at Burnbrae. 2001‚Äì02: Hawks are runners-up to Hawick (losing in extra time) in the Scottish Cup Final. 2003‚Äì04: Hawks win Premier 1 Championship, Scottish Cup and 2nd XV Championship. 2004‚Äì05: Hawks retain Premier 1 and 2nd XV LeagueChampionships 2005‚Äì06: Hawks secure the hattrick of Premier 1 Championships at Meggetland, the first time in 80 years that a club from Glasgow has achieved this honour. 2006‚Äì07: Hawks win the Scottish Cup for the third time and in May 2007 beat the Royal Navy in a memorial match for Craig Hodgkinson. It has always been a policy of Hawks to test themselves against \\"foreign\\" opposition: 1998, Stade Toulousain, France 1999, Club Atl√©tico del Rosario, Argentina 2003, Tour of South Africa (three matches) 2004, Sale Academy 2005, Racing Club de France 2006, Capitolina, Rome All of these games were won except against Capitolina. Hawks has accepted the introduction of the professional districts and agree with the decision by the SRU in 2007 to reduce the number of districts to two on the grounds that they are effectively funded and therefore should become successful in Celtic and European competition, which must be of benefit to the national team. =Hawks Players Capped= *9 Scottish Caps, 1 \\"A\\" cap, 5 Sevens caps *Scotland \\"Club\\" Caps: 6.

One of the country's first urban sculptures of great dimensions, had its planning started in 1957 with the ideas of renowned Mexican architect Luis Barrag√°n, painter Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira and sculptor Mathias Goeritz. The project was originally planned to be composed of seven towers, with the tallest one reaching a height of 200 meters (about 650 feet), but a budget reduction forced the design to be composed of only five towers, with the tallest measuring 52 meters (170 feet) and the shortest 30 meters (98 feet). Goeritz originally wanted the towers to be painted in different shades of orange, but changed his mind later due to some pressure from constructors and investors. It was finally decided that there would be one tower each in red, blue and yellow, the primary subtractive colors, and two in white. Thus, in the first days of March 1958, the Sat√©lite Towers were inaugurated as the symbol of the newborn and modern Ciudad Sat√©lite. In popular culture The towers appear prominently in the surrealist film The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky. The unnamed protagonist is hoisted up the red tower, which he then enters via a circular hole in its side (painted on for the purposes of the film). Within he encounters an Alchemist, and begins a metaphysical transformation. References External links *‚ÄîAyuntamiento de Naucalpan de Ju√°rez ‚Äî Official website.

Background Although already inhabited by Native Americans, the territory that is now California was claimed by the Spanish Empire in 1542 by right of discovery when Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo explored the Pacific Coast. Cabrillo's exploration laid claim to the coastline as far north as forty-two degrees north latitude. This northern limit was later confirmed by the United States in the 1819 Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty. A competing claim was established for England in 1579 by the privateer Francis Drake, who followed the trans-Pacific route from the Philippines established by the Manila Galleons and reached the California coast near Cape Mendocino, from which he then sailed south along the coast at least as far as Point Reyes. In 1596, a Portuguese captain sailing for Spain, Sebasti√£o Rodrigues Soromenho (Spanish: Cerme√±o) explored some of the same coastline, leaving a description of coastal features. The Portol√° expedition carried a copy of Cerme√±o's writings to guide them along the coast. Cerme√±o was followed in 1602 by Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no, whose coastal explorations in 1602 surveyed several California locations for future colonization, including San Diego, the California Channel Islands and Monterey. Vizca√≠no sailed north from Mexico (as Cabrillo had done), a much more difficult undertaking because of the prevailing winds and ocean currents. After Vizca√≠no, however, the Spanish Empire did little to protect or settle this region for the next 160 years, and accomplished almost no exploration by land. Affairs in Europe took precedence, keeping all of the maritime powers occupied. The little settlement that did occur included the establishment of several missions on the Baja California Peninsula by Spanish Jesuit missionaries. Gaspar de Portol√° y Rovira Then, in 1767, Charles III of Spain expelled the Jesuit order from the Spanish kingdom. Gaspar de Portol√°, a Catalan military officer and colonial administrator, was appointed governor of the new province of Las Californias and sent to dispossess the Jesuits and replace them with Franciscans, who would set up their own network of missions in the colony. Gaspar came from a military background and had served as a captain of the dragoons of the Regiment of Spain immediately before being appointed governor. When he first sailed to Baja California as the new governor he brought with him 25 dragoons and 25 infantrymen in order to help him with his expulsion of the Jesuits and, eventually, the further exploration of the rest of California. His military background would prove very helpful during the expedition. =Decision to send expedition= By the late 1760s, the Spanish king and a handful of other European rulers began to realize the importance the Pacific coast of North America would have in maritime trade and activity. The Russians had been advancing south from their strongholds in present-day Alaska, and the British had been pushing west in Canada and were approaching the Pacific coast. In order to secure Spain's claims in California, Charles III wanted to explore and settle the coastline so that he could create a buffer zone to protect Spain's territories from the threat of invasion. Upon hearing about the king's desire to explore Alta California, New Spain's visitador (inspector general) Jos√© de G√°lvez organized an exploratory expedition and placed Governor Portol√° in overall command. The plan called for a joint land-sea movement up the Pacific coast. The job of the ships was to keep the land contingent supplied with provisions and to carry communications between them and New Spain. Portol√° decided to travel by land. The expedition's original assignment was to travel to the \\"port of Monterey\\" described by Vizca√≠no and establish a settlement there. After that, the explorers were to continue north to locate Cerme√±o's \\"Bay of San Francisco\\", chase away any Russians encountered, claim the area for Spain and determine whether the bay would make a good port. Expedition =Baja California to San Diego= The first leg of the expedition consisted of five groups all departing from Baja California and heading north for San Diego. Three groups traveled by sea while two others traveled by land in mule trains. Three galleons, hastily built in San Blas, set sail for San Diego in early 1769: the San Carlos, captained by Vicente Vila, a lieutenant of the royal navy (whose diary survivesThe Portol√° Expedition of 1769-1770: Diary of Vicente Vila. Edited by Robert Selden Rose, University of California at Berkeley, 1911.); the San Antonio, captained by Juan P√©rez, a native of Palma de Majorca; and the San Jos√©. All three ships, crossing the Gulf of California from San Blas, arrived leaking on the east coast of Baja, requiring repairs there.James J. Rawls & Walton Bean. California: An Interpretive History, 8th edition. McGraw- Hill, 2003, p. 35. Three groups by sea On the shore of La Paz on January 9, 1769, friar Jun√≠pero Serra blessed the flagship San Carlos and its chaplain, friar Fernando Parr√≥n. Jos√© de G√°lvez, addressing the men waiting to board, declared their final destination as Monterey and their mission to plant the holy cross among the Indians. Friar Parr√≥n boarded the San Carlos along with captain Vicente Vila, followed by lieutenant Pedro Fages with his 25 Catalan volunteers; cartographer Miguel Costans√≥, who made maps and drawings to describe the journey; surgeon Pedro Prat; and a crew of 23 sailors, plus two blacksmiths, two boys, four cooks, and mate Jorge Estorace ‚Äî a crew of 62 in all.Zoeth Eldredge, \\"The March of Portol√° and the Discovery of the Bay of San Francisco,\\" p. 26. Weighing anchor, the San Carlos headed south down the Gulf of California to round Cabo San Lucas and then head north along the Pacific coast.Don DeNevi and Noel Francis Moholy. Jun√≠pero Serra: The Illustrated Story of the Franciscan Founder of California's Missions. Harper & Row, 1985, p. 70. On February 15, G√°lvez dispatched the San Antonio, captained by Juan P√©rez, from Cabo San Lucas; Franciscan friars Juan Vizca√≠no and Francisco G√≥mez served as chaplains. With sailors plus cooks, carpenters and blacksmiths, the San Antonio carried a total of around 30 men. These ships left ahead of the land groups. The San Carlos and San Antonio were followed by an additional supply ship, the San Jos√©, which was named after the patron saint of the Portol√° expedition, Saint Joseph. The San Jos√© never reached San Diego and was presumed lost at sea. Two groups by land Captain Fernando Rivera, moving north through Baja California, gathered horses and mules from the fragile chain of Catholic missions to supply his overland expedition. Jos√© de G√°lvez had ordered Rivera to requisition horses and mules from the missions without endangering their survival and to give the friars receipts for the number of animals taken; those missions would later get restocked with animals brought over from the Mexican mainland. Friar Juan Cresp√≠, selected as chaplain for the Rivera party and diarist for the Franciscan missionaries, traveled for 24 days from Mission La Pur√≠sima, approximately north to Velicat√° (near present-day Ramona, California), then the northern frontier of Spanish settlement in Baja California. There Cresp√≠ met up with the Rivera party, which set out from Velicat√° on March 24. Their mule and horse train, tended by three muleteers, carried 25 leather-jacket soldiers and 42 Baja California Christian Indians (all men).Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 210. Portol√° himself led the second land group, which set out from Loreto on March 9. Jun√≠pero Serra, assigned by Jos√© de G√°lvez to head the Franciscan missionary team into Alta California, joined the Portol√° party as chaplain and diarist. The 55-year-old Serra suffered a chronic infection of his left foot and leg, which Portol√° believed had now become cancerous. He tried to dissuade Serra from joining the expedition, but Serra refused to withdraw; he told Portol√° to go ahead, saying he would follow and meet up with Portol√° on the frontier. Meanwhile, Serra assigned friar Miguel de la Campa from Mission San Ignacio to join the Portol√° party.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 210-1. The party, driving a supply train and food animals, included 25 leather-jacket soldiers under sergeant Jos√© Francisco Ortega; muleteers; artisans; and 44 Christian Indians from Baja California, acting as servants and interpreters to communicate with Indians along the way. This group traveled slower than the Rivera party. Serra, trekking much of the way on a broken-down mule, finally caught up with Portol√°, De la Campa and the other members of their party on May 5, just south of Velicat√°. Following the trail blazed by the Rivera party, and less burdened by livestock, the Portol√° party moved somewhat faster. Even so, they had an arduous trek over deserts and through ravines. Arrival in San Diego The ships arrived in San Diego first: the San Antonio on April 11 and the San Carlos on April 29, 1769. Many crew members on both ships had fallen ill ‚Äî especially from scurvy ‚Äî during their voyages. On May 1, lieutenant Pedro Fages, engineer Miguel Costans√≥, and mate Jorge Estorace came ashore from their anchorage in San Diego Bay, along with 25 soldiers and sailors still healthy enough to work. Searching for a source of fresh water and helped by Indians they encountered, they found a suitable river about nine miles northeast. Moving their ships as close as possible, they set up a camp on the beach, surrounding it with an earthen parapet with two cannons mounted. From their ships' sails and awnings they made two large hospital tents, as well as tents for the officers and friars. Then they moved the sick men to shore and settled them into the camp. The number of men engaged in those arduous labors diminished daily due to illness. Nearly all medicines and stored food had been consumed on the long voyages. Doctor Pedro Prat ‚Äî himself weakened by scurvy ‚Äî gathered medicinal herbs in the fields and desperately tried to cure the ill men. Heat scorched them by day, cold stung them by night. Two or three men died every day, until the combined sea expedition ‚Äî which had started with over 90 men ‚Äî had shrunk to eight soldiers and eight sailors.Zoeth Eldredge, \\"The March of Portol√° and the Discovery of the Bay of San Francisco,\\" pp. 27-8. Captain Rivera's column arrived on May 14, having trekked 300 miles (480 km) in 50 days from Velicat√°On that same Pentecost day of May 14, 1769, Jun√≠pero Serra founded Misi√≥n San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a de Velicat√° in a mud hut, at the point of origin of the Rivera party's trek to San Diego. without losing a single man or having a sick one ‚Äî although with their food rations drastically reduced. Rivera's men moved the camp slightly inland near the San Diego River, building the new camp on a hill now known as Old Town. They erected a stockade and mounted a cannon on land that later became the Presidio of San Diego.Zoeth Eldredge & Juan Manuel de Ayala, \\"The March of Portol√° and the Discovery of the Bay of San Francisco,\\" p. 28. The commanding officers prepared to dispatch the San Antonio back to Lower California New Spain, to report to viceroy De Croix and visitador G√°lvez about the expedition. On July 1, just as the ship was about to sail, the Portol√°/Serra party arrived in San Diego in good health, with 163 mules loaded with supplies. Desiring to push the sea expedition north to Monterey ‚Äî as G√°lvez had instructed ‚Äî Portol√° offered captain Vicente Vila of the San Carlos 16 of his own men to work the ship on its voyage to Monterey. But Vila had lost all his ship's officers, his boatswain, coxswain of the launch and storekeeper ‚Äî and none of the men offered by Portol√° had experience as sailors. Vila refused to sail under such conditions. So Portol√° decided to place all available sailors aboard the San Antonio, which set out for San Blas on July 9, with a very small crew.Zoeth Eldredge & Juan Manuel de Ayala, \\"The March of Portol√° and the Discovery of the Bay of San Francisco,\\" p. 29. Carrying important letters from Serra, Portol√° and others, the San Antonio reached San Blas in just three weeks. On that voyage, several more sailors died.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 232. After the four groups had reunited in San Diego, friars Juan Vizca√≠no and Fernando Parr√≥n stayed there with Jun√≠pero Serra to head the new mission San Diego. Friars Juan Cresp√≠ and Francisco G√≥mez continued north with Portol√°. Serra's group aimed to establish Catholic missions to convert the natives of Alta California to Christianity. Cresp√≠ was the only one who traveled with the land expedition throughout its travels, so he became the official diarist for the missionaries (Portol√° and Costans√≥ also kept diaries). The Franciscans ultimately founded twenty-one missions at or near the Pacific Coast of what is now the state of California, in addition to one mission in Baja California. The string of California missions began at San Diego. =San Diego to San Francisco, flummoxed at Monterey (1769)= After two weeks of recuperation, Portol√° resumed the northward march to rediscover Vizca√≠no's port of Monterey by land, with a party of 74 men: lieutenant Pedro Fages with his Catalan volunteers; leather- jacket soldiers; captain Fernando Rivera; sergeant Jos√© Francisco Ortega leading the scouts; engineer and cartographer Miguel Costans√≥; Baja California Christian Indians; and friars Juan Cresp√≠ and Francisco G√≥mez; the Franciscan missionary college of San Fernando had appointed Cresp√≠ official diarist of the expedition. On July 14, 1769, after the friars held a Mass in honor of saint Joseph ‚Äî patron saint of the Portol√° expedition ‚Äî the Portol√° party pulled out of San Diego. Serra stayed behind, as did captain Vicente Vila and the few sailors who remained on the San Carlos. Serra founded mission San Diego in a humble building just two days after the expedition's departure. While Portol√° moved north, more men died in San Diego: Eight soldiers, four sailors, eight Christian Indians, and one servant perished by the time the Portol√° party returned six months later.Zoeth Eldredge, \\"The March of Portol√° and the Discovery of the Bay of San Francisco,\\" p. 30. Earthquakes around future Los Angeles On July 28, the Portol√° party reached a major southern California river, which the soldiers called the Santa Ana River. That afternoon they felt a strong earthquake, with aftershocks jolting them over the next few days. On August 2 they traveled west out of San Gabriel Valley, through the hills to a river Cresp√≠ named El R√≠o de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles de Porci√∫ncula ‚Äî site of the future pueblo of Los Angeles. They continued moving northwest along a route that would become El Camino Real (royal path or road) in Alta California. Monterey Bay hidden in plain sight On September 30, as the party camped by a river just south of today's Salinas, scouts ranged west to the coast. They reached Monterey Bay but failed to recognize it as the port described by Vizca√≠no 167 years earlier. The rest of the party reached Monterey Bay on October 1 ‚Äî but still failed to recognize it as their destination, because it did not seem to match the grand scale described by Vizca√≠no. Also, Portol√° and his hungry men had hoped to find the supply ship San Jos√© waiting for them at anchor in their destination harbor of Monterey.James J. Rawls & Walton Bean. California: An Interpretive History, 8th edition. McGraw-Hill, 2003, p. 36. They never saw the San Jos√©, apparently lost at sea. Its morale waning, the party resumed its march on October 7, reaching the area of Espinosa Lake east of today's Castroville. By then, at least ten of the party were being carried on litters, due to the effects of scurvy.Gary S. Breschini, \\"The Portol√° Expedition of 1769,\\" Monterey County Historical Society. Rounding San Francisco Bay Portol√° and his men continued north along the coast, hoping to find the great port they had now left behind. On October 30, they reached the headlands near today's Moss Beach. Looking into the Pacific Ocean, they could see the Farallon Islands due west ‚Äî and Drakes Bay curving broadly to Point Reyes across 40 miles (65 km) of open water to the northwest. They mistook Drakes Bay for the bay named by previous naval explorers the \\"port of San Francisco.\\" The sight convinced some, but not all of them that they had indeed bypassed the port of Monterey. Sergeant Ortega, contacting a group of Indians, thought they were trying to notify him of a ship anchored somewhere up north; for weeks, the men of the expedition had sought desperately for a harbor with a ship laden with food supplies. Heading a party of scouts up and over Montara Mountain, Ortega reached the area now known as Devil's Slide. They found their northward advance blocked by the mouth of a vast bay they could not identify ‚Äî known today as San Francisco Bay.James J. Rawls & Walton Bean. California: An Interpretive History, 8th edition. McGraw-Hill, 2003, pp. 36-7. Ortega and his scouts turned back south along the west shore of the bay, around the southern end and back up the east side. However, they only got as far as present-day Hayward before turning back ‚Äî because their allotted three days were up. When the scouts returned and described what they had seen, Portol√° led the entire party up into the hills, to a place where the entire San Francisco Bay was visible. Only friar Cresp√≠ seemed to grasp the importance of the bay, describing it in his diary as \\"a very large and fine harbor, such that not only all the navy of our Most Catholic Majesty but those of all Europe could take shelter in it.\\" =Return trip= On November 11, Portol√° convened an officers' council, which agreed unanimously that 1) they must have passed Monterey, 2) it was time to turn around and retrace their steps back to San Diego, and 3) no one would be left behind hoping for a supply ship to arrive. The entire party headed back south. On November 28, the party crossed the Monterey Peninsula south to Carmel Bay. A week later, while waiting for two Baja Christian Indians who got separated from Rivera's group, the expedition leaders discussed their next moves. They still did not believe they had found Vizca√≠no's port of Monterey. On December 7, they decided to return to San Diego without waiting any longer for the missing men, or for a supply ship. On December 10, Portol√° ordered his men to plant a large wooden cross where passing ships could see it, with a letter describing the expedition's travels buried at its foot. Cresp√≠ quoted part of the letter: \\"The cross was planted on a hill on the edge of the beach of the little bay which lies to the south of Point Pinos (pine-covered headland).\\" Frustrated in their hunting and fishing efforts, men of the expedition had to eat seagulls and pelicans. On November 30, about a dozen Indians from the interior ‚Äî apparently Rumsen people ‚Äî visited, bringing pinole and seeds. The next day the party slaughtered a mule, but not everyone would eat it. The weather turned cold, and snow began to cover the hills. The exhausted men reached San Diego on January 24, 1770 \\"smelling frightfully of mules\\", but warmly welcomed by their fellow soldiers and friars. Apart from five men who had apparently deserted, every member of the party had survived their six-month journey. They told of large numbers of friendly Indians who lived along the coast, waiting to receive the Catholic gospel.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 237. In total they had traveled around 1,200 miles (1,900 km) and become the first Europeans to survey San Francisco Bay and many other important strategic locations. Yet friar Jun√≠pero Serra, who welcomed them back to San Diego, felt dismayed and incredulous that they had not found Monterey Bay. \\"You come from Rome without having seen the pope\\", Serra told Portol√°.Gaspar de Portol√°'s letter to a friend, Sept. 1773. Charles E. Chapman, A History of California: The Spanish Period, 1921, vol. 1, p. 227. =San Diego to Monterey (1770)= A second expedition to find Monterey Bay and establish a permanent settlement there took place in 1770. Portol√° mustered a new overland party in San Diego, consisting of less than half the number of men he had taken on his first trip to find Monterey. The new party included Pedro Fages with twelve Catalan volunteers, seven leather-jacket soldiers, two muleteers, five Baja Christian Indians, Portol√°'s servant, and friar Cresp√≠. Rivera had traveled back to Baja California to get supplies. On April 17, the Portol√° party left San Diego. Following the same route they had taken the year before, they traveled five weeks with only two days of rest, arriving at Monterey Bay on May 24. They did not lose a single man or suffer any illnesses, except for an eye infection that afflicted Fages and Cresp√≠.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 246. That afternoon, Portol√°, Cresp√≠ and a guard walked over the hills to Point Pinos on the northern tip of the Monterey peninsula, then just south to a hill by the beach where their party had planted a large cross the previous December. They found the cross surrounded by feathers and broken arrows driven into the ground, with fresh sardines and meat laid out before the cross. No Indians were in sight. In the bay waters, hundreds of seals and sea otters splashed and basked in the sun. Cresp√≠ wrote: \\"This is the port of Monterey without the slightest doubt.\\" The three men then walked along the rocky coast south to Carmel Bay. Several Indians approached them, and the two groups exchanged gifts.Don DeNevi and Noel Francis Moholy. Jun√≠pero Serra: The Illustrated Story of the Franciscan Founder of California's Missions. Harper & Row, 1985, p. 99. Meanwhile, on April 16, the San Antonio, captained by Juan P√©rez, set sail from San Diego to Monterey. On board were friar Jun√≠pero Serra, cartographer Miguel Costans√≥, and doctor Pedro Prat ‚Äî along with a stock of supplies for the new mission in Monterey. Buffeted by unfavorable winds, the San Antonio retreated back south to Baja California, then swung as far north as the Farallon Islands, 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Monterey. Several sailors fell sick with scurvy. The San Antonio finally sailed into Monterey Bay on May 31, welcomed by the Portol√° party which had arrived a week earlier.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 245-7. They returned to the wooden cross left on a hill the year before, and this time (perhaps on a clearer day) realized that the site did indeed overlook the place Vizca√≠no had described. Portol√° founded the Presidio of Monterey on that hill, and Serra founded the Mission San Carlos Borromeo (moved to Carmel the next year, a little ways to the south).The Founding of Monterey, Monterey County Historical Society On July 9, 1770, Portol√° and Costans√≥ boarded the San Antonio and sailed out of Monterey Bay, headed back to Baja California New Spain. Interactions with Native Americans For the most part, it was reported that interactions with Native American tribes in Alta California were peaceful without much conflict. Many were described as welcoming and helpful, as they offered guidance and supplies to the Spanish explorers. Friendly encounters with the native people had been a goal from the onset of the expedition, and the Spanish brought many items and trinkets with which they traded for supplies and used to create peaceful relations. They used valuable space to carry so many glass beads and other items, rather than food or more crucial supplies, in order to pacify the Native Americans, indicating that they were committed to creating peaceful relationships with the native people. The long- term goal was to create settlements, introduce farming, and convert the inhabitants to Christianity, so it was important that they had peaceful coexistence during the expedition. Legacy Elysian Park in Los Angeles, near the North Broadway-Buena Vista St. Bridge (CHL 655) The Portol√° expedition was the first land-based exploration by Europeans of what is now California. The expedition's most notable discovery was San Francisco Bay, but nearly every stop along the route was a first. It is also important in that it, along with the later de Anza expedition, established the overland route north to San Francisco which became the Camino Real. That route was integral to the settlement of Alta California by the Spanish Empire, and made it possible for the Franciscan friars to establish a string of twenty-one missions, which served as the nuclei of permanent settlements, established a cattle ranching economy and converted thousands of Native Americans to Christianity. Three diaries written by members of the expedition survive, giving unusually complete insight into the daily movements and experiences: One by Portol√° himself,Diary of Gaspar de Portol√° During the California Expedition of 1769-1770. Edited by Donald Eugene Smith & Frederick J. Teggart. University of California at Berkeley, 1909. a record by Miguel Costans√≥, and a diary by Juan Cresp√≠ which is the most complete and detailed of the three. When Portol√° returned to New Spain in 1770, Pedro Fages (now promoted to captain) was appointed lieutenant governor of Alta California, with headquarters at the Presidio of Monterey. Fages led further exploratory trips to the east side of San Francisco Bay, and left his own diaries.

It is part of the district Merzig-Wadern. Wadern consists of 13 urban districts with approximately 16.000 inhabitants. With 143 inhabitants per km2 it is sparsely populated, but, with an area of 111 km2, Wadern is the third largest municipality in Saarland after Saarbr√ºcken and St. Wendel. The town is divided into 14 urban districts and altogether 24 villages belong to the commune. The town is part of the Moselle Franconian language area. Geography Wadern is located at the foot of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald History Stone tools and different grave-mounds in the so-called \\"Hochwald\\" region are evidence for the city's existence in a time where there were no written sources ever found (Prehistory). In connection with the conquest by the Romans (58-51/50 B.C.) first written reports were discovered. Gaius Julius Caesar, the Roman general, created a detailed and written description of the people who were living in this area of Germany at this time with a comment about their rites and customs. This part of Germany's economy and culture benefitted from the improvements of the traffic infrastructure, which was constructed by the Romans; because of this extension and progress the Celtic population increased. The first decades after Christ were struck by increased collapsing Germanic tribes, what eventually lead to the dissolution of the Roman Empire as well as to this region being integrated into France. Agricultural and housing development in the Hochwald were able to extend since there was unused land available to spread out on. In the Middle Ages a lot of clearance was done, which resulted in the most common name endings: -bach, -feld and -rod of the towns around this area. What is now the city of Wadern used to belong to various territories, for example to the Erzstift Trier, Dukedom Lothringen or to the governance of Dagstuhl. Especially the governance of Dagstuhl took the main role in the development of downtown Wadern. In 1680 this south-western part of Germany was governed by the counts of Oettingen - Baldern, count Joseph Anton of Oettingen - Baldern and Soetern took over the governance of Dagstuhl in the 18th century. He moved his residence and his royal household completely to Dagstuhl and resided in his castle built in 1760. With his engagement and expertise he succeeded in improving the economic situation in Dagstuhl. The conferment issued in 1765 of the market right contributed as the most important renewal for Wadern. The then created marketplace and the established market fountain are even today visible signs of this market right. With indenting French revolutionary troops the feudalism was dissolved and the possession went over to French state possession, thus also castle Dagstuhl which baron Wilhelm Albert de Lasalle took over from Luisenthal in 1807. Castle M√ºnchweiler was bought back in 1801 by his former owner again. The current city became a French state area in 1801, then got within the scape of the territorial reorganisation by the Wiener congress in 1815 under Prussian management. By the production of the new outlets for the Saarland coal the number of the people from the Hochwald who were occupied in the mining, grew since the middle of the 19th century. Agriculture was often pursued as a supplementary income. In addition, the connection of the current city with the railroad network led to an economic impetus which also affected the small crafts enterprises positively.

Constructions =Burgruine Dagstuhl= Burgruine Dagstuhl According to the present documents the castle was built before 1290 by Knight Boemund von Saarbr√ºcken as an outpost of the rule of the bishop of Trier. The plant is a motte and shows with its baily castle and its bastions a length over 300 meters. After the extinction of the lords of the castle in the 14. century the power disintegrated into the heirs of Fleckenstein, Brucken, Rollingen and Kriechingen, who managed the castle alternately. The plant became subsequently took down by Wolfgang Anton von Langenmantel the administrator of Dompropst and later by archbishop and elector of Trier, Franz Goerg von Sch√∂nborn. Since the mid-80s the remains of the castle were exposed and saved. Because of redevelopment measures between 2002 and 2006 a historical path is achievable by two bridges. The didactic processing of information boards and presentations on the internet finished the work. =Palace and chapel of Dagstuhl= The palace of Dagstuhl was the former domicile of count Joseph Anton von Oettingen-S√∂tern. He let this palace built between 1760 and 1762 and in 1775 it was widened. While the French revolution the count escaped and so in 1806 the family of Lasalle von Louisenthal took the building. To get a spatial link between the living space and the chapel new extension were built in 1906. Ceiling and walls were painted by Octavie de Lasalle. She laid them out with biblical historical paintings. In the extension of the chapel there is a painted way of cross by her, which originally comes from the church of Lockweiler. Until 1957 the palace was property of the family. After that, it was an old people's home for many years. Today the renowned Leibniz-Zentrum for computer science works in it. A castle garden, which was put on within the scope of the project G√§rten ohne Grenzen belongs to the palace. Many creation signs of the garden decrease to suggestions of the \\"painter's countess\\" Octavie de Lasalle, who had documented her images in different garden paintings. =M√ºnchweiler's Castle= With baron Franz Georg Zandt von Merl's concept and the plans of an unknown architect from the circle of builder Christian Kretschmar, the castle was built between 1749 and 1785 in M√ºnchweiler. A drive lines with chestnuts leads to a big portal and a castle courtyard, which is framed by the residential building and the working quarters. The wings were expanded in the 19th century. The castle has also a baroque-garden. This shape is unique in Saarland and today it is used as a hotel and a caf√©. =Castle of Counts Wadern= In 1758 count Joseph Anton von Oettingen-S√∂tern built the first of his three castles, Castle of Counts, in the Oberstra√üe in Wadern. A former building at this place was mainly used for the counts administration. It was used as magistrate's court head office from 1827 to 1959 with interruptions. The building was used by the Hochwald Gymnasium from 1959 to 1961 until their new building was ready. Today the last part is used as a part of the town hall. It is a plain building from the late Baroque era, divides by five axis with a steep hipped roof and five dormers. The original stairwell with a wooden railing and a pattern like a chain is still inside of today's town hall. =Oettinger Schl√∂sschen Wadern= Oettinger Schl√∂sschen Wadern In 1759 count Joseph Anton built the Oettinger Schl√∂sschen with a park as his first residence in Wadern. After the period of the counts, first the castle was used as a restaurant, after that as a pharmacy. At the exterior wall, visitors can find the Waderner Elle, a special measure which drapers and leather-merchants had to use at the markets. Just before the planned demolition, local geographers and historians saved it. Today, it accommodates the town museum and the council hall. =Marketplace fountain Wadern= Marketplace fountain Wadern The Marketplace Fountain is the visible sign that count Joseph Anton von Oettingen-S√∂tern awarded the craft- and business centre of Wadern to have the right to hold a market on 13. April 1765. The fountain itself was built in 1770 but it had to change its place a few times. After the redesigning of the marketplace it is near his original place again. Events =Regular events= The most important events in the Town of Wadern in chronological order: The first Sunday during the act of fasting: Lauf des Erbsenrades in Wadrill: according to an old custom the winter ends with a burning spinwheel. On Palm Sunday: Kunstroute Wadern: More than 30 artists present their work during the open-for-business Sunday in the different stores downtown. A quiet unique event in Saarland. Second weekend in June: Stadtfest Waderner Maad (dialected for \\"market\\"): embedded in historical occasions around the effects of the Earl Joseph Anton von √ñttinger-Soetern in village fair is the biggest folk festival in the whole Hochwald area. On numerous weekends from June till August is the Waderner Marktsommer, which features multifaceted music program at the market square of Wadern. It is free and in the open. The first weekend in August is dedicated to the festivity Sagenhaftes Spektakulum auf Burg Dagstuhl. On the Burgruine ( which means \\"castle ruin\\") Dagstuhl concerts. Camp life, medieval crafts and a knight- competition for children are combining to one of the most beautiful medieval festivals in Saarland. In September there is the Waderner Buchwoche, with nights especially for reading (the so-called \\"Lesen√§chte\\"), culinary crime evenings, writing competitions (every two years) and the great book flea- market. In the fall there are events like Hochw√§lder Kartoffeltage (Kartoffel = \\"potato\\") and the Hochw√§lder Wildwoche that form culinary activities. Every year the club Konzerte in der Kleinen Residenz offers a versatile concert program which ranges from classic to jazz music. Another association, Kultur am Tor, focuses on music, cabaret and readings throughout the year. Economy and infrastructure The city Wadern as centre is not only an administrative, social and cultural centre in the north of Saarland, but is also an economic centre of Hochwald region. The city Wadern lays in intersection between the region Saar-Lor-Lux and the region of Hochwald in the north of Saarland. =Markets= Every last Wednesday of the month the big Krammarkt takes place in the district of Wadern. Furthermore, convenient goods are offered on the fresh market at the market square every Friday morning. The annually city festival Waderner Maad, which is celebrated at the beginning of June, reminds of this market tradition as well. The meaning of markets and in connection to that the formation of the market square in the district Wadern is closely associated with the count Joseph Anton from Oettingen-Stern and his influence on the community. After transferring from N√∂rdlinger Ries to Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald he put a special value on the economic development of his administrative residence Wadern. On the 13th of April 1765 the count gave the city the right to hold markets and up until now they take place at the market square, which was only built for this occasion. Especially the livestock markets (cattle and pigs) were also known out of Wadern's boundaries. In particular during the second half of the 19th century they were one of the biggest markets in the Prussian administrative district of Trier. A symbol for the right to hold markets is the market fountain, which was built in 1770. =Walking and bike riding= The city Wadern offers a wealth of opportunities to get to know its charm. In particular the hiking trails Wadrilltafel, Almgl√ºck, Weg des Wassers, Himmels G√§√§s Paad and Saar-Hunsr√ºck-Steig offer extraordinary experiences in nature. Biking tourism plays an important role in the town Wadern. Both the Saarland-Radweg and the Saar-Bostalsee-Radweg cross the town area. In addition to these national biking tours, there are regional tracks in the administrative district like the Noswendler- See- Runde, Drei- Seen-Runde and Hochw√§lder Runde. =Leisure centre Noswendler lake= The leisure centre Noswendler lake contains 20ha and the lake itself has a size of 6.6ha. Due to the great commitment of the local clubs, which are organized in the home and traffic club, the hospitality and extensive event programs during the summer are guaranteed. One can for example explore the lake with a paddle boat. Two playgrounds including a basketball court and a beach volleyball field at the shore invite to play. During a walk one can take a look at the nature reserve Noswendler Bruch, which is the biggest wet biotope in the Saarland. The hiking trails, which are well marked, give visitors many possibilities to explore nature. Three trails with 2.5 km, 6 km or 8 km length invite to walk or hike around the lake with stops included. The Naturpfad, for example, leads right into the Noswendler Bruch. At the lake there is cold- water treatment, and five camper parking spaces. Outstanding events during the year include the Lampionfest, Herbst- Schlachtfest, Deko- Volkslauf and Saktrorennen. =Companies= Representative for the companies, which are located in the city of Wadern, only the foreign enterprises with the most employments are listed in this enumeration.

He currently serves in the Chamber of Deputies of the Mexican Congress as an Ecologist Green Party of Mexico proportional representation deputy. Political career Canavati's political career started in the late 1960s in the Mexico City Metro, where he was an administrative assistant, deputy director general, and comptroller. He then transferred to the Department of the Federal District, where he spent a year as the coordinator of the Directorate of Information and Statistical Analysis. In 1973, his political career moved to his hometown of Monterrey. He was the town's general comptroller; a year later, he became the director general of the Trust for the Metropolitan Fund of Monterrey (FOMERREY). He served as mayor of San Nicol√°s de los Garza (1979-1982), and after a brief stint in the PRI's teaching arm in Nuevo Le√≥n, he occupied a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for the LIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, which convened from 1985 to 1988. He was a senator in the LIV Legislature from 1988 to 1991, during which time he briefly served as the president of a PRI commission on financing and asset management. During the early and mid-1990s, he served in various public service positions, including in the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology and then within the Secretariat of Social Development. In 1997, voters sent Canavati back to the Chamber of Deputies for the LVII Legislature. He was the vice coordinator of the PRI parliamentary group and its primary spokesman. Additionally, he sat on commissions dealing with Urban Development and Land Use; Economic Development; Foreign Relations/North America and Foreign Relations/Europe and Africa; Communications and Transportation; and Bicameral for the Canal del Congreso, and was a general coordinator in the National Confederation of Popular Organizations. In 2000, Canavati was elected to serve in the Senate once more, for the LVIII Legislature. He sat on most of the comparable commissions to those from his previous term in the Chamber of Deputies. During this time, he was the president of the PRI in Nuevo Le√≥n. He permanently resigned from the Senate effective March 18, 2003, in order to begin his campaign for the municipal presidency of Monterrey. He defeated PAN candidate Francisco Cant√∫, and in taking the mayorship of the city, he was replaced in the Senate by his alternate, Rub√©n Zaraz√∫a Rocha.

J. Smeed, who first proposed the relationship in 1949, is a purported empirical rule relating traffic fatalities to traffic congestion as measured by the proxy of motor vehicle registrations and country population. The law proposes that increasing traffic volume (an increase in motor vehicle registrations) leads to an increase in fatalities per capita, but a decrease in fatalities per vehicle. Smeed also predicted that the average speed of traffic in central London would always be nine miles per hour, because that is the minimum speed that people tolerate. He predicted that any intervention intended to speed traffic would only lead to more people driving at this \\"tolerable\\" speed unless there were any other disincentives against doing so. His hypothesis in relation to road traffic safety has been refuted by several authors, who point out that fatalities per person have decreased in many countries, when the \\"Law\\" requires that they should increase as long as the number of vehicles per person continues to rise.  Smeed's formula  Smeed's formula is expressed as: :D = 0.0003(np^2)^{1/3} or, weighted per capita, :{D \\\\over p} = 0.0003 \\\\times {\\\\sqrt[3]{n \\\\over p}} where D is annual road deaths, n is number of registered vehicles, and p is population. Smeed published his research for twenty different countries, and, by his death in 1976, he had expanded this to 46 countries, all showing this result. Smeed became deputy director of the Road Research Laboratory and, later, Professor at University College London.  Smeed's interpretation  =Road safety= thumb Smeed claimed his law expresses a hypothesis of group psychology: people take advantage of improvements in automobiles or infrastructure to drive ever more recklessly in the interests of speed until deaths rise to a socially unacceptable level, at which point, safety becomes more important, and recklessness less tolerated. Freeman Dyson summarized his friend's view as: > Smeed had a fatalistic view of traffic flow. He said that the average speed > of traffic in central London would always be nine miles per hour, because > that is the minimum speed that people will tolerate. Intelligent use of > traffic lights might increase the number of cars on the roads but would not > increase their speed. As soon as the traffic flowed faster, more drivers > would come to slow it down.....Smeed interpreted his law as a law of human > nature. The number of deaths is determined mainly by psychological factors > that are independent of material circumstances. People will drive recklessly > until the number of deaths reaches the maximum they can tolerate. When the > number exceeds that limit, they drive more carefully. Smeed's Law merely > defines the number of deaths that we find psychologically tolerable. Whilst in charge of the RRL's traffic and safety division, Smeed's views on speeds and accidents were well reported at the time of the introduction of a mandatory speed limit on UK roads: \\"If I wanted to stop all road accidents I would ban the car and introduce an overall speed limit, for there is no doubt that speed limits reduce accidents. Of course, roads with higher speeds often have lower accident rates. It is only on the safer, clear roads that you can drive fast - but that does not prove that you are driving more safely.\\" He recognised that few methods of reducing accidents were painless and thus preferred to report facts and not to make direct recommendations as: \\"political, social and economic factors come in - but the people who make the decisions must know what the facts are on a subject.\\". =Speeds on congested roads= At the opposite end of this theory was Smeed's observations of heavily congested networks. He noted that at some minimum speed, motorists would simply choose not to drive. If speeds fell below 9 mph (14.5 km/h), then drivers would keep away; as speeds rose above this limit, it would draw more drivers out until the roads became congested again.  Empirical failure  Smeed's \\"Law\\" as applied to traffic fatalities has been refuted by experience. Powles (Oxford Textbook of Public Health) notes that the Australian state of Victoria which experienced deaths in excess of the Smeed formula until about 1970, subsequently adopted a range of interventions which took it from being a poor performer in terms of road safety to one of the best. Deaths fell in absolute terms from a peak of 1000 in 1970 to below 300 in 2009, despite strong growth in population and the number of vehicles. Critics observe that fatality rates per vehicle are now decreasing faster than the formula would suggest, and that, in many cases, fatality rates per person are also falling, directly contrary to Smeed's prediction. They attribute this improvement to effective safety interventions. (see Andreassen, Broughton, Oppe, and Ameen & Naji) However, John Adams of University College London argues that Smeed's law linking deaths, vehicle-miles and population was still valid for a variety of countries over time, claiming that the relationship held for 62 countries in a paper published in 1995. He noted an enormous difference in fatality rates across different parts of the world in spite of safety interventions, and suggested that Smeed's Law was still useful in establish general trends, especially when using a very long time period. Variations from the trend were normally better explained through economics, rather than claimed safety interventions. However, Adams found that Smeed's calculation of estimated deaths from vehicles per population was less successful than the calculation for vehicle-miles. Since Smeed‚Äôs original hypothesis and interpretation of his own equation, more research has been done to try to prove or disprove this theory. In 2007, Volume 1 of the Journal of Society for Transportation and Traffic Studies was published. This study was conducted to analyze motor vehicle fatality rates in many different countries to find whether or not Smeed‚Äôs Law is still applicable in modern times. This study used a population of 139 different countries; while Smeed originally sampled 20 of the most developed countries. With a more diversified sample, the modern study is further likely presently credible that is more applicable in current years. This study concluded that Smeed‚Äôs Law is still applicable in fatalities in countries with a 0.2 - 0.3 vehicle per person ratio, but countries with a higher ratio, the number of fatalities decreases greatly. This may be that Smeed‚Äôs Law does not take into account any cultural differences nor laws that may decrease the number of fatalities. Other researchers have tried to find a way to describe the trends in countries with a higher vehicle per person ratio. ‚ÄúAs traffic increases, attitudes toward risk and road user behavior both change in a way that maintains the levels of risk that individuals collectively are prepared to tolerate‚Äù. One of the authors claims that although Smeed‚Äôs Law does apply at lower ratios, at higher ratios, a collective psychology is formed where people are more aware of the risk of motor vehicle related deaths and are inherently more careful in their driving. Since the 1940s, when Smeed‚Äôs Law was first created, the number of motor vehicles has greatly increased, but so have the number of laws, stricter speed limits, and more car safety factors and features. Education on motor vehicles and safe driving habits are more common, but have no place in Smeed‚Äôs Law. High-income countries typically are able to invest in their road infrastructure, maintenance of such infrastructure, traffic safety research and maintenance, vehicle development, and driver education. It would seem that high-income countries would do a lot better in terms of traffic related deaths, but since high-income countries also have a higher number of younger and more inexperienced drivers, this leads to an 8.3% increase in fatalities per 10% increase of young drivers. Exposure at a younger age increases the probability of a traffic related death. Even so, high-income countries commonly have a lower number of traffic related deaths when compared to low- income countries.

From left to right: Kenneth Strong, Castellano, Walter Bedell Smith and Franco Montanari. The Armistice of CassibileHoward McGaw Smyth, \\"The Armistice of Cassibile\\", Military Affairs 12:1 (1948), 12‚Äì35. was an armistice signed on 3 September 1943 by Walter Bedell Smith and Giuseppe Castellano and made public on 8 September between the Kingdom of Italy and the Allies during World War II. It was signed at a conference of generals from both sides in an Allied military camp at Cassibile, in Sicily, which had recently been occupied by the Allies. The armistice was approved by both King Victor Emmanuel III and Italian Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio. The armistice stipulated the surrender of Italy to the Allies. Germany moved rapidly, freeing Benito Mussolini and attacking Italian forces in Italy, southern France and the Balkans. Italian forces were quickly defeated, and most of Italy was occupied by German troops, who established a puppet state, the Italian Social Republic. Meanwhile, the King, the government and most of the navy reached territories occupied by the Allies. Background Following the surrender of the Axis powers in North Africa on 13 May 1943, the Allies first bombed Rome on 16 May, invaded Sicily on 10 July and prepared to land on the Italian mainland. In the spring of 1943, preoccupied by the disastrous situation of the Italian military during the war, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, removed several figures from the government whom he considered to be more loyal to King Victor Emmanuel III than to the Fascist regime. The moves by Mussolini were described as slightly- hostile acts to the King, who had grown critical of the war. To help the execution of his plan, the King asked for the assistance of Dino Grandi, one of the leading members of the Fascist hierarchy and who, in his younger years, had been considered the sole credible alternative to Mussolini as leader of the National Fascist Party. The King was also motivated by the suspicion that Grandi's ideas about Fascism might be changed abruptly. Various ambassadors, including Pietro Badoglio himself, proposed to him the vague possibility of succeeding Mussolini as dictator. The secret rebels later involved Giuseppe Bottai, another high member of the Fascist Directorate and Minister of Culture, and Galeazzo Ciano, probably the second most powerful man in the Fascist Party and Mussolini's son-in-law. The conspirators devised an Order of the Day for the next meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism (Gran Consiglio del Fascismo), which contained a proposal to restore direct control of politics to the King. Following the Council, held on 25 July 1943, the \\"order of the day\\" was adopted by majority vote, and Mussolini was then summoned to meet the King and dismissed as prime minister. Upon leaving the meeting, Mussolini was arrested by carabinieri and spirited off to the island of Ponza. Badoglio became prime minister although Grandi had been told that another general of greater personal and professional qualities (Enrico Caviglia) would have taken the position. The appointment of Badoglio apparently did not change the position of Italy as Germany's ally in the war. However, many channels sought a peace treaty with the Allies. Meanwhile, Hitler sent several divisions south of the Alps, officially to help defend Italy from Allied landings but really to control the country. General Giuseppe Castellano Three Italian generals (including Giuseppe Castellano) were separately sent to Lisbon to contact Allied diplomats. However, to open the proceedings, the Allies had to determine who was the most authoritative envoy; the three generals had started to quarrel about who had the highest authority. In the end, Castellano was admitted to speak with the Allies to set the conditions for the surrender of Italy. Among the representatives of the Allies were the British ambassador to Portugal, Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell, and two generals sent by Dwight Eisenhower: the American Walter Bedell Smith (Eisenhower's chief of staff) and the British Kenneth Strong (assistant chief of staff for intelligence). On 27 August, Castellano returned to Italy and, three days later, briefed Badoglio about the Allied request for a meeting to be held in Sicily, which had been suggested by the British Ambassador to the Vatican. To ease communication between the Allies and the Italian Government, a captured British Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent, Dick Mallaby, was released from Verona Prison and secretly moved to the Quirinale. It was vital for the Germans to remain ignorant of any suggestion of Italian surrender, and the SOE was seen as the most secure method under the circumstances. Treaty =Conditions= Badoglio still considered it possible to gain favourable conditions in exchange for the surrender. He ordered Castellano to insist for any surrender of Italy to be conditioned on a landing of Allied troops on the Italian mainland. The Allies then held only Sicily and some minor islands. On 31 August, General Castellano reached Termini Imerese, in Sicily, by plane and was transferred to Cassibile, a town near Syracuse. It soon became obvious that the two sides in the negotiations had adopted rather distant positions. Castellano pressed the request for the Italian territory to be defended from the inevitable reaction of the German Wehrmacht against Italy after the signing. In return, he received only vague promises, which included the launching of a Parachute division over Rome. Moreover, the actions were to be conducted contemporaneously with the signing, not preceding it, as the Italians had wanted. The following day, Castellano was received by Badoglio and his entourage. Foreign Minister Baron Raffaele Guariglia declared that the Allied conditions were to be accepted. Other generals, such as Giacomo Carboni, maintained that the Army Corps deployed around Rome was insufficient to protect the city because of the lack of fuel and ammunition and that the armistice had to be postponed. Badoglio did not pronounce himself in the meeting. In the afternoon he appeared before the King, who decided to accept the armistice conditions. =Signing= A confirmation telegram was sent to the Allies. The message, however, was intercepted by the German armed forces, which had long since begun to suspect that Italy was seeking a separate armistice. The Germans contacted Badoglio, who repeatedly confirmed the unwavering loyalty of Italy to its German ally. His reassurances were doubted by the Germans, and the Wehrmacht started to devise an effective plan, Operation Achse, to take control of Italy as soon as the Italian government had switched allegiance to the Allies. On 2 September, Castellano set off again to Cassibile with an order to confirm the acceptance of the Allied conditions. He had no written authorisation from the head of the Italian government, Badoglio, who wanted to dissociate himself as much as possible from the forthcoming defeat of his country. The signing ceremony began at 14:00 on 3 September. Castellano and Bedell Smith signed the accepted text on behalf of Badoglio and Eisenhower, respectively. A bombing mission on Rome by 500 airplanes was stopped at the last moment and had been Eisenhower's deterrent to accelerate the procedure of the armistice. Harold Macmillan, the British government's representative minister at the Allied Staff, informed Winston Churchill that the armistice had been signed \\"without amendments of any kind\\". Aftermath Only after the signing had taken place was Castellano informed of the additional clauses that had been presented by General Campbell to another Italian general, Zanussi, who had also been in Cassibile since 31 August. Zanussi, for unclear reasons, had not informed Castellano about them. Bedell Smith, nevertheless, explained to Castellano that the further conditions were to have taken effect only if Italy had not taken on a fighting role in the war alongside the Allies. On the afternoon of the same day, Badoglio had a briefing with the Italian Navy, Air Forces and War Ministers, as well as with the King's representatives. However, he omitted any mention of the signing of the armistice and referred only to ongoing negotiations. The day of entry into force of the armistice was linked to a planned landing in Central Italy and was left to the Allies' discretion. Castellano still understood that the date was intended to be 12 September, and Badoglio started to move troops to Rome. On 7 September, a small Allied delegation reached Rome to inform Badoglio that the next day would have been the day of the armistice. He was also informed about the pending arrival of the American 82nd Airborne Division into airports around the city. Badoglio told the delegation that his army was not ready to support this landing and that most airports in the area were under German control. He asked for a deferral of the armistice of a few days. When General Eisenhower learned that, the landing in Rome of American troops was cancelled, but the day of the armistice was confirmed since other troops were already en route by sea to land in southern Italy. When the armistice was announced by Allied radio on the afternoon of 8 September, German forces immediately attacked Italian forces by executing Operation Achse. Most of the Italian Army had not been informed about the armistice, and no clear orders had been issued about the line of conduct to be taken in the face of the German armed forces. Some of the Italian divisions that should have defended Rome were still in transit from southern France. The King, along with the royal family and Badoglio, fled Rome on the early morning of the 9th, taking shelter in Brindisi, in Southern Italy. The initial intention had been to move army headquarters out of Rome together with the King and the prime minister, but few staff officers reached Brindisi. In the meanwhile, the Italian troops, without instructions, collapsed and were soon overwhelmed; some small units decided to stay loyal to the German ally. From 8 to 12 September, German forces occupied all of the Italian territory that was still not under Allied control except Sardinia and part of Apulia without meeting much organised resistance. In Rome, an Italian governor, with the support of an Italian infantry division, nominally ruled the city until 23 September, but in practice, the city was under German control from 11 September. On 3 September, British and Canadian troops had crossed the Strait of Messina and begun landing in the southernmost tip of Calabria in Operation Baytown. The day after the armistice had been made public, 9 September, the Allies made landings at Salerno and at Taranto. The Allies failed to take full advantage of the Italian armistice and were quickly checked by German troops. In terrain that favoured defence, the Allied forces took 20 months to reach the northern borders of Italy. Some of the Italian troops based outside Italy, in the occupied Balkans and Greek islands, were able to stand some weeks after the armistice, but without any determined support by the Allies, they were all overwhelmed by the Germans by the end of September 1943. On the island of Cephalonia, the Italian Acqui Division was massacred after it had resisted German forces. Only on the islands of Leros and Samos, with British reinforcements, would the resistance last until November 1943, and in Corsica, Italian troops forced German troops to leave the island. In other cases, individual Italian units of various size stayed on the Axis side. Many of the units formed the nucleus of the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic. Italian Navy The Italian Army and Air Force were virtually disintegrated with the announcement of the armistice on 8 September. The Allies coveted the navy, with its 206 ships in total, including the battleships , , and Italia (known as until July 1943).Robert Wallace & the editors of Time-Life Books, The Italian Campaign, Time-Life Books Inc, 1978. p.57 There was a danger that some of the navy might fight on, be scuttled or (most concerningly for the Allies) end up in German hands. As such, the truce called for Italian warships on Italy's west coast, mostly at La Spezia and Genoa, to sail for North Africa and pass Corsica and Sardinia, and for those at Taranto, in the heel of Italy, to sail for Malta. At 02:30, on 9 September, the three battleships Roma, Vittorio Veneto, and Italia \\"shoved off from La Spezia escorted by three light cruisers and eight destroyers\\". When German troops who had stormed into the town to prevent the defection became enraged by the ships' escape, \\"they rounded up and summarily shot several Italian captains who, unable to get their vessels under way, had scuttled them\\". That afternoon, German bombers attacked the ships, sailing without air cover, off Sardinia, launching guided bombs. Several ships suffered damage, and Roma sank with the loss of nearly 1,400 men. Most of the remaining ships made it safely to North Africa \\"while three destroyers and a cruiser which had stopped to rescue survivors, docked in Menorca\\". The navy's turnover proceeded more smoothly in other areas of Italy. When an Allied naval force headed for the big naval base of Taranto, it watched a flotilla of Italian ships sailing out of Taranto harbour towards surrender at Malta. An agreement between the Allies and the Italians in late September provided for some of the navy to be kept in commission, but the battleships were to be reduced to care and maintenance, effectively disarmed. Italian mercantile marine vessels were to operate under the same general conditions as those of the Allies. In all cases, the Italian vessels would retain their Italian crews and fly Italian flags.Armistice with Italy: Employment and Disposition of Italian Fleet and Merchant Marine (Cunningham-de Courten Agreement) 23 September 1943 See also *Military history of Italy during World War II *Allied invasion of Italy *European Theatre of World War II *Italian Co-Belligerent Army *Operation Panzerfaust *King Michael's Coup *Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1944 *Moscow Armistice *Italian Army in Russia *Badoglio Proclamation *Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947 References Sources  External links * Il diario del generale Giuseppe Castellano, La Sicilia, 8 settembre 2003 * 8 Settembre 1943, l'armistizio Centro Studi della Resistenza dell'Anpi di Roma * The Avalon Project at Yale Law School: Terms of the Armistice with Italy; September 3, 1943 Category:20th century in Italy Category:Politics of World War II Cassibile Category:Italian campaign (World War II) Category:1943 in Italy Category:World War II treaties Category:Peace treaties of Italy Category:Peace treaties of the United States Category:Peace treaties of France Category:Peace treaties of the United Kingdom Category:History of Syracuse, Sicily Category:Treaties concluded in 1943 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1943 Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Italy (1861‚Äì1946) Category:Italy‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Peace treaties of the Soviet Union Category:September 1943 events ","title":"Armistice of Cassibile"},{"id":"2998263","text":"Chadar may refer to: *An alternative spelling of Chador *Chadar (ceremony), a marriage ceremony in Sikhism *Chadar trek ","title":"Chadar"},{"id":"2998273","text":"The Black Rob Report is the second studio album by rapper Black Rob.

The original work was created in 1923. It was sold in 2005 for $27.5 million, at the time a record price for a sculpture sold in an auction.Br√¢ncu»ôi's \\"Bird in Space\\" Sets World Auction Record for Sculpture at $27,456,000 The price record for a Br√¢ncu»ôi masterpiece was set up in 2005 when ‚ÄúBird in Space‚Äù was sold for USD 27.5 M The original title in Romanian is PasƒÉrea √Æn vƒÉzduh. Description In the Bird in Space works, Br√¢ncu»ôi concentrated not on the physical attributes of the bird, but instead on its movement. The bird's wings and feathers are eliminated, the swell of the body is elongated, and the head and beak are reduced to a slanted oval plane.Met description of Bird in Space Seven of the sculptures in the series are made of marble, while the other nine were cast in bronze. The first and best known of the series is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, while two bronze casts (1928 and c.1941) reside in that city's Museum of Modern Art. Two versions of the sculpture, one bronze (1924) and one marble (1923‚Äì1924), are housed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is home to a marble and a bronze from 1925 and 1927, respectively. A 1926 bronze is held by the Seattle Art Museum but is currently not on display. Two more bronze casts (1925‚Äì1926 and 1927) are on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a 1931 bronze cast is housed at the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena, California. Another bronze of unknown casting date resides in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra owns two marbles, both c.1931-1936, one white and one black. Legal controversy In 1926‚Äì27, Bird in Space was the subject of a court battle over its taxation by U.S. Customs. In October 1926, Bird in Space, along with 19 other Br√¢ncu»ôi sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship Paris. While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230 (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). Marcel Duchamp (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer Edward Steichen (who was to take possession of Bird in Space after exhibition), and Br√¢ncu»ôi himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the Brummer Gallery in New York City and then the Arts Club in Chicago. Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under \\"Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies\\") until a decision could be reached. However, customs appraiser F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the New York Evening Post that \\"several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government.... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Br√¢ncu»ôi's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Br√¢ncu»ôi left too much to the imagination.\\" The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision. Under the 1922 Tariff Act, for a sculpture to count as duty-free it must be an original work of art, with no practical purpose, made by a professional sculptor. No one argued that the piece had a practical purpose, but whether or not the sculpture was art was hotly contested. The 1916 case United States v. Olivotti had established that sculptures were art only if they were carved or chiseled representations of natural objects \\"in their true proportions.\\" Therefore, a series of artists and art experts testified for both the defense and the prosecution about the definition of art and who decides exactly what art is. Br√¢ncu»ôi's affidavit to the American Consulate explained the process of creating the piece, establishing its originality: :I conceived it to be created in bronze and I made a plaster model of it. This I gave to the founder, together with the formula for the bronze alloy and other necessary indications. When the roughcast was delivered to me, I had to stop up the air holes and the core hole, to correct the various defects, and to polish the bronze with files and very fine emery. All this I did myself, by hand; this artistic finishing takes a very long time and is equivalent to beginning the whole work over again. I did not allow anybody else to do any of this finishing work, as the subject of the bronze was my own special creation and nobody but myself could have carried it out to my satisfaction. Despite the varied opinions on what qualifies as art presented to the court, in November 1928 Judges Young and Waite found in favor of the artist. The decision drafted by Waite concluded: :The object now under consideration . . . is beautiful and symmetrical in outline, and while some difficulty might be encountered in associating it with a bird, it is nevertheless pleasing to look at and highly ornamental, and as we hold under the evidence that it is the original production of a professional sculptor and is in fact a piece of sculpture and a work of art according to the authorities above referred to, we sustain the protest and find that it is entitled to free entry. This was the first court decision that accepted that non-representational sculpture could be considered art. Legacy Bird in Space was the inspiration for a classical music composition by composer Timothy A. Corpus. This work was premiered at the architectural festival Open House Chicago, in which the piece was performed throughout the festival at the Arts Club of Chicago. The American poet, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) refers to Brancusi's \\"Bird\\" in her poem, \\"Reading time: 1 minute 26 seconds\\" (1939) and uses this link to highlight the fear we have of embracing the new and non-utilitarian in the arts, and to encourage us to break through an unhealthy mind-set so that we may see the world anew: \\"... The climax when the brain acknowledges the world, / all values extended into the blood awake. / Moment of proof. And as they say Brancusi did, / building his bird to extend through soaring air, / as Kafka planned stories that draw to eternity / through time extended. And the climax strikes. ...\\" (from A Turning Wind, 1939. Muriel Rukeyser).

Conceptually, it is the ratio of diffusive or conductive transport rate to the quantity storage rate, where the quantity may be either heat (thermal energy) or matter (particles). The number derives from non- dimensionalization of the heat equation (also known as Fourier's Law) or Fick's second law and is used along with the Biot number to analyze time dependent transport phenomena.  Definition  The general Fourier number is defined as: :\\\\mathrm{Fo} = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{diffusive transport rate} }{ \\\\text{storage rate} } The thermal Fourier number, , is defined by the conduction rate to the rate of thermal energy storage: :\\\\mathrm{Fo}_h = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha t}{L^2} where: * \\\\alpha = \\\\tfrac{k}{c_p \\\\rho} is the thermal diffusivity (SI units: m2/s) * t is the characteristic time (s) * L is the length through which conduction occurs (m) For transient mass transfer by diffusion, there is an analogous mass Fourier Number, , defined by: :\\\\mathrm{Fo}_m = \\\\frac{D t}{L^2} where: * D is the diffusivity (m2/s) * t is the characteristic timescale (s) * L is the length scale of interest (m)  Derivation and usage  Both forms of the Fourier number defined above are found by making the variables dimensionless of time dependent diffusion equations. To derive the heat transfer Fourier number, , the heat equation in one dimension is, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^2} Given a rod of length L that is being heated from an initial temperature, T0, by application of a higher temperature at L, TL, and the dimensionless temperature, u, defined by u = \\\\tfrac{T - T_L}{T_0 - T_L}, the differential equation can be reordered to completely dimensionless form, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial (\\\\alpha t/L^2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial (x/L)^2} The dimensionless time defines the Fourier number, . This procedure may be performed analogously on Fick's second law of diffusion to derive the mass transfer Fourier number, , and applied to time depending mass transport problems. For unsteady state conduction problems in solids, the Fourier number is frequently used as a nondimensional time parameter. Together with the Biot number, the Fourier number can be used to determine the heating or cooling of an object. If the Biot number is less than 0.1, then the entire system can be treated as uniform in temperature. The following equation, derived with the product of the Biot and Fourier numbers, can be used to estimate the time for the object to reach a specific temperature, :t = \\\\frac{\\\\rho c_p V}{h A} \\\\ln\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{T - T_\\\\infty}{T_0 - T_\\\\infty}\\\\right) where T is the temperature of the object at time t, T0 is the initial temperature, T‚àû is the temperature of the bulk fluid, V is the volume of the object, A is the surface area, and h is the convective heat transfer coefficient for the surrounding fluid.

He is the owner of Phoenix Construction, a construction company that specializes in airport construction. He owned Phoenix Racing until late 2013 when he sold the team to Harry Scott. Finch began work in construction as a teenager, and later formed Phoenix Construction Services, whose first job was at Tyndall Air Force Base. Controversies Finch and Phoenix Construction have incurred criticism and several fines for environmental infractions and botched construction work. These incidents include filling a bayou in his home and filling wetlands in Panama City Beach; the latter drew a $23,000 fine from the EPA. Finch has drawn nearly $2 million in fines. Finch won a $1.7 million contract in the 1990s to build a pipeline across St. Andrew Bay that would carry away sewage from a nearby paper mill. After construction of the pipeline began, the pipe began to be built above ground, which was a violation of requirements set forth by the Department of Environmental Protection (10 feet below channel depth or 4 feet below the mudline) to prevent a dredge or anchor from breaking the pipe. Finch received a notice of non-compliance on May 25, 2000, but Finch and Phoenix were eventually cleared of responsibility after the work was corrected in 2005.http://www.baylifemagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do;_pdf=1&id;=213 In 2009, Finch and Phoenix were fined for allowing stormwater runoff to pollute creeks and wetlands near Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. Finch was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for permit violations in 2010, and the incident led to suits filed between Finch and the airport authority. NASCAR Finch began his racing team with driver Jeff Purvis in dirt oval track racing. He moved to NASCAR in 1989 in the Busch Series and then Winston Cup Series racing. Phoenix Racing fielded a single entry, numbered 51 and 09, on a mostly part-time basis in the Cup Series throughout its history before going full-time in its final years, and was known for its sponsorship from Miccosukee resorts. The team scored one win in the Cup Series, the 2009 Aaron's 499 won by Brad Keselowski. Finch announced in 2013 that he was leaving the sport after failing to find consistent sponsorship for the past three seasons. He sold the team to Harry Scott Jr., of Turner Scott Motorsports, who took over at the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond. In 2014, Finch partnered with the renamed HScott Motorsports to field an entry in the Daytona 500 for Bobby Labonte, with Labonte driving to a 15th-place finish. Later in the year, Finch funded sponsorship worth at least US$25,000 for Phil Parsons Racing's No. 98 car at Daytona in July, endorsing the Florida gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Charlie Crist. The decals were removed out of respect for PPR partner Mike Curb, a Republican former lieutenant governor of California. The relationship between Finch and Crist generated additional controversy when Crist was found to be using Finch's private Cessna plane en route to a global warming lecture. Finch returned to NASCAR sponsorship in 2015, when Phoenix Construction sponsored the No. 98 for the Daytona 500. However, the car suffered an electrical failure prior to its Budweiser Duel race and failed to qualify. Phoenix Construction would sponsor Stefan Parsons, son of Phil, in multiple Truck races across 2018‚Äì2020. In 2020, Finch partnered with former Truck Series team owners Billy Ballew (Billy Ballew Motorsports) and Richie Wauters (Wauters Motorsports) to field a ride for Erik Jones at Homestead‚ÄìMiami Speedway. The effort was spurred by a bounty from Kevin Harvick and Marcus Lemonis for full-time Cup drivers who could beat Kyle Busch in a Truck race.

In 1969, Windecker won Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the first-ever all-composite (fiberglass epoxy resin) airplane, the single-engine Windecker Eagle. Early flight testing Initial tests of composite wings on conventional airplane bodies began in 1958. Full FAA-supervised structural and flight testing began in 1961. In 1965, the company delivered a pair of composite wings to Cessna Aircraft Company, where they were subjected to structural and flight testing on a Cessna 182.Dr. Leo Windecker, personal recollection Results proved promising,However, the relatively thin fiberglass skins on those wings (designed as direct replacement for the all-aluminum wings of the Cessna 182 testbed) showed greater deformation under load than the aluminum skins so the company built an experimental prototype of all-composite aircraft, the Windecker ACX-7 Eagle. Designed by Dr. Leo Windecker and his wife, Dr. Fairfax Windecker (also a dentist), the aircraft was molded from a unidirectional fiberglass called Fibaloy. The fuselage was made in two halves in full-size female molds and joined on the centerline, much as a model kit might be assembled; the wings were full-core foam around a tubular fiberglass fuel tank, with wing skins formed in full-size female molds. The first prototype, constructed in the Midland research center, flew in October 1967. Eagle prototype The certification Eagle prototype, incorporating retractable landing gear, crashed during spin testing for certification by the Federal Aviation Administration. After a redesign of the empennage, the Eagle AC-7 became the first composite airplane to receive FAA certification, in December 1969. (A number of composite sailplane designs had been certified by the FAA as early as 1967).e.g., FAA Type Certificate G12EU, Glasflugel H-301 Libelle, 31 May 1967 Windecker went on to produce six civilian Eagles in the early 1970s. The Eagle was faster than the high-performance airplanes it was designed to compete against. With the same gross weight (3,400 lbs), wing area (176 sq ft) and engine (285 hp Continental IO-520) as its competitors, the Eagle prototype was emblazoned with silhouettes of a Beech Bonanza, Cessna 210, and Bellanca Viking, testimony to outrunning those airplanes in side-by-side tests.Flying Magazine, May 1970 Windecker results of back-to-back flight tests showed the Eagle to be 10 mph (16 km/h) faster than the Beech V35 Bonanza, even though it was almost 11 inches wider and over longer. This speed advantage was due primarily to the optimum aerodynamic contours of the molded composite airframe. Additionally, the rigid sandwich-construction of its composite material skins prevented wrinkling and buckling under loads (a common occurrence with the thin aluminum skins of metal aircraft) which causes additional parasitic drag. The Eagle's low aspect ratio (of 5.82) rectangular wing, chosen for docile low-speed handling, probably reduced the Eagle's top speed. In 1970, a tapered, higher aspect ratio wing was under development that was calculated to add 10 miles per hour to the Eagle's maximum speed.Ted Windecker, personal recollection Because of its unfamiliarity with composites, the Federal Aviation Agency required the Eagle be 20% stronger than airplanes made with aluminum. This resulted in the Eagle being heavier than its non- composite competitors. The retractable-gear Eagle is no heavier than current production fixed-gear composite airplanes, such as the Cirrus SR22 and Cessna (formerly Columbia) 350, both certified in 1998. Stealth technology proposed Dr. Windecker believed that composite aircraft construction had a ready military application, because composites are nearly invisible to conventional radar systems. In 1962, he and Dow Chemical Company proposed a radar-invisible airplane to the Kennedy Administration, who showed no apparent interest.Leo Windecker, personal recollection 1n 1971, he again proposed a stealth airplane to his congressman, George Mahon (D-Texas). Mahon contacted the Air Force, and a test of Dr. Windecker's personal Windecker Eagle was conducted against an Air Force radar system at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The Air Force reported that the radar registered only the engine and the landing gear, not the plane's composite body. An Eagle, modified to reduce radar, infrared, acoustic and visual observables, was tested by the U.S. Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 1972 under the code name CADDO. The results were compelling, prompting the U.S. Air Force and DARPA to order an Eagle built from scratch to minimize radar detectability. Windecker built Eagle serial number 9, incorporating numerous modifications to reduce its radar detectability, and delivered it in February 1973 as the YE-5 to the Air Force who tested it secretly for five years at Eglin AFB, Florida. It was then transferred to the Army, who continued testing its stealth application for many years. Eventually, the Army transferred the YE-5 to the Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The YE-5 was destroyed during classified testing in the late 1980s. The Army Aviation Museum received Eagle serial number 5, N4196G, to replace the lost stealth prototype. Eagle N4196G is in storage at Fort Rucker and not on display. Military contracts Windecker Industries continued with military contracts, designing and building the U.S. Air Force Aequare remotely piloted vehicle (now called UAVs) for the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. 36 of the air-launched, 150-lb laser-target- designator UAV were delivered and flown at White Sands, New Mexico in 1975 and 1976. Financial difficulties The company was grossly undercapitalized and struggled financially after running out of money and laying off its almost 300 employees in the fall of 1970. The principal owner and Board Chairman of Windecker Industries, a West Texas oilman and rancher, unwilling to accept the terms of numerous financial offers over the following six years, closed the company in 1976, stopping work on ongoing stealth and UAV projects for Lockheed and the U.S. military. A company restart attempt was made in 1977 by Gerry Dietrick, owner of Eagle N4198G, who attempted to buy the rights and tooling, but no more aircraft were constructed. Gerry Dietrick set five trans- Atlantic world speed records in his Eagle, including New York to Paris, besting the previous record holder, a Beechcraft Bonanza, by 13 miles per hour. Achievements Leo Windecker received twenty-two U.S. patents (and many more foreign patents) for all aspects of composite aircraft construction, most of which were assigned to the Dow Chemical Company, which funded the research. This technology was licensed to other firms such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop and the DeLorean Motor Company. In 2003, Leo Windecker was inducted into the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame, and he has been nominated for the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Windecker Eagle N4197G (S/N 006) was donated to the National Air and Space Museum in 1985; it waits in storage, although it is planned to be put on display in the museum's new Udvar-Hazy facility at the Dulles Airport. In October 2008 NASA officials inadvertently displayed the aircraft in the background of a number of photographs published on the web while they uncrated some of the Apollo heat shields. Leo Windecker's Eagle, N4195G (S/N 004), is on display in the Lake Jackson Historical Society Museum in Lake Jackson, Texas . Dr. Windecker died on 13 February 2010, at Cedar Park, Texas.Aviation Week & Space Technology, 22 February 2010, p. 44 In May 2000, the editors of Air & Space Magazine selected the Windecker Eagle as their choice for the best aviation idea that was ‚Äúahead of its time.‚Äù See also * Windecker Eagle * Windecker E-5  References  * Windecker, Dr. Leo.

The movement was a response to federal immigration policies that made obtaining asylum difficult for Central Americans.Rabben, Linda. \\"Sanctuary and Asylum: A Social and Political History.\\" University of Washington Press. 2016. See also Hilary Cunningham. God and Caesar at the Rio Grande: Sanctuary and the Politics of Religion. University of Minnesota Press, 1995. At its peak, Sanctuary involved over 500 congregations in the United States, which, by declaring themselves official \\"sanctuaries,\\" committed to providing shelter, protection, material goods and often legal advice to Central American refugees. Various denominations were involved, including Lutherans, United Church of Christ, Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Jews, Unitarian Universalists, Quakers, and Mennonites. Movement members acted both in defiance of federal laws (civil disobedience) and as citizens upholding laws they thought their government was violating (civil initiative). Several prominent Sanctuary figures were arrested and put on trial in the mid 1980s, including its two \\"founders\\", John Fife and James A. Corbett. The movement's historical roots derive from the right of sanctuary in medieval law and Jewish and Christian social teachings. Its contemporary roots derive from the American Civil War and its Underground Railroad as well as the sanctuaries offered to conscientious objectors during the Vietnam War.Ann Crittenden, Sanctuary: A Story of American Conscience and Law in Collision (Grove, 1988); Cunningham, Hilary. God and Caesar at the Rio Grande: Sanctuary and the Politics of Religion (University of Minnesota Press, 1995). History = Central American Conflict = Between 1980 and 1991, nearly a million Central Americans crossed the U.S. border seeking asylum. Most were fleeing political repression and violence caused by civil wars in Guatemala and El Salvador; others had fled Nicaragua in the wake of the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution. In El Salvador, the military had killed over 10,000 people by 1980, including Archbishop √ìscar Romero and four U.S. churchwomen. In Guatemala, government- backed paramilitary groups killed 50,000, disappeared 100,000 and perpetrated 626 village massacres.\\"Sanctuary Movement ‚Äì Immigration and Naturalization Service.\\" Chicago Religious Task Force on Central America. http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/4415/Sanctuary- Movement.html#ixzz0nBkwLtOg. Official policy under the Reagan administration greatly hindered Central Americans from obtaining asylum status. Congress forbade foreign aid to countries committing human rights abuses, and at same time the U.S. provided funds, training and arms to the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments.Coutin, Susan Bibler. The Culture of Protest: Religious Activism and the U.S. Sanctuary Movement. Boulder: Westview Press, 1993. Because admitting these governments' abuses would bar the U.S. from providing further aid, the Reagan administration instead argued that Central Americans were \\"economic migrants\\" fleeing poverty, not governmental repression. Consequently, Central Americans stood little chance in the U.S. immigration system, where asylum is granted based on proof of \\"well-founded fear\\" of persecution. Just before Reagan took office, Congress had passed the Refugee Act, which incorporated this international definition of political asylum into US law, which formerly granted refugee status only to those \\"fleeing Communism.\\" But the Reagan administration retained discretion under the law and prevented the legal recognition of Central American claims. Visa approval rates for Guatemalans and Salvadorans hovered somewhere under 3% in 1984, as compared to a 60% approval rate for Iranians, 40% for Afghans fleeing Soviet invasion, 32% for Poles, 12% for Nicaraguans escaping the Sandinistas and 100% for Cubans. In 1983, one Guatemalan was granted asylum in the United States.Press, Robert M. \\"Is it safe for Guatemalan Refugees to return home?\\" Christian Science Monitor. May 30, 1985. \\"Sanctuary Movement.\\" University of Arizona Library Special Collections: Tucson, AZ. Many Central Americans who reached the United States were placed in detention centers and sent home. Many protested this move, claiming that they would face severe dangers upon their return. An American Civil Liberties Union study in 1985 reported that 130 deported Salvadorans were found disappeared, tortured, or killed. = Public sanctuary = The sanctuary movement formed as a reaction to these policies. It originated along the border with Mexico. The first church to declare itself a sanctuary for Central American refugees was Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Arizona. The movement was sparked by the increased appearance of Central Americans at the US-Mexico border. In 1980, Fife, Corbett, Jim Dudley, and other Tucson residents began providing legal, financial and material aid to Central American refugees.For the early history of the Arizona-based US movement see Ann Crittenden, Sanctuary: A Story of American Conscience and Law in Collision (Grove, 1988); Ignatius Bau, This Ground is Holy: Church Sanctuary and Central American Refugees (Paulist 1985). Sanctuary drew on many aspects of Christian theology, but was centered on compassionate concern for those fleeing violent civil wars raging in Guatemala and El Salvador, but who met with routine deportation in the United States. Corbett has said that the tradition of his Quaker faith, and its involvement in the Civil War-era Underground Railroad that assisted fugitive slaves, was in part what compelled him to take action. For others, such as Gary Cook, associate pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church in Massillon, Ohio, merely interacting with desperate families compelled conscientious response: \\"We're a very conservative group of folks politically. But once we encountered the refugees face to face, we couldn't justify not taking them in.\\"McGrath, Ellie. \\"Religion: Bringing Sanctuary to Trial.\\" Time Magazine. October 28, 1985. See also Similarly, Quaker Jim Dudley recalled coming across a man hitchhiking on the side of a road on the outskirts of Tucson. After picking him up, Dudley learned he was a Salvadoran attempting to get to San Francisco. Border Patrol agents stopped the car, identified the man as an illegal alien, and arrested him. The man's distress and the likelihood that he would be summarily deported left Dudley uneasy and prompted him to investigate further.Tomsho, Robert. The American Sanctuary Movement. Texas Monthly Press: Austin. 1987. On March 24, 1982, the second anniversary of Archbishop √ìscar Romero's assassination, John Fife, minister of the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, gained the support of his congregation to declare his church a public sanctuary. Outside its building he posted two banners that read: \\"This is a Sanctuary for the Oppressed of Central America,\\" and \\"Immigration: do not profane the Sanctuary of God.\\"Davidson, Miriam. Convictions of the Hearth: Jim Corbett and the Sanctuary Movement. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ. 1998. Several other churches, synagogues and student groups across the country followed suit, and by 1985 Sanctuary became a national movement with roughly 500 member sites. Movement members likened Sanctuary to the Underground Railroad of the 19th century: Central Americans fled their countries, often under extremely dangerous circumstances, traveled through Mexico and eventually found safe haven in a sanctuary community in the United States or Canada. For example, refugees coming through Tucson came to Nogales, the nearest border town in Mexico, often on foot, and found refuge at El Sanctuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe (Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe) Catholic Church. With help from Padre Ram√≥n Dagoberto Qui√±ones, the head priest at Guadalupe, they traveled a short distance across the border to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, whose steeple was visible from Mexico. There they found shelter, food, legal advice and perhaps a little money. The two churches kept in constant contact, and priests and laypeople traveled frequently between parishes. Over the years of the movement, which was active until 1996, activists developed a number of coordinated routes for transporting people to designated Public Sanctuaries. At first, part of the effort was to get those with credible claims to Canada, whose landed immigrant status became available once a refugee turned him/herself in on Canadian soil. But the U.S. government convinced the new conservative government to tighten the border and exclude more Central American refugees. This led to many more U.S. churches becoming welcoming sanctuaries. Prospective candidates or families were matched by numerous factors with a community that was prepared to house them and assist them to make political statements by recounting their personal history. Those who were not willing to do public speaking, for example, would be matched with a community that was not interested in doing that level of organizing or was in a rural area where little public effort was possible. Volunteers drove refugees to exchange points where they were transported to their next night's lodging until they reached their destination. The system was highly decentralized; despite the pre-organization, it was fairly ad hoc, and different groups found varying methods for providing publicity or secrecy as protection. Once the refugees found safe haven in a Sanctuary, U.S. congregations, student groups and activists often invited Central Americans to share their beliefs and experiences with the community. Refugees were invited to the pulpit to give testimony during services, congregations held special Central American peace nights where stories were shared and information given, and Central Americans and North Americans talked frequently and openly at Bible studies, meetings and rallies. As one congregant of Tucson's Southside Presbyterian Church remembers: > On any given night there might be from two to 25 [refugees] sleeping in the > church. The congregation set up a one-room apartment for them behind the > chapel. When that was full, they slept on foam pads in the Sunday school > wing. The denominational makeup of the movement was diverse, including Presbyterian, Quaker, Unitarian, Catholic, and Jewish congregations. About 10% of the sanctuaries were on university campuses and 1% at seminaries. The following are some official statements issued by major denominations within the U.S.:\\"Denominational Breakdown of Sanctuaries.\\" April 1985. \\"Sanctuary Movement.\\" University of Arizona Library Special Collections: Tucson, AZ. The Presbyterian Church: > The Presbyterian Church recommends that 'That the General Assembly support > congregations and individuals who provide sanctuary to asylum seekers as a > way of showing Christian compassion for them and stressing the need for > change in our government's policies and actions; and that other > congregations be challenged seriously to take this stance.' 1983. The American Lutheran Church: > Resolved, that The American Lutheran Church at its 1984 General Convention > ... offer support and encouragement to congregations that have chosen to > become refugee sanctuaries. 1984. The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.: > Therefore, we commend to American Baptist churches the following: ... that > we respect those churches that, responding to the leading of God's Spirit, > are providing sanctuary for refugees fleeing certain suffering and death in > central America. 1984. The Rabbinical Assembly: > The Rabbinical Assembly endorses the concept of Sanctuary as provided by > synagogues, churches and other communities of faith in the United States. > 1984. Secular groups also embraced the Sanctuary movement, such as Amnesty International, Americas Watch (which later became Human Rights Watch), legal aid groups, liberal members of Congress and student organizations (the University of California was particularly active). Op-eds appeared frequently in major national periodicals such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and Time Magazine. The entire city of Berkeley, California, declared itself a sanctuary. Writer Barbara Kingsolver popularized the movement in her 1998 novel The Bean Trees, in which she gives a fictional account of a sanctuary member housing refugees in her Tucson home. This movement was succeeded in the 2000s by the movement of churches and other houses of worship to shelter immigrants in danger of deportation. The New Sanctuary Movement is a network of houses of worship that facilitates this effort. It allows U.S. officials into Catholic churches without Catholic officials' permission.Philip Marfleet (2011), Understanding 'Sanctuary', Journal of Refugee Studies 24(3). From the late 1980s to the 2000s, there also have been instances of churches providing \\"sanctuary\\" for short periods to migrants facing deportation from Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, the United States, and Canada, among other nations. From 1983 to 2003, Canada experienced 36 sanctuary incidents.See Randy K. Lippert (2005). Sanctuary, Sovereignty, Sacrifice: Canadian Sanctuary Incidents, Power and Law. The New Sanctuary Movement organization estimates that at least 600,000 people in the United States have at least one family member in danger of deportation. The movement was declared a 1984 winner of the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award. = Historical parallels = The Church as a Place of Refuge The Sanctuary movement traced its roots to the ancient Judaic tradition of sanctuary. As movement member Mary Ann Lundy phrased it, \\"The idea comes from the original Judeo-Christian concept of Sanctuary, where persons fleeing the law could go to places of worship and be protected.\\" In the Old Testament, God commanded Moses to set aside cities and places of refuge in Canaan where the persecuted could seek asylum. This concept can also be found in ancient Roman law, medieval canon law and British common law. Movement members also appealed to U.S. history, including the abolitionist movement, the Underground Railroad, the housing of Jews during World War II, the idea of the U.S. as a safe haven for immigrants and the civil rights struggles of the 1960s. For Sanctuary congregations, this justified violating federal law, and many members saw themselves as part of a larger transnational community. As Corbett wrote in 1983: > Because the refugees are here, a new exodus has already begun. Those > enforced exiles are being joined by North American religious people who are > voluntarily exiling themselves from a civil law without justice. > Undocumented refugees and outlawed Christians and Jews are together forming > a new exodus community that takes seriously a God who acts in history. > Public sanctuary is an act that refuses to leave foreign policy to > ambassadors and generals and compassion to the limits of law. The new exodus > community is beginning to live a love that demands justice and acts with the > power and authority that love carries. It is an authority rooted deep in > Judeo-Christian tradition and US history itself.O'Brian, William. \\"From > Charity to Solidarity.\\" Chicago Religious Task Force. \\"Sanctuary Movement.\\" > University of Arizona Library Special Collections: Tucson, AZ.  The Sanctuary Trials  The Immigration and Naturalization Service Agency (INS) decided to crack down on movement members by the mid-1980s, which culminated in a series of high-profile trials in Texas and Arizona. In 1985, the INS launched a ten-month investigation dubbed Operation Sojourner, sending paid informants into sanctuary communities to gain the trust of members, find information and report back to federal officials. In 1985, the government initiated criminal prosecutions against two activists in the Rio Grande Valley‚ÄîCatholic layman Jack Elder and Methodist Stacey Merkt, both of whom provided sanctuary to Central Americans at Casa √ìscar Romero in Brownsville, Texas.\\"Informer's 'friendship' with refugees is latest in list of history's betrayals.\\" The Arizona Republic. May 24, 1985. University of Arizona Library Special Collections: Tucson, AZ. In 1986, in the more publicized of the two cases, the Justice Department indicted sixteen U.S. and Mexican religious on 71 counts of conspiracy and encouraging and aiding \\"illegal aliens to enter the United States by shielding, harboring and transporting them.\\" This group of indictees included Father Qui√±ones from Our Lady Church in Nogales, Catholic Reverend Anthony Clark, Jim Corbett, John Fife, Sister Darlene Nicgorski, and a handful of other Sanctuary members and lay religious from participating churches. In what became known as \\"The Sanctuary Trials,\\" the defendants called upon their rights protected under both the U.S. Constitution and international law. They employed First Amendment free exercise claims, arguing they were simply living out their faith by providing refuge to their fellow brethren in need; this was the call of the Gospel and an exercise of their religion. As Sister Nicgorski stated on the day of her arraignment, \\"If I am guilty of anything, I am guilty of the gospel.\\" Defendants referenced passages in the Old and New Testaments, such as Leviticus 19:34 (\\"The stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself) and the story of Exodus (\\"What answer is there for the envoys of the nation? This: that the Lord has fixed Zion in her place, and the afflicted among God's people shall take refuge there\\" [Isaiah 14:32]). The defense also called upon international law to defend their actions. They argued that the U.S. administration's policy towards Central Americans violated the 1980 Refugee Act, a U.S. law enacted under Carter that reflected international norms set down in the 1951 U.N. Convention and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The Sanctuary Trials spurred public outcry from many sympathetic to the movement. Demonstrations at INS facilities were held in San Francisco, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, New York City, and Tucson, among other places. Though the court did find eight movement members guilty on alien smuggling charges, most received suspended sentences or underwent short house arrests. Supported by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a broad coalition of eight religious organizations also eventually brought suit against the U.S. Attorney General and head of the INS. Plaintiffs alleged, among other claims, that defendants violated domestic and international laws and movement members' First Amendment rights of free exercise. While the courts ruled in this case, American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, that international law did not apply and the government did not violate Sanctuary members' First Amendment rights, the movement won the public's sympathies and the government eventually granted asylum status to many of the refugees involved in the trial. Furthermore, many Congressional Democrats took up the cause of the Central American refugees‚Äîdue in large part to the lobbying and publicity efforts of Sanctuary members. In 1990, the House and Senate approved a bill granting temporary protected status (TPS) to Central Americans in need of safe haven, but not until the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act did Congress allow fleeing Central Americans to apply for permanent residence.Gzesh, Susan. \\"Central Americans and Asylum Policy n the Reagan Era.\\" Migration Information Source. 2006. http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=384.

It is considered to be a subspecies of Gallotia simonyi, Simony's lizard. The subspecies was once present throughout much of the island and on the small offshore , but is now confined to a few small areas of cliff with sparse vegetation. It is currently restricted to the southern end of the Risco de Tibataje in , located between Guinea and the so- called Paso del Pino (an area of about four hectares). The species was also successfully reintroduced to the Roque Chico de Salmor in 1999, and subsequent reintroductions have taken place at Julan and at la Dehesa.(Miras & P√©rez- Mellado 2005b) About long, the Hierro giant lizard is a thickset reptile with a broad head. Adults are dark grey to brown in colour, with two rows of pale orange patches running along its sides. Its belly is mostly brown, but has an orange to red colouration towards the middle. Older El Hierro giant lizards are mainly black with some grey. Males are larger than females. It is the animal symbol of the island of El Hierro. The Hierro giant lizard is omnivorous. It eats plants - notably verode and Lavandula abrotanoides - as well as insects (ARKive 2006). Mating begins in May and 5 to 13 eggs are laid from June until the end of August. Their eggs hatch after 61 days. Status and conservation In 1974, the German amateur herpetologist Werner Bings discovered a surviving population of this species on El Hierros mainland (B√∂hme & Bings 1975). This was subsequently determined to be a distinct subspecies, 100 years after the species was first described (L√≥pez-Jurado 1989). The population of this species is about 300 to 400 animals in the wild (including re-introduced populations), and it is classified as critically endangered by the 2006 IUCN Red List. This giant lizard's major threat is predation by feral cats, and possibly also by dogs and rats. A recovery plan for the Hierro giant lizard has been developed and the United Nations and the Canary Islands Autonomous Government funded a program for the captive breeding and re-introduction of the Hierro giant lizard to its original natural habitat, including the Roque Chico de Salmor. Control of feral cats has been stopped in 2002, but according to the IUCN continued control of feral cats should be resumed to allow population recovery. The Hierro giant lizard is protected by national and international legislation. It is listed on Annex IV of the European Union's Habitats Directive (EC 2003) and on Appendix I of CITES.

Founder Andrew P. Hill‚Äôs goal was to preserve the old-growth forest that became Big Basin Redwoods State Park, the first California state park in 1902. Sempervirens Fund's mission is to protect and permanently preserve coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forests, wildlife habitat, watersheds, and other important natural features of California's Santa Cruz Mountains, and to encourage people to appreciate and enjoy this environment. Sempervirens Fund does this by purchasing land for protection and transferring it to state or local agencies. Sempervirens Fund has also worked to establish conservation easements and trail linkages between parks and coastal marine preserves. As of 2013, Sempervirens Fund has saved more than 34,000 acres of redwood lands.  History  In 1899, San Jose photographer Andrew P. Hill was on assignment in Northern California's Santa Cruz Mountains. His photographs were to accompany a news story about a recent fire in the redwoods that had been put out using wine from a local vineyard. While Hill was photographing a very large redwood tree, the owner of the grove stopped him, accused Hill of trespassing and demanded the negatives. Hill refused, and though he hadn't thought of himself as a conservationist, returned to San Jose and started a campaign to save the coast redwoods of the Santa Cruz Mountains and make them accessible to the public. At the time, logging of the coast redwoods was moving at a frantic pace to meet the demand for redwood lumber to build the new towns and cities of a booming California. Concerned that the redwood trees of the Santa Cruz Mountains would be lost forever, Hill, with the help of Stanford University's President David Starr Jordan, convened a meeting of scientists and other influential people at the Stanford University Library to discuss what could be done to protect the redwoods. At this meeting, a surveying committee was appointed, headed by Hill and Carrie Stevens Walter from the San Jose Woman's Club. They went camping along the banks of Sempervirens Creek in what is now Big Basin Redwoods State Park and then there formed the Sempervirens Club. The Club committed to lobby for the protection of the redwoods and for the creation of a public park at Big Basin. They passed a hat, collected $32 to finance their efforts, and launched a fundraising and lobbying campaign to achieve their goal. For over two years, the Sempervirens Club members campaigned for the creation of a state redwood park in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Skillful lobbying by Hill, Santa Clara College (now Santa Clara University) President Father Robert Kenna, S.J., San Francisco attorney D.M. Delmas, and Harry Wells, editor of the San Jose Mercury News, convinced the California Legislature to pass a bill in 1901 allowing for the creation of the park. In 1902 the efforts of the Sempervirens Club paid off; the state acquired 3,800 acres of ancient redwood forests in Big Basin for the people of California ‚Äî preserving coast redwoods for the first time, anywhere. California Redwood Park, later named Big Basin Redwoods State Park, was the first park established in California in the current state park system. The Sempervirens Club continued to work to protect other redwood forest lands adjacent to Big Basin. The club envisioned the establishment of a much ‚Äúgreater park‚Äù that substantially expanded the boundaries of Big Basin. Their goals included acquiring the privately owned parcels within the natural boundaries of the Big Basin area and extending the park westward to the coast so that Big Basin would become, in the words of Andrew P. Hill, ‚Äúone great playground for the people of California and the world.‚Äù By 1968, Big Basin Redwoods State Park was indeed a great recreation area that received high public use. More than 7,000 campers had been turned away the previous year for lack of room. At the same time, the area was being threatened with severe ecological damage from subdivision and development on over 750 acres of private land in key locations within the boundaries of the Waddell Creek watershed. Recognizing that Big Basin would remain threatened unless the greater regional ecology was preserved, a group of local conservationists, including Tony Look, Dorothy Varian, Howard King, George Collins, and Doris Leonard, joined together to work toward protecting the entire Waddell Creek watershed and establishing a new state park at Castle Rock, 14 miles northeast of Big Basin. The group renewed the charter of the original Sempervirens Club and changed the name to Sempervirens Fund to reflect its new emphasis as a fundraising organization. Castle Rock State Park was successfully completed in 1968. In 1976, the fund acquired 1,600-acre Rancho del Oso at Waddell Beach, preserving the Waddell Creek watershed and transferring the property to expand Big Basin Redwoods State Park.  Recent Efforts Through the years, the redwood conservation movement has grown considerably but Sempervirens Fund remains the only organization devoted exclusively to permanently protecting the coast redwood forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Sempervirens Fund's largest transaction ‚Äì acquisition of the 8,532-acre CEMEX property near the town of Davenport ‚Äì was completed in 2011 in partnership with the Land Trust of Santa Cruz County, The Nature Conservancy, Peninsula Open Space Trust, and Save the Redwoods League. Sempervirens Fund continues to protect redwood forest lands in the Santa Cruz Mountains, providing critical habitat, watershed protection, and opportunities for public recreation and inspiration. Sempervirens Fund's guiding vision is to create a ‚ÄúGreat Park‚Äù ‚Äì an area of protected lands spanning San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Santa Clara Counties. The Great Park would connect Big Basin Redwoods, Butano, Portola Redwoods, A√±o Nuevo, and Castle Rock State Parks, along with Pescadero Creek County Park, Long Ridge, and Saratoga Gap Open Space Preserves, Sanborn County Park, Coast Dairies, Wilder Ranch, and Henry Cowell State Park.

He was created D.D. in 1676 by royal mandate, and was twice (in 1679 and 1695) vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. In 1670 he had published anonymously a humorous satire entitled The Ground and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy enquired into in a letter to R. L., which excited much attention and provoked several replies, one of them being from John Owen. These were met by Some Observations, etc., in a second letter to R. L. (1671), written in the same bantering tone as the original work. Eachard attributed the contempt into which the clergy had fallen to their imperfect education, their insufficient incomes, and the want of a true vocation. His descriptions, which were somewhat exaggerated, were largely used by Macaulay in his History of England. He gave amusing illustrations of the absurdity and poverty of the current pulpit oratory of his day, some of them being taken from the sermons of his own father. He attacked the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes in his Mr. Hobbs State of Nature considered; in a dialogue between Philautus and Timothy (1672), and in his Some Opinions of Mr.. Hobbs considered in a second dialogue (1673). These were written in their author's chosen vein of light satire, and John Dryden praised them as highly effective within their own range. Eachard's own sermons, however, were not superior to those he satirized. Jonathan Swift alludes to him as a signal instance of a successful humorist who entirely failed as a serious writer. A collected edition of his works in three volumes, with a notice of his life, was published in 1774. The Contempt of the Clergy was reprinted in E. Arbors English Garner. A Free Enquiry into the Causes of the very great Esteem that the Nonconforming Preachers are generally in with their Followers (1673) has been attributed to Eachard on insufficient grounds.

It is being built by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to provide New York City with a third connection to its upstate water supply. Water Tunnel No. 3 is the largest capital construction project in New York City history. The tunnel will be more than long, travel below street level in sections, and will cost over $6 billion. Construction began in 1970 and is expected to be completed in 2020. The tunnel will serve as a backup to Water Tunnel No. 1, completed in 1917, and Water Tunnel No. 2, completed in 1936. Stages = One = The project was authorized in 1954 and was imagined as \\"the greatest nondefense construction project in the history of Western Civilization\\". The city determined that it needed a third water tunnel so that Tunnels 1 and 2 could be closed for inspection and repairs. Stage One construction of Tunnel 3 began in 1970 and completed in 1993. This portion was put into service in 1998 and cost about $1 billion. This first section was bored through bedrock between underground, using drilling and blasting techniques. Section one is long and starts at Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, New York then crosses under Central Park in Manhattan, to reach Fifth Avenue at 78th Street. From there it runs under the East River and Roosevelt Island into Astoria, Queens. It is a concrete-lined tunnel that is in diameter and reduces to in diameter before connecting to 14 vertical shafts. =Two= Stage Two was built using tunnel boring machines and comprises two sections. The Brooklyn and Queens section runs and begins in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where it connects to the Richmond Tunnel for Staten Island. It passes through Park Slope, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Bushwick before reaching Maspeth, Queens. From Maspeth it runs through Woodside and Astoria, where it connects to the end of the Stage One section. The Brooklyn section is in diameter, and the Queens section is .water- technology.net The Manhattan section is in diameter and runs for . It begins at a valve chamber in Central Park, runs south along the west side of Manhattan, and curves around the southern end of the island to come partway through the Lower East Side. A spur of the Manhattan tunnel begins on the west side at approximately 34th Street, goes to the east side and then turns north under Second Avenue to about 59th Street. The tunnel itself was completed in 2008, and after the construction of riser shafts was completed, the tunnel opened in 2013. =Three= What used to be called Stage Three is now being referred to as a separate project, the \\"Kensico‚ÄìCity Tunnel\\". It will be in diameter, running from the Kensico Reservoir in Westchester to the Van Cortlandt Valve Chamber complex in the Bronx. =Four= Stage Four is a proposed tunnel that would start at the Hillview Reservoir, pass through the eastern Bronx and then through Queens, where it would eventually meet the Stage Two section. Valve chambers The largest valve chamber is in Van Cortlandt Park. It is built below the park surface. When completed it will control the flow of water from the city's Catskill and Delaware systems. These systems provide 90 percent of the city's current drinking water. The Van Cortlandt Park Valve Chamber is long, wide and high. The complex has nine vertical shafts; and two manifolds. Each manifold is long and in diameter and is projected to be finished in 2020. Deaths Since 1970, when construction on the tunnel began, twenty-four people have died in construction-related accidents. The deaths have included twenty-three workers and a 12-year-old boy, Don-re Carroll, who died while exploring uncapped water pipes in the Bronx. No deaths have occurred since 1997. Progress In 2002, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg made completion of the tunnel a priority, and set a goal date of 2021. A New York Times report in 2016 stated that mayor Bill de Blasio was postponing completion of the project indefinitely, but he subsequently stated that this was a miscommunication between his press office and the Times, and that the completion date was actually being pushed up to 2020.

Fueled by Benzedrine, Greene wrote it in six weeks.Bergonzi, A Study in Greene, p. 69 To avoid distraction, he rented a room in Bloomsbury from a landlady who lived in an apartment below him. He used that apartment in the novel (it's where D. hides for a day) and had an affair with the landlady's daughter.West, The Quest for Graham Greene, p. 87 He wrote the book for moneyReid, Movie Mystery and Suspense, p. 81 and was so displeased with his work that he wanted it published under a pseudonym.West, op cit, p. 87, 91 But critics took a far different view; The New York Times, for example, called the novel \\"a magnificent tour-de-force.\\"Greene: An Annotated Bibliography, p.22 Plot summary D, a former university professor from the Continent who speaks English, is sent by his government, two years into a vicious civil war, on a secret mission to buy coal in England. Traumatised by the war, in which his wife was executed in error and he was buried alive in an air raid, England to him is a place of peace and happy memories. On the ferry he sees L, an aristocratic supporter of the right-wing rebels, and Rose, a bold and wilful English girl. Waiting for the train to London, Rose tells D she is the estranged daughter of Lord Benditch, the mineowner whom D has come to negotiate with. Impatient, she hires a car and offers D a lift, but when they stop at a hotel a man in the washroom tries to rob D. Deciding to drive on alone, he is followed by L, whose chauffeur beats him up and leaves him by the roadside. They do not find the government documents D had hidden in his shoe. Hitching a lift to London, D follows instructions by booking into a seedy hotel, where he befriends the 14-year-old maid Else and persuades her to hide his documents in her stocking. Then he goes to meet his contact K, who works at a language school teaching an invented language called Entrenationo (obviously modelled on Esperanto). Back at his hotel, Rose rings and asks him to meet her, but on his way a bullet misses him. Returning to the spot with Rose, she finds the bullet and realises he is in mortal danger. Telling her about his work before the war as one of the world's leading experts on the Chanson de Roland, the two become closer. Retrieving his documents from Else next day, he goes to see Lord Benditch and his fellow directors, one of whom is Forbes, informally engaged to Rose. They are ready to do a deal and ask for his documents, which he discovers have been lifted from him on the way in by Benditch's butler. Dismissed, on his way out he sees L going in to talk to the mineowners. Rose comes in and gets Forbes to come with her to D's embassy, where she thinks he will be authenticated. The official they see, a supporter of the rebels, claims that D is dead, pulls out a gun and calls the police. They question D about the death of Else, thrown from an upper window of the hotel. Enraged that an innocent girl has been killed, D grabs the gun and, evading pursuit, breaks into an empty flat. Convinced that K is not only working for the rebels but is also a murderer, he takes him at gunpoint from the language school to the flat he has found. In the bathroom he shoots at him, but misses. Rose knocks on the outside door, having tracked him down, and they discover K has died of shock. The two admit that they have fallen in love, but she is meant to be marrying Forbes and he has to try and save his mission. In a final effort to stop the deal with L, he takes a train to the Midlands town where Benditch's mine is and attempts to dissuade the workers by telling them where the coal is going. They put work ahead of solidarity. Some teenagers he befriends want to blow up the mine and he helps them, but is knocked out by the blast and taken back to London by the police. Released on bail thanks to lawyers engaged by Forbes, he learns that the firm now think it too dangerous to sell coal to the rebels and have cancelled the deal with L. Realising where Rose's affections have gone, Forbes renounces her and agrees to drive D to the south coast, where he is taken out to a ship that is heading home. On the ship he finds Rose. Altogether, D. has failed in his primary mission ‚Äì to procure British coal for his own side ‚Äì but at least managed to deny it to his foes.  Setting  \\"D\\", a patriot from a country suffering a civil war, is in England to secure a contract with coal magnate Lord Benditch that will greatly assist the faltering loyalist cause. His country is nameless and the details of its history, geography, and current politics remain vague. However, the reader could have little doubt ‚Äì and Greene himself admitted as muchGraham Greene on The Confidential Agent ‚Äì that the Spanish Civil War was his main inspiration for the book's depiction of a left-leaning, popular revolutionary republic. Like Spain, the country in The Confidential Agent is embroiled internally in bitter factional fights while fighting a brutal civil war and a land-owning aristocracy determined to destroy the republic to regain its centuries-old privileged position. Underscoring the Spanish connection, in the novel's final section, a ship travelling from England to the unnamed country must sail westward in the Channel and then cross the Bay of Biscay. Themes D is a man of peace, a university intellectual who values truth and honour. For the sake of his mission he initially accepts insults and beatings, until a turning point occurs. After all the injustices he has suffered, back in his home country and then in England, he becomes a solitary instrument of justice. Without promoting a left-wing agenda, Greene shows a distaste for the authoritarian militaristic regime of the Nationalists in Spain and, readers then would quickly have made the connection, that of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. England by contrast, though often humdrum and uninspiring, is at peace under the rule of law. Greene emphasises the horrors of modern war, in particular the physical and mental effects of bombing on civilian populations. Jews, for Forbes is Jewish, are portrayed as different from English or Spaniards. As in Stamboul Train, Greene uses a rich and sensual older Jewish man who fails to win the young Gentile girl he wants. In the end, however, a weeping Forbes rises above his self-interest. Literary resonances are explicitly and covertly included, for Greene sought to ... create something legendary out of a contemporary thriller. The Chanson de Roland is used by D and Rose as a yardstick for measuring heroic or treacherous behaviour, while Rose's r√¥le as a mysterious helper to the hero reprises that of princesses like Ariadne and Medea. Greene saw D and Forbes as medieval knights, equally chivalrous in their actions. Adaptations The novel was also the basis for the 1945 film Confidential Agent, starring Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre. In the book, the nationality of the agent is not stated; in the film, he is Spanish.

It forms part of the Clayton-le-Woods civil parish, and is in the Clayton-le-Woods North ward of the borough of Chorley. Lying next to the industrial estate of Walton Summit, one-time terminus of a branch of the Lancaster Canal, it also neighbours Clayton Green, Hoghton and Brindle, and is not far from the small town of Bamber Bridge. Clayton Brook Village as it is often termed, is bounded by the A6 road and the M61 and M65 motorways, and is conveniently near the M6 motorway. History The highest land point of the Clayton Brook estate found in the playing fields between Woodfield, Croft Meadow and Carr Barn Brow is the previous summit site of the now defunct Walton Summit stretch of the Lancaster Canal. The canal summit was once linked to the Preston terminus of the said canal via the Lancaster Canal Tramroad. The demise of this stretch was brought on by the onset of the M61 that now runs alongside Clayton Brook at its eastern edge. Reminders of the area's navigable past remain however, with the nearby Tramway Lane linking the estate to junction 2 of the M65 and 9 of the M61. Bridge 10 of the canal stretch also remains, albeit ruined and amongst overgrowth, It ran up behind Woodfield where skate board hill is now, that was the tramway with the terminus at the top near Carr Barn Brow where now stand Briary Court, in nearby farmland across the motorway from the summit.H. Potter, The Last Boat to Walton Summit, Pp. 96-98 (Lancashire Canal Trust, 2008) The whole area was once owned by Hoghton Tower, which was a major landowner in the Chorley and South Ribble areas. Clayton Brook was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Central Lancashire New Town Development Corporation, which also developed the Walton Summit industrial estate nearby. It was affected by the recession in the late 1980s to early 1990s. May 2013 was when the Clayton Brook pub started to be knocked down. Also in 2013 Clayton Brook/Community House won Community Futures for being the best self developed community out of 39 organisations in the Central Lancashire area. Transport Clayton Brook is served by two bus routes: the frequent 125 service operated by Stagecoach between Preston and Bolton and the 114 service between Leyland and Chorley. Housing There is a good mix of residential properties. Approximately half the 4,000 plus properties are rented, with the landlord now being the housing association group Places for People. Clayton Brook was originally built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The new village green where the Clayton Brook pub used to be Amenities It hosts several primary schools, including Clayton Brook Primary School, Westwood Primary School and St Bede's Primary School. Although Westwood Primary School and St Bede's actually fall under Clayton-le- Woods. There are three churches in the parish of Clayton Brook, one being Clayton Brook Community Church across from the village centre. The other being St Bede's and St John the Evangelist in Whittle-le-Woods, The village centre is only 10 minutes walk from the large Asda supermarket in Clayton Green. The local wildlife preserve is Cuerden Valley Park (the grounds of Cuerden Hall) - and there are several public footpaths within the vicinity taking walkers to a variety of green destinations. Community BBQ & Disco 30 June 2013 It also hosts the 1st Clayton Brook Scouts, Cubs, Beavers all in the Clayton Brook Village Hall.

History K&N; air filter (center) and recharge kit K&N; was founded by Ken Johnson and Norm McDonald in 1963. The name K&N; came from the first letters in the founders' first names. Johnson and McDonald sold motorcycles and motorcycle parts and supported a K&N; factory race team. Air filters soon became the primary focus of the company. In the late 1980s, K&N; introduced a bolt-on air intake kit to replace the factory air box and air filter. K&N; also released a line of oil filters with a stamped hex to accept a standard wrench for installation and removal. K&N; has maintained very active involvement in racing and motorsports throughout its history, including the NASCAR Pro Series East and West,NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East and the King of the West 410 Sprint Car Series.Dirt Racing Report, 14 March 2013  Racing  In February 2002, K&N; entered the 24 Hours of Daytona race where up-and- coming driver, Joey Scarallo, was invited to be a driver. Criticism K&N;'s claims for their air filters have been the subject of some controversy, with some 3rd-party tests finding that K&N;'s cotton gauze filters are less efficient and let more dirt into the engine than factory-equipment paper filters, and that they become increasingly restrictive as they are coated with particulates. However, other independent testing has shown that K&N; filters provide a level of protection against particles that is comparable to or better than OEM filters. All standard air filters become more airflow- restrictive as they collect contaminants, but efficiency typically increases for the majority of a filter‚Äôs service life. There are also concerns with oiled air filters being used on modern engines that use MAF sensors; a MAF sensor may get coated by oil and not function as intended. This is in contrast to older engine designs that use carburetors or AFM type sensors.

It provides services, events and activities to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Utah. The center manages annual and ongoing projects including the Utah Pride Festival. History Three LGBT centers were created in Utah from the 1970s through the 1990s. The name of the most recent center, Utah Stonewall Center, has been changed three times since its creation in 1991 as a project of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah. =Gay Community Services Center Inc.= The first LGBT community center in Utah was the Gay Community Services Center Inc. in 1975 through 1979. Its executive directors were Dorothy Makin and Ken Storer. =Gay Community Service Center and Clinic= The Gay Community Service Center and Clinic was created in 1984. Its executive directors were Auntie D√© and Beau Chain√©. =Utah Stonewall Center= The Utah Stonewall Center was created in 1991 through 1996 as a project of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah. The executive directors of the center were Craig Miller, Melissa Sillitoe, John Bennett, Renee Rinaldi, Michael O‚ÄôBrien and Alan Ahtow. =Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Utah= The center was renamed in 1997 through 2004 as the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Utah. Its executive directors were Monique Predovitch, Doug Wortham and Paula Wolfe. =Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Community Center of Utah= The center was renamed in 2003 as the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Community Center of Utah. Its executive directors were Chad Beyer and Valerie A. Larabee. =Utah Pride Center= The center was renamed in 2006 as the Utah Pride Center. Larabee resigned in 2013 as the center executive director after it experienced struggles with financial and leadership issues, and its staffers assumed her duties until a new executive director was appointed. Center Treasurer Steven Ha was appointed in 2014 to serve as the center interim executive director, and was later employed for one year as the center executive director. On December 12, 2014, less than a year after his appointment, the Utah Pride Center announced the resignation of Steven Ha due to a recurrence of lymphoma. Marian Edmonds-Allen was named Executive Director in August 2015. Carol Gnade was named Executive Director October 1, 2015 with a mandate to move to a new building. Robert Moolman was named Executive Director May 1, 2018.

Library The Utah Stonewall Library was founded in June 1991 by Robert Smith and Liza Smart, Chairs of the Utah Stonewall Committee of The Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah (GLCCU). It was an integral part of the Utah Stonewall Center from its inception and was established as a community-based information center, dedicated to the promotion of Lesbian and Gay visibility and viability by means of the accumulation of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian and Transgender archives, literature, music, film, art, history, culture, humor, education and fiction - and the dissemination of these materials to the public at large. The selection criteria included authors, stories, characters or titles that are LGBT+ affirming or iconic figures that were influenced by the community. The lending library is based on the honor system and a first name basis, allowing anyone to provide their chosen name/identies and to feel free to study and read topics of their interests free of shame and stigma. In addition, the special collections section included the following Utah Stonewall Historical Society and Archives for Gay and Lesbian Studies, Stonewall Center and Utah Pride Center materials: administrative files, brochures, committee files, contracts, daily office files, financial documents, historical records, manuals, meeting minutes, memorabilia, newsletters, office files, office references, organization files, pamphlets, photos, physical objects, posters, publications and subject files. These library archives have been donated and now reside as the Utah Pride Center (1975-2012) set at the University of Utah, Special Collections, J. Willard Marriott Library. New material up to 2017 exists, but will not be available until indexed. In 1996 the library had reached ~2,000 books -- but a temporary closure resulted in a bulk loss of books and archives. By 2017, the library had once again expanded to ~3,400 books. Primary librarians shaping the permanent/archival lending library include: Robert \\"Bobbie\\" Smith who was the first library director lecturing in gay literature who, during the Utah Beyond Stonewall retreat in 1989, saw the need for an archival lending library; donating the first ~500 books and curating the collection to ~1,000; inspiring others to donate. Ben Williams focused on archives and keeping the collection ordered during his off-time hours from 1993-1994; his community historian skills have expanded the community's knowledge both then and now; he was the first full-time volunteer librarian. Michelle Davies (LS) standardized library practice and policy. Jacob Corbaley curated and maintained the collection. Liz Pitts (MLS) with a professional background in library services recategorized, weeded and cataloged the collection under Library Thing; patronage of the available titles shot up. Daniel Cureton (MLS) for two years was the first paid queer librarian who acquired grants such as the LSTA (Library Services and Technology Act) as funded by IMLS (Institute of Museum and Library Services) and administered by USDL (Utah State Division of Libraries); he expanded the library's mission by building institutional memory, knowledge of the library's past, increasing inclusion and networking resources to other libraries and communities. In 2017, Cureton and UPC executive director Carol Gnade arranged for the Salt Lake City Library to host the lending collection at the Main Library branch. This both made the library available to the public at large as well as saved valuable space at the new UPC location. This arrangement extends to 2022.

It is taken by mouth, by application to the skin, in through the vagina, or by injection into muscle. Side effects of prasterone in women include symptoms of masculinization like oily skin, acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire, headaches, insomnia, and others. The compound is a naturally occurring prohormone of androgens and estrogens and hence is an agonist of the androgen and estrogen receptors, the respective biological targets of androgens like testosterone and estrogens like estradiol. Prasterone also has a variety of activities of its own, including neurosteroid and other activities. Prasterone was discovered in 1934. An association between DHEA levels and aging was first reported in 1965. The compound started being used as a medication in the late 1970s and as a supplement in the early 1980s. The marketing of prasterone over-the-counter as a supplement is allowed in the United States but is banned in many other countries. Medical uses =Deficiency= DHEA and DHEA sulfate are produced by the adrenal glands. In people with adrenal insufficiency such as in Addison's disease, there may be deficiency of DHEA and DHEA sulfate. In addition, levels of these steroids decrease throughout life and are 70 to 80% lower in the elderly relative to levels in young adults. Prasterone can be used to increase DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels in adrenal insufficiency and older age. Although there is deficiency of these steroids in such individuals, clinical benefits of supplementation, if any, are uncertain, and there is insufficient evidence at present to support the use of prasterone for such purposes. =Menopause= Prasterone is sometimes used as an androgen in menopausal hormone therapy. In addition to prasterone itself, a long-lasting ester prodrug of prasterone, prasterone enanthate, is used in combination with estradiol valerate for the treatment of menopausal symptoms under the brand name Gynodian Depot. =Vaginal atrophy= Prasterone, under the brand name Intrarosa, is approved in the United States in a vaginal insert formulation for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/208470s000lbl.pdf The mechanism of action of prasterone for this indication is unknown, though it may involve local metabolism of prasterone into androgens and estrogens. =Sexual desire= Prasterone has been used orally at a dosage of 10 mg/day to increase sexual desire in women. =Childbirth= As the sodium salt of prasterone sulfate (brand names Astenile, Mylis, Teloin),https://www.drugs.com/international/mylis.html an ester prodrug of prasterone, prasterone is used in Japan as an injection for the treatment of insufficient cervical ripening and cervical dilation during childbirth. =Available forms= Prasterone was previously marketed as a pharmaceutical medication under the brand name Diandrone in the form of a 10 mg oral tablet in the United Kingdom. Side effects Prasterone is produced naturally in the human body, but the long-term effects of its use are largely unknown. In the short term, several studies have noted few adverse effects. In a study by Chang et al., prasterone was administered at a dose of 200 mg/day for 24 weeks with slight androgenic effects noted. Another study utilized a dose up to 400 mg/day for 8 weeks with few adverse events reported. A longer-term study followed patients dosed with 50 mg of prasterone for 12 months with the number and severity of side effects reported to be small. Another study delivered a dose of 50 mg of prasterone for 10 months with no serious adverse events reported. As a hormone precursor, there have been reports of side effects possibly caused by the hormone metabolites of prasterone. It is not known whether prasterone is safe for long-term use. Some researchers believe prasterone supplements might actually raise the risk of breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer. Prasterone may increase prostate swelling in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland. Prasterone is a steroid hormone. High doses may cause aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, and the growth of body or facial hair on women. It also may stop menstruation and lower the levels of HDL (\\"good\\" cholesterol), which could raise the risk of heart disease. Other reported side effects include acne, heart rhythm problems, liver problems, hair loss (from the scalp), and oily skin. It may also alter the body's regulation of blood sugar. Prasterone may promote tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. It may also increase the risk of uterine and prostate cancers due to metabolism into estrogens and androgens, respectively. Patients on hormone replacement therapy may have more estrogen-related side effects when taking prasterone. This supplement may also interfere with other medicines, and potential interactions between it and drugs and herbs are possible. Prasterone is possibly unsafe for individuals experiencing pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone sensitive conditions, liver problems, diabetes, depression or mood disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or cholesterol problems. Prasterone has been reported to possess few or no side effects even at very high dosages (e.g., 50 times the recommended over-the- counter supplement dosage). However, it may cause masculinization and other androgenic side effects in women and gynecomastia and other estrogenic side effects in men. Pharmacology Testosterone levels following a single oral dose of 300 mg crystalline (non-micronized) or micronized prasterone (DHEA) in premenopausal women. Estradiol and levels after a single intramuscular injection of Gynodian Depot (4 mg estradiol valerate, 200 mg prasterone enanthate) in women. Prasterone is metabolized into androgens and estrogens in the body. It is transformed into androstenedione by 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ≤-HSD) and into androstenediol by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Œ≤-HSD). Then, androstenedione and androstenediol can be converted into testosterone by 17Œ≤-HSD and 3Œ≤-HSD, respectively. Subsequently, testosterone can be metabolized into dihydrotestosterone by 5Œ±-reductase. In addition, androstenedione and testosterone can be converted into estrone and estradiol by aromatase, respectively. Prasterone is also reversibly transformed into prasterone sulfate by steroid sulfotransferase (specifically SULT1E1 and SULT2A1), which in turn can be converted back into prasterone by steroid sulfatase. The transformation of prasterone into androgens and estrogens is tissue-specific, occurring for instance in the liver, fat, vagina, prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles, among other tissues. In clinical studies of prasterone supplementation, dosages have ranged from 20 to 1,600 mg per day. In people with adrenal insufficiency, oral dosages of 20 to 50 mg/day prasterone have been found to restore DHEA and DHEA-S levels to normal ranges seen in healthy young adults. Conversely, oral dosages of 100 to 200 mg/day prasterone have been found to result in supraphysiological levels of DHEA and DHEA-S. At a high dosage of 1,600 mg/day orally for 4 weeks, treatment of postmenopausal women with prasterone has been found to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, androstenedione, and DHT all by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol both by 2-fold. Micronization of prasterone has been found to significantly increase levels of DHEA-S achieved with oral administration but to produce no significant change in levels of DHEA or testosterone levels achieved. Although prasterone can reliably increase testosterone levels in women, this isn't similarly the case in men. A high dosage of 1,600 mg/day prasterone in men for 4 weeks was found to increase DHEA and androstenedione levels but did not significantly affect testosterone levels. Chemistry Prasterone, also known as androst-5-en-3Œ≤-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol), androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one). Prasterone is the Œ¥5 (5(6)-dehydrogenated) analogue of epiandrosterone (5Œ±-androstan-3Œ≤-ol-17-one), and is also known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone (5-DHEA) or Œ¥5-epiandrosterone. A positional isomer of prasterone which may have similar biological activity is 4-dehydroepiandrosterone (4-DHEA). =Derivatives= Prasterone is used medically as the C3Œ≤ esters prasterone enanthate and prasterone sulfate. The C19 demethyl analogue of prasterone is 19-nordehydroepiandrosterone (19-nor- DHEA), which is a prohormone of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). The 5Œ±-reduced and Œ¥1 (1(2)-dehydrogenated) analogue of prasterone is 1-dehydroepiandrosterone (1-DHEA or 1-androsterone), which is a prohormone of 1-testosterone (Œ¥1-DHT or dihydroboldenone). Fluasterone (3Œ≤-dehydroxy-16Œ±-fluoro-DHEA) is a derivative of prasterone with minimal or no hormonal activity but other biological activities preserved. History DHEA was discovered, via isolation from male urine, by Adolf Butenandt and Hans Dannenbaum in 1934, and the compound was isolated from human blood plasma by Migeon and Plager in 1954. DHEA sulfate, the 3Œ≤-sulfate ester of DHEA, was isolated from urine in 1944, and was found by Baulieu to be the most abundant steroid hormone in human plasma in 1954. From its discovery in 1934 until 1959, DHEA was referred to by a number of different names in the literature, including dehydroandrosterone, transdehydroandrosterone, dehydroisoandrosterone, and androstenolone. The name dehydroepiandrosterone, also known as DHEA, was first proposed by Fieser in 1949, and subsequently became the most commonly used name of the hormone. For decades after its discovery, DHEA was considered to be an inactive compound that served mainly as an intermediate in the production of androgens and estrogens from cholesterol. In 1965, an association between DHEA sulfate levels and aging was reported by De Nee and Vermeulen. Following this, DHEA became of interest to the scientific community, and numerous studies assessing the relationship between DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels and aging were conducted. Prasterone, the proposed and recommended of DHEA and the term used when referring to the compound as a medication, were published in 1970 and 1978, respectively.https://mednet- communities.net/inn/db/media/docs/p-innlist23.pdfhttps://mednet- communities.net/inn/db/media/docs/r-innlist18.pdf The combination of 4 mg estradiol valerate and 200 mg prasterone enanthate in an oil solution was introduced for use in menopausal hormone therapy by intramusuclar injection under the brand name Gynodian Depot in Europe by 1978. In the early 1980s, prasterone became available and was widely sold over-the-counter as a non- prescription supplement in the United States, primarily as a weight loss aid. It was described as a \\"miracle drug\\", with supposed anti-aging, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer benefits. This continued until 1985, when the marketing of prasterone was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to a lack of evidence for health benefits and due to the long-term safety and risks of the compound being unknown at the time. Subsequently, prasterone once again became available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement in the United States following the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Conversely, it has remained banned as a supplement in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2001, Genelabs submitted a New Drug Application of prasterone for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to the FDA. It had the tentative brand names Anastar, Aslera, and Prestara. However, this application was not approved, and while development of prasterone for SLE in both the United States and Europe continued until up to 2010, the medication was ultimately never approved for the treatment of this condition. In 2016, the FDA approved prasterone in an intravaginal gel formulation for the treatment of painful sexual intercourse due to vulvovaginal atrophy in the United States under the brand name Intrarosa. This was the first prasterone-containing medication to be approved by the FDA in this country. Society and culture =Generic names= Prasterone is the generic name of DHEA in English and Italian and its International Nonproprietary Name, United States Adopted Name and Italian Common Name, while its generic name is prasteronum in Latin, prast√©rone in French and its French popular name, and prasteron in German. =Marketing= In the United States, prasterone or prasterone sulfate have been advertised, under the names DHEA and DHEA-S, with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. Prasterone and prasterone sulfate are readily available in the United States, where they are sold as over-the-counter dietary supplements. In 1996, reporter Harry Wessel of the Orlando (Florida) Sentinel wrote about DHEA that \\"Thousands of people have gotten caught up in the hoopla and are buying the stuff in health food stores, pharmacies and mail-order catalogs\\" but that \\"such enthusiasm is viewed as premature by many in the medical field.\\" He noted that \\"National publications such as Time, Newsweek and USA Today have run articles recently about the hormone, while several major publishers have come out with books touting it.\\"\\"Proponents Say DHEA Blunts Effects of Aging,\\" Orlando Sentinel, image 43 His column was widely syndicated and reprinted in other U.S. newspapers. The product was being \\"widely marketed to and used by bodybuilders,\\" Dr. Paul Donahue wrote in 2012 for King Features syndicate.\\"DHEA Supplement a Help or Harm,\\" Kenosha (Wisconsin) News, March 18, 2012, image 17 =Regulation= By country =Australia= In Australia, a prescription is required to buy prasterone, where it is also comparatively expensive compared to off-the-shelf purchases in US supplement shops. Australian customs classify prasterone as an \\"anabolic steroid[s] or precursor[s]\\" and, as such, it is only possible to carry prasterone into the country through customs if one possesses an import permit which may be obtained if one has a valid prescription for the hormone.Therapeutic Goods Administration, Personal Importation Scheme =Canada= In Canada, prasterone is a Controlled Drug listed under Section 23 of Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances ActHealth Canada, DHEA listing in the Ingredient Database and as such is available by prescription only. =United Kingdom= Prasterone is listed as an anabolic steroid and is thus a class C controlled drug. =United States= Prasterone is legal to sell in the United States as a dietary supplement. It is currently grandfathered in as an \\"Old Dietary Ingredient\\" being on sale prior to 1994. Prasterone is specifically exempted from the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 and 2004. Sports and athletics Prasterone is banned from use in athletic competition. It is a prohibited substance under the World Anti-Doping Code of the World Anti-Doping Agency,World Anti-Doping Agency which manages drug testing for Olympics and other sports. * Yulia Efimova, who holds the world record pace for both the 50-meter and 200-meter breaststroke, and won the bronze medal in the 200-meter breaststroke in the 2012 London Olympic Games, tested positive for prasterone in an out-of-competition doping test.Russian Olympic Medal-Winning Swimmer Efimova Fails Doping Test ‚Äì Report * Rashard Lewis, then with the Orlando Magic, tested positive for prasterone and was suspended 10 games before the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season.Memphis Grizzlies' O.

J. Mayo gets 10-game drug suspension, ESPN, January 27, 2011. Mayo was the seventh player to test positive for performance- enhancing drugs since the league began testing in 1999. * Olympic 400-meter champion Lashawn Merritt tested positive for prasterone in 2010 and was banned from the sport for 21 months. * Tennis player Venus Williams had permission from the International Tennis Federation to use DHEA along with hydrocortisone as a treatment for \\"adrenal insufficiency,\\" but it was revoked in 2016 by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which believed DHEA use would enhance Williams' athletic performance.Rebecca R. Ruiz and Ben Rothenberg, \\"Doping,\\" Austin American-Statesman, Texas, September 22, 2016, page C12, from The New York Times Research =Anabolic uses= A meta-analysis of intervention studies shows that prasterone supplementation in elderly men can induce a small but significant positive effect on body composition that is strictly dependent on prasterone conversion into its bioactive metabolites such as androgens or estrogens. Evidence is inconclusive in regards to the effect of prasterone on strength in the elderly. In middle-aged men, no significant effect of prasterone supplementation on lean body mass, strength, or testosterone levels was found in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. =Cancer= There is no evidence prasterone is of benefit in treating or preventing cancer. =Cardiovascular disease= A review in 2003 found the then-extant evidence sufficient to suggest that low serum levels of DHEA-S may be associated with coronary heart disease in men, but insufficient to determine whether prasterone supplementation would have any cardiovascular benefit. Prasterone may enhance G6PD mRNA expression, confounding its inhibitory effects. =Lupus= There is some evidence of short-term benefit in those with systemic lupus erythematosus but little evidence of long-term benefit or safety. Prasterone was under development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States and Europe in the 1990s and 2000s and reached phase III clinical trials and preregistration for this indication, respectively, but ultimately development was not continued past 2010. =Memory= Prasterone supplementation has not been found to be useful for memory function in normal middle aged or older adults. It has been studied as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, but there is no evidence that it is effective. =Mood= A few small, short term clinical studies have found that prasterone improves mood but its long-term efficacy and safety, and how it compares to antidepressants, was unknown as of 2015.

Among the entities benefiting from selling and delivering treatments are pharmaceutical companies, physicians, alternative practitioners and other professional or consumer organizations. It is distinct from the promulgation of bogus or unrecognised diagnoses. Term The term ‚Äúmonger‚Äù has ancient roots, providing the basis for many common compound forms such as cheesemonger, fishmonger, and fleshmonger for those who peddle such wares respectively. ‚ÄúDisease mongering‚Äù as a label for the \\"invention\\" or promotion of diseases in order to capitalize on their treatment was first used in 1992 by health writer Lynn Payer, who applied it to the Listerine mouthwash campaign against halitosis (bad breath). Payer defined disease mongering as a set of practices which include the following: * Stating that normal human experiences are abnormal and in need of treatment * Claiming to recognize suffering which is not present * Defining a disease such that a large number of people have it * Defining a disease's cause as some ambiguous deficiency or hormonal imbalance * Associating a disease with a public relations spin campaign * Directing the framing of public discussion of a disease * Intentionally misusing statistics to exaggerate treatment benefits * Setting a dubious clinical endpoint in research * Advertising a treatment as without side effect * Advertising a common symptom as a serious disease The incidence of conditions not previously defined as illness being medicalised as \\"diseases\\" is difficult to scientifically assess due to the inherent social and political nature of the definition of what constitutes a disease, and what aspects of the human condition should be managed according to a medical model. For example, halitosis, the condition which prompted Payer to coin the phrase \\"disease mongering\\", isn't merely an imagined social stigma but can stem from any of a wide spectrum of conditions spanning from bacterial infection of the gums to kidney failure, and is recognized by the Scientific Council of the American Dental Association as \\"a recognizable condition which deserves professional attention\\". Examples Australian journalist Ray Moynihan has argued that the pharmaceutical industry engages in disease mongering to enlarge its profits, and that it harms citizens. His use of osteoporosis as an example of a \\"made up\\" disease in this article prompted an angry retort from the president of the British National Osteoporosis Society, stating that the article was insulting to people with osteoporosis and vastly understated the risk of disabling fractures associated with the disorder. Moynihan published a satire of disease mongering in the 2006 April Fool's Day issue of BMJ titled \\"Scientists find new disease: motivational deficiency disorder\\". Other conditions which have been cited as examples of disease mongering include restless leg syndrome, testosterone deficiency, erectile dysfunction, hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Some of these conditions are recognized as medical disorders by professional medical societies and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. In 2014 an FDA advisory committee voted to limit the use of testosterone replacement therapy products due to potentially increased cardiovascular risk associated with their use. A 2006 Newcastle, New South Wales international conference, reported in PLoS Medicine, explored the phenomenon of disease mongering.

Anderson is a cargo ship of the laker type. She is famous for being the last ship to be in contact with before Edmund Fitzgerald sank on 10 November 1975. Arthur M. Anderson was also the first rescue ship on the scene in a vain search for Edmund Fitzgerald survivors. The vessel's namesake, Arthur Marvin Anderson, was director of U.S. Steel, a member of its finance committee and vice chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. at the time. The ship was launched in 1952 and is in active service.  History  Duluth ore dock. SS Arthur M. Anderson came out of the drydock of the American Ship Building Company of Lorain, Ohio in 1952.

Arthur M Andersons sea trials commenced on 7 August 1952, and she loaded her first cargo at the Two Harbors dock on 12 August 1952. She received several refits in her life including the addition of a new midsection in 1975 which added about 6,000 tons to her gross tonnage, bringing the total to about 26,000 tons. During the Lake Superior storm on November 10, 1975, she was operating in close company with the SS Edmund Fitzgerald and reported its loss to the USCG. In 1981 she received a self unloading boom which improved her cargo loading and unloading. She is unique among the three Great Lakes Fleet steamships in that she has a softer midsection that prohibits loading as much cargo as the others; roughly 1500 tons less.ABS trim and stability booklet In February 2015 Arthur M.

Free FM was given its name to highlight that its stations broadcast free-to-air, instead of requiring a subscription fee like satellite radio services. Launched on October 25, 2005, Free FM was phased out over the course of 2007, with the final station using it, KLSX, dropping the brand in November 2008. Free FM stations targeted a largely male demographic ranking from 18 to 49, attracting those who normally listen to FM rock and alternative stations, instead of existing AM talk radio listeners. Programs were more ribald than AM talk stations and include more discussion of dating, personal relationships, and pop culture, more comedy, and more discussion of celebrities and entertainment. Some Free FM stations also included music programs. Most Free FM programs were generally of the hot talk format. One Canadian radio station, CFRI-FM in Grande Prairie, Alberta, used to use the Free FM brand name before flipping to '2DayFM', although its ownership and format are unrelated to the American stations. History =Initial launch= On October 25, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting (now CBS Radio) officially announced that it would be replacing Howard Stern on many of its radio stations with David Lee Roth in New York City and several other eastern markets, Rover's Morning Glory with Shane \\"Rover\\" French in the midwest, and Adam Carolla in Los Angeles and several other western markets, along with already established DC-based morning show The Junkies on WJFK-FM in D.C. and WHFS-FM in Baltimore. On the same day, several of these Infinity/CBS radio stations became known as \\"Free FM\\"; some of the stations already had an all-talk format, while others switched from a music format, and WXRK New York announced that it would become \\"Free FM\\" starting January 3, 2006. In addition to the morning shows, Free FM also announced at this time the creation of Penn Radio, an hourlong radio show hosted from Las Vegas by illusionist Penn Jillette and co-hosted by Michael Goudeau, juggler at the Lance Burton Show. Other programming syndicated to a large number of Free FM stations included programming already in syndication at the time: The Don and Mike Show, The Tom Leykis Show, and Loveline. All three programs were being aired on Westwood One, at the time a corporate sister to CBS Radio. On March 2, 2007, Penn Radio, hosted by Penn Jillette, aired its last show. =Demise and replacement of Roth= In April 2006 rumors were reported that Roth's show would be dumped due to low ratings (The ratings for Roth's show in morning drive went down eighty percent compared to Howard Stern's ratings in the same slot a year prior) and would be replaced by XM's Opie and Anthony. The move marked Opie and Anthony's return to the New York terrestrial radio scene and to CBS Radio; their show was canceled by CBS/Infinity in 2002 when they were syndicated through sister station WNEW-FM due to a broadcast of the Sex For Sam III skit from St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York that generated much controversy. The move was confirmed by Opie and Anthony on their show and web site on Friday, April 21. As of that date, David Lee Roth's web site, david.freefm.com, had disappeared along with any mention of him on the Free FM local affiliates. On Monday, April 24, a Flash presentation presented on the Free FM local affiliates alluded to a debut time of 9 a.m. that day for the announcement of the return of the Opie and Anthony show. The show debuted on the former David Lee Roth affiliates on April 26. =Demise of Rover= In addition to the departure of Roth, Rover's Morning Glory was removed from the Free FM stations - including what was his newly assigned flagship WCKG/Chicago, and WKRK/Detroit; both instances due to very low ratings. Following the WCKG cancellation, Rover returned to Cleveland, Ohio on his previous flagship, WXRK - which became WKRK-FM - and a handful of remaining affiliates. Most of Rover's affiliates were on stations spun off by CBS Radio to different companies including WMFS/Memphis, WAQZ/Cincinnati and WZNE/Rochester, which went to Entercom; and WAZU/Columbus, which went to Wilks Broadcast Group. WAZU became country-formatted WNNK in January 2007, while WAQZ flipped to alternative rock as WSWD on a different frequency in November 2006; WMFS became an ESPN Radio affiliate in 2009. Rover's Morning Glory moved to rival station WMMS in 2008, thereby ending the CBS radio relationship altogether. WZNE, now owned by Stephens Media Group, continues to air the show. =Demise= With the lack of success that Free FM produced, CBS slowly phased out the homogenized Free FM brand. No new \\"Free FM\\" branded stations were launched since the network was created (although KCKC in Kansas City and KDJM (now KKSE-FM) in Denver were reportedly close to flipping to it before Free FM's demise), and new hot talk stations were branded in other ways: for instance, WTZN (now KDKA-FM) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was launched as a hot talk station in April 2007 as \\"The Zone\\" instead of Free FM, and even that station has since changed formats twice, first to Top 40/CHR and then to sports radio. In addition, all of the original Free FM stations eventually removed their \\"Free FM\\" branding, and have since changed formats altogether. *WHFS in Baltimore -- became Baltimore's FM Talk: A Free FM Station, later dropping A Free FM Station, and later flipped to sports radio 105.7 The Fan on November 3, 2008. *KRLD-FM in Dallas (formerly KLLI) -- reverted to Live 105.3, then also flipped to sports radio as 105.3 The Fan on December 8, 2008. *WCKG in Chicago -- became Chicago's FM Talk Station, followed shortly by The PaCKaGe. Changed to adult contemporary Fresh 105.9 on November 5, 2007, and given the new call letters WCFS-FM. Afternoon host Steve Dahl moved to sister station WJMK as morning host. In 2011, the station switched to a FM simulcast of all-news radio station WBBM (AM). *WJFK in Washington -- went from the standard 106.7 Free FM to Free FM 106.7 WJFK to Washington's Talk Superstation, 106.7 WJFK. On July 20, 2009, the station changed to sports radio 106.7 The Fan. *WYSP in Philadelphia -- dropped \\"Free FM\\" to become 94-1 WYSP, later reverting fully to their pre-Free moniker 94 WYSP as 94 WYSP Talks. Changed back to a Rock format on September 13, 2007 at 5:00 pm. *WTZN in Pittsburgh -- flipped back to a previous top 40 format known as B94, WBZW. Hosts Scott Paulsen, John Steigerwald and Dennis Miller moved to KDKA. Became SportsRadio 93.7 The Fan, KDKA-FM, on February 15, 2010. *KIFR in San Francisco -- was the first to drop Free FM, going to a classic hits format as KFRC (Adam Carolla, Opie and Anthony, and Tom Leykis moved to KYCY). In late October 2008, became an FM simulcast of news radio station KCBS (740) while retaining the KFRC call letters. *WFNY in New York City -- dropped Free FM altogether, and reverted to its previous modern rock format as WXRK \\"K-Rock\\". The station later operated with Top 40 formats under the 92.3 Now and 92.3 Amp Radio brands, before switching to alternative Alt 92.3 in November 2017. The dropping of Free FM on WFNY was generally recognized as the moment marking the death of the network. *KSCF in San Diego -- dropped Free FM altogether, changed to modern AC Sophie @ 103.7 on June 22, 2007, top 40 Energy in 2012, and country as 103.7 KSON in 2017. *KZON in Phoenix -- dropped Free FM altogether, changed to rhythmic contemporary \\"101.5 Jamz\\" on June 22, 2007 *WKRK-FM in Detroit -- dropped Free FM altogether, took over sister station WXYT's sports radio format, changing to WXYT-FM \\"Detroit's Sports Powerhouse\\"; currently \\"97.1 The Ticket\\" *KLSX in Los Angeles -- reverted to \\"97.1: The FM Talk Station\\" in 2008, then changed format altogether to contemporary hit \\"AMP Radio\\" on February 20, 2009. As of June 2007, CBS Radio has all but completely dropped the title of \\"Free FM\\" as a format and has instead replaced it with the more generic \\"FM Talk.\\" New domain names without the \\"Free FM\\" are now in use for several of the \\"Free FM\\" stations.CBS Radio station listing by format By October 1, 2007, only one Free FM station remained: KLSX. In 2008, KLSX dropped the \\"Free FM\\" moniker and was simply referred to as \\"The FM Talk Station\\". When KLSX switched format completely away from talk in February 2009, nearly all currently running shows were canceled, including The Adam Carolla Show which was the last program specifically created for Free FM to be discontinued, due to KLSX being its flagship station. The cancellation was a result of KLSX's shift to contemporary hit radio \\"AMP Radio\\" at that time. Two weeks later, Opie and Anthony were axed from terrestrial radio after WXRK changed formats, again to contemporary hit radio. The last hot-talk station in CBS's portfolio, WJFK-FM, abandoned the format for sports radio in July 2009, resulting in the cancellation of the Mike O'Meara Show, which was syndicated to many hot talk and Free FM stations. CBS Radio's corporate successor Entercom introduced a hot talk-oriented format on KEGY San Diego (which, upon the completion of the merger in November 2017, had moved its long-time country format as KSON to the former KSCF in exchange for then-current Energy format), branded as The Machine, in March 2018. The station featured hot talk programming during its weekday lineup, but broadcast classic rock interspersed with comedy bits at all other times, along with San Diego Padres baseball. The format, however, was short-lived; a promotional campaign for KEGY's Kevin Klein morning show (which invited listeners to \\"Jump ... to a new morning show\\") attracted criticism for glorifying suicide by bridge jumping, while Padres executive Ron Fowler expressed concerns over being associated with the station's content. KEGY transitioned to a conventional sports talk format as The Fan on April 12, 2018. =Former Free FM stations= right * New York -- WFNY, now WNYL 92.3 * San Francisco -- KIFR 106.9 * Philadelphia -- WYSP 94.1, now WIP-FM * San Diego -- KSCF 103.7, now KSON 103.7 * Phoenix -- KZON 101.5 * Pittsburgh -- WTZN-FM 93.7 * Detroit -- WKRK, now WXYT-FM 97.1 * Chicago -- WCKG, now WCFS-FM 105.9 * Baltimore -- WHFS, now WJZ-FM 105.7 * Los Angeles -- KLSX, now KAMP-FM 97.1 * Dallas, Texas -- KLLI, now KRLD-FM 105.3 References * Opie and Anthony announce return to CBS Radio Category:CBS Radio networks Category:Defunct radio networks in the United States Category:Franchised radio formats Category:Radio stations established in 2007 ","title":"Free FM"},{"id":"2998491","text":"Ernest Michael McSorley (September 29, 1912 - November 10, 1975) was the last captain of the ill-fated Laker-type freighter SS Edmund Fitzgerald. McSorley died along with the other 28 members of his crew when the Fitzgerald sank in Lake Superior on A Canadian by birth, McSorley wanted to captain a boat. At age eleven in 1924, he moved to the United States with his father and stepmother and spent his teenage years in the St. Lawrence River town of Ogdensburg, New York. A veteran mariner, McSorley had over 40 years experience on both the Great Lakes and oceans. He assumed command of the Fitzgerald at the start of the 1972 shipping season and had commanded nine ships before joining the crew of the Fitzgerald. A quiet man, McSorley was well respected by his contemporaries as a skillful master and by his men, whom he treated as professionals. McSorley had turned 63 a month and a half before the Fitzgerald incident and intended to retire at the end of the shipping season. Captain McSorley's last known words were, \\"We are holding our own.\\" Despite his death in a storm, McSorley was respected throughout his career as a superb heavy weather captain. McSorley resided in the Toledo suburb of Ottawa Hills, Ohio, and was married to the former Nellie Pollock, an Illinois native.

The highway was an at-grade expressway with a length of and located within the former Town of Emerson. It served as a connecting route between PTH 75 and Interstate 29 (I-29) at the Pembina- Emerson Border Crossing on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. History PTH 29 became a spur route of PTH 75 when the PTH 75/29 junction at Emerson was reconstructed in 1985 to direct through traffic to PTH 29/I-29 instead of to PTH 75's south to the nearby Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East Border Crossing and U.S. Route 75. Prior to this, through traffic was directed towards Noyes and U.S. 75; those wishing to travel I-29 were required to turn onto the connecting road north of the border. The Manitoba government officially rerouted PTH 75 to connect directly to the Pembina-Emerson border crossing in 2012, after the Noyes and Emerson East border stations were permanently closed, and discontinued the PTH 29 designation. While the route itself was not signed, PTH 29 was shown on Manitoba's official road map, though many other cartographers omitted it. The only sign identifying the highway could be seen traveling westbound on the former PTH 75 (now Provincial Road 200) toward the old PTH 75/29 intersection north of the border station.

Like other British troop carrying gliders in the Second World War, it was named after military figures whose name began with H, in this case the Jute invader Hengist. Design and development The use of assault gliders by the British was prompted by the use by Germany of the DFS 230 transport glider, which was first used in May 1940 to land assault troops on the Eben Emael fort in Belgium.Simons 1996, p. 99. Their advantage compared to parachute assault was that the troops landed in one place, rather than being dispersed. The Slingsby T.18 Hengist was designed by John \\"Jack\\" Frost. It was a 15-seat glider designed to meet Specification X.25/40 (in accordance to O.R.98), issued in February 1941. The specification was issued in case sufficiently powerful tugs were not available for the larger Airspeed Horsa.Ellison 1971, p. 188. Four prototypes were ordered in late 1940, the first prototype DG570 flying in January 1942, towed by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley.Swanborough 1997, p. 89. A total of 14 production Hengist Mk I were delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF) between February 1943 and March 1944. One of Frost's unique design touches was to fit the Hengist with a rubber bag as a landing device. A strengthened undercarriage was used on the production aircraft and was called the Mk III, but this name was not carried over to the RAF. The Hengist had a distinctive appearance with curved upper and lower surfaces and a flat sided fuselage. Operational history Two Hengist Mk Is were delivered to the Glider Pilots' Exercise Unit while others were issued to experimental units or remained in storage. Production was halted when Waco Hadrian gliders became available under lease-lend. As a back-up type, it saw no operational service and was phased out of service in 1946.

In the course of his studies he discovered what he thought important variance between the teaching of the Church of England and that of the Bible, and he did not conceal his convictions. In reading the service he altered or omitted phrases which seemed to him untrue, and in reading the Scriptures pointed out errors in the translation. A crisis was brought on by his sermon on the resurrection, preached at Easter 1773; and in November 1773 a prosecution was instituted against him in the consistory court of Gloucester. He was charged with depraving the public worship of God contained in the liturgy of the Church of England, asserting the same to be superstitious and unchristian, preaching, writing and conversing against the creeds and the divinity of our Saviour, and assuming to himself the power of making arbitrary alterations in his performance of the public worship. A protest was at once signed and published by a large number of his parishioners against, the prosecution. The case was dismissed on technical grounds, but appeals were made to the court of arches and the court of delegates. Meanwhile, Evanson had made his views generally known by several publications. In his later years he ministered to a Unitarian congregation at Lympston, Devonshire. In 1802 he published Reflections upon the State of Religion in Christendom, in which he attempted to explain and illustrate the mysterious foreshadowing of the Apocalypse. This he considered the most important of his writings. Shortly before his death at Colford, near Crediton, Devon, he completed his Second Thoughts on the Trinity, in reply to a work of the bishop of Gloucester. Works In 1772 he anonymously published his Doctrines of a Trinity and in the Incarnation of God, discussed Principles of Reason and Common Sense. This was followed in 1777 by a work addressed to Richard Hurd, A Letter to Dr. Hurd, Bishop of Worcester, wherein the Importance of the Prophecies of the old Testament and the Nature of the Grand Apostasy predicted in them are discussed. He also wrote some papers on the Sabbath, which brought him into controversy with Joseph Priestley, who published the whole discussion (1792). In the same year appeared Evanson's work entitled The Dissonance of the four generally received Evangelists, to which replies were published by Priestley and David Simpson (1793). Evanson rejected most of the books of the New Testament as forgeries, and of the four gospels he accepted only the Gospel of Luke. His sermons (prefaced by a Life by G. Rogers) were published in two volumes in 1807, and were the occasion of Thomas Falconer's Bampton Lectures in 1810. A narrative of the circumstances which led to the prosecution of Evanson was published by N. Havard, the town- clerk of Tewkesbury, in 1778.

In the thick of the forest is a childlike depiction of a dove. Both the forest and dove themes have appeared several times in Ernst's works. According to an analysis by the Tate Gallery in London the forest image represents the forest near Ernst's childhood home which inspired a sense of ‚Äòenchantment and terror‚Äô in the artist. The same analysis also states that the dove represents Ernst himself. The painting has a heavily textured and three-dimensional appearance. This is owed to a technique called grattage. Grattage was invented by Ernst and the Spanish surrealist Joan Mir√≥. This technique involves scraping the paint across the canvas so that the paint takes on the imprints of objects placed beneath the canvas.

Both school types prepare students to go to university. It was established in 1917. The Amsterdams Lyceum has around 1100 students, most of whom are from Amsterdam, but small numbers from outer municipalities such as Amstelveen and Badhoevedorp also find their way to this school.  History  The Amsterdams Lyceum is the oldest lyceum of the Netherlands. It was founded in 1917 by Dr. C. P. Gunning (1886-1960) who remained rector until 1952. The building has been in operation since 1920, it was designed by the Dutch Architect H.A.J. Baanders and built in the architectural style of the Amsterdamse school. The windows were painted by artist R.N. Roland Holst and the building is an official historic site and city monument. Dr. Gunning believed that school was more than just a place to obtain a diploma, many extra-curricular activities were initiated and in 1931 the school bought a private recreational retreat in the southeast Netherlands; Wolkenland. Every class would spend one week a year there working on alternative projects and assignments. During the World War II the Nazis appropriated the building, using the classrooms as barracks and the Rector's house as an officers' mess. On top of this, Dr. Gunning was an outspoken objector to the deportation of students. His protest meant that he was fired, arrested and imprisoned in Amersfoort concentration camp in January 1942. The school lost 95 (former) students during this period, every April a ceremony takes place to commemorate this loss.  Intensified language courses  At the Amsterdam Lyceum students can work their way through various optional intensified language courses. Trayecto Espanol, Corso Italiano and Fast Lane English. The latter course leads up to the Certificate in Advanced Englishhttp://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/general-english/cae.html in year 5 and the Certificate of Proficiency in Englishhttp://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/general-english/cpe.html in year 6.  Foreign exchanges  The Amsterdam Lyceum is famous for its foreign trips and exchanges. Besides Wolkenland the students go to other countries in their last three years of school. With Trayecto Espanol, Corso Italiano and Fast Lane English you are expected to visit the country corresponding to the language you study. This takes place in the fourth year of high school. Fast Lane students travel to Cambridge, Corso Italiano to Florence and Trayecto Espanol to Granada. In the fifth year the whole class goes to Rome. This is a 20-year-old tradition. In Amsterdam gymnasium schools visit Rome with the entire fifth year but the Amsterdam Lyceum goes with 120 students, also the Athenaeum students, who do not follow the gymnasium course. In the last year of high school there are eight international exchanges with schools in other countries. Those schools first visit the Amsterdam Lyceum before the students of the Dutch school visit them. The time span of those exchanges is usually eight or ten days. The options are Venice, South Africa, Israel, St. Petersburg, Sevilla, New York, Prague and Iceland.  Neighbourhood  The Amsterdam lyceum is located in a neighbourhood of Amsterdam called Oud-Zuid. Many families with little children live there and famous Dutch actors and writers. This area of Amsterdam is located south of the city center. It is among the wealthiest neighborhoods of Amsterdam. The school is in the museum area of Amsterdam with the Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum and the Concertgebouw. The Vondelpark is adjacent to the museum district. Students of the Amsterdams Lyceum go there often to relax, eat and play football.  Clubs  The Amsterdam Lyceum has a lot of clubs organized by the school. Every student no matter what age is allowed to participate in those activities. Auditions are only required at the dance and theater club. After three years at the drama club a certificate is handed out to you, and with that certificate the chance of being accepted to a professional theatre school is considerable. Every year there is a theatre week of dancing, singing and acting where teachers and the other students of The Amsterdam Lyceum view the performances. The Amsterdam Lyceum also has a rowing club, \\"De Drietand\\", a video, photo and etching club. They also have a great school newspaper, called the HALO. It's made by the students and has won several awards.  Alumni association  The Oud- Leerlingen Organisatie (Former Students Organization) abbreviated OLO is the alumni association of the school. Every former student is automatically considered a \\"member\\". The OLO is formally a foundation and is funded via donations of the alumni.

It has a surface of 13.5 km¬≤ and an average depth of one metre. Its elevation is 37 metres. D√ºmmer is a popular resort for water sports, but also an important biotope for water birds and located in a zone especially frequented by migratory birds. A large section of its shore is protected by nature reserve areas.  Location  View of the D√ºmmer from Mordkuhlenberg eastwards over the Dammer Berge The D√ºmmer is located in the D√ºmmer depression. One and a half miles to the west, the Damme Hills begin to rise, eventually reaching a height of 145 m. Around the lake are fens (Niedermoore) and raised bogs (Hochmoore). The lake lies in the D√ºmmer Nature Park, which is just under 500 km¬≤ in area, and in which the Damme Hills and Stemweder Berg form the central elements of the landscape. The open water of the lake belongs entirely to the district of Diepholz, but on its western shore the district of Vechta extends up to the dyke foreland. Near D√ºmmerlohausen the district boundary comes within a few metres of the shoreline. To the southwest by the mouth of the River Hunte a tip of the territory of the district of Osnabr√ºck advances to within half a kilometre of the lake. Whilst Diepholz district belonged to the Electorate of Hanover from 1585 (County of Diepholz) and 1582 (County of Hoya), the territory of the district of Vechta belonged for centuries to the Diocese of M√ºnster and only became part of Oldenburg in 1803 after the German Mediatisation. Hence it counts as part of Oldenburg M√ºnsterland.  Character  D√ºmmer Lake Sideview D√ºmmer Lake The D√ºmmer is, after the Steinhuder Meer, the second largest lake in Lower Saxony. With its water surface of 13.5 km ¬≤ - the area within the ring dyke including siltation zones is 16 km ¬≤ - and maximum water depth of just 1.50 m, it is good for swimming and water sports. The shallow lake with its flat beaches on the western and eastern shore is up to 5 km long from north to south and up to 3.4 km wide from west to east. The lake is crossed by the River Hunte, which leaves the lake via several branches, the largest of which is not called the \\"Hunte\\" but the Lohne. Other branches are the Grawiede and the artificial W√§tering, the Dorflohne, Schoddenlohne and Ompteda Canal. Only 13 km north of the lake and 3 km north of Diepholz all the branches of the Hunte are reunited. The fish-filled lake, which is also a breeding and resting place for birds, has a variety of flora and fauna, which is why the western and the southern shore of the lake are largely protected.Nieders√§chsischer Landesbetrieb f√ºr Wasserwirtschaft, K√ºsten- und Naturschutz (NLWKN): Naturschutzgebiet \\"D√ºmmer\\" Although the lake is only about a metre deep on average, very rich water sources and the Hunte itself ensure that its water level is relatively constant. Previously these headstreams combined with regular heavy rainfall to cause flooding, so that in the 1940s work began to build dykes around the lake. In the period 1941-1945 foreign forced labour was used for this on a large scale. The reclamation and subsequent lack of annual flooding resulted in algae growing in large quantities in the lake and hence depriving most other organisms of oxygen. The low water level was caused by heavy silting, also a result of dyking the lake. With the help of several locks it was possible to control the high water levels artificially without greatly interfering with nature. Nevertheless, the D√ºmmer suffers from heavy nutrient pollution caused by intensive agriculture. The remains of New Stone Age settlements have been found on the shores of the D√ºmmer.

It resulted in a Japanese victory. Background During the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 8 July 1937, the Japanese China Garrison Army attacked the walled city of Wanping (ÂÆõÂπ≥ÈéÆ) after an ultimatum to allow its forces to search for an allegedly missing soldier had elapsed. Wanping, in the neighborhood of Lugou Bridge, was on the main railway line west of Beiping and was of considerable strategic importance. Prior to July 1937, Japanese forces had repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese forces stationed at this place. Chinese General Song Zheyuan ordered his forces to hold their positions and attempted to avert war through diplomacy. On 9 July, the Japanese offered a ceasefire and truce, one of the conditions of which was that the Chinese 37th Division, which had proven \\"hostile\\" to Japan, be replaced with another division from the Chinese 29th Route Army. This condition was agreed to by the Chinese the same day. However, from midnight of 9 July, Japanese violations of the ceasefire began to increase and Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive. Lieutenant General Kanichiro Tashiro, commander of the Japanese China Garrison Army, fell ill and died on 12 July and was replaced by Lieutenant General Kiyoshi Katsuki. Muslim General Ma Bufang of the Ma clique notified the Chinese government that he was prepared to lead his army into battle against the Japanese when they started the attack on Beiping. Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under the Muslim General Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese. Ethnic Turkic Salar Muslims made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang.ËøòÂéüÁúüÂÆûÁöÑË•øÂåóÁæ§È©¨‰πãÈ©¨Ê≠•Ëä≥È™ëÂÖ´Â∏à‰∏≠ÂéüÊäóÊó• Order of battle Diplomatic maneuverings Meanwhile, the Japanese civilian government of Prime Minister Konoe in Tokyo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting on 8 July, and resolved to attempt to defuse hostilities and settle the issue diplomatically. However, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff authorized the deployment of an infantry division from the Chosen Army, two independent combined brigades from the Kwantung Army and an air regiment as reinforcements. This deployment was rescinded on 11 July on news that negotiations were being held by the commander of the Japanese Northern China Area Army and the Chinese 29th Route Army on location, and with Japanese diplomats at the Chinese capital of Nanjing. However, even after General Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army and head of the Hebei- Chahar Political Council, was reported to have come to terms on 18 July, the Japanese Army pushed forward the deployment of reinforcements citing lack of sincerity on part of the Chinese central government. This mobilization was strongly opposed by General Kanji Ishihara on the grounds that an unnecessary escalation in the conflict with China was endangering Japan's position in Manchukuo vis-√†-vis the Soviet Union. At Ishihara's urging, the deployment was delayed while Konoe used his personal contacts with Japanese acquaintances of Sun Yat-sen in an effort to establish a direct diplomatic settlement with the Kuomintang central government in Nanjing. This secret diplomacy failed when elements within the Japanese military detained Konoe's emissary on 23 July, and the mobilization of reinforcements was restarted on 29 July. One week later, the Commander of the Japanese Northern China Area Army reported that, having exhausted every means of peaceful settlement, he had decided to use force to \\"chastise\\" the Chinese 29th Route Army and requested approval from Tokyo. In the meantime, mobilization orders were issued for four more infantry divisions. Langfang Incident Despite the nominal truce, numerous violations of the ceasefire continued, including another shelling of Wanping by Japanese artillery on 14 July. By 25 July, Japanese reinforcements in the form of the IJA 20th Division arrived and fighting reerupted first at Langfang, a city on the railroad between Beiping and Tianjin, between companies of Japanese and Chinese troops. A second clash occurred on 26 July, when a Japanese brigade attempted to force its way through Guanghuamen Gate in Beiping to \\"protect Japanese nationals\\". The same day Japanese planes bombed Langfang. The Japanese then issued an ultimatum to General Song demanding the withdrawal of all Chinese forces from the outskirts of Beiping to the west of the Yongding River within 24 hours. Song refused, ordered his units to prepare for action, and requested large reinforcements from the central government, which were not provided. On 27 July, as the Japanese laid siege to Chinese forces in Tongzhou, one Chinese battalion broke out and fell back to . Japanese planes also bombed Chinese forces outside Beiping and reconnoitered Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and Luoyang. On 28 July, the IJA 20th Division and three independent combined brigades launched an offensive against Beiping, backed by close air support. The main attack was against Nanyuan and a secondary attack against Beiyuan. Bitter fighting ensued with both General Tong Linge Deputy Commander of Chinese 29th Route Army and General Zhao Dengyu commanding Chinese 132nd Division being killed, and their units suffering heavy casualties. However, a brigade of Chinese 38th Division under General Liu Chen-san pushed back the Japanese in the Langfang area while a brigade of the Chinese 53rd Corps and a portion of the Chinese 37th Division recovered the railway station at Fengtai. However, this was only a temporary respite, and by nightfall General Song admitted that further combat was futile and withdrew the main force of Chinese 29th Route Army south of the Yungging River. Tianjin Major General Zhang Zizhong was left in Beiping to take charge of political affairs in Hebei and Chahar provinces with virtually no troops. General Liu Ruzhen's New Separate 29th Brigade was left in Beiping to maintain public order. Tungchow Incident On 29 July, the Japanese collaborationist East Hopei Army troops mutinied against the Japanese in Tungchow (Tongzhou), killing most of their Japanese advisors and other civilians, including women and children.‰∏≠ÊùëÁ≤≤ „ÄéÂ§ßÊù±‰∫úÊà¶‰∫â„Å∏„ÅÆÈÅì„ÄèÂ±ï„ÄÖÁ§æ,1990Âπ¥ Fall of Tianjin Meanwhile, on the coast at dawn of 29 July, the IJA 5th Division and Japanese naval forces separately attacked Tianjin and the port at Tanggu, which were defended by units of Chinese 38th Division and volunteers under acting commander Liu Wen- tien. General Huang Wei-kang's brigade defended the Taku Forts gallantly and also attacked a nearby Japanese airfield, destroying many aircraft. However, with increasing Japanese reinforcements his position was untenable, and that night (30 July) General Zhang Zizhong was ordered to withdraw toward Machang and Yangliuching south of Tianjin, abandoning the city and Taku Forts to the Japanese. Fall of Beiping On 28 July, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Song Zheyuan to retreat to Paoting in southern Hebei province. Over the next two days, intense fighting took place in Tianjin, where the Chinese forces put up a stiff resistance, but subsequently the Chinese retreated south along the lines of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway and the Peiping-Hankow Railway. On 4 August, General Liu Ruzhen's remaining forces withdrew into Chahar. Isolated, Beiping was captured by the Japanese without further resistance on 8 August 1937. General Masakazu Kawabe entered the city on 18 August in a military parade, and posted proclamations at important points announcing that he was the new military governor of the city. Zhang was allowed to retain his position as mayor, but left the city secretly a week later. Aftermath With the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, the North China Plain was helpless against the Japanese divisions which occupied it by the end of the year. The Chinese National Revolutionary Army was in constant retreat until the hard fought Battle of Taierzhuang. Zhang was vilified relentlessly by the Chinese press, and reviled as a traitor. Upon arrival at Nanjing he apologized publicly. Since he later died fighting against the Japanese, the Kuomintang posthumously pardoned Zhang for the events in Beiping.

Background When the Tokugawa seclusion (the sakoku policy) was forcibly breached in 1853‚Äì54 by Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the United States Navy, Japan found that geography no longer ensured security‚Äîthe country was defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. After the Black Ships, Perry's naval squadron, had compelled Japan to enter into relations with the Western world, the first foreign policy debate was over whether Japan should embark on an extensive modernization to cope with the threat of the \\"eastward advance of Western power,\\" which had already violated the independence of China, or expel the \\"barbarians\\" under the parole sonn≈ç j≈çi and return to seclusion. Opening the country caused an upheaval that in the end caused the demise of the Tokugawa bakufu, but the sh≈çguns of the period were too weak to pose a serious opposition. The opening of Japan accelerated a revolution that was just waiting to happen. During the Meiji Restoration, Japan was already in a place slowly increasing its westernization practices brought on by the west. As Commodore Perry, and his team, sailed into the ports of Japan, they brought with them an unusual style of etiquette, such as dictation, books and standard of western technology. Prior to foreigners intruding Japan, the people had never seen steam ships, nevertheless guns with power, such as the ones Perry brought. During the pre-industrial Japan era, the country heavily relied on swords, and other weapons to defend itself. Japan was not used to seeing modern, and industrialized weaponry. Since the first visit by Commodore Perry, \\"he brought fear into the lives of Japanese natives\\", as well as the government, run by the Emperor Mutsuhito. Having little-to-no means of fighting off such a strong, industrialized group, Japans military officials ultimately gave in to Perry‚Äôs demand to allow them to freely port, and trade, into Japan‚Äôs domain. Not only did the feudal lords fail to preserve what they had for so long, but they were also pressured into signing multiple treaties with the Americans known as, ‚ÄúThe Unequal Treaties‚Äù. Japan used Perry's visit to their advantage, learning from their weaponry, style of public speaking, and with time, was ultimately able to become an industrialized state. Beginning with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which established a new, centralized regime, Japan set out to \\"gather wisdom from all over the world\\" and embarked on an ambitious program of military, social, political, and economic reforms that transformed it within a generation into a modern nation-state and major world power. ‚ÄúPropelled by both fear and discontent with the old regime, they generated an ambitious agenda, through a process of trial and error, aiming to build a new sort of national power‚Äù. Multiple new policies were brought forth, One of the things that was brought forth was the Charter Oath, ‚ÄúThe oath called for an assembly of daimyo in which decisions would be made after open discussion ; ‚Äúthe high and the low‚Äù ( samurai and commoners) to administer together financial affairs; both military and ‚Äúcommon people‚Äù to be allowed to fulfill their goals without strife; past evil practices to be abandoned and accepted world precepts followed; and, finally, knowledge to be sought worldwide to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule\\" (Hopper Pg.57). The Meiji oligarchy was aware of Western progress, and \\"learning missions\\" were sent abroad to absorb as much of it as possible. The Iwakura Mission, the most important one, was led by Iwakura Tomomi, Kido Takayoshi and ≈åkubo Toshimichi, contained forty-eight members in total and spent two years (1871‚Äì73) touring the United States and Europe, studying every aspect of modern nations, such as government institutions, courts, prison systems, schools, the import-export business, factories, shipyards, glass plants, mines, and other enterprises. Upon returning, mission members called for domestic reforms that would help Japan catch up with the West. The revision of unequal treaties, forced on Japan in the 1850s and 60s, became a top priority. The Meiji leaders also sketched a new vision for a modernized Japan's leadership role in Asia, but they realized that this role required that Japan develop its national strength, cultivate nationalism among the population, and carefully craft policies toward potential enemies. No longer could Westerners be seen as \\"barbarians,\\" for example. In 1890 the emperor and his aids had created a new document concerning how education was to be handled. This was called the, ‚ÄúRescript on Education‚Äù. It had all of the things that were to be adhered to concerning education within it, and this rescript lasted all the way until WW2 was ending. It was composed as follows, ‚ÄúThe rescript, which contained the fundamental principles for all elementary education, was based on Confucian morality redefined by late nineteenth- century official doctrine, which embraced the sacredness of the emperor.‚Äù In time, Japan formed a corps of professional diplomats through education. Military buildup Modern Japan's foreign policy was shaped at the outset by its need to reconcile its Asian identity with its desire for status and security in an international order dominated by the West. The principal foreign policy goals of the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) were to protect the integrity and independence of the nation against Western domination and to win equality of status with the leading nations of the West by reversing the unequal treaties. Because fear of Western military power was the chief concern of the Meiji leaders, their highest priority was building up the basic requirements for national defense, under the slogan \\"wealth and arms\\" ('). They saw that a modern military establishment required national conscription drawing manpower from an adequately educated population, a trained officer corps, a sophisticated chain of command, and strategy and tactics adapted to contemporary conditions. Finally, it required modern arms together with the factories to make them, sufficient wealth to purchase them, and a transportation system to deliver them. An important objective of the military buildup was to gain the respect of the Western powers and achieve equal status for Japan in the international community. Inequality of status was symbolized by the treaties imposed on Japan when the country was first opened to foreign intercourse. The treaties were objectionable to the Japanese not only because they imposed low fixed tariffs on foreign imports and thus handicapped domestic industries, but also because their provisions gave a virtual monopoly of external trade to foreigners and granted extraterritorial status to foreign nationals in Japan, exempting them from Japanese jurisdiction and placing Japan in the inferior category of uncivilized nations. Many of the social and institutional reforms of the Meiji period were designed to remove the stigma of backwardness and inferiority represented by the \\"unequal treaties\\", and a major task of Meiji diplomacy was to press for early treaty revision. Overseas expansion Once created, the Meiji military machine was used to extend Japanese power overseas, for many leaders believed that national security depended on expansion and not merely a strong defense. Room was also needed for population expansion. Within thirty years, the country's military forces had fought and defeated imperial China in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95), winning possession of Taiwan and China's recognition of Korea's independence. Ten years later, in the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì5), Japan defeated tsarist Russia and won possession of southern Sakhalin as well as a position of paramount influence in Korea and southern Manchuria. By this time, Japan had been able to negotiate revisions of the unequal treaties with the Western powers and had in 1902 formed an alliance with the world's leading power, Britain. =Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands= In 1879, Japan formally annexed the Ryukyuan kingdom, which had been under the control of the Shimazu clan of Satsuma since 1609. Taiwan The island of Formosa (Taiwan) had an indigenous population when Dutch traders in need of an Asian base to trade with Japan and China arrived in 1623. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) soon began to rule the natives. China took control in the 1660s, and sent in settlers. In 1873 and 1874, friction came about between China and Japan over Taiwan, particularly when the Japanese launched a punitive expedition into Taiwan in the wake of the killing of several Okinawans by Taiwanese aborigines. By the 1890s there were about 2.3 million Han Chinese and 200,000 members of indigenous tribes living on Taiwan. After its victory in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894‚Äì95, the peace treaty ceded the island to Japan.Jonathan Manthorpe, Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan (2008) ch 11-12 Japan expected far more benefits from the occupation of Taiwan than they actually received. Japan realized that its home islands could only support a limited resource base, and it hoped that Taiwan, with its fertile farmlands, would make up the shortage. By 1905, Taiwan was producing rice and sugar and paying for itself with a small surplus. Perhaps more important, Japan gained enormous prestige by being the first nonwhite country to operate a modern colony. It learned how to adjust its German-based bureaucratic standards to actual conditions, and how to deal with frequent insurrections. The ultimate goal was to promote Japanese language and culture, but the administrators realize they first had to adjust to the Chinese culture of the people. Japan had a civilizing mission, and it opened schools so that the peasants could become productive and patriotic manual workers. Medical facilities were modernized, and the death rate plunged. To maintain order, Japan installed a police state that closely monitored everyone. In 1945, Japan was stripped of its overseas empire and Taiwan was returned to China.Manthorpe, Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan (2008) ch 13 =Korea= The Korean Peninsula, a strategically located feature critical to the defense of the Japanese archipelago, greatly occupied Japan's attention in the nineteenth century. Earlier tension over Korea had been settled temporarily through the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876, which opened Korean ports to Japan, and through the Tianjin Convention in 1885, which provided for the removal from Korea of both Chinese and Japanese troops sent to support contending factions in the Korean court. In effect, the convention had made Korea a co-protectorate of Beijing and Tokyo at a time when Russian, British, and American interests in the peninsula also were on the increase. In 1894, China and Japan went to war over Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War, and the subsequent Treaty of Shimonoseki of April 1895 forced defeated China to recognize Korean independence, and later that year, Japanese agents would assassinate Korea's anti-Japanese Queen Min. Ironically, a decade after the Treaty of Shimonoseki had forced China to recognize Korean independence, Japan, in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War, effectively forced Korea to sign the Eulsa Protective Treaty, which made Korea a protectorate of Japan. In 1910, Korea was formally annexed to the Japanese empire, beginning a period of Japanese colonial rule of Korea that would not end until 1945. =China= In 1871, despite Chinese consternation over Japan asserting its control over the Ryukyu Islands the previous year, China and Japan signed the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty. Two years later, in 1873, the Japanese foreign minister Soejima Taneomi who had won the gratitude of the Chinese government for his handling of the Mar√≠a Luz incident in 1872, was dispatched to Beijing as an ambassador. His trip had three purposes: one was to convey the congratulations of the Emperor Meiji to the sixteen-year-old Tongzhi Emperor for his assumption of personal rule, the second was to exchange documents relating to the Trade and Friendship Treaty and the third was to discuss with the Chinese the punishment of some Taiwanese natives who had killed several shipwrecked Okinawans.Keene, Donald Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912 (Columbia University Press) pg. 223 Yet, despite the gratitude that the Chinese had expressed towards him for how he handled the Maria Luz case, Soejima found the officials arrogant and difficult to negotiate with.Keene, pg. 225 He nevertheless managed to obtain an audience with the emperor of China,Keene, pg. 227 and helped negotiate protocol for the audience that the Chinese emperor was to grant to the European and American envoys to China, earning him the gratitude of both the western envoys, and yet again, the Qing imperial court.Keene, pg. 229 In 1874, Chinese and Japanese relations were put under strain when the Japanese took military action against Taiwan in order to pacify natives. Conflict between China and Japan would be averted in Korea in 1885 thanks to the negotiations between Li Hongzhang and It≈ç Hirobumi which led to the Tianjin Convention, which established a joint protectorate over Korea. This would postpone a war over Korea by a decade. A crisis was precipitated in 1894 when a leading pro-Japanese Korean political figure was assassinated in Shanghai with Chinese complicity. Prowar elements in Japan called for a punitive expedition, which the cabinet resisted. With assistance from several Japanese nationalistic societies, the illegal Tonghak (Eastern Learning) nationalistic religious movement in Korea staged a peasant rebellion that was crushed by Chinese troops. Japan responded with force and quickly defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95). After nine months of fighting, a cease-fire was called and peace talks were held. The victor's demands were such that a Japanese protectorate over China seemed in the offing, but an assassination attempt on Li Hongzhang, China's envoy to the peace talks, embarrassed Japan, which then quickly agreed to an armistice. The Treaty of Shimonoseki accomplished several things: recognition of Korean independence; cessation of Korean tribute to China; a 200 million tael (Chinese ounces of silver, the equivalent in 1895 of US$150 million) indemnity to Korea from China; cession of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan; and opening of Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) ports to Japanese trade. It also assured Japanese rights to engage in industrial enterprises in China. Having their own imperialist designs on China and fearing China's impending disintegration, Russia, Germany, and France jointly objected to Japanese control of Liaodong. Threatened with a tripartite naval maneuver in Korean waters, Japan decided to give back Liaodong in return for a larger indemnity from China. Russia moved to fill the void by securing from China a twenty- five-year lease of Dalian (Dairen in Japanese, also known as Port Arthur) and rights to the South Manchurian Railway Company, a semioffical Japanese company, to construct a railroad. Russia also wanted to lease more Manchurian territory, and, although Japan was loath to confront Russia over this issue, it did move to use Korea as a bargaining point: Japan would recognize Russian leaseholds in southern Manchuria if Russia would leave Korean affairs to Japan. The Russians only agreed not to impede the work of Japanese advisers in Korea, but Japan was able to use diplomatic initiatives to keep Russia from leasing Korean territory in 1899. At the same time, Japan was able to wrest a concession from China that the coastal areas of Fujian Province, across the strait from Taiwan, were within Japan's sphere of influence and could not be leased to other powers. In 1900, Japanese forces participated in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion, exacting still more indemnity from China. =British alliance= Japan then succeeded in attracting a Western ally to its cause. Japan and Britain, both of whom wanted to keep Russia out of Manchuria, signed the Treaty of Alliance in 1902, which was in effect until in 1921 when the two signed the Four Power Treaty on Insular Possessions, which took effect in 1923. The British recognized Japanese interests in Korea and assured Japan they would remain neutral in case of a Russo-Japanese war but would become more actively involved if another power (probably an allusion to France) entered the war as a Russian ally. In the face of this joint threat, Russia became more conciliatory toward Japan and agreed to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in 1903. The new balance of power in Korea favored Japan and allowed Britain to concentrate its interests elsewhere in Asia. Hence, Tokyo moved to gain influence over Korean banks, opened its own financial institutions in Korea, and began constructing railroads and obstructing Russian and French undertakings on the peninsula. =War with Russia= When Russia failed to withdraw its troops from Manchuria by an appointed date, Japan issued a protest. Russia replied that it would agree to a partition of Korea at the thirty-ninth parallel, with a Japanese sphere to the south and a neutral zone to the north. But Manchuria was to be outside Japan's sphere, and Russia would not guarantee the evacuation of its troops. Despite the urging of caution by most genro, Japan's hardliners issued an ultimatum to Russia, which showed no signs of further compromise. The Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904 with Japanese surprise attacks on Russian warships at Dalian and Chemulpo (in Korea, now called Incheon). Despite tremendous loss of life on both sides, the Japanese won a series of land battles and then decisively defeated Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet (renamed the Second Pacific Squadron) at the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. At an American-mediated peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In the Treaty of Portsmouth Russia acknowledged Japan's paramount interests in Korea and agreed to avoid \\"military measures\\" in Manchuria and Korea. Both sides agreed to evacuate Manchuria, except for the Guandong Territory (a leasehold on the Liaodong Peninsula) and restore the occupied areas to China. Russia transferred its lease on Dalian and adjacent territories and railroads to Japan, ceded the southern half of Sakhalin to Japan, and granted Japan fishing rights in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. Japanese nationalism intensified after the Russo-Japanese War, and a new phase of continental expansion began after 1905. Politically and economically, Korea became a protectorate of Japan and in 1910 was formally annexed as a part of the empire (cf. Korea under Japanese rule). By means of the South Manchurian Railway, Japanese entrepreneurs vigorously exploited Manchuria. By 1907 Russia had entered into a treaty arrangement with Japan whereby both sides recognized the other's sphere of influence in Manchuria.

Islambouli stated that his primary motivation for the assassination was Sadat's signing of the Camp David Accords with the State of Israel and Sadat's plan for a more progressive Egypt. Islambouli was tried before an Egyptian court-martial, found guilty, and sentenced to death by firing squad. Following his execution, he was declared a martyr by many radicals in the Islamic world, and became an inspirational symbol for radical Islamic movements as one of the first 'modern martyrs' for Islam.The Islambouli Enigma , The Jamestown Foundation Early years and career Islambouli was born in Minya Governorate. His father was an Egyptian legal advisor and his mother was of Turkish descent. After graduating from the Egyptian Military Academy, he was commissioned as an officer in the Artillery Forces of the Egyptian Army with the rank of second lieutenant. Sometime after this appointment, Islambouli joined the proscribed Egyptian Islamic Jihad movement. Between 1976 and 1980, he served mostly as a staff officer or as fire direction officer for various artillery batteries, battalions and regiments. In March 1980, he got his first field command, an artillery platoon gun line in the 116th Field Artillery Brigade based in Cairo. His command included three 'active' field howitzers, a reserve field gun, five to six transport trucks, seven jeeps, signaling equipment, light infantry weapons such as assault rifles, medium machine guns, anti-tank rockets, light mortars, and sniper rifles for organic defence, and around 45 soldiers/conscripts, with a second lieutenant and a sergeant acting as second-in-command and third-in- command respectively. His role was to take firing missions and orders from the Battery HQ. Apparently, he was scheduled and approved for promotion to captain by December 1981 and for posting as Staff Officer-III in a Brigade HQ. Assassination of Sadat Islambouli and his platoon originally were not supposed to participate in the October parade, but they were chosen by the Military Intelligence, which was infiltrated by Islamist sympathizers under Colonel Abbud al-Zumar, to replace a platoon from the 133rd Artillery Battalion which was excused from participation for apparently failing some routine tests and checks.Riedel, Bruce. \\"The Search for al-Qaeda\\", 2008 Once his platoon containing three heavy trucks towing M-46 field artillery guns began to approach the President's platform, Islambouli, along with Junior Sergeant Abdelhameed Abdul Salaam, 31, Corporal Ata Tayel Hameeda Raheel, 21, and Corporal Hussein Abbas, 21,al-Zayat, Montasser, \\"The Road to al-Qaeda\\", 2002 leapt from their truck and ran towards the stand while lobbing grenades toward where the President was standing with other Egyptian and foreign dignitaries. Execution Islambouli was captured immediately after the assassination. He and twenty-three conspirators, including eight military personnel, were tried before an Egyptian court-martial. Found guilty, 27-year- old Islambouli and three other conspirators were executed by firing squad on 15 April 1982. Following Islambouli's execution, Iranian Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini declared him a martyr. Relatives Islambouli's younger brother Mohammed Showqi Al-Islambouli came close to assassinating the Egyptian President and Sadat's successor Hosni Mubarak on 22 June 1995 on the way from Addis Ababa International Airport to an African summit in the city. Showqi and his associates opened fire on the armour-plated limousine destroying most of the escort vehicles. However, Mubarak was saved by the skills of his chauffeur, who U-turned the damaged limousine and raced back to the airport where the presidential plane was waiting with running engines.Mubarak 1995 assassination attempt Debka Legacy Islambouli continues to serve as an inspirational symbol for Islamist movements throughout the world, including terrorist groups.

It was released on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009. Brisingr focuses on the story of Eragon and his dragon Saphira as they continue their quest to overthrow the corrupt ruler of the Empire, Galbatorix. Eragon is one of the last remaining Dragon Riders, a group that governed the fictional nation of Alaga√´sia, where the series takes place. Brisingr begins almost immediately after the preceding novel Eldest concludes. Published by Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books, the book sold 550,000 copies on its first day of sale, a record for a Random House children's book. The novel debuted at number one on USA Today's top 150 bestsellers list. Reviewers criticized the book for its length, while commenting on Paolini's growing maturity in his treatment of characters. Plot =Setting and characters= Brisingr begins about three days after the events in Eldest conclude. It continues the story of the Inheritance Cycle and takes place on the fictional continent of Alaga√´sia during a struggle for power as the small country Surda and a rebel group called the Varden attempts to overthrow the larger Empire. They are supported mainly by elves, dwarves, and Urgals, but the Empire is populated with large numbers of humans, who far outnumber Surda and its allies. The Inheritance Cycle focuses on the story of a teenage boy named Eragon and his dragon Saphira. Eragon is one of the few remaining Dragon Riders, a group that governed Alaga√´sia in past times but were almost destroyed by a Rider named Galbatorix, who took control of the land. Galbatorix's greatest fear is that a new Rider will rise up and usurp his position as king of the Empire, Galbatorix's shade, Durza, knows a dragon egg went to the spine, so he sends the Ra-Zac to investigate, causing Eragon to lose his home, and have to flee with a storyteller named Brom. Brisingr is told in third-person from the perspectives of multiple primary protagonists. These characters include the humans Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada, and the dragons Saphira and Glaedr. The humans Galbatorix and Murtagh return as antagonists, along with Murtagh's dragon, Thorn. The Ra'zac return for a minor antagonist role, and Varaug, a Shade, also appears for a main antagonist role. Many minor characters reprise their roles in Brisingr from previous installments of the Inheritance Cycle, including the elves Arya, Islanzad√≠, and Oromis; the dwarf Orik; the humans Angela, Katrina and Elva; and the dragon Glaedr. =Plot summary= Eragon, Saphira, and Roran travel to Helgrind, the home of the Ra'zac. There, they rescue Roran's betrothed, Katrina, held prisoner there, and kill one of the Ra'zac. Saphira, Roran, and Katrina return to the Varden, while Eragon stays behind. Eragon slays the remaining Ra'zac, who warns him that Galbatorix has discovered \\"the name\\". Eragon also finds and condemns Sloan, Katrina's treacherous father, to never meet his daughter again, and arranges for him to travel to Ellesmera, the elven homeland. Eragon then travels back to the Varden, after reuniting with Arya, who had come in search of him. Once they return to the Varden, Eragon discovers that Katrina is pregnant with Roran's child and a wedding is arranged, which Eragon is to conduct. Just before it begins, a small force of troops attack alongside Murtagh and his dragon, Thorn. The soldiers had spells cast on them that removed their ability to feel pain, making them better fighters. Elven spell-casters aid Eragon and Saphira and cause Murtagh and Thorn to flee, winning the battle. After the fight, Roran marries Katrina. The leader of the Varden, Nasuada, orders Eragon to attend the election of the new dwarf king in the Beor Mountains, while Saphira stays behind to protect the Varden. Eragon is to support the bid of Orik, the former king's adoptive son, who favors the Varden. Eragon heads to Farthen Dur, where the election takes place. Once there, Eragon is the target of an assassination attempt, perpetrated by a Rider-hating dwarf clan, whom Orik forces into exile. Having earned the sympathies of the dwarves, Orik is elected the new king. Saphira journeys to Farthen Dur for Orik's coronation and repairs Isidar Mithrim, the previously destroyed star rose. After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira journey to Ellesm√©ra to learn the secret of Galbatorix's power. There, they learn that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, was Eragon's father. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, a dragon organ, which allows its holder to communicate with and draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, drawing his power from the dragons he slew. After some training, Eragon visits Rhun√∂n, the elven blacksmith who forged swords for Riders. Rhun√∂n refuses to forge Eragon a new sword, having sworn to never create a weapon again, and having depleted her stocks of the required metal. By deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions, Eragon acquires the metal from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. Rhun√∂n forges him a sword by controlling Eragon's body, and he names it \\"Brisingr\\", which causes it to burst into flames whenever its name is said aloud. Oromis and Glaedr decide to join the battle against the Empire alongside Islanzad√≠. To prevent Galbatorix from claiming his Eldunari should he fall in combat, and to continue guiging Eragon, Glaedr gives his Eldunari to Eragon. Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, a city sieged by the Varden. Meanwhile, Roran is sent on various missions as a soldier of the Varden. One mission against soldiers that can't feel pain results in many casualties, and in Roran being assigned to an incompetent commander. During another mission, this commander almost causes the entire force to be decimated. Roran takes charge of a small group of soldiers loyal to him, and leads them to victory against overwhelming odds. Despite this, Roran is charged with insubordination and is flogged as a punishment. Afterwards, Nasuada promotes Roran to commander and sends his unit on a mission with both men and Urgals, to enforce the idea of men and Urgals working together. When an Urgal, Yarbog, challenges Roran for leadership of the unit, he wrestles him into submission. After returning to the Varden, his squad joins the siege of Feinster. As the siege begins, Eragon rescues Arya and departs to find the leader of the city, but discovers three magicians attempting to create a Shade. While attempting to kill the magicians, Eragon has a vision through Glaedr's Eldunar√≠ showing him and Oromis fighting Murtagh and Thorn in the sky. During the fight, Galbatorix takes control of Murtagh, and tries to lure Oromis to his side. Failing to do so, he slays Oromis as he suffers a seizure. Glaedr, in grief, is also killed. After the vision, the magicians succeed in creating the Shade Varaug. Eragon and Arya fight and slay Varaug, with Arya dealing the fatal blow. After the successful siege, Eragon resolves to continue the fight against the Empire, to avenge Oromis and Glaedr. Background =Writing= The first two books in the Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15 million copies worldwide together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and the publisher of the books, prepared Brisingr's release by printing 2.5 million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that \\"As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word.\\" He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother. Unlike Eragon, Brisingr features multiple points of view. Parts of the book are written in Saphira's perspective for the first time in the series. Paolini based the dragon's behavior and attitude on the pets and animals he grew up around, particularly his pet cats: \\"I thought a dragon would be like a cat in some ways, that same sort of self-satisfied attitude.\\" He added that it was challenging to depict scenes from the standpoint of a dragon, but he enjoyed doing it because Saphira \\"has so many interesting thoughts and opinions.\\" The Ancient Language used by the elves in the Inheritance Cycle is partly based on Old Norse. The word brisingr is an ancient Old Norse word meaning \\"fire\\", which Paolini found while reading through a dictionary of word origins. Paolini said he \\"loved it so much, he decided to base the rest of [the Ancient Language] on Old Norse. To find more words, I went online and dug up dictionaries and guides to the language. I invented more words based on what I learned and then formed a system of grammar and a pronunciation guide to fit my world. Developing this has probably been the most difficult part of writing the books.\\" The languages used by the dwarves and Urgals in the book were created from scratch by Paolini. When asked by Sci Fi Wire what kind of challenges he faced while writing the book, Paolini said it was trying to avoid any references to modern items or actions. Brisingr takes place long before the industrial revolution, which Paolini said \\"limits not only the things my characters use and do, but it also informs their worldview. This constraint extends to more recent words and phrases as well. For example, in Brisingr, I was going to use the description short-order. When I researched its origins, however, I discovered that it was coined to describe modern cooking: a short-order cook.\\" Alt URL =Split and editing= According to its author, Brisingr features a complex story with \\"weighty moral dilemmas\\" and \\"a sheer number of events that gives it a rich narrative.\\" Halfway through the writing of the book, Paolini realized the story was so complex that it was going to end up being 2,000 pages. He decided to split it into two books, and thus the Inheritance Trilogy became the Inheritance Cycle. Paolini revealed this decision in an October 2007 press release, and stated that his development as a writer since Eragon is what caused the book to become so complex. The decision to bring in and then kill a Shade at the end of the book was made when Paolini realized he needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong enough to keep the reader interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with the Shade battle to further keep the reader interested. The first draft of the book was finished in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy \\"chewing [his] way through the editing, which has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around.\\" The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. \\"However, as most any writer will tell you, just because you spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript. The only question that matters is whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole,\\" he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf who worked with Paolini on Eragon and Eldest, assisted Paolini as the editor of Brisingr. =Title, cover, and audio book= John Jude Palencar illustrated the cover of Brisingr. Paolini said \\"Brisingr\\" was one of the first words he thought of for the book's title, as it was the first Ancient Language word that Eragon learned in the series, and it holds a particular significance for him. Unlike the first two books in the series, Brisingr has a subtitle: The Seven Promises of Eragon Shadeslayer and Saphira Bjartskular. Paolini revealed it in a newsletter at his official website, in which he said that it was added \\"because I felt it suited the story, and also because, in a way, I still view Brisingr and Book Four as two halves of the same volume; the subtitle is merely the name of the first of these two sections.\\" John Jude Palencar illustrated the English cover featuring the golden dragon Glaedr. The content of the cover was one of the few things initially confirmed by Paolini before he wrote the book. He had originally planned for it to feature a green dragon, but later indicated that this was affected by the expansion of the series to a four-book cycle. Paolini liked the cover because it reflects that Brisingr is the longest and \\"most intense entry in the series so far.\\" The Japanese translation of Brisingr was so large that the publisher split it into two volumes. Since the Japanese did not want the same cover on two volumes, they commissioned Palencar to paint one of the Lethrblaka for the second volume. The Lethrblaka are the Ra'zac's steeds and parents. Paolini made drawings based on the book for the deluxe edition of Brisingr, including one with Eragon's arm and hand holding the sword he receives in the book. The sword, named Brisingr, has flames around its blade. Gerard Doyle provided the voice for the English audio book of Brisingr. In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini to do this because he cannot \\"roll [his] r's\\" properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going \\"largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I latch onto those as best I can. But if a creature‚Äôs anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal.\\" Promotion and release Paolini visited the Beckman auditorium at Caltech during his book tour to promote Brisingr. In March 2008, a spoiler about the book was released on the Inheritance Cycle's official website, stating that \\"In Brisingr, Eragon will meet a god.\\" In May 2008, Paolini posted a video message on his website stating that in the book, Eragon will meet \\"a new, rather terrifying enemy\\" that \\"likes to laugh, but not in a good way.\\" A third and final spoiler was released by Paolini in July 2008, stating that one of the characters will become pregnant in the book. Excerpts from Brisingr were released both on the official Inheritance Cycle website and on MSNBC, which held an interview with Paolini the day before the release of the book. Paolini toured across ten cities in the North America to promote the book; his first visit was to New York City on September 19, 2008, and his last was to Bozeman on November 22, 2008. Brisingr was released in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom on September 20, 2008, though it was originally supposed to be released on September 23, 2008. Nancy Hinkel, publishing director of Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, said the company received \\"an outpouring of requests from booksellers hoping to host midnight launch parties. We have responded to their enthusiasm by advancing the date, and we know fans will welcome the opportunity to celebrate the publication together.\\" More than 2,500 midnight party events were held in the United States for the September 20 release. A deluxe edition of Brisingr was released on October 13, 2009, including deleted scenes, foldout posters, never-before-seen art by the author, and a guide to dwarf runes. Brisingr sold 550,000 copies in North America on its first day of an initial print run of 2.5 million copies. Both the initial print run and first-day sales were the largest ever for the Random House Children's Book division. Brisingr sold 45,000 copies on its first day in the United Kingdom and was the fastest- selling children's book in the country in 2008. In Australia, the book sold 141,000 copies in 2008, making it one of the country's top ten best-selling books of the year. Brisingr debuted at number one on USA Today's top 150 bestsellers list. It stayed on the list for 25 consecutive weeks until March 3, 2009. Critical reception Brisingr received mixed to positive reviews, with critical reviewers commenting on the book's length and Paolini's growing maturity in his treatment of characters. David Durham of The Washington Post gave the novel a moderately negative review, praising Paolini for his streamlined prose, but saying the novel loses focus in the middle. He added, though, that Brisingr \\"reconnects with the core elements that animate Eragon's tale\\" toward the end of the book, and Paolini shows growing maturity during some \\"quiet\\" moments in Brisingr, although Durham noted these parts could bore younger readers. Durham also found that Paolini's new characters are original, and that Paolini added depth to some characters from the previous novels in the Inheritance Cycle. In contrast, Sheena McFarland of The Salt Lake Tribune said that Paolini \\"hasn't learned how to create characters that readers can relate to,\\" although she praised him for strong female characters in Brisingr such as Arya and Nasuada. McFarland calls the last fifty pages \\"riveting\\", but says they are a \\"paltry reward for trudging through the 700 preceding pages.\\" Publishers Weekly gave Brisingr a negative review, criticizing the novel for relying on \\"classic fantasy tropes\\", and noting that Brisingr might appeal to younger readers, but older readers might be unimpressed. Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA) reviewer Kathleen Beck criticized the length of the book, accusing Paolini of \\"plainly [enjoying] wandering around in his fantasy world\\" and urging him to provide a cleaner finish to the series. She further criticized the content of the book, asserting that \\"there is a lot of action in [Brisingr] but paradoxically not much forward motion.\\" Haley Keeley of The Buffalo News, however, commented that with alternating points of views every few chapters, Paolini \\"manages to convey the complexity of the situation while offering refreshing new perspectives.\\" Children's Literature writer Jamie Hain gave the book a positive review, praising the action scenes, as well as the appeal to both male and female readers. She asserts that it is a \\"long read\\", but it is \\"worth it for those who reach the end.\\" On Goodreads, Brisingr has a score of 4.04 out of 5.

Geneva School of Linguistics The most prominent figure of the Geneva School of Linguistics school was Ferdinand de Saussure. Other important colleagues and students of Saussure who comprise this school include Albert Sechehaye, Albert Riedlinger, Serge Karcevski and Charles Bally. The most significant linguistic book connected with this school is Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale, the main work of de Saussure, which was published by his students Charles Bally and Albert Sehechaye. The book was based on lectures with this title that de Saussure gave three times in Geneva from 1906 to 1912. Sehechaye and Bally did not themselves take part in these lecture classes, but they used notes from other students. The most important of these students was Albert Riedlinger, who provided them with the most material. Furthermore, Bally and Sehechaye continued to develop de Saussure's theories, mainly focusing on the linguistic research of speech. Sehechaye also concentrated on syntactic problems. =Charles Bally= In addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics. He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like de Saussure, from Switzerland. His parent were Jean Gabriel, a teacher and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. Bally was married three times: first with Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a mental institution in 1915 and Alice Bellicot. From 1883 to 1885 he studied classic language and literature in Geneva. He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a PhD. After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. At the same time, he worked as PD at the university from 1893 to 1913. Finally from 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative Indo-German studies which he took over from Ferdinand de Saussure. Besides his works about subjectivity in the French Language he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes. Today Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic theories of style and much honored for his theories of phraseology.

Durrer, Introduction √† la linguistique de Charles Bally, 1998 Geneva School of Literary Criticism The expression \\"Geneva School\\" () is also applied to a group of literary critics in the 1950s and 1960s, of which the most important were the Belgian critic Georges Poulet, the French critic Jean-Pierre Richard, and the Swiss critics Marcel Raymond, Albert B√©guin, Jean Rousset and Jean Starobinski. The critics Emil Staiger, Gaston Bachelard, and J. Hillis Miller are also sometimes associated with this group. Growing out of Russian Formalism and Phenomenology (such as in the work of Edmund Husserl), the \\"Geneva School\\" used the phenomenological method to attempt to analyse works of literature as representations of deep structures of an author's consciousness and his or her relationship to the real world. Biographical criticism was however avoided, as these critics focused primarily on the work of art itself - treated as an organic whole and considered a subjective interpretation of reality (the German concept of Lebenswelt) - and sought out the recurrent themes and images, especially those concerning time and space and the interactions between the self and others.For this section, see Eagleton 1983, pp. 58‚Äì60.

The Meiji oligarchy was the new ruling class of Meiji period Japan. In Japanese, the Meiji oligarchy is called the . The members of this class were adherents of kokugaku and believed they were the creators of a new order as grand as that established by Japan's original founders. Two of the major figures of this group were ≈åkubo Toshimichi (1832‚Äì78), son of a Satsuma retainer, and Satsuma samurai Saig≈ç Takamori (1827‚Äì77), who had joined forces with Ch≈çsh≈´, Tosa, and Hizen to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. Okubo became minister of finance and Saig≈ç a field marshal; both were imperial councillors. Kido Koin (1833‚Äì77), a native of Ch≈çsh≈´, student of Yoshida Sh≈çin, and conspirator with ≈åkubo and Saig≈ç, became minister of education and chairman of the Governors' Conference and pushed for constitutional government. Also prominent were Iwakura Tomomi (1825‚Äì83), a Kyoto native who had opposed the Tokugawa and was to become the first ambassador to the United States, and ≈åkuma Shigenobu (1838‚Äì1922), of Hizen, a student of Rangaku, Chinese, and English, who held various ministerial portfolios, eventually becoming prime minister in 1898. To accomplish the new order's goals, the Meiji oligarchy set out to abolish the four divisions of society through a series of economic and social reforms. Tokugawa shogunate revenues had depended on taxes on Tokugawa and other daimyo lands, loans from wealthy peasants and urban merchants, limited customs fees, and reluctantly accepted foreign loans. To provide revenue and develop a sound infrastructure, the new government financed harbor improvements, lighthouses, machinery imports, schools, overseas study for students, salaries for foreign teachers and advisers, modernization of the army and navy, railroads and telegraph networks, and foreign diplomatic missions, such as the Iwakura mission. Difficult economic times, manifested by increasing incidents of agrarian rioting, led to calls for social reforms. In addition to the old high rents, taxes, and interest rates, the average citizen was faced with cash payments for new taxes, military conscription, and tuition charges for the newly introduced compulsory education. The people needed more time for productive pursuits while correcting social abuses of the past. To achieve these reforms, the old Tokugawa class system of samurai, farmer, artisan, and merchant was abolished by 1871, and, even though old prejudices and status consciousness continued, all were theoretically equal before the law. Actually helping to perpetuate social distinctions, the government named new social divisions: the former daimy≈ç became peerage nobility, the samurai became gentry, and all others became commoners. Daimy≈ç and samurai pensions were paid off in lump sums, and the samurai later lost their exclusive claim to military positions. Former samurai found new pursuits as bureaucrats, teachers, army officers, police officials, journalists, scholars, colonists in the northern parts of Japan, bankers, and businessmen. These occupations helped stem some of the discontent this large group felt; some profited immensely, but many were not successful and provided significant opposition in the ensuing years. The 1873 Korean crisis resulted in the resignation of military expedition proponents Saig≈ç and Councillor of State Et≈ç Shimpei (1834‚Äì74). Et≈ç, the founder of various patriotic organizations, conspired with other discontented elements to start an armed insurrection against government troops in Saga, the capital of his native prefecture in Ky≈´sh≈´ in 1874. Charged with suppressing the revolt, ≈åkubo swiftly crushed Et≈ç, who had appealed unsuccessfully to Saig≈ç for help. Three years later, the last major armed uprising‚Äîbut the most serious challenge to the Meiji government‚Äîtook shape in the Satsuma Rebellion, this time with Saig≈ç playing an active role. The Saga Rebellion and other agrarian and samurai uprisings mounted in protest to the Meiji reforms had been easily put down by the army. Satsuma's former samurai were numerous, however, and they had a long tradition of opposition to central authority. Saig≈ç, with some reluctance and only after more widespread dissatisfaction with the Meiji reforms, raised a rebellion in 1877. Both sides fought well, but the modern weaponry and better financing of the government forces ended the Satsuma Rebellion. Although he was defeated and committed suicide, Saig≈ç was not branded a traitor and became a heroic figure in Japanese history. The suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion marked the end of serious threats to the Meiji regime but was sobering to the oligarchy. The fight drained the national treasury, led to serious inflation, and forced land values‚Äîand badly needed taxes‚Äîdown. Most important, calls for reform were renewed.

Heliconius melpomene The theory of facilitated variation demonstrates how seemingly complex biological systems can arise through a limited number of regulatory genetic changes, through the differential re-use of pre-existing developmental components. The theory was presented in 2005 by Marc W. Kirschner (a professor and chair at the Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School) and John C. Gerhart (a professor at the Graduate School, University of California, Berkeley). The theory of facilitated variation addresses the nature and function of phenotypic variation in evolution. Recent advances in cellular and evolutionary developmental biology shed light on a number of mechanisms for generating novelty. Most anatomical and physiological traits that have evolved since the Cambrian are, according to Kirschner and Gerhart, the result of regulatory changes in the usage of various conserved core components that function in development and physiology. Novel traits arise as novel packages of modular core components, which requires modest genetic change in regulatory elements. The modularity and adaptability of developmental systems reduces the number of regulatory changes needed to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, increases the probability that genetic mutation will be viable, and allows organisms to respond flexibly to novel environments. In this manner, the conserved core processes facilitate the generation of adaptive phenotypic variation, which natural selection subsequently propagates. Description of the theory The theory of facilitated variation consists of several elements. Organisms are built from a set of highly conserved modules called \\"core processes\\" that function in development and physiology, and have remained largely unchanged for millions (in some instances billions) of years. Genetic mutation leads to regulatory changes in the package of core components (i.e. new combinations, amounts, and functional states of those components) exhibited by an organism. Finally, the altered combinations, amounts, and states of the conserved components function to develop and operate a new trait on which natural selection acts. Because of their modular organization, adaptability (e.g. arising through exploratory processes) and compartmentation, developmental systems tend to produce facilitated (i.e. functional and adaptive) phenotypic variation when challenged by genetic mutation or novel environmental conditions. =Conserved core components= Animals are built from a tool kit of components (e.g. like lego bricks). Most of the core components are conserved across diverse phyla of the animal kingdom. Examples of core components are: * DNA replication, * DNA transcription to RNA, * translation of RNA to protein, * formation of microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletons, * cell‚Äìcell signaling pathways, * cell adhesion processes, * anteroposterior axis formation Additional core processes, such as appendage and limb formation in arthropods and tetrapods, respectively, are combinations of different conserved core processes linked in new regulatory configurations, and conserved in their entirety. =Weak regulatory linkage= Different core processes become linked, through differential regulation, in different combinations, and operate in different amounts, states, times, and places, to generate new anatomical and physiological traits. These regulatory linkages can be made and changed easily, a phenomenon that Kirschner and Gerhart call ‚Äúweak regulatory linkage‚Äù. Regulatory signals can switch on and off the core components to elicit complex responses. Although the signal seems to control the response, typically the responding core process can produce the output by itself but inhibits itself from doing so. All the signal does is interfere with this self-inhibition. Regulatory change is easily effected because conserved core processes have switch-like behavior and alternative outputs already built into them, which means that regulation does not need to coevolve with the functional output. =Exploratory processes= Some conserved core processes, called \\"exploratory processes\\", have the ability to generate many different phenotypical outcomes or states. Examples include: * the formation of microtubule structures, * the development of the nervous system (i.e. connecting of axons and target organs), * synapse elimination, * muscle patterning, * the production of blood vessels, * vertebrate immune system, * animal learning Exploratory processes first generate a very large amount of physiological variation, often at random, and then select or stabilize the most useful ones, with the rest disappearing or dying back. Hence, exploratory processes resemble a Darwinian process operating during development. For example, as the vascular system develops, blood vessels expand to regions with insufficient oxygen supply. There is no predetermined genetically specified map for the distribution of blood vessels in the body, but the vascular system responds to signals from hypoxic tissues, whilst unrequired vessels in well- oxygenated tissues die back. Exploratory processes are powerful because they provide organisms with a tremendous scope for adaptation. =Compartmentation= Ancient regulatory processes (evolved in pre-Cambrian animals) allow the re-use of core processes in different combinations, amounts, and states in some regions of the body, or certain times in development, while decreasing their chances of generating disruptive or maladaptive pleiotropic effects elsewhere in the organism. Spatial compartmentation of transcriptional regulation and cell‚Äìcell signaling are examples. The vertebrate embryo is organized spatially into perhaps 200 compartments, each uniquely defined by its expression of one or a few key genes encoding transcription factors or signaling molecules. An example of compartmentation is found in the developing spine: all vertebrae contain bone- forming cells, but those in the chest form ribs, whereas those in the neck do not, because they arose in different compartments (expressing different Hox genes). Other forms of regulatory compartmentation include different cell types, developmental stages, and sexes. Example: evolution of the wing Gerhart and Kirschner give the example of the evolution of a bird or bat wing from a tetrapod forelimb. They explain how, if bones undergo regulatory change in length and thickness as a result of genetic mutation, the muscles, nerves and vasculature will accommodate to those changes without themselves requiring independent regulatory change. Studies of limb development show that muscle, nerve, and vascular founder cells originate in the embryonic trunk and migrate into the developing limb bud, which initially contains only bone and dermis precursors. Muscle precursors are adaptable; they receive signals from developing dermis and bone and take positions relative to them, wherever they are. Then, as noted previously, axons in large numbers extend into the bud from the nerve cord; some fortuitously contact muscle targets and are stabilized, and the rest shrink back. Finally, vascular progenitors enter. Wherever limb cells are hypoxic, they secrete signals that trigger nearby blood vessels to grow into their vicinity. Because of the adaptability conferred by exploratory processes, the co-evolution of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels is not required. Selection does not have to coordinate multiple independently varying parts. This not only means that viable phenotypes can easily be generated with little genetic change, but also that genetic mutations are less likely to be lethal, that large phenotypic changes can be favored by selection, and that phenotypic variation is functional and adaptive (i.e. ‚Äòfacilitated‚Äô). Computational analyses The theory of facilitated variation is supported by computational analyses of the evolution of regulatory networks. These studies confirm that phenotypic variability can be directed towards phenotypes with high fitness even when mutations are randomly distributed, and even when challenged with novel environmental conditions. Parter et al. demonstrate how key elements of facilitated variation theory, such as weak regulatory linkage, modularity, and reduced pleiotropy of mutations, evolve spontaneously under realistic conditions. Facilitated variation and evolution In the classical Darwinian view, a large number of successive mutations, each selected for its usefulness to the survival of the organism, is required to produce novel structures such as wings, limbs, or the brain. Alternatively, facilitated variation asserts that the physiological adaptability of core processes and properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes enable proteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways that can lead to the creation of novelty with a limited number of genes, and a limited number of mutations. Therefore, the role of mutations is often to change how, where, and when the genes are expressed during the development of the embryo and adult. The burden of creativity in evolution does not rest on selection alone. Through its ancient repertoire of core processes, the current phenotype of the animal determines the kind, amount, and viability of phenotypic variation the animal can produce in response to regulatory change. In emphasizing the adaptability of organisms, and their ability to produce functional phenotypes even in the face of mutation or environmental change, Kirschner and Gerhart‚Äôs theory builds upon earlier ideas by James Baldwin (the Baldwin effect), Ivan Schmalhausen, Conrad Waddington (genetic assimilation and accommodation), and Mary Jane West-Eberhard (‚Äògenes are followers not leaders‚Äô). More recently, the theory of facilitated variation has been embraced by advocates of an extended evolutionary synthesis, and emphasized for its role in generating non-random phenotypic variation (‚Äòdevelopmental bias‚Äô). However, some evolutionary biologists remain skeptical as to whether facilitated variation adds a great deal to evolutionary theory. Refutation of Intelligent Design Creationists and advocates of Intelligent Design have argued that complex traits cannot evolve through successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems. The theory of facilitated variation challenges this idea of irreducible complexity by explaining how random mutation can cause substantial and adaptive changes within a species. It explains how the individual organism can change from a passive target of natural selection, to an active player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. Kirschner and Gerhart's theory thereby provides a scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion Intelligent Design.

An important advantage is the very deep color it produces even at low concentration, a disadvantage is that it fades fairly quickly when exposed to light. In medicine, Patent Blue V is used in lymphangiography and sentinel node biopsy as a dye to color lymph vessels.Erratum - 44 (4): 649 - The Journal of Nuclear Medicine It is also used in dental disclosing tablets as a stain to show dental plaque on teeth. The color of the dye is pH-dependent. In aqueous solution, its color will vary from a deep blue in alkaline or weakly acidic medium to a yellow‚Äìorange in stronger acidic conditions. It is useful as a pH indicator for the range 0.8‚Äì3.0. The structure is also redox- sensitive, changing from a reduced yellow form to an oxidized red form in solution. The reduction potential of around 0.77 volts is similar to that of other triphenylmethane dyes. It is usable as a reversible redox indicator in some analytical methods. Because of its pH-dependent color, Patent Blue V was included in chemistry sets from Salter Science in the 1970s and 80s under the name Sky Blue.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1903 to 1908, and in the House of Commons of Canada from 1908 to 1911. Campbell was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. Campbell was born at Fort Pelly, in what was then known as the Northwest Territories. His father, Robert Campbell, was a Scotsman who served as Chief Factor for the Hudson's Bay Company, the dominant power in the region. The younger Campbell was educated at Glasgow Academy and the Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, and worked as a farmer and rancher upon returning to Canada. He helped to establish the community of Gilbert Plains in 1884, after purchasing the first house constructed in the community from Gilbert Ross, for whom the community is named. Two years later, Campbell married Ross' first cousin, Harriet Burns, daughter of the Ojibwa Chief Keeseekoowenin, who had been baptized as \\"Moses Burns\\" by the Presbyterian missionary George Flett. who was Campbell's wife's second cousin. In 1885, Campbell was promoted in the field to rank of Captain in the Battle of Batoche as a member of Boulton's Scouts. Campbell was serving as a scout for Major Gen. Middleton. He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election as a support of the opposition Conservative Party, and lost to Theodore Arthur Burrows by nine votes in Dauphin. Burrows described himself as a \\"Liberal-Conservative\\", but endorsed the Liberal government of Thomas Greenway; he later joined the Liberal Party outright. Campbell lost to Burrows again in the 1896 election, by twelve votes. He was first elected to the legislature in the 1903 election, defeated a Liberal candidate by 202 votes in Gilbert Plains. He served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government, and was re-elected without opposition in the 1907 election. Campbell resigned from the provincial legislature in 1908 to campaign in the 1908 federal election. Contesting the riding of Dauphin, he defeated his old nemesis Theodore Arthur Burrows in 217 votes to win the seat. The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election under Wilfrid Laurier, and Campbell served as an opposition member for the next three years. He lost his seat to Liberal Robert Cruise by 748 votes in the 1911 election, even as the Conservative Party won a majority government under Robert Borden. When King George V declared war in 1914, Campbell formed Manitoba's 107th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force which served in France. He died of kidney failure on 20 October 1917 and is buried at Camiers, France.

The beach is long, sandy, gently sloping and faces the Atlantic Ocean near the western limit of the Bristol Channel. It is a popular destination for surfing and family holidays and is part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The beach has been managed by Parkin Estates Ltd for over half a century and has over the years continuously been recognised as one of the best beaches in Europe. It won the title of Britain's Best Beach in the \\"Coast Magazine Awards 2012\\" and was awarded the same prize of Britain's Best Beach in 2015 by TripAdvisor, also ranking in their polls as 4th in Europe and 13th best in the world. The beach water quality is monitored regularly by the environment agency and meets its highest standards. Tourism The winter population is very small (around 1,000), but during the summer large numbers of people come to the village for their holidays. Many are motivated to visit because of the excellent surfing conditions found locally. There are many hotels, holiday flats, holiday parks, campsites and bed and breakfast establishments, and most of the entertainment opportunities are aimed at tourists. The village is served by a local independent pharmacy which is open all year round and a satellite doctors surgery. A long-established attraction in the centre of the village was a crazy golf course which featured North Devon landmarks for the holes, the unique model buildings being constructed from the various types of stone found in the local area. This attraction was demolished and rebuilt as a pirate themed crazy golf course in 2010. =Awards= *Family Resort of the Year ‚Äì Gold Award (England for Excellence ‚Äì 1999): \\"A beach that is everyone's ideal - golden and sandy - perfect for a traditional bucket and spade holiday\\" *Best Beach (2nd place) (The Observer ‚Äì 2000) *ENCAMS Seaside Award (2003) *Tidy Britain Seaside Award (2005) *Blue Flag beach (2005, 2006, 2007 and others) *Coast Magazine Awards 2012 - Winner - Britain's Best Beach *TripAdvisor Best English beach 2013 *TripAdvisor 5th Best Beach in Europe 2013 *TripAdvisor Best English beach 2014 *TripAdvisor Best British beach 2015 *TripAdvisor 4th Best Beach in Europe 2015 Geology and wildlife Woolacombe Beach and the sea, as seen from the main car park Woolacombe Bay Hotel Woolacombe lies within the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which is renowned for its dramatic coastal cliffs and landscape. Due to Atlantic waves, the swell is at somewhat large and very clean making it a great benefit for surfing. The beach also is flanked by sloping sand dunes which are popular for climbing on, and can be observed undergoing biological succession - The dunes are becoming populated by marram grass and sea spurge at the top of the dunes. Right across from the beach, there are panoramic views of Lundy Island. Woolacombe has the benefit of low cliffs at either end of the beach which are home to the rare maritime heathland as well as sand dunes behind the beach. Much of the countryside close to the village is owned and cared for by the National Trust. The coast itself is part of the North Devon Voluntary Marine Conservation Area because of its diverse and rare species. History Like a number of British beaches, it is privately owned and until 1948 the beach and much of the surrounding land was owned by the Chichester family, who acquired it in 1133 during the reign of King Henry I. When Lady Rosalie Chichester, the last of the line, died in 1949 it had been in her family‚Äôs possession for over 800 years. On her death the Chichester's land in Woolacombe and Mortehoe and the family estate at Arlington near Barnstaple had been willed to the National Trust. However, the beach and some surrounding land had previously been purchased by Stanley Parkin, a family friend. Ray Parkin, the current chairman, has been closely involved with the development and management of the company since 1985 and took over as chairman on the death of his father in 1995. During the Second World War, the U.S. Army Assault Training Centre was based at Woolacombe, where thousands of small boat crews and infantry practised amphibious landing assaults on the beach in preparation for the Invasion of Normandy, part of Operation Overlord. The long flat shape of the beach and the conditions of the hinterland were considered to closely resemble the Omaha Beach landing area. There is a stone memorial to the soldiers, dedicated in 1992, sited on the grassy headland at the northern end of the beach. Transport The main way to get to Woolacombe is by road. During the summer the roads, which are largely very rural and quite narrow, can become very congested as people queue up to get into one of the two large car parks which are situated close to the beach. A bus service runs from the village to Barnstaple (303), Ilfracombe, Combe Martin and Mortehoe. The village had a joint railway station with Mortehoe on the Ilfracombe Branch Line which closed in 1970. There is also a locally operated bus by one of the holiday park companies which ferries holidaymakers from their four caravan and camping parks to the beach which helps ease congestion at peak times. The South West Coast Path runs through the village, and gives access to the spectacular North Devon coast, with the walk out to and around Morte Point being particularly popular. There are several establishments in the area that provide opportunities for pony trekking. Some offer experienced riders the chance to ride along Woolacombe Sands. Religion The Church of St Sabinus was designed by W. D. Car√∂e There are several places of worship in Woolacombe, all Christian. The most obvious of these is the Anglican Church of St Sabinus, consecrated in 1912, and which is sited on the main road into the village centre. The church was built to cater for the growing number of tourists visiting the village every year after the opening of the local railway station in 1874. The church is dedicated to St Sabinus, a canonised Italian bishop; local stories claim it was named after a missionary from Ireland who was ship-wrecked at Woolacombe but there is no evidence to support this. St. Sabinus church was designed by the architect W. D. Car√∂e and built in 1909-12. A branch of the California-based Calvary Chapel was established in 2000, meeting at the time in the village hall, now meets in the old Methodist Church, Beach Lane; and in 2002 the chapel organised the first Creation Fest, a free Christian music festival, held annually on the outskirts of the village until 2008, when the festival was relocated to Cornwall.

On some CNC machine controllers, the available memory is too small to contain the machining program (for example machining complex surfaces), so in this case the program is stored in a separate computer and sent directly to the machine, one block at a time. If the computer is connected to a number of machines it can distribute programs to different machines as required. Usually, the manufacturer of the control provides suitable DNC software. However, if this provision is not possible, some software companies provide DNC applications that fulfill the purpose. DNC networking or DNC communication is always required when CAM programs are to run on some CNC machine control. Wireless DNC is also used in place of hard-wired versions. Controls of this type are very widely used in industries with significant sheet metal fabrication, such as the automotive, appliance, and aerospace industries. History =1950s-1970s= Programs had to be walked to NC controls, generally on paper tape. NC controls had paper tape readers precisely for this purpose. Many companies were still punching programs on paper tape well into the 1980s, more than twenty-five years after its elimination in the computer industry. =1980s= The focus in the 1980s was mainly on reliably transferring NC programs between a host computer and the control. The Host computers would frequently be Sun Microsystems, HP, Prime, DEC or IBM type computers running a variety of CAD/CAM software. DNC companies offered machine tool links using rugged proprietary terminals and networks. For example, DLog offered an x86 based terminal, and NCPC had one based on the 6809. The host software would be responsible for tracking and authorising NC program modifications. Depending on program size, for the first time operators had the opportunity to modify programs at the DNC terminal. No time was lost due to broken tapes, and if the software was correctly used, an operator running incorrect or out of date programs became a thing of the past. Older controls frequently had no port capable of receiving programs such as an RS232 or RS422 connector. In these cases, a device known as a Behind The Reader or BTR card was used. The connection between the control's tape reader and the internal processor was interrupted by a microprocessor based device which emulated the paper tape reader's signals, but which had a serial port connected to the DNC system. As far as the control was concerned, it was receiving from the paper tape unit as it always had; in fact it was the BTR or Reader Emulation card which was transmitting. A switch was frequently added to permit the paper tape reader to be used as a backup. =1990s to present= The PC explosion in the late 1980s and early 1990s signalled the end of the road for proprietary DNC terminals. With some exceptions, CNC manufacturers began migrating to PC-based controls running DOS, Windows or OS/2 which could be linked in to existing networks using standard protocols. Customers began migrating away from expensive minicomputer and workstation based CAD/CAM toward more cost- effective PC-based solutions. Users began to demand more from their DNC systems than secure upload/download and editing. PC-based systems which could accomplish these tasks based on standard networks began to be available at minimal or no cost. In some cases, users no longer needed a DNC \\"expert\\" to implement shop floor networking, and could do it themselves. However, the task can still be a challenge based on the CNC Control wiring requirements, parameters and NC program format. To remain competitive, therefore, DNC companies moved their offerings upmarket into DNC Networking, Shop Floor Control or SFC, Manufacturing Execution Systems or MES. These terms encompass concepts such as real-time Machine Monitoring, Graphics, Tool Management, Traveler Management and Scheduling. Instead of merely acting as a repository for programs, DNC systems aim to give operators at the machine an integrated view of all the information (both textual and graphical) they require in order to carry out a manufacturing operation, and give management timely information as to the progress of each step. DNC systems are frequently directly integrated with corporate CAD/CAM, ERP and Computer-aided Process Planning CAPP systems. Special protocols A challenge when interfacing into machine tools is that in some cases special protocols are used. Two well-known examples are Mazak's Mazatrol and Heidenhain's LSV2 protocol. Many DNC systems offer support for these protocols. Another protocol is DNC2 which is found on Fanuc controls. DNC2 allows advanced interchange of data with the control, such as tooling offsets, tool life information and machine status as well as automated transfer without operator intervention. Machine monitoring One of the issues involved in machine monitoring is whether or not it can be accomplished automatically in a practical way. In the 1980s monitoring was typically done by having a menu on the DNC terminal where the operator had to manually indicate what was being done by selecting from a menu, which has obvious drawbacks. There have been advances in passive monitoring systems where the machine condition can be determined by hardware attached in such a way as not to interfere with machine operations (and potentially void warranties). Many modern controls allow external applications to query their status using a special protocol. MTConnect is one prominent attempt to augment the existing world of proprietary systems with some open-source, industry- standard protocols and XML schemas and an ecosystem of massively multiplayer app development and mashups (analogous to that with smartphones) so that these long-sought higher levels of manufacturing business intelligence and workflow automation can be realized. Alternatives Smaller facilities will typically use a portable PC or laptop to avoid the expense of a fully networked DNC system. In the past Facit Walk Disk and a similar device from Mazak were very popular.

Lancelotto Malocello () (Latin: Lanzarotus Marocelus; ; fl. 1312) was a Genoese navigator, who gave his name to the island of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands. Lancelotto is the Italian form of the proper name Lancelot. History Lancelotto Malocello was born in Varazze (Republic of Genoa), now Province of Savona, in 1270. The navigator is credited with the rediscovery of the Canary Islands in 1312; the island first appeared on a European map of Angelino Dulcert (the Dulcert Atlas) in 1339 under the name \\"√çnsula de Lan√ßarote Mallucellus\\" (island of Lancelotto Malocello), later shortened to \\"Lanzarote\\". The island's native name was Tyterogaka. Malocello may have voyaged in search of the brothers Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, who had sailed to the Canary Islands in 1291 on their way to India, and whose fate was unknown. Malocello arrived on the island in 1312, and remained there for almost two decades until he was expelled by a Guanche revolt. Information about this revolt is scanty, but his stay on the island is supported by various sources, including the chronicles of the Norman conquest of the island under Jean de Bethencourt almost a century later, which state that the fortress constructed by Malocello could still be found on the island. Malocello's fortress was situated above Teguise. At the time of Malocello's arrival, a king named Zonzamas ruled the island. Ico, his daughter, and Guanarame, her consort, succeeded Zonzamas. Their son Guadarfia was the ruler who would greet the expedition of Jean de Bethencourt in 1402. Legacy To celebrate the seventh centenary of the discovery of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands by the Italian navigator Lanzarotto Malocello, which took place in 1312, promoters formed two committees, one in Spain and one in Italy. The committees sponsored various events in Rome, Varazze, Brussels, Strasbourg, Madrid and Lanzarote, among other cities. In 2012 Lanzarote commemorated the 700 anniversary of Malocello's rediscovery of the Canary Islands with a number of conferences. One of the speakers was Alfonso Licata, who focused on the historical context of the voyage.\\"Lanzarote honors Lancelotto Malocello on the 700 anniversary of his arrival on the island\\", La Voz, April 27, 2012 A delegation of the mayor and 162 residents of Varazze (Malocello's hometown) visited Lanzarote. They arrived aboard the cruise ship Costa Deliziosa, which followed a route between Italy and Lanzarote emulating the path Malocello likely followed to the Canaries.Comitato Promotore per le celebrazioni VII¬∞ Centenario della Scopertadi Lanzarote e delle Isole Canarie da parte del navigatore italiano Lanzarotto Malocello (1312-2012) To commemorate the event has been coined a commemorative medal made official by the School of the Art Medal and Mint State and published a book by Alfonso Licata \\"Lanzarotto Malocello, from Italy to the Canary\\" by the CISM- Ministry of Defence. The Council of Roma Capitale, in 2012, at the request of the organizing committee, on the occasion of the seventh centenary, has dedicated a public green park furnished to the illustrious navigator in the Ostiense district. Similarly, the city of Savona, in turn, again at the request of the Organising Committee in 2013 dedicated to Malocello a green Area equipped with playground in the Port area.

Notable examples of firearms using this method are the MG 42 general-purpose machine gun, and the CZ 52 semi-automatic pistol. It was also applied in the experimental Ger√§t 03 semi-automatic rifle and Ger√§t 06 and EM-1 experimental assault rifles. The MG 42's lineage continued past World War II, forming the basis for the nearly identical MG1 (MG 42/59), chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO, which subsequently evolved into the MG1A3, and later the Bundeswehr's MG 3, Italian MG 42/59 and Austrian MG 74. It also spawned the Yugoslav unlicensed nearly identical Zastava M53. Mechanism roller locked action diagram In roller locked arms in the locked position during firing the rollers rest on parallel surfaces relative to the bore axis on the bolt head, so no amount of force pushing back on the bolt can cause the bolt to unlock. When chambering a fresh cartridge the bolt head is used to push out the rollers. For that the bolt head ends in an angled/oblique wedge to smoothly move the rollers outwards into their lockup position. Roller locking is used by the CZ 52 pistol. Slide, barrel, locking piece and rollers are shown here. Normally the recoil spring pushes the locking piece rearward, which in turn pushes the barrel back and holds the locking rollers. (In some of these pictures the spring is removed) When the gun is fired, the barrel, slide and locking piece (right side of picture) will move backwards a short distance, while the locking piece will be stopped by a tab on the frame, shown on the left with a stick pointing out the mating surface. With the locking piece stopped by the tab, the rollers will continue rearward with the slide, until they reach the recessed portion of the locking piece. The rollers will then be allowed to move inward, and will release from their indentations in the slide releasing the slide from the barrel. At about the same time, the barrel will be stopped by the locking piece. Momentum will carry the slide back against the pressure of the recoil spring where extraction and feeding a fresh cartridge happen similarly to other designs. As the slide moves forward, the locking piece maintains outward pressure on the rollers. When the recesses in the slide are positioned with the rollers, the locking piece will push them out into the recesses and move forward, locking the barrel to the slide again, the barrel and slide will move forward a small amount and stop. Unlike a standard Browning short-recoil action, there is no tipping of the barrel during operation. Other locking systems with similarities Roller-delayed blowback as in the HK G3, where similar rollers are used is sometimes mistakenly called roller locked, but there is no genuine locking of the bolt and no recoiling of the barrel in delayed blowback action as the rollers rest on angled/oblique surfaces, so applying a backwards force on the bolt will cause it to unlock. The flapper locking method and roller locking are similar in concept. Other systems with many similarities to the roller locked system includes the ball bearing roller locking system used in Ansch√ºtz 1827 Fortner and Heym SR 30, and the radial locking system used in the Blaser R8 and R93 which uses an expanding collet in a similar fashion.

El Capitan, with its intimidating 3000 foot face, was out of the question for at least a few years, leaving Half Dome, with a much more manageable 2000 foot face, as the logical next goal.Roper, Steve. Camp 4: Recollections of a Yosemite Rockclimber. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 1998. Roper, Steve. Climber's Guide to Yosemite Valley. San Francisco, CA: Sierra Club Books, 1978. The first attempt to climb it was made in 1954 by Dick Long, Jim Wilson, and George Mandatory. However, they only managed to climb 175 feet before retreating. A more serious attempt to find passage up this cliff was made in 1955 by Jerry Gallwas, Don Wilson, Royal Robbins and Warren Harding. After climbing a mere 500 feet over five days, this party, too, retreated. Gallwas and Robbins, armed with new chrome- molybdenum pitons made by Gallwas, recruited Mike Sherrick and set off on June 24, 1957, determined this time to finish the route. Over a period of five days, they encountered repeated obstacles and they surmounted all these difficulties. Five days after they had left the ground, they stood at the summit. Warren Harding had hiked up the backside of Half Dome via the hikers' trail for the occasion. He had been planning, along with Mark Powell and Bill \\"Dolt\\" Feuerer, to give the route another attempt, but had been beaten to it by the successful team. Nevertheless, Harding offered the triumphant team a warm congratulations. Over the Fourth of July Weekend in 2015, a major rockfall occurred on the Regular Northwest Face, severely altering pitches 10 and 11. In September 2016, Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers climbed the route to assess its condition. The rockfall left clean slabs that can be climbed via bolt ladders and a pendulum with a tricky knot-toss rope maneuver. The Regular Northwest Face route tends to avoid areas that are likely to pose further rockfall hazard. However, much of the rock on Half Dome is alpine in nature, and it is often quite loose. In his book, Shaded by Stone, climber and author Ari Schneider recalls a giant teetering triangle-shaped rock in the center of Half Dome looming over the approach known as the Death Slabs. There is speculation that much more rock will exfoliate off other routes on Half Dome in the near future.

He played a major part in establishing the Icelandic community in Manitoba. Jonasson served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1896 to 1899 and again from 1907 to 1910, as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party. Jonasson was born to a farm family at Bakki in √ñxnadalur, Iceland, and was home-educated. He moved to Canada in 1872, and soon entered a profitable business partnership in Ontario. Appointed an immigration agent by the Ontario government in 1874, he succeeded in redirecting the flow of Icelandic immigration to Canada, most of his countrymen having previously gone to the United States. In 1875, he helped select an Icelandic reserve called New Iceland in Keewatin District, Northwest Territory, including the area around present-day Gimli. Jonasson was also instrumental in the founding of Framfari (Progress) in 1877, the first Icelandic-language newspaper on the North American continent. During a major exodus from New Iceland in 1879-1881, Jonasson established a sawmill and transportation company at Icelandic River (Riverton)in partnership with Fridjon Fridriksson, thus providing employment and stabilizing the settlement. In 1881 New Iceland was incorporated into Manitoba and in 1887 residents adopted municipal government. Though he moved to Selkirk and later to Winnipeg to manage his business interests, Jonasson remained a strong supporter of the settlement, for which reason he became known as the 'Father of New Iceland'. He was also instrumental in finally convincing CPR officials to extend the railway to Gimli in 1906, Arborg in 1910, and Riverton in 1914, and is thus responsible for the development of these thriving communities through the following decades. He was, along with Einar Hj√∂rleifsson Kvaran a key founder of the Icelandic newspaper L√∂gberg (Tribune), still published in Winnipeg in 2009, Jonasson also acted as the paper's editor from 1895 to 1901. He first campaigned for the Manitoba Legislature in the 1896 provincial election, and defeated his cousin, Conservative Party candidate Baldwin Baldwinson, by 79 votes in the St. Andrews constituency. The Liberal Party won this election under Thomas Greenway's leadership, and Jonasson served as a government backbencher for the next three years. Following redistribution, Jonasson campaigned in the 1899 election for the new constituency of Gimli, and lost to Baldwinson by eight votes. The Gimli election was deferred for a week after the rest of the province had voted, and a provincial Conservative majority had already been announced. The federal government of Wilfrid Laurier appointed Jonasson a Homestead Inspector for the Interlake District in 1901. He retained the post until 1906. He was then returned to the provincial assembly in the 1907 election, defeating Baldwinson by 156 votes. The Conservatives won this election, and Jonasson served for the next three years as an opposition member. He did not seek re-election in 1910. Jonasson helped to establish a co-operative agricultural marketing scheme for Icelandic farmers in 1907, and became the co-owner of a slaughterhouse in Winnipeg. The venture failed, and Jonasson was widely criticized in the Icelandic community for his role. He does not appear to have been wealthy in his later years. In 1930, Jonasson represented Canada at the millennium anniversary of Iceland's parliament. The government of Manitoba established a commemorative plaque in his honour in 1983.

He is responsible for two notable 14th- century portolan charts, the \\"Dalorto\\" chart of 1325 and the \\"Dulcert\\" chart of 1339. The latter is the first portolan known to have been produced in Palma, and considered the founding piece of the Majorcan cartographic school. He is also believed to be the author of a third undated and unsigned chart held in London.Caraci (1959), Campbell (1987, 2011).  Background  Virtually nothing is known of Angelino Dulceti/Dolcet/Dalorto/Dulcert. A common assumption is that he was an Italian of Liguria, who trained in Genoa and subsequently emigrated to Majorca some time in the 1320s or 1330s.e.g. Crone (1962: p.114) Angelino 'Dalorto' was once thought connected to the notable Genoese \\"Dell' Orto\\" family. The latter were known to be active in the Black Sea and the Asian trade, e.g. in 1340, Pope Benedict XII speaks of receiving a Petraneus da Lorto, former Genoese governor of Caffa and emissary of Uzbeg Khan of the Golden Horde.Beazley (1906: p.249) It was conjectured that Angelino Dalorto moved to Majorca, possibly as a commercial agent for his family's trading house, and took up the name 'Dulcert' as a more Catalan- sounding version of his surname.Beazley (1906: p.522), Nansen (1911: p.226) However, more recent readings claim the signatures on the maps have been previously misread, that the 'Dalorto' in the 1325 chart should be read as \\"Dulceto\\" and the \\"Dulcert\\" in the 1339 chart is in fact \\"Dulceti\\".Pujades (2007: p.491). This in fact had been proposed over a century earlier by P. Amat di S.Filippo (1888: 272-73) This implies Angelino originates from Dulceto, or Dulcedo, a small Italian town in Liguria, a little down the coast from Genoa. This reinforces the common assumption that he was an Italian immigrant who settled in Majorca. However, others have noted the existence of the \\"Dolcet\\" surname in earlier Majorcan records.e.g. Duro (1892: p.285) The identity and nationality of Angelino Dulceti/Dolcet/Dalorto/Dulcert has been a longstanding item of contention between scholars, often attenuated by nationalist sentiments.For a taste of the old controversy, see Gabriel Marcel (1887: p.28-35), P. Amat di S. Filippo (1888: p.268), Llabr√©s (1890: p.347), Duro (1892, p.283, Bl√°zquez (1906: p.232), A. Magnaghi(1909). For a modern reprise, see Winter (1958), Caraci (1959, 1960), Crone (1962). Scholars who seek to claim Dulcert to be wholly of Catalan, nationality have tended to argue that Dalorto and Dulcert are two different men, that the Catalan Dulcert might simply have been \\"inspired\\" by the Genoese Dalorto. Pujades (2007), touching only briefly on the controversy, concludes  Dalorto 1325 Map  Part of 1325 portolan of Angelino Dalorto Angelino \\"Dalorto\\" is known for a portolan chart commonly dated 1325 (now revised to 1330), privately held by the Prince Corsini collection in Florence.A copy of the \\"Dalorto 1325\\" map is reproduced in Hinks (1929) and can be found online at Internet Culturale . For a detailed description see Magnaghi (1899: p.506ff) Its signature was traditionally read as \\"Hoc opus fecit Angelinus de Dalorto ano d√±i MCCXXV de mense martii composuit hoc\\" (and since re-read as \\"Angelinus de Dulceto'\\" and \\"ano d√±i MCCXXX\\", thus the revision of the name to \\"Dulceto\\" and the year to 1330).Pujades (2007), P. Amat di S.Filippo (1888: p.273) In many ways, the 1325 Dalorto portolan marks a transition point in European portolans, between the Genoese and Majorcan cartographic schools. For the most part, Dalorto follows the restrained coast-focused Italian style, exemplified by the early portolans of his Genoese predecessor Pietro Vesconte, but he also begins moving away from its sparseness by illustrating inland details, such as miniature cities, mountain ranges and rivers, a tendency will flourish in the later Majorcan school. Indeed, some of Dalorto's details here presage the standard Majorcan stylings (e.g. Red Sea colored red, the Atlas Mountains shaped like a palm tree, the chicken-foot Alps, the Danube's \\"hillocks\\"). Among its advances in geographic knowledge, the Dalorto map gives a better picture of northern Europe (particularly the Baltic Sea) than its predecessors.Nansen,p.227) The Dalorto chart is also the first to depict the legendary island of Brasil, as circular disk-shaped island southwest of Ireland. It is denoted by the caption \\"Insula de montonis siue de brazile\\" (\\"isle of sheep (?) or of brasil\\").Nansen (1906: p.228). Nansen (p.229n3) connects \\"montonis\\" to the French mouton (sheep), but considers alternative readings.  Dulcert 1339 Map  Map of Angelino Dulcert Angelino \\"Dulcert\\" is known for a portolan chart dated 1339 and held by the Bibliotheque Nationale de France in Paris, France (B.696). Its signature reads: \\"ano MCCCXXXVIIII mense Augusto Angelino Dulcert in civitate Maioricarum composuit\\".Beazley, 1906: p.522 Unlike its predecessor, it is composed not on a single vellum, but on two parchment pages, joined together as a single map, measuring 75 √ó 102 cm. Made in Palma, the Dulcert 1339 map is considered the founding piece of the Majorcan cartographic school. Although some of its features were already presaged in the Dalorto map, it goes further in the inland illustrations, in particular including miniature illustrations of people. In many ways, the Dulcert 1339 map is very similar to the 1325 Dalorto map.Campbell (1987) On the other hand, the portolan's keys and legends are written in Latin, and it contains features not usually found on Genoese or Venetian portolans.As noted above, however, Pujades (2007: 491) however, concludes that there is \\"no room for doubt about the Genoese provenance of his cartographic-toponymic pattern\\". The 1339 Dulcert map is notable for giving the first modern depiction of the island of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands, as Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus, a reference to the Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello, and affixes a Genoese shield to mark the island (a custom which will be retained by future mapmakers). Dulcert also introduces what seems like the Madeira islands, named here as Capraria and Canaria (legendary names for two of the Fortunate Islands of classical antiquity, as found in, e.g. Ptolemy).Beazley, p.522 The oldest heraldic representation connected with Macedonia surviving to the present time, or discovered so far, is the banner of Skopje, on the Dulcert 1339 Map, with blazon: Or, double-headed eagle Gules. Above the name of the city of \\"Scopi\\" is written \\"Servia\\" (Serbia).  London c. 1340 map  In the 20th century, a third map has emerged, which is unsigned and which has become commonly attributed to Angelino Dulceti/Dolcet/Dalorto/Dulcert on account of its features. It is held by the British Library in London, UK (Add.MS.25691). It thought to have been composed sometime in the 1340s, although some scholars have suggested it may even precede the Dalorto 1325 map.Winter (1958) is among the few who consider the London chart the earliest of the Dulceti trio. This is disputed by Caraci (1959) and Crone (1962). Campbell (1987, 2011) and Pujades (2007) date it between 1339 and 1350, probably 1340.

His findings have been featured in scholarly journals, and in publications including Science, The New York Times, Discover and National Geographic. McHenry earned bachelor's and master's degrees at UC Davis before earning his Ph.D. at Harvard. Efficient Walker theory Attempting to explain the evolutionary advent of bipedalism among hominids, McHenry and Peter Rodman have advanced the Efficient Walker theory, based on energetic analysis. The scientists compared the efficiency of chimpanzees walking on two versus four legs, finding two legged locomotion was far more efficient. They concluded bipedalism was selected simply because it allowed for a further range of travel for hominids. As Miocene forests decreased and hominids were forced into the savannas, the scientists reason, bipedalism enabled greater access to resources. Study of African ancestors McHenry travels regularly to Africa to extend his knowledge of human origins, focusing his studies on the fossil remains of australopithecines.

It lies 10 miles north-west of Barnstaple, near Woolacombe and Lee Bay, and is sited in a valley within the hilly sand-dune-like land behind Morte Point, almost directly above Woolacombe. The parish population at the 2011 census was 1,637. History Mortehoe can trace its origins back to the Domesday Book, and beyond. Always a farming community, in former years it was a base for smugglers and wreckers. Since the coming of the railway in the 19th Century, notably the Ilfracombe Branch Line, Mortehoe became much more dependent on tourism, with numerous camp sites and holiday camps in the vicinity. Geology Mortehoe, like most of the surrounding area, is built on a band of Devonian Slates, Sandstones and Igneous rocks such as Basalt. This gives the area a rugged and rocky quality which is typical of North Devon. Transport links Mortehoe may be reached by road from two directions: either a steep, narrow lane (20% Gradient) that follows the hilly coast north from Woolacombe; or else a twisty, narrow road from the east. There are regular bus services from Woolacombe and Ilfracombe. The popularity of this remote corner of Devon was boosted by the coming of the railway in 1874. However, Mortehoe station was nearly two miles inland from the village, so Mortehoe was rather less affected by the additional population than its now much larger neighbour, Woolacombe. The Ilfracombe Branch Line railway closed in 1970. Places of interest Cottages at Mortehoe The Mortehoe Heritage Centre, based in the Cart Linhay building. On the upper floor is a museum of the history of the most north-westerly tip of North Devon. The museum has displays about the local farming communities, the railway, and the numerous shipwrecks that occurred off the treacherous rocks around the nearby coast. The rebuilding of the heritage site was managed by surveyor, and later landlord, Douglas Victor Watkins. Bull Point Lighthouse is a short walk along the South West Coast Path from the centre of the village, and Morte Point is also easily accessible. =Parish church= St Mary's Church, Mortehoe The village contains the historic church of St Mary's, Morthoe which dates back to Norman times, but has been added to in later years.

They are strictly parasitic on earthworms; the females lay their eggs near earthworm burrows, and the larvae then feed on the worms. Cluster flies seek refuge in cold weather and find their way into attic spaces and similar areas indoors. They often emerge on warm days, and cluster at windows attempting to exit(hence the name). Pollenia sp. on leaves in a forest The typical grass fly Pollenia rudis is about 7 mm long and can be recognised by distinct lines or stripes behind the head, short golden-coloured hairs on the thorax, and irregular light and dark gray areas on the abdomen. Cluster flies are typically slow-moving. Cluster flies have a widespread distribution. Eight species are found in Britain and 31 in Europe. Pollenia species are also numerous in Australia and New Zealand (over 30 species); they are common in North America. P. rudis has spread widely in association with humans.

Toward the end of the seventeenth century, rumors began circulating in print about the club and its annual meeting held on 30 January, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I by decapitation. The club is mentioned by Samuel Wesley, a dissenter who later conformed to the Anglican Church, in the anonymous A Letter from a Country Divine to his Friend in London Concerning the Education of Dissenters in their Private Academies (1703). Wesley claimed to have attended a meeting in 1693 where dissenters blasphemed the memory of Charles I, \\"discoursing of their Calves-head Club\\" and a \\"Design they had at their next Calves-Head Feast, to have a Cold Pye serv'd on the Table, with either a Live-Cat or Hare ... and they had contriv'd to put one of their Company who lov'd Monarchy, and knew nothing of the matter, to cut it up; whereupon, and on the leaping out of the Cat or Hare, they were all to set up a Shout, and cry, Haloo! Old Puss!‚Äîto the Honour of the Good Old Cause, and to shew their affection to a Commonwealth.\\" Wesley's biographer Henry D. Rack comments, \\"It was probably not, as is usually claimed, a meeting of the so-called Calve's Head Club, whose reputation in any case may owe much to tory propaganda. ... Publication was timed to reinforce the current attacks on dissenters and especially on their academies.\\"Rack, Henry D. \\"Wesley, Samuel,\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, published in print 23 September 2004, and online 23 September 2004. The main source for propaganda concerning the Calves' Head Club was the popular work written at least in some part by Tory sympathizer Edward Ward (1667-1731), The secret history of the Calves-Head Club, or The Republican unmasqu'd, wherein is fully shewn the religion of the Calves-Head heroes, in their anniversary thanksgiving songs on the thirtieth of January, by them called anthems; for the years 1693, 1694, 1695, 1696, 1697. Now published, to demonstrate the restless, implacable spirit of a certain party still among us, who are never to be satisfied till the present establishment in church and state is subverted. The work was published in 1703 and reprinted fifteen times between 1703 and 1721. \\"I was inform'd,\\" the narrator relates, According to The Secret History, after the banquet a copy of the Eikon Basilike (the \\"Royal Portrait,\\" supposedly printed from the diary of Charles I) was burned while \\"anthems\\" were sung. A calf's skull was filled with wine or another liquor and members toasted \\"The Pious Memory of those worthy Patriots that had kill'd the Tyrant, and deliver'd their Country from his Arbitrary Sway.\\" The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica claimed that the club survived till 1734, when the diners were mobbed owing to the popular ill- feeling which their outrages on good taste provoked, and the riot which ensued put a final stop to the meetings.

It was published on February 1, 1999. It marks the first appearance of the Turbo Toilet 2000, the Talking Toilets, and the Incredible Robo-Plunger, as well as George and Harold's nerdy tattletale nemesis Melvin Sneedly. Plot summary JH Elementary School is planning on hosting its second annual Invention Convention. Upon seeing the poster for it, George and Harold think to themselves what it would be like to be principals for the day, but Mr. Krupp bans George and Harold from the convention this year and puts them in study hall all day because last year‚Äôs Invention Convention had to be called off as a result of them putting glue in everyone‚Äôs seats except their own. While getting ready to secretly sabotage everyone's inventions after thinking it isn't fair, the two boys run into Melvin Sneedly, who is busy working on his invention, the PATSY 2000, a photocopier that can make a simple two-dimensional image come alive. He demonstrates by putting in a photo of a mouse; out comes a real one, going on the floor. George and Harold assume Melvin put the real mouse in earlier, but they promise not to sabotage it, as long as he doesn't report them and eventually promises. Because of George and Harold's pranks, the convention has to be called off again, and Melvin breaks George and Harold's promise and tattles on them after Mr. Krupp is left confused as he knows that he had thought he put George and Harold in study hall. An infuriated Mr. Krupp throws them in detention for the rest of the school year, threatening them with suspension if they leave the classroom once for any reason. George and Harold get assigned writing lines for two hours after school. With each boy using a quick line-writing device, they write all their lines in three-and-a-half minutes, then they pass the time by making a new Captain Underpants comic: Captain Underpants and the attack of the Talking Toilets. They decide to go to the copy machine, but realize that Mr. Krupp will suspend them if they leave the room and they decide to sneak out without Mr. Krupp catching them. However, the copy machine is surrounded by most of the teachers, so they copy off of Melvin's machine as they still believe it is a normal copy machine, but the talking toilets come to life as George and Harold discover that Melvin was right all along as they make a run for it. While fleeing, George and Harold are eventually caught red-handed by Mr. Krupp who was walking in the hallway and are suspended. The boys try to explain what happened in the gym, but Mr. Krupp refuses to listen and doesn't care since George and Harold are suspended and orders them to leave the school, much to George and Harold's dismay. All the teachers celebrate in the gym with Ms. Anthrope notifying George and Harold's parents to tell them the news and Ms. Ribble destroying George and Harold's desks, but the trouble begins when Mr. Meaner, the gym teacher, is promptly eaten by one of the toilets. Ms. Ribble then snaps her fingers at a toilet, making Mr. Krupp turn into Captain Underpants. George and Harold chase him as he takes several pairs of underwear from unsuspecting clothes lines. Back at school, the trio finds only Ms. Ribble on the toilet table. The trio slings chipped beef with his underwear, and the toilets vomit all the teachers out and die. Soon after, the Turbo Toilet 2000 bursts out of the school and despite Captain Underpants's efforts, he swallows Captain Underpants whole. The boys sneak into Melvin's machine to make a super-powered robot called the Incredible Robo-Plunger 2000, which plunges its plunger into the Turbo Toilet 2000's mouth, letting the boys save Mr. Krupp. He fears that he will be fired for the damages, but the Robo-Plunger repairs all of it, and flies off to Uranus with the command never to return. In return, Mr. Krupp cancels their detention and as the principals, the boys hold an all-day carnival for the students and put the teachers (and Melvin for his tattling) in detention. At the end of the day, Mr. Krupp questions how the carnival will be paid for; and the boys reveal they sold his antique furniture and some more items. Mr. Krupp gets furious, and Miss Anthrope snaps her fingers after the boys, making Mr. Krupp become Captain Underpants again. =Comics= Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets In another normal day at school, a UFO shoots rays at the school, which gives the toilets life to eat everyone at the school. Captain Underpants appears and places plungers in the toilets' mouths, then the toilets' leader, the Turbo Toilet 2000, appears and Captain Underpants gives it a wedgie on a stop sign, from where it's slung at the UFO, causing both to explode. The Top Secret Truth About Captain Underpants George and Harold want everyone to know what happened in The Adventures of Captain Underpants. They make this comic book for everyone to know. The story involves 3 parts. A similar comic with added details appears in every subsequent sequel. =Part 1= George and Harold get introduced as two cool kids. It says that everyone loves their homemade Captain Underpants comics except for their principal, Mr. Krupp. =Part 2= It goes to when Mr. Krupp blackmails George and Harold, so they buy the 3D Hypno-Ring and hypnotize Mr. Krupp into believing he is Captain Underpants. He jumps out of the window and heads to an old warehouse that was Dr. Diaper's Base. but before he can get in, it explodes and he runs away along with George and Harold who had been running after him the whole time. =Part 3= It shows them heading back to school when George pours water on Captain Underpants's head which turns him back to Mr. Krupp. George and Harold warn everyone not to snap their fingers around Mr. Krupp for then he will turn back into Captain Underpants. So now nobody snaps their fingers and there is peace throughout the whole entire village.

They were also known as \\"Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio\\" and the \\"Johnny Burnette Trio\\". The members of the Trio were Dorsey Burnette, his younger brother Johnny, and a friend Paul Burlison. Dorsey and Johnny Burnette were both natives of Memphis, having been born there in 1932 and 1934 respectively. Paul Burlison was born in Brownsville, Tennessee, in 1929, but moved to Memphis with his family in 1937. Formation The Burnette brothers were keen amateur boxers and became Golden Gloves champions. In 1949, Dorsey met Paul Burlison, also a Golden Gloves champion, at an amateur boxing tournament in Memphis. The two became firm friends, and through this friendship Burlison would also meet Johnny Burnette. All three had an interest in music, and in 1951 they began playing together at the hillbilly nightspots on the outskirts of Memphis, both as a trio and as a part of other groups. In these early days, they played a mixture of country and bluegrass, not untainted with cottonpatch blues. In the honkytonks in and around Memphis the Trio would often play an upbeat country and blues so that the patrons had music to do the 1940-1950s bop and jitterbug, popular at the time, and the sound later called rockabilly, which they perfected in their 1956 Coral Records album. Johnny and Dorsey Burnette were reported to be early performers on the 'Saturday Night Jamboree', which was a local stage show held every Saturday night at the Goodwyn Institute Auditorium in downtown Memphis in 1953-54. The show was founded by Joe Manuel, who had been a popular hillbilly radio star of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1952 or 1953, they formed a group with Burlison playing lead guitar, Dorsey playing stand-up bass and Johnny playing rhythm guitar and taking the vocal lead. Occasionally they were joined by steel guitarist Albert Vescovo and fiddler Tommy Seeley. With this line-up and at this time, the group may have been known as the Rhythm Rangers. A contemporary poster from the Von Theater in Boonville, Tennessee, which advertised The Dixieland Jamboree, puts, as the top of the bill, Johnny Burnett & his Rhythm Rangers and describes him as a VON recording artist from Memphis, Tennessee. Second on this bill is Hayden Thomson and his Southern Melody Boys, who are described as Just Back from WSM Nashville, Tennessee. and Ernest Tubb Jamboree. Early The trio together with Tommy Seeley and Albert Vescovo had their first recording session with the Von Theater in Boonville, which booked the Burnettes and other talent from out of town. Hayden Thompson, who also recorded for Von, has asserted that the label was unconnected with the theatre. Music writer Adam Komorowski, however, states that the label owner Sam Thomas had named the label after the theatre. The session was arranged and paid for by Eddie Bond's father, Bill Bond, who wanted to manage the band. The Record Exchanger No. 26, however, noted that the session was set up and A & R'd by Buddy Bain, a disc-jockey and performer in Corinth, Mississippi. Their first single was \\"You're Undecided\\"(any early indication of their rockabilly style) backed with \\"Go Mule Go\\" (Von 1006), released under the name Johnny Burnette. It sold fewer than 200 copies. There is some disagreement over the year in which this single was released. The Guinness Book Of Rock Stars suggests that the year was 1953, but other sources suggest 1954, and others suggest November 1955. The trio were said to have auditioned for Sun Records but were turned down by Sam Phillips, apparently because they sounded too much like Elvis Presley. Whether or not this audition took place, however, remains a matter of dispute. Dorsey Burnette has stated that they recorded a demo session for Sun. He said, \\"We took Sam Phillips some songs and he turned 'em down, but they weren't very good anyway.\\" In an article for TV Radio Mirror, Johnny Burnette recalled that he and Dorsey had auditioned for Sun Records and had been chased back onto the street when the fiddler's bridge broke. No tapes of any such audition have ever been found, although this could be explained by the fact that Sam Phillips was prone to record over tapes. More importantly, however, Burlison later insisted that the group did not audition at Sun at all, and he recalled the incident of the fiddler's bridge taking place during the recording of \\"Go Mule Go\\". If they did not, they were one of the few KWEM regulars not to do so. As the trio was only a loose aggregation until 1956, then it is possible that the Burnettes may have auditioned at Sun without Burlison. Sources also vary as to the time of the alleged audition. Some suggest 1954, but others have put it in early 1956, with only Dorsey and Johnny Burnette present. From 1954 to February 1956, the trio played at the Hideaway Club in Middleton, Tennessee, with the Doc MacQueen Swing Band. As well as their work with the band they were to have an intermission spot of their own, and by 1956 the trio had built a strong reputation in and around Memphis. But the earnings from these session did not provide them with enough on which to live, and so all three had daytime jobs. Both Paul Burlison and Dorsey Burnette were working for the Crown Electric Company as journeyman and apprentice electrician respectively, and Johnny held down a number of jobs, including one selling dishes and appliances door to door, another as a Repo Man and also as a deck hand on barges traversing the Mississippi River. In February/March 1956, Paul Burlison and Dorsey Burnette were laid off from Crown Electric. As they both needed to secure regular pay- cheques, they decided to drive to New York in the hope of gaining jobs there through the electrician's union. Paul Burlison was to later recall that \\"they could not make it alone on what they were being paid on Friday and Saturday nights at the Hideaway. So we thought, until things picked up in Memphis, they would go to New York and work awhile.\\" After discussing the move with their wives and other family members, the trio drove to New York through one of the worst snowstorms to hit the Northeast in many years. They stopped off briefly in Brownsville in order to inform Doc McQueen of their move. McQueen is reported to have said, \\"Let me know if you make it big.\\" When they arrived in New York, they took rooms in the YMCA. Paul and Dorsey started work as electricians, and Johnny worked in the garment district. They then found out about the Wednesday night auditions for the Ted Mack Original Amateur Hour, and they joined the endless queue of show business hopefuls. Elvis Presley had only hit the big time in late January 1956, and someone in the Mack audition crew thought that the Burnettes and Burlison might reach the same market. So they were given the fast track and appeared on the show, which was networked nationally by ABC. They won three straight appearances in April and May 1956, which gained them a slot on the finalists' tour on 9 September 1956, their appearance being unfortunately telecast live from New York opposite to that of Elvis Presley's first appearance at the Ed Sullivan Show which was also beamed live from Los Angeles, and capturing the highest share in the history of US television, an 82.6%, which meant the finals of the Arthur Godfrey Show were seen by less than 5 million viewers. A newspaper clip on the day after their third win on the Ted Mack Show referred to them as \\"the Rock and Roll Boys from Memphis\\". Between their second and third appearances, they were spotted by Bill Randle, who was a disc-jockey on WERE, Cleveland. Randle telephoned his friend Henry Jerome, who was a band leader at the Hotel Edison at the time, and he told Jerome to watch the trio's next appearance on television. Jerome was impressed by what he saw that he contacted the Burnettes and Burlison and signed them to a management contract. He got Johnny a daytime job as an elevator operator at the Hotel Edison and moved the trio there from the YMCA. He secured a contract for the trio with GAC (General Artist Corporation) and with the Coral division of Decca Records. Paul Burlison was to say later that he believed that they made a mistake by signing with Coral Records. \\"Capitol Records was after us, ABC Paramount, Chess and Decca,\\" Burlison remembered. \\"I wanted to go to Capitol but they said it didn't matter, a hit record would make us rich.\\" It was at this time that the Burnettes and Burlison formally adopted the name of the Rock and Roll Trio. This was something of a compromise, which was reached after Johnny's suggestion of the Burnette Brothers had been countered by Burlison's suggestion of the Burlison Brothers. They had already rejected the name, the Rock and Roll Boys from Memphis. Jerome also set up a corporation called Pajad (PA-ul, J-ohnny A-nd D-orsey) Enterprises in which the proceeds of their earnings were to be split equally for five years. Jerome placed the boys on salary and he would later cut himself in for composer's royalties on some of the tunes, working under the pseudonym of Al Mortimer. After signing with Coral, the Rock and Roll Trio were placed with A & R director Bob Thiele, who took them to the Pythian Temple in New York City for their first recording session. The Pythian Temple was where Bill Haley & His Comets had cut \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". The first session was held on 7 May 1956, and before the session began, Johnny, Dorsey and Paul were surprised to find the 32-piece Dick Jacobs Orchestra sitting in the studio. They were to be paid the union scale of $41.25 each to sit and watch the Rock and Roll Trio perform their original rockabilly tunes. Only the drummer, Eddie Gray, who had his own group called Eddie Gray and the Commanders, was used on the sessions. The session began with \\"Shattered Dreams\\", which was a George Motola tune. The Rock and Roll Trio did not feel comfortable with it, and the results were considered unsuitable for commercial release. Bob Thiele had, however, listened to the early Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley recordings, and he talked to the boys about creating their own sound. He had decided that a sound awash in treble would be the key to success. He told Burlison to turn up the treble on the amp, which created a pinched, stinging tone to Paul's lead guitar. The rest of the session produced four songs, \\"Midnight Train\\", \\"Tear It Up\\", \\"Oh Baby Babe\\" and a reprise of the old Von cut \\"You're Undecided\\". On May 26, 1956, Coral released the Trio's first single \\"Tear It Up\\" backed with \\"You're Undecided\\" (Coral 61651), and they jumped into Dorsey's 1955 Ford for appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, Steve Allen's Tonight Show and Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall. They were on their way as a touring act and ready to bring rockabilly into American homes. The record sold strongly in many markets, becoming a hit in Boston and Baltimore, but it failed to make the national charts. With only one single left in the can, Coral rushed Johnny, Paul and Dorsey back into the studio, but this time it was to be in Owen Bradley's Studio at 804 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee, from July 2‚Äì5, 1956 and teamed up with Buddy Harman on drums for the full session and the great Grady Martin on guitar for July 5. These sessions were judged to have been enormously successful, and on August 4, 1956, Coral released a second single: \\"Midnight Train\\" backed with \\"Oh, Baby Babe\\" (Coral 61675). This again failed to make the national charts, and without a hit record, the trio needed to play live dates in order to promote themselves and more particularly to earn money. During the summer of 1956, they toured with Ted Mack's Touring show and with Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent. On September 9, 1956, they appeared on the final of the Ted Mack Original Amateur Hour at Madison Square Garden, where amongst other songs, they played \\"Tear It Up\\" and \\"Hound Dog\\". As a result of this appearance, on October 13, 1956, Coral issued their third single, \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" backed with \\"Honey Hush\\" (Coral 616719), but again, it failed make the national charts. Having used a drummer on their Nashville recording sessions, it was decided to add a drummer to their line-up. When the Trio told Carl Perkins that they were looking for a drummer, Perkins recommended his cousin Tony Austin, who had played a few dates with him around their hometown of Jackson, Tennessee before he had recruited W. S. Holland. Following Perkins' recommendation, the Burnettes swung through to pick him up, and Austin became part of the group. After Austin was hired, Henry Jerome started billing the group as Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio on live dates. This name was used on their first two singles, and on their third single they were known as The Johnny Burnette Trio. Dorsey was incensed by this as he had taken the lead on a few songs, including \\"Sweet Love On My Mind\\", \\"My Love You¬¥re A Stranger\\" and \\"Blues Stay Away From Me\\". He wanted to retain the more democratic name Rock and Roll Trio despite the fact that the group was now a quartet. The band was constantly on the road, completing what seemed to be an endless stream of one-night stands in order to cover their living expenses. This exhausting regime led to squabbles, which were exacerbated by lack of chart success. These squabbles finally came to a head at a gig in Niagara Falls in the Fall of 1956, where, after a fight, Dorsey quit the group and handed back his band uniform. This happened a week before the Trio were due to appear in Alan Freed's movie Rock, Rock, Rock. New line-up Burlison and Johnny Burnette hastily recruited Johnny Black, the brother of Elvis's bassist Bill Black, as a replacement for Dorsey, and his uniform was cut down to Johnny Black's size. The remains of Pajad Corp. bought Black an acoustic bass and placed him on salary. He joined the group in time to be filmed in their spot in the movie, where they played Lonesome Train (On A Lonesome Track). To coincide with the release of the film, a fourth Coral single, \\"Lonesome Train (On A Lonesome Track)\\" backed with \\"I Just Found Out\\" (Coral 61758), was released on January 5, 1957, under the name of the Johnny Burnette Trio, but, like the group's earlier releases, it failed to chart. In the meantime, Dorsey returned to Memphis and found himself a lead guitarist and a bassist whilst he switched to rhythm guitar and vocals. Calling themselves Dorsey Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio, they briefly toured the South before calling it quits. Despite their earlier failures, Coral still seemed to have faith in the commercial future of the Rock and Roll Trio, even with their revamped line-up. On March 22, 1957 they organized what was to be the Trio's last recording session at the Bradley Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. On this occasion, however, the identity of the personnel involved is open to question. Adam Komorowski has stated that despite the split, Dorsey was forced to attend this session because of contractual obligations. According to the discography used by Colin Escott of Showtime Magazine, Dorsey, Johnny and Paul took part in this session. According to Nashville session double bassist Bob Moore who was present at the Nashville sessions, Dorsey and Paul were replaced by himself and Grady Martin. The 1957 sessions are clearly more in line with the contemporary Nashville sound of the day and without the same rockabilly upbeat tempos produced in the 1956 sessions of the trio recorded in New York, followed by Nashville 1956 sessions. French researchers Gilles Vignal and Marc Alesina, however, have produced a discography which has only Johnny Burnette present at the session. According to them, Burnette played acoustic guitar and sang vocals, whilst Thomas Grady Martin played electric guitar, Bob L. Moore played string bass and Farris Coursey was on drums. On this session, four tracks, \\"Touch Me\\", \\"If You Want Enough\\", \\"Butterfingers\\" and \\"Eager Beaver Baby\\" were cut. Taking a cue from Elvis and the Jordanaires, Owen Bradley lined up a vocal group for two tracks: \\"Butterfingers\\" and \\"If You Want It Enough\\". Following the session Burnett and the Trio toured with Gene Vincent, and in published snapshots, only Johnny Burnette, Paul Burlison and Johnny Black appear with Gene Vincent. On May 20, 1957, Coral released a fifth single, \\"Eager Beaver Baby\\" backed with \\"Touch Me\\" (Coral 61829), and on September 2, 1957 they released a sixth single \\"Drinking Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\" backed with \\"Butterfingers\\" (Coral 61869). In both cases, these singles were released under the name of Johnny Burnette, but neither of these releases had any chart success. Also in 1957, Coral released a 10\\" LP, which was entitled Johnny Burnette and the Rock 'n Roll Trio (Coral CRL 57080). It did not include their first single \\"Tear It Up\\". Split up By the Fall of 1957, the Trio had become dispirited by this lack of success, and they were tiring of the endless one-nighters, so they decided to split up. A seventh single, \\"If You Want It Enough\\" backed with \\"Rock Billy Boogie\\" (Coral 61918) was released on December 16, 1957, under the name of Johnny Burnette, but by that time, the Rock and Roll Trio was no more. The Burnette Brothers decided to move to California and try their luck there. Paul Burlison joined them there briefly but decided to return to Memphis and retire from the music business. Had the Burnettes decided to follow Burlison's example, then the Rock and Roll Trio may well have become just another forgotten 1950s group. The Burnette Brothers success as songwriters in 1958 and 1959 and their individual, but varying, degrees of success in 1960 and 1961 as solo artists helped to keep the group's memory alive. This success was to lead to one more single record release by Coral. In April 1960, following Johnny Burnette's success on Liberty Records as a solo artist, Coral released \\"Blues Stay Away From Me\\" backed with \\"Midnight Train\\" (Coral 62190), under the name Johnny and Dorsey Burnette. This record, like its predecessors, however, failed to chart. With the rise to fame in the 1960s of groups like the Beatles and the Yardbirds, with their professed admiration for the Rock and Roll Trio, interest in the group was rekindled. the Beatles covered \\"Lonesome Tears In My Eyes\\" and \\"Honey Hush\\" at live gigs and on BBC Radio. The Yardbirds, when Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page were part of the line-up, covered \\"The Train Kept A Rollin\\" and their own rewrite of that song, \\"Stroll On\\". \\"Stroll On\\" was featured in the 1966 Michelangelo Antonioni film Blow Up. British pirate radio DJ Mike Raven plugged the Trio's original 1957 LP, and this prompted Decca to reissue it as a 12\\" LP in Britain on their budget Ace of Hearts label in 1966. Around 1970, a second LP entitled Tear It Up, which contained much of their unreleased material from 1956/7, was also released. Ending Burnette died in a boating accident on Clear Lake, California, in August 1964, while Dorsey continued to write songs and remained successful in this field. He also continued performing and reached the US country chart with 15 minor hits during the 1970s, before he died of a heart attack in August 1979. Dorsey's death may well have prompted Paul Burlison to return to the music scene in the 1980s, first with Johnny Black and Tony Austin in a recreation of the Rock and Roll Trio. In 1997, he cut his first ever solo LP Train Kept A-Rollin on Sweetfish Records as a tribute to The Rock and Roll Trio. The LP contained eleven tracks, three of which, \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", \\"Lonesome Tears in My Eyes\\", and \\"Lonesome Train (on a Lonesome Track)\\", had been featured on the Rock and Roll Trio's original 1957 album. Among the backing musicians were Rocky Burnette (Johnny's son) and Billy Burnette (Dorsey's son). When asked about his post-Trio relationship with the Burnette Brothers, Paul Burlison made the following comments, \\"A year after I did that short tour with Johnny, I was working on my car one day and my wife called me to the phone. It was Dorsey and he told me that Johnny was missing out on a lake from San Francisco. He asked me to come out there and I left on the midnight flight. [...] We hadn't been too close since all the trouble, although Johnny and I had been real close. After that there wasn't two weeks went by that Dorsey and I didn't talk to each other until his death in 1979.\\" Paul Burlison died on September 27, 2003 in Horn Lake, Mississippi, from cancer. The pioneering contribution to the genre by all three of the original members of the Rock and Roll Trio has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.

The series of American children's books are about two fourth graders, George and Harold, and their mean principal Mr. Krupp, who can turn into Captain Underpants. It was published on September 1, 1999. It is the first book to feature the use of 'Extra-Strength Super Power Juice' (an invention of Zorx, Klax, and Jennifer, the antagonists of the book), which is used to give Captain Underpants superpowers later in the book. Plot Zorx, Klax and Jennifer, three evil extraterrestrials, land on the rooftop of Jerome Horwitz Elementary School, but nobody is aware that their spaceship is on the roof of the school. Meanwhile, George and Harold mess with their science teacher, then make the cafeteria ladies a fake recipe, disguised as \\"Mr. Krupp's Krispy Krupcakes\\" for Principal Krupp's birthday. The lunch ladies decide to surprise Mr. Krupp and make cupcakes for the entire school and the school is flooded with green goop. The next day, the lunch ladies tell Mr. Krupp about the mess, who gets very mad when he hears that they did it for his birthday. (\\"But it wasn't even my birthday!\\") Furious, the lunch ladies blame George and Harold, but Mr. Krupp needs proof to punish them. Furious from past harassment by the two boys, the lunch ladies quit. About 10 seconds after, the aliens come in, very badly disguised as humans and Mr. Krupp hires the three, unaware that they're actually bloodthirsty alien invaders in disguise as humans. For the boys' antics, Mr. Krupp forces them to eat their lunch in his office where he can keep an eye on the two boys, much to the boys' surprise. The next day, while Mr. Krupp has a banana, both boys have their own weird sandwiches and other food so junky, Mr. Krupp feels like he'll get sick and exits his office for some fresh air. After their lunch, George and Harold go off to change the letters on the sign in the cafeteria, only to find out that the sign is already changed by the aliens. They immediately notice that all of the students and staff at the school have become evil zombie nerds. Sneaking into the lunchroom, George and Harold learn that the aliens plan to feed the zombie nerds growth juice, turning them into giant minions bent on taking over the world. George and Harold steal the carton of growth juice and pour the contents out the window, most of which lands on a dandelion, turning it into the massive Dandelion of Doom. Mr. Krupp doesn't believe them, but starts to believe them after Miss Anthrope takes a bite out of his desk. When Harold escapes Zorx's grasp, he pulls off his gloves in the process. Zorx snaps his tentacle at them, turning Mr. Krupp into Captain Underpants, who, for some reason unknown, runs to the local shoe store for a cheeseburger. The boys temporarily defeat the aliens by Captain Underpants' return, but the three escape, soon into the alien spaceship, where they steal multiple cartoned juices, before the aliens lock them in their jail cell. While the aliens gloat, the boys switch the labels of the growth and self-destruct juices, along with the spray and fuel tanks. The trio jump off the spaceship before it explodes (killing Zorx, Klax, and Jennifer). They end up landing near the Dandelion of Doom, which begins to eat Captain Underpants. George reluctantly gives some of the \\"Extra-Strength Super Power Juice\\" to Captain Underpants, who kills the dandelion with his new powers. Harold mixes the Anti-Nerd Juice with root beer, which transforms the zombie nerds back. However, as a result of the Super Power Juice, Mr. Krupp (when Captain Underpants) permanently has superpowers. Comics =Wedgie Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Principal= A parody of Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, this book explains the events of the previous two books and how Captain Underpants and Mr. Krupp can change. =The Night of the Living Lunch Ladies= The Lunch Ladies are cleaning Friday's leftovers when the janitor locks them in the school, where they die by Sunday night. The janitor unknowingly buries them at a haunted hill. The Lunch Ladies rise from the dead and attack the gymnastics teacher. Captain Underpants came and tries to give them wedgies but it doesn't work. They get in a big fight and they all end up on a building. Captain Underpants uses the Toilet Paper of Justice to tie the ladies but they break free with the help of steak sauce. Captain Underpants then swings to safety in the toilet paper, while the lunch ladies fall to their deaths when they try to follow. =Dog Man: The Wrath of Petey (Full color version only)= Dog Man was the best cop of the world, but he only had one weakness. He was eating out of the garbage cans, rolling in the dead fish and sniffing the other dogs. The cops (even the chief) decided to give him a bath, but Dog Man ran away, because he doesn't like baths. The cops searched all around the city looking for Dog Man, but they couldn't find him anywhere. Soon, Petey decided that he should escape. He puts the newspaper in the toilet and he clogged the toilet by flushing the chain. The water from the toilet began going higher and higher and Petey escaped cat jail to his crime spree by robbing banks, stealing jewels and hi-jacking cars. But the cops could never catch them, they wish Dog Man would return. Meanwhile, Dog Man was hiding in an alley, eating out of a garbage can, and saw a newspaper. He felt ashamed, but he knew he must be brave and returned bravishly to stop Petey. He searched for him, picked up a trail, led straight to his house, but it was a trap. Petey sprayed water and Dog Man got scared, he ran away from Petey by digging a hole to the zoo. Dog Man came up in a cage where the skunks live and the skunks sprayed on Dog Man. Dog Man doesn't like too much stinky stuff. Petey ran out of the hole and he gets caught by a net. The cop said to Petey that he should go back to cat jail. While the cops washed Dog Man, Petey went back to cat jail. Dog Man was so clean, but then he rolled on the dead fish again. This comic was both seen on the full color version of the third Captain Underpants book in 2014 and Dog Man Unleashed in 2017.

J. Dennis. Produced and directed by Raymond Longford, the film stars Arthur Tauchert, Gilbert Emery, and Lottie Lyell, who also co-wrote the film with Longford. A major critical and commercial success upon its release in Australia, the film was also popular in New Zealand and Great Britain, and is generally considered the greatest Australian silent film, and one of the best Australian movies of all time.Paul Byrnes, 'The Sentimental Bloke', Australian Screenonline accessed 24 July 2012 The film inspired a sequel, Ginger Mick (1920), and a 1932 remake. In 2004, the National Film and Sound Archive released a fully restored version of The Sentimental Bloke, making it one of the few Australian silent films to survive intact. Plot Bill is a Woolloomooloo larrikin, who vows to abandon his life of gambling (playing Two-up) and drinking after a spell in gaol following a raid on a two up game. He falls in love with Doreen (Lyell), who works in a pickle factory, but faces competition from a more sophisticated rival, Stror 'at Coot. Bill and Doreen argue, but are eventually reunited and get married. Bill gives up drinking and hanging out with his mate, Ginger Mick, and becomes a family man. He gets an offer from his uncle to manage an orchard in the country, and he and Doreen settle down there with their baby.

J. Dennis as himself Production Tauchert, Emery and Lyell during the filming of The Sentimental Bloke C. J. Dennis' original book had been a best seller since its publication in 1915. It was read by executive J. D. Williams who gave Raymond Longford a copy and suggested it might make a good movie. Longford gave it to his partner Lottie Lyell and she was supportive. Finance was provided by an Adelaide company, the Southern Cross Feature Film Company who had funded The Woman Suffers. C. J. Dennis was reluctant to give away the movie rights for fear it would affect book sales, however he eventually agreed after prolonged negotiations and a royalty payment of ¬£1,000, half the film's budget.Graham Shirley and Brian¬£ Adams, Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years, Currency Press 1989 p 54 Lyell is thought to have co-authored the screenplay which relocated the story from Melbourne to Woolloomooloo in Sydney. Arthur Tauchert had extensive experience working in suburban vaudeville but had only made two short movies prior to this. The movie was shot in 1918 on location in Woolloomooloo, with the orchard scenes done at Hornsby Valley near Sydney, and interiors at open-air sets at Wonderland City, Bondi (which meant Longford could avoid paying excessive rental for using sets at the Rushcutters Bay Studio). Some shots of sunsets and sunrises for the inter titles were done in Adelaide.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 90. Sydney authorities refused to allow police uniforms to be depicted, or for shooting to take place in the city's gaols. However Longford managed to persuade Commonwealth dockside officials to appear as policemen and let him use an old watch house in Woolloomooloo. Reception The movie was first screened privately at Adelaide Wondergraph on 26 November 1918. It took a while for the film to be released as Australasian Films refused to screen the movie in the Union Theatre chain. However it was seen by E. J. Carroll who decided to distribute it in Australia and overseas. The Sentimental Bloke uses intertitles taken from the original poem written in Australian slang and was a hit when it opened in Melbourne Town Hall on 4 October 1919, breaking all existing box office records. It was also popular in Britain and New Zealand, but did not succeed in the U.S., where test audiences failed to understand the language. Despite being recut with Americanised intertitles, having some scenes cut out, and being renamed for the American market as The Story of a Tough Guy, it was withdrawn from distribution.Ina Bertrand, 'Raymond Longford's The Sentimental Bloke: The Restored Version.', Screening the Past, October 2009 accessed 24 July 2012 The initial success of The Sentimental Bloke prompted a sequel in 1920, Ginger Mick, and a remake in 1932 using the latest sound recording equipment from the United States. The sequel was a hit but the remake, although directed by the prolific actor and partner of Hoyts, F. W. Thring, did not fare as well as the original. E. J. Carroll also sponsored a stage version of the book in 1922 produced by Bert Bailey and starring Walter Cornoch as the Bloke and Tal Ordell as Ginger Mick. In 1931 Raymond Longford claimed that the film had been made for ¬£900 and grossed ¬£50,000 around the world. Rediscovery Scenes from The Sentimental Bloke A 1952 fire in a Melbourne film library destroyed all but two boxes of film archives. The boxes revealed a complete 35mm nitrate positive of The Sentimental Bloke, which the following year were sent to a Sydney laboratory for duplication on to new 16mm acetate stock. The original nitrate copies were believed to have been destroyed in the 1960s. The new print was screened at the 1955 Sydney Film Festival to great acclaim, although Longford was not invited, as the organisers did not realise he was still alive.Graham Shirley, Restoring and re-releasing 'The Sentimental Bloke', National Film and Sound Archive, 12 May 2009 accessed 24 July 2012 The film also screened at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. An original 35mm negative of the film was discovered in 1973 at the Film Archive at George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester, New York. The canisters had been mislabelled as The Sentimental Blonde but were discovered by luck. The film was the U.S. version which had some scenes deleted and included intertitles for the American audience. It was however, a better quality print than any of the Australian copies, and provided a base for a complete restoration. The National Film and Sound Archive commenced on a full restoration project for the film in 2000 using the various pieces of archive material available. The project included colour tinting as close as possible to the original. This 'new' version premiered at the 2004 Sydney Film Festival and has played at the 2005 London Film Festival. It has since been released as a two DVD set which includes a booklet describing the film's history.Warren Brown, 'The Sentimental Bloke', Rewind, 5 September 2004 accessed 24 July 2012 See also * Cinema of Australia * List of films based on poems * Albert Arlen ‚Äì composer of The Sentimental Bloke musical References External links Raymond Longford & Lottie Lyell by William M.

The term \\"racing stripe\\" is also used to refer to diagonal lines painted on watercraft hulls, usually on vessels belonging to a country's coast guard.  Racing cars  Cunningham C-4R Racing stripes were applied to the Cunningham team's racecars beginning in 1951. Usually two parallel blue stripes running from front to rear in the centre of the white body, they helped spectators identify the cars during races. These evolved from the traditional FIA-registered American racing colours of a white body and blue chassis, which dated from when racing cars had the chassis exposed. The two blue stripes were a symbolic echo of the chassis colours.The Le Mans Era: 1950 ‚Äì 1955 In 1964, the Shelby Daytona Coupe would use the converse blue with white stripes and would compete in the 1964 and 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Road cars and \\"go-faster stripes\\"  The first road car to implement racing stripes was the 1965 Ford Mustang GT350. From the 1960s, stripes have sometimes been applied to road cars as well as racing cars. Such cars as the Renault 8 Gordini had stripes fitted as standard. They are sometimes referred to as \\"go-faster stripes\\" on road cars. An alternative style features stripes which wrap around the car sideways instead of running down the center of the vehicle, called \\"bumblebee stripes\\". These stripes were featured prominently on the Dodge Charger Daytona racecar. Dodge's \\"Scat Pack\\" performance package for 1968-1971 muscle cars featured the bumblebee stripe as a signature. In 1996, a pair of 8-inch wide stripes were used on the Dodge Viper GTS, starting a revival of the fashion.Fast Car magazine, June 1998 Since then, they have often been referred to as \\"Viper Stripes\\".

Plot A scientist from the country of New Swissland (a country that doesn't exist, with a foreign culture where everyone has a silly name) called Professor Pippy P. Poopypants goes to the United States to demonstrate how his striking Shrinky-Pig and Goosy-Grow can help the world by reducing the garbage and increasing food, but everyone laughs at Poopypants' name rather than take him seriously. Meanwhile, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School is going to a restaurant-arcade called The Piqua Pizza Palace, but when George and Harold rearrange the sign, Mr. Krupp catches the boys as he bans them from the school field trip and demands they clean the teachers' lounge, making them lose their chance of going to the Piqua Pizza Palace with everyone else. However, the boys get their revenge by modifying things around in the teachers' lounge and after the field trip, the teachers fall into George and Harold's trap and get largely covered in glue and foam pellets. They chase the boys around the school and after seeing the teachers looking like abominable snowmen, Mr. Fyde quits, thinking he's going nuts, prompting Mr. Krupp to find a new science teacher. Meanwhile, Professor Poopypants sees an ad to teach at the school and applies for the job, thinking children to be kind and sweet-hearted, but they spend days laughing at his silly name. The professor only gets them interested by building a robot that makes gerbils jog along with them but it is short- lived. Some time later, Ms. Ribble reads The Pied Piper of Hamelin, which inspires George and Harold to make a comic about the Professor trying to take over the world, which destroys the last of Professor Poopypants' sanity. He makes the gerbil machine as large as a tall building, then shrinks the school and holds them hostage to turn their names sillier, with a system of three alphabetical name charts based on the first/last letter of each part of a first and last name. George and Harold (now Fluffy and Cheeseball) get Captain Underpants (now Buttercup Chickenfanny, but refuses to take the professor's order to change names) to steal Professor Poopypants' enlarging machine, but he and the machine are shrunk in the process. The two of them try to enlarge the school back to normal size, but get flicked off the school. Harold makes a paper airplane that George enlarges and after many dangers, Underpants rescues them. George enlarges Underpants to the gerbil's size, then he defeats Professor Poopypants and everyone's names revert. The boys use the machines to bring themselves, the school and Captain Underpants back to normal size. Captain Underpants is soaked with water, turning him back into Mr. Krupp. Professor Poopypants is hauled off to jail for crimes against humanity. From the advice of George and Harold, he legally changes his name so that no one will make fun of it anymore. Unfortunately, he changes his name to his grandfather's, Tippy Tinkletrousers, that which only makes the prisoners (and police officers) laugh at him even more, much to his anger.

Following book The book that followed this was The Wicked Wedgie Woman (2001). Reception The Book received mainly positive reviews from critics. The main antagonist of the book, Professor Poopypants, would return in later books of the series as both a recurring character and even the main villain. He would also return in Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. The book was removed from an elementary school in Page, North Dakota due to parental complaints.

It was published on August 29, 2001. It features the reformation of George and Harold's formerly cruel teacher, Ms. Ribble, at the end using the 3-D Hypno Ring (which is used to hypnotize Mr. Krupp, causing him to become Captain Underpants in the first book) through reverse psychology, because the ring causes females to do the opposite of what the bearers of the ring force them to do. Plot Ms. Ribble announces that she is going to retire at the end of the school year and forces everyone to make happy retirement cards for her, while George and Harold make a Captain Underpants comic with her as \\" The Wicked Wedgie Woman\\" instead, and the boys pass out the \\"Friday Memo\\", with several humorous changes. They later convince Mr. Krupp to sign a blank card, but later, having found out about their comic, he puts them in detention. Harold defiantly refuses to give Ms. Ribble the card, while Mr. Krupp seizes it; Harold makes it look like a marriage proposal. Mr. Krupp remains indifferent to the following chaotic school week. (The week involves none of the kids showing up on Monday, all the kids wearing their pajamas to school and picking their noses on Tuesday, some of the kids looking very silly on Wednesday, kids having food fights in the lunchroom and the football team wrecking the teachers' lounge on Thursday and every single kid wearing bee costumes to school and making silly faces in yearbook photos on Friday.) At the wedding, just before they get married, Ms. Ribble breaks up with Mr. Krupp because he has a funny-looking nose (ironically, they both have the same nose shape). When they say it was George and Harold, the boys escape. Ms. Ribble has dropped their B's and C's to F's and G's (which is the only grade lower than an F), which means that they'll have to redo the fourth grade. Harold reluctantly agrees to hypnotize her, then a local newscast reveals the police are shutting down the Hypno-Ring company because when the Hypno-Rings are used on women, a mental blunder causes them do the opposite of what the bearer of the Hypno-Ring tells them to do. The boys, as an afterthought, tell Ms. Ribble that she will be the nicest teacher ever and will not become mean like The Wicked Wedgie Woman. That night, Ms. Ribble arrives as The Wicked Wedgie Woman, but accidentally spills super power juice into her hair, which forms several tiny hands. She kidnaps the boys and takes them to her house, where she builds robot copies of them. When Mr. Krupp snaps at Harold 2000, he turns himself into Captain Underpants and asks for help from the robots, whose Spray Starch defeats him. Meanwhile, The Wicked Wedgie Woman ties the boys to adjacent chairs with a candle and hatchet, but instead of hurting George and Harold, the hatchet simply cuts through the ropes. George and Harold find the wedgied Captain Underpants, convinced that he lost his powers. The newest store sells everything but fabric softener, so they make a comic about Captain Underpants' origin. He reads it, eventually says the words on the back and defeats the robots. As Captain Underpants and The Wicked Wedgie Woman face off, George shouts to Harold that he'll get rid of his extra-strength starch, and she steals all the bottles and sprays them at Captain Underpants. Due to the counterfeited hair remover, everyone is bald (even Captain Underpants). Captain Underpants turns back into Mr. Krupp and the boys hypnotize Ms. Ribble to forget the last two weeks and become the nicest teacher in the school's history, much to the kids' happiness. =Comics= Comic 1: Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman Ms. Ribble gives the students each 41 book reports as holiday homework. After the holiday, the book reports fall on top of her, nearly killing her. She is transported to a hospital, where they rebuild her into a robot with a wedgie robo-claw inside. Captain Underpants appears, but loses against The Wicked Wedgie Woman because she arms herself with spray starch, then hangs him on a pole. Some children walk by and catapult him into a pool, pouring fabric softener in it. Underpants creates a loop underneath The Wicked Wedgie Woman, which the robo-claw follows her instead of Underpants, then he takes her to jail. Comic 2: The Origin of Captain Underpants The second comic in the book starts with an introduction to Underpantyworld, Captain Underpants' fictional home world. Suddenly, the Wedgie Warlords aboard the Starch Ship Enterprize appear and spray starch on Underpantyworld. However, the leader, \\"Big Daddy Long Johns\\", creates an amulet that is able to protect the entire planet from the starch. However, it gets accidentally swallowed by his son, \\"Little Baby Underpants\\" (later revealed to be Captain Underpants), so the entire planet becomes doomed. Big Daddy Long Johns and his wife, \\"Princess Pantyhose\\", are forced to save their son, and not the planet. Stretching the underwear, Big Daddy Long Johns and Princess Pantyhose catapult Little Baby Underpants towards Earth, while Underpantyworld is destroyed. Little Baby Underpants is adopted by two old people, who name him \\"Captain\\", after their favorite cereal. As he grows up, Captain feels isolated from other children, since he only wears underwear. Captain has a dream, where he meets his parents, and because he has the amulet still inside, he is invulnerable to starch. All he has to do is shout the sentence \\"I summon the power of Underpantyworld\\", and he will overcome the powers of starch. He becomes a superhero named Captain Underpants, and never becomes afraid of starch anymore. The comic ends and in the real world, Captain Underpants shouts out the sentence.

Alexander Jr. (5 August 1971 ‚Äì 22 October 2005) was the 2,000th American soldier killed in combat in Iraq since the beginning of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, according to the Associated Press. He was serving as a crewman on a M2 Bradley combat vehicle when he was mortally wounded. Alexander, an African-American, died 22 October 2005 at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas after being treated for injuries sustained five days earlier, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his M2 Bradley in the city of Samarra. A 1989 graduate of Chilton County High School, Alexander spent two years working as a construction labourer before joining the military as Desert Storm began. At the time of his death, he was serving his third tour of duty in Iraq, assigned to the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, of Fort Benning, Georgia. He is survived by his wife Fina, and two children Jsai and Alexandria. His body was buried at the Agee Memorial Garden in Clanton, Alabama. Media Attention The United States media noted this death above many others, as it was the 2,000th since the start of active combat, a number generally recognized as significant. Articles ran on such sites as CNN.com featuring the soldier. In contrast, the Pentagon downplayed the death ‚Äî Lt. Col. Steven Boylan, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq, told the Associated Press that \\"the 2,000 service members killed in Iraq supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom is not a milestone, it is an artificial mark on the wall set by individuals or groups with specific agendas and ulterior motives.\\" Alexander's death sparked Senators and Congressmen to debate the merits of the war again, something that had not been done in months, with Senators such as Dick Durbin making statements on the war. Peace activists cast the 2,000th combat death as a milestone in what they believe to be an unnecessary and unwinnable war. Immediately following the report of his death, six hundred anti-war protests and candlelight vigils were held in the United States on 26 October 2005.

History Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi were connected with the first known expedition in search of an ocean way from Europe to India (Cape Route). Ugolino, with his brother Guido or Vandino Vivaldo, was in command of this expedition of two galleys, which he had organized in conjunction with Tedisio Doria, and which left Genoa in May 1291 with the purpose of going to India \\"by the Ocean Sea\\" and bringing back useful things for trade. Planned primarily for commerce, the enterprise also aimed at proselytism. Two Franciscan friars accompanied Ugolino. The galleys were well armed and sailed down the Morocco coast to a place called Gozora (Cape Nun), in 28¬∫ 47' N., after which nothing more was heard of them. The expedition of the Vivaldi brothers was one of the first recorded voyages that sailed out from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic since the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. It is believed that when Lancelotto Malocello set sail from Genoa in 1312, he did so in order to search for Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi. Malocello ended up remaining on the island that is named for him, Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands, for more than two decades. Early in the next (14th) century, Sorleone de Vivaldo, son of Ugolino, undertook a series of distant wanderings in search of his father and uncle, and even penetrated, it is said, to Mogadishu on the Somali coast. In 1455 another Genoese seaman, Antoniotto Uso di Mare, sailing with Cadamosto in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, claimed to have met, near the mouth of the Gambia, with the last descendant of the survivors of the Vivaldo expedition. The two galleys, he was told, had sailed to the Sea of Guinea; in that sea one was stranded, but the other passed on to a place on the coast of Aethiopia (here meaning Black Africa) ‚Äî Mena or Amenuan, near the Gihon (here probably meaning the Senegal River) where the Genoese were seized and held in close captivity.  Sources  The principal documentary source is the Genoese annals of Jacopo Doria, presented to the city of Genoa in 1294. Under the entry of the year 1291, Doria writes the following: Additional documents identify the other brother as \\"Vadino\\", that Tedesio Doria (Jacopo's nephew) did not embark, that the supplies were for \\"ten years\\", that the names of the vessels were Sanctus Antonius and Alegranzia, and that the ship made a brief stop at Majorca before proceeding.Rogers (1955: p.37)  Geography  Jean Gimpel suggests that the two Franciscan friars who accompanied the Vivaldi brothers may have read the Opus Majus written by their fellow Franciscan, Roger Bacon, in which Bacon suggested that the distance separating Spain and India was not great, a theory that was later repeated by Pierre d'Ailly and tested by Christopher Columbus. It is uncertain how far the Vivaldi brothers reached. The Vivaldi brothers may have seen or landed on the Canary Islands. \\"Gozora\\" is a name found in some Medieval charts for Cape Non, which lies before the Canary Islands (e.g. Caput Finis Gozole in the maps of Giovanni da Carignano (early 1300s) and the Pizzigani brothers (1367)). The name of the ship Alegranzia may be the source for the Canary Island of Alegranza, and has led to the supposition that the brothers landed there (or that at least one of the ships capsized there). An allusion to the Vivaldi galleys is given in the Libro del Conoscimiento, a semi-fantastical travelogue written by an anonymous Spanish friar in c.1350-1385. There are two passages relating to the Vivaldi brothers. In the first, the narrator, traveling in what seems like the Guinea region (sub- Saharan Africa) reaches the city of Gra√ßiona, capital of the black African empire of Abdeselib, which is allied to Prester John. \\"They told me in this city of Graciona that the Genoese who escaped the galley that was wrecked at Amenuan were brought (betrayed?) here, but it was never known what became of the other galley which escaped.\\".Libro del Conoscimiento,1877 edition, p.63 When the traveling friar moves on to the neighboring city of Magdasor, he came across a Genoese man named Sor Leone who was in this city \\"searching for his father who had left in two galleys, as I have already explained, and they gave him every honor, but when this Sor Leone wanted to traverse to the empire of Graciona to search for his father, the emperor of Magdasor did not allow it, because way was doubtful and the path was dangerous\\"Libro del Conoscimiento,1877 edition, p.67. As it happens, Sorleone is the real name of Ugolino's actual son.Rogers, p.43 The location of these kingdoms have been much speculated. The references to Prester John and Magdasor (which sounds much like Mogadishu in Somalia) has led assume that it says the other galley circumnavigated Africa but was intercepted around the Horn of Africa. But the narrator's geographical references (e.g. to the Senegal-Niger River, the gold trade, the Mali Empire, even the Gulf of Guinea, suggests Abdelsalib and Magdasor are in non-Muslim sub-Saharan west Africa. The localization of \\"Amenuan\\", the place where the first galley capsized, is suggestive of Senegambia region. If there is a grain of truth in any of this, it would not stretch credulity to imagine that the Vivaldis got as far as Senegal, and that their adventures ended there. A century later, in late 1455, Antoniotto Usodimare, a Genoese navigator in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, claims rather improbably in a letter that while traveling up the Gambia River in West Africa, he came across a man who spoke the Genoese dialect and claimed to be the last descendant of the survivors of the Vivaldi expedition.For a copy of Usodimare's letter, see R.H. Major (1868) Life of Prince Henry of Portugal, p.104 (Usodimare's travelling companion, Alvise Cadamosto, mentions no such meeting in his memoirs.) Usodimare gives more details of the Vivaldi expedition in another document in the Genoese archives: Gion is the name of Biblical Gihon river that stems from the Garden of Eden and flows through Ethiopia. In this instance, it may be a reference to the Senegal River.Usodimare's travelling companion Alvise Cadamosto in his Navigazione (1460s: p.111) makes the independent note that the Senegal River was sourced from the Biblical Gihon. Usodimare's narration seems to be a mere repetition of the tale told in the Libro del Conoscimiento. The historian Jos√© de Viera y Clavijo writes that Father Agust√≠n Justiniani, in the Anales de G√©nova, includes the information that two Franciscans also joined the Vivaldi expedition. Viera y Clavijo also mentions the fact that Petrarch states that it was a local tradition that the Vivaldis did indeed reach the Canary Islands. Neither Justiniani nor Petrarch knew of the expedition's fate. Papiro Masson in his Anales writes that the brothers were the first modern discoverers of the Canary Islands. The Vivaldi brothers subsequently became the subjects of legends that featured them circumnavigating Africa before being captured by the mythical Christian king Prester John.Ugolino and Vadino Vivaldi Biography The Vivaldis' voyage may have inspired Dante‚Äôs Canto 26 of the Inferno about Ulysses‚Äô last voyage, which ends in failure in the Southern Hemisphere.Peter d‚ÄôEpiro; Mary Desmond Pinkowish; Sprezzatura: 50 Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World (Anchor, 2001), 105. According to Henry F. Cary, Ulysses' fate was inspired \\"...partly from the fate which there was reason to suppose had befallen some adventurous explorers of the Atlantic ocean.\\"Cary's notes in The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri (Harvard Classics) New York, 1909: vol. i:112.

The first part was published on August 1, 2003, and the second part was published on September 30, 2003. The books features the debut of George and Harold's new pets Sulu (a hamster with a bionic endoskeleton) and Crackers (a Quetzalcoatlus) who first appeared in the first and second parts respectively. The second part also features the debut of time travel in the series, which would become a core theme of the series later on. The full color covers are for Part 1's color called Purple and Blue. but Part 2's color is called, Purple and White. Plot summary =Part 1: The Night of the Nasty Nostril Nuggets= At demonstration speech day, George and Harold show off the \\"Squishy\\"; two ketchup packets under a toilet seat. But Melvin forces everyone to watch his demonstration, the \\"Combine-o-Tron 2000\\", which he uses his hamster Sulu and a robotic hamster body he built to show off. Melvin orders Sulu to do some tricks for the class, but the hamster's able to spank Melvin himself. After noticing the scene, George and Harold adopt Sulu, who happily joins the two. Meanwhile, Ms. Ribble uses a Squishy on an already grumpy Mr. Krupp, who believes that George and Harold are responsible. When Mr. Krupp finds them in the lunchroom, Melvin almost immediately tattles on the boys and Mr. Krupp sends them to detention, causing them to make a libelous Captain Underpants comic starring Melvin. Having read the comic, Melvin angrily goes home and builds a super-powered robot to combine himself with using the Combine-O-Tron. However, Melvin sneezes at the last second from his allergy to cats and gets combined with the robot and boogers, turning him into the Bionic Booger Boy. Eventually, he even acquires his own drinking fountain. The cold and flu season begins, however and when the class visits a tissue factory, owner Snoddy offers free tissues, but Melvin becomes gigantic as a natural defense. George turns Mr. Krupp into Captain Underpants and the man saves his secretary, Miss Edith Anthrope. Her wet kisses turn him back and Melvin devours him, but Sulu defeats Melvin using large novelty items from warehouses. George's suggestion, reversing the batteries in the Combine-o- Tron, surprisingly works, and only three robotic booger globs fly off. However, Mr. Krupp and Melvin's brains have accidentally switched bodies. While Melvin/Mr. Krupp boasts about the Combine-O-Tron saving the day, Mr. Krupp/Melvin tries to get the boys in jail. Suddenly, the globs come to life and smash the Combine-O-Tron. =Part 2: The Revenge of the Ridiculous Robo- Boogers= The globs start chasing George, Harold, Sulu, Melvin and Mr Krupp. They reach a dead end, but where Sulu spits them out into outer space. After a number of incidents, George and Harold discover the body mix-up. Since it would take Melvin six months to build another machine, George suggests going back in time, which makes Melvin snap his fingers, causing Mr. Krupp to turn into Captain Underpants and fly away. George and Harold are forced to tell the secret and Melvin orders them to create a comic about him, before setting to build. The next day, Melvin is furious that the former mentioned depicts him as uncool, but soon explains to them that if the machine's used two days in a row, something will place the world in a catastrophe. He also gives them the \\"Forgetchamacallit 2000\\", against one's short-term memory. George and Harold decide two days back to get to Melvin's \\"Combine-O-Tron 2000. However, the boys end up in the Cretaceous period and get a female Quetzalcoatlus, who they nickname \\"Crackers\\". The two go to when Singerbrains is driving to the police station. George convinces her she is dreaming because of \\"the dinosaur's presence\\", etc. Harold sends Crackers back, then they erase her memory, get the Combine-O-Tron and travel to the present. Meanwhile, Captain is helping two old ladies cross the street. He successfully rescues a cat from a tree at the same time, but accidentally leaves the ladies up there. They, and other victims of him, including Anthrope, form an angry mob. Melvin\\" finds Underpants and switches one another back. In space, the boogers land on a spaceship, hanging on as it returns to Earth, before they start destroying the space center. Underpants goes off to help, but discovers that his powers were taken by \\"Big Melvin\\", who refuses to help unless George and Harold change the comic. Captain Underpants and the boys are cornered at a local store and starts throwing random items stacked outside. By chance, Carl is killed upon swallowing an orange. The other boogers become cautious, but Captain Underpants makes a deliberately annoying \\"Underpants Dance\\", making them climb up his chosen building, right into a well-placed orange-made Squishy. Soon, \\"Big Melvin\\" lies to the Eyewitness News crew (including spanking Captain Underpants) while George and Harold sneak back to school, returning with the machines. Captain Underpants gets his powers back, then the crew and audience's memories are erased. The angry mob find Melvin (who no longer has superpowers) and chase him in retribution. When the boys return to their clubhouse, George finds out that Harold didn't really send Crackers back. Harold is keeping Crackers as another pet, which George decides she could stay in the present for just one night. But the next day, when George, Harold and Sulu are ready to take Crackers back where she belongs, the time machine malfunctions. =Comics= Captain Underpants and the Terrifying Tale of the Tattle-Tron 2000 (From Part 1) Melvin is a huge snitch who tattles on everything.

Over the days people make him the protecter of the town. The jails fill up so quickly that he is forced to create a giant robot one. Underpants easily escapes out of the robot jail. He does not want to hurt the people inside, but pours a giant bottle of \\"Mrs. Plop's Prune Juice\\" into the robot jail's mouth, making it shoot out the prisoners.

He was a son of John II of Simmern and inherited the Palatinate from the childless Elector Otto-Henry, Elector Palatine (Ottheinrich) in 1559. He was a devout convert to Calvinism, and made the Reformed confession the official religion of his domain by overseeing the composition and promulgation of the Heidelberg Catechism. His support of Calvinism gave the German Reformed movement a foothold within the Holy Roman Empire. Life Frederick III and his wives, Marie of Brandenburg and Amalia of Neuenahr Frederick was strictly educated in the Roman faith at his father's court and at Cologne, but, influenced by his wife, the pious princess Maria of Brandenburg, whom he married in 1537, he followed the Reformation, and in 1546 made a public profession of his faith. He succeeded his father John II as duke of Simmern on 18 May 1557, and became elector on 12 February 1559, on the death of Otto Henry. Under his predecessor strict Lutherans like Tilemann Heshusius, Melanchthonians, and Calvinists had found a place in the Palatinate. In the summer of 1559 bitter controversies arose among them. Theses on the Lord's Supper prepared by the Heidelberg deacon Wilhelm Klebitz provoked a bitter controversy between him and Heshusius. When efforts at mediation failed Frederick deposed both men on 16 September 1559. To get a clear understanding of the controversy Frederick spent days and nights in theological studies and was thus led more and more to the Reformed confession. A disputation held in June 1560 between the Saxon theologians Johann St√∂ssel and Joachim M√∂rlin and the Heidelbergers Pierre Boquin, Thomas Erastus, and Paul Einhorn increased Frederick's dislike for the Lutheran zealots. After the Naumburg Convention (January, 1561) Frederick fully adopted the Reformed dogmas. In March 1561 he invited Emmanuel Tremellius to Heidelberg, and in September the famous Zacharius Ursinus. The whole Church was now transformed. Caspar Olevianus had been there since January 1560. Images of the saints, vestments, baptismal fonts, and other \\"idolatrous works,\\" even organs, were ruthlessly removed from the churches. In the celebration of the Lord's Supper the breaking of bread was introduced. The revenues from monasteries and foundations were confiscated and applied to Evangelical church purposes or charity. The Heidelberg Catechism, prepared by a committee of theologians and ministers likely led by Ursinus, now served as the norm of doctrine and for the instruction of the youth. The church order of 15 November 1563 and the consistory order of 1564 consolidated the changes. The opposition of ministers inclining to Lutheranism was suppressed by their dismissal. Among the Lutherans, Frederick's measures caused a great sensation. The religious colloquy held at Maulbronn in April 1564 increased the animosity. In 1565 the Emperor Maximilian ordered the changes to be annulled. A unanimous decree of the 1566 Diet of Augsburg also demanded the abolition of the changes. Frederick, however, declared in the 14 May session of the Diet that a matter was concerned over which God alone has the rule, and if it was intended to proceed against him, he would find comfort in the promises of his Saviour. The decree was not carried out. After completing the work of reform in the Rhine Palatinate, Frederick endeavored to continue it in the Upper Palatinate; but here he was resisted by the zealous Lutheran estates. He continued his work of reform on the Rhine by introducing in 1570 a strict church discipline. Frederick pronounced the sentence of death on the Antitrinitarian Johann Sylvan based on the opinion signed by Olevianus, Ursinus, and Boquin, on 23 December 1572. In 1562 Frederick gave Frankenthal as a refuge to the Evangelicals driven from the Netherlands. He sent his like-minded son Johann Casimir in 1567 and again in 1576 to France in aid of the Huguenots. In 1569 he assisted also the Count Palatine Wolfgang of Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken on his way to France. Frederick's last years were troubled by domestic afflictions. As his older son Louis was a strict Lutheran, he could not hope that after his death his work would be carried out in his own spirit. Family and children Frederick III was married twice. Firstly, he married in 1537 Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1519 - 1567), daughter of Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth and Susanna of Bavaria. Their children were: # Alberta (4 April 1538 - 19 March 1553) # Louis VI, Elector Palatine (4 July 1539 - 22 October 1583) # Elisabeth (30 June 1540 - 8 February 1594), married in 1558 to Duke Johann Frederick II of Saxony # Hermann Ludwig (6 October 1541 - 1 July 1556) # Johann Casimir (7 March 1543 - 16 January 1592); married: 1570 Elisabeth of Saxony (18 October 1552 - 2 April 1590) # Dorothea Susanne (15 November 1544 - 8 April 1592), married in 1560 to John William, Duke of Saxe- Weimar # Albert (30 September 1546 - 30 April 1547) # Anna Elisabeth (23 July 1549 - 20 September 1609), married: ## in 1569 to Landgrave Philipp II of Hesse-Rheinfels; ## in 1599 to Count Palatine John August of Veldenz # Christof (13 June 1551 - 14 April 1574) # Karl (28 December 1552 - 12 September 1555) # Kunigunde Jakob√§a (9 October 1556 - 26 January 1586), married in 1580 to Count John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg Secondly, he married in 1569 Amalia of Neuenahr ( 1539 - 1602), but this marriage was childless. He died in 1576, and was succeeded as Elector Palatine by his son Louis VI. Frederick had carved out a territory from the Lower Palatine land dubbed \\"Pfalz-Lautern\\" for his second surviving son Johann Casimir as an enclave to enable the continued existence of the Reformed faith. Johann Casimir would serve as regent for the Electorate of the Palatinate upon Louis VI's death and would oversee the return of the Reformed faith to the Palatinate.

He has green fur and yellow stripes in a tiger-like pattern, and is Prince Adam's cowardly pet and companion. Upon Prince Adam transforming into He-Man, his Power Sword transforms Cringer into the ferociously brave and superheroic Battle Cat, who serves primarily as He-Man's fighting mount. He- Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983-1985) Battle Cat is the alter ego of Cringer, the cowardly, lazy, over-eating feline companion of Prince Adam. He tends to spend most of his time as Cringer, sleeping, eating, and avoiding responsibility, as well as hiding at the slightest sign of trouble or danger. He can talk, although no reason is ever given for this ability. He has the appearance of a green, orange-striped tiger. In the episode \\"Teela's Quest\\", Queen Marlena says to Adam in regards to the planet Earth, \\"There are no talking green tigers on Earth.\\" It is not known if her referring to Cringer as a tiger means he is called a tiger on Eternia, or if she is simply using it as a comparison, but in the episode \\"A Beastly Sideshow\\", Evil-Lyn also refers to Cringer as a tiger, and in the episode \\"House of Shokoti\\", a boy is surprised that he is \\"a talking tiger\\". It is unclear how many others are like him. When Prince Adam transforms into He-Man, he holds out is sword, which fires an energy beam at Cringer, transforming him into Battle Cat. When Cringer becomes Battle Cat, he grows to about twice his size and is outfitted in red armor that covers his head and back, with a saddle mounted on it for riding. As Battle Cat, he is fearless and powerful. His voice changes significantly and he talks with a growl, as opposed to his whimpering voice that is heard when he is Cringer. Cringer cannot stand becoming Battle Cat, but he goes along with it out of loyalty to Adam. He largely serves as a mount for He-Man, but is known for fighting with villains as well. Battle Cat also has a love interest in the episode \\"The Cat And The Spider\\": Kittrina, a warrior of the cat-people. Cringer as an abandoned kitten in the episode \\"Battle Cat\\", which narrated his back story and how he was eventually adopted by Prince Adam. The story of Cringer/Battle Cat's past is covered in the episode \\"Battle Cat\\". The episode recounts that Adam, while on a few days exploring the jungle as a boy, heard a kitten whining in a bush and a sabrecat approaching. Concerned that the sabrecat might attack the smaller cat, Adam was able to scare the sabrecat away by using a manticore call and headed to the bush where he discovered a small green tiger cub who had been abandoned. Adam took the kitten back to the palace where it was tended to by Man-At-Arms. After it became well, Adam adopted the kitten as his pet. However the kitten was scared easily, and he and Adam were often teased by Teela and the other children in Eternia, who took to calling him a \\"cringer\\" because of his fear causing him to cringe at everything he saw. Although Adam defended his pet, he agreed with calling him Cringer because it was appropriate for the little cat as he was afraid of his own shadow. The Sorceress appeared and told Adam that Cringer might bring him embarrassment now, but in the future he would be useful. Years passed, and after Adam was given the ability to become He-Man, he usually performed the transformation out of sight of Cringer who, even though he had grown to normal tiger size, was still afraid of just about everything. This all changed at an archaeological dig that Adam and Teela went on with Man-At-Arms, with Cringer in tow because he did not want to leave Adam's side. They inadvertently broke open a door releasing a monster, and to attempt to stop the monster Adam transformed into He-Man. Unbeknownst to him, Cringer was watching the entire transformation and ran away to hide. A now-transformed He-Man tried to reassure Cringer that he was still the same person, just with superpowers. However, as he was doing so he accidentally pointed the sword at Cringer, who cowered in fear as Adam's sword was still energized. A beam shot from the sword and struck Cringer, who suddenly grew to twice his size and gained red body armor and a vicious growling voice. He-Man was surprised to see the change in the usually timid cat, but remembered the Sorceress' words from when he was a child; he then received another message, telling him Battle Cat was now his partner. Using Battle Cat, he was able to confine the beast and save the endangered team. This version of Battle Cat can be seen with He-Man in a MetLife commercial that aired in 2012. Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen (2002) Cringer (left) and Battle Cat (right) in the 2002 remake of the series. Cringer is somewhat of a pet to Adam. Although it seems clear that he can understand what is said to him, he cannot speak and sounds like a typical house cat. He is cowardly, although this does not come up as much as in the original series, but more than once he has shown some bravery in order to help Adam. As Battle Cat, he is most often seen merely transporting He-Man and roaring loudly. However, while in the first season he only has a few moments where he fights, in season 2 the writers gave him a more active role; he often fights against the Snake Men and Skeletor's forces. Since he never speaks, there seems to be an effort to portray his relationship with Adam/He- Man as more than master/pet, most often through either Battle Cat or Cringer being badly injured and He-Man entering a rage, or by He-Man explaining things to him. He is twice seen without his battle helmet, revealing a rather fiercer, sabertoothed version of Cringer's face beneath. In the episode \\"The Power of Grayskull\\", King Greyskull was shown to have his own mount, albeit more lion-like and with a mane, who stayed by his side until his death. Origin In The Toys That Made Us, then-marketing VP of Mattel Paul Cleveland recounts the story that while the decision was made for He-Man to have some sort of vehicle, they no longer had the budget to be able to produce one; the decision was then made to repurpose a tiger from the Big Jim toy line. The tiger was, however, not the same scale as the He-Man figure, and compared to He-Man, was about the size of a horse. Cleveland, however, insisted it to be used, even after artist Tony Guerrero made a green version in an attempt to discourage Cleveland, who instead suggested simply putting a saddle on it, which resulted in Battle Cat's final design.The Toys That Made Us; Episode 3 You can see a clip from that episode here. Powers and abilities Cringer is strong enough to carry Adam on his back if Adam is unable to walk on his own or unconscious, and will not hesitate to defend Adam with his life if Adam is in danger. When he transforms into Battle Cat, these qualities are amplified. Sculpture A life-size model of Battle Cat was part of the 2012 Go Safari exhibition, in Northampton, and titled Taxi for Adam (a reference to He-Man's alter ego, Prince Adam). The figure was sculptured by Rory Davis and painted by Ross White. The sculpture was the sixth in the series of \\"Go Safari\\" animals and was initially placed in Wood Hill (near County Hall). Following some naked revelers sitting on the sculpture, and minor vandalism, it was moved to the courtyard of the Northampton Guildhall. The sculpture was removed at the end of the public art project on 2 September 2012.

Gibson. * 335. \\"The Riddle of the Rangoon Ruby\\", published June 1, 1979 in The Shadow Scrapbook anthology * 336. \\"Blackmail Bay\\", published February 1, 1980 in The Duende History of The Shadow Magazine anthology Reprint history The first three Shadow novels were issued in small hardcover versions in 1935 by the Ideal Library. There were three Shadow annuals, in 1942, 1943 and 1947. Each annual would reprint three earlier published novels. (The three novels in each annual were edited to shorter lengths to fit the prescribed size of the publications.) The next reprints of the original pulp stories did not appear until after the original stories ended in 1949: The Weird Adventures of The Shadow was published in 1966 by Grosset and Dunlop. This anthology, however, considerably edited the three stories contained therein. Grosset also published one story, \\"The Grove of Doom\\" as a Tempo paperback 5320, crediting Walter GIbson as author. From 1969 to 1970, Bantam Books published seven reprints of early Shadow stories. The stories contained minor edits. In 1974, Pyramid Books began reprinting early Shadow stories. The series, which consisted of 23 volumes, lasted through 1978. The reprints did not follow the original sequence of the pulp series. In 1975, two Shadow stories were published in a facsimile magazine published by Dover. Eight Shadow stories were reissued in hardcover anthologies by the Doubleday Crime Club in the 1970s. These reprints give sole credit to Walter Gibson as the author, rather than using the Maxwell Grant pseudonym on the cover. In 1984, Mysterious Press published The Shadow and the Golden Master, a hardcover anthology that reprinted \\"The Golden Master\\" and \\"Shiwan Khan Returns\\". Dover Books would later reprint this in paperback. In 2006, Sanctum Books, in association with Nostalgia Ventures, began reprinting the original pulps in near-replica editions. Each issue contains the original interior illustrations from the pulps as well as the original covers on the front and back. In late 2008, Nostalgia Ventures chose to end their association. Sanctum Books continued on their own beginning with book #25. Sanctum Books also released a variant edition of book #9 using an alternate cover. As of January 2020, 151 volumes plus 2 annuals have been published. Each volumes reprints two novels except for volumes 50, 60, 75, 86, 100, 136, 140, 142, 148, and Annual 2 which reprint three novels each. The final three volumes 149, 150, and 151 contain four novels each. Due to an early termination of license Sanctum Books was unable to publish three novels by Bruce Elliott leaving #307 \\"Happy Death Day\\", #311 \\"Death Stalks the U. N.\\" and #319 \\"Murder on Main Street\\" the only Shadow pulp novels that remain unreprinted.

Life Abescat joined the military in October 1912 and spent seven years with an infantry regiment. Immediately following the French declaration of war, his unit was mobilized and sent to the Belgian frontier to await the German advance. During their first engagement his company lost all but 80 soldiers, and most of those were injured. Abescat was slightly injured in that fight. In 1916, he was seriously wounded near Verdun, where fighting cost the lives of 250,000 French and German soldiers. His leg was amputated late in life, in part due to his old war wound. To his dying day, he kept several small shell fragments that had been taken from his leg in 1916. After the war, Abescat joined a state financing agency where he worked until his retirement in 1957. His memory was very clear until the end of his life. As such he was interviewed several times. Segments of his recollections appear in several documentaries. In one he recounts visiting the Exposition Universelle of 1900. Abescat became the oldest living French man upon the death of 110-year-old Alexis Daigneau on 3 April 2001. He died on 25 August 2001, just 16 days before his 110th birthday, and was succeeded as the oldest living French man by 109-year-old Polish-born Joseph Rabenda.

This is in contrast to simultaneous catabolism, where each substrate is catabolized concomitantly by different enzymes. Cometabolism occurs when an enzyme produced by an organism to catalyze the degradation of its growth-substrate to derive energy and carbon from it is also capable of degrading additional compounds. The fortuitous degradation of these additional compounds does not support the growth of the bacteria, and some of these compounds can even be toxic in certain concentrations to the bacteria. The first report of this phenomenon was the degradation of ethane by the species Pseudomonas methanica. These bacteria degrade their growth-substrate methane with the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO). MMO was discovered to be capable of degrading ethane and propane, although the bacteria were unable to use these compounds as energy and carbon sources to grow. Another example is Mycobacterium vaccae, which uses an alkane monooxygenase enzyme to oxidize propane. Accidentally, this enzyme also oxidizes, at no additional cost for M. vaccae, cyclohexane into cyclohexanol. Thus, cyclohexane is co-metabolized in the presence of propane. This allows for the commensal growth of Pseudomonas on cyclohexane. The latter can metabolize cyclohexanol, but not cyclohexane.  Cometabolism in Bioremediation  Some of the molecules that are cometabolically degraded by bacteria are xenobiotic, persistent compounds, such as PCE, TCE, and MTBE, that have harmful effects on several types of environments. Co-metabolism is thus used as an approach to biologically degrade hazardous solvents. Cometabolism can be used for the biodegradation of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE): an aquatic environment pollutant. Some Pseudomonas members were found to be able to fully degrade MTBE cometabolically with the enzymes they produce to oxidize n-alkanes (e.g. methane, propane). Additionally, a promising method of bioremediation of chlorinated solvents involves cometabolism of the contaminants by aerobic microorganisms in groundwater and soils. Several aerobic microorganisms have been demonstrated to be capable of doing this, including n-alkane, aromatic compound (e.g. toluene, phenol) and ammonium oxidizers. One example is Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1, which can degrade a hazardous, and water-soluble compound tetrachloroethylene (PCE). PCE, one of the major underground water contaminants, was regarded as being undegradable under aerobic conditions and only degraded via reductive dehalogenation to be used as a growth-substrate by organisms. Reductive dehalogenation often results in the partial dechlorination of the PCE, giving rise to toxic compounds such as TCE, DCE, and vinyl chloride. Pseudomonas st. OX1 can degrade PCE under aerobic conditions by using toluene-o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO), an enzyme they produce to derive energy and carbon from toluene and several other aromatic compounds. This biological process could be utilized to remove PCE from aerobic polluted sites. However, the difficulties and high costs of maintaining the growth-substrates of the organisms capable of cometabolising these hazardous compounds and providing them an aerobic environment have led to the limited field-scale application of cometabolism for pollutant solvent degradation. Recently, this method of remediation has been proposed to be improved by the substitution of the synthetic aromatic growth-substrates (e.g. toluene) of these bacteria with cheap, non-toxic plant secondary metabolites.

It was built in Jerusalem at the eastern end of the so-called Second Wall, at the north-western corner of the Temple Mount. History Herod (r. 37 ‚Äì c. 4 BCE) built the fortress to protect the Temple. He named it for his patron Mark Antony (83‚Äì30 BCE). The fortress housed some part of the Roman garrison of Jerusalem. The Romans also stored the high priest's vestments within the fortress. The fortress was one of the last strongholds of the Jews in the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), when the Second Temple was destroyed. =Construction date controversy= The construction date is controversial because the name suggests that Herod built Antonia before the defeat of Mark Antony by Octavian in 31-30 BCE and Mark Antony's suicide in 30 BCE. Herod is famous for being an apt diplomat and pragmatist, who always aligned himself with the winning side and the \\"man in charge\\" of Rome. It is somewhat difficult to bring this date in accordance with the presumed date for the construction of the Herodian Temple. Christian tradition Traditionally, Christians have believed for centuries that the vicinity of the Antonia Fortress was the site of Pontius Pilate' praetorium, where Jesus was tried for high treason. This was based on the assumption that an area of Roman flagstones discovered beneath the Church of the Condemnation and the Convent of the Sisters of Zion was 'the pavement' which describes as the location of Jesus' trial. =Antonia pavement: archaeological counter- arguments= Pierre Benoit, former professor of New Testament studies at the √âcole Biblique, reexamined the results of all previous surveys of the north- western escarpment of the Haram, of the archaeological studies of the sites owned by the Catholics in the area (Convent of the Sisters of Zion, Flagellation Monastery and St Anne Convent of the White Fathers), as well as the digs north of the Struthion Pool area, and published in 1971 his conclusions: Archaeological investigation indicates that about a century after the presumed time of Jesus' death, this area was rebuilt as the eastern of two forums belonging to the new city initiated by Hadrian in around 130 CE, the Aelia Capitolina, and it is conceivable that following the destruction of the Antonia Fortress during the siege of 70 CE, its pavement tiles were reused at Hadrian's forum. However, he also considers the possibility that the pavement is from Hadrian's time altogether. The eastern forum of the Aelia Capitolina was built over the Struthion Pool, which was mentioned by first-century historian Josephus as being adjacent to the fortress (Josephus, Jewish War 5:11:4). =Praetorium at royal palace, not at Antonia= There are textual and archaeological arguments against the trial of Jesus being carried out at the Antonia Fortress. Like Philo, Josephus testifies that the Roman governors stayed in Herod's Palace while they were in Jerusalem,Benoit (1976), p. 87 and carried out their trials on the pavement immediately outside it (Josephus, Jewish Wars, 2:14:8). Josephus indicates that Herod's Palace is on the Western Hill (Jewish Wars, 5:2) and in 2001 some of its vestiges were rediscovered under a corner of the Tower of David.Jacqueline Schaalje, \\"Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace\\", The Jewish Magazine (October 2001). Archaeologists therefore conclude that in the first century, the praetorium‚Äîthe residence of the praefectus (governor)‚Äîwas in the former royal palace on the Western Hill, rather than at the Antonia Fortress, on the opposite side of the city. However, as the tradition retained its power in associating the fortress with Jesus' trial, the place where it once stood serves as the starting point of the Via Dolorosa commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus. Description Although modern reconstructions often depict the fortress as having a tower at each of four corners, Josephus repeatedly refers to it as \\"the tower Antonia\\", and states that it had been built by John Hyrcanus and later by King Herod, and used for a vestry, in which were reposited the vestments of the high priest.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 18:4:3; 15.403 Josephus states: > The general appearance of the whole was that of a tower with other towers at > each of the four corners; three of these turrets were fifty cubits high, > while that at the south-east angle rose to seventy cubits and so commanded a > view of the whole area of the temple.Josephus, The Jewish War, Book V, v. > 238, pp. 275 & 277, translated by Henry St. John Thackeray, The Loeb > Classical Library, William Heinemann Ltd (London) and Harvard University > Press, 1961 (reprint of 1928 first edition). Accessed July 2020. Some archaeologists are also of the opinion that the fortress consisted only of a single tower, located at the south-east corner of the site.Benoit (1976), p. 89 For example, Pierre Benoit writes that there is absolutely no archaeological support for there having been four towers. Josephus attests to the importance of the Antonia: \\"For if the Temple lay as a fortress over the city, Antonia dominated the Temple & the occupants of that post were the guards of all three.\\" Josephus placed the Antonia at the northwest corner of the colonnades surrounding the Temple. Modern depictions often show the Antonia as being located along the north side of the Temple enclosure.

Nothing remains of the station; Muswell Hill Primary School occupies its former site. In the 1930s plans were made to electrify the line and transfer the mainline service to London Underground's Northern line, but these were abandoned after the Second World War. The station closed for passengers in 1954 and goods in 1956. History Great Northern Railway's Northern Heights branches, 1900 Muswell Hill Primary School stands on the station's former site The Muswell Hill Railway (MHR) opened the station on 24 May 1873 as Alexandra Park (Muswell Hill). It was the intermediate station on the MHR's branch line from the Great Northern Railway's (GNR's) station at Highgate to Alexandra Palace. The line was constructed to bring passengers to Alexandra Palace and the branch line opened at the same time as the Palace. Following a fire at the Palace, the line was closed from 1 August 1873 to 1 May 1875 with the station being given its final name when reopened. The other intermediate station on the line, , did not open until 1902. In 1911 the line was taken over by the GNR. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies, the line was, from 1923, part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1935 London Transport planned, as part of its \\"Northern Heights plan\\", to take over the line from LNER together with the LNER's routes from Finsbury Park to Edgware and High Barnet. The line was to be modernised to use electric trains and amalgamated with the Northern line. At Finsbury Park the line was to be connected to the Northern line's Northern City branch so that services from Muswell Hill would have continued to Moorgate. Advanced works modernising the track began in the late 1930s being interrupted by the Second World War. Works were completed from Highgate to High Barnet and Mill Hill East with that section incorporated into the Northern line. Works on the tracks between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace were halted with the LNER continuing to operate the line. In 1942, LNER, were reduced to rush hour only operations because of wartime economies. After the war, no work was undertaken as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on LPTB funds. Funds for new works were severely limited with priority given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights plan. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) closed the line temporarily from 29 October 1951 until 7 January 1952, before the last passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace ran on 3 July 1954. The line continued to be used for goods services until 14 June 1956Disused Stations by N.Catford website May 2020Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley page 71 when it was closed completely. The track was removed with platforms and station buildings demolished. The trackbed between Muswell Hill and Finsbury Park is now the Parkland Walk.
