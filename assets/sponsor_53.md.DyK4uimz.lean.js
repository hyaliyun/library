In order to communicate more effectively, she describes the different uses of the term \\"trace\\" in plain language, shows that the \\"trace does not speak\\", that it is human beings who interpret a part of reality, calling it trace in terms of semiotic dynamics issuing from their relationship that is aware of the reality of their history.

(), back cover i.e. a body in which is recorded every consequence of the individuals' interactions with the environments they have passed through over time. For the author, a human being‚Äôs body-trace, (there is no separation between the body and the mind) possesses a plasticity which is the result of the interactions with the surroundings in which he/she lives (nature, culture, techniques, society, etc.) The interactions of a body with its surroundings, being specific to each individual, the resulting body-trace is recorded in a difference, which modulates the reception of what is perceptible. To signify that the perception and interpretation of the sign are the consequences, the author suggests the term sign-trace.Galinon-M√©l√©nec B√©atrice, \\"Le paradigme des signes-traces : fragments\\", Handicap psychique et recrutement, 2, 2012, p. 17-35 The interpretation that each human makes of the real arises from anthroposemiotics in which the signs appear as the result of an interaction between an individual‚Äôs body-trace and reality. This is assumed to exist in itself (‚Äúthe reality itself‚Äù) and is only accessible to humans through their body and a human‚Äôs interpretation can therefore only be an \\"anthropo-centred reality‚Äù. ‚ÄúRelational embodied semiotics‚Äù,B√©atrice Galinon- M√©l√©nec, \\"√Ä la recherche de la trace\\", Communication et organisation, n¬∞ 47, 2015, p. 31-50 (read on line [archive]) which analyzes bodies‚Äô interaction of sign-traces, has been used by researchers or professionals to analyze interpersonal communication situations where the body is present. In this context, the interpretation of signs emitted by bodies appears as if recorded in a systemic dynamic linking the body-trace of the interpreted and the body- trace of the interpretant within a complex where bodies in co-presence are moved by permanent interactions of traces.B√©atrice Galinon-M√©l√©nec, L'Homme- Trace: Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p.

According to the author, body-trace and environment-trace have been retro-acting in a systemic dynamic since the beginning of humanity, which explains the co-evolution of species and the environment which she analyzes using her \\"theory of General Ichnology\\".Galinon-M√©l√©nec B√©atrice, \\"Pour une ichnologie g√©n√©rale √† l‚Äôheure du num√©rique\\", Communication et traces num√©riques, n¬∞1, Presses universitaires du Havre et de Rouen, 2020 She demonstrates the interest of her applications by analyzing dangerous situations experienced by her contemporaries in the context of the digital society (2009) which she analyzes using her \\"theory of General Ichnology\\" and the health crisis of 2020. The interpretation that the Ichnos-Anthropos makes of the real comes from anthroposemiotics, where signs appear as the result of an interaction between the body-trace of Ichnos- Anthropos and the reality-trace of the world. With the anthropological Human- Trace paradigm, B√©atrice Galinon-M√©l√©nec sets the figurative stage of homo (sapiens or otherwise) from any era whose body carries traces (ichnos) of the past (his or those of humans who have preceded him) and whose present relationship with the world participates permanently in the production of a future integrating the \\"consequence-traces\\" of his present actions.GALINON- MELENEC B√©atrice, \\"The future of the \\"Homme-trace\\", A substantial societal challenge\\", NETCOM, 28-1/2 (2014), pp. 107-130, (published in English), http://netcom.revues.org/1554. As the \\"Human-Trace\\" term was circulated and appropriated by other authors, it lost the paradigmatic dimension initially sought by the author.

Nevertheless, if reference is made to certain indexing tools like Google Scholar, citations lead us to conclude that their uses in French articles in the humanities between 2008-2018 were more often linked to the evocative power of the words that form them than the systemic, dynamic and multi-scale perspective that they encompass for their author.

Like its predecessor, the Starfinder RPG supports adventure paths and other material written by Paizo and third party publishers. Background Starfinder draws inspiration from many other science-fiction and space opera franchises, including Star Wars, Alien, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Warhammer 40,000. Paizo first released a science-fiction product in 2012, with the Distant Worlds supplement to Pathfinder. After the success of Distant Worlds, Paizo decided to create the new system, using it as a base. The Starfinder RPG was announced in May 2016 on Paizo's website and officially released at Gen Con in August 2017. Design Starfinder is based on Paizo's previous game, Pathfinder, and like its predecessor uses the d20 system created by Wizards of the Coast for Dungeons & Dragons. Starfinder shares its setting with Pathfinder, set in its far future after Golarion, the planet that Pathfinder was set on, had mysteriously disappeared in an event called \\"The Gap\\". The history of the planet during the disappearance is lost to all races, preventing players from returning and interfering with previous events in the Pathfinder timeline, while also acting as the foundation of Starfinder's own timeline. Because Starfinder shares its past with Pathfinder, magic remains a part of the game's mechanics, often intertwined with high-level technology, and races and monsters of the Pathfinder setting persist in the Starfinder universe. Similar to Pathfinder, the game features personal combat using weapons and magic, though these systems have been simplified and adjusted to the futuristic setting. In addition, Starfinder also has rules regarding starships, space combat, and faster-than-light travel. Starfinder retains the traditional fantasy races as choices for players (for example, elves, dwarves, and orcs), but offers a different set of races as the standard, including the reptilian vesk and rat-like ysoki, while also offering several non-traditional choices such as a \\"seven-armed starfish\\". Starfinder also introduces a new array of seven character classes for players to choose from, which can be further customized, and body augmentations which can give different abilities. Starfinder is designed so that content from Pathfinder can be easily converted to Starfinder and vice versa; the game has guidelines on converting characters and monsters between the two systems. Reception Early reviews praised Starfinder for its streamlined rules and expansive, flexible setting. The new starship combat rules also received praise, though some criticism was pointed at its repetitiveness and lack of options. Starfinder won the 2018 Origins Award for Fan Favorite Role-Playing Game.The Academy of Adventure Game Arts and Design (2018): Origins Awards Winners2018 - 44th Annual Ceremony (pdf). Supplementary material and related products Paizo and audio app developer Syrinscape partnered to create an official set of sound effects for Starfinder, and Paizo licensed design studio Ninja Division to create plastic miniatures. These were released alongside the general launch of the game in August 2017. Paizo along with Audible created a Starfinder Alexa skill adventure pilot episode \\"Scoundrels in the Spike\\" released in December 2019. The pilot was considered successful, leading Amazon to have Pazio and Audible create a full six-episode adventure based on the \\"Dead Suns\\" campaign, which was first released in August 2020. The adventure, including the pilot, includes voice acting from Nathan Fillion and Laura Bailey along with eleven others. According to Bailey, the voice acting for the newer episodes were done from home studios due to the COVID-19 pandemic though working together online when characters interacted with each other. Within the skill, the user is able to select one of five main characters, and then make certain decisions that can affect the outcome of the story, as well as initiate the game's skill checks and determine how combat progresses; the rules have been simplified from the tabletop version to adapt to voice commands. The skill's pilot episode and first episode of the new campaign were available for free with the remaining episodes available to purchase.

Historical and Cultural Moment  In ‚ÄúA Twig of a Wish,‚Äù(Persian: ŸÜŸáÿßŸÑ ÿ¢ÿ±ÿ≤Ÿà) Parvin Etesami complains about the lack of respect and opportunities for woman. She asserts women's importance in pointing out that women are in charge of nurturing and educating all children (male and female), they should have greater respect and an equal chance for education as men. Her poem ‚ÄúA Twig of a Wish‚Äù was written when it was not unusual for women to be forced into marriages at young ages. Women's lives were very restricted during that time in Iran, and poetry was the only art in which a woman could express her thoughts and feelings. In such an atmosphere, Etesami and other early modern women writers in Iran provided a strong feminist claim for women's rights.  About A Twig of a Wish Etesami's poem ‚ÄúA Twig of a Wish‚Äù was written for her high school graduation ceremony from the Iran Bethel School in the spring of 1924. To the assembled audience at the girls‚Äô school's ceremony, it was daring for Etesami to speak out directly about the importance of women's education and rights just before and during the Reza Shah era. What can be learned from her poems is that she had passion to learn and was aware of social issues. Her poems are full of spiritual truth and sympathy for the poor and the oppressed. Parvin Etesami (1907-1941) grew up in an intellectual environment under supervision of her father who had a literary personality. That is why she became familiar with the thoughts of literary society. She married her father's cousin who was much older than her and soon after got divorced for his addition to drug and corruption. Her husband didn't let her write poets. After her divorce, her poems were published in Bahar magazine.

She competed in the 4 √ó 100 metres relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics and the 1964 Summer Olympics as well as the 80 metres hurdles in 1964. Dunn finished third in the 200 metres with a time of 24.7 seconds and finished fourth in the 80 metres hurdles at the 1963 Pan American Games. Dunn's international breakthrough came when she won a gold medal in the 4 x 100 metres relay at the 1959 Central American and Caribbean Games as a 16-year old. She also won a silver medal in the 80 metres hurdles and a bronze in the 4 x 100 metres relay at the 1962 Central American and Caribbean Games. Early life Dunn was born in Panama City into a family of accomplished athletes. Her father was a competitive weightlifter before becoming an accountant for the Panama Canal, and her aunt Josephine Lewis Sampson held many of the country's records in hurdles (these records were in turn later broken by Dunn). In 1960, Dunn, along with her relay teammates Silvia Hunte, Carlota Gooden and Jean Holmes-Mitchell, were the first female athletes to represent Panama at the Olympics. They set a Panamanian 4 x 100 metres women's relay record of 46.66 seconds that was not equalled until 2013. After she graduated from high school in 1961, Wilma Rudolph's coach, the legendary Ed Temple, offered her a track scholarship to train under him at Tennessee State University. She competed for the powerhouse TSU Tigerbelles and graduated from Tennessee State with honours in 1965. The Tigerbelles dominated US women's track and field during this era. In fact, from 1960 to 1968 they did not lose an AAU National Championship and won nearly every single competitive team meet they participated in during those years.Salisbury, Tracey.

He designed buildings in various styles, including Neoclassicism, Rococo Revival, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau and Neo-Romanesque. His masterpiece is the basilica of Ta' Pinu in Gozo, while other notable works include the domes of the ƒ¶amrun and Siƒ°ƒ°iewi parish churches, Villa Rosa and the now-demolished Casa Said. Biography Neo-Gothic house near the Mdina cathedral, known as Casa Gourgion Vassallo was born in the town of Luqa on 2 January 1856. He initially worked as a stone sculptor, but by 1887 he had been involved in many aspects of the construction industry, including designing, building or remodeling various buildings and structures to a variety of patrons. He entered government service on 21 December 1887, taking over the late Webster Paulson's post of Clerk of Works. In 1892, he was admitted into the Institution of British Civil Engineers on the recommendation of Sir Lintorn Simmons and Sir Osbert Chadwick. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1907, and was finally granted the Warrant of Land Surveyor and Architect on 7 November 1908. This was condemned by the Istituto dei Periti since Vassallo had never formally studied architecture. Vassallo was awarded the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Pius X for his services during the Eucharistic Congress of 1913, for which he had designed a tribune. Works Villa Rosa Vassallo designed or was involved in the construction of many buildings and structures, including hospitals, schools, workshops and houses, and he used various architectural styles throughout his career. One of his notable works was a wrought iron conservatory at the Argotti Botanic Gardens, which was built sometime before 1907. This was a unique structure in Malta, but it was later demolished due to high maintenance costs. Vassallo also designed the Neoclassical Sliema Government Elementary School, which was built in around 1908‚Äì10. Residential buildings designed by Vassallo include a Neo-Gothic house located near the Mdina Cathedral. Its design was well received by the public, but it was also criticized since its style does not blend well with its surroundings. He also designed two Art Nouveau houses which were built in the 1920s: Villa Rosa in St. Julian's and the now- demolished Casa Said in Sliema. ƒ¶amrun parish church Ta' Pinu basilica In the 1920s, Vassallo won a competition for the design of the dome of the Parish Church of St. Cajetan in ƒ¶amrun, which would eventually be built in 1953‚Äì55 under the direction of ƒ†u≈º√® Damato. Despite being constructed decades after his death, the dome was built to his original designs with structural alterations made by Damato. This is regarded as being one of the finest domes in Malta. Vassallo also designed the dome of the Church of St. Nicholas in Siƒ°ƒ°iewi (1919), the Rococo Revival Sanctuary of Our Lady of Tal-ƒ¶erba in Birkirkara (1923), and the Neo-Romanesque basilica of Ta' Pinu in Gozo. The latter is regarded as Vassallo's masterpiece due to its monumentality and intricate design, although it is sometimes criticized as being alien in its surroundings. He designed numerous prominent 19th century Victorian townhouses at Saqqajja in Rabat, Malta. Vassallo died on 28 January 1928 at the Zammit Clapp Hospital, which he had designed himself in 1910. His son, Edwin Vassallo, was also an architect. Vassallo's legacy is sometimes overlooked since many of his buildings are often wrongly attributed to other architects.

The film stars Catherine Zeta- Jones as Griselda Blanco, who was known as the Cocaine Godmother. It premiered at the 2017 Camerimage in Poland and showed on Lifetime channel on January 20, 2018. Plot Griselda Blanco grows up in poverty in Colombia, and commits her first murder after being forced into childhood prostitution. She eventually comes to live to the US with her first husband and three sons Dixon, Uber, and Osvaldo. She earns money by creating fake passports for cocaine smugglers, and moves into the smuggling trade herself when she realizes that using beautiful women as mules will lower the chances of them being caught. Griselda, fed up with her abusive marriage, leaves her husband and takes her children. She meets Carolina, an American woman with whom she begins a romance. Griselda soon gets remarried to a man named Alberto Bravo, but keeps Carolina as a companion for years. After moving to Miami, Griselda's drug empire quickly grows. She comes up with the idea to put assassins on motorcycles as they'll be able to move around the city faster than with cars. She does business with Pablo Escobar back in Colombia, and becomes the queen of the cocaine trade. As a result, Miami sees a steep rise in crime. Griselda and her family are pushed to the edge by the stress of their illegal business. Her three eldest sons have all become dangerous gangsters. Her marriage falls apart and Carolina dies of a drug overdose. Her fourth son Michael, fathered by her most recent boyfriend Dar√≠o Sep√∫lveda, is kidnapped and it takes weeks to get him back home. Griselda, herself, develops an addiction to smoking cocaine that makes her increasingly irrational and unreliable. The DEA have been watching her operation for years. She moves to Los Angeles to lie low, but is eventually found and arrested along with her three sons while Michael is sent to live with a relative in Miami. Griselda serves limited jail time thanks to the loyalty she commands among her minions. After doing her time, she is deported back to Colombia where she lives a lonely existence after two of her sons were killed by assailants and the other one commits suicide before he can be killed. She dies an old woman when a motorcycle assassin shoots her on the street.

Up to 1969, Ingenheim had been an autonomous borough.  Geography  The village lies in the Southern Palatinate, part of it belongs to the nature preserve \\"Klingbachtal-Kaiserbachtal\\". North of the village centre runs the Klingbach. The region belongs to the Northern Rhine Rift Valley. Ingenheim lies southwest of the district of Billigheim and south of the district of Appenhofen. Federal road no. 38 connects the village to the central towns of Landau in der Pfalz and Bad Bergzabern. Various dwelling places, like Dorfm√ºhle, Friedrichshof, Im alten Grund, Im Peterswingert, Kehlerhof, Luisenhof and St. Georgenhof, are part of Ingenheim as well.  History  Village names with the ending ‚Äú-heim‚Äú in the Upper Rhine area are attributed to the time of Frankish colonisation (5th to 7th century). Ingenheim presumably derives from the personal name Ingo. Therefore, Ingenheim was settled by a person named Ingo. The first documented mentions of the village name dates back to 1236 and 1238, when two Burgmannen of Landeck Castle, a Konrad of Ingenheim and a Heinrich von Ingenheim, acted as witnesses to a gift of goods from the town of [Klingenm√ºnster  [M√ºnster to the Klingenm√ºnster Abbey. The knights of Ingenheim appear quite frequently in documents of this time up to the middle of the 15th century. The village Ingenheim was originally a fief belonging to the Klingenm√ºnster Abbey. As such, as a property of Castle Meistersel, half of the village was pawned by Otto von Ochsenstein in 1369 to Konrad Landschad von Steinach. In 1395 Friedrich von Ochsenstein sold the other half to the Bishopric of Speyer. In the 16th century the village became the property of the barons of Gemmingen and remained in their possession up to the end of the 18th century. In 1792, after the French Revolution (1789), the region became part of France. Under French administration, Ingenheim belonged from 1794 onwards to the Canton of Landau, which was assigned to the Arrondissement of Wissembourg in the Bas-Rhin department (department of the Lower Rhine). In 1804, 798 inhabitants boasted the village. While the Canton of Landau, and therefore Ingenheim as well, was assigned to France during the first Treaty of Paris (1814), this part of the department of the Lower Rhine located north of the river Lauter came under the sovereign territory of [Austrian Empire  [Austria with the second Treaty of Paris (1815). The remaining areas of the Palatinate region, formerly belonging to the department of the Mont-Tonnerre, were given to Austria at the Congress of Vienna in June 1815. With the Treaty of Munich in April 1816, the entire Palatinate region was reassigned from the Austrian Empire to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Under Bavarian administration, Ingenheim first remained in the Bavarian Canton of Landau. Due to territorial adjustments in 1817, Ingenheim was reclassified together with 5 additional municipalities to the Canton of Bergzabern, which was assigned to the County Commissariat Bergzabern (from 1862 known as District Administrative of Bergzabern). The municipality of Ingenheim had an autonomous administration. In 1819 and 1925, Daniel Bourquin was mayor of Ingenheim. During the 19th century, Ingenheim was the largest Jewish community in the Palatinate. In the 1830s, a total of 1,631 inhabitants were living in Ingenheim, of which 551 were Jewish. The synagogue, which was destroyed in 1938, was built in 1831/1832. From 1869 to 1884, Ingenheim even had a Jewish mayor with Bernhard Roos (1796-1888). According to 1928 official index of towns for the free state of Bavaria, a total of 1,315 inhabitants lived in 277 residential buildings in the rural community of Ingenheim. 531 inhabitants were Catholics, 687 were Protestants, 96 were Jews, and one was designated as \\"other‚Äú. The municipality covered 554 hectares. There was a Catholic and a Protestant parish, a Catholic, a Protestant, and a Jewish school as well as a post office. The train station ‚ÄúIngenheim-Appenhofen‚Äú, on the route of the ‚ÄúKlingbachtalbahn‚Äú, was located in Ingenheim. The village mill with its six inhabitants belonged to the municipality as well. In the course of the first territorial and administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the formerly autonomous municipality of Ingenheim, with at that time 1,436 inhabitants, was dissolved on June 7, 1969. Together with the municipalities of Appenhofen, Billigheim and M√ºhlhofen, the new municipality of Billigheim-Ingenheim was formed. At the same time, the district Bergzabern was dissolved and the municipality of Billigheim-Ingenheim was assigned to the new district Landau-Bad Bergzabern (renamed to S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe in 1977).  Transport  Between 1892 and 1967, Ingenheim was connected to the railway network by the ‚ÄúKlingbachtalbahn‚Äú. The corresponding train station ‚ÄúIngenheim-Appenhofen‚Äú was located in Ingenheim. The nearest train station since then is Rohrbach.

Country The Ngarinjin tribal lands were estimated by Norman Tindale to encompass some from Walcott Inlet at Mount Page. To the southeast their boundaries ran along the northern face of the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. Their land included the Isdell Valley to Isdell Range, running east as far as the Phillips Range, the headwaters of the Chapman River, Blackfellow Creek, and Wood River. Their confines to the north lay along the Barnett and Harris Ranges, and to where the Gibb River joins with the upper Drysdal across to the Maitland Range. They were present also at the King River headwaters, as far as around about Mount Reid. Their western frontier was set at Mounts Bradshaw and Han. Their territory to the southeast reached Mount French on the highlands. Social organization The Ngarinjin were composed of roughly 40 hordes. Each of these local divisions had its own distinctive each with a clan and moiety classification. History Before the coming of white settlement, it appears that the Ngarinjin were pressing south into territory held by the Punaba. Ethnography The German ethnographer Helmut Petri, during the Frobenius expedition of 1938-1939, lived among the Ngarinjin and took copious notes on the lore language and mythology of the Ngarinjin, and gathered many objects of their traditional craftsmanship.

The House of Lords unanimously upheld the general rule at common law that foreign tax claims are non-justiciable in England under the Act of state doctrine. Accordingly, a claim with respect to foreign taxes was not an admissible claim in the liquidation of a United Kingdom company. The English courts may not, directly or indirectly, enforce the tax claims of another sovereign state. Facts The Delhi Electric Supply & Traction Co Ltd was an English company which was formed in 1906. It was incorporated for the purpose of operating an electricity supply and tramway under an operating licence granted by the Municipality of Delhi. The company carried on business in India until approximately 1947 when it sold the whole of its undertakings to the Government of India on 2 March 1947. On 18 April 1947 India passed the Indian Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax (Amendment) Act 1947. On 25 May 1949 the company went into voluntary liquidation. Samuel Taylor and John LoveringLovering would later die, and on 9 July 1953 was replaced by William Hume as joint liquidator were appointed as liquidators, having previously acted as directors of the company. On 24 October 1951 the Commissioner of Income Tax at Delhi served a notice claiming tax on the surplus from the sale of undertaking.[1955] AC 491 at 492-493 The liquidators rejected the claim, and sought directions from the court as to whether the claim was an admissible claim in the liquidation. Decision The case came before Vaisey J at first instance who dismissed the claim. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal (Lord Evershed MR, Jenkins LJ and Morris LJ). The Government of India then appealed to the House of Lords. All five members of the House of Lords were unanimous that the claim must fail. Viscount Simonds gave the lead judgment. He commenced his speech by saying \\"My Lords, I will admit that I was greatly surprised to hear it suggested that the courts of this country would and should entertain a suit by a foreign State to recover a tax.\\" He summarised the general prohibition at common law, citing various earlier cases on point, including King of Hellenes v Broston (1923) 16 Ll L Rep 190, Re Visser [1928] Ch 877 and Sydney Municipal Council v Bull [1909] 1 KB 7. Having cited the general rule, he then discussed the two alternative grounds upon which counsel for the Government of India was arguing that an exception should be made: * Firstly, that as India was a republic within the Commonwealth, recognising the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth, it should not be treated in the same way as other wholly foreign countries; and * Secondly, that the general rule applied to natural persons and personal claims - neither consideration should apply to a company in winding-up, which is required to make provision for all claims made against it. Viscount Simonds rejected both arguments, describing them as \\"frail weapons with which to attack a strong fortress\\".[1955] AC 491 at 506 He noted that the general common law had tacit Parliamentary approval in the passing of the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, section 1(2)(b). He ultimately summarily rejected both arguments. Lord Keith gave a short concurring judgment, specifically endorsing the recent judgment in Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey [1954] Ir 89 (unreported at the time). Lord Somervell also gave a short concurring speech, affirming the general statement of Lord Mansfield CJ in Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343 that \\"no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another.\\" He then went on to state that \\"after considerable research no case of any country could be found in which taxes due to State A had been enforced in the courts of State B.\\" Authority Government of India v Taylor remains good law today. It forms the central basis of Rule 3 of Dicey Morris & Collins on The Conflict of Laws, and is one of the primary authorities cited in support of that rule: However it has been qualified by subsequent authorities. In QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual indemnity for the payment of taxes would not constitute indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim. It has also been noted that in practice the effect of the rule is widely circumvented by international treaties.

Her father was vicar and her grandfather is thought to have been Ralph Hutchinson, who was a biblical scholar and college head at Oxford University. Quakerism spread during Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth that followed the English Civil War. Anne Downer joined the Religious Society of Friends in London in 1654. In 1655 she became the first Quaker woman preacher, for which she was imprisoned and beaten. In 1656 she preached in Chadlington, and then went to Launceston prison in Cornwall to serve as secretary to the Quaker leader George Fox. She then preached at her home town of Charlbury, where Quaker meetings were held in the homes of William Cole and Alexander Harris. Both men were jailed in 1657‚Äì1658 for refusing to pay tithes to the Church of England; Cole died in prison. Many Quakers in Charlbury were distrained for refusing to pay the Church Rate. In 1660 a Chadlington Quaker who attended the Charlbury meetings was jailed for refusing to swear the Oath of Allegiance, and in 1663 Henry Shad, a Quaker schoolmaster, was barred from teaching.

Personal life Plymley was baptized at Longnor, Shropshire, on 31 January 1758. She was the eldest child of Joseph Plymley (1716‚Äì1802) of the Bank House, Longnor, and Diana, n√©e Flint (1725‚Äì1779), a member of the Shropshire gentry family of Corbett. Her siblings were Joseph (1759‚Äì1838), archdeacon of Ludlow from 1792 to 1830 and Ann (1760‚Äì1829). The sisters were educated at home and were involved in their father‚Äôs apothecary business. Neither married but they helped care for their brother's 13 children from his two wives. They were particularly involved in the education of these children. Plymley died on 2 September 1829 and is buried in Leebotwood. Paintings, diaries and travel journals A large number of water colour paintings, diaries and study notebooks authored by Plymley have survived and are now held by Shropshire Archives, Shrewsbury, UK. Plymley studied natural sciences, specialising in entomology. She produced over 400 watercolour paintings, many of which show the life-cycles of butterflies and moths from egg to adult, and which were often drawn from life as she maintained the insects and their food plants through their life-cycle. She kept up with scientific developments and, through her scholarship, was in communication with academics including Frederick William Hope. Her writings survive in 210 notebooks, many of which are not dated. They comprise 9 memoirs of her father (written after 1802) and a niece (written after 1807), 29 travel journals, 138 diaries (covering 1791‚Äì1827) and 34 undated study notebooks. These give accounts of her opinions as well as factual information. The Industrial Revolution began in the West Midlands area where she lived, and her family were part of Shropshire society that included families such as the Darwins and Wedgewoods and that also hosted visitors who were political and religious activists. She therefore met people of both local and national significance, and recorded diaries, observations and opinions covering the period between 1781 and 1827. Several of these people either visited or stayed with the Plymley family, giving an opportunity for candid and informal accounts, including of radicalism among the cultured elite. One example was Thomas Clarkson, who campaigned against slavery; several of her earlier diaries are full of accounts of campaigns and progress towards the abolition of the slave trade. Other people she described for their character and conversation included Josiah Wedgewood, radical clergyman Reverend Archibald Alison, architect Charles Bage, botanist Theophilus Houlbrooke and playwright and philanthropist Hannah More. Her accounts also give insight into the attitudes and preoccupations of society. Her travel journals include accounts of repeated visits to London and Bath, a tour of North Wales, and travels to Oxford, Cambridge and Penzance. As a result, she describes seeing some of William Herschel's telescopes in 1796, the first trials of Richard Trevithick's steam engine in Penzance in 1803 and meeting the Ladies of Llangollen in 1792. She was acquainted with travel writers such as Thomas Pennant and William Gilpin, and visited the home of the former for several days in 1792 on her way to Anglesey. The study notebooks provide an account of her lifelong programme of self-improvement from 1781 onwards. She concentrated on topics such as religion, education, moral philosophy and biography, and in her notebooks recorded both extracts from books she had read and her commentary on them. She wrote about the position of unmarried women, and strongly held that girls should be educated. Legacy There was an exhibition of her paintings in 1997 in Shrewsbury Museum and several are now on permanent display there.

Designed by Nathaniel Dudley Goodell, the house was built in 1888, in an Italianate style with elements of Greek Revival. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 2002. House The house is built of redwood timber on a brick foundation in a primarily Italianate style; it has two stories and twenty rooms, It was designed by Nathaniel Dudley Goodell of Sacramento and built on farmed land; the brick smokehouse and the three- story water tank house, attached to the house in the late 19th century, date to the period of its construction, with the iron doors to the smokehouse reportedly having originally belonged to the Maine Prairie Rifles militia armory, which was built in about 1863. The plan of the house resembles a \\"Z\\", with wings at the northeast and southwest corners. The siding is also redwood, with pilaster corners and triangular pedimented gables constituting elements of Greek Revival style. A porch with Tuscan-style columns wraps around the south and east sides of the house, and there is a balustraded balcony on the second floor. The gable ends have fishtail shingles, and the cornice is ornamented with carved brackets with finials. Carved crowns appear above both the windows and the ventilators in the gable ends. History Jackson Fay Brown, who was from Vermont and came to California via Panama in the 1850s, became a wealthy farmer in the Dixon area and served as a supervisor and deputy assessor in Solano County and then in 1889 as a California assemblyman. He had the house built after building two previous houses himself; construction began in July 1887 and finished in January 1888, at a cost of between $8,000 and $11,000. It was lit by gas and surrounded by fruit trees and a vineyard. Brown died suddenly in April 1910 and his wife presumably inherited the house; after her death their youngest son, Clayton Brown, who was disabled, remained there and in the 1930s part of the property was converted into a separate residence. After his death in 1957 the house passed to his nephew. The Brown family divided the land, and finally sold the house in 1994. It was unoccupied in the 1970s and 1980s and fell into disrepair; it was restored in the late 1990s, including replication in redwood of some damaged columns, corner boards, and decorative elements with changes to the placement of windows and doors and the removal of one of the three chimneys. At some point a windmill originally attached to the tank house was removed. A horse barn, garages, a pump house, a shed, and a gazebo were constructed during the 20th century, and a conservatory was added to the house in 1992.

It is one of the most frequent species of Cladophialophora implicated in human disease. Cladophialophora carrionii is a causative agent of chromoblastomycosis, a subcutaneous infection that occurs in sub-tropical areas such as Madagascar, Australia and northwestern Venezuela. Transmission occurs through traumatic implantation of plant material colonized by C. carrionii, mainly infecting rural workers. When C. carrionii infects its host, it transforms from a mycelial state to a muriform state to better tolerate the extreme conditions in the host's body. Habitat and ecology Infections by C. carrionii typically arise following traumatic inoculation of material colonized by the fungus. Most infections are reported from dry rural agricultural areas regions. Cladophialophora carrionii is saprotrophic, occurring mainly on decaying plant material such as wood where it produces enzymes that allow it to utilize lignin as a nutrient source. Cladophialophora carrionii is also found in pine trees, eucalyptus fence posts (which are often used in farming to protect crops), soil and dead cactus spines where it derives its nutrition from carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins in the plant tissue. Morphology Cladophialophora carrionii is part of a group of melanized fungi, also known as ‚Äúblack yeasts‚Äù because its mycelial form has a dark green colour and its conidia have brown pigment. Colonies grow at a modest rate on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The conidia of C. carrionii are unicellular oval-shaped spores that are distinguishable due to the presence of two lightly pigmented scars. Conidia vary in length (1.5-3.0 √ó 2.0-7.5 ¬µm). Its long conidiophores are similar to the genus Cladosporium, which comes from the Latin word \\"clado\\", meaning branched. The genus Cladophialophora is distinguished from Cladosporium because in addition to chains of conidia, members of the genus Cladophialophora also produce phialides. Cladophialophora carrionii is a dimorphic pathogen that changes states from a mycelial form to a muriform, yeast-like state once it invades its host. Muriform cells are golden-brown in colour due to melanin deposition and have thick cell walls. Growth and reproduction Like many other black yeasts, C. carrionii is sensitive to temperatures above 37 ¬∞C. It can be distinguished in culture by the presence of its urease enzyme hydrolyzing urea and its inability to liquefy gelatin. Altering temperatures or micronutrient levels such as calcium and phosphate affects whether C. carrionii is in the mycelial or muriform state. The fungus transforms to muriform cells under conditions of temperature between 25 ¬∞C to 37 ¬∞C, 0.1 mM Ca2+, and a pH of 2.5. It produces multiple conidia in long, straight chains that bud off the hyphae, with the youngest conidia farthest from the hyphae. There is no sexual state known for C. carrionii. Disease in humans Cladophialophora carrionii can cause a disease called chromoblastomycosis in individuals with a normal functioning immune system, unlike many other pathogenic fungi that can only cause disease in immunocompromised individuals. It is one of the most common agents of chromoblastomycosis. The fungus changes states once it invades the animal host from the mycelial state to muriform cells that spread outward radially. This dimorphism has been suggested to increase the tolerance of C. carrionii to extreme conditions, such as the high temperature and acidity in the human body. Muriform cells increase cell number by septum formation within the hyphae, rather than by budding. Chromoblastomycosis results in subcutaneous, crusty lesions that can spread over large areas on different parts of the body such as the legs, arms and face. If not treated, the lesions continue to increase in size over the body, but do not usually pose a risk of mortality. As the lesions grow, they can take on multiple forms that resemble nodes, tumours (resemble cauliflowers), and plaques. Infection causes inflammation of the leg or foot tissue, resulting in granulomas. =Epidemiology= Chromoblastomycosis is found worldwide, most prominently in tropical and sub- tropical regions such as Mexico, Madagascar, Brazil, China, and Malaysia but some cases have been reported in the United States and Europe. Cladophialophora carrionii causes only a minor subset of chromoblastomycosis cases, most notably in drier locations such as Madagascar, Australia and northwestern Venezuela, which are rife with plants inhabited by the fungus. Many cases of chromoblastomycosis cases target males over the age of thirty because they are predominant in the agricultural industry in rural areas, where deforestation must be carried out to provide agricultural land and they directly work with the plants that are commonly colonized by C. carrionii. =Pathogenesis and treatment= Chromoblastomycosis infection occurs by subcutaneous puncture by a thorn or splinter that is infected with C. carrionii, such as decaying cacti and wood. Scratching at the lesions worsens the infection by spreading the fungus over larger and distal areas of the body. Field workers who work without foot protection or clothing covering legs and arms are at greater risk for inoculation by material colonized by C. carrionii. Immunocompromised individuals are also at risk, because the ability to produce antibodies against fungal proteins is critical in minimizing fungal pathogenicity and C. carrionii may penetrate deeper into muscle and bone layers if the patient is immunosuppressed. Even if an individual is immunocompetent, they may be at risk if they carry the HLA-A29 antigen, since its presence may increase an individual‚Äôs susceptibility to contracting chromoblastomycosis. Histology tests from a skin biopsy can identify muriform cells that are commonly found in chromoblastomycosis. Identifying the specific agent that caused chromoblastomycosis can be done by PCR assays or culturing the fungus by growing it on an agar plate and observing the colony morphology and sporulation characteristics. However, C. carrionii grows quite slowly in culture, so significant results cannot be obtained until after 4‚Äì6 weeks of incubation. During infection, the immune system of the host attempts to eliminate the fungus via engulfment and degradation by macrophages and neutrophils, which function in the innate immune system. The adaptive immune system also plays a role by activating cells such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), the type of IL specifically produced with C. carrionii infection, but it may have negative consequences for eradicating the fungus. It is postulated that the presence of melanin in black yeasts like C. carrionii contributes to pathogenicity because it strengthens the fungal cell wall and can neutralize the enzymes produced in macrophages that normally function to break down targeted cells. Minor cases of chromoblastomycosis can be resolved by surgery or antifungal medications. Cold therapy (cryosurgery) by applying cool liquid nitrogen onto lesions can be effective if combined with antifungal therapy and chemotherapy. More serious cases must be treated for a prolonged period of time (6 to 12 months) with the antifungals itraconazole and terbinafine. Antifungals have a wide range of effectiveness, curing between 15-80% of cases. However, C. carrionii is sensitive to commonly used antifungals so cure rates are higher than seen in chromoblastomycosis infections caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Treatments less effective if the infection is chronic, resulting in high relapse rates.

History Football from Gala»õi can boast a long and rich history. If the sport with the round ball appeared in the cities of Arad and Bucharest shortly before 1900, in Gala»õi arrived about ten years later. This was possible due to the presence in the city of foreign trade companies and representations. The first games took place in 1908, when a team set up by officer Vladovici met a group of English sailors seated in the harbor. The career soldier, who had studied in France, brought to Gala»õi the first regulation of the football game ‚Äì a ball and a pair of boots. The birth of FC Metalosport Gala»õi club took place in 1937, when other sports groups are attracted by this movement and they worked together with established teams and associations. Among these entities, since 1937 Metalosport appeared, the first metallurgical group whose presence on the divisional stage is registered in the Divizia C championship, in the Seria II of the South League, in the competitive year 1937‚Äì38 (5th place at the end of the championship). The third league ‚Äì Divizia C ‚Äì was organized for the first time 73 years ago (1936). It was an autumn-spring edition. The 52 participants were divided into five series ‚Äì according to geographic criteria: north, south, west, center and east. After several years of Divizia C, 1948‚Äì1949, 1963‚Äì1966, and various name changes like Trefilorul or Siderurgistul II in the 1981‚Äì1982 season, the team of Metalosport Gala»õi is reinforced with players from other clubs from Gala»õi and the team leadership together with the team's owner, \\"Cristea Nicolae\\" Factory, aims to promote in the upper Divizia B. At the end of the 1981‚Äì1982 season, Metalosport Gala»õi managed to rank 1st in the championship and promoted to Divizia B.

Origins The book is a work of historical fiction inspired by stories that Isaac (Ike) Sing told to Chiang in the late 1990s. Chiang made two trips, totalling a period of three weeks, to Sing's home in Cawston, British Columbia and recorded many hours of interviews about his own life and the life of his father, Chen Sing. From these recordings Chiang put together the life story of Chen Sing and used it to write the book. The real Chen Sing was born in 1860 and was orphaned at a young age. He lived an impoverished existence in Yin Ping, Guangdong with his elder brother and sister until his teenage years when he left to go to the city of Guangzhou, China to find work.

Six of his portraits, including one of Stephen Hawking, are held by the National Portrait Gallery in London, England. A portrait of Neil deGrasse Tyson by Gamble is held in the collections of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.  Early life and education  Gamble was born in March 1953. In his youth, he was a member of a number of bands in the Cambridge rock scene in the 1970s, including the Inserts, Truth and Rory. He graduated from Ealing School of Art in London, England. After which, he did his postgraduate studies at the Association of Photographers. In 1986, Gamble was an assistant to Neal Slavin during the publication of Slavin's book of photography Britons. For a short period later in 1992, he would serve as a director of the association.  Career  Soon after the death of Andy Warhol, Gamble was permitted access to the artist's East 66th Street, Manhattan apartment to photograph his art work, furniture and myriad of personal effects. The project was commissioned by Sotheby's as part of the publicity for their auction of Warhol's property. A decade later in January 1998, Gamble exhibited a collection of the photographs, taken over a period of eight days, at the Groucho Club in London. Images of Warhol were digitally superimposed on several of the photographs, creating the feeling that to Paul Vallely of The Independent seemed as though \\"the dead man [haunted] the photographs of his living spaces.\\" A notable example in this collection of photographs is a look inside Warhol's medicine cabinet in his private bathroom containing his varies prescription medication and personal hygiene products. This collection of prints has toured several locations, being exhibited at several galleries in the United States. The photograph of his medicine cabinet was also included in \\"Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years\\", an exhibit by Metropolitan Museum of Art that was also presented at The Andy Warhol Museum. In 1987, Gamble was awarded the inaugural Kodak European Awards which is given to professional photographers under 35-years-old. In 1988, Gamble photographed Stephen Hawking in a portrait commissioned by Time Magazine. The photograph was the winner of the second prize in the Science & Technology category of the World Press Photo of the Year award. A copy of the Hawking photograph is currently held in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, England. Other portraits held by the gallery include those of Quentin Crisp, David Lean, Will Self, Alan Sugar and Elisabeth Welch. As a photojournalist, Gamble has worked for Life', Observer, The New Yorker, and Time magazines. His photographs of Dublin, Ireland were also included in and were on the cover of the Observer Magazine's \\"Irish Issue\\" of 30 October 1988. In 2000, Gamble published a photo-book with Will Self entitled Perfidious Man. The book includes several photographs by Gamble accompanied by essays written by Self. The main subject of the photographs and essays is a look into the contemporary concept of masculinity. Gamble moved to the United States in 2000, establishing his residence in The Hamptons. Paintings he created during this period were later exhibited at the New Century Artists Gallery in Manhattan. Gamble and Eric Ernst formed the Artists Secret Society. The society attempts to circumvent the traditional galleries in the Hamptons area. ASS opened an exhibit in July 2008 to promote \\"successful and lesser known\\" artists in the area. Ernst and Gamble also host an interview segment on Plum TV's \\"Morning Noon and Night\\" show. In 2009, some of Gamble's work was added to the collections of the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York. At the museums \\"ac.qui.si.tions\\" exhibit in November 2009, Gamble was on-hand to present and discuss his work with visitors. According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gamble and Helen Matsos were the other two co-creators of the scientific talk show StarTalk.

Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and therefore it is of fundamental nature.Roderick Chisholm, \\"The Problem of the Speckled Hen\\", Mind 51 (1942): pp. 368‚Äì373. Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of knowledge by acquaintance: one is unable to know with certainty the existence of determinate things in one's experience merely by the virtue of the experience.\\"Certainty\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Roderick Chisholm attributes it to Gilbert Ryle suggesting to A. J. Ayer. It is viewed as a criticism of the view expressed by C. I. Lewis that there can never be \\"positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer\\".C. I. Lewis, Mind and the World-Order, p. 128, As cited by Chisholm (1942). Joseph Heath remarks that this problem is one of the \\"descendants of Descartes's 'chiliagon' argument in the sixth of his Meditations\\". Joseph Heath, Following the Rules: Practical Reasoning and Deontic Constraint, Oxford: OUP, 2008, p. 305, note 15). A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it is incorrect to suggest that the \\"sense-data\\" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact they have been enumerated. A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphasizes the fact that there are basic propositions (synthetic propositions which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) that are necessarily imprecise.

It is a dematiaceous (darkly- pigmented) fungus characterized by slow growth and largely asexual reproduction. Cladosporium sphaerospermum consists of a complex of poorly morphologically differentiated, \\"cryptic\\" species that share many physiological and ecological attributes. In older literature, all of these sibling species were classified as C. sphaerospermum despite their unique nature. Accordingly, there is confusion in older literature reports on the physiological and habitat regularities of C. sphaerospermum in the strict sense. This fungus is most phylogenetically similar to C. fusiforme. According to modern phylogenetic analyses, the previously synonymized species, Cladosporium langeroni, is a distinct species. Growth and morphology The hyphae of Cladosporium sphaerospermum are thick walled, septate, and olivaceous-brown in colour. Colonies of the fungus are velvety in texture and flattened (i.e., rarely raised, fluffy, or radially furrowed). C. sphaerospermum conidiophores are branched, septate, and dark, up to 150‚Äì300 Œºm long and 3.5‚Äì4.0 Œºm wide. The structure of the conidiophores are tree-like, a prominent feature of the genus Cladosporium. Unlike other related species, the conidiophores of this species lack swollen nodes at the branching points. Conidia of this species are characteristically globose to ellipsoid with a diameter of 3.4‚Äì4.0 Œºm. The conidia are formed in branching chains in which the youngest conidium is situated at the top. Cladosporium sphaerospermum also produces ramoconidia 6‚Äì14 √ó 3.5‚Äì4.0 Œºm in length and this feature can be used as a method of distinguishing between similar species. Ramoconidia are conidia found at the branching points joining multiple spore chains and can be recognized by one end having a single attachment scar and the other end having two or more attachment scars. Cladosporium sphaerospermum is also a psychrophilic fungus, known to grow at temperatures as low as ‚Äì5 ¬∞C with an upper limit of and no growth at . The optimal temperature this fungus grows under is . This fungus is xerotolerant as it can thrive in environments with low water activity caused by high salinity (halotolerant) or other dissolved solutes. This fungus has been observed to grow in as low as 0.815 aw in vitro. Physiology Cladosporium sphaerospermum is considered a saprotroph and is a secondary invader of dead or dying plant tissue. Energy is provided through the conversion of starch, cellulose, and sucrose to alcohol and carbon dioxide. However, it has been shown in a laboratory environment that these fungi are able to successfully grow with toluene as the sole source of carbon. This trait may have arisen because these fungi and many others from the genus Cladosporium are secondary colonizers and frequently dwell in environments poor in nutrients. Cladosporium sphaerospermum is able to enhance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation in soils due to reactive oxygen species produced as secondary metabolites, such as H2O2. This species is a prolific producer of the pigmented secondary metabolite, melanin, thought to serve as a protective mechanism against UV irradiation, enzymatic lysis, oxidant attack, and fungal infections from other competing fungi. A method that can be used to determine the presence of this fungus on a background of other organic material is through the KOH test which stains the fungus. The addition of lactophenol blue with this test turns the chitin in the cell wall blue but leaves the budding conidia and globular conidiophores with their characteristic brown colouring. The first draft sequence of the C. sphaerospermum genome was created in 2012. Genes were identified that are involved in the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin biosynthesis pathway which confirms the etiology of melanin in this species. Genes associated with the production of allergens were also identified as well as those conferring resistance to various antifungal drugs. Habitat and ecology Cladosporium sphaerospermum is a cosmopolitan fungus that inhabits city buildings and the environment and because of its airborne nature it can move rapidly between locations, though the extent of this is lacking in research. It is found in hypersaline environments in Mediterranean and tropical climates, as well as soil and plant environments in temperate climates. The indoor presence of this fungus can signify there is a condensation problem within the building such as on bathroom walls and in kitchens. Cladosporium sphaerospermum is also been shown to inhabit paint films on walls and other surfaces as well as old paintings. This fungus is also able to grow on gypsum-based material with and without paint and wallpaper. Plant materials that are affected include citrus leaves on various other decaying plant leaves, on the stems of herbaceous and woody plants, on fruits and vegetables. The fungus has also been reported from wheat-based bakery items. Human health  Cladosporium sphaerospermum is mainly known as a spoilage agent of harvested fruits and vegetables. There are very few reports implicating this species as a disease agent in humans. It is known as an allergen and mainly causes problems in patients with respiratory tract diseases as well as subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis and intrabronchial lesions in immunocompetent individuals caused by many dematiaceous fungi. It has been reported rarely from skin, eye, sinus, and brain infections. There has been one reported case in which a female patient developed swelling on the dorsum of her hand which, after testing with Grocott's methenamine silver stain and Lactophenol cotton blue, confirmed the presence of dematiaceous hyphae compatible with C. sphaerospermum. Another case in which identified was where it caused cerebral phaeohyphomycosis but this was treated successfully and the symptoms were abated. Cladosporium sphaerospermum produces allergenic compounds but is not known to produce significant mycotoxins. = Protection against radiation = An experiment has been made at the International Space Station in December 2018 and January 2019 to test whether radiotrophic fungi could be used as protection against radiation, especially in space. The experiment used Cladosporium sphaerospermum. Results were prepublished for peer-review in July 2020 .

It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1979. Description The house was one story, of brick with a steep gable roof, in Federal style including a fanlight over the front door. It was originally rectangular, measuring 26 by 28 feet; before 1919 a frame extension with shiplap siding was added at the rear to create a T shape, and this had a rear porch that was later filled in. The house was one of the last remaining buildings from the early history of Benicia, when the town served as the capital of California from 1853 to 1854, and the brick appears identical to that used to build the state capitol there. The front door and interior wood trim appeared to be later 19th-century additions from lumberyard stock, and wooden millwork decoration was of a style suggesting the 1870s; the house itself had also been thought to date to that decade, because of a 1919 city assessment estimating its age as 40 years. There was a brick cistern under part of the building, and the house had an attic and basement and appeared to have been originally heated by stoves vented into a chimney between rooms. History The Carr House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1979, at which time there were plans to restore it. It was demolished by the turn of the millennium.

The election saw Gordon Wilson become the party's new national convenor. William Wolfe had been the leader of the SNP since winning a leadership election in 1969, and initially the party had performed well under his leadership. In 1978, he announced that he intended to stand down the following year and, as a result, he had little involvement with the party's campaign in the 1979 United Kingdom general election. The election went very badly for the SNP, which lost nine of its eleven seats in Parliament. Immediately after the election, a group of left-wingers in the party, including Roseanna Cunningham and Margo MacDonald, formed what became the 79 Group.David Torrance, \\"SNP fall-out that saw Salmond expelled but put party on new path\\", The Scotsman, 19 March 2009. In response, those who wished to prioritise independence over all other considerations formed the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, \\"Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations\\", Pinter, London, 2000, p. 388. Both groups put forward candidates for election to various posts in the election held at that year's conference, held in Dundee.Peter Lynch, \\"SNP - The History of the Scottish National Party\\" (Welsh Academic Press, 2002), p. 170. The most significant election at the conference was that for party leader. Three candidates stood to replace Wolfe: * Stephen Maxwell, Vice Chair (Publicity), chair of the unsuccessful SNP campaign in the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, and a leading figure in the 79 Group. * Willie McRae, Vice Chair (Administration), solicitor and unsuccessful SNP candidate for Ross and Cromarty in the general election. * Gordon Wilson, Member of Parliament for Dundee East, former leader of the SNP Parliamentary group and spokesperson on oil and energy. Wilson easily won the election, with 530 votes. Maxwell took 117 votes, and MacRae only 52. The 79 Group failed to win any of the elections at the conference.

History  The initial impulse to write the Concerto came when Pierre Boulez wrote to Barraqu√© asking for a new work for the Domaine Musical‚Äôs 1962‚Äì63 season. Barraqu√© wrote back, suggesting the Concerto, and he began composing it on Easter Monday, 23 April 1962. He did not finish it at that time, however. He resumed work in the summer of 1968 in Perros-Guirec, and completed the score in Florence on 22 October of the same year. It was premiered on 20 November 1968 at the Royal Festival Hall in London, by Hubert Rostaing (clarinet), Tristan Fry (vibraphone), and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gilbert Amy. The manuscript score was dedicated on 20 March 1969 to Claude and Hubert Rostaing (; ; ).  Instrumentation  There are two solo instruments, clarinet and vibraphone, accompanied by six instrumental formations, each containing one stringed instrument, one woodwind, and one brass : # Violin, bassoon, trumpet # Viola, cor anglais, trombone # Cello, alto flute, tenor saxophone # Harp, bass clarinet, baritone saxophone # Amplified harpsichord, oboe, horn # Amplified guitar, flute, alto saxophone  Character  The manuscript title page includes several mottos and inscriptions indicating the formal character and intended poetic atmosphere. One of these is an abbreviated form of the ‚ÄúAffranchi du hasard‚Äù quotation found in the printed score of ‚Äò‚Äô‚Ä¶ au del√† du hasard‚Äô‚Äô: ‚Äúthe many currents cross / ‚Ä¶ towards one convergent point / united among themselves they are the mirrors‚Äù. One of the others indicate Schubert as a spiritual influence: ‚Äúbecause of a smile, for a sadness, for a very gentle memory towards Schubert‚Äù .  Structure  The Concerto consists of seventeen sequences grouped in six sections, which are played without interruption . Its scoring resembles that of Pierre Boulez‚Äôs Domaines, which was begun in 1961 and premiered in the same year as the Concerto, but while Boulez keeps his six instrumental groups as distinct as possible, Barraqu√©‚Äôs flow together into an orchestra. Boulez also projects a regular series of twelve alternations between his soloist and each instrumental group, whereas Barraqu√©‚Äôs work is continuous .

History  The guard of the WPRA 1st Soviet Higher Military School All-Russian Central Executive Committee at Lenin Mausoleum in 1924. The school was formed in December 15, 1917 (O.S., December 28 N.S.), by order of Vladimir Lenin as the 1st Moscow revolutionary machine gun officers school. It later became the 1st Moscow Machine Gunners' Officers Course and \\"WPRA 1st Soviet Higher Military School All-Russian Central Executive Committee\\". In 1938 it received the first of its three order medals, the Order of the Red Banner, as a result of its Corps of Cadets and some alumni of the school who fought the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. During the Second World War, on the Eastern Front, cadets and faculty at the school contributed to the defense of the Moscow Region and the city itself. Many of its cadets and alumni later received state medals and decorations (several were awarded posthumously). In October 1941, the school was granted the honorary title \\"Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR\\". In October 1945, five months after the Allied victory in Europe and the command school's participation in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945, it was moved to Kuzminki District in Moscow. This is its current location. In June 1958 the school was transformed into the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School. The school had a training period of four years. On May 7, 1965, the school was awarded the Order of Lenin. On February 21, 1978, the school was awarded the Order of the October Revolution. In 1995, the 4-year training period was lengthened to one of 5 years. In August 2004, the university was renamed as the Higher Professional Education Institution of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (and was retitled the Moscow Military Command Training School). In 2010, the school was integrated into the Combined Arms Academy of the Russian Armed Forces. In 2017, the Military Institute was removed from the Combined Arms Academy and was renamed again as the Moscow Higher Military Command School (Combined Arms). To mark its centennial year in 2017, the MHMCACS was awarded the Order of Zhukov. In January 1919 after a year of operations, the Red Army took over the school administration. The headquarters and campus were then at the Moscow Kremlin. During that period, in 1922 Vladimir Lenin was awarded as the young institution's first honorary cadet; he was later made its only honorary commandant. The Kremlin was its campus until 1935, when the school was moved to Moscow's Lefortovo District. At the Kremlin, the space was used by the Kremlin Regiment, now the President of Russia's escort and historical regiment. Mikhail Frunze told the cadets during a 1918 visit that the 1st SMHS and its Corps of Cadets \\"serves as the fighting vanguard and unfading hope of the proletariat revolution in the Russian Republic\\". Alumni of the school have served with the Soviet Army and the Russian Ground Forces in many local and international deployments. Traditions The school's cadets are also known as the Kremlin Cadets or the Kremlovtsy. In honor of its 1917 establishment and status as the oldest officer cadet school in Russia, since 1967 it has been the final school and military unit to mark the end of military parades in Moscow's Red Square. During the Moscow Victory Day Parade, members of the school also take part in the historical part.https://iz.ru/1026779/aleksei- ramm-anton-lavrov-bogdan-stepovoi-roman-kretcul/v-paradnom-poriadke-kak- proidut-kolonny-po-krasnoi-ploshchadi-24-iiunia It also maintains privilege, granted in the 1920s, to hold graduation and commissioning parades there. From 1924 to 1935, the Corps of Cadets mounted guards of honour (No.1 Sentry) at Lenin's Mausoleum by orders of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. In addition to Lenin, individuals honored as honorary cadets by the school were Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Frunze, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikolai Podvoisky, Sergey Kamenev, Avel Yenukidze, Georgy Chicherin, David Petrovsky, and Iona Yakir.

The figure shows the global key-route main paths (in red) for a sample citation network (based on search path count and at key-route 1). Main path analysis is a mathematical tool, first proposed by Hummon and Doreian in 1989, to identify the major paths in a citation network, which is one form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The method begins by measuring the significance of all the links in a citation network through the concept of ‚Äòtraversal count‚Äô and then sequentially chains the most significant links into a \\"main path\\", which is deemed the most significant historical path in the target citation network. The method is applicable to any human activity that can be organized in the form of a citation network. The method is commonly applied to trace the knowledge flow paths or development trajectories of a science or technology field, through bibliographic citations or patent citations. It has also been applied to judicial decisions to trace the evolving changes of legal opinions. Main path analysis has attracted scholars attention recently. Academic research related to main path analysis saw a fast growing since 2007. A list of academic articles that introduce, explain, apply, modify, or extend the method originated in Hummon and Doreian can be found here.  History  Main path analysis is first proposed in Hummon and Doreian (1989) in which they suggest a different approach for analyzing a citation network \\"where the connective threads through a network are preserved and the focus is on the links in the network rather than on the nodes.\\" They call the resulting chain of the most used citation links \\"main path\\" and claim that \\"It is our intuition that the main path, selected on the basis of the most used path will identify the main stream of a literature.\\" The idea was verified using a set of DNA research articles. To make the method more practical, Liu and Lu (2012) extends the method to include the key-route search. The most useful feature of the key-route search is that one is able to view the different level of main paths by adjusting the key-route numbers.  The method  Main path analysis operates in two steps. The first step obtains the traversal counts of each link in a citation network. Several types of traversal counts are mentioned in the literature. The second step searches for the main paths by linking the significant links according to the size of traversal counts. One needs to prepare a citation network before proceeding for main path analysis. = Preparing a citation network = It is necessary to prepare a citation network before starting main path analysis. In a citation network, the nodes represent the documents such as academic articles, patents, or legal cases. These nodes are connected using citation information. Citation networks are by nature directed because the two nodes on the opposite end of a link are not symmetrical in their roles. As regards to the direction, this article adopts the convention that the cited node points to the citing node, signifying the fact that knowledge in the cited node flows to the citing node. Citation network is also by nature acyclic, which means that a node can never chain back to itself if one moves along the links following their direction. Several terms related to a citation network are defined here before proceeding further. Heads are the nodes the direction arrow leads to. Tails are the nodes on other ends of the direction arrow. Sources are the nodes that are cited but cite no others. Sinks cite other nodes but are not cited. Ancestors are the nodes that can be traced back to from a target node. Descendants are the nodes that one can reach from a target if one moves along the links following their direction. Figure 1. SPC values for a sample citation network = Traversal counts = Traversal counts measure the significance of a link. The literature discusses several types of traversal counts, including search path count (SPC), search path link count (SPLC), search path node pair (SPNP), and other variations. All these traversal counts will be noted as SPX. Figure 2. SPLC values for a sample citation network  Search path count (SPC)  A link‚Äôs SPC is the number of times the link is traversed if one runs through all possible paths from all the sources to all the sinks. SPC is first proposed by Vladimir Batagelj.Batagelj, V. (2003). Efficient algorithms for citation network analysis. arXiv preprint cs/0309023. SPC values for each link in a sample citation network is shown in Figure 1. The SPC value for the link (B, D) is 5 because five paths (B-D-F-H-K, B-D-F- I-L, B-D-F-I-M-N, B-D-I-L, and B-D-I-M-N) traverse through it. Figure 3. SPNP values for a sample citation network  Search path link count (SPLC)  A link‚Äôs SPLC is the number of times the link is traversed if one runs through all possible paths from all the ancestors of the tail node (including itself) to all the sinks. SPLC is first proposed by Hummon and Doreian. Figure 2 presents the SPLC values for each link in the same citation network as shown in Figure 1. Six paths traverse through the link (D, F) thus give it the SPLC value 6. They are: B-D-F-H-K, B-D-F-I-L, B-D-F-I-M-N, D-F-H-K, D-F-I-L, and D-F-I-M-N, noting that all the paths begin either from the ancestor of D, which is B, and D itself.  Search path node pair (SPNP)  A link‚Äôs SPNP is the number of times the link is traversed if one runs through all possible paths from all the ancestors of the tail node (including itself) to all the descendants of the head node (including itself). SPNP is first proposed by Hummon and Doreian. The SPNP values of the link (C, H) is 6 because there are 6 paths that begin from A, B, C (A and B are C's ancestors) and end at H and K (K is H's descendant). These paths are A-C-H, A-C-H-K, B-C-H, B-C-H-K, C-H, and C-H-K. Figure 4. Local main paths in a sample citation network = Path search = Based on the traversal counts, one can then search for the most significant path(s). There are several ways of finding them, including local, global, and key-route search. Figure 5. Global main paths in a sample citation network  Local search  Local search is mentioned in Hummon and Doreian as \\"priority first\\" search. This search process always chooses the next link(s) with the highest SPX as the outgoing link. It keeps tracking the most traversed link(s) thus obtains the main stream among all citation chains. Figure 4 shows the local main paths that are obtained based on SPC. Noticing that when the search reaches the node I, two outgoing links have the same SPC values thus producing two paths afterward. Figure 6. Local key-route main paths in a sample citation network  Global search  Global search simply suggests the citation chain with the largest overall SPX. The concept of global search is similar to the critical path method in project scheduling. The global main paths of the sample citation network based on SPC is presented in Figure 5. The sum of all the SPC values in the path B-D-F-I-M-N is 15, which is the largest among all possible paths. Figure 7. Global key-route main paths in a sample citation network  Key-route search  Key-route search is designed to avoid the problem of missing significant links in both the local and global search. The problem is in the local and global main paths shown above, in which one of the most important links (H, K) is not included in the main paths. As described in Liu and Lu (2012), the approach searches main paths from the specified links (key-routes) thus guarantees the inclusion of the links. One can also specify multiple links to obtain multiple main paths. An additional advantage of the key-route approach is that one is able to control the detail of the main paths by varying the number of key-routes. The larger the number of key-route is specified, the more detail is revealed. When the number of key-route increases to a certain point the search returns the whole citation network. Figure 6 and 7 show the local key-route and global key-route main paths of the sample citation network. In both main paths the number of key-route is set to 1, i.e., doing the search base on only the top links. Since there are two top links (B, D) and (H, K), the resulting main paths include both of them.  The Variants  In addition to the key-route search approach, variations of the method include the approach that is aggregative and stochastic, considers decay in knowledge diffusion, etc.  Applications  The method has been applied to three types of documenting system that maintain the tradition of making references to the previous documents. They are the academic article, patent, and judicial documenting system. = Academic article = Academic citation databases such as Web of Science and Scopus include comprehensive digitized citation information. These information make it possible to apply main path analysis to examine the knowledge structure or trace the knowledge flow of any scientific fields. Some early applications explores the subject of centrality-productivity, conflict resolution, etc. More recent applications include fullerenes, nanotubes, data envelopment analysis, supply chain management, corporate social responsibility, IT outsourcing, medical tourism, etc. = Patent = Patents referencing prior arts is a common practice. For example, each United States patent document includes a \\"References Cited\\" section that lists the prior arts of the patent. Patent databases such as Clarivate Analytics and Webpat provide digitized patent citation information. Verspagen (2007) and Mina (2007) are the two early works that apply main path analysis to the patent data. = Judicial document = In the common law system, a court decision document usually references previously published opinions for the purpose of justifying the current decision. These judicial references, or legal citations, can also be used to construct citation networks and then tracing the changes of legal opinions. Research opportunity in this area is wide open. Liu et al. (2014) conducted an exploratory study on such type of application.  Software Implementation  Main path analysis is implemented in Pajek, a widely used social network analysis software written by Vladimir Batagelj and Andrej Mrvar of University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. To run main path analysis in Pajek, one needs to first prepare a citation network and have Pajek reads in the network. Next, in the Pajek main menu, computes the traversal counts of all links in the network applying one of the following command sequences (depending on the choice of traversal counts). Network ‚Üí Acyclic Network ‚Üí Create Weighted Network + Vector ‚Üí Traversal Weights ‚Üí Search Path Link Count (SPC), or Network ‚Üí Acyclic Network ‚Üí Create Weighted Network + Vector ‚Üí Traversal Weights ‚Üí Search Path Link Count (SPLC), or Network ‚Üí Acyclic Network ‚Üí Create Weighted Network + Vector ‚Üí Traversal Weights ‚Üí Search Path Node Pairs (SPNP) After traversal counts are computed, the following command sequences find the main paths.

It was released on February 22, 2000 by Smithsonian Folkways. The album consists of traditional folk, blues, and spiritual songs featuring Broonzy accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and a guest appearance by Pete Seeger. Suffering from cancer, Broonzy realized his time was limited and hence recorded extensively between 1956 and 1957. While most of the work draws from the album Big Bill Broonzy Sings Country Blues (1957), arranged by Moses Asch and Charles Edward Smith, Trouble in Mind is also sourced from concert broadcasts and interviews recorded late in Broonzy's career. Like other albums issued by Smithsonian Folkways, Trouble in Mind has been kept in print; the production quality of the album is higher than most installments of the label's catalogue. An accompanying booklet, arranged by Jeff Place and Anthony Seeger, includes photos and notes documenting Broonzy's stint with Folkways. While Trouble in Mind only represents the latter portion of Broonzy's career, music critics have recognized the album for its historically significant material.  Background and recording  An extensively recorded bluesman, Big Bill Broonzy left the United States to tour Europe in 1951, becoming the first Chicago blues player to perform for European audiences. Broonzy previously spent time in Iowa, where he honed a repertoire which remained a fixture of his concerts and recordings for the remainder of the decade. With bluesmen such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf amplifying their music, resulting in the popularity of the electric blues, Broonzy decided to reinvent himself as a folk blues musician to capitalize on another prevailing trend, the folk revival. Folkways Records producer Moses Asch and New York-based jazz critic Charles Edward Smith took an interest to Broonzy's folk material. Ashe envisioned recording Broonzy in a style reminiscent of his 1930s records: as a solo performer accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. According to musicologist Jeff Place, Broonzy's stripped-down approach brought his singing and lyrics to the forefront. Although fusing folk with blues influences was common during the folk revival, particularly with Lead Belly and Josh White, Broonzy was arguably the most chronicled bluesman of the era. Asch and Smith had partaken in several projects with Broonzy, including albums and interviews, before he was forced to retire from music in early 1957, due to complications from throat cancer.  Music  Trouble in Mind is largely culled from a recording session in New York produced by Asche and Smith; originally, Folkways released the studio work on the album Bill Broonzy Sings the Country Blues in 1957. The final two tracks were taped during a concert at Northwestern University. Spoken introductions and commentary were spliced together from interviews conducted by DJ Studs Terkel on the radio station WFMT. Aside from Pete Seeger on banjo for a live rendition of \\"This Train (Bound for Glory)\\", all the instrumentation is credited to Broonzy. The majority of the original songs were written by Broonzy, who was also credited as musical arranger on some covers. On \\"Key to the Highway\\", he collaborated with piano player Charlie Segar, creating the melody while Sagar wrote most of the lyrics. Broonzy's willingness to address sensitive political issues are especially evident on \\"Joe Turner No. 2\\", \\"When Will I Get to Be Called Man\\", and \\"Black, Brown, and White Blues\\", topical songs that other record labels refused to release. Included on Trouble in Mind are renditions of traditional folk and blues compositions such as \\"Frankie and Johnny\\", \\"When Things Go Wrong (It Hurts Me Too)\\", and \\"C.C. Rider\\". These tracks, frequently played by Broonzy live, ensured that his albums would have instant appeal for white audiences in the manner of various country blues-based LPs that had resulted from the rediscovery of old-time blues artists.  Release and reception  Smithsonian Folkways released Trouble in Mind on February 22, 2000; the label keeps the album in print. The album's liner notes were supplied by musicologist Jeff Place, who wrote detailed Broonzy's career and the songs complied on the album. Considering Trouble in Mind compiles recordings produced in the 1950s, the album is enhanced by higher sound quality, more so than most Smithsonian Folkways releases. In his review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger said of Trouble in Mind: \\"[Broonzy] was likely not in peak physical shape by this time, you wouldn't suspect that from the quality of the performances. His vocals are still rich and moving on a relaxed selection of originals and standards\\". PopMatters' reviewer Patrick Jones found the presentation of the album is encouraging \\"the listener to interact with the music, to learn about it, and to explore its link to history\\", and \\"is a rewarding and culturally enriching experience\\". Criticism from No Depression noted the novelty of Broonzy's Folkways material as a part of the vogue for \\"country-turned-urban blues singers as facsimiles of some idealized rural past\\"; however, it commended the historical significance of the album.

During World War I the U.S. government moved strongly against the IWW. On September 5, 1917, U.S. Department of Justice agents made simultaneous raids on dozens of IWW meeting halls across the country.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: A History of the IWW.

Minutes books, correspondence, mailing lists, and publications were seized, with the U.S. Department of Justice removing five tons of material from the IWW's General Office in Chicago alone. This seized material was scoured for possible violations of the Espionage Act of 1917 and other laws, with a view to future prosecution of the organization's leaders, organizers, and key activists. Based largely on documents seized on September 5, a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago indicted 166 IWW leaders for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new Espionage Act.Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 407. 101 went on trial en masse before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, which began on April 1, 1918.

During the trial, Vanderveer is reputed to have said: > The IWWs say there must be a fundamental change and that fundamental change > must be in the reorganization of industry, for public service, so that the > purpose shall be that we will work to live and not merely live to work.

Rosen about Jewish citizens of the Confederate States of America who served in the Confederate States Army (CSA) during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865. As they made up just 0.2% of the CSA, their story had not been heavily researched before Rosen, a Jewish lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina with a master's degree in History from Harvard University, authored the book. It received both praise and criticism in many academic journals. Rosen has written two more books about the city of Charleston. Summary Rosen gives an overview of Jewish participation in the Confederate States Army (CSA) during the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, and their attachment to the extant Confederate States of America. Even though Jews were only 2,000 out of 1 million members of the CSA, Rosen shows that both Sephardi Jews, who had been in the South for a long time, and Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom were immigrants from Prussia, joined the Confederacy alongside their neighbors and served honorably. While the book mentions well-known Jewish Confederates such as Judah P. Benjamin, Moses Ezekiel, David Levy Yulee, Abraham Myers and Phoebe Pember, and lesser known Jewish Confederates like Henry M. Hyams, Benjamin F. Jonas, Adolph Proskauer and Alexander Hart, it is also full of vignettes about the lives of ordinary Southern Jewish families who sent their sons to the war front, as well as their daughters and mothers, who often acted as Confederate informants. Critical reception In the Journal of Southern History, Leonard Dinnerstein, a professor of history at the University of Arizona, praised the book for its academic rigor. Similarly, in a review for the South Carolina Historical Magazine, Gordon C. Rhea called the book \\"a thoughtful and readable narrative packed with information and insights\\" as well as \\"a fine piece of scholarship and a fascinating read.\\" Reviewing it for Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, Sheldon S. Cohen praised it as \\"an engaging and expansive portrayal of a small, yet singular, group of Americans and their involvement in one of this nation's most determinative and monumental conflicts.\\" In the Georgia Historical Quarterly, Mark K. Bauman of the Atlanta Metropolitan College praised the book as \\"a carefully documented, nuanced study based on numerous primary sources that is grounded in the appropriate historical literature.\\" In a review for The New York Times, Roy Hoffman called the book \\"comprehensive and readerly\\" but he stressed that it was \\"sometimes inconsistent as social analysis.\\" Similarly, in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Frederic Krome of The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives, called the book \\"well-written and organized\\" but \\"not very analytical.\\" In particular, he criticized Rosen's effort to \\"downplay\\" Southern anti-Semitism. Reviewing it for Shofar, Robert E. May, a professor of history at Purdue University, highlighted Rosen's contention that Jews were better accepted in the South than the North both in the Antebellum era and during the war. He concluded by calling the book \\"a truly invaluable contribution to American Jewish historiography.\\" In Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, David T. Gleeson, a professor of history at Northumbria University, criticized Rosen for failing to delve into the differences between anti-Semitism in the North and the South. Nevertheless, he praised the book for filling \\"a major gap in the historiography of the Confederacy.\\" Robert A. Taylor, a professor of History at Florida International University, praised the book as \\"a significant contribution to the literature of the Civil War South and American Jewish history.\\" He also noted that the Jewish culture of the Antebellum South was mostly gone after the war, as new Jewish immigrants distanced themselves from it. Meanwhile, in American Jewish History, Jonathan D. Sarna, the Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University, dismissed the book as \\"an apologia, a pious bow to the 'religious of the lost cause'.\\" Specifically, he criticized the chapters about the Reconstruction Era on the grounds that Rosen's \\"sources are meager and his one-sidedness embarrassing.\\" He concluded by reiterating that the book \\"does justice to one side of the conflict alone.\\" Rosen anticipated this negative reaction from modern Jews, writing in the preface \\"Modern-day Jews are very uncomfortable with the notion that antebellum Southern Jews owned slaves and that a few were in the business of slave trading. After all, Jews are unique among people in telling the story of their own enslavement ... Jewish Americans are understandably ill at ease\\" with this fact. According to Rosen's analysis, his evidence proves that few Jews owned slaves and that a sense of duty to the place one lived and defending one's home and to counter anti- Semitic stereotypes played large roles in their support for the Confederacy.Rosen, passim, especially pp. xii-xiii, 13-14 47-54. \\"Many Jewish historians, reflecting their own beliefs and preconceived notions and reading history from the present to the past, cannot bring themselves to believe that Jews voluntarily fought for the Confederacy,\\" observed Rosen.Rosen, p. 379 n. 5 They refuse to accept proven historical facts such as General Ulysses S. Grant's General Order No. 11, expelling the Jews from the areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky under his control (\\"which was not an isolated event\\") and Lee's written response to a captain turning down a Jewish soldier's request for religious leave that he (the officer) \\"should always respect the religious views and feelings of others\\" signify that their beliefs are incorrect and need to be set aside and further research in the original sources conducted. Rosen noted that Lincoln's revocation of Grant's order does nothing to erase the fact that it was issued in the first place and that General Order No. 11 \\"would never have been issued by Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis.\\"Rosen, pp. xii, 265, 431-432 nn. 125, 126. The same Jonathan D. Sarna who authored the negative review of The Jewish Confederates wrote a book entitled When General Grant Expelled the Jews which attempted to defend Grant and take the sting out of the anti-Semitism charge against him. It was published in 2012. Historian Bertram Korn noted a similar reaction with his historically-accurate observation that in the matter of Jewish chaplains for the military the Confederate Congress was more \\"liberal and tolerant\\" than that of the North. The U. S. Congress only allowed non-Christian chaplains to minister to the spiritual need of Union troops after intense lobbying from Jewish groups. From the start, the Confederacy welcomed all chaplains in their army. Despite having \\"caused a few eyebrows to be raised fairly high,\\" Korn stood by his initial assertion.Rosen, pp. 209, 425 n. 136.

It reimagines Sophocles's play Antigone unfolding among British Muslims. The novel follows the Pasha family: twin siblings Aneeka and Parvaiz and their older sister Isma, who has raised them in the seven years since the siblings were orphaned by the death of their mother; their jihadi father, whom the twins never knew, is also dead. Parvaiz attempts to follow in his father's footsteps by joining ISIS in Syria, but when he decides he has made a serious mistake, his twin sister attempts to help him return to Britain, in part through her romantic relationship with Eamonn Lone. Eammon is the son of British Home Secretary Karamat Lone, who has built his political career on his rejection of his own Muslim background. The effort to bring Parvaiz home fails: Parvaiz is shot to death trying to escape, then Eamonn and Aneeka, trying to return Parvaiz's body to the UK over the objections of Karamat Lone, die in a terrorist attack. Home Fire won the Women's Prize for Fiction 2018,Flood, Alison (6 June 2018), \\"Kamila Shamsie wins Women's prize for fiction for 'story of our times'\\", The Guardian.Associated press (6 June 2018), \\"Kamila Shamsie's 'Home Fire' wins Women's Prize for Fiction\\", The Washington Times. and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2017 and shortlisted for the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2018. The concerns of the novel include the identity and security of Muslims in Britain. It speaks of the troubles of Muslims as they struggle to maintain a unique cultural identity while defending their Britishness and loyalty to the state against political and social activists who wish to alienate them. Development and publication history Shamsie began Home Fire at the suggestion of London theatre director Jatinder Verma that Shamsie write a modern update of Antigone, by Sophocles. Shamsie was interested in the project and quickly decided on what the story she would tell, though she preferred to pursue it as a novel rather than a play. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, she described her writing process: > When I read the play‚Äîwhich has at its center two sisters who respond > differently to the legal repercussions of their brother's act of treason‚ÄîI > knew immediately that I wanted to connect it to a story that was very much > in the news at the time, that of young British Muslims and their > relationship with the British state...When you write a novel you don't think > about subjects as being sensitive or not‚Äîyou just think of them as being > interesting and complex, and you wonder how to tell them in a story that's > about a group of characters. The book's epigraph quotes from Seamus Heaney's translation of Antigone: \\"The ones we love ... are enemies of the state.\\" The 288-page novel was published on 15 August 2017, by Riverhead Books. It was serialised for BBC Radio 4 in April 2019. Synopsis The novel begins with Isma Pasha detained in security at Heathrow airport. A 28-year-old Muslim hijabi woman who has been raising her younger, twin siblings since their mother's death when the twins were 12, their reaching adulthood (now 19) has allowed Isma to pursue her long-deferred graduate studies, doing so in Massachusetts at the invitation of her former tutor at LSE, Hira Shah. Prolonged interrogation in security causes Isma to miss her flight from London to Boston, but she eventually makes her way to Amherst, Massachusetts where she settles into a routine, spending mornings in a cafe working and keeping an eye on Skype, where she sees both her younger siblings' names appear briefly each day. Isma is in contact with Aneeka, but Aneeka's twin brother Parvaiz is a source of conflict between them. At the cafe one morning, Isma spots a young man, Eamonn Lone, the son of British politician Karamat Lone, for whom Isma has a fierce dislike. Nevertheless, she strikes up a friendship with 24-year-old Eamonn, not acknowledging she is aware of his father, and soon Eamonn is joining her daily at the cafe. He is in Massachusetts staying with his white, American mother's relatives and living off family money while taking a year off from work, contrasting sharply with Isma's own modest circumstances; she worked at a drycleaner to support her younger siblings when they were orphaned. Meanwhile in Britain, Eamonn's father is made Home Secretary, prompting Eamonn to discover Isma both knows and sharply dislikes his father. Offended, Eamonn abruptly leaves. Isma is very hurt but Hira advises her to open up to Eamonn, as Isma clearly has feelings for him. Isma is initially reluctant but in the meantime she receives a distraught call from Aneeka, who demands to know why Isma had informed on Parvaiz to the police. Aneeka says that its Isma's fault Parvaiz can't come back. She cuts off contact with Isma, who is devastated and texts Eamonn asking to meet. She greets him without her hijab for the first time and tells him the story of her father, who was absent much of her life (and the entire lives of her young siblings), fighting as a jihadi in various conflicts. Her father was captured and held at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan before dying in transport to Guantanamo Bay. After his death, Isma's family had sought help from the local MP to learn the details of his fate--they don't know where or even if he was buried--but the MP had brusquely turned them away, declaring the family was better off without him. This MP was Karamat Lone, Eamonn's father. Eamonn is pained to learn this, though he tries to defend his father. They reconcile, partially, though Isma is wounded when he refers to his relationship to her as like a \\"brother\\" and she makes an excuse not to see him again before he ends his sojourn in the U.S. and returns to London. But seeing photographs of her siblings as well as a pack of M&M;'s she has wrapped to send to her aunt, he insists on carrying the candy back to mail for her in London. When he leaves, Isma breaks down in tears, heartbroken that he does not reciprocate her romantic interest. Back in London, Eamonn treks to Isma's aunt's house in Preston Road in Wembley--the neighborhood where his own father's family had lived--to deliver the M&M;'s in person. He encounters Aneeka, who is very cold to Eamonn, though when they meet a little while later on the Tube, she invites herself to his apartment and the two of them begin a romantic relationship. Eamonn finds himself falling for Aneeka and though they grow close, Aneeka insists on secrecy around their relationship, not even giving Eamonn her phone number; she tells him this is a sexual fantasy but he does overhear her once on a furtive phone call saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making sure of things here.‚Äù The secrecy stresses their relationship but they reconcile and grow closer, with Eamonn giving her a set of keys to his apartment and ultimately proposing to her. Eventually, Aneeka confesses that her brother-- who she had previously described vaguely as traveling to see the world--has in fact gone to Syria to join ISIS. Aneeka says he wants to come home but that as Home Secretary, Eamonn's father has made it very difficult. Eamonn realizes Aneeka is using him to seek assistance for her brother and is furious. However, Aneeka insists that she has fallen for him and the two make up. Eamonn goes to talk to his father about Parvaiz. But Karamat Lone absolutely refuses to help and forbids Eamonn from any further contact with Aneeka. Moving back in time to just prior to Isma's departure, Parvaiz is working at a grocery and pursuing his interest in sound engineering; while a scholarship allows Aneeka to attend university, he cannot afford tuition. The twins spend more and more time apart, and Parvaiz encounters Farooq, whose father had fought in Bosnia with Parvaiz's father. Farooq encourages Parvaiz to learn about what happened to his father at Bagram; he is also sharply critical of the matriarchal family in which Parvaiz grew up, as well as of the British austerity measures that affect Parvaiz's life as well. He persuades Parvaiz that the ISIS Caliphate in Syria has remedied all this, showing him photos of his own time there. With Farooq's assurances that Parvaiz would be allowed to leave at any time if he wished, and also that Farooq would introduce him to others who had fought with Parvaiz's father, Parvaiz makes arrangements to visit family in Pakistan, but skips his connecting flight in Istanbul and instead travels with Farooq to the Syrian border to join ISIS. While the house they arrive at is beautiful, the rest of Farooq's promises immediately prove empty--Parvaiz's passport is confiscated on arrival and Farooq departs for the battlefront without helping him locate anyone who knew his father, leaving Parvaiz behind in Raqqa. He receives a panicked call from his sisters, who know he has missed his flight and are being interrogated by police in London, cementing Parvaiz's regret for his decision, but he is trapped. He works for the media wing of ISIS until his twin calls a few months later saying she is making a plan to help him escape, promising a new passport for him. A trip to Istanbul with Farooq to collect new recruits and audiovisual equipment provides Parvaiz an opportunity to meet Aneeka and make his escape. But Aneeka is stopped at the airport in London and, as Farooq has discovered Parvaiz has tried to escape and is now determined to find and kill him, Parvaiz decides to put himself at the mercy of the British consulate, though his father had died in the custody of British allies. But the question is moot: Parvaiz is killed in a drive-by shooting as he approaches the building. A media frenzy around the Istanbul shooting of the British-born jihadi ensues. Karamat Lone, who has ordered an investigation, publicly discloses that Parvaiz's sister, Aneeka, had seduced his own son in an (unsuccessful) attempt to win special consideration for her terrorist brother. Additionally, as Karamat Lone's policies as Home Secretary had denaturalized Parvaiz, the UK refuses to repatriate his body and sends it to relatives in Pakistan instead. Karamat's denunciations of the Pasha family draw praise in Parliament but Aneeka is outraged and travels to Pakistan to insist that her brother be returned to the UK for burial, setting up camp in a public park with his body. Eamonn, who has been sent to a family friend's home in Normandy, returns to the public eye with the release of a video denouncing his father for preventing Aneeka from burying her brother in the UK. He then departs Normandy to join her, still keeping a vigil with her brother's body in Karachi. In London, reports of terrorist \\"chatter\\" sends Karamat Lone and his wife and daughter in a safe room. They soon receive the all clear, informed the chatter had been a hoax, but as they depart the safe room, they learn this is mistaken: there was a threat, but for Eamonn. Attacked as he arrived in the Karachi park in search of Aneeka, two men strap Eamonn into a belt loaded with explosives. The gathered crowds flee as Eamonn struggles in vain to free himself and he screams at Aneeka to run away, but she runs toward him. For a final few seconds, they embrace.  Style  Akin to a play's five acts, the book is in five sections, each focusing on a different character's point of view, told in free indirect discourse. The novel is also set in five locations: London; Amherst, Massachusetts; Istanbul; Raqqa, Syria; and Karachi, Pakistan.  Themes  Home Fire is a contemporary reimagining of the Greek tragedy Antigone and New York Times book critic Dwight Garner argued the novel \\"hews to [the original's] themes: civil disobedience, fidelity and the law, especially as regards burial rights.\\" The main themes include sacrifice, loyalty, and identity. Isma is the embodiment of sacrifice who discontinues her higher education to earn a living for her family consisting of a brother and a sister. Her frugality helps her family survive difficult times. Through Aneeka, the author talks of a sister, who must defy her state to fight for her brother Parvaiz's return after he joins ISIS. Karamat Lone leaves behind his Muslim identity to appeal to the wider British audience as he climbs the ladder of success in politics. Reception The novel received widely favorable reviews. In The Guardian, Natalie Haynes said, \\"Shamsie‚Äôs prose is, as always, elegant and evocative. Home Fire pulls off a fine balancing act: it is a powerful exploration of the clash between society, family and faith in the modern world, while tipping its hat to the same dilemma in the ancient one.\\" In The Washington Post, Katharine Weber said the novel \\"blazes with the kind of annihilating devastation that transcends grief.\\" Garner said the novel \\"may seem to wobble\\" in middle portions, \\"lurching shifts of tone as it moves between matters of the heart and of state,\\" but strongly encouraged readers to stick Home Fire, as \\"builds to one of the most memorable final scenes I've read in a novel this century.\\" Home Fire was longlisted as a candidate for the 2017 Man Booker Prize, shortlisted for the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2018 and won the 2018 Women's Prize for Fiction\\"Announcing the 2018 Women‚Äôs Prize winner!\\" Women's Prize for Fiction\\"Women's Prize for Fiction: Kamila Shamsie wins 2018 award for Home Fire\\", BBC News, 6 June 2018.Hedges- Stocks, Zoah (6 June 2018), \\"Women's Prize for Fiction 2018: Kamila Shamsie wins with Home Fire\\", The Telegraph.\\"British Pakistani author Kamila Shamsie wins UK's most prestigious literary award for women\\", The Express Tribune, 7 June 2018.

Modeling methodology The 3D modeling process used is that of polygon modeling with triangular faces to be represented by shell models. Limited use of constructive solid geometry is possible though only as a transitional method to create the union, subtraction and intersection of shell models. Once created models are rendered on an HTML 5 canvas element using a shader program which determines the pixel positions and colors on the canvas using the polygon models, the textures applied to each model, the scene camera and lights together with the 4 x 4 world matrices for each object which stores their position, rotation and scale. The technique used to produce photo realistic images is that of physically based rendering along with post- processing methods. In order to simulate collisions between models and other real world physical actions one of two physics engines need to be added as plugins, these are Cannon.js and Oimo.

Gert originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 3 yet failed to organize significantly until August 12, when the system coalesced into a tropical depression east of the Bahamas. A few hours later, the depression became the seventh tropical storm of the annual hurricane season and was named Gert. For the next day, though, further intensification was hindered by the proximity of dry air. Once Gert was able to overcome that on August 14, however, Gert resumed strengthening while moving northwards, paralleling the United States coastline. Gert reached its peak intensity on August 16 at Category 2 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale as it accelerated northeastwards. Thereafter, increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused Gert to rapidly weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone on August 17, well east of Atlantic Canada. The remnants of Gert dissipated late on August 18, after they merged with another extratropical cyclone over the open Atlantic. During its lifetime, Gert brought heavy swells, rough surf, and rip currents to the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. Two fatalities occurred when two swimmers drowned amid heavy surf. The extratropical system that merged with the remnants of Gert went on to bring strong winds and rain to Ireland and parts of the United Kingdom. Meteorological history On August 2, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to track a tropical wave over western Africa. The wave emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on August 3, accompanied by a weak surface low-pressure area. While moving quickly westwards south of Cape Verde in a generally favorable environment characterized by high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and low vertical wind shear, the wave showed some signs of development, and was given a high chance of consolidating into a tropical depression during the next five days by the NHC. However, by August 5, the system's swift movement brought it into less favorable conditions, causing most of the wave's associated showers and thunderstorms to dissipate. The wave continued to track westwards over the next few days, eventually splitting into two systems‚Äîthe northern one being the precursor to Gert, and the southern portion later spawning Hurricane Kenneth in the Eastern Pacific. Afterwards, the precursor to Gert moved west-northwestwards, passing north of Puerto Rico on August 11. As it did so, convective bands associated with the system began to curve and concentrate towards the center of the system, evidencing increasing organization. A surface low-pressure area developed on August 12, and a tropical depression formed at 18:00 UTC that same day 265 miles (425 km) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The depression organized further to become a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on August 13, bearing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), and received the name Gert. Although conditions generally favored further intensification, with high SSTs and low wind shear, mid-level dry air disrupted Gert's central convection, causing Gert's intensity to hold steady for the next 18 hours. However, by August 14, Gert's circulation had mixed out the dry air, poising the storm for further strengthening. At that time, Gert was moving north-northwestwards to northwards through a gap in the subtropical ridge. Hurricane Gert off the United States East Coast on August 15 From August 14 onwards, Gert strengthened markedly, developing persistent deep convection and a central dense overcast. At 06:00 UTC on August 15, Gert became the second hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season as sustained winds rose to 75 mph (120 km/h). While an approaching mid-latitude trough began to accelerate Gert towards the northeast, Gert continued to intensify, developing an eye just across. At 18:00 UTC on August 16, Gert reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar (hPa; 28.41 inHg), ranked as Category 2 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Racing off to the east-northeast, Gert soon passed beyond the northern wall of the Gulf Stream, marking a significant decrease in SSTs. Compounded by increasing vertical wind shear and drier air, Gert began to weaken and its cloud pattern rapidly deteriorated; the system degraded to a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC on August 17\\\\. Six hours later, Gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 335 miles (535 km) southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland. The weakening cyclone continued northeast over the open Atlantic Ocean, before dissipating by 00:00 UTC on August 19. The remnant energy and moisture of the system merged with another extratropical cyclone to the northwest, which later went on to affect Ireland and the United Kingdom. Preparations and impact While Gert did not approach any land areas during its lifetime as a tropical cyclone, Gert still generated heavy swells, rough surf, and rip currents along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. At Nantucket, Massachusetts, several beaches were closed, and lifeguards conducted more than 25 water rescues on August 16 alone. Despite this, a 40-year-old man drowned off Nobadeer Beach around noon on August 16; attempts to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation after he was pulled from the water were not successful. In the Outer Banks off Cape Hatteras National Seashore, a 63-year-old man drowned on August 14 after being caught in a rip current during an attempt to rescue another swimmer \\"in distress\\". The other swimmer later returned safely to shore. The remnants of Gert merged with another extratropical cyclone that produced strong winds and heavy rain in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Ahead of the storm, Met √âireann issued yellow weather warnings for the entirety of Ireland, expecting heavy showers and localized flooding. As the storm hit, severe floods occurred in Northern Ireland, with floodwaters reaching . More than 100 people were rescued after being trapped in their cars or houses overnight.

Following three days of torrential rainfall, mass wasting of mud and debris damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in the city, killing 1,141 people and leaving more than 3,000 homeless. Causal factors for the mudslides include the region's particular topography and climate ‚Äì with Freetown's elevation close to sea level and its greater position within a tropical monsoon climate. Those factors were assisted by the generally poor state of the region's infrastructure and loss of protective natural drainage systems from periods of deforestation.  Background  The potential for deadly flooding in Sierra Leone was exacerbated by a combination of factors. Freetown, which sits at the tip of a peninsula, was in 2015 occupied by approximately 1million people. Freetown's topography alternates between thickly wooded and partially deforested mountains. These mountains run along the peninsula parallel to the Atlantic for 25 miles. Freetown's elevation varies from coastal areas which are at or just below sea level to approximately above sea level. Freetown suffers from long-term issues involving poor urban development programs. According to Jamie Hitchen of the Africa Research Institute \\"the government is failing to provide housing for the poorest in society\\", and when attention is paid to issues such as unregulated construction, it is received only after a crisis. Because a moratorium on housing construction was not enforced, unorganized settlements and municipal works encroached on flood plains, resulting in narrower water passageways. During floods, Freetown's drainage systems are often blocked by discarded waste, especially in the city's poorer communities, contributing to higher levels of surface runoff. The construction of large homes in hillside areas and unrestricted deforestation for residential purposes weakened the stability of nearby slopes and caused soil erosion. Within a decade leading up to the disaster, Sierra Leone cleared approximately 800,000 hectares of forest cover ‚Äì the country's civil war, fought between 1991 and 2002, was also a cause of deforestation. The nation's Environmental Protective Agency launched a reforesting mission in the region two weeks prior to the floods and mudslides, which was ultimately unsuccessful. Mudslides According to the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, Sierra Leone experienced a particularly wet rainy season, with the capital city of Freetown, in the Western Area of the country, experiencing 41 inches (104 cm) of rainfall from July 1, 2017, leading up to the mudslides ‚Äì nearly tripling the area's seasonal average. Sierra Leone's meteorological department did not warn residents to leave areas prone to flooding in time; from August 11 to 14, Freetown faced three consecutive days of rain, which led to severe flooding in the city and its surrounding suburbs. Flooding is an annual threat for the area: in 2015 floods killed 10 people and left thousands homeless. =Affected regions= Overlooking Freetown, Sugar Loaf mountain partially collapsed, triggering mudslides in the early morning of August 14, which damaged or completely submerged several houses and structures, killing residents ‚Äì many still asleep ‚Äì who were trapped inside. The collapse of the mountainside took place in two stages ‚Äì with the lower slope sliding into the Babadorie River Valley and, 10 minutes later, the upper portion collapsing, resulting in a \\"tidal wave\\" of landmass and debris. Highly mobile, the saturated debris flow from the collapse of the upper mountainside, carrying mud, large boulders, tree trunks, and other material, advanced toward the main river channel, Lumley Creek, with a wall of flood water leading in front. Another mudslide struck the Regent suburban district. A mountainous settlement east of Freetown, Regent was covered by mud and debris when nearby hillsides collapsed around 6:00 GMT. The suburban districts of Goderich and Tacuguma were also hit by mudslides, but the under-developed areas did not sustain significant damage to infrastructure or loss of life. =Aftermath= The disaster caused damage to property in an area equal to 116,766 square meters. Accessibility between communities was lost: eight pedestrian roads and bridges connecting Kamayama and Kaningo took moderate or severe damage, and two road bridges on the Regent river channel were impacted; in total, the damages to pathways amounted to US$1 million in costs. Power outages occurred in several communities, partly due to the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority's (EDSA) temporarily taking certain areas off the grid to avoid electrical incidents. The damage to EDSA's infrastructure totaled $174,000. More than 3,000 people were left homeless by the disaster. An initial estimate of the death toll placed the number at 205, but rescue and aid workers cautioned that the survival rates for many of the 600 people still missing were slim. By August 27, local government and ministry officials reported 1,000 fatalities during religious services honoring the victims. The final official death toll declared 1,141 dead or missing. Response Local organizations, military personnel, and the Red Cross of Sierra Leone contributed to immediate excavation and recovery efforts, working amid rainfall. The continued downpours and damaged passageways disrupted relief efforts, as did the topography of affected areas. The Red Cross and the federal government contributed fifteen vehicles, including three ambulances, to assist in traveling to isolated areas, while the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) sent a joint team of forensic officers and specialized rescue units with trained dogs. The Connaught Hospital mortuary in Freetown was overwhelmed by nearly 300 bodies in the first day alone, forcing workers to lay victims on floors and outside the building to be identified. Due to the lack of manpower and threat of disease, bodies were buried in mass graves on August 15 at two sites in Waterloo. Sierra Leone's Office for National Security (ONS) advised survivors to evacuate flood-prone areas. Additional evacuations took place when aerial images of a hillside adjacent to Sugar Loaf revealed the threat of another mudslide which could impact a much wider area. Response teams were deployed to two voluntary relocation centers, the Old Skool compound in Hill Station and Juba barracks in Lumley, where workers distributed sanitation and medical supplies. By August 16, workers in Regent and Kaningo began constructing emergency latrines and four 10,000-liter water harvesting systems. Unsanitary waters raised fears of cholera; however, workers provided storage tanks, purification tablets, and instructional courses on hygiene to help prevent an outbreak of waterborne diseases. The government of Sierra Leone also launched its first ever cholera vaccination campaign on September 15, targeting over 500,000 citizens in the Western Area. After the disaster, affected areas faced water shortages; as a result, UNICEF distributed 26,000 liters of drinking water each day. President Ernest Bai Koroma addressed Sierra Leone in a national broadcast August 15, declaring a state of emergency and announcing the establishment of a relief center in Regent. He urged the nation, still recovering from the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak, to remain unified: \\"Our nation has once again been gripped by grief. Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured and billions of Leones' worth of property destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city\\". He also addressed the coordination of registries in Freetown that provided aid for residents left without shelter. On August 15, the president declared seven days of national mourning, which would begin immediately. =Foreign assistance= Koroma made an appeal to the international community for relief. Already in the country, numerous international organisations acted immediately, providing basic supplies and services ‚Äì from food and shelter to personal counselling and mobile phones. Among others, Action Against Hunger, CARE International, GOAL, Handicap International, Muslim Aid, Plan International, Red Cross, Save the Children, Streetchild, Trocaire, UK Aid, World Vision and various UN agencies were involved. Several European countries responded with donations: the United Kingdom provided ¬£5 million for clean drinking water and medicine, Ireland donated ‚Ç¨400,000, Spain donated ‚Ç¨50,000 and assembled a technical forensic team, and Switzerland spent CHF400,000 to provide sanitation and first-aid kits . West African country donations included $500,000 from Togo, medical supplies distributed by Liberia, and pledges for support by Guinea and Nigeria. Other governments such as China donated $1 million through their embassy in Freetown, and Israel sent an envoy supplying food and medical supplies. In response to the disaster, the United Nations (UN) arranged contingency plans to mitigate potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases. The UN's migration agency allocated $150,000 in initial-response aid and mobilized personnel in Sierra Leone to assist in rescue operations and distribute supplies to survivors. The World Food Programme (WFP) provided rations for 7,500 people. The European Union (EU) authorized ‚Ç¨300,000 for humanitarian aid on August 16. On August 17, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) approved CHF4.6 million worth of aid to be distributed through the Sierra Leone Red Cross agency for use over a 10-month period. Three months removed from the disaster, the Sierra Leone government announced the closure of emergency camps, which housed many families awaiting financial assistance. About 98 families from the UK-Aid and World Food Programme-sponsored camps received assistance, yet nearly 500 families housed in informal refuges had not prior to the November 15 deadline.

Meredith examines the many challenges much of Africa has faced including civil conflict and lawlessness, government corruption and dictatorships. Africa is described as a continent where \\"bad-news stories (famine, genocide, corruption) massively outweigh the good (South Africa).\\" Reception In The Age Pamela Bone wrote that in \\"this big, exhaustive history Martin Meredith leaves us in little doubt as to what he believes is the primary cause of Africa's pain: its corrupt, tyrannical, incompetent, thieving, \\"vampire-like\\" leaders...

Career =Playing= In his native Poland, Orlowski played as a forward for clubs such as Gofabet Gorzkowice, Piotrcovia Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski and WKS Grunwald Pozna≈Ñ. Later, in 1984, he fled to Austria to escape from the political regression and the Soviet subjugation of his home country. He was then granted refugee status in New York, anglicized his name from Ryszard Or≈Çowski to Richard, and settled in Pennsylvania. While living in the United States, he played for a succession of Polish-American teams and even had a stint in the Cayman Islands. =Nepal= Orlowski was selected as Nepal national football team assistant coach along with Polish-American Jack Stefanowski- who was head coach. Their best result was a 2-1 victory over India in the 2013 SAFF Championship, before getting knocked out by Afghanistan en route to the final. =Anguilla= Orlowski was assigned the Anguilla head coach role in 2015, taking ownership of a team composed of construction workers, bankers, teachers, and boat builders. During his time there, he brought increased professionalism and tactical intuition to the country. Also, he recorded three friendly wins- two against the British Virgin Islands and one versus a non- FIFA nation, Saint Martin by galvanizing the players with the possibility of moving up the World Rankings into performing well. Those three triumphs were Anguilla's first wins in the space of fourteen years. But when the FIFA World Rankings were updated, Anguilla had not received any points even though the British Virgin Islands were a FIFA nation. FIFA never rectified the error and, when Anguilla had to play Nicaragua for a 2018 World Cup qualifier, they lost twice on a combined score of 8-0; Orlowski resigned after eight months in charge. =Belize= Assigned Belize manager ahead of the 2017 Copa Centroamericana , he led the Jaguars to a 0-0 draw with Panama in their opening fixture. However, his team lost all their remaining group stage matches after that. His main ambition for the national team is to get youth involved in soccer at a much younger age and also wants more friendlies against better opposition as it would be beneficial to the teams chemistry and quality of play. He is also involved with the youth sides of the Belize national team from the under-15 level. On account of this, he has drafted some younger players into the senior squad.

He studied art at Christchurch's Ilam School of Fine Arts, graduating in 1966, and had his first exhibition in 1967. He became an art teacher at Blenheim's Marlborough Girls' College in 1970 whilst also pursuing his own art. In 1975, he was named Frances Hodgkins Fellow at the University of Otago. During his time as Hodgkins fellow he became friends with former Fellowship recipient Ralph Hotere, who became Parker's unofficial artistic mentor. Parker later honoured his late friend with the massive 2016 work Plain Song for Ralph (the Hotere canvas), which was painted on canvas which had previously been owned by Hotere. Hotere's art influenced Parker's, though Parker's paintings were aimed more at evoking an \\"emotional response from the viewer, rather than conveying a message\\". Parker's work progressed from photographs and drawings to oil pastels, before he began working in oil paint on large canvases, the medium for which he is best known. His key works are large-scale colour field abstracts inspired by the Marlborough landscape that surrounds Blenheim. His most well-known series of works was the extended Plain Song series, which he worked on from the 1980s until his death. These works were an attempt to express the colours of the Marlborough landscape in musical terms, \\"creating a symphonic tone poem in paint [...], with bold, heavily impastoed canvases which nevertheless have both subtle delicacy and a rigorous use of geometry\\".\\"J.

History  =Native American settlement= Tribes of the Ottawa people native to Michigan originally spanned from the Grand River to the nearby Pere Marquette River, with tribes migrating throughout the seasons between settlements. In 1855, a federal treaty between nine tribes of the Ottawa, which would later be known as the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, established the Pashawsey Indian Reserve, which settled the Ottawa into modern day Eden Township along the lake. Ownership of the lands in the area was never determined and many moved back to the Manistee River or had left lumber camps in Wisconsin by 1900. =Pleiness family= In 1881, John Jacob Pleiness moved into the area at the age of seven with his mother and father after their home at Fort Hope was destroyed in a fire. In the 1890s, Pleiness established a blacksmith shop on the southeastern plot near the lake, which was then known as Lost Lake, and later established a farm. Between 1887 and 1909, the Mason and Oceana Railroad operated directly south of Lost Lake. The area and much of the United States experienced an extreme drought in the summer of 1930 shortly before the Dust Bowl period, which occurred for the most of the decade. Pleiness' son, John Jacob Pleiness Jr., reported in September 1930 that the lake's waterline fell about to its lowest level in over 40 years. =Modern history= In October 1941, communities proposed to change the name from Lost Lake since there were another 25 lakes in Michigan with the same name. It was proposed to rename Lost Lake to Pashawsey Lake in October 1941 to recognize the Pashawsey Indian Reserve that once incorporated the lake into its area, with \\"pashawsey\\" meaning \\"light\\" in the Ottawa language. At the meeting, the decision of Mason County supervisors was to rename Lost Lake to Pleiness Lake. In the summer of 1942, there was little resort activity at the lake. John Jacob Pleiness died on November 22, 1948. Since then, cottages have been constructed on the lake and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and county constructed a boat launch and outhouse in the southern portion of the lake. Ecology =Fish= In the early 1900s, the Michigan Board of Fish Commissioners began planting fish into Pleiness Lake. On August 15, 1905, 75 adult largemouth bass were introduced and an additional 1,500 largemouth bass fingerlings were introduced on July 12, 1906. Fish inhabiting Pleiness Lake include: =Plants= In the 1940s, Eurasian watermilfoil, a submerged aquatic plant, was introduced into North America and became invasive. Similar to other lakes in Michigan, Pleiness Lake has had to combat the growth of Eurasian watermilfoil, with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality partnering with Mason County to spray the lake when necessary.

A protest album inspired by events such as the 2015 Baltimore protests and the Ferguson unrest, the album regards the authoritarian power of law enforcement in the United States and the illusion of democracy existing in the western part of the world. Its cover art by Josh Kline, Babok Radboy, and Joerg Lohse is a photograph of one of the \\"police teletubbies\\" found in Kline's art piece \\"Freedom,\\" which was intended to present how civil rights were being destroyed in the 21st century. Brute features samples of the Ferguson protest, an MSNBC report of Occupy Wall Street by Lawrence O'Donnell, and an interview with a former member of the LAPD regarding the power of the police. Released by Hyperdub in March 2016, Brute garnered significant media coverage for its unique political message and was listed in the \\"Top Ten Protest Albums Of 2016\\" by Shadowproof, where Kevin Gosztola described it as \\"the kind of album that will carry even more resonance in the era of President Donald Trump.\\" However, some critics with more mixed opinions towards the album called it too similar to Qadiri's previous releases and found many of the songs too formless. History Qadiri's experience of having her civil rights violated came from living in Kuwait during its invasion by Iraqi forces in 1990. It wasn't until she attended college that she moved to the United States. As she discussed how she viewed the nation before she relocated there, \\"I thought America was kind of like Saved By The Bell and Fresh Prince of Bel Air. I'd never set foot there before going to college, and my perception of it was very far removed from the truth, you know? I was just consuming American TV shows like any other kid around the world, thinking, \\"Oh, it looks so cute.\\"Woon, Madeleine (9 June 2016). \\"Fatima Al Qadiri On Beyonc√©, Police Brutality & Her Most Political Album Yet\\". Oyster. Retrieved 14 August 2017. In terms of experience in protesting, Qadiri was at a counterdemonstration at a 1999 IMF World Bank meeting: \\"I have never seen more cops in my entire life. There were cops on horses, on bicycles, on bikes, in cars, and helicopters. I had a very rude awakening; the illusions of American democracy were destroyed almost immediately.\\" She was also involved in the New York City protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Qadiri began writing her second album around February/March 2015 while having to be a room in her Kuwait home due to a knee injury. She was looking at a \\"horrific news cycle\\" on Twitter, being \\"moved\\" by seeing protests going on in places such as Ferguson and Baltimore. This inspired Qadiri to make a record about protesting halfway into writing her next record. As she explained in a Thump interview, \\"I also saw it as a challenge. Protest music is a real genre, and there have been a lot of seminal protest records. I just feel like this is a subject that's moving a lot of people right now.\\" The first track completed for the album was \\"Blood Moon,\\" the last \\"Oubliette.\\" On 20 January 2016, it was announced that Brute would be released on 4 March 2016 and \\"Battery\\" was issued as the lead single.

Concept Compared by some reviewers to Hyperdub founder Kode9's album Nothing (2015) and his pieces about sonic warfare such as Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear (2009), Brute deals with themes of neoliberal fascism, authoritarianism, the rising power of the law enforcement system in the United States,Lhooq, Michelle (12 February 2016). \\"Fatima Al Qadiri‚Äôs ‚ÄòBrute‚Äô is the Powerful Political Album We've Been Waiting For\\".

Protest music is a call-to-action, and this is not a call-to-action because I don‚Äôt know what the action should be. I‚Äôm not offering any solutions, just saying that this is the reality.‚Äù Qadiri said that she titled the album Brute as a \\"counterpoint to the word thug, and how people over the last two years have been speaking about thugs in the media.\\" She also reasoned that the word \\"contains a lot of savagery, but also, in English, it has a dandyish, almost 1950s-ish sense.\\" Composition and sound design Lawrence O'Donnell's MSNBC report on Occupy Wall Street appears on Brute. Now critic Kevin Ritchie wrote that Brute has a minimal structure that \\"sometimes ris[es] in urgency before falling into a deceptive calm.\\" Brute is the most grime-infused LP in Qadiri's discography, where signature sounds of the genre such as gunshot-like percussion, swirling melodies, and police siren sound effects are heard many times throughout. Joseph Burnett of Dusted found it unlike most other grime music in that it is \\"rarely propulsive or tailored for the dancefloor, but rather shift and shake convulsively under the weight of stark, metronomic beats, swathes of sub-bass and icy synth swirls.\\" As AllMusic journalist Andy Kellman wrote, Brute uses a combination of real and simulated representations of protests that gives it a surreal feal. Because of its themes regarding powerful law enforcement, Brute has a hopeless tone coming from its use of what Jake Hulyer labeled as a \\"cold and stark\\" structure with an \\"unwelcoming atmosphere:\\" audio snippets of political rallies, minor chord structures, synthesized horns and choirs, and what Lhooq described as \\"apocalyptic bass growls.\\" While Brute is based on an American topic, Qadiri wanted to make the instrumentals \\"universal\\" for listeners from other nations across the globe to resonate with it. Brute's oppressive vibe comes from the drum parts, specifically how the \\"rhythms jerk at unnatural angles\\" and \\"beats drop like gas canisters,\\" wrote Stephen Worthy of Mixmag. As Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound wrote, \\"an ever-lurking, low-end wake\\" is used to represent an omnipresent police force on songs like ‚ÄúBattery‚Äù and ‚Äú10-34,\\" \\"volatile harmonic breaks signifying the frequent outbursts of unmitigated violence.\\" There are very few glimpses of a hopeful vibe on the album, such as the electronic harps on the song \\"Fragmentation.\\" As Burnett wrote, \\"Listen carefully, and there is a certain melodicism nestled in the heart of this album, but its tone is despairing and subdued, glimmers of light in a dark and uncaring world.\\" Burnett suggested that the reason for this was to show the \\"uncaring, uncomprehending barrier that has been erected between authority and the demos, between the powerful and the rest of us.\\" Brute primarily uses three audio sources, which Qadiri garnered via YouTube. One of them is a live recording of the Ferguson protests where a policeman says \\"you are no longer peacefully assembling\\" through a Long Range Acoustic Device, which is played over an industrial instrumental on the opening track \\"Endzone.\\"Burnett, Joseph (24 February 2016). \\"Fatima Al Qadiri ‚Äî Brute (Hyperdub)\\".

Another one is Lawrence O'Donnell's MSNBC report about Occupy Wall Street, which Qadiri chose for his \\"classic American media news anchor voice,\\" which is played on the track \\"Blows.\\" It is filtered in reverb and \\"half-shrouded\\" in synthesizers to put the listener far away from what's really going, wrote Rory Gibb of The Quietus.Gibb, Rory (3 March 2016). \\"The Lead Review: Rory Gibb On Fatima Al Qadiri's Brute\\". The Quietus. Retrieved 14 August 2017. Another one of these samples is an interview with a former LAPD sergeant named Cheryl Dorsey about the power of police officers which plays on the LP's closer \\"Power\\" over synthesized glass-breaking sounds. The samples are used at a minimum \\"just to illustrate the context, to set the tone,\\" Qadiri explained.

The art piece was meant to showcase how civil rights were being destroyed in the 21st century and uses Qadiri's cover of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" The cover art for Brute consists of a photograph of one of the teletubbies altered by Babak Radboy to give it face hair, broken blood vessels, and chapped lips. Qadiri explained, \\"He Frankensteined it. He gave it life.

Resident Advisor's Andrew Ryce wrote that most of the LP's samples were its only parts that distinguished it from previous releases: \\"Otherwise, we're given titles like \\"10-34\\" and \\"Oubliette,\\" words that gesture towards a theme without providing substance.\\" A reviewer for musicOMH called it a \\"frustrating album\\" and a \\"missed opportunity,\\" writing that it \\"has the ability to unnerve and unsettle to the point of creating a paranoid world for the listener\\" but too much of the songs are \\"formless pieces that drift instead of acting as a counterpoint to the oppression that lets Brute down.\\" Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian praised the political theme as \\"bracing\\" but opined that the album wasn't \\"enjoyable to listen to\\" due to its \\"limp compositions\\" and use of sounds like Fairlight CMI-esque voices and \\"ultra- synthetic\\" drums that became a cliche in underground electronic music due to the popularity of works by acts such as Oneohtrix Point Never and Visionist.

First erected in 1661 by the City of Hamburg on the sandbank Scharh√∂rn and south side of the Elbe estuary, it was rebuilt over centuries and taken down finally in 1979. Equipped with a room, it also functioned as a refuge beacon for shipwreck survivors from 1840 to 1965.Manfred Temme: Vogelfreist√§tte Scharh√∂rn, Verein Jordsand, 1967 The only remaining element today is the boulder stone foundation near Nigeh√∂rn. With a height of 29.10 meters, it was the highest daymark from 1898 until 23 December 1914 on the North Sea coast. Often destroyed by storms, it was also taken down in wartime to make navigation harder for enemy ships.  Function  Bearing (red) from the Rothe Ton via the Scharh√∂rnbake to the Great Tower Neuwerk (1721) View from the Rothe Ton with the Scharh√∂rnbake (1) in front of the Great Tower Neuwerk (4) (1831) The Scharh√∂rn Baak (1) as part of the various navigational aids around and on Neuwerk (1831) The main function of the daymark was to aid navigation for ships around the feared Scharh√∂rn Reef into the Elbe coming from the North Sea. Many ships wrecked at this dangerous passage. As Hamburg depended most on this, it maintained sea marks around the reefs and the routes via the S√ºdergatt und Nordergatt starting 1440. Coming from the sea the first and most important on starboard was the Rothe Ton. The bearing to the Great Tower Neuwerk via the Scharh√∂rnbake was essential to spot is beacon (see red line). Further bearings using the Great Tower Neuwerk were: * the Nordbake to obscure the Bl√ºse Neuwerk and later the (small) Lighthouse Neuwerk to spot the Scharton (before the Vogelsand, blue line) and * the Werkbalger Bake to spot the Butterton (after the Vogelsand, green Linie). Considering the cost and effort to build and maintain the Scharh√∂rnbake as the highest daymark and the Great Tower Neuwerk as the oldest \\"sea tower\\" underlines the importance of the Elbe estuary to the city and state of Hamburg. The room for refugees was added around 1840. The emergency provisions were routinely refreshed. As the sandbank Scharh√∂n grew into an island by plantations, this function was made obsolete by the first shacks starting 1929.  Appearance  Form and position varied with each reconstruction. At first, it was a wooden structure combining a pyramid and a square. It was not until the mid 19th century that it appeared in its striking form consisting of two diamonds above each other.

History  Herman wrote \\"\\" as a text in 28 stanzas of six lines each, reflecting the Passion of Jesus. The hymn opens referring to the Last Supper, and continues with the appeal to always remember the death and bitter suffering (\\"Tod und bitter Leiden\\"). The hymnologist Philipp Wackernagel notes in his Bibliography on the history of German hymns of the 16th century, from 1855, that the hymn appeared in a Wittenberg hymnal by Nikolaus Herman from 1560, (The Sundays' Gospels through the year in songs written for the children and Christian fathers). It came with the header \\"\\" (\\"The Passion / of our LORD Jesus / Christ, to the melody, Kompt her zu mir ...). While the first publication mentioned two melodies to which the words could be sung (\\"\\" and \\"\\"), the melody associated with the text today appeared first in G√∂rlitz in 1611. The hymn is contained with this melody in the hymnal by Gottfried Vopelius on page 140. Johann Hermann Schein composed a choral setting as part of his in 1627. Johann Sebastian Bach composed a four-part setting, BWV 285, which is without text. It was published as No. 196 in the collection of chorales by Johann Philipp Kirnberger und Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach.

This is a list of stretch-curd cheeses, comprising cheeses prepared using the pasta filata technique. The cheeses manufactured from this technique undergo a plasticising and kneading treatment of the fresh curd in hot water, which gives them fibrous structures. citing Stretch-curd cheeses Oaxaca cheese Ragusano cheese Straddled forms of caciocavallo hang to age Smoked Parenica Discs of Sulguni * Akkawi ‚Äì a white brined cheese originating from the city of Acre (Akko), Israel. Its texture can be compared to mozzarella, feta or a mizithra, since it does not melt easily. The texture and flavor is a result of its specific culturing from its curds that are kept together for a prolonged period longer than simpler tasting curd cheese such as Syrian cheese when akkai is transformed into cheese. * Braided cheese ‚Äì made from strips of highly elastic cheese wound together in a braid. Turkey, Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, and many Latin American nations make varieties of braided cheese. * Cacio figurato ‚Äì a type of pasta filata cheese manufactured in Sicily, Italy made from cow's milk. * Caciocavallo ‚Äì is a type of pasta filata cheese made out of sheep's or cow's milk. It is produced throughout Southern Italy, particularly in the Apennine Mountains and in the Gargano peninsula. Shaped like a tear-drop, it is similar in taste to the aged Southern Italian Provolone cheese, with a hard edible rind. * Galbanino ‚Äì a soft, mild, cheese produced by the Italian company Galbani, it most closely resembles a mild provolone cheese. * Halloumi ‚Äì a Cypriot semihard, unripened, brined cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk, and sometimes also cow's milk. It is set with rennet and is unusual in that no acid or acid-producing bacterium is used in its preparation. * Kashkaval ‚Äì a hard yellow cheese made of cow's milk, sheep's milk, or both. It dates to the 11th and 12th centuries, and is popular in several mediterranean countries. * Mozzarella ‚Äì a traditionally southern Italian dairy product made by the pasta filata method. Mozzarella received a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed certification from the European Union in 1998. This protection scheme requires that mozzarella sold in the European Union is produced according to a traditional recipe. ** Bocconcini ‚Äì small mozzarella cheese the size of an egg, it is prepared in the pasta filata manner by dipping curds into hot whey, and kneading, pulling and stretching. ** Buffalo mozzarella is made from the milk of Mediterranea Italiana buffalo. It is traditionally manufactured in Campania, especially in the provinces of Caserta and Salerno. * Oaxaca cheese ‚Äì a white, semihard cheese from Mexico, similar to un-aged Monterey Jack, but with a mozzarella- like string cheese texture. The production process is complicated and involves stretching the cheese into long ribbons and rolling it up like a ball of yarn. * Oscypek is a smoked cheese made using salted sheep's milk and some cow's milk that is made exclusively in the Tatra Mountains region of Poland. Unpasteurized salted sheep's milk is first turned into cottage cheese, which is then repeatedly rinsed with boiling water and squeezed. After this, the mass is pressed into wooden, spindle-shaped forms in decorative shapes. The forms are then placed in a brine-filled barrel for a night or two, after which they are placed close to the roof in a special wooden hut and cured in hot smoke for up to 14 days. * O≈°tiepok is a traditional smoked sheep's milk cheese made in Slovakia; it is a protected trade name under the EU's protected geographical indication. * Pallone di Gravina is a firm cow's milk cheese from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy. It is made in the pasta filata style weighing between , in a pear-like shape, ball, or balloon (pallone), and was traditionally produced in the area of the city of Gravina, in the Murgia area of the province of Bari. Today, however, production is centered in the province of Matera. * Parenica ‚Äì a protected trade name under the EU's protected geographical indication, it is a traditional Slovak cheese that is semifirm, nonripening, semifat, steamed, and usually smoked, although a nonsmoked version is also produced. * Provolone ‚Äì an aged semihard Italian pasta filata cheese originating in Casilli near Vesuvius, where it is still produced in pear, sausage, or cone shapes varying from long. Its taste varies significantly, from provolone piccante (sharp/piquant), aged for a minimum of four months and with a very sharp taste, to provolone dolce (sweet) with a very mild taste. In provolone piccante, the distinctive piquant taste is produced with lipase (enzyme) derived from goat. The Dolce version uses calf's lipase instead. * Ragusano cheese is an Italian cow's milk cheese produced in Ragusa, in Sicily in southern Italy. It is a firm stretched-curd cheese made with whole milk from cows of the Modicana breed, raised exclusively on fresh grass or hay in the provinces of Ragusa and Syracuse. The cheese was awarded Italian Denominazione di Origine Controllata protection in 1955 and EU DOP status in 1995. * Scamorza ‚Äì an Italian stretched-curd cow's milk cheese, it can also be made from other milks, but this is less common. In its preparation, the fresh curd matures in its own whey for several hours to allow acidity to develop by the process of lactose being converted to lactic acid. Artisanal cheese makers generally form the cheese into a round shape, and then tie a string around the mass one-third of the distance from the top, and hang to dry. The resulting shape is pear-like. * Stracciata ‚Äì a fresh cow's milk pasta filata cheese produced in Italy, it is formed into flat strips of about 4‚Äì5 cm wide, 1 cm thick, and folded in on itself in a uniform manner or woven wire. The name stracciata means \\"tattered\\" in Italian. * Stracciatella di bufala is a cheese produced from Italian buffalo milk in the province of Foggia, located in the southern Italian region of Apulia, using a stretching and a shredding technique. * String cheese refers to several different types of cheese where the manufacturing process aligns the proteins in the cheese, which makes it stringy. ** Chechil is a brine string cheese that originated in Armenia.Petrosian., I. and Underwood., D. (2006). Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction and Folklore. Yerkir Publishing, Bloomington, Indiana, USA. It has a consistency approximating that of mozzarella or sulguni, and is produced in the form of dense strings, rolled up in a figure eight of thick braid-shaped ropes. ** Korb√°ƒçik is a type of semihard or medium hard string cheese interwoven into fine braids. It originates from the Orava region of northern Slovakia. The two main variants of Korb√°ƒçik are smoked and unsmoked. * Sulguni ‚Äì a brined Georgian cheese from the Samegrelo region. It has a sour, moderately salty flavor, a dimpled texture, and an elastic consistency; these attributes are the result of the process used, and the source of its moniker \\"pickle cheese\\". The fried cheese is a popular dish in Georgia.

Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and a direct sequel to Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders. It premiered at the New York Comic Con on October 8, 2017, was released digitally on October 10, 2017,Batman vs. Two-Face Release Date Announced - Cosmic Book News and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 17, 2017. Based on the 1960s Batman TV series, the film stars Adam West (in his final role before his death), Burt Ward and Julie Newmar reprising their roles of Batman, Robin and Catwoman from the series. The film included a tribute to the late West after the end credits (\\"In Loving Memory of Adam West (1928-2017). Rest well, Bright Knight.\\"). Plot Batman and Robin meet Gotham District Attorney Harvey Dent at a top-secret demonstration hosted by Professor Hugo Strange. With his assistant Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Strange operates a machine called the \\"Evil Extractor\\" designed to siphon evil from criminals and store it in a vat. Batman scoffs, noting there is no easy path to righteousness, but the machine does work‚Äîtoo well, as the Joker and other volunteers laugh manically in an attempt to overload the machine. The containment vat explodes, drenching Dent with liquified evil, which scars half his face and changes his personality. Harvey, now re-christened Two-Face, embarks on a criminal career as seen in the opening credits, all of which his attempts are foiled by the Dynamic Duo. He is eventually whisked to a hospital where his face has been given reconstructive surgery. His sanity has apparently been restored as well, and he is allowed to resume crimefighting as the assistant to the Assistant District Attorney. Six months later, the Dynamic Duo engage King Tut and his henchmen, who have stolen a biplane and attacked an Egyptian-themed event that Aunt Harriet and Alfred Pennyworth are attending. While the civilians escape, the heroes are subdued by Tut's goons. They escape a deathtrap using Batjets in their shoes and capture Tut and his men, but their loot is taken by Two- Face's henchmen, unknown to Batman and Robin. Batman, Robin, Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara interrogate McElroy as Harvey waits in the shadows, with O'Hara constantly hitting the professor on the head with his truncheon to switch his personality, with Tut's stubborn attitude causing himself to bring back McElroy. McElroy's lawyer Lucilee Diamond intervenes and ushers them out of the room so that she can speak to him. At Professor McElroy's trial, she implicates that the concussion is nothing more than a threat to a mild- mannered man. Chief O'Hara tearfully confesses to hitting McElroy and Harvey calls Batman as his next witness, but Professor McElroy himself admits his guilt, ready to suffer the minimum penalty of being rehabilitated in prison. After the sentencing, Harvey shares a highball with Bruce Wayne much to Dick's annoyance at bearing the hardships of a third wheel. Harvey is then due to an attend a charity for underprivileged twins at the Winning Pair casino just as Bruce and Dick resume their identities as Batman and Robin once more. A package has arrived at Commissioner Gordon's office, a World Atlas book marked for Batman, with its pages eaten away in three holes. Robin surmises the culprit to be Bookworm and the duo race off in the Batmobile to find him at the Gotham City Library where a fight ensues and the three priceless books that Bookworm had his eyes on have disappeared. Batman and Robin deduce that the stolen books were all about duality, but Two-Face has already been reformed and so they try to find another way behind it. Regardless, they head to an abandoned sign factory with Two-Face and his henchmen waiting for them. After defeating the goons, Two-Face pins them with a large number two and the flip of his coin landing on the right side spares their lives. Once they have left, Batman believes that Harvey has made a lot of enemies in his career and they are all out to destroy it. Meanwhile, Harvey is having some problems of his own after he makes a phone call to none other than Two-Face, who kidnaps Professor Strange as part of their scheme. Robin is punished to his room by Batman after nearly getting into a row about Harvey's involvement in Two- Face's plans and Catwoman, who by now has been stood up, escapes her cell by switching places with Lucilee Diamond. Following Harvey to the laboratory, Robin is ambushed by Two-Face and Professor Strange corrupts him with some of the gas from the extractor that mutates the left side of his body. Batman is forced to fight his beloved sidekick who cures him back at the Batcave, following Two-Face to the casino where he is in fact revealed to be Dent, having suppressed his bad side (√° la Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). Once the Dynamic Duo are strapped to a large silver dollar, he unmasks Batman and deduces Robin's true identity. Then Two-Face invites Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Egghead, Shame, Clock King and Catwoman to an auction for the highest bidder of Batman's true identity. With Catwoman's help, Batman and Robin defeat the villains, but Two-Face gets away on the biplane stolen by King Tut, intending to use the evil gas to remake Gotham City in his image. The Dynamic Duo manage to shoot him down towards a flaming factory where Batman goes one on one with Two-Face, who completely takes over Harvey's body. In a battle of wits, Batman urges Harvey to regain self-control and he does, defeating Two-Face for good as they escape the factory. The next morning, Batman and Robin use the Batwing to cure the infected Gothamites. Months later, Harvey still appears to have repressed Two-Face and forgotten Batman's secret identity. He holds a bachelor auction at Wayne Manor with the Caped Crusader himself as the first bachelor. Batman appears before everyone, and to his delight, ends up having the first person to bid for him being none other than Catwoman.

India currently only grows GM cotton, while China produces GM varieties of cotton, poplar, petunia, tomato, papaya and sweet pepper. Cost of enforcement of regulations in India are generally higher, possibly due to the greater influence farmers and small seed firms have on policy makers, while the enforcement of regulations was more effective in China.Inderscience. Inderscience.metapress.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. Other Asian countries that grew GM crops in 2011 were Pakistan, the Philippines and Myanmar. GM crops were approved for commercialisation in Bangladesh in 2013 and in Vietnam and Indonesia in 2014. China GM crops in China go through three phases of field trials (pilot field testing, environmental release testing, and preproduction testing) before they are submitted to the Office of Agricultural Genetic Engineering Biosafety Administration (OAGEBA) for assessment. Producers must apply to OAGEBA at each stage of the field tests. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology developed the first biosafety regulations for GM products in 1993 and they were updated in 2001. The 75 member National Biosafety Committee evaluates all applications, although OAGEBA has the final decision. Most of the National Biosafety Committee are involved in biotechnology leading to criticisms that they do not represent a wide enough range of public concerns. India The release of transgenic crops in India is governed by the Indian Environment Protection Act, which was enacted in 1986. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC), Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) and Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) all review any genetically modified organism to be released, with transgenic crops also needing permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.TNAU Agritech Portal :: Bio Technology.

The Food Sanitation Law has been amended and updated many times; an amendment dealing with pre-market approval and labeling of GMOs was passed in 2000 and came into effect in 2001. Japan passed laws to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in September 2003 which came into effect in February 2004 - the Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms (Law No. 97 of 2003).Teiji Takahashi December 2009 Laws and Regulations on Food Safety and Food Quality in Japan Accessed June 15, 2014Japan's Alien species and LMO Regulation office, Wildlife Division, Nature Conservation Bureau Ministry of the Environment Biosafety Regulations in Japan Accessed June 15, 2014 Authority for approvals for various uses of genetically modified organisms is divided in Japan. The Ministry of the Environment has final approval for all uses of GMOs, but crops for commercial use and live vaccines for animals first go through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; viruses for gene therapy and other medical applications first go through the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare; field trials of GM crops and recombinant DNA used in biotechnology research first goes through the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; and uses in the process of production of industrial enzymes, etc. goes through the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Japan has not approved any commodity GM crops to be grown in Japan, but does allow import of agricultural products made from GM crops and food made of imported GM ingredients. Japan does however allow cultivation of GM flowers (e.g. Blue roses). GM foods must undergo a safety assessment prior to being awarded certification for distribution to the domestic market.

However, processed food in which recombinant DNA or protein is dissolved in or removed during processing, such as soy sauce, soybean oil, corn flakes, millet jelly, corn oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, and others, do not have to be labeled. Japan does not require traceability, and allows negative labeling (\\"GMO-free\\" and the like).

A petition filed on May 17, 2013 by environmental group Greenpeace Southeast Asia and farmer-scientist coalition Masipag (Magsasaka at Siyentipiko sa Pagpapaunlad ng Agrikultura) asked the appellate court to stop the planting of Bt eggplant in test fields, saying the impacts of such an undertaking to the environment, native crops and human health are still unknown. The Court of Appeals granted the petition, citing the precautionary principle stating \\"when human activities may lead to threats of serious and irreversible damage to the environment that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish the threat.\\" Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in June 2013 and on September 20, 2013 the Court of Appeals chose to uphold their May decision saying the bt talong field trials violate the people‚Äôs constitutional right to a \\"balanced and healthful ecology.\\" The Supreme Court on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 permanently stopped the field testing for Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) talong (eggplant), upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals which stopped the field trials for the genetically modified eggplant.

A majority of Parisians are still nominally Roman Catholic. According to 2011 statistics, there are 106 parishes and curates in the city, plus separate parishes for Spanish, Polish and Portuguese Catholics. There are an additional 10 Eastern Orthodox parishes, and bishops for the Armenian and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. In addition there are 80 male religious orders and 140 female religious orders in the city, as well as 110 Catholic schools with 75,000 students. The principal Roman Catholic church in Paris is the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, the seat of the Archbishop of Paris. There are two officially recognised pilgrimage sites in Paris: the Basilique du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de Montmartre and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. Cardinal Andr√© Vingt-Trois became the Archbishop of Paris in March 2005. Almost all Protestant denominations are represented in Paris, with 74 evangelical churches from various denominations, including 21 parishes of the United Protestant Church of France and two parishes of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints. There are several important churches for the English-speaking community: the American Church in Paris, founded in 1814, was the first American church outside the United States; the current church was finished in 1931.

The number of mosques doubled between 1991 and 2011. Judaism During the Middle Ages, Paris was a centre of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II,Yad Vashem half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today.

Health Canada, under the Food and Drugs Act, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are responsible for evaluating the safety and nutritional value of genetically modified foods. Environmental assessments of biotechnology-derived plants are carried out by the CFIA's Plant Biosafety Office (PBO). The Canadian regulatory system is based on whether a product has novel features regardless of method of origin. In other words, a product is regulated as GM if it carries some trait not previously found in the species whether it was generated using traditional breeding methods (e.g. selective breeding, cell fusion, mutation breeding) or genetic engineering.Evans, Brent and Lupescu, Mihai (15 July 2012) Canada - Agricultural Biotechnology Annual ‚Äì 2012 GAIN (Global Agricultural Information Network) report CA12029, United States Department of Agriculture, Foreifn Agricultural Service, Retrieved 2 November 2012.Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee (CBAC), Consultation Document 2001: Regulation of Genetically Modified Food, page 2, Definition of \\"Genetically Modified\\": \\"The term ‚Äúgenetically modified foods‚Äù (GM foods) refers to foods that have been produced using recent advances in gene technology, such as gene cloning, genesplicing and plant transformation.\\" Retrieved August 27, 2019.

This data includes: information on how the GM plant was developed; nucleic acid data that characterizes the genetic change; composition and nutritional data of the novel food compared to the original non-modified food' potential for new toxins; and potential for being an allergen. A decision is then made whether to approve the product for release along with any restrictions or requirements. Labeling of foods as products of Genetic Engineering or not products of Genetic Engineering is voluntary.Staff (20 July 2012) Voluntary Labelling and Advertising of Foods that are and are not Products of Genetic Engineering Public Works and Government Services Canada, National Standard of Canada, Retrieved 1 November 2012. Reaffirmed 2016 The Canadian regulations were reviewed by the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee between 1999 and 2003, with the conclusion that the current level of regulation was satisfactory. The committee was accused by environmental and citizen groups of not representing the full spectrum of public interests by only having one member of the board of 20 representing non-governmental organisations and for being too closely aligned to industry groups. Mexico In February 2005, after consulting the Mexican Academy of Sciences, Mexico's senate passed a law allowing to plant and sell genetically modified cotton and soybean. The law requires all genetically modified products to be labelled according to guidelines issued by the Mexican Ministry of Health. In 2009, the government enacted statutory provisions for the regulation of genetically modified maize. Mexico is the center of diversity for maize and concerns had been raised about the impact genetically modified maize could have on local strains.Mike Shanahan Warning issued on GM maize imported to Mexico - SciDev.Net 10 November 2004Katie Mandell GM maize found ‚Äòcontaminating‚Äô wild strains - SciDev.Net 30 November 2001 In 2013, a federal judge ordered Mexico‚Äôs SAGARPA (Secretar√≠a de Agricultura, Ganader√≠a, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca, y Alimentaci√≥n), which is Mexico‚Äôs Secretary of Agriculture, and SEMARNAT (Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), equivalent of the EPA, to temporarily halt any new GMO corn permits, accepting a lawsuit brought by opponents of the crop. United States =Federal regulation= The USA is the largest commercial grower of genetically modified crops in the world. United States regulatory policy is governed by the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology This regulatory policy framework that was developed under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan to ensure safety of the public and to ensure the continuing development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation.Emily Marden, Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003) The policy as it developed had three tenets: \\"(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products.\\" In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated genetically modified crops. For a genetically modified organism to be approved for release, it must be assessed under the Plant Protection Act by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) agency within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and may also be assessed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental protection agency (EPA), depending on the intended use of the organism. The USDA evaluates the plant's potential to become a weed. The FDA has a voluntary consultation process with the developers of genetically engineered plants. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which outlines FDA's responsibilities, does not require pre-market clearance of food, including genetically modified food plants. The EPA regulates genetically modified plants with pesticide properties, as well as agrochemical residues. Most genetically modified plants are reviewed by at least two of the agencies, with many subject to all three. Within the organization are departments that regulate different areas of GM food including, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN, ) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). As of 2008, all developers of genetically modified crops in the US had made use of the voluntary process.Peggy G. Lemaux Genetically Engineered Plants and Foods: A Scientist's Analysis of the Issues (Part I) Annual Review of Plant Biology 59: 771-812 DOI: 10.1146/annurev.arplant.58.032806.103840. Quote: \\"Although GE foods can be marketed without certain regulatory approvals, to date all products in the marketplace have undergone full review by regulatory agencies regarding safety and content relative to unmodified forms (searchable data on specific events available at 84). Submitting the safety data is in the developer's best interests, however, given the legal liabilities incurred should a problem with the food arise following market introduction\\" Final approval can still be denied by individual counties within each state. In 2004, Mendocino County, California became the first county to impose a ban on the \\"Propagation, Cultivation, Raising, and Growing of Genetically Modified Organisms\\", the measure passing with a 57% majority.Marygold Walsh-Dilley (2009) \\"Localizing control: Mendocino County and the ban on GMOs\\" Agriculture and Human Values 26(1-2):95-105 In May, 2014 Jackson and Josephine Counties in Southern Oregon passed initiatives similar to that passed by Mendocino County; both passing by 2 to 1 margins.http://www.co.jackson.or.us/page.asp?navid=3967, http://www.co.josephine.or.us/files/17-58ballottitlewebsite.pdf, http://www.kgw.com/news/politics/genetically-modified-foods-260011131.html. Several laws govern the US regulatory agencies. These laws are statutes the agencies review when determining the safety of a particular GM food. These laws include: *The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (EPA); *The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (EPA); *The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (FDA and EPA); *The Plant Protection Act (PPA) (USDA); *The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (VSTA) (USDA); *The Public Health Service Act (PHSA)(FDA); *The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) (FDA) *The Meat Inspection Act (MIA)(USDA); *The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (USDA); *The Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (USDA); and *The National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). =State regulation= Several states have passed regulations concerning labelling of GM food; Connecticut passed a GMO labeling bill in May 2013, but the bill will only be triggered after four other states enact similar legislation. On January 9, 2014, Maine‚Äôs governor signed a bill requiring labeling for foods made with GMO's, with a similar triggering mechanism as Connecticut's bill.

Early life Kearney was born in Butte on May 24, 1955, the son of Martin and Louetta (Pene) Kearney. He attended Catholic schools in Butte, and graduated from Butte Central Catholic High School in 1973, where he was a runner on two consecutive state cross country championship teams. College and newscasting Kearney attended Montana State University in Bozeman, earning his degree in Film and Television in 1978. After brief stops in Great Falls (KFBB-TV as a reporter in 1979) and Billings (KTVQ-TV as a videographer 1979-1981), he was hired in 1981 as a news reporter at KXLF-TV in Butte, and promoted to news director in 1986. After leaving KXLF in 1988, he became an advertising sales executive for Butte's cable TV companies (the last being Charter Communications) from 1993 until his death. Kearney's departure from KXLF came on December 7, 1988 when he refused to accept a demotion to sports director, and filed a lawsuit against them for wrongful termination in violation of their written personnel policy. After a split decision in state district court mostly favoring KXLF, and a cross appeal by both parties, the case was decided by the Montana Supreme Court in Kearney's favor, but reducing legal fees granted by the district court to Kearney by $87.90. Sportscasting Kearney was a long-time radio broadcaster for Butte Central's football and basketball games, and served as sports historian for both Butte Central and the public Butte High School. He was also instrumental in establishing the Butte Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, to which he was enshrined in 2009. He also coached the cross country team at Butte Central. Author, historian and civic involvement Kearney wrote occasional news and sports articles for The Montana Standard up until his death, the final one about the 100th football game between Butte High and Billings Senior High School in 2014. He was also devoted to recording Butte's history as the Anaconda Copper era ended. His 1983 KXLF news story on the closing of Anaconda's last remaining Butte mining operation (Continental Pit) can be seen in the 2008 PBS documentary film Butte, America. He wrote seven books about the city and its history; an eighth book dealt with the long-time football rivalry between Montana State and the University of Montana. He was a primary interviewee for the 1999 Montana PBS documentary film Remembering the Columbia Gardens, based partly on his 1994 book Butte's Pride ‚Äì The Columbia Gardens. He served as division historian and past president of Division 1 of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In addition to founding the Butte Sports Hall of Fame, he established the annual Blarney Stone Run (since renamed in his honor) in 1983, served as co-chairman of Evel Knievel Week and the high school Class C All-Star football game, chairman and founder of the Butte Sports Foundation, co-founder and first-year chairman of the Winternational Sports Festival and manager of the Neversweat & Washoe tourist train in 1989. He made an unsuccessful run for chief executive of the Butte/Silver Bow government in 2004. Death Kearney died from a coronary blockage in his Butte home on October 12, 2014; his body was found two days later.

Currently New Zealand and Australia require labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional, or organic origins.Northwestern.edu Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property Paper on: \\"Consumer Protection\\" Consumer Strategies and the European Market in Genetically Modified Foods Australia Genetic engineering in Australia was originally (since 1987) overseen by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, before the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) and Food Standards Australia New Zealand took over in 2001. The OTGR is a Commonwealth Government Authority within the Department of Health and Ageing and reports directly to Parliament through a Ministerial Council on Gene Technology and has legislative powers. It was established as part of the Gene Technology Act 2003 and operates according to the Gene Technology Regulations 2001. The OGTR reports directly to Parliament through a Ministerial Council on Gene Technology and has legislative powers. The OGTR decides on license applications for the release of all genetically modified organisms, while regulation is provided by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for GM medicines or Food Standards Australia New Zealand for GM food. The individual state governments are then able to assess the impact of release on markets and trade and apply further legislation to control approved genetically modified products. Genetically modified cotton, canola, and carnations are grown in Australia. Genetically modified cotton has been grown commercially in New South Wales and Queensland since 1996.Information Paper on Genetically Modified Canola A report by the Ministerial GMO Industry Reference Group Chaired by the Hon Kim Chance MLC.

The Queensland and Northern Territory Governments have not implemented any further legislation beyond the national level, but several other states placed bans on planting certain GM crops. In 2007 the New South Wales government extended a blanket moratorium on GM food crops until 2011, but allowed groups to apply for exemptions. New South Wales approved GM Canola for commercial cultivation in 2008, while the Victorian government let the moratorium on GM Canola expire in 2007. Western Australia passed the Genetically Modified Crops Free Areas Act in 2003 and was declared a GM free area in 2004. In 2008 an exception was made for the commercial cultivation of GM cotton in the Ord River Irrigation Areas. Trials of GM canola were carried out in 2003 and in 2010 the Western Australian government allowed the commercialisation of GM canola. New Zealand Part of a protest march held in 2003 voicing opposition to genetic engineering, making its way up Queen St, the main thoroughfare of Auckland. Genetic engineering is a contentious issue in New Zealand. no genetically modified food was grown in New Zealand, and no medicines containing live genetically modified organisms have been approved for use.New Zealand Ministry for the EnvironmentGenetically modified medicines and food June 2004 However, medicines manufactured using genetically modified organisms that do not contain live organisms have been approved for sale, and imported foods with genetically modified components are sold. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) must approve any food produced from GM crops, or made using genetically engineered enzymes, before it can be marketed in Australia or New Zealand. FSANZ makes a list of such approvals available on its website.Food Standards Australia New Zealand FSANZ GM food approvals 8 pages, n.d. 2009? In 2000 the Government appointed a Royal Commission to report on issues relating to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Report of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, released in July 2001, concluded that New Zealand should keep its options open with regard to genetic engineering and to proceed carefully in order to minimise and manage any risks. Field trials have been carried out with GM pine trees and brassicas. Prior to the 2002 general election, the book Seeds of Distrust was published which highlighted possible contamination of imported corn seed with GMO seeds. During the election campaign the book caused an amount of friction between the Labour and Green Parties, referred to as \\"Corngate\\" in the media. Field trials of genetically engineered Pinus radiata trees is being carried out by SCION, a Crown Research Institute. Environmental activists breached the security at the site and damaged 19 of the trees in 2008. No organisation claimed responsibility but a spade left on the site had a \\"GE-free New Zealand\\" sticker attached to it. Brassica species have been approved by ERMA for a ten- year field trial in Canterbury. The conditions that were set for the trial were breached and lobbyists called for an end to the trial.

She was a leader in promoting the colonial history of the United States and helped to expand Washington State's public library system. Noel is also credited with coining the name for the popular candy, Almond Roca. Early life Jacqueline Noel was born in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 1886, the daughter of Jacob Edmund Noel (died 1918), general secretary of the Scottish Rite bodies in the Tacoma jurisdiction, and Eleanor Freaneau Leadbeater. She had one sister, who later married a Mr. Thomas W. Mason. In 1896 at the age of 10, Noel was elected secretary of the Mary Lampheer Society, Washington state's first chapter of Children of the American Revolution (C.A.R. for short). The C.A.R. had been proposed as a young people's division of the Daughters of the American Revolution at the C.A.R.'s Fourth Continental Congress in February 1895 and promptly chartered by the United States Congress. The Mary Lampheer Society first met on the one year anniversary of the C.A.R.'s formation at the Noel home in Tacoma with Jacqueline's mother, serving as president. As Washington was a new state at the time, its citizens had gathered little of historical interest to themselves, and the Society therefore devoted its attention to papers relating to the American Revolution and U.S. history with the purpose of celebrating the anniversaries of important events of revolutionary times. Noel moved to New York City to attend the Pratt Institute, from which she graduated in 1913. She then returned to the Pacific Northwest to embark on her career. Career Noel was an assistant librarian in La Grande, Oregon, and in Portland before joining the Tacoma Public Library staff in July 1914. She began in Tacoma as an assistant in the reference department, and In 1924 became city librarian. She served as chairperson to the Division of Literature at the Washington State Federation of Women's Clubs. She was also vice-president of the Pacific Northwest Library Association and a member of the American Library Association. Noel was the driving force behind the creation of branch libraries in Tacoma. By the time of her retirement in 1947, new branches were beginning to open, and by the time of her death in 1964, many more were in operation. Noel was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, The Huguenot Society of America, the Aloha Club, and the Business and Professional Woman's Club. Personal life After living in New York City, Noel moved back to Washington in 1908 and lived with her family at 3020 North Alder Street, Tacoma, Washington. Almond Roca In 1923 Tacoma confectioners Harry Brown and J.C. Haley crafted a chocolate-coated hard toffee covered in a crust of chopped almonds that made it less messy than its contemporaries. When Brown brought samples of his unnamed creation around to local residents, Noel suggested that he call it \\"Almond Roca,\\" including the Spanish word \\"roca\\", meaning \\"rock\\" in English, to describe the hard, log-shaped confection. The United States Department of War later selected the candy as a product to distribute to U.S. Military facilities around the world, and tins of Almond Roca were shipped to American soldiers during World War II and in Korea. Brown & Haley went on to develop Cashew Roca, Macadamia Roca, Peppermint Roca, Mocha Roca, as well as dark chocolate and sugar-free varieties whose names can all be attributed to Noel's suggestion. In the 1940s, Noel was living with Margaret Vildmo (b. 1918). Noel retired from her librarian work in 1947 and died in 1964.

Various other organisations, including The South African Freelancer's Organisation also stood in solidarity with this appeal. In October 2013 the cast of South Africa‚Äôs longest-running soap Generations entered a protracted contractual dispute with the public broadcaster, the SABC. When 16 cast members embarked on a so-called 'strike' barely a year later, the producer and broadcaster announced an indefinite hiatus in production. The cast were being advised by the defunct trade union CWUSA, while SAGA warned that the actors could be held in breach of contract as they were not protected by the Labour Laws. Ultimately the group of actors had their contracts terminated and the show was cancelled. When South African television drama High Rollers was abruptly cancelled in 2016, SAGA voiced concern over South African producers' willingness to cancel production contracts before expiration.

The weapon uses a rotating bolt delayed blowback operation with 2 lugs with rollers to overcome a quarter twist to accelerate the bolt carrier and unlock. To ease extraction, the barrel has a fluted chamber to prevent ruptured cartridges. The select fire capability fires from closed bolt in semi auto and open bolt in full auto.

Besides, the list of people can also be sourced from the medical screening conducted at airports,\\" he said. The tracking down is mainly done with the help of three basic technologies, including verifying mobile tower location. The location history of these people could also be sourced from Google, which has agreed to it considering the present situation. Geo-fencing technology, a location-based service to trigger a pre-programmed boundary so as to track breaches, is also being used for the purpose. \\"Hand-washing dance\\" video- The dance video has six policemen in the uniform showing the right way to wash the hands, According to Manoj Abraham, ADGP, Headquarters, and nodal officer of the Social Media Cell says \\"We didn‚Äôt expect such a reach for the videos.

Early life  Leong's mother, the Japanese pianist Sumiko Nagasawa, gave piano lessons with the infant Dana sleeping in her lap. Leong's violin instructor Marjorie Lin found that Leong possessed perfect pitch when he would repeatedly ask her to tune his violin. As a teen, he studied cello under Kathleen Johnson, Julian Hersh and Irene Sharp while also studying trombone under Paul Welcomer of the San Francisco Symphony, Wayne Wallace and Dr. Arthur Barnes and Fred Berry at Stanford University and David Taylor at the Manhattan School of Music. While in middle and high school, Leong was selected for principal positions playing both Cello & Trombone in the California All State Jazz and classical ensembles, the Monterey Jazz Festival All Star Big Band which toured Japan & California and the National Grammy High School All Star Big Band which performed at the 1997 & 1998 Grammy Awards Events with Boyz II Men and on NBC's nationally televised Today Show. At the age of 16, Leong was invited to become the youngest professor of jazz at the Stanford University Summer Jazz Workshop where he still teaches students age 12-70 styles of jazz on the topics of creative improvisation and performance. At the age of 17, Leong and the Grammy Ensemble also performed for the Presidential Summit for Anti-Violence at Philadelphia Constitution Hall, where Presidents Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Ford and Secretary General Colin Powell signed the country's first anti-gun act affecting schools nationwide.

During the 1940s she was also a successful fashion designer who was proclaimed America's top lingerie designer in 1947. Early life and education Thea Wittner was born in Berlin on June 24, 1902, although some sources state 1915. She studied at Staatliche Kunstakademie under the direction of Bruno Paul. In 1938, Thea, her Polish husband Kalman Schlachet and their son Peter came to the United States as Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, and she eventually gained American citizenship in 1944, at which time she took the surname Tewi. Tewi continued studying throughout her life, attending the SculptureCenter between 1953 and 1956, the Art Students League from 1954 to 1955, and in 1955, alongside Seymour Lipton and Manolo Pascual, she went to The New School for Social Research. In 1970, she went to research lost-wax casting and bronze casting in Pietrasanta, Italy. As fashion designer As a lingerie designer, Tewi was active in New York in the 1940s. Her brand, Tewi Lingerie Inc., was extremely successful, leading to Tewi winning a Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1945. Reporting on fashion trends that year, the Detroit Free Press referred to Tewi's \\"naughty-nice lingerie\\" featuring \\"daring cuts\\" and racy appliqu√©s. Two Thea Tewi garments are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute: a silk nightgown called \\"Busting Out All Over\\" and an embroidered silk and lace slip called \\"Ripe Roses.\\" In 1947, the Textile Colorist journal, while reporting on Tewi's electric-blanket inspired nightgowns, noted that she had been named America's top lingerie designer. In 1950, Thea Tewi Lingerie merged with another leading company, Dutchess Underwear, to offer a line called \\"Dutchess Individually Yours by Tewi.\\" In 1950, she returned to sculpting. In the 1960s, although Tewi was now regarded and established as a sculptor, she was still remembered as having been a \\"leading high fashion lingerie designer.\\" As artist Tewi started out working in metal, but switched to stone as her favourite material, particularly marble and onyx. She resumed sculpting in 1950 following her career as a lingerie designer. Tewi frequently brought Jewish themes and motifs into her sculpture, including a work using the Hebrew alphabet as its basis which won her the National Arts Club award for religious sculpture in 1966. Her stonework included an art deco style headstone for the grave of Frederick and Helen Serger in Maple Grove Cemetery, Queens, New York. She represented the United States at the 1969 Biennale in Carrara, Italy. Tewi exhibited widely from the 1960s to the early 1990s, with solo shows in galleries and venues across the United States and Italy, and participated in a number of exhibitions held across America and in Paris and Italy. Examples of her sculpture are held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Chrysler Museum of Art, and many other institutions. Her work is also owned by The Bank of Tokyo, Citicorp, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and Pfizer. Prizes Among the prizes received by Tewi were a Special Award for Outstanding Merit in Craftsmanship from the Artists- Craftsmen New York in 1967; a Medal of Honor and First Prize for Sculpture from the National Association of Women Artists in 1969; and a First Prize for Sculpture from the American Society of Contemporary Artists in 1971.

He was the older brother of the famous German writer Carl Zuckmayer (1896‚Äì1977).  Family and Youth  He was born as the first son of the wealthy factory owner Carl Zuckmayer (1864‚Äì1947) who produced Tamper-evident caps for wine bottles in Nackenheim which is a wine-growing village on the Rhine front. The parents of his mother Amalie Zuckmayer (1869‚Äì1954), n√©e Goldschmidt, were converted from Judaism to Protestantism whereas he was raised as a Catholic. From the age of six, he got piano lessons. His talent was recognised early. At the age of twelve, he started to compose. However, he started to study jurisprudence but soon quit. In 1909 he took private piano lessons from Robert Kahn (1865‚Äì1951) and James Kwast (1852‚Äì1927) in Berlin. He also attended the conductor's school of Fritz Steinbach (1855‚Äì1916) and became a piano pupil of Lazzaro Uzielli (1861‚Äì1943) at Conservatory in Cologne. In 1914 he got concert level as pianist and conductor.University of Hamburg, Germany: Eduard Zuckmayer, biography.  Work  = Germany = In 1915 he was a conductor at City theatre in Mainz. He and his younger brother volunteered as soldiers in World War I. He was severely wounded and decorated twice with the Iron cross 2nd class and later with the Iron cross 1st class. Between 1919 and 1925 he lived in Frankfurt where he performed Paul Hindemith's Sonata in D for violin and piano op. 11, No. 2.Andreas Briner: Paul Hindemith, Schott's S√∂hne, Mainz / Atlantis Verlag, Z√ºrich 1971. He worked as a music teacher, conductor, and pianist. In 1923 he became co-founder of Gesellschaft f√ºr Neue Musik (= Society of New Music) in Mainz and Wiesbaden. From 1923 to 1925 he also led a piano class at Mainz conservatory. At that time he was regarded as a brilliant concert pianist with a high chance for a marvellous career. But as an enthusiast of German Jugendmusikbewegung (= Youth Music Movement) he wanted to participate in the education of a new generation as a countermovement to the tattered political situation at Weimar Republic. He wanted music to be a part of many people's life. In contrary to middle-class culture Jugendmusikbewegung enhanced the status of amateur music. Eduard Zuckmayer conducts choir and orchestra of Schule am Meer on Juist Island Therefore, he followed a call of pedagogue Martin Luserke (1880‚Äì1968) to work as a music teacher at Schule am Meer, a progressive boarding school on Juist Island at North Sea. There he founded the school's choir and its orchestra which included all pupils.Eduard Zuckmayer: Jorinde und Joringel, lyrics by Hans Salm. B√ºhnenvolksbundverlag K. F. Koehler, Leipzig 1926. In this progressive school sports, music and community theatre were elementary. Musical education was regarded as bridging between the fine arts and life. With his pupils Zuckmayer went on several tours through Germany and got very positive reviews in contemporary newspapers. For one of his compositions his brother Carl visited the school to write the lyrics.Stiftung Deutsches Zentrum Kulturgutverluste, Magdeburg, Germany: Eduard Zuckmayer: Kakadu ‚Äì Kakada.University of G√∂ttingen, Germany:Eduard Zuckmayer: Kakadu ‚Äì Kakada.Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek: Eduard Zuckmayer: Kakadu ‚Äì Kakada.

Due to Antisemitism and \\"Gleichschaltung\\" (= Nazification) the school closed in spring 1934. Zuckmayer changed to Odenwaldschule, another progressive boarding school in Hesse. \\"Racial reasons\\" were mentioned when he became thrown out of Reichsmusikkammer (RMK) in 1935. = Turkey = He had to leave Germany in 1936 and migrated to Turkey, where Paul Hindemith (1895‚Äì1963) was already busy reforming the Turkish music education, assigned by the Turkish president Kemal Atat√ºrk. Hindemith mediated Zuckmayer's employment at the newly founded Music Conservatory of Ankara. There he met German colleagues like stage director Carl Ebert (1887‚Äì1980), conductor Ernst Praetorius (1880‚Äì1946) or violinist Licco Amar (1891‚Äì1959) and many others from German music and theatre who were forced to flee from Nazism. Initially he led the pupil's orchestra of Musiki Muallim Mektebi, where music teachers were trained. But in autumn of 1936 he got appointed as chorus leader of the drama play and opera division. He also became pianist of the Ankara symphony orchestra conducted by Praetorius and was deputy of Hindemith.

Jockisch and Zuckmayer had been colleagues at Schule am Meer on Juist Island. Gisela Jockisch and Eduard Zuckmayer lived together in Turkey but were not able to marry before 1947 because German authorities in 1938 neglected a certificate of no impediment to marriage (Ehef√§higkeitszeugnis) due to racist Nuremberg Laws (N√ºrnberger Gesetze). In 1938, the music branch of the teacher's college Gazi Eƒüitim Enstit√ºs√º (Gazi Institute for Education) was founded. Zuckmayer became its director of the music division which he held until 1970. He gave distinction to the Turkish music pedagogy. Until 1970 he trained nearly all Turkish music teachers (about 600 in total) who later taught throughout the country.Kurt Laqueur: Eduard Zuckmayer 75 Jahre, in: Mitteilungen, Vol. 62, 1965, Deutsch- T√ºrkische Gesellschaft e. V., Bonn, Germany, pp. 1‚Äì2. He integrated fundamentals of the German Jugendmusikbewegung into Turkish music pedagogy.

In 1940 his brother Carl wanted to help his brother to follow him to the United States with an affidavit of support where he already had migrated. He was worried about his safety since German troops were fighting in close range to Turkey in Greece as well as in southern regions of the Soviet Union. He contacted Hindemith in that matter.G√ºnther Nickel, Giselher Schubert (Ed.): Carl Zuckmayer ‚Äì Paul Hindemith. Briefwechsel, (= Zuckmayer-Schriften, Vol. 1), R√∂hrig, St. Ingbert 1998. In 1944 all German migrants were called upon by the Turkish government to leave Turkey. Eduard Zuckmayer refused ad got detained in Kƒ±r≈üehir detainment camp in Anatolia. Even there he very soon established a choir with whom he performed a mass by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina at Pentecost 1945. Hindemith who meanwhile had migrated to the US tried to intervene against Zuckmayer's detainment. He sent a telegram to Turkish president Ismet In√∂n√º but it was not successful. After the end of World War II Zuckmayer was able to leave the detainment camp and was reinstated to his former positions. He also taught music theory at Ankara Conservatory. Former Daimler-Benz chairman Edzard Reuter who lived in Turkey at that time described Zuckmayer as a \\"dignified and quiet man\\" who extinguished a \\"unique atmosphere\\" when he \\"sat down to play the piano\\".Citation from video clip of German TV documentation Eduard Zuckmayer ‚Äì Ein Musiker in der T√ºrkei (= A Musician in Turkey), 2:41 Min., 2017.

Later both migrated to the United States. Zuckmayer instead stayed at his place of activity. Even in old age he performed as concert pianist and conductor in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir. He had internalised the Turkish language as rarely another migrant. Since his entry to Turkey he had plead for translation of German folk songs to Turkish language. Meanwhile, they were integrated into Turkish music schoolbooks. He also transmitted Turkish folk tunes to polyphonic choral singing.Cornelia Zimmermann-Kalyoncu: Deutsche Musiker in der T√ºrkei im 20. Jahrhundert.

Originally dedicated to the martyrs Sergius and Bacchus, it was founded in the 6th century on rue Saint-Jacques Cadastre de Paris par √Ælot (1810-1836), plan 43e Sorbonne, √Ælots num√©ros 13 et 14, √©chelle 1/250, F/31/93/50 Le vieux Paris.

It was demolished in 1831 to build the th√©√¢tre du Panth√©on, which was itself demolished in 1854http://data.bnf.fr/16266870/theatre_du_pantheon_paris/ to build rue des √âcoles.  History According to Raoul of Presles the church was founded by Denis of Paris, who carried his head to its site after his execution, blessing the location, preaching a sermon on the Holy Trinity and dedicating it to \\"Beno√Æt Sire Dieu\\" (\\"Blessed be the Lord our God\\"). Its spelling changed over the centuries and so the church's dedication seems to have shifted to Benedict (in French \\"Beno√Æt\\") of Nursia. Traditionally the church's master builder mistakenly added its choir to the west end not the east, leading to its nickname of \\"le b√©tourn√©\\" (\\"the [church] turned the wrong way round\\"). Around 1280-1300 it is mentioned in Le Dit des rues de Paris by Guillot de Paris as Saint-Beneoit le bestourn√©. Francis I of France restored its usual name early in the 16th century and it then took the nickname \\"le bistourn√©\\" (\\"the twice- turned [church]\\"), later bowdlerised into \\"le bestourn√©\\", possibly to bring it back closer to its old name. One of the church's chaplains was Guillaume de Villon, tutor to Fran√ßois Villon, and Charles Perrault was buried in the church. In the Middle Ages the church housed an altar of Maturinus, patron of the mad and possessed, around which a devotion to him sprang up and to which many ill people were brought in hope of a cure. During the reign of Louis IX of France, the church's cloister housed a public market. He also granted the canons of Notre Dame de Paris a right to sell bread and wine in that market. The cloister's vast barns allowed the canons to store the grain and wine paid as dues to the canons. The church and its land were sold on 5 October 1791, 8 October 1791 and 30 September 1798.

It stars John Travolta, Michael Madsen, Shania Twain and Toby Sebastian. Principal photography began in August 2017 in Alabama. The film was released on February 22, 2019 to generally negative reviews from critics. Plot Sam and Cam Munroe are a father and son duo competing at the Talladega Short Track dirt race track. Sam is a local racing legend who now supports his son's racing in between dating divorcee Becca. Despite being a talented racer, Cam's car does not race well due to poor funding. Frustrated for losing the race due to engine issues, Sam's long-time rival, Linsky, offers Cam a chance to join his team with a new car. Cam decides to leave his father to join Linksy as a chance to prove his worth and win races. When Cam tells his father about his choice to join Linsky, Sam is enraged and warns that Linsky is a snake before firing his own son from the garage. Feeling down from Cam's defection, Sam spends the night drinking his woes away. By the following day, Sam decides to bring himself out of retirement and restore his status as a champion racer. While everyone thinks Sam is crazy to race so late in life, he quickly proves his experience and driving skills are still top notch and wins several races. With Sam reclaiming his title as champion racer, Linsky feels threatened by Sam and wants Cam to crash into Sam's car. Unable to crash into his father, Linsky has another racer stage a crash at the next race. Dunn causes Cam to spin out and Sam crashes into Cam's car onto the side. Although Cam survives his crash, he suffers multiple fractures on his leg and he is out of race for several months. In between these six months of recovery, Sam and Cam make peace with each other and Sam learns about Linsky wanting Cam to crash into him. With both cars severely damaged, they need a new car to get back into racing. Throughout this time, Sam has kept the 1970 Mustang that killed his wife. Because of sentimental value, he could never sell it. However, in order to buy a new dirt Late Model for Cam to drive, which costs about $80,000, Sam decides to sell his car to Linsky. Now devoting all his energy into building the new car, the Munroe family pools their efforts into getting the car ready and supports Cam's return to the circuit. Linsky wants to beat Sam to finally prove who is the better racer; he has to settle with racing Cam instead. During the race, Linsky spins out Cam in the final two laps of the race. Cam manages to restart his car and rallies from the rear of the field over the final two laps (which is quite unlikely) and wins the race. Linsky is denied his victory as Munroe won the race. When commenting about the race with the press, Cam gives credit to Sam and his loving wife for their support. In the aftermath, the Munroes celebrate Cam's daughter's first birthday. Cam has gotten a new apartment to settle the family in and Sam solidifies his relationship with Becca, having finally found happiness and peace with his life.

Members elect the Office Bearers at the AGM.Constitution of the EBA Aims and activities The association aims to generate the revival of electric boats, including innovation in both engineering and battery technology, lower wash hull design, alongside the setting up of an infrastructure of charging points hand-in-hand with the reduction of licence fees and a regular participation in both boat shows and rallies on the Thames, Norfolk, the Lake District and elsewhere. Publications The EBA members magazine ‚ÄúElectric Boat News‚Äù,Boatbuilding Academy has progressed to a full colour magazine and recently an online magazine. The EBA also publishes a Business Member's Directory & Product Guide Trade. Social media pages have also become important means of communication in recent years. Challenges and Records The Electric Boat Association promotes and encourages competitions and challenges.records The Solar Challenge Trophy was first established in 1997 and awarded that year to Malcolm Moss for his solar-powered channel crossing. The St David's Trophy was donated by the former speedboat racing champion, the late Fiona, Dowager Countess of Arran.(Obituary) The silver cup is awarded for \\"significant advance in the field of electric boating\\". Rear-Admiral Percy Gick presented the Emsworth Trophy to the Association in commemoration of the 600 mile cruise the Admiral and Mrs Gick made in 1978 in their cruiser \\"Electra of Emsworth\\". It is a great-crested grebe (the EBA symbol) in limewood carved and painted by Captain John Powell of Emsworth. The Emsworth Trophy is awarded to the EBA member whose boat completed the longest journey achieved during any consecutive four-month period in accordance with rules laid down and as determined by the committee. Mansura Perpetual Challenge Trophy, launched in February 2007, is for innovation in the design, development and operation of boats with hybrid or all electric propulsion systems. The bronze trophy, depicting the tiller head of the 1912 hybrid motor yacht Mansura, was donated by Julian Delmar-Morgan, grandson of the yacht's designer and owner, and David Barratt. Over the 2015 August Bank holiday weekend, Les Fidler of Westview Marina Earith achieved his personal challenge of cruising from Bedford to Denver Sluice (then the return trip to [Earith] ), a distance of over 100 miles on one charge. Annie, Les and Elaine Fidler's 27 ft cruiser has solar panels fitted to the roof to assist charging but the weather for most of the weekend included torrential rain and very little sun to be seen. In July 1997, 24 hour Endurance Record was set by EBA members Pat and Paul Wagstaffe M.B.E. in their 29 ft launch ‚ÄòWagtail V‚Äô. Organised by EBA business member Thames Electric Launch Company, the record was established covering 116 miles in 24 hours on a single charge over a measured stretch of the River Thames near Goring. Four years later, Richard and Anne Leeson, EBA members, offered their classic 1899 Andrews river launch ‚ÄòPike‚Äô for an Endurance Record attempt.

From 2018 they have been known as West Wales Raiders, the name of the club based at Stebonheath.

History =2006‚Äì2008: Origins= Many professional and semi- professional Welsh teams have played rugby league in the otherwise English competitions since the formation of the Northern Union in 1895. The latest attempt to expand the game to South Wales began when the Crusaders joined the National League Two in 2006. The club was initially based in Bridgend. The idea of a second professional side in Wales was discussed before the Celtic Crusaders had even played a game. The Crusaders' plan was to help a Rugby League Conference Welsh Premier club join the National Leagues to act as a feeder club if Crusaders reached Super League. The idea was also talked about in mid-2009 when Rugby Football League decided that Super League Reserves would be turned into an under-20 competition, a move that could have halted the development of rugby league players in the area after they turned 21 years old. The formation of the South Wales Scorpions was accelerated after the Crusaders left South Wales and moved to Wrexham F.C.'s Racecourse Ground. South Wales RLFC were formed by a consortium of businessmen led by Phil Davies in late 2009. They were accepted into Championship One the third tier of British rugby league for the 2010 season. =2009‚Äì2015: South Wales Scorpions= Several suggestions for a team moniker were made by various people.

The initial badge in 2009 The initial batch of players were selected from an open trial plus a few signings from other clubs. Some players were dual-registered with Crusaders RL and had played for the Crusaders reserves. Before a ball had been kicked, the club celebrated its first international players, Loren Quick and Lewis Reece, who played for Wales and Great Britain at under-18 level. Anthony Seibold, who had been an assistant coach at Crusaders, was the first head coach. The Scorpions' first ever competitive game was against Workington Town on 28 February 2010, who also provided the competition for Celtic Crusaders' first match in the 2006 National League Two competition. The Scorpions won this encounter 22‚Äì20, in front of a crowd of over 500 at the Gnoll; with stand-off Lloyd White, on a months loan at South Wales from Crusaders, landing the crucial penalty goal to secure victory. The team went on to finish sixth in the table and made the play-offs. Seibold returned to Australia at the end of the season. Wales Rugby League, agreed to take over the running of South Wales Scorpions for the 2014 season after Phil Davies decided to step down. Professional rugby league returned to the Bridgend county borough as Scorpions moved to Maesteg RFC.

The Israel Police began investigating Netanyahu starting in December 2016. Police recommended indictments against Netanyahu, and on 21 November 2019, Netanyahu was officially indicted for breach of trust, accepting bribes, and fraud. As a result of the indictment, Netanyahu is legally required to relinquish his ministry portfolios other than prime minister. Netanyahu's trial in the Jerusalem District Court began on 24 May 2020. Overview * Case 1000, officially opened in December 2016, involves valuable presents and gifts received by Netanyahu and his wife throughout the years from several wealthy acquaintances. * Case 2000 deals with recorded conversations Netanyahu had with Arnon Mozes, chairman and editor of Yedioth Ahronoth, one of the largest newspapers in circulation in Israel. During these conversations, Netanyahu and Mozes discussed legislation that could harm Yedioth's major competitor, Israel Hayom. * Case 3000 does not directly involve Netanyahu, but, rather, people with professional and personal ties to Netanyahu, in connection to a deal made between Israel and Germany for the purchase of three Dolphin-class submarines and four Sa'ar 6-class corvette warships. * Case 4000 relates to telecommunications company Bezeq's relationship with its regulator, the communication ministry, at the time headed by Netanyahu. * Case 1270 was an offshoot of Case 4000, involving an alleged appointment bribe offer to an Attorney General of Israel candidate, in exchange for dropping a case against Netanyahu's wife. On 21 November 2019, Netanyahu was officially charged of deception and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 2000, and of deception, breach of trust, and receiving bribes in case 4000. =Case 1000= In case 1000, Netanyahu has been charged with having had a conflict of interest when, in the capacity of Minister of Communications, he handled affairs related to the business interests of Arnon Milchan. Over the course of 20 years, Netanyahu received from Milchan, and from a friend of Milchan's, James Packer, expensive cigars and champagne, worth $195,000, and jewelry for Netanyahu's wife Sara costing $3,100. The charges cite three separate incidents in which Netanyahu assisted Milchan. In the first, Netanyahu contacted US officials regarding Milchin's visa to the US. In the second, in 2013, Netanyahu discussed with then-Finance Minister the possibility of extending the period of an investment tax break that would help Milchan (the tax break was not extended). In the third, Netanyhu directed an official of the communications ministry to provide information to Milchin regarding a merger of Milchin's telecommunication companies. =Case 1270= Case 1270 related to a suspicion that Netanyahu's former media advisor offered District Court president Hila Gerstel an appointment to the vacated Attorney General of Israel, in exchange for closing a case against Netanyahu's wife, an offer Gerstel refused. The case has been compared to the \\"Bar-On Hebron affair\\" in 1997, during Netanyahu's first term, involving the appointment of Roni Bar-On to attorney general. In January 2019, the case was closed for lack of evidence. =Case 2000= The two largest newspapers in circulation in Israel are Yedioth Ahronoth and Israel Hayom. Israel Hayom is owned (either directly or indirectly) by Sheldon Adelson, a personal friend and benefactor of Netanyahu. Israel Hayom is often criticized by the political left for portraying Netanyahu in an overly positive light. Meanwhile, Yedioth is often criticized by the right for being unfairly negative towards Netanyahu. Netanyahu and the editor of Yedioth, Arnon \\"Noni\\" Moses, held conversations discussing passage of legislation that would close Israel Hayom in exchange for Moses's hiring journalists who would steer the paper to being more favorable to Netanyahu. The legislation received support from left-wing parties but failed due to opposition from Netanyahu's coalition. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust in the case; Mozes has been charged with attempted bribery. =Case 3000= Netanyahu is not a suspect in Case 3000. Three Dolphin-class submarines and four Sa'ar 6-class corvette were purchased from the German company ThyssenKrupp by Israel. The suspicion in this case refers to swaying the deal in ThyssenKrup's favor for the personal gain of several of the people involved. Netanyahu's cousin and personal lawyer David Shimron, who represented the German company in Israel, is one of the main suspects. =Case 4000= Case 4000 involves the communication conglomerate Bezeq. The investigation investigated, among other issues, whether falsehoods were made with regards to paperwork leading to favorable business dealings for Bezeq owner Shaul Elovitch in exchange for favorable reporting to Netanyahu by Walla!. The Israeli Police recommended on 2 December 2018 that bribery charges be brought against Netanyahu and his wife. On 21 November 2019, Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit officially brought charges against Netanyahu of fraud, breach of trust, and receipt of bribes. Protests Several events have followed the investigations as they had widespread implications. As of September 2017, protesters have held Sunday rallies in Petah Tikva for 41 consecutive weeks to protest what they claim as interference with the investigations by the Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Rallies have also been held in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square to protest government corruption, even in the midst of the Covid19 crisis, where demonstrators stood the required two meters apart and wore masks. Supporters of Netanyahu (mainly Likud party members) organized counter protests. In early August 2017, leader of the coalition David Bitan began calling to arms the members of the Likud party, first in the form of the counter protests in Petah Tikva, later by threatening any party member who won't stand behind Netanyahu of \\"getting even\\" in the next primary season, and finally in a large rally to show support. The rally was held in Tel Aviv and had a wide showing of the majority of the Knesset members from the Likud party. During the rally Netanyahu gave a controversial speech, accusing the media of being a part of a left wing coalition and plotting against not only him, but the entire right wing. Opponents of Netanyahu argued that this was baseless, first because he is being investigated personally, as opposed to the entire Likud party, and because both Roni Alsheikh (Chief of the Israeli Police) and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit were appointed by Netanyahu himself. Since then, Netanyahu has consistently attempted to denigrate the justice system and the police in an effort to discount the charges against him, culminating in a speech made outside the courtroom on 24 May 2020, before attending his first trial session. Indictment On 19 December 2018, Israeli State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan recommended to Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit that Netanyahu be indicted. On 20 December 2018, Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he would \\"work quickly\\" on the case, but \\"not at the expense of quality decisions and professionalism\\". On 28 February 2019, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected a motion filed by Netanyahu's Likud Party to stall the publication of the Attorney General's recommendations. The same day, Mandelblit announced that he had accepted police recommendations to indict Netanyahu on three of the charges and that the indictment will officially go into effect following a hearing. The hearing took place in October 2019, and on 21 November, Netanyahu was indicted in cases 1000, 2000, and 4000 for charges including breach of trust, accepting bribes, and fraud. As a result of the indictment, Netanyahu was legally required to relinquish of his ministry portfolios other than Prime Minister. =Immunity bid= Netanyahu submitted a request for immunity to the parliamentary speaker, Yuli Edelstein, on 1 January 2020. Many MKs, including Avigdor Lieberman of Yisrael Beiteinu, Benny Gantz of Blue and White, and Stav Shaffir of the Green Party, were critical of the move. Lieberman called for the Knesset to bring back committees that had been dissolved (and also indicated that his party would vote against a bid for immunity); without a Knesset committee, there would be no action on Netanyahu's immunity until after the March election. According to The Times of Israel columnist Raoul Wootliff, the election had in effect become a race to gain enough seats so that Netanyahu can successfully request immunity from over half of the MKs. Knesset legal advisor Eyal Yinon ruled on 12 January 2020 that there was no impediment to forming a Knesset committee that could prevent Netanyahu from receiving immunity. If his immunity bid was not accepted, his trial could begin. There was a vote the next day establishing a House Committee that would debate immunity for Netanyahu; it was approved 16 votes in favour to five against. The committee included 30 members, with a majority from parties opposed to Netanyahu. As a result, Netanyahu withdrew his bid for immunity on 28 January 2020; the charges against him were thus officially confirmed and filed in Jerusalem District Court on the same day. Prelude to the trial On 18 February 2020, the Justice Ministry announced that Netanyahu's trial would start in the Jerusalem District Court on 17 March 2020. On 9 March 2020, Netanyahu filed a motion to delay the trial for 45 days. On 10 March, the court rejected this bid and affirmed the original trial date. However, on 15 March 2020, the beginning of the trial was pushed back until 24 May as a result of coronavirus-related restrictions. The Jerusalem District Court ordered Netanyahu to appear in person at the opening of his trial. Trial The trial began on 24 May 2020 in courtroom 317 of the Jerusalem District Court, in front of judges Rivka Friedman-Feldman, Moshe Bar-Am, and Oded Shaham, with Friedman-Feldman as the presiding judge. The prosecutors are Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, who serves as lead prosecutor, Yonatan Tadmor, Deputy Chief of the Tel Aviv District State Attorney's Office Economic Crimes Division, and Yehudit Tirosh, Director of the Securities Department of the Israel Securities Authority. Netanyahu's defense team initially consisted of Amit Hadad, the chief of the defense team, and Micha Fettman. Fettman left the defense team following the first hearing and was replaced by Yossi Segev. Following the second hearing, Boaz Ben-Tzur joined the defense team. For the first hearing, Netanyahu was present along with three other defendants in his corruption cases, Shaul Elovitch, Iris Elovitch, and Arnon Mozes. The opening session of the trial, which is referred to in Israeli jurisprudence as the \\"reading\\", saw the judges read out the charges to Netanyahu and the others, and the defendants confirming that they understood them, after which the defense attorneys, prosecutors, and judges discussed the timing of the start of the evidentiary stage of the trial. During the first session, Netanyahu was granted the right to avoid a second in-person court appearance for the next session, which was scheduled to be held on 19 July 2020. It was reported that Netanyahu's next in-person court appearance would not happen until the evidentiary stage of the trial began, which would not start for several months, possibly not until 2021. The second hearing happened as scheduled on 19 July. The hearing was a procedural deliberation to determine whether the prosecution and defense had examined the investigative materials and to determine the timing of the start of the evidentiary stage and number of hearings per week. Netanyahu's defense requested a delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Presiding judge Rivka Friedman-Feldman rejected the defense's request and ruled that the prosecution would begin presenting its case in January 2021, with witnesses to testify three times a week, and that Netanyahu would have to attend. On 26 July, the court announced that the trial's preliminary hearing would take place on 6 December, and Netanyahu would be obligated to attend. On 15 September, the prosecution summoned 90 witnesses to appear at the evidentiary phase of his trial.

She was the daughter of Sir James Cecil Hogg K.C.V.O., an ear specialist whose patients included Queen Elizabeth II. She was the fashion editor of Harper's & Queen between 1974 and 1979, and then co-founded the World of Interiors in 1981, which became one of the most influential shelter magazines of the late 20th century. She died in June 2019. Early life Georgina Hogg was born in London in 1939, and grew up in Regent's Park. Her father was a personal physician to the Queen, with a surgery on Harley Street. She was a boarder at Benenden School and then went on to the Central School of Art and Design to study graphic design with Terence Conran. Hogg was one of the girlfriends of John Huston, with his daughter Anjelica recalling how Hogg lent her high- heeled shoes to help her practise her modelling walk. Career Conran's wife, Caroline, who was already working at Queen, asked Hogg to come and join the magazine as a typist. This was her first job, introducing Hogg to journalism as a career. Hogg briefly left to write for The Observer on interior decor and architecture, and was also a photographer's agent for a while, but in 1974, returned to the team of Queen (now rechristened Harpers & Queen) as a fashion editor. Hogg eventually succeeded Jennifer Hocking as chief fashion editor, much to the frustration of Hocking's assistant, Anna Wintour, who had wanted the role. However, Willie Landels, the editor of Harper & Queen, stated that he employed Hogg because she was intelligent and articulate, and unusually for a fashion editor at the time, was able to both speak well and write well. Hogg stayed on at Harper & Queen until 1979. She then went on to become fashion editor for Sheba, an Arabic-language magazine aimed towards the wives of Middle Eastern oil barons. Hogg was founding editor of World of Interiors, and held the role for 20 years from 1981 to 2001. The magazine, originally titled Interiors, proved so successful that within six months of its launch in November 1981, Cond√© Nast made an offer to purchase it. In June 1982, Cond√© Nast eventually purchased a half-interest, and the magazine was renamed World of Interiors to avoid conflict with another American magazine also called Interiors. Whilst Cond√© Nast already owned a similarly conceived publication, House & Garden, the company felt that World of Interiors offered an exclusive up-market image to appeal to those seeking escapism and fantasy, whilst House & Garden was more accessible and that the titles would be complementary, rather than rivals. By December 1983, World of Interiors had a circulation of 52,000 issues per month, with 7,000 per month in the United States and many notable subscribers, including Jacqueline Onassis, Paloma Picasso, and Bill Blass. In 1983 alone, the advertising revenues had risen by 68 percent from 1982. Under Hogg's direction, the magazine promoted interiors that used historical textiles and artefacts to create a romantic and rarefied effect, although she stated that she was simply doing whatever pleased her. In 1983 she described her approach as celebrating homes personalised by their residents, rather than interiors created by professional decorators, and stated that she wanted to promote eclecticism, vintage style, and individualism, and not modernism or minimalism. In June 1999, the New Statesman commented that Hogg's 18 years in the post made her a typical example of the longevity of Cond√© Nast's editors. Later life Until her death in 2019, at the age of 80, Hogg continued travelling in pursuit of inspiration, with homes in London and the Canary Islands. As of 2017, she worked as a wallpaper designer in collaboration with Nicholas Haslam.

Life  All that we know of his life comes from biographical details in the Dit and its context. A man of letters, possibly a scribe, he was not a high-ranking poet. At the start of Dit he states he had edited several other texts: \\"Maint dit a fait de Roys, de Conte, Guillot de Paris en son conte\\" (lines 3 and 4). He demonstrates a poetic touch in his concise and color-filled descriptions of the streets of Paris. He lived in the reign of King Philip III of France (1245-1285), a time when the population of Paris was growing fast, requiring construction of a succession of enclosing walls ringing the city. In 1300 the population of Paris might have been 200 000 including the faubourgs, G√©rard has estimated. Dit A minor work of great importance for its portrayal of the Paris of the period, Dit was first published in 1754 by , who discovered the manuscript in Dijon in 1754.The reference version was produced by in 1875 after carefully reviewing the text against the manuscript preserved in the Bibliotheque nationale de France, and enriching it with notes, a glossary and preface. A long poem of 554 verses of eight syllables in an AABB rhyme scheme, Dit enumerates the streets of Paris, approaching them through the neighborhoods which then made up the capital: to the north the Rive Droite (right bank), Outre Grand-Pont (\\"Beyond Great Bridge\\"), also called the City, to the south the Left Bank, Outre-Petit-Pont (\\"Beyond Little Bridge\\"), also known as the University, and on the island, √éle de la Cit√©, the cradle of Paris. Influence Guillot offers tasty descriptions for each of the 310 streets of Paris of the time, small scenes in few words, used like brush strokes to show the sellers of wheat and cloth, the butchers, tailors, armourers and goldsmiths, and even the prostitutes and footpads. Some of these streets have disappeared but most of them have not, even if in 700 years some of them have changed in name or appearance, or part of their original span has been amputated. In the history of literature, the perambulations of Guillot, who takes his readers into the streets of the great Parisian labyrinth, foreshadow the genre of the Parisian urban stroll, which reached its apogee in the 19th century in the writings of G√©rard de Nerval such as Nuits d'octobre (October Nights) and M√©moires d'un Parisen (Memoirs of a Parisian), as well as in Charles Baudelaire's Fleurs du mal and Spleen de Paris (Petits po√®mes en prose).

Life Enright was born in West Maitland into a Catholic family, with an Irish background. He grew up among Aboriginal people around the Port Stephens district. He graduated with honours in geology and French in 1893, Professor Edgeworth David was an important early influence from those days until Enright's death. Professionally he qualified as a solicitor and went into practice in West Maitland. He was a member of numerous learned societies. Building on his familiarity with Port Stephen natives, he developed a more scholarly approach after reading the works of R. H. Mathews, on behalf of whom he carried out extensive work in his particular region of interest. In the 1930s he introduced himself to A. P. Elkin, then at Morpeth, asking him for help in organising his research, which had been focused on the Worimi, in terms of anthropological method, since he himself had not the time to acquire the relevant methodologies of analysis. Numerous joint forays into the field followed, as Enright introduced Elkin to informants whom he thought would prove useful. Elkin subsequently published a paper on the Worimi, acknowledging Enright's assistance and wrote a laudatory obituary on the latter's demise.

History It was built in 1831 on the remains of the √©glise Saint-Beno√Æt to designs by Alexandre Bourla and commissioned by √âric Bernard, an actor at the Od√©on. It opened on 18 March 1832 with Un panorama, a vaudeville by Thomas Sauvage. Bernard gathered a cast of a dozen actors alongside whom he put on nearly fifty shows in a single year, but such a high turnover took its toll on his health and he passed its management to MM. Georges and Pierre Perrin fils in February 1833. They put on the first appearances of Mademoiselle Judith, which proved promising, but even so the new managers gave up after only two months. The theatre reopened on 1 September 1835 under the management of Tard, who brought in a totally new troupe of actors. He was so successful that Tard was offered the management of the Od√©on in 1836. He was replaced at the Panth√©on in September 1836 by the playwright Th√©odore Nezel, who shifted the theatre's output towards comedy. In April 1839 Nezel handed the theatre over to one of his troupe, Dubourjal, who took on Aline Duval, who had jumped ship from the th√©√¢tre Comte ‚Äì she was so successful that she was in turn taken on by the manager of the Palais-Royal. After a financial dispute, Dubourjal was dismissed in April 1841 by the theatre's owner. In September the actor Oscar Pichat was made the theatre's manager, but he resigned in February 1842, to be replaced by its owner Houy, who then managed it until April 1843. Its last two managers, Blachard and Braux, were also actors ‚Äì they made one final attempt to revive the theatre's fortunes in September 1843, but in vain. On their departure, the government revoked the theatre's licence and closed it permanently. The building was finally demolished in 1854 to build rue des √âcoles.

It was planned to generate 150 MW of electricity after it was completed in 2020. Storage capacity would have been up to 8 hours at full power. The facility was expected to produce 495 GWh of electricity annually. It was to be north of Port Augusta on Carriewerloo Station. On 5 April 2019, South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan announced the cancellation of the project. Timeline The premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill announced on 14 August 2017 that construction would commence in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2020. It was expected to cost to build, including a loan from the Federal Government. SolarReserve has a contract to supply all of the electricity required by the state government's offices from this power project. The plant received formal development approval from the state government on 9 January 2018. At that time, finance was not yet all in place, but SolarReserve still anticipated commencing construction in mid-2018 and taking 650 workers two and a half years to build it. On 5 April 2019, South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan announced that he had been contacted by SolarReserve who said the project would not be going ahead. In December 2019, local South Australian renewable energy company 1414 Degrees () announced it had acquired the project from SolarReserve, along with SolarReserve's early-stage solar PV projects in NSW. 1414 Degrees renamed the site Aurora Solar Energy Project, indicating it would develop the site as a solar photovoltaic farm firmed up using their proprietary GRID-TESS thermal energy storage system using molten silicon. In May 2020, it announced that the first stage would open in mid-2021 with 70MW of solar panels, followed by a pilot Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS). Reasons for cancellation Tim Buckley, the Director of Energy Finance Studies for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said that the most likely reason for the cancellation was a lack of revenue certainty for the technical demonstrator project. The Aurora plant had the capability of firming up variable renewables by providing stored power from hot salt after the sun had gone down and solar photovoltaic panels had stopped generation. But no long-term contract was on offer to provide for a fixed price for electricity from the plant, particularly during the evening peak hours of 6 pm to 8 pm. This was due to lack of a government policy framework and to a lack of time of day electricity pricing. South Australian opposition leader Peter Malinauskas blamed the failure to secure finance on the state government's plan to establish a new electricity interconnector to New South Wales. This interconnector was expected to reduce the peak wholesale cost of electricity.

The Polish partisans from AK, WiN and BCh, captured in the vicinity ‚Äì but also transported there from afar ‚Äì like the soldiers of the 27th Home Army Infantry Division, were executed across the vast area of the forest spanning well over a dozen hectares. Mass graves were planted over with small pine trees by the killers. A symbolic cross was erected on site by some people in the summer of 1945. Removed by the Communist officials, it was often replaced by the locals under the cover of night. The number of people murdered at Uroczysko Baran is unknown. Even the number of mass graves has not been established to this day. After fifty years of Communist rule in Poland, the closely guarded site is now overgrown with mature trees. Partial documents found in the archives of the Polish Army prove only 43 official executions, and 144 military court convictions, but the Soviet archives are either inaccessible, or no longer existing. Soon after the end of totalitarianism in Poland, the Institute of National Remembrance interviewed 110 witnesses. There was only one forensic exhumation conducted at Uroczysko Baran. The human remains were reburied at a local cemetery in KƒÖkolewnica in 1990. The IPN branch in Lublin states that some 2,000 anti-communist resistance fighters were detained in local prisons by the Stalinist security forces between 1944 and 1956, including 450 of the most prominent so-called \\"cursed soldiers\\". J√≥zef Franczak witnessed some of the killings. After Soviet troops entered the area, he was conscripted into the Polish Communist 2nd Army stationed in KƒÖkolewnica, where the military court was located. Franczak deserted in January 1945 and became a cursed soldier. He was shot dead in 1963. Also in: And: At KƒÖkolewnica, and at the Uroczysko Baran, hundreds of detainees died without a trial. According to witnesses, military trucks covered with tarpaulin travelled back and forth between the two locations until November 1945, day in and day out.

The stated purposes of the Congress of Russian Americans include preservation of Russian culture in the United States, protecting the rights of Russian-Americans, fighting Russophobia, and improving relations between the Russian and American people.  History  The Congress of Russian Americans (CRA) was founded in 1973 by Russian immigrants to the United States, including white √©migr√©s from the Russian Empire, who were opposed to communism. The original intention of the CRA was to prevent russophobia on the basis of Western anti-communism during the Cold War by advocating the distinction between the Russian national identity and Soviet communist ideology. In 1978, the Russian-American Chamber of Fame was founded in order to honor Russian immigrants who provided outstanding contributions to American science and culture, including television pioneer Vladimir K. Zworykin, the 1973 Economics Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief, the founder of Tolstoy Foundation Alexandra Tolstaya, and many other notable.European Russians: The place of Russian Emigration in US Science and technologyCRA Hall of Fame Since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, the CRA has extended its goals to include encouraging cultural and economic development in Russia, and aiding persecuted Christians and human rights activists within former Soviet states. The Congress of Russian Americans is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and maintains a liaison office in Washington, D.C. for interaction with the United States government and other organizations. The CRA's known initiatives include attempts to nullify the Captive Nations law, which they regard as anti-Russian rather than anti-communist, since the list of \\"captive nations\\" did not include Russians despite being the first nation to fall to a communist regime.

Kurdistan Region and Syria are neighbors, but Kurdistan Region only borders PYD-held Rojava since the Syrian civil war. Kurdistan Region and Syria share two border-crossings, and in late-July 2017, 244,605 Syrian refugees lived in Kurdistan Region. The number rose to 247,347 in January 2018 and to 249,842 in January 2019. History Due to the strained relations between Syria and Iraq under Hafez al-Assad and Saddam Hussein respectively, Assad supported Kurdish rebels in Northern Iraq as they fought Iraqi forces. In 1975, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan was established in Damascus by Jalal Talabani and the Syrian regime established formal ties with Kurdistan Democratic Party in 1979, as Idris Barzani visited Damascus. Damascus tried to unite the various Iraqi Kurdish fractions against the Iraqi regime and offices for both parties were opened in Qamishli. When the Syrian civil war reached the Kurdish areas of North Syria in 2012, President of Kurdistan Region Masoud Barzani gathered the various Kurdish factions of Syria in Erbil to unite them against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Many Syrian soldiers of Kurdish origin deserted at the early stages of the Syrian civil war and fled to Kurdistan Region to form \\"Rojava Peshmerga\\" which is funded by Kurdistan Region. Kurdish Foreign Minister Falah Mustafa Bakir stated that: \\"We want to a see a democratic and representative government in Damascus, and the opposition must take into consideration the recognition, rights and future of all the minority groups.\\" In 2015, Syrian MP Sharif Shahada visited Erbil, where he mentioned that Barzani declined to visit Damascus back in 2011. Responding to the Kurdistan Region's independence referendum in September 2017, Syrian MP Riyaz Taus stated that Syria did not support the referendum, because it was a unilateral decision without Baghdad's consent. Advisor to the Council of Ministers Said Azzouz also echoed that any unilateral action will be rejected and that Syria cannot accept the division of Iraq. Furthermore, he stated that independence needed legal provisions from the Iraqi constitution. In August 2017, Syrian Minister for Tourism Bishr Yaziji visited Erbil to strengthen tourism ties.

The first such law took effect in 1844, when the Provisional Government of Oregon voted to exclude black settlers from Oregon's borders. The law authorized a punishment for any black settler remaining in the territory to be whipped with \\"not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes\\" for every six months they remained. Pages 132‚Äì135. Additional laws aimed at African Americans entering Oregon were ratified in 1849 and 1857. The last of these laws was repealed in 1926. The laws, born of anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, were often justified as a reaction to fears of black people instigating Native American uprisings. Timeline A 1903 map of Oregon's territory Early white settlers in the Oregon Country often held both anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, and many came from states, such as Missouri, which had some version of exclusion laws. White settlers believed banning slavery would eliminate political controversy, but feared that settlements of freed slaves would compete for power with white people. One early migrant wrote that Oregon pioneers \\"hated slavery, but a much larger number of them hated free negroes worse even than slaves.\\" In 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon established a set of organic laws, including a ban on slavery: \\"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\\" Enforcement of the law was left unclear. After a vote on June 26, 1844, the first Black Exclusion law reiterated a ban on all slavery in Oregon territory, while also forcing black and mulatto settlers to leave Oregon territory within three years (two years for men), or else to be whipped \\"no more than 39 times.\\" This section was amended in December 1844 to permit a free slave to be resold on the condition that the slave owner agree to remove them from the territory at the end of the contract, which was held with the provisional government. In effect, this re- established slavery on a temporary basis for three years. The law was repealed in 1845, having never been invoked. On September 21, 1849, the US territory established its second exclusion law, declaring a ban on \\"any negro or mulatto to enter into, or reside\\" in Oregon unless already established there. At least four black people were punished under this law, including Jacob Vanderpool, a sailor, and three others who were eventually permitted to stay. An 1850 census showed fewer than 50 black residents in the state of Oregon, including a mixed-race man from Pennsylvania, George Washington Bush, who was forced to move North of the Columbia River after the first exclusion Law was passed. George Washington, another unrelated free man, was the founder of Centralia, Washington. On April 16, 1852, Robin Holmes, a black slave of Nathaniel Ford, brought a case to the territorial Supreme Court, charging that he and his family were being held by Ford illegally. Holmes v. Ford was heard by four judges, culminating in Judge George Henry Williams' June 1853 ruling that slavery was illegal in Oregon. Descendants of Holmes have since stated that Ford had encouraged the lawsuit as a means to bring an end to slavery in the state. On November 7, 1857, Oregon's delegates to the state Constitutional Convention submitted proposals to legalize slavery and to ban black people from the state, including a ban on signing contracts or owning land. The slavery amendment failed, but the exclusion law passed. Oregon was the only state admitted to the Union with such an exclusion law. There are no records that this law was enforced, and the legislature voted down a proposed 1865 law that would authorize sheriffs to deport black residents in their counties. 1844 law and amendments Peter Hardeman Burnett circa 1860 The Cockstock Incident was a major factor in the passage of the first black exclusion law. It centered on a fight between a Wasco Native American man, Cockstock, and a free black man, James D. Saules, over ownership of a horse. The argument escalated into a melee that killed three men, and led to rhetoric among white settlers that African-Americans could create an uprising among local Native American tribes against settlers. On June 24, 1844, within days of the Cockstock Incident, the Oregon Provisional Legislature suspended its rules to allow Peter Burnett to propose a bill \\"for the prevention of slavery\\" without reference to a committee. The bill was read twice and voted into law the following day. The bill contained methods of enforcement for the prevention of slavery, which had already been banned in the territory. These laws included a three-year limit on all free black people, and required freed slaves to leave the state within two years, if male, and three years, if female. The initial law proposed \\"no more than 20\\" lashings by whip for slaves found in violation of the law, which was amended in December 1844. A week after the law's passage, Burnett wrote in a personal letter that the bill was intended to \\"keep clear of that most troublesome class of population.\\" Decades later, Burnett publicly described the Exclusion Law as intended to prevent disenfranchised black people from being exposed to politically empowered white people, which he wrote \\"reminds them of their inferiority,\\" and suggested that their presence was \\"injurious to the dominant class itself, as such a degraded and practically defenseless condition offers so many temptations to tyrannical abuse.\\" The law had an unknown impact on black people in the state, and no records suggest it was ever enforced. =Text of 1844 law and amendments= Though the official text of the original law has been lost, it was reprinted in several sources at the time. The law as described contained eight sections, and two amendments were added in December 1844. The Oregon exclusion law prohibited free black men and women in the territory, though jurisdiction for the law was limited to the region south of the Columbia river. Section 1 > That slavery and involuntary servitude shall be forever prohibited in > Oregon. Section 2 > That in all cases where slaves shall have been, or shall hereafter be, > brought into Oregon, the owners of such slaves respectively shall have the > term of three years from the introduction of such slaves to remove them out > of the country. Section 3 > That if such owners of slaves shall neglect or refuse to remove such slaves > from the country within the time specified in the preceding section, such > slaves shall be free. Section 4 > That when any free negro or mulatto shall have come to Oregon, he or she (as > the case may be), if of the age of eighteen or upward, shall remove from and > leave the country within the term of two years for males, and three for > females, from the passage of this act, and that if any free negro or mulatto > shall hereafter come to Oregon, if of the age aforesaid, he or she shall > quite and leave the country within the term of two years for males and three > for females, from his or her arrival in the county. Section 5 > That if such free negro or mulatto be under the age aforesaid, the terms of > time specified in the preceding section shall begin to run when he or she > arrive at such age. Section 6 > That if such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country, as > required by this act, he or she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by > some justice of the peace, and, if guilty upon trial before such justice, > shall receive upon his or her bare back not less than twenty nor more than > thirty-nine stripes, to be inflicted by the constable of the proper county. Section 7 > That if any free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country within the > term of six months after receiving such stripes, he or she shall again > receive the same punishment once in every six months, until he or she shall > quit the country. Section 8 > That when any slave shall obtain his or her freedom, the time specified in > the fourth section shall begin to run from the time when such freedom shall > be obtained. December amendment > Be it enacted by the Legislative Committee of Oregon as follows: > Section 1: That the sixth and seventh sections of said act are hereby > repealed. > Section 2: That if any such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit and > leave the country, as required by the act to which this is amendatory, he or > she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by some justice of the peace, and > if guilty upon trial before such justice ... the said justice shall issue > his order to any officer competent to execute process, directing said > officer to give ten days' public notice, by at least four written or printed > advertisements, that he will publicly hire out such free negro or mulatto > from the country for the shortest term of service, shall enter into a bond > with good and sufficient security to Oregon, in a penalty of at least one > thousand dollars, binding himself to remove said negro or mulatto out of the > country within six months after such service shall expire,; which bond shall > be filed in the clerk's office in the proper county, and upon failure to > perform the conditions of said bond, the attourney prosecuting for Oregon > shall commence a suit upon a certified copy of such bond in the circuit > court against such delinquent and his sureties. 1849 law In September 1849, the legislature passed another exclusion law, with a preamble arguing that \\"it would be highly dangerous to allow free negroes and mulattos to reside in the Territory or to intermix with the Indians, instilling in their minds feelings of hostility against the white race.\\" The 1849 law ordered any black people entering the territory to leave within 40 days. It was applied in 1851 to Jacob Vanderpool, a West Indian who had migrated to Oregon City. A white resident of the city brought a case against Vanderpool, who was arrested and ordered to leave Oregon within 30 days. The family of Abner Hunt Francis were ordered out of the state within 40 days, but were allowed to stay after a petition was signed by 225 citizens. The petition formed the basis of a failed coalition to amend the exclusion law to allow for good behavior bonds by black settlers. The Francis family moved to Canada in 1861. A petition was also used in 1854 to prevent the deportation of Morris Thomas and Jane Snowden. Oregon's congressional delegate, Samuel Thurston, while seeking to limit federal land grants to white people, described the law to congress: \\"The negroes associate with the Indians and intermarry, and, if their free ingress is encouraged or allowed, there would a relationship spring up between them and the different tribes, and a mixed race would ensue inimical to the whites; and the Indians being led on by the negro who is better acquainted with the customs, language, and manners of the whites, than the Indian, these savages would become much more formidable than they otherwise would, and long and bloody wars would be the fruits of the commingling of the races.\\" The law was repealed in 1854. 1857 law Title page of the Oregon state constitution, 1857 In 1857, Oregon voters had supported statehood for Oregon and subsequently called for a constitutional convention. The emergent constitution contained 185 sections, 172 of which were copied from various other state constitutions, with the additions primarily racial exclusion or finance related. The document enshrined an Exclusion Law into Section 35 of the Bill of Rights within the Oregon State Constitution. The article read as follows: > No free negro or mulatto not residing in this state at the time of the > adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside or be within this state or > hold any real estate, or make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; > and the legislative assembly shall provide by penal laws for the removal by > public officers of all such negroes and mulattoes, and for their effectual > exclusion from the state, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring > them into the state, or employ or harbor them. John R. McBride, later a state senator, described the amendment: \\"It was largely an expression against any mingling of the white with any of the other races, and upon a theory that as we had yet no considerable representation of other races in our midst, we should do nothing to encourage their introduction. We were building a new state on virgin ground; its people believed it should encourage only the best elements to come to us, and discourage others.\\" The question of slavery itself was put to a popular vote, with the public voting against slavery (by a vote of 7727 to 2645) but in favor of racial exclusion policies (by a vote of 8640 to 1081). The final state constitution denied \\"negroes, mulattos and Chinamen\\" from voting or owning land. Repeal Oregon's racially discriminatory state constitutional amendment, Section 35, was legally invalidated after the Civil War by the ratification of the 14th Amendment to the federal Constitution in 1868. However, Section 35 remained formally on the books for another 58 years. In 1925, the Oregon legislature proposed the formal repeal of Section 35, adopted as House Joint Resolution 8 (1925). The measure was referred to Oregon voters as a 1926 ballot initiative which was approved with 62.5% in favor. Measure 14 in 2002 removed the racist language in the constitution but 29% of Oregon voters elected to retain the racist clause in the constitution. =Legacy= From 1850 to 1860, Oregon saw its black population increase by just 75, compared to an increase of 4,000 in neighboring California. Oregon's black exclusion laws have been linked to a below-average black population ‚Äì two percent ‚Äì into the present day constitution. Historian Cheryl Brooks has proposed that Oregon's small black population has made it difficult for Oregonians to recognize racial discrimination problems in the state.

He is a former Crown Court Recorder, member of the Parole Board of England and Wales and a tutor judge of the Judicial College. In March 2013 he was one of the judges appointed to hear an inquest into the death of Olaseni Lewis. Early life Beddoe came from a military family. He was born in Abyad, Egypt, where his father, World War II veteran Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Beddoe was serving at the time of his birth. His father had a very distinguished military career and before his posting to Egypt was an infantry battalion commanding officer in Welsh Regiment during the Second World War. Judge Beddoe takes pride in his Welsh heritage. Career at the Bar Beddoe was educated at Tonbridge School and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was called to the bar as a member of Gray's Inn in 1979 and thereafter practised as a barrister at 36 Bedford Row chambers where he practised from 1980 specialising in prosecution work, including prosecution of several cases of fraud, tax evasion, organised crime and murder, until 2005, when he was appointed Standing Counsel to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office. He served in that capacity until December 2007, when he was appointed circuit judge. =Standing Counsel to HMRC= Beddoe served as a Standing Counsel to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office for 3 years, until December 2007, dealing with numerous high level drug importations and diversion cases, including some of the largest fraud prosecutions in the country such as the largest diversion fraud ever prosecuted at the time. =Prosecutor= Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in Peterborough Crown Court, Cambridgeshire. Throughout his career he successfully prosecuted many criminal cases including prosecution of a fraudster who was found guilty of involvement in a ¬£1.5 million fraud in 2002, and a solicitor who plead guilty to stealing ¬£350,000 in fees from clients in 2005. Solicitor Christopher McChrystal was arrested in October 2004 after the Law Society referred his case to the police. McChrystal was subsequently struck off after Lincoln Crown Court's finding that he used the clients' money to make an investment into his business. In 2003 Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in court cases resulting from Operation Harrier, a clean-up operation which has declared all-out war against Class A drugs in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. =Defence counsel= Beddoe has defended at the criminal bar in drug cases, fraud, homicide and other serious crime. He also dealt with Courts Martial, Inquests and Public Enquiries. In 2005 he successfully defended Jason Smith, British soldier who served eight years in the British Army. The court heard that Smith's successful Army career was halted prematurely due to a back injury and he had struggled to come to terms with it. In March 2005, as a result of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Smith had carried out a raid of a petrol station in Northampton at knife- point, but later dropped 45 in cash as the owner and several villagers gave chase. Sentencing Jason Smith to a two-year suspended sentence, Judge Nigel Daly told him: Judicial career As a judge, Beddoe has presided over many high-profile criminal cases, including trial of BAFTA nominated film producers who used Film Tax Credit to claim back inflated cash from the Treasury. =Judicial appointments= In 2007 His Honour Judge Beddoe became the Resident Judge on the South Eastern Circuit based at Southwark Crown Court Beddoe was a Recorder of the Crown Court from 2002 until 2007, when he was appointed a Senior Circuit Judge, becoming the Resident Judge on the South Eastern Circuit based at Southwark Crown Court. =Notable cases= In 2017 Judge Beddoe presided over the case of Ricardo McFarlane, 30-year-old Muslim convert charged with anti-social behaviour after preaching Sharia law in Oxford Street and two other London venues, who declined to stand up in court on religious grounds. McFarlane allegedly breached the terms of an antisocial behaviour order barring him from addressing members of the public to promote sharia law. At the hearing in Southwark Crown Court, Judge Beddoe noticed that McFarlane did not stand when he entered the room. McFarlane's defence barrister commented: To which Judge Beddoe responded: McFarlane then proceeded to stand for Judge Beddoe while he was speaking and during the rest of the hearing. Charity In May 2017 Judge Beddoe was a lead walker at the London Legal Walk organised by London Legal Support Trust, which was designed to bring together leading criminal practitioners to raises funds for charities that provide life changing legal advice and representation to those in need. It was attended by leading criminal practitioners and professionals working in the criminal justice system, including Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, Nicholas Hilliard QC, Recorder of London, and Lord Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. In June 2006 Beddoe cycled in the London to Brighton British Heart Foundation cycle rally to raise money in memory of a member of his former chambers, Paul Morgan, who died in 2005 of heart disease at the age of 50.

Due to the quantity, quality and variety of artifacts discovered, it has become a type site for the dating of J≈çmon period remains in the southern T≈çhoku region. It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1968. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 4000 to 2500 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan, and the rocky ria coast of Miyagi Prefecture was densely settled from the early through late J≈çmon period. The Daigigakoi Shell Midden is located on the south shore of Matsushima Bay, at an elevation of approximately thirty-five meters from the present-day coastline. The midden is very large, extending for 270 meters east-west and 280 meters north-south, in a roughly horseshoe shape, indicating continuous usage over thousands of years. It is over two meters thick in places. In the central clearing, the remains of at least eight pit dwellings have been found. A preliminary survey was conducted intermittently from 1917-1918, 1925 and 1927-1929. More comprehensive excavations were conducted in 1949, 1963 and 1965 by Tohoku University; and again from 1972-1981. Many of the artifacts found are housed in a local museum at the site. It is located about 10 minutes by car from Geba Station on the JR East Senseki Line.

USCIS, colloquially known as the H-1B Lottery Lawsuit, was a class action lawsuit brought against United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, challenging the lottery process used to decide which cap-subject H-1B Form I-129 petitions to adjudicate in case more petitions were received than the cap for the fiscal year. The plaintiffs were two pairs of H-1B petitioner (employer) and beneficiary (prospective employee). The case was decided against the plaintiffs, and an appeal was withdrawn after both plaintiffs withdrew. Background =Legislative caps= The H-1B visa was introduced in its present form by the Immigration Act of 1990, with an annual cap of 65,000 for temporary skilled workers. The quotas apply for each fiscal year that begins in October of the previous calendar year. Form I-129 petitions can be filed at most six months in advance of the start date, so the start date for filing petitions for a given fiscal year is April of the preceding calendar year. The most recent legislation changing the caps was the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 (passed 6 December 2004), which added 20,000 cap- exempt slots for workers with United States Master's degrees. =Lottery process= The USCIS published a regulation in the Federal Register on 5 May 2005, describing its process for deciding which of the H-1B Form I-129 petitions it received in a given fiscal year it would adjudicate, while staying within the legislatively determined cap of 65,000 + 20,000. The regulation stated that all petitions \\"before\\" the date of crossing the cap would be adjudicated, whereas petitions received on the day of hitting the cap would be subjected to a lottery to select just the right number that would hit the cap. USCIS would not accept further petitions in that fiscal year. Moreover, petitions where the beneficiary had a U.S. Master's degree would be counted against the 20,000 limit first, and if that limit was hit before the 65,000 general limit, further such petitions would be counted against the 65,000 limit. Petitions that were submitted later, or that were submitted on the last date and did not win the lottery for the last date, would get no preferential treatment in later years. During the 2008 fiscal year, the USCIS received enough cap-subject petitions to hit its cap within the first two working days of April, and had to put all petitions through a lottery to select which ones to adjudicate. To reduce pressure on overnight courier services and USCIS service centers, USCIS changed its selection process effective fiscal year 2009: it would now receive cap-subject petitions for at least the five working days of April, and, if it received enough petitions in that period, it would stop receiving applications and select petitions to adjudicate by putting all received petitions through a lottery. Unselected petitions in a given year continued to not receive preferential treatment in subsequent years. =Related FOIA lawsuit= On 20 May 2016 (two weeks before Tenrec v. USCIS), the American Immigration Lawyers Association, with help from the American Immigration Council, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against USCIS, seeking more transparency into the H-1B lottery process. USCIS responded on 1 August 2016, with three affirmative defenses. Case =Original lawsuit= On 2 June 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), challenging the H-1B lottery process. The plaintiffs were two pairs of petitioner (prospective employer) and beneficiary (prospective employee), where the beneficiary had not been selected in the H-1B lottery process: * Tenrec, Inc. for beneficiary Sergii Sinienok (from Ukraine) * Walker Mary LLC, for beneficiary Xiaoyang Zhu (from China) The plaintiffs were represented by the law firm Parrilli Renison, with attorney Brent Renison the point of contact. On 29 June, the complaint was amended to add claim for failure under the Administrative Procedure Act. On 7 July, a class certification was filed, seeking to represent all employers and employees hurt by the H-1B lottery. A motion for summary judgment was also filed, asking the court to rule in favor of the plaintiffs and have an orderly lottery. =Motion to dismiss= On 8 August 2016, USCIS filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On 22 September 2016, Michael Simon, a judge at the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, denied the USCIS motion to dismiss the lawsuit. =Decision= Between October 2016 and March 2017, there were several iterations of amended complaints, motions to dismiss, and answers. During this time, one of the original plaintiffs, Tenrec, Inc. and employee Sergii Sinienok, withdrew from the lawsuit, so that Walker Mary LLC and Xiaoyang Zhu were now the lead plaintiffs. On 17 March 2017, judge Michael Simon made the Oregon District Court's final decision against the plaintiffs, so that the fiscal year 2018 lottery (that would be held in April 2017) could proceed as planned. The plaintiffs timely appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on 4 April, but on 23 June, the case was dismissed after the plaintiffs withdrew as the lead plaintiffs won the lottery in fiscal year 2018 and no other willing lead plaintiff was found.  Reception  Writing for National Law Review, Cassie Ramos noted that while the lawsuit highlighted problems with the H-1B lottery, the proposed solution of using a waiting list suffered from its own problems, without a way for the employees in the waitlist to continue to stay and work in the country. Instead, the author proposed that the cap gap for Optional Practical Training be made flexible so that it could be extended by a year for anybody who did not get through the H-1B lottery. The article highlighted the importance of increasing caps in addressing the underlying issue.

Caroline A. Lowe (1874‚Äì1933), generally known as Caroline Lowe, was a 20th-Century Canadian-American labor and civil liberties lawyer and Socialist activist for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).  Early life  On November 28, 1874, Lowe was born as Caroline Lowe in Cottom, Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Lowe's family descended from British loyalists from the American Revolutionary War. Lowe's father was an itinerant lumberjack. Lowe grew up in Oskaloosa, Iowa. At age sixteen, Lowe moved to Kansas City, Missouri. Career Lowe taught school for many years and became president of the Kansas City Teachers Association. In 1903, she joined the two-year-old Socialist Party of America in Kansas. As of 1908, she had become a Socialist organizer in Kansas. She worked as a Socialist field worker with miners and their families in Nebraska coal towns. She became a popular Socialist speaker. By 1911, she had become chairwoman and general correspondent of the party's Woman's National Committee. In 1918, she was admitted to the bar and practiced in Girard, Kansas. In January 1918, she helped defend IWW member Charlies Krieger in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fred Moore led the defense team, assisted by Lowe and George Bonstein of Tulsa, in Krieger's first of two trials. Krieger was charged with felony for destroying a building with explosives. The trial began in October and received coverage from as far away as Seattle. During April to August 1918, she supported George Vanderveer in the Chicago trial of 101 \\"Wobblies\\" (IWW members), including co-founder Bill Haywood. In 1919, the IWW sent her to New York City to help Carl Recht on deportation cases occurring in Seattle, Washington: 53 IWW aliens were being sent to Ellis Island for deportation. These deportation efforts arose from the 1919 Seattle General Strike, handled by IWW defender George Vanderveer. Recht and Lowe wrote a 200-page report on their findings, which they presented to Immigration and Labor representatives: they saved some 30 from deportation. On February 10, 1919, she gave a speech entitled \\"The Disillusions of Democracy\\" at an IWW People's Council fundraiser in New York City. In December 1919, she co-defended 28 Wobblies in Kansas City, Kansas. In March 1918, a Wichita, Kansas grand jury had accused them of violating the Espionage Act and the Lever Act for interruption of petroleum flow. Legal flaws led to a special grand jury in June 1919, which indicted them again under the Espionage and Lever Acts. Despite the efforts of the defense team (Lowe, George Vanderveer, Fred Moore, and Otto Christensen), the jury found 26 guilty (after one of the 28 pled guilty and the last remained at large). Sentence ranges from three to nine years in prison.

The amber is dated between Late Eocene and Early Miocene, and suggested to be contemporaneous to Baltic amber. Major exploration and mining of the amber did not start until the 1990s. Geology The late Eocene amber is hosted in the Mezhigorje Formation, with early reports of occurrences in the underlying Obukhov Formation as well. The formations are found along the northwestern margin of the Ukrainian Crystalline Shield exposed in the Rivne region of the Ukraine and across the border near Rechitsa in the Gomel Region of Belarus. The granite basement rock was overlain by sandy to clayey deposits that were host to alluvial amber. The two formations total between in thickness, both containing interbeds or mixtures of brown coals and carbonized vegetation. Both formations are sandy to clayey in texture, with the Obukhov having more clayey glauconite-quartz plus sandy loess, while the Mezhigorje is mostly medium to fine grained sands of a greenish gray tone, and with occasional iron impregnation and layering. Prehistoric use Small amounts of rough, partially worked, and fully shaped amber have been recovered from Paleolithic and Neolithic sites in the Dnieper area. At a site near Mezhyrich, four large mammoth bone huts attributed to Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens included over 300 pieces of amber attributed to Rovno origins. Many of the amber pieces are roughly fashioned into triangular and circular shapes. Dating of the site ranges between 13,300 and 10,500 B.C., when the regions of Baltic amber deposits in Kaliningrad and Lithuania were still covered with ice-sheets. A small female statuette of carved amber was found near Dobranichevka, while a disc with a central hole, and a hunting scene carved on one side was found in a Globular Amphora culture tomb in the Dubno district of Ukraine. Mining The main use of amber until the 20th century was for burning, and rarely was it shaped for crafts. As such, before the 1990s amber recovery wasn't overseen by the Ukrainian government, with small amounts found after rains and thaws and during well construction and while the Kiev-Kovel rail line was being built. Small scale collecting of the amber started to gain momentum in the 1950s when granite deposits in the Klesov area were beginning to be developed. At that time the amber was picked from drainage piles and tailings dumps of the granite quarries, often limited in access by the quarry operators. Following an increase in the amber for jewelry production in Kiev, Lithuania, and Poland, during the 1970s investigation and eventual start of the Pugach quarry in Klesov culminated in 1991. In 1993 the Ukrainian government first started state overseen mining, under the auspices of Ukrburshtyn and at the same time making other major amber mining illegal. The current mining, centered on the Pugach quarry is operated by Burshtyn-Ukrainy. Since 2014 and the breakdown of law and order following the Euromaidan, 90% of Ukrainian amber is extracted illegally and the trade is controlled by armed organised crime groups. The amber is extracted by pumping water into the sandy sediments forcing the amber to the surface, creating pits. Areas where the amber is found are often covered in pine-beech forest, which is illegally deforested to extract the amber. Annual volumes of amber extracted illegally are suggested to be around 300 tons. Composition Amber from the Klesov deposit and others in Ukraine have up to 0.1% Fe giving many pieces yellow-brown and brownish red tones to the amber, though nearly crystal clear to totally opaque are found as well. Rare pieces have light green to pale green coloration, which typically fades to yellow after a year or two in the small pieces. However, larger pieces of green amber between are more stable in color and have not faded after a decade. Most of the amber from the Keslov area has an oxidization crust between thick and brown to dark brown in coloration. Amber from the Vol'noe area northwest of Klesov often show a smooth transparent dark yellow crust, which is rarely seen in Klesov specimens. Similar to Baltic amber, Rovno amber is viscous in plasticity and unaltered pieces of both have a density of 0.98‚Äì1.13 g/cm3. Infrared spectroscopy of the amber shows carboxyl, hydroxyl, peroxide, and complex ester functional groups and additionally single and double bonds in the molecular structure are present placing Rovno amber in the succinite range, same as Baltic amber. Trace amounts of Pb, Y, Zn, Zr, and some other elements are present in Rovno amber. Small to no detectable amounts of those elements are detected in Baltic amber. Paleoecology Extinct hopper Alicodoxa rasnitsyni nymph There are a number of arthropod taxa, ranging from planthoppers, such as Alicodoxa, and ants to mites and spiders that are shared between Rovno and Baltic amber. As of 2016 there were 193 ant species described from Priabonian age European ambers, with all but 56 of the species being found in or described originally from Baltic amber, while Rovno amber hosts 31 of the 56 species that are not known from Baltic amber. Based on the differences in ant fauna between Baltic amber and Rovno amber, it has been suggested by Perkovsky that the two were different areas of a large forest that covered Late Eocene to early Oligocene Europe. The spiders of Rovno amber are similar to Baltic amber ones, but there is a notable percentage that are unique species not shared between the two. Similarly the gall midges from Rovno amber are entirely unique to Rovno and not shared at all with the Baltic amber. A drier climate for the Rovno forest is also suggested based on the high percentage of the Collembola families Entomobryidae and Sminthuridae, 59.7% and 24.5% respectively of the Collembola fauna. Baltic amber fly families have a distinct percentage of families associated with aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, such as Chironomidae, while the Rovno fly fauna includes nearly double the amount of Sciaridae, Tipulidae, Mycetophilidae and other families associated with leaf litter habitats, called the \\"Sciara\\" zone.

Life  Helmut Erich Johannes Lehmann was born in Berlin. His father was a writer. He attended school in Strasbourg and Berlin and then between 1897 ad 1899, undertook an apprenticeship in carpentry at Sch√∂neiche, a small town just outside Berlin on its eastern side. Between 1900 and 1903 he was employed first as an assistant in a lawyer's office and then with a health insurance organisation (Krankenkasse). In 1900 he joined the national office workers' trades union (\\"Zentralverband der B√ºroangestellten\\") and from then till 1900 was also working as a trades union official at the union's Berlin office. In 1903 Lehmann joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). In 1903 he became a department head at the AOK health insurance office at Berlin where he worked, a position he retained till 1907. In 1904 he established and became chairman of the League for Apprentices and Young Workers in Prussia. Between 1905 and 1913 he contributed as an editor to the \\"Deutsche Angestellte Zeitung\\" (\\"German Clerical Workers' Newspaper\\") and he was also active as an author and producer of publications for the health insurance organisation. During these years, between 1907 and 1914, he was secretary for the Union of Office Workers (\\"Verband der B√ºroangestellten\\"). In 1918/19, during the year of revolutions that followed national military defeat, Lehmann participated as a member of the Soldiers' and Workers' Soviet in Dresden. Between 1914 and 1924 he was secretary of the National Association of German Health Insurance Organisations, based at one stage in Dresden, moving on to serve as the Berlin-based executive chairman of the National Association between 1924 and 1933. The position meant that he was able to exercise a powerful influence over the development and expansion of Germany's health insurance system, and he also became increasingly influential as a social policy strategist within the SPD, of which he had been an active member since 1903. Everything changed in January 1933 when the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Although Communist activists were at the top of the government hit list, others with a record of activism in the SPD and the union movement also attracted the attention of the authorities. Lehmann was deprived of his offices and almost at once arrested, spending time in government detention during March/April 1933. In June 1935 he was again taken into \\"investigative custody\\", identified as the leader of a resistance group in Berlin comprising members of illegal organisations: Social Democrats and Trades Unionists. A few years later the assassination plot against Hitler failed in its primary objective but succeeded in making the government acutely nervous. They dusted down a pre-prepared plan and on the night of 22/23 August 1944 mass arrests took place across Germany in an exercise identified as \\"Aktion Gitter\\". What the people arrested had in common was that before 1933 they had been listed as active politically, usually as members of the Communist Party, the SPD or the trades union movement. Many of those sought, especially Communists, had long since fled abroad. Others had died, sometimes simply of old age. But that still left more than 4,000 who were arrested: Hans Lehmann was one of these. In January 1945 the special People's Court sentenced him to a year in prison for \\"Backing the enemy\\" (\\"Feindbeg√ºnstigung\\"). He was released from Berlin's Tegel Penitentiary on 22 April 1945 as the Soviet army took possession of what remained of the city. The end of the war marked a return for Lehmann to mainstream politics in what was administered, between May 1945 and October 1949, as the Soviet occupation zone. During May and June 1945 Lehmann worked with the economy department in the Berlin municipal quarters of Pankow and Wedding. Then, through July 1945, he served as deputy chief of the Social Security Establishment for Greater Berlin, a position from which he moved on to create the National Administration for Labour and Welfare Affairs (\\"Zentralverwaltung f√ºr Arbeit und Sozialf√ºrsorge\\") in the zone relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, retaining responsibility within that organisation as a vice- president of it till 1950. In June 1945 Lehmann became a member of the SPD party central committee. He was one of those participating in the party conference of April 1946 at which the SPD and the Communist Party voted, applying processes that would remain contentious, for a merger which resulted in the creation of a new party, the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). The architects of the process evidently hoped to find a way for the merger to apply across the four occupation zones into which the western two thirds of Germany had been divided in 1945, but in the event the party merger only took effect in the Soviet occupation zone, and by the time the Soviet zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic the SED was well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. From the outset Helmut Lehmann was a senior figure within the new party, appointed to the Party Executive in 1946, and remaining a member between 1949 and his death in 1959 after the Party Executive became the Party Central Committee. Under the Leninist constitutional structure being created, power rested not with any parliament or government ministers but with the party central committee, though the fact that the same individuals were frequently members of more than one of the institutions involved made the Central Committee's dominance less stark than it might otherwise have been. Not all Central Committee members carried equal weight. The Central Committee was directed by the country's leadership through its Politburo. Lehmann was a Politburo member during 1949/50. Working in a commission chaired by Anton Ackermann, he was one of those who worked on drafting the Basic principals and objectives of the new party. The focus of Lehmann's political interest remained, as it has been before 1933, social welfare, and several of his additional appointments reflected this. In 1946 he was appointed president of Volkssolidarit√§t (\\"People's Solidarity\\"), an organisation for older citizens integrated, like various other official mass organisations, into the national political power structure in a supportive capacity. He was chairman between 1950 and 1958/1959 of the National Executive for Social Insurance (\\"Zentralvorstandes der Sozialversicherung\\"). One authoritative source defined his role more succinctly as being \\"Head of Social Insurance\\" (\\"Chef der DDR-Sozialversicherung\\"). He also held senior positions in the Trades Union Federation. At a regional level he sat as a member of the Landtag of Thuringia between 1946 and 1949. At the national level, during 1949/50 he was a member of the provisional national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). According to some sources he then remained a Volkskammer member till his death in 1959.

By 1918, they had clashed with the local American Legion after the burning of a first IWW union hall in 1938. The IWW re-opened in a second location. Elmer Smith was a local lawyer, sympathetic to the IWW. A pacifist, he strongly encouraged union members to pursue a non-violent course and to try to reach a peaceful arrangement with the other residents of Centralia. He also reached out to the governor to attempt to get him to intervene to prevent a vigilante raid. The landlady for the hall and Britt Smith (no relation ), the local IWW secretary, contacted law enforcement and asked for protection, but were told nothing was possible. The Wobblies then printed and widely distributed a flier calling on the people of Centralia to take action. None of these efforts yielded any response. With this being the case an extra-legal raid on the Wobbly hall seemed likely. With attempts at a peaceful compromise unsuccessful, local IWW leader Britt Smith pressed Elmer Smith for additional advice. Elmer Smith agreed that it would be legal for the Wobblies to physically defend themselves, but, as he later testified, only in self-defense if attacked first. The IWW members interpreted this legal advice as justification to arm themselves for what they perceived as an inevitable and dangerous confrontation. During Smith's trial the following year for his part in the Centralia Massacre, prosecutors would present this advice as proof that the IWW had planned the massacre.\\"Visited I.W.W. Hall with Elmer Smith at Noon on November 11th\\", Chronicle (Spokane, WA), February 16, 1920 However, considering Elmer Smith's strong belief in non-violence and seeming good character, it is doubtful that armed conflict was his objective. The true intent of Smith's recommendation will probably never be known. After the massacre (in which six people were killed), officials arrested Smith, although he had participated in the massacre. Later, he was acquitted and released. He died before Governor Clarence D. Martin (1884‚Äì1955) commuted sentences.

History The mansion was where Gurun Princess Kejing lived after her marriage to a member of the Mongolian Borjigin clan. The Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars meant that the territory now known as Mongolia was unsafe for a Qing princess, so the Kangxi Emperor decreed that she should reside in Hohhot, then known as Guihua City ().

It is laid out symmetrically east-west, with the central axis from south to north featuring a spirit screen, main entrance, ceremonial entrance, main hall (called Jingyi Tang ÈùúÂÆúÂ†Ç), a house-style passage (), bedchamber, and a rear building (). Each of the four internal courtyards and buildings along the central axis is flanked by opposing side buildings. The building is only one storey high and the walls are very thick to protect against the cold winters experienced in Hohhot. The main hall has traditional latticed windows, whilst the bedchamber has windows set high into the wall that can be opened.

The specific name picta is from Latin and means \\"painted.\\" It is the only species in the monospecific genus Delphinia. It is found in the United States on the East Coast and in the Midwest from Florida to Maine across to Kansas through Minnesota but also can be found in Mexico and El Salvador. It is sometimes mistaken for a species of fruit fly, but D. picta do not feed on living plant matter, as they are detritivores and eat decaying plant matter. They also have been observed eating fermenting frass from Megacyllene robiniae on black locust trees. They can be found almost anywhere there is decaying vegetation: landfills, temperate deciduous forests, swamps, and even shaded fields. Description The best way to identify the species is by the distinct pattern on its wings, which are shiny and dark brown with a hyaline background. Its body is about 7mm long with a black abdomen and a light brown head, thorax, and legs. The ovipositor averages 1.27mm long with two dorsal and one ventral prominent pairs of setae, as well as many short setae on both sides. The tip of the ovipositor also has a slight bend downward. Life cycle Adults raised in the lab usually live less than 40 days, but can live up to 69 days. Mating takes place in the evening two days after emergence from pupae. The female will wave her wings gently and a male will respond by flicking his wings before copulation. Courtship may also include one or more of the partners blowing a bubble from their mouth. Females will lay up to 500 eggs in decaying herbaceous plant matter, which then hatch into larvae in 4 to 6 days. Larvae develop through three instar stages and reach pupae in 21‚Äì30 days then finish pupating 14‚Äì17 days later. The development is affected by the amount of daylight: D. picta is a multivoltine species with one generation going from May to July and the other overwintering as mature larvae. Ecology Among the plants it associates with are black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). It is prey for wasps, such as Crabro monticola.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built by Pandyan ruler Parakkirama Pandian during the 13th century, with later additions from Madurai Nayaks. Shiva is worshipped as Kasi Viswanathar and his consort Parvathi as Ulagamman. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4 - 8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Maasi Maham festival during the Tamil month of Maasi (February - March) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, a Pandya king Parakkirama Pandian wanted to construct a temple for Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam, an iconic representation of Shiva in South India. Shiva appeared in his dream and asked him to follow the army of ants. The next day he found that there was an army of ants. The king realised that it was because of the divine intervention that he was prevented from going to Varanasi. He built the temple in the place where the anthill ended. History Pillared hall leading to the sanctum Tenkasi was established during the early 13th century CE. There are inscriptions in the temple dated 1384 from the period of Vira Pandiya mentioning the gift of houses and villages to Brahmanas to recite Vedas and Purana in the temple. Between 1428 and 1460, a Pandya king Parakkirama Pandian ruled the southern part of Madurai region, comprising the modern day Tenkasi and it surroundings. There was contrasting dates on the rule of Parakkirama Pandya, with some mentioning the year as 1309, while the inscription in the temple indicating as 1309. Tenkasi was a part of Madurai region during the 16th century. Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks and the temple started receiving gifts from the rulers of the dynasty. The temple had a flat tower till 1967, when a 180-foot artistically built temple tower was initiated and completed in 1990. Architecture Tenkasi is built around the Kasi Viswanathar temple. The temple has a seven- tiered gopuram (temple tower) and has concentric granite walls that enshrines all the shrines in the temple. The temple has a pillared hall from the entrance leading to the flagstaff hall. The sanctum is located axial to the entrance facing east. The image of Kasi Viswanathar in the form of lingam is housed in the sanctum. The images of Vinayaka and Subramanya are located on either side of the hall leading to the sanctum. The shrine of Sivakami is located parallel to the sanctum facing East. There are smaller shrines of Dakshinamurthy, Arumugar, Durga, Navagrahas and Nataraja in the precinct around the shrines of Kasi Viswanatha and Visalakshi. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi.

She was also a philanthropist who assisted weavers in Bedworth to emigrate following the collapse of the local ribbon-weaving industry in the 1860s. Biography Nona Maria Stephenson Bellairs was born into a large family. Her mother was Dorothy (Mackenzie) Bellairs, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter in the West Indies, and her father was the Rev. Henry Bellairs (1790-1872), who was at various times in his career rector of Bedworth in Warwickshire, vicar of Hunsingore in Yorkshire, and an honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral. Bellairs wrote several travel books that doubled as botanical guidebooks, the first of which, Going Abroad (1857), was set in France and Italy. Her hybrid approach is evident in this extract from the book's table of contents: \\"Nice ‚Äî The English Church ‚Äî Asplenium Trichomanes ‚Äî Mentone ‚Äî A Country Carnival ‚Äî Cheilanthes Odora\\". Her guidebook and memoir Hardy Ferns (1865) was a product of the later stages of the Victorian craze for collecting ferns. Bellairs called for protection of ferns, some of which were becoming very rare due to overcollecting, writing: \\"The poor Ferns, like the wolves in olden time, have a price set upon their heads, and they in like manner will soon altogether disappear. We must have 'Fern laws', and preserve them like game.\\" She also wrote at least two novels, the first of which, Redmarsh Rectory (1859), may have been inspired in part by her experiences as the daughter of a minister. Her second novel, Strength and Weakness (1867), was a story of factory life. Critics generally praised her writing as refined and pleasant. In Bedworth, where her father was rector, the ribbon-weaving industry collapsed in the 1860s. Bellairs is remembered for her great efforts assisting local jobless weavers and their families to emigrate to Australia.

Post-World War II anti-fascism, also known as antifa groups (), anti-fascist movements and anti-fascist action networks, saw the development of political movements describing themselves as anti-fascist and in opposition to fascism. Those movements have been active in several countries in the aftermath of World War II during the second half of the 20th and early 21st century. History  =Europe= Germany The historical seat of the Communist Party of Germany (Karl-Liebknecht-Haus) with prominently displayed logo of the Antifaschistische Aktion, 1932 Antifa The post-war history of the anti-fascist movement in Germany includes two distinct traditions, an East German tradition and a tradition that arose in West Germany during the 1970s, both drawing inspiration from the earlier Antifaschistische Aktion of the Weimar Republic. According to German government institutions the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Federal Agency for Civic Education, the contemporary Antifa or anti-fascist movement in Germany‚Äîthe terms are often used interchangeably in German‚Äîis composed of multiple far-left, autonomous, militant groups and individuals who describe themselves as anti-fascist. The use of the epithet fascist against opponents and the understanding of capitalism as a form of fascism are central to the movement. According to political scientist and Christian Democratic Union politician Tim Peters, the term anti-fascism is primarily used by the far left in contemporary Germany. In Communist East Germany, \\"anti-fascism\\" as interpreted within the Communist movement was part of the official ideology and language of the Communist state, and the original Antifaschistische Aktion (\\"Anti-Fascist Action\\") of the Communist Party of Germany was considered an important part of the heritage of the governing Socialist Unity Party of Germany; Eckhard Jesse, director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism, notes that the term \\"anti-fascism\\" was ubiquitous in the language of the East German Communist party, and used to justify repression such as the crackdown on the East German uprising of 1953. \\"Antifascism\\" in East Germany generally meant the struggle against the western world and NATO in general, and against the western-backed Federal Republic of Germany and its main ally the United States in particular, which were seen as the main fascist forces in the world by the East German Communist party. For example, from 1961 to 1989, the East German regime used the term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Wall\\" () as the official name for the Berlin Wall.Berlin Wall: Five things you might not know, The Telegraph, 11 August 2011 The modern Antifa movement ultimately has its origins in West Germany, in the student-based Au√üerparlamentarische Opposition (extra-parliamentary opposition) of the 1960s and early 1970s which opposed the alleged \\"fascism\\" of the West German government.Grunenberg, Antonia (1993). Antifaschismus ‚Äì ein deutscher Mythos. Freiburg: Rowohlt. . Major factors that formed the backdrop of this movement were criticism of the Vietnam War and the United States, students' anti-authoritarian rebellion against their parents' generation, criticism of professors' dominance of universities and continuity of the societal relations of power, especially the continuity in the civil service since the Nazi era, and the criticism of the centre-left SPD by those to the left of the SPD. The modern movement largely adopted the aesthetics of the Antifaschistische Aktion during the late Weimar Republic, including the abbreviated name Antifa and a version of its logo, while being ideologically somewhat dissimilar. The first Antifa groups in this tradition were founded by the Maoist Communist League in the early 1970s. From the late 1980s, West Germany's squatter scene and left-wing autonomism movement were the main contributors to the new Antifa movement and in contrast to the earlier movement had a more anarcho-communist leaning. The modern movement has splintered into different groups and factions, including one anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist faction and one anti-German faction who strongly oppose each other. German government institutions describe the contemporary Antifa movement as part of the extreme left and as partially violent, and Antifa groups are monitored by the federal office in the context of its legal mandate to combat extremism; the federal office states that the underlying goal of the Antifa movement is \\"the struggle against the liberal democratic basic order\\" and capitalism. Romania The Anti-Fascist Committee of German Workers in Romania was an organization for ethnic Germans in Romania. Emmerich Stoffel was the chairman of the Committee and Philipp Geltz its secretary. The committee was based in Bucharest and published the newspaper Neuer Weg ('New Path'). By the late 1940s the post-Second World War wave of discriminations against the German minority in Romania had subdued. At its meeting in December 1948, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party adopted a 'Resolution of the National Question' which outlined the need for the formation of a German Anti-Fascist Committee and a German-language newspaper. The Anti-Fascist Committee of German Workers in Romania was founded in March 1949 by a number of ethnic German party members, along with its organ Neuer Weg. The committee was tasked with mobilizing support for the communist government amongst ethnic German labourers. The committee was one of a number of ethnic mass organizations in Romania at the time, alongside the Jewish Democratic Committee, Union of Slav Democratic Cultural Associations, the Hungarian Popular Union, the Democratic Committee of the Russian and Ukrainian Peoples, the Democratic Greek Committee and the Democratic Armenian Committee. Sweden: Antifascistisk Aktion activities Militant anti-fascism emerged in Sweden in the early 1990s, in particular around the yearly November 30 protests in Lund and Stockholm propelled by blockades of neo-nazi marches in both cities in 1991. The main militant antifascist group in the country was the Antifascistisk Aktion (AFA), founded in Sweden in 1993 with as many as 20 branches in the late 1990s. It was inspired by a group with the same name that had started in Copenhagen in 1991 and British groups with similar names from the 1980s. The early tactics mainly focused on large demonstrations, in particular blockades of marches inspired by the 30th November events in Lund between 1991 and 1993. In parts of Sweden where these actions were less anchored in memory culture, a more territorial repertoire of interpersonal violence instead dominated, particular in the late 1990s. It was in this period that AFA published a detailed Activity Guide describing tactical uses of violence against neo-Nazis. In the early 2000s Antifascist Action split, with the now defunct, more Marxist and Workerkist Revolution√§ra Fronten (The Revolutionary Front) forming out of remnants of its Gothenburg, Stockholm and √ñrebro branches. Since the late 2000s the type of militant street-based antifascism that AFA and Revolution√§ra Fronten represented has declined, in response to a more parliamentarian and online focus in the far right. This is evident by the very limited public role in many of the largest antifascist demonstrations in the 2010s, including the large 2018 Gothenburg blockade of the Nordic Resistance Movement, the massive K√§rrtorp protest, and the massive 13.000 person strong demonstration in 2014 in response to the stabbing of Showan Shattak and three other antifascists in Malm√∂. United Kingdom: against the NF and BNP After World War II, Jewish war veterans in the 43 Group continued the tradition of militant confrontations with Oswald Mosley's Union Movement. In the 1960s, the 62 Group continued the struggle against neo-Nazis. In the 1970s, fascist and far-right parties such as the National Front (NF) and British Movement (BM) were making significant gains electorally, and were increasingly bold in their public appearances. This was challenged in 1977 with the Battle of Lewisham, when thousands of people disrupted an NF march in South London. Soon after, the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) was launched by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). The ANL had a large-scale propaganda campaign and squads that attacked NF meetings and paper sales. The success of the ANL's campaigns contributed to the end of the NF's period of growth. During this period, there were also a number of black-led anti-fascist organizations, including the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) and local groups like the Newham Monitoring Project.\\"NMP‚Äôs History of Resisting Racism and Injustice\\"; Alastair BonnettRadicalism, Anti- Racism and Representation, London: Routledge, 2013, p. 57; Nigel Copsey Anti- Fascism in Britain, Springer, 1999, pp. 125‚Äì183 The SWP disbanded the ANL in 1981, but many squad members refused to stop their activities. They were expelled from the SWP in 1981, many going on to found Red Action. The SWP used the term squadism to dismiss these militant anti-fascists as thugs. In 1985, some members of Red Action and the anarcho-syndicalist Direct Action Movement launched Anti-Fascist Action (AFA). Their founding document said \\"we are not fighting Fascism to maintain the status quo but to defend the interests of the working class\\".AFA (London) Constitution Part 1.4 Thousands of people took part in AFA mobilizations, such as Remembrance Day demonstrations in 1986 and 1987, the Unity Carnival, the Battle of Cable Street's 55th anniversary march in 1991, and the Battle of Waterloo against Blood and Honour in 1992. After 1995, some AFA mobilizations still occurred, such as against the NF in Dover in 1997 and 1998. However, AFA wound down its national organization and some of its branches and had ceased to exist nationally by 2001.Nigel Copsey (2016). Anti-Fascism in Britain London: Routledge, There was a surge in fascist activity across Europe from 1989 to 1991 after the collapse of Communism. In 1991, the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe (CAFE) coordinated a large militant protest against the visit to London by French right-wing leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen. This sparked a surge in anti-fascist organizations throughout Europe. In the UK alone, in 1992 a number of left-wing groups formed anti-fascist front organizations, such as a re-launched ANL in 1992, the Socialist Party's Youth against Racism in Europe YRE, and the Revolutionary Communist Party's Workers Against Racism. A number of black-led organizations, along with the Labour Party Black Sections and the National Black Caucus, formed the Anti-Racist Alliance in 1991, which eventually became the National Assembly Against Racism.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley (2005). Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 107. ; Stefano Fella, Carlo Ruzza (2012). Anti-Racist Movements in the EU: Between Europeanisation and National Trajectories. Palgrave Macmillan. , pp. 67‚Äì68 In August 2018, the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for a revival of \\"an Anti-Nazi League-type cultural and political campaign\\" following a number of far-right and racist incidents in the UK, including fascist attacks on a socialist bookshop by members of the far-right and UKIP, marches in favor of far-right activist Tommy Robinson and high-profile Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. This \\"welcome and timely\\" call to action was supported in a Guardian letter signed by the league's founders, which included former Labour minister Peter Hain, political activist Paul Holborow and leading musicians from Rock Against Racism. = Asia =  Japan  In 2013, when Counter-Racist Action Collective (C.R.A.C.), which had been counter-acting against the conservative group Zaitokukai, began to denounce Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a \\"fascist,\\" groups calling themselves \\"Antifa\\" appeared around them. In addition to Tokyo, Antifa also have appeared in Hokkaido, Shizuoka, Aichi, and Hiroshima prefectures. They then promoted the Democratic Party's presidential election and participated in \\"Abe Out\\" demonstrations with liberals and opposition members of the Japanese Communist Party and the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. In 2020, the activities of Antifa increased. In February, those waving the flag of Antifa were identified among those who were counter-acting against Zaitokukai. In May, Antifa also participated in the protest against the Abe Cabinet's coronavirus measures. In the protest, a foreign man was holding the Antifa flag, which was written in German as \\"ANTIFASCHISTSCHE AKTION.\\" On May 17, Antifa was among the organizers of a nationwide protest against the revision of the Public prosecutor's office Law. When George Floyd protests occurred in the U.S. at the end of May, protest of \\"Black Lives Matter\\" were held in Tokyo and Osaka in June, and Antifa was also seen. On May 30 and June 6, Antifa and others led the protest against the hate crime by the police around the Shibuya Police Department. George Floyd protests were also held at the same time, and many foreigners and opposition members of the Diet also participated in the protests. Antifa's flag was raised, and there were arrests in the fight. The incident began when a Kurdish man in Japan claimed to have been unfairly questioned by Metropolitan Police officers and subjected to violence. Mainichi Shimbun and Kyodo News reported this as a hate crime though the Metropolitan Police denied. On June 10, the General Information Center for Foreign Residents of immigration bureaus across Japan received a \\"bomb threat\\" e-mail from a person claiming to be \\"Antifa\\" targeting the Immigration Bureau and the Shibuya Police Department for abusing foreigners. However, on June 13, the Japanese Kurdish Cultural Association, which consists of Kurds, expressed a negative view of the protest claims on their official Facebook page. The association declared that they did not support the protest and did not take any part in it, and abandoned the said person, saying there was no room to defend his actions in light of Japanese laws and customs. And the association announced that the demonstrators were not all involved in their usual protests against the crackdown on the Kurds or in their support activities. They said that a less-than-justified demonstration like this seems to have encouraged prejudice against Kurdish residents in Japan. They also said it's strange that no Japanese major media have covered them at all on this matter. = United States= After World War II, but prior to the development of the modern antifa movement, violent confrontations with Fascist elements happened sporadically in the United States. In 1958 over 500 Lumbee men armed with rocks, sticks and firearms attacked and disrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally, wounding several Klansmen in an event known as the Battle of Hayes Pond. In 1979 the Maoist Communist Workers' Party confronted a local Ku Klux Klan chapter, first by disrupting a screening of The Birth of a Nation in China Grove, North Carolina and later organizing a rally and a march against the Klan on November 3 called the \\"Death to the Klan March\\" by the CWP. The Maoists distributed flyers that \\"called for radical, even violent opposition to the Klan\\", suggesting the Klan ‚Äúshould be physically beaten and chased out of town.\\" In response, as the marchers collected, a caravan of ten cars (and a van) filled with an estimated 40 KKK and American Nazi Party members confronted the protesters, culminating in a shootout known as the Greensboro Massacre. In the 2010s, self-described antifa groups have become increasingly active in Western Europe and North America. These loose collectives first arose in the early 2010s in response to growing nationalism in countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and France. In the US, anti-fascist groups had existed since at least 1988 in the form of the Anti-Racist Action, but an American movement using the same name has become increasingly active since 2016, often affiliated with anarchism, and have become known for their clashes with far-right and alt-right groups. US anti- fascist activities have included violent disruptions and demonstrations which have drawn criticism from both sides of the mainstream political spectrum. Through their anarchist and anti-nationalist orientation, antifa groups have sometimes been linked to the punk subculture (including straight edge) both in the US and in Europe. =Syrian Civil War= British fighters of the International Freedom Battalion's 0161 Antifa Manchester Crew in Rojava Hundreds of foreign Antifa leftists have joined the International Freedom Battalion (founded in 2015) of the People's Protection Units (YPG) in the region called Rojava by kurd militias, in the North and East of Syria, out of a mixture of opposition to the Islamic State during the Syrian Civil War and willingness to defend what they call ¬´Rojava Revolution¬ª against the Syrian Arab Republic.
