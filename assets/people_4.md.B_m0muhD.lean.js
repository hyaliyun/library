Educating about genocide in Rwanda  Recent Rwanda history curricula explicitly stipulate the teaching of the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi, notably through the comparison \\"of different genocides\\" with a view to \\"suggest ways of preventing genocide from happening again in Rwanda and elsewhere\\". A comparative approach has been adopted, which is clearly reflected in the 2015 Curriculum for Sustainable Development. The competence-based curriculum framework mentions \\"genocide studies\\" as a cross- cutting issue, therefore introducing the study of genocide in a variety of subject areas. It further states that \\"Rwandan children should know about the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi alongside the Holocaust and other genocides\\".Rwanda Education Board. 2015. Competence based curriculum: Curriculum framework pre-primary to upper secondary. Ministry of Education, Republic of Rwanda. http://www.tcop.rw/ le/2041/download?token=T398Bm6a Teaching about the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, and thereby introducing genocide studies in history textbooks and curricula, has been part of a gradual process to promote national unity and peace. This process included a moratorium on some chapters of Rwandan history in 1995, which ended when considerations pertaining to the 1994 genocide were introduced into the 2008 history curriculum. Recent approaches also built on the acknowledgement of the disastrous effects of pre-genocide Rwandan education, which contributed to discrimination against the Tutsi population and constituted a backdrop for the ideology that led to the genocide. In contrast, introducing the history of the genocide in the education system was a recognition that schools, in addition to non-formal and informal learning environments, are crucial venues to impart knowledge about the genocide and to overcome silence, denial and conflict. These changes also correspond to a deeper reflection on appropriate pedagogies to help learners grapple with the legacy of the genocide. According to Jean-Damasc√®ne Gasanabo, director-general of the Research and Documentation Center on Genocide at the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide (CNLG) in Kigali, \\"This change in the curriculum has been supplemented by a shift to transform learning from one based on standard rote memorization to one that encourages discussion and a spirit of critical thinking and analysis. This approach identi es the student as an active participant in the learning experience, not merely a silent recipient of history as 'evangelical speech'.\\" Aegis Trust's Sustainable Peace Model/Framework The Kigali Genocide Memorial and Aegis Trust, in partnership with other Rwandan organizations such as the Educators' Institute for Human Rights, has developed education programmes and in-service training to help teachers build capacity and acquire historical knowledge to deal with genocides and mass atrocities. Such programmes emphasize \\"critical thinking, empathy and individual moral responsibility.\\"Gasanabo, J.D., Mutanguha, F. and Mpayimana, A.. 2016. Teaching about the Holocaust and Genocide in Rwanda. Contemporary Review of the Middle East. Special Issue: Holocaust Education, Volume 3, Issue 3, pp. 329-345. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347798916654583 They explore historical examples, primarily the genocide of the Jewish people and the genocide of the Tutsi, through a \\"Sustainable Peace Model/Framework\\" which seeks to link genocide education (looking back) to genocide prevention (looking into the present) to peace-building (looking forward).  Education about the Holocaust  \\"Genocide education\\" deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. Genocide studies ‚Äì referring to academic research about the broader trends and patterns of genocide and mass atrocities ‚Äì and genocide education have become more widespread in universities and schools, as genocide and mass atrocities are recurring phenomena in the world. The studies have expanded to examine theories about how and why genocide happens. Education about the particular event of the Holocaust includes considerations about the concept, planning and implementation of that genocide, and can prompt reflections as to how what we learn about the Holocaust can contribute to the prevention of mass atrocities today.  The role of gender  Scholars and educators are increasingly recognizing and exploring gender as a dimension of genocide and other mass atrocities. Educators may wish to consider how gender influences, affects, and manifests itself in genocide, from the strategies of its perpetrators to the experiences of its victims. Historically, most atrocities have been committed by men. Genocide scholar Adam Jones, however, notes that \\"when women, along with men, are mobilized, forced, encouraged, allowed to participate in genocide and other atrocious violence, they generally display no more reluctance than (often reluctant) males\\". Wendy Lower, for example, studied the role of German women during the Third Reich and found that relative to their role in German society and their professional positions, women participated in the perpetration of crimes \\"as zealous administrators, robbers, tormentors, and murderers\\".Jones, A. 2017. Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction, 3rd edition, Routledge.Lower, W. 2013. Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, Houghton Mi in Harcourt. Gender can shape and dictate both the experiences of victims and the methods perpetrators employ when committing genocide and mass atrocities. Roles often relegated to the female sphere can influence the fates of women. As traditional caregivers, for example, women who provide direct care for children or elderly relatives may inadvertently hinder or eliminate their own ability to survive genocidal violence. At the same time, perpetrators often differently persecute men and women. During the Holocaust, pregnant women and mothers of small children were consistently labeled \\"incapable of work\\". Consequently, women often found themselves among the first sent to the gas chambers.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \\"Women during the Holocaust,\\" https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005176 Aggressors' intent on a symbolic and physical disruption of group reproduction often target women and girls for sexualized violence, such as mass rape or forced sterilization. Cases also exist in which boys and men have been systematically sexually victimized. Transgressions of gender norms such as homosexuality and transsexuality have also served as grounds for the targeting of both men and women.

She is also fitted with satellite communications and electronic navigation systems. Service history Originally built by Ottavio Tofful and Yohan Vels on the Divar Island in Goa. After launching in Goa, Commander Donde sailed Mhadei to Colombo and Mauritius. Donde then took the boat on a circumnavigation voyage on 19 August 2009, and returned on 19 May 2010; Mhadei was the first Tonga 56 to complete a solo circumnavigation. In 2012, Mhadei was used by Indian Navy Lt Cdr Abhilash Tomy to complete a single-handed, unassisted, non-stop circumnavigation under sail. He was the first Indian, second Asian, and 79th person to do so. Mhadei finished the journey at Kochi, after completing a voyage of 23,100 nautical miles (42,781 km). In 2013, the navy's first all female team of sailors began preparation for another circumnavigation of the world, led by Lieutenant Commander Shweta Kapur. The crew practised in a race from Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro. In May 2016 INSV Mhadei set sail from Goa for a voyage to Port Louis in Mauritius skippered by Lt. Cdr. Vartika Joshi, a Naval Constructor. This was the first open-ocean voyage of the Navy‚Äôs all-woman crew of the Mhadei. It was a training voyage to expose the young crew to the weather that they would confront during the circumnavigation of the globe scheduled for 2017. The crew entered Port Louis, Mauritius, on Tuesday, 14 June 2016. The crew members were skipper Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, a Naval architect, and five others: Lieutenant P. Swathi, Lt. Pratibha Jamwal, Lt. Vijaya Devi, Sub Lt. Payal Gupta and Lt. B. Aishwarya.  Second Boat  A second boat in this class, INSV Tarini, was ordered in 2016 and commissioned into active service on 18 February 2017. She was built by Aquarius Shipyard Private Limited. The sail boat was inducted by Admiral Sunil Lanba at the INS Mandovi Boat Pool with an all women crew and is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi. The vessel will be Indian Navy's first all-woman global circumnavigation vessel and the extremely challenging expedition by Tarini's all-woman crew is slated to commence in August 2017.

The original location at 3927 Wilshire Boulevard was opened in 1932 by Italian-American restaurateur Alexander Perino, immediately becoming popular with Hollywood's elite. In 1950 it moved to a larger location at 4101 Wilshire, where it remained until it closed in 1986. The restaurant was a Los Angeles landmark which, like the Brown Derby, Chasen's, and Romanoff's, was famed for its celebrity clientele during the Hollywood Golden Age. Despite its closure, the restaurant enjoyed an afterlife as a filming location for film and television until the building was sold and demolished in 2005. History Alessandro Bruno Perino was born in Brusnengo, Piedmont, northern Italy in 1895; as a nineteen-year old pastry cook, he emigrated to the United States as a steerage passenger on the S/S La Lorraine, which arrived at the Port of New York in February 1914. With $2,000 in savings, Perino opened his famous Los Angeles restaurant in 1932\\"The Man Who Set the Standards\\", The Los Angeles Times, Sunday, January 10, 1982. The cuisine was a mixture of high-class Italian and French food at the then exorbitant price of $1.25 per dish. The restaurant quickly accrued a loyal clientele including Mae West, Dolores del R√≠o, Ronald Colman and Ezio Pinza\\"The Man Who Set the Standards\\", The Los Angeles Times, Sunday,January 10, 1982.. Despite a fire which gutted the interior in 1934, Perino's popularity grew throughout the 1930s, becoming a premiere gathering spot for celebrities, Hollywood executives and politicians. Bette Davis had a booth permanently reserved for her, Frank Sinatra would occasionally perform at the Steinway piano in the restaurant bar, and Cole Porter composed songs on the back of menus. Richard Nixon, Ronald and Nancy Reagan were regulars. During the 1940s and 50s the restaurant gained a reputation as a Mob hangout, because it was frequented by such figures as Bugsy Siegel and Johnny Stompanato. In the early 50s a mob summit convened between L.A. based mobster Jack Dragna and Anthony 'Big Tuna' Accardo was broken up by the police at Perino's. Other regular patrons were Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe, Alfred Hitchcock, Dean Martin, Joe DiMaggio and Elizabeth Taylor. Perino's was renowned for the high quality of its food, and Perino for his fastidious attention to detail. There were 150 separate entr√©es on the menu and 270 different wines. Food was never frozen, salad greens were brought in fresh from a farmer on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, tomatoes were never stored over ice for fear of diminishing their flavor, and ice for the bar never supplied from the kitchen for fear of contaminating it with the smell of food. Menu items changed daily and on special occasions pressed duck was served at the table prepared from an antique duck press that belonged to Joan Crawford and her fourth husband Alfred Steele. The service was also excellent, with waiters abiding by Perino's credo that \\"the best service is that which is never seen.\\" In 1950, Perino's moved to a larger location in a former Thriftimart supermarket at 4101 Wilshire. Architect Paul Revere Williams was hired to implement a $400,000 renovation. He chose a New Orleans theme, in pink, beige and peach tones, which would become Perino's signature. The outside featured a porte-coch√®re in wrought-iron, a mansard roof, and pink stucco. The central dining room, which could accommodate 150 diners, was a large rotunda lined with banquettes upholstered in salmon-colored velvet, crystal chandelier sconces, and floor-length mirrors. Tables were covered in pink linen, each with a single pink rose placed on top, and pastry-carts and serving trays were made of solid silver. In 1954 the restaurant suffered another disastrous fire, blamed on a discarded cigarette left on an upholstered chair, which cost $250,000 in damages. Paul Williams returned to supervise the restoration, which featured furniture and paneling in the \\"French Continental\\" style. Perino's would remain a hugely popular venue through the 1960s, and Alexander Perino would sell in 1969. The restaurants' popularity began to decline in the 1970s with changing tastes; an attempt to re-launch it under new ownership failed in 1986, leading to its closure. In 2002, the defunct restaurant was purchased by real estate developer Tom Carey, and the contents were auctioned off two years later. The building was demolished in 2005 and an apartment building constructed in its place. The lobby of the new building retains mementos from Perino's. In popular culture Before its closure in 1986, Perino's had already become a popular filming location, appearing both as itself and for general use in restaurant scenes. It continued in this vein and as a venue for the occasional private event through 2004, when it was purchased by a developer. The exterior of Perino's at its first location appears in Sunset Boulevard (1950), in the scene where Norma Desmond takes Joe to a haberdashery to buy clothes. George Hamilton appears in the restaurant, in the 1979 \\"Love at first Bite\\" film, with Susan Saint James and Richard Benjamin. Dustin Hoffman appears in the restaurant, in \\"Marathon Man\\". American Gigolo (1980) filmed a scene at Perino's where Richard Gere's character Julian asks Anne (Nina van Pallandt) for help. The 1981 biopic Mommie Dearest featured a scene where Joan Crawford attends dinner with Louis B. Mayer at Perino's. She later declares that \\"Perino's is my place!\\" in anger at having to dine with her boss. Later in the film Crawford and her daughter attend lunch there. Scarface (1983) uses Perino's for a restaurant scene between Tony Montana, Elvira and Manny. Numerous television shows used Perino's for restaurant scenes, including Melrose Place, Hart to Hart, Dallas, Falcon Crest and Columbo. 1992's Chaplin includes a scene where Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) takes Paulette Goddard (Diane Lane) to Perino's for dinner. The 2017 FX anthology series Feud: Bette & Joan sets numerous dining scenes at Perino's for the fictional counterparts of real-life regulars Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Hedda Hopper. The famous dining room of Perino's was recreated on a soundstage.

Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust addresses didactics and learning, under the larger umbrella of education about the Holocaust, which also comprises curricula and textbooks studies. The expression ‚ÄúTeaching and Learning about the Holocaust‚Äù is used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. While most Holocaust education centers have focused on the genocide committed against Jews by the Nazis, a growing number have expanded their mission and programming to include the murder of other groups by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes, the Armenian genocide, the Rwandan genocide, Kurdish genocide, Croatia‚ÄìSerbia genocide case, Bosnian genocide, indigenous genocide due to colonization, and other mass exterminations. These centers also address racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.  Contexts for teaching about the Holocaust  Multiple opportunities exist for teaching about the Holocaust. The text that follows explores the role that teaching and learning about the Holocaust can play in three specific contexts: the prevention of genocide, the promotion of human rights and dealing with traumatic pasts. = The prevention of genocide = To teach about the particularity of the Holocaust is an opportunity to teach about the nature and dynamics of mass atrocity crimes, i.e. genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The United Nations Framework of Analysis of Atrocity Crimes states ‚Äúatrocity crimes are considered to be the most serious crimes against humankind. Their status as international crimes is based on the belief that the acts associated with them affect the core dignity of human beings.‚Äù From a human perspective, but also from social, political and economic perspectives, the costs and consequences of these crimes are immeasurable and extend far beyond the limits of territories where they were perpetrated. Prevention has, therefore, been identified by the international community as a necessity for international peace and stability. Prevention requires continuous efforts and awareness in both the short and long term at the local, national and global levels. Such measures may include institutional initiatives that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights, ensure a better management of diverse societies and reinforce civil society and independent media. Education about the Holocaust, as well as education more broadly about genocide and mass atrocities, provides the opportunity to help build critical thinking skills, to augment resilient and effective responses to extreme and exclusionary ideologies, and to illuminate for students how they see themselves in the context of their country's past, present and future. = The promotion of human rights = The Holocaust began with abuses of power and gross human rights violations by Nazi Germany that over time escalated into war and genocide. While not all human rights violations result in genocide, the Holocaust presents an important case to be explored in a human rights context. The discriminatory policies and practices that dehumanized and marginalized Jews and other minority or political groups (such as depriving individuals of their citizenship) illuminate how human rights violations when combined with factors such as the abuse of power and/or exclusionary ideology can become normalized in a society ‚Äì even one framed by the rule of law. That these policies escalated over time to a state-sponsored system for murder underlines the dangerous environment that can result when human rights are disavowed. In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Holocaust, a number of international norms promoting human rights were formulated, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. Examining this outcome represents a crucial phase in understanding the evolution of human rights concepts. Still, education about the Holocaust and human rights education are two distinct fields. How educators can create the space for students to examine the history in a manner that respects the tenets of each field requires some thought. A number of organizations have considered these points of intersection, including the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), in partnership with Yad Vashem,European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. 2011. Toolkit on the Holocaust and Human Rights education in the EU. and the German Foundation ‚ÄúRemembrance, Responsibility and Future‚Äù (EVZ). Thoughtfully integrating examination of the Holocaust into a human rights framework can be an important dimension of education that promotes critical thinking about the roles and responsibilities of members of society and their leaders in the context of human rights.Eckmann, M. 2015. Is Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust Relevant for Human Rights Education? Gross, Z. and Stevic, E.D. (eds.), As the Witnesses Fall Silent: 21st Century Holocaust Education in Curriculum, Policy and Practice, UNESCO IBE/Springer International, pp. 65-53. = Dealing with the past = Educating about the Holocaust is primarily a duty for European countries, in which considerable segments of societies either collaborated with Nazi Germany or stood by. After an initial period of silence and/or minimization, many countries have developed an understanding of the need to educate about the Holocaust and the obligation to investigate and face their national past. Nevertheless, national, professional or individual responsibilities remain heavily debated within and among countries where the Holocaust took place. Even more than 70 years after the events, a self-critical vision of history that accounts for the range of responsibilities in the murder of Jews and other groups such as the Roma and Poles has yet to emerge in many places. Nationalistic ideologies continue to influence the ways in which history is remembered and taught. In 2017 a K√∂rber Foundation survey found that 40 percent of 14-year-olds in Germany did not know what Auschwitz was. The journalist Alan Posener attributed Germany's \\"growing historical amnesia\\" in part to a failure by the German film and television industry to reflect the country's history accurately. The following year a survey organized by the Claims Conference, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and others found that 41 percent of 1,350 American adults surveyed, and 66 percent of millennials, did not know what Auschwitz was, while 22 percent said they had never heard of the Holocaust. Many post-atrocity communities throughout the world struggle with divided societies. Social cohesion remains fractured and progress is blocked by the country's refusal to deal with its national history of genocide and mass atrocities and the long-term trauma such crimes cause. This challenge increases when conflicting parties or survivors and their tormentors must co- exist in the same society in the aftermaths of atrocity crimes. While some societies opt for an approach of silence, others have found that as a society transitions towards non-violent and humane ways to handle conflict, facing the past can become an important element of the national narrative. Teaching about a contested history involving atrocities that still affect the present is a particularly challenging task, all the more so because history education is one of the most difficult segments of education systems to reform. Moreover, dealing with the history of past abuses through education often requires a minimal consensus within the society, and therefore institutional support, before new historical narratives accounting for crimes perpetrated can be integrated in curricula and textbooks or tackled by teachers in formal education settings. Such a process is happening in Lithuania, where the Holocaust and the history of the Jews in Lithuania has not been taught adequately until fairly recently.Gerdziunas, Benas. \\"Decades after Soviet terror, Lithuania confronts its Holocaust.\\" Politico. 30 August 2017. 6 October 2017.  Educating about antisemitism  Educating about antisemitism focus on ensuring that learners are equipped with knowledge, skills and competencies that empower them to contribute to a culture of human rights and resist the stereotypes and misconceptions that lead to discrimination and violence against Jews. While most Holocaust education focus on the genocide committed against Jews by the Nazis, educating about antisemitism builds students‚Äô resilience to anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice.  Educating about genocide  ‚ÄúGenocide education‚Äù deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. To date, the Holocaust has been the most researched, documented and widely taught case of genocide. The Institute on the Holocaust & Genocide in Jerusalem established in 1979, believes that it may be the first holocaust education center to address the genocide of all peoples A growing number of holocaust education centers include genocide, intolerance, hatred, and human rights within their mission, programming, and curriculum.  The Holocaust in curricula and textbooks  The Holocaust in curricula and textbooks discusses the ways in which the Holocaust is presented in secondary school level history and social studies curricula worldwide, and conceptualized and narrated in textbooks. The status of the Holocaust in curricula and textbooks varies considerably worldwide. Curricula and textbooks, in particular those designed for history teaching, provide both a space for the formation of a condensed canon of knowledge which is considered to be relevant to a specific society, and a means by which claims to social legitimacy may be made. The study of curricula and textbooks enables the reconstruction of patterns of perception and interpretation, or the standards and values which hold sway at any given time. Moreover, they offer insights into the variety of ways in which national identities are conceived of and constructed. They are ideal sources for the following reasons: # Curricula and textbooks strive towards the construction of a socially cohesive understanding of history. They not only determine which historical events are considered relevant and thus worth incorporating into a shared inventory of historical understanding, but also prescribe the interpretative framework in which such events may be classified. # Textbooks share a relatively homogeneous function across a wide geographical space. They thus meet a prerequisite for the analysis of ways in which concepts of identity change from place to place and of processes of convergence and divergence to which concepts of the Holocaust are subjected. # Curricula and textbooks continue to provide reasonably reliable points of reference for educators. The complexity of the Holocaust and the sensitivity towards the social and political consequences of this event which continues to be felt in the present day mean that teachers are often uncertain about how they should teach the Holocaust. As a result, curricula and in particular textbooks are held by educators to provide secure sources of information and of methods to which teachers refer on the assumption that they provide accurate content and reliable didactic and methodological guidelines, which have been compiled by experienced historians, educational experts and authors. # Although television, the internet and family stories generally represent the primary sources of knowledge about the Holocaust, curricula and textbooks tell the contemporary formation of historical knowledge because they fix in words the conceptual and narrative categories in which events of the past are to be learnt in a given society. One of the central concerns when comparing both curricula and textbooks, is therefore to ensure that linguistic variations be given due attention. The absence of the words ‚ÄòHolocaust‚Äô or ‚ÄòShoah‚Äô (or their equivalents in each language), for example, does not mean that this event is not taught, because alternative words or paraphrases may also convey knowledge of the event in unexpected ways.  Contribution to Global Citizenship Education  Global citizenship education aims to develop students to be informed and critically literate, socially connected, respectful of diversity, and ethically responsible and engaged. There exist strong opportunities for aligning education about the Holocaust with the goals of global citizenship education. Understanding how and why the Holocaust happened can help learners reflect on their role as global citizens, develop skills in historical understanding regarding why individuals and states acted the way they did in their given circumstances, and possibly take action on civic issues important for their school and society. Teaching about the Holocaust can, therefore, be expected to provide opportunities for contemporary skill-building, decision- making, and critical self-reflection on one's own role in society. The study of the Holocaust is highly compatible with global citizenship education for at least three key reasons: * The Holocaust addresses themes that are central concerns of global citizenship education, including human rights and discrimination. * The Holocaust forms the historical backdrop that informed the development of the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which can be understood concretely by linking them to specific violations before and during the Second World War. * A review of research about teaching and learning about the Holocaust demonstrates that some approaches can have outcomes that are sought by global citizenship education framework. UNESCO has stated that Holocaust and genocide education is part of its efforts to promote Global Citizenship Education and a priority within its Education 2030 agenda.

Catholicism was on the rise among the traditionally Orthodox population due to the political late 14th century context, as the Ottoman advance, nearly encircling the imperial capital Constantinople (conquering (H)Adrianopolis, now Edirne, in 1360), the Byzantine emperors sought a political and hopefully military ally in the Catholic west, which had crusaded against Islam to and in the Middle East before. Similarly in Moldavia, where Bogdan I obtained virtual independence in 1359 as founding voivode (autonomous prince), seeking aid and protection from Poland, welcomed Latin missionaries, Franciscan Friars Minor (founding a monastery at Siret in 1340) and Dominicans.  History  Bogdan's son and indirect successor La»õcu of Moldavia (1365-1373) invited a delegation from Rome, promising his and the people's conversion to Catholicism and asked Pope Urban V to send missionaries and erect a Latin diocese in his principality's capital, Siret. On 24 July 1370 the Pope instructed the archbishop of Prague and bishops of Bratislava and Krak√≥w (Cracovia) to verify/complete the sincerity of La≈£cu (although his wife remained Orthodox) and mandated them to erect such diocese covering the Moldavian state. Pope Gregory XI established it in 1371, exempt (i.e. directly subject to theHoly See); Polish Franciscan Andrzej Jastrzebiec was consecrated first Bishop by archbishop Florian Mokrski of Cracow. The cathedral, dedicated to John the Baptist, was built by queen Margareth, Catholic kin of the Hungarian royal family, which in 1377 had invited Dominicans to Siret. However prince La≈£cu favoring of Catholicism met grave opposition from the Orthodox clergy, while effective Latin converts were concentrated in the north of Moldavia, near Catholic neighbour kingdoms Poland and Hungary. Since 1372, when Andrzej was nominated Apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Halyƒç, probably never returning to Siret, he and his (all Polish) successors resided more in Poland then in Moldavia. In 1388 prince Petru (Peter) II \\"Mu≈üat\\" (1375‚Äì1391) transferred the Moldavian voivode's capital from Siret to Suceava, thus contributing to the crisis in the diocese of Siret, now abandoned by both crown and episcopate. ;Exempt Bishops of Siret (all Roman Rite) * Andrzej Jastrzƒôbiec (Polish), Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1371.05.09 ‚Äì 1388.03.12), next Bishop of Vilnius (Lithuania) (1388.03.12 ‚Äì death 1398.11.14) * Jan I Sartorius (1388 ‚Äì death 1394) * Stefan Martini, Dominican Order (O.P.) (1394.06.08 ‚Äì death 1412.01.10), reminded by the Pope he could not celebrate pontifical masses outside his diocese, but in 1396 nominated Auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Cracovia, maintaining his title as Ordinary of Siret. At the 1412 erection of the Latin Metropolitan Archbishopric of Lviv (Lemberg in German, the language of many Catholics; now in Ukraine), Siret became its suffragan (no longer exempt). ;Suffragan Bishops of Siret * In 1413, due to the Western Schism ('Babylonian exile' of Antipopes in Avignon, 1378 to 1417), two rival bishops were appointed: ** Miko≈Çaj (Nicholas) Venatoris, Augustinians (O.E.S.A.) (1413.03.05 ‚Äì ?1434) ** [uncanonical?] Tomasz Grueber (1413.07.31 ‚Äì ?) * Jan II (1420.09.04 ‚Äì 1422?) - according to a Vatican archive document found by Eubel, who doubts its authenticity * Jan III, O.F.M. (1434.01.29 ‚Äì ?). The diocese of Siret was effectively suppressed, but from circa 1418, the Holy See erected another Moldavian bishopric, the Diocese of Baia, which inherited its territory (1434?).

Location  It starts at Leopoldstra√üe, then crosses the Kurf√ºrstenplatz and Hohenzollernplatz and changes after the Winzererstra√üe in the west to the Schwerere-Reiter-Stra√üe as its extension. Between Kurf√ºrstenplatz and Leopoldstra√üe are smaller shops. Together with Leopoldstra√üe the shopping street forms the so-called Schwabinger T. According to a study by the traffic data and SaaS provider INRIX of 2016, Hohenzollernstra√üe is the most heavily occupied road in Germany.  History  Until the incorporation of Schwabing to Munich in 1890, the Burgfrieden around Munich ran at the height of Hohenzollernstra√üe. In 1892 the street was renamed \\"H√∂rmannstra√üe\\" after the Hohenzollern nobility. In 1901, Wassily Kandinsky founded his art school \\"Phalanx\\" on Hohenzollernstra√üe 6a, where Gabriele M√ºnter became a pupil. In the house number 104, Willibald Besta had his studio there until 1929. Hohenzollernstra√üe 21 was the location of the 1902 founded \\"Lehr- und Versuchsatelier f√ºr angewandte und freikunst\\", of Wilhelm von Debschitz and Hermann Obrist, which developed into Germany's largest private educational institution. Paul Klee taught there in 1908. In 1910 Emil Preetorius was the director of the school. In house number 1 lived the writer and painter Fanny zu Reventlow, who was known as \\"Schwabinger Skandalgr√§fin\\". Joachim Ringelnatz lived in the Gartenhaus of Hohenzollernstra√üe 31a /I from 1920 to 1930. In Hohenzollernstra√üe 110, Werner Heisenberg spent some fourteen years of his youth. In 1910, Georg Kerschensteiner founded an experimental school in Hohenzollernstra√üe 14 which was built in 1905/1906. In 1938, the building was transformed into a hospital, which from 1945 to 1960 served as the \\"Chirurgisches Krankenhaus M√ºnchen-Nord\\". In 1961, a high school took its place, where for example, Michael Lerchenberg went to school. Since 1941, between Zentnerstra√üe and Schleissheimer Stra√üe, on Hohenzollernstra√üe is the neo-classical styled Nordbad, which includes a grandstand for 1,400 spectators. From 1959 to 2009, Theater44 was located at Hohenzollernstra√üe 44. From the Kurf√ºrstenplatz to the west, the tram lines 12 and 27 run over Hohenzollernstra√üe. Until August 1900, a horse-drawn carriage had already been running along the line from Promenadeplatz to Hohenzollernstra√üe.

He was also known for his theory of epic heroic poetry, and related publications. He retired in 1977, and in 1991 the British Academy elected him as a Senior Fellow. Early life and education Hatto was born in London on 11 February 1910. His father was Thomas Hatto, a solicitor's clerk who later became the Assistant Chief Solicitor in the British Transport Commission legal service, and his mother Alice Hatto (n√©e Waters), a nurse. The family lived in Forest Hill, and later Clapham. As an eight-year-old boy at the end of the First World War, Hatto spent a formative summer \\"running wild\\", as he put it, with an aunt in the \\"still semi-pagan\\" village of Barcombe; Hatto's interest in the community and its surroundings, a rural landscape far removed from his London roots as the son of a solicitor's clerk, foreshadowed his interest in the intricacies of human society. In 1923 Hatto was awarded a scholarship to Dulwich College. He entered on the \\"modern\\" side and studied German, Latin, and French, among other subjects, with middling results. He met more success at King's College London, where his father, refusing to see his son \\"loll on a Sixth Form bench\\", sent him in 1927. Hatto studied there with Robert Priebsch, Frederick Norman, and Henry Gibson Atkins. Norman, who had such an influence on Hatto that he forever after referred to Norman as \\"my tutor\\", recognised Hatto's potential in academia. He refused to take back Hatto's books at the end of term, stating \\"No, not yours, Mr Hatto, you will be needing them in years to come!\\" In an effort to improve his German Hatto left in 1932 for the University of Bern, where, through John Rupert Firth's earlier instruction, he became a Lektor for English. Hatto also studied under Helmut de Boor and Fritz Strich. In 1934 King's College awarded Hatto a London MA with distinction for his thesis, \\"A Middle German Apocalypse Edited from the Manuscript British Museum, Add. 15243\\". Hatto argued that the manuscript had been written in southwestern Thuringia between 1350 and 1370, and that it was related to the early-15th-century MS Meiningen 57. That same year he returned to King's College, having picked up the local dialect B√§rnd√ºtsch, and bringing back with him Rose Margot Feibelmann, a medical student from D√ºsseldorf whom he married in 1935. As she was Jewish, the move probab;y saved her life and the lives of her parents, who followed in March 1939. Hatto returned to London, settling first in Radlett and later in Mill Hill, and took up an assistant lectureship in German at King‚Äôs College. After four years the position was no longer needed and Norman, a mentor to Hatto, recommended him for a new lectureship at Queen Mary College, London. Hatto was chosen over many other applicants, in part, he thought, because the Principal, Sir Frederick Barton Maurice, admired his skill at rugby. In 1938 Hatto became the Head of the Department of German, a position he held until his retirement in 1977. The Second World War Hatto's appointment at Queen Mary College had barely begun when, in February 1939, he was recruited, on the recommendations of Maurice and Norman, to work in the cryptographic bureau in Room 40 at the Foreign Office. Norman was working there also, and on 3 September the two were sent to Bletchley Park, where they worked under John Tiltman. At least two other professors of German, Walter Bruford and Leonard Ashley Willoughby, had served in cryptography during the First World War, and many more served during the Second World War. As a \\"nursery for Germanists\\", Bletchley Park included in its ranks Bruford, Leonard Forster, Kenneth Brooke, Trevor Jones, C. T. Carr, D. M. Mennie, R. V. Tymms, Dorothy Reich, William Rose, K. C. King, F. P. Pickering, and H. B. Willson. Hatto was well-suited to the task of cryptography, given his philological background and his fluent German. At Bletchley Park he scrutinised ciphers to look for hints of future ciphers. One of his successes was discovering three-letter call signs in the preamble to messages that served as the key to communications between the land, sea and air arms of the Third Reich's combined armed forces, the Wehrmacht, thereby aiding the Allied forces before the Allied invasion of Sicily. After Germany fell part of Hatto's section was dispatched to Tokyo, by way of Ceylon. Hatto was invited along by Denys Page but declined, somewhat reluctantly, for his daughter, Jane, had just been born. Hatto kept silent about his wartime work, even after the work done at Bletchley Park was revealed in F. W. Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret, published in 1974. Though he was not named in the book, he was nevertheless alarmed by it. According to one of his colleagues, its publication led him to fear being kidnapped by the Soviets to the Lubyanka, \\"so far removed from the Reading Room of the British Museum\\". Postwar career Wartime duties kept Hatto busy until 1945, although from 1944 onwards he was allowed to lecture in Medieval German at University College London one day a week. He returned to Queen Mary College in 1945, to find the school struggling with its finances and enrolment. As the war became more distant, however, he developed a strong German Department. He started with just himself and a part-time colleague, but by the time he retired the Department had five full-time staff and one and a half language assistants. In 1946 the University of London made him a Reader in German and in 1953 he was promoted to Professor. Though much of his work was addressed to an academic readership, Hatto's best-known works are translations of three Medieval German poems: Tristan by Gottfried von Strassburg, Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the Nibelungenlied. These were three of what Hatto saw as the four great German narrative poems of the age (the fourth, Willehalm, was translated by one of his pupils). Following the translation of Tristan, published as a Penguin Classic in 1960, Hatto received an invitation from a professor of German at the University of Auckland to visit for several months in 1965. The ensuing trip around the world took Hatto to Istanbul, Delhi, Kathmandu, Bangkok, Auckland, Wellington, Fiji, Hawaii, California, the Grand Canyon, and New York, where he acquired a Kirghiz‚ÄêRussian dictionary. Hatto retired in 1977, by which time he had had at least 72 works published. Personal life Hatto and his wife Margot had a daughter, Jane, and a son-in-law, Peter. They remained married until her death in 2000. Hatto himself died of bronchopneumonia shortly before turning 100, on 6 January 2010, at Field House in Harpenden.

The squadron deployed to EOD alerts throughout the United Kingdom and had an additional role to undertake worldwide. 5131 was the only UK military EOD team that was qualified to deal with ejector seats, aircraft canopies and bomb disposal work undertaken in the airfield environment. The squadron latterly operated out of RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire as an element of No. 42 (Expeditionary Support) Wing (42 ESW). In November 2018, it was announced that the squadron would be disbanded by 2020 with the work being passed onto the British Army EOD units. History The history of the squadron dates back to the early days of the Second World War when four bombs were detonated by an RAF bomb disposal team in the Shetland Islands. At that time, there were over 29 bomb disposal squadrons in the RAF with upwards of 870 personnel spread across them. In the Second World War, the RAF looked after airfields and anything that involved ordnance dropped from aircraft (Axis or Allied), the Royal Navy looked after naval ordnance and the rest was taken care of by the Royal Engineers of the British Army. By the end of the war in Europe (VE Day), the RAF bomb disposal branch had dealt with over 176,000 weapons in Britain and Europe. To date, the squadron is the Ministry of Defence's lead unit for the safe disposal of air weapons. Besides dealing with unexploded ordnance dropped from the air, since the Second World War 5131 were deployed to most of the major theatres that the UK armed forces have been involved in (Falkland Islands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan). During the beach landings on the 27 May 1982 at San Carlos in the Falklands Conflict, one of the officers of 5131 (BD) Squadron, needed to assess some unexploded ordnance that was lodged in the walls of the field hospital, but had to wait until daylight to do so. To alleviate the worry for the patients who could not be moved to safer medical care, he opted to sleep that night alongside the unexploded ordnance. In the Afghanistan conflict, members of 5131 (BD) Squadron were part of the Joint Force Counter-IED Task Force alongside the British Army bomb disposal experts, although 5131 themselves are keen to point out that it is not their primary task. Counter-IED operations remained the mainstay of the Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal technicians. 5131 Squadron had a remit to keep two teams on standby readiness to deploy around the United Kingdom to defuse and safely dispose of any conventional air dropped weapons (CMD - Conventional Munitions Disposal). In addition to this, the squadron also had to support the Defence Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) teams for counter-CBRN operations worldwide. The squadron was also utilised when RAF land was being sold off or disposed of; in this instance they were making sure that the ground is safe and no historical weapons are present. As befits the squadron's heritage and loyalty, it was the only one of the EOD teams that operated in the defence community who were qualified to work on aircraft ejector seats and explosive canopy charges. In the squadron's 77-year history, they were based at RAF Detling, RAF Doncaster, RAF Rufforth, RAF Stafford, RAF North Luffenham and RAF North Coates. Since June 1995, and their disbandment in 2020, 5131 (BD) were based at RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire and had responsibility for the disposal of air delivered weapons in the United Kingdom. Between 1970 and 1987, 5131 used Orford Ness as a site to destroy large amounts of munitions. The squadron used a mock village set up in Rogue Sale Wood, which occupies the south-western edge of RAF Wittering where the squadron had its last base. Staff on the squadron were recruited from the Weapons Technician branch of Trade Group 1 in the Royal Air Force. The squadron was featured on the BBC One Show in August 2011 when presenter Lucy Siegle took part in a bomb disposal exercise. Personnel assigned to the squadron were allowed to wear the BD patch on the uniform; this differed from the official squadron badge and has a vertically assigned bomb in the middle, surrounded by two sets of laurel leaves and the initials 'BD' upon it. In November 2018, it was announced that the squadron would disband by 2020 with all EOD work being undertaken by the British Army as it has \\"more qualified personnel than the RAF, spread over a wider geographical area.\\" The Royal Navy will keep their specialist maritime EOD units and the Metropolitan Police in London will deal with any devices found in their area. Notable awards RAF bomb disposal technicians have won a total of 43 bravery awards including six George Crosses and eleven George Medals. * Squadron leader Wilson Charlton - awarded the George Cross after defusing more than 200 bombs in two months during the Battle of Britain. * Flight lieutenant Ted Costick - awarded the Queens Gallantry Medal for defusing a bomb in a hotel on the seafront at Famagusta, Cyprus, whilst under fire from the Turkish Army and the Cypriot National Guard in July 1974. * Chief technician Dave Lowe - awarded the Queens Gallantry Medal for defusing IED's in Afghanistan in 2011.

GRALE play a key role in meeting UNESCO's commitment to monitor and report on countries' implementation of the Bel√©m Framework for Action. This framework was adopted by 144 UNESCO Member States at the Sixth International Conference on Adult Learning and Education (CONFINTEA VI), which was held in Bel√©m, Brazil in 2009. In the Bel√©m Framework for Action, countries agreed to improve ALE across five areas of action: policy, governance, financing, participation, inclusion and equity, and quality.UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2010b. Bel√©m Framework for Action. Hamburg. http://unesdoc. unesco.org/images/0018/001877/187789m.pdf  Overview  Since it was founded in 1945, UNESCO has been supporting global dialogue and action in the field of Adult Learning and Education. In 1949, it organized the first CONFINTEA. Since then, five further CONFINTEA conferences have taken place at intervals of roughly twelve years, providing UNESCO member states with valuable opportunities to consider, compare and develop their approaches to ALE. The GRALE series lies at the heart of global monitoring of ALE. Each report gathers the latest data and evidence on ALE, highlights good policies and practices, and reminds governments of their ALE-related commitments. As part of the process of gathering data for GRALE, UNESCO invites countries to submit detailed national reports on ALE. Thus, GRALE encourages countries to undertake a self-assessment exercise and to consider their progress in each of the five action areas identified in the Bel√©m Framework for Action. Following the publication of each GRALE, its findings are presented at a wide range of events and discussed with a broad range of partners. GRALE therefore engages countries in dialogue and encourages them to learn from each other on how to improve ALE policies and practices.  Reports  GRALE 1UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2010a. Global Report on Adult Learning and Education. Hamburg. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ images/0018/001864/186431e.pdf was designed to inform discussions at CONFINTEA VI in 2009. In order to prepare GRALE 1, countries were invited to submit national reports, which were largely in narrative form. Based on these reports, GRALE I provided a general overview of trends and identified key challenges in ALE. The report found that while many countries had implemented adult education policies, governments were not allocating sufficient funds for the sector to deliver its full potential. GRALE 2UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning. 2013. Second Global Report on Adult Learning and Education: Rethinking Literacy. Hamburg. http://unesdoc.unesco. org/images/0022/002224/222407E.pdf presented the first opportunity to take stock of the implementation of the Bel√©m Framework for Action. Member states were invited to complete a monitoring survey that was more structured than the narrative reports that had been submitted for GRALE 1. GRALE 2 also focused on a specific theme: youth and adult literacy, which the Bel√©m Framework for Action identifies as the foundation of lifelong learning. GRALE 2 helped clarify concepts of literacy, providing guidance and inspiration for the later drafting of the Recommendation on Adult Learning and Education (2015). GRALE 3 reflects the move towards a more holistic view of education and lifelong learning embedded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This holistic view is the rationale behind the chapters on health and well-being, employment and the labour market, and social, civic and community life. GRALE 4 monitors the extent to which UNESCO Member States put their international commitments regarding ALE into practice and reflects data submitted by 159 countries. It calls for a major change in the approach to ALE, backed by adequate investment to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to access and benefit from ALE and that its contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is fully realized. GRALE 5 is currently in the making. It will combine survey data, policy analysis and case studies to provide policy-makers, researchers and practitioners an up-to-date picture of the status of ALE in UNESCO Member States, together with a review of citizenship education, including global citizenship education. It will provide recommendations for strengthening developments in ALE and for promoting active and global citizenship. GRALE 5 will be launched at the seventh International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VII) in Morocco in 2022.

He was an associate professor of English at the University of Toronto, and known for his contributions to the studies of Old English and Anglo-Saxon literature. His most notable work, The Dating of Beowulf, was credited with upsetting the accepted orthodoxy of the dating of the Anglo- Saxon poem Beowulf, and leaving behind what was described in A Beowulf Handbook as \\"a cautious and necessary incertitude\\". Chase died of cancer in 1984, shortly before his promotion to full professor.  Early life and education  Colin Robert Chase was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1935. His father was Robert Lamont Chase, and his mother Mary Coyle Chase, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. Colin Chase had two brothers, Michael Lamont Chase, and Barry Jerome Chase. Colin Chase obtained his B.A. from Harvard University in 1956, and studied classics and philosophy for five years at a Jesuit seminary. In 1962 and 1964 he received M.A.s from Saint Louis University and Johns Hopkins University, and at the University of Toronto, where in 1967 he became a part-time instructor, he completed his Ph.D. in 1971. His dissertation was entitled Panel Structure in Old English Poetry.  Career  Chase became an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in 1971, the same year he completed his Ph.D. Four years later he was promoted to associate professor. At the university he taught a wide variety of classes and had many doctoral students. He was a faculty member of St. Michael's College and the Centre for Medieval Studies; from 1977 until 1984, he chaired the centre's Medieval Latin Committee. Much of Chase's work was on Old English and Anglo- Latin literature, and he focused his research on the pre-conquest literature of England. He was particularly known for his 1981 edited collection The Dating of Beowulf, and from 1976 served as the chief reviewer of the Beowulf section of \\"The Year's Work in Old English Studies\\" in the Old English Newsletter. The Dating of Beowulf was credited with challenging the accepted orthodoxy over the date that the epic poem was created; in its wake came what was described in A Beowulf Handbook as \\"a cautious and necessary incertitude.\\" An anonymous reviewer of the book termed it \\"one of the most important inconclusions in the study of Old English\\", and declared that \\"henceforth every discussion of the poem and its period will begin with reference to this volume.\\" Chase's other major publication was a scholarly edition of Two Alcuin Letter-Books. He also wrote eight articles, and contributed to three videos made by the Toronto Media Centre, most popularly The Sutton Hoo ship-burial, about the Anglo-Saxon ship-burial unearthed at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. He additionally participated in the revision of Jack Ogilvy's Books Known to the English. Chase died in 1984, while his promotion to full professor was underway. At the time he was working on a study of the lives of the saints, and had started a new series of editions of the lives of the pre-conquest saints. The Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto, matched by the Ontario Student Opportunity Trust Fund, awards the Colin Chase Memorial Bursary each year in Chase's memory. The scholarship goes to \\"a graduate student in the Centre for Medieval Studies, on the basis of academic excellence and financial need.\\"  Personal life  Chase had a wife, Joyce, and five children: Deirdre, Robert, Tim, Mary, and Patrick. He was a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church, and participated in its training program. He also performed in campus stage productions, a talent that had nearly led to a career in acting. He died of cancer in 1984.

It was built for Irish politician Charles Brownlow, 1st Baron Lurgan in 1833 by Scottish architect William Henry Playfair and was used as a military headquarters in both world wars. History The house was constructed in 1833 by Scottish architect William Henry Playfair for Charles Brownlow, 1st Baron Lurgan and his family. The property remained in the family until the start of the 20th century, when it was purchased by Lurgan Real Property Company Ltd. It was later sold to Lurgan Loyal Orange District Lodge (the local contingent of the Orange Order), who continue to own the property today. Throughout the world wars of the 20th century, the building played an important role as a headquarters for various military purposes. During the First World War the house acted as the headquarters of the 16th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles and the 10th Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, while in World War II it was a base for American troops. In 1996 the building was badly damaged by an arson attack. Lurgan architectural firm DSC Partners designed the building's refurbishment, which also involved an expert from the restoration that followed the 1992 Windsor Castle fire. In 2014 a museum was opened in the basement of the building to commemorate its role during World War I. In August 2015 a World War II exhibition was added, highlighting the building's usage as a military outpost as well as the wider participation of Northern Ireland in providing temporary facilities for the British and American armies at the time.

The tunnel crosses the Palatine Watershed in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It was originally built for a single track, but a second track was built a few years later.  Location The tunnel is located in the northwest of the Palatine Forest (Pf√§lzerwald). It is located mainly on the urban area of Kaiserslautern; the smaller, eastern part is in Hochspeyer. The tunnel passes through the Heiligenberg mountain without a curve.  History The Bavarian King Ludwig I approved the construction of a main line railway running east- west from Rheinschanze to Bexbach on 21 December 1837. Between Hochspeyer and Kaiserslautern numerous hills and mountains had to be overcome. The construction of the route was a problem, because line had to pass over the watershed between the Lauter and the Hochspeyerbach between these two towns. This required the construction of a 1347-metre-long tunnel. As early as 1847, railway traffic commenced between Ludwigshafen and Neustadt. The line between Kaiserslautern and Homburg opened on 2 July 1848; this was followed by the opening of the Frankenstein‚ÄìHomburg section and then the Frankenstein‚ÄìKaiserslautern section, including the Heiligenberg Tunnel, which was opened on 2 December 1848. Since the main line from Mannheim to Saarbr√ºcken had always been of great importance for long-distance traffic, it was gradually electrified from 1960 onwards. This required the enlargement of the Heiligenberg tunnel. Work was carried out with trains running, with one side of the tunnel being widened at a time with the affected track blockaded. This delayed the introduction of the electrical operation, which eventually commenced on 12 March 1964. The loading gauge was enlarged to allow the introduction of TGV services between November 2001 and May 2002. This was achieved by the installation of ballastless track using the Getrac A3 system, which allowed a lowering of the superstructure by 20 cm because of its lower profile. It was designed by Kirchner on behalf of the DB AG Regionalb√ºro S√ºdwest, Stuttgart and cost ‚Ç¨3.1 million. A railway accident occurred in the Heiligenberg Tunnel on 28 June 1988. One passenger was killed on the D 2754 express (Heidelberg‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). 10 people had major and 28 had minor injuries. After a violent storm, part of the retaining wall east of the Heiligenberg Tunnel fell onto the tracks towards Mannheim. A freight train loaded with bulk goods from Saarbr√ºcken ran into the rubble and partly derailed; the locomotive and three wagons were forced onto the track. An express train running immediately after it then ran straight into the damaged vehicles.

Theme  The title of the book is a quotation from a poem, The Ship of Death, by D H Lawrence about mortality: ‚ÄúPiecemeal the body dies, and the timid soul/has her footing washed away, as the dark flood rises.‚Äù The main theme is growing old and dying. It is told from multiple viewpoints, all of people linked in some way to Francesca (Fran) Stubbs, an elderly woman who does occasional work for a charity on aspects of living accommodation for the old. There is no strong plot: rather the book conveys different experiences of, and attitudes to, the twilight years of life, with the past histories of the main characters' lives being gradually revealed. In the background are two major contemporary concerns - climate change and the refugee crisis of the years during which it was written, to which there are frequent references: the flood in the title is also a reference to the effects of climate change and to the seas on which many refugees sought to escape to Europe. There is also mention of other potential ecological catastrophes, over which Fran's daughter Poppet is very concerned.  Critical reception  Critical reaction to the book was generally favourable. Reviewers remarked on the relative absence of plot, the mordant wit with which the theme is lightened, and the way the narrative approach, with its multiple viewpoints, mirrors the wanderings of Fran's own mind. The reviewer for The Independent described the book as \\"witty and intelligent but ultimately uncomfortable, melancholic and rather doom-laden work. It‚Äôs not a particularly easy book to read, but it is brimming with relevance.\\" https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dark-flood- rises-margaret-drabble-review-a7419476.html The Guardian reviewer wrote, \\"beneath the apparently placid surface, Drabble‚Äôs novel seethes with apocalyptic intent.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/03/the-dark- flood-rises-by-margaret-drabble-review The New York Times reviewer summed up the book: \\"this humane and masterly novel by one of Britain‚Äôs most dazzling writers is something else as well, deeper than mere philosophy: a praisesong for the tragical human predicament exactly as it has been ordained on Earth, our terminal house.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/books/review/dark- flood-rises-margaret-drabble-.html?_r=0  References   Further reading  * The Guardian, 3 November 2016, retrieved 16 May 2017: The Dark Flood Rises by Margaret Drabble review ‚Äì coming to terms with death * The Independent, 15 November 2016, retrieved 16 May 2017: The Dark Flood Rises by Margaret Drabble, book review: A rather doom-laden work * New Statesman, 30 November 2016, retrieved 16 May 2017: Margaret Drabble's The Dark Flood Rises is a significant achievement * New York Times, 14 February 2017, retrieved 16 May 2017: Death and Disaster Stalk the Characters in Margaret Drabble‚Äôs New Novel Category:2016 British novels Category:Novels by Margaret Drabble ","title":"The Dark Flood Rises"},{"id":"54058198","text":"Dennis Beecraft (born 5 May 1968) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s, and 1990s.

A CASB can offer a variety of services such as monitoring user activity, warning administrators about potentially hazardous actions, enforcing security policy compliance, and automatically preventing malware.  Types  A CASB may deliver security, management or both. Broadly speaking, \\"security\\" is the prevention of high-risk events, whilst \\"management\\" is the monitoring and mitigation of high-risk events. CASBs that deliver security must be in the path of data access, between the user and the cloud. Architecturally, this might be achieved with proxy agents on each end-point device, or in agentless fashion without requiring any configuration on each device. Agentless CASBs allow for rapid deployment and deliver security on both company-managed and unmanaged BYOD devices. Agentless CASB also respect user privacy, inspecting only corporate data. Agent-based CASBs are difficult to deploy and effective only on devices that are managed by the corporation. Agent-based CASBs typically inspect both corporate and personal data. CASBs that deliver management may use APIs to inspect data and activity in the cloud to alert of risky events after the fact. Another management capability of a CASB is to inspect firewall or proxy logs for usage of cloud applications. API-only CASBs such as Cloudlock offer management using APIs provided by the major SaaS applications. In contrast, multi-mode CASBs offer both management and security.

In adapting Lastman to Delitoon, each panel was split up to follow the traditional webtoon type of manhwa, where instead of clicking to advance to the next page, the reader scrolls down to keep reading. None of Lastman's spin-off titles have yet to appear on Delitoon. Some visual differences appear between the physical and Delitoon releases of the series, notably the entirety of the eighth volume being entirely in colour on Delitoon, whereas in the physical release, only the first few pages are, with the remainder being in black and white. Lastman is depicted as a \\"French-style manga\\", by Bastien Viv√®s: \\"We use the format and some codes of the manga but we‚Äôre not playing at imitating Japanese culture\\". Viv√®s also mentions other influences such as Disney movies and blockbusters from the 80's and 90's (some of them by Steven Spielberg). Most of the characters in Lastman are named after busty pornographic actresses, notably Rachel Aldana, and Tomie Katana having both her name and likeness based on Hitomi Tanaka. To keep up with the exacting publication rhythm of 20 sheets per week, the authors have well-defined tasks: \\"Bastien [Viv√®s] imagines the story in its main arcs, the intentions of the characters, the way the action will evolve, then talks about with the other two: Balak is in charge of the storyboard, cuts the album into episodes, in the way of a TV series season [‚Ä¶] Finally, Micha√´l [Sanlaville] draws 20 sheets weekly with Bastien, and everyone checks everyone else‚Äôs sheet\\". The narration rhythm is based on that of a TV series‚Äô: \\"We try to adapt to the rhythm of quickly fast produced and aired TV series, like The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones‚Äôs adaptations. And as for this, we really have to bow down to Balak, who rapidly creates and storyboards without losing anything of his quality\\". The main line of comics concluded with its twelfth volume, released on the 20th of November, 2019. As of May 2020, First Second Books has only published the first six volumes of the series in English.

Reception  The series has received mixed review from both generalist and specialised press. Du9, who considers that the series is a success from a formal point of view, especially thanks to the \\"charm of Viv√®s‚Äôs typical feminine characters, whose beauty is sometimes only shown by a few strokes of the pencil\\", also thinks that it \\"would be less likely that the series trigger the massive adhesion of children and pre-teen readers\\", the authors addressing \\"rather young adults or, more likely, geeks nostalgic of Japanese series and/or being receptive to \\"fan service\\"\\". T√©l√©rama finds \\"the story efficient and funny, clearly inspired by Dragon Ball of Akira Toriyama \\". The Huffington Post points out that \\"Viv√®s uses the classical codes of martial arts tournament manga only to crush them more efficiently with his bearish and ruthless Aldana\\". The series has met with quite a success in Europe with nearly 100 000 volumes sold. 10 000 copies were distributed in USA in March 2015.  Adaptations and other media  = Adult animation (series) = An adult animated prequel to the comic book was produced thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign in the summer of 2016. The episodes were all aired on France 4, on Tuesday evenings from November 22 to December 14, 2016. The show was made available for streaming on Netflix in France and Belgium in 2018,https://www.netflix.com/fr-en/title/81003592 and also on the Mondo Media VRV channel in the United States. In June 2019, Viv√®s and Sanlaville confirmed that the animated series would be getting a second season. = Video game = A video game, Lastfight, developed by the independent publisher Piranaking, came out on September, 20th 2016.

Location The site of the old bridge across the Woodhill Burn at the Whin Gaw. Bailliehill Mount, also known as Woodhill Mount, at 60m in height overlooks Carmyle or Waterpark Farm and the Carmel Water with steep slopes to the NW and SE; it is partly wooded. The site has well preserved rig and furrow ploughing marks internally and externally to the NE. A farmer's access track with a bridge across the Woodhill Burn at the Whin Gaw ran to the site from the nearby lane to Knockentiber. Description Bailliehill Mount's summit has evidence of earthworks that are sub-circular with an earthen bank on all sides except the NW, with an interior height of around 0.5m and an exterior height of around 2.3m. An entrance may have existed to the north where the bank seems to stop short of the steep slope although that section has been subject to landslips that may have removed evidence of this part of any bank. A short section of a second bank and ditch exists to the east however the degree of rig and furrow ploughing makes interpretation problematic. History Known locally as the 'Bullyhill' the site has been recorded as 'Bullahill' and 'Bellahill' in old church charters. Robert Linton and John Smith carried out some \\"superficial diggings\\" in the mid 19th century, Robert Linton, a geologist, being the first to formally identify the site as an earthwork. It was reported by Robert Linton that several stone coffins on the nearby lands of Carmyle or Waterpark were found within a cairn that was removed by the farmer and also effected by the building of the railway. These graves show the presence of people in this area for several millennia as do other prehistoric remains in the adjoining area of Knockentiber. The name 'Baillie' in its context of the baron-baillie, a member of a medieval lairds retinue has evoked suggestions of a link with moot hills however the name also appropriately and suggestively describes the bailey of a castle. The Ordnance Survey 'name books' of 1855 to 1857 record that locals believed that Baillehill had in the distant past been a site where \\"justice was administered\\". No coffins or human remains are recorded from the site. Views of Bailliehill File:Bailliehill Mount Iron Age hill fort - outer ditch - SE side.jpgOuter ditch and bank on the SE side.

She was a member of the French Resistance during WWII and she is a member of the Righteous Among The Nations.  Biography  Jeanne Maurier grew up in Annecy, France. Her father, a former combatant in World War I who had been gassed by the Germans, worked at the local prefecture in Haute-Savoie. At age 18, she wanted to study in Paris to become a nurse with the French Red Cross, but the declaration of war prevented her from pursuing her plans. = During the war (1939-1945) = After doing some other work, Maurier became a civil servant at the local Haute-Savoie prefecture in Annecy. She was assigned to the Refugee Naturalization Service, initially as an assistant, and later as a full-fledged employee. In 1941, she joined the newly created Refugee Service, which had been designed to help people who were just arriving to the region. In November 1942, a woman by the name of Suzanne Aron approached her for help with her ID cards. Her husband, Francis Aron, a reserve officer in the army who was injured in 1940 and received the Legion of Honor, had burnt their ID papers so that, as Jews, they would have to wear the yellow star. Suzanne Aron also needed ID cards for the three daughters of Henri Schilli, the rabbi of Valence, France, who were under her care. Maurier began to make fake ID cards, four of them under the name Caron, and three for the Schilli daughters under the name Sureau. The girls, as well as the Aron children, found a hiding place in the farm belonging to Jeanne's maternal grandparents. By February 1943, Maurier was helping young men born in 1919, 1920, and 1921 to escape the call for mandatory service. Through her job at the prefecture, she obtained a night pass, which allowed her to travel past curfew. After seeing at work the names of the young men who were to be summoned for mandatory service, she took advantage of her night pass in order to go and warn the families. During that period, men started to arrive from other regions to hide in the mountains. She provided them with fake ID cards, which listed their place of birth as either being a French city that had been bombed, or a town in North Africa, in order that their civil status could not be verified. In March 1943, Maurier met Genevi√®ve de Gaulle, who was looking for someone who could distribute newspapers clandestinely. She helped de Gaulle furnish falsified documents to the men who refused to comply with mandatory service. She helped refugees cross the border into Switzerland with the assistance of some of the Annemasse-Geneva railroad workers, the Protestant community in Annemasse, and the wife of the Protestant pastor, Jeanne Bach. In September 1944, Maurier married Jean Brousse, a colleague from the prefecture who worked in the office of the prefect. He had previously been imprisoned, along with other men, during a French militia raid. = After the war = Jeanne Brousse- Attestation- Righteous Among The Nations .1973 After the war, Rabbi Schilli, now head of the Israeli Seminary of France, testified about Brousse's role in saving his life as well as those of his three daughters: Fran√ßoise, Nicole, and Danielle. In 1973, the state of Israel awarded Brousse the title of Righteous Among The Nations. In 1974, the General Consul of Israel in Paris bestowed on her the medal of the Righteous Gentiles, and she was invited to plant a tree at the Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem. In 1981, Brousse was one of the founding members of the French chapter of the association of the Righteous Among The Nations. In 1987, she joined the French Yad Vashem committee, of which she remained the Vice President for several years. She was also the honorary president of the \\"Heroic Saviors of Haute- Savoie.\\" She participated in the \\"Concours national de la r√©sistance et de la deportation,\\" sharing her experience in schools and during National Day Against Racism and Antisemitism ceremonies. She was a member of the jury for the departmental competition on resistance and deportation. Very active in these associations, Brousse also served as secretary of the local chapter of the Veterans of the Secret Army, as well as for the Union of Volunteer Combatants of the Resistance. On 2 November 1997, in the presence of Catherine Trautmann, the spokesperson for the French government, Brousse inaugurated the National Memorial of the Righteous in Thonon-les-Bains. In March 2005, Brousse accompanied the official French delegation led by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin to attend the inauguration of the new Yad Vashem Museum in Jerusalem dedicated to the Shoah, in the presence of Simone Veil. Jeannette Maurier- Brousse - Shoah Memorial in Paris Jeannette Maurier-Brousse- U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum - Washington Her name can be found on the Wall of the Righteous in the M√©morial de la Shoah in Paris, inaugurated in 2006 and is included on the Wall of Honor of Rescuers of the Holocaust in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 2008, the Circus Theater paid Brousse homage with its play The Rebellious Righteous. On April 18, 2014, a new addition to the Haute-Savoie pr√©fecture, the Migration and Integration Services Building, was dedicated in her name. Jeanne Brousse in 2014 at the Pr√©fecture of Haute- Savoie Describing herself, Brousse said: \\"I am not a hero, I am not a lecturer.

Eison entered religious training when he was eleven years old, studying initially at Daigo-ji and later at Kong≈çbu-ji. At the age of 34, while at Saidai-ji, he made the decision to become a fully ordained monk. However, since the process of ordination in Shingon Buddhism had been lost by this point in time, Eison decided to self-ordain, and along with three companions performed his own ordination ceremony at T≈çdai-ji in 1236. After spending some years as a travelling priest, Eison returned to Saidai-ji and founded the Shingon Risshu sect. Saidai-ji prospered under his governance, receiving increased donations and revenue despite Eison's vows of poverty. In later years, Eison also accepted donations of land from the Retired Emperor Kameyama. These generous donations may have been the result of Eison's response to the Mongol invasions of Japan, in which he performed esoteric rituals to repel the invaders. In honour of this, his disciples commissioned one of the earliest examples of a juzo (portrait of a living monk), sculpted in wood. In 1273, 1275 and 1280, despite his advancing years, Eison made pilgrimages to the Ise Grand Shrine, where he presented copies of the Daihannya-kyo Sutra. After his death in 1290 he was given the posthumous title Kosho Bosatsu (ËààÊ≠£Ëè©Ëñ©). Eison is known as the founder of the ≈åchamori tea rite, an unusual variation of the Japanese tea ceremony that uses over-sized tea utensils. The story goes that in the year 1281, Eison received an imperial order to conduct prayer rites for Japan‚Äôs protection against the second attempted Mongolian invasion. Eison responded with rituals inciting Aizen My≈ç≈ç to intervene and disperse the Mongolian invaders to foreign lands. By good fortune, the invading ships capsized and Japan avoided calamity. Following this event, on the final and sixteenth day of the New Year‚Äôs Mishih≈ç ritual for the protection of emperor and state, Eison proceeded to the Hachiman Shrine on the grounds of Saidai-ji to perform a H≈çsan rite of thanks for having been protected from potential harm. Just as Eison concluded the ritual, powdery white snow fell from the sky, transforming the scene into one of breathtaking beauty. Seen as an omen, Eison made a tea offering at the front of the shrine as a display of reverence. After the tea was dedicated to the deity, it was offered to the crowd gathered before the shrine. Due to the large numbers, Eison used a huge tea bowl to distribute the tea to all present. This is the origin of Saidai-ji‚Äôs ≈åchamori tea rite.

Unlike other South African electronic music, gqom is typified by minimal, raw and repetitive sound with heavy bass beats but without the four-on-the-floor rhythm pattern. Music connoisseurs who embraced the new sound included the likes of South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat, Italian record label Gqom Oh owner, Malumz Kole, Afrotainment record label owner DJ Tira, as well as Babes Wodumo with the music taste-maker and personal public relations liaison, Cherish LaLa Mankai. Related artists include Distruction Boyz. Name and characteristics The word gqom derives from an onomatopoeic combination of click consonants in the isiZulu meaning a hitting drum. It is also expressed as qgom, igqom, gqomu or variants thereof. Gqom is known for its beats which have a minimal, raw and repetitive sound with heavy bass. It is mainly described as having a dark and hypnotic club sound. The style of beats does not use the four-on-the-flour rhythm pattern which is often heard in other house music. Typical lyrical themes include nightlife. It often uses one phrase or a few lines which are repeated numerous times in the song. Gqom was developed by a young generation of technologically skilled DJs producing in D.I.Y. fashion with software such as FL Studio and often self distributing their music on file sharing platforms. From the mid-2010s the genre gained prominence abroad, especially in London. Dance moves Gqom music is associated with a number of distinctive dance moves, including gwara gwara, vosho and bhenga. = Gwara gwara = Gwara gwara is performed by rolling and swinging the arm and the elbow in terms of making a circle, and one of the leg moves in connection with the arm's rhythm. It has some similarities to the Stanky Leg. The dance move created by disc jockey and producer DJ Bongz, was heavily imitated by South Africans and other African people mainly during 2016. It also received widespread globally as the choreography was adopted by notable musicians: Rihanna performed the dance move while performing Wild Thoughts at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018. Childish Gambino performed the dance in the video of his song \\"This Is America\\".

Recorded after Pynn helped restore submarines in a Southampton military museum, where he discovered the job that an \\"afterplanesman\\" is given on board a submarine, Pynn \\"saw his position\\" and named the album accordingly. Playing most of its instruments on the album, Pynn also collaborated with Tom Arnold, and a total of eighteen musical instruments feature on the album, including traditional folk and experimental instruments. The tracks on the album are said to form a \\"suite-like movement;\\" several of the tracks on the album use abstract structures, and sampled voices are occasionally used to emulate melody and deliver deadpan poetry, accompanying the music's ethereal sounds. Surreal sound effects such as playing cards also feature on the album. Afterplanesman was released to critical acclaim, with critics finding the album to be a successful experiment. The Sunday Times included the reissue on their list of the 100 best albums of 2008, and Stewart Lee included the album on a list of his thirteen favourite albums of all time.__FORCETOC__ Background After beginning his career in the mid-1980s, Nick Pynn became known in the 1990s for his \\"avant-folk\\" music and usage of musical instruments he created himself, recording the albums In Mirrored Sky (1995) and Music for Windows (1999) for Roundhill Music, which were subsequently re-released as a double album in 2007. He also recorded collaboration albums with Richard Durrant in 1997 and Jane Bom-Bane in 2002, and began performing in \\"pick up bands\\" for stand up comedians such as Rich Hall and Stewart Lee, the latter of whom, when speaking about Afterplanesman, commented: \\"He's got all these different instruments that he's made himself, and dulcimers that he's salvaged, and things like a coconut that he's strung and he puts them all through loops and makes this music that's like folk music but too arty.\\" In 2003, Pynn got a job helping to restore submarines in a Southampton military museum, where he discovered that an \\"afterplanesman\\" who \\"the man who sits and keeps the [submarine] balanced by looking at the bubble in the spirit level.\\" This was when Pynn decided to create Afterplanesman. Lee commented that he thought Pynn \\"saw his position\\" as the afterplanesman. Pynn premiered a solo show in 2003 called Music from Hotels Rooms, Forests and Submarines, in which Pynn, playing household objects as musical instruments including playing cards, wine glasses, and live sampling, in addition to his various stringed instruments; the show formed the template of his concept for Afterplanesman, and used many of the same instruments and music. Musical style Afterplanesman is experimental and largely instrumental; few of its songs feature singing, and vocals are generally used for effect, such as with \\"Joker Jack\\", an example of several songs on the album which use \\"the patter of everyday speech to create something close to a melody.\\" Pynn's own vocals, which feature on \\"Grace\\", are spoken word and spoken in a \\"dreamlike deadpan\\" that complemented the accompanying ethereal sounds. Several songs on the album have no song structure at all, an example being \\"Nocturne,\\" an eerie, atmospheric song. Sarah Meador of Rambles has nonetheless conceded that \\"always there is poetry, and some interaction of voice and music that carries a piece beyond spoken word.\\" The music on the album is said to be \\"haunting rather than catchy\\" and each track is said to work cohesively within the album \\"like movements in a suite.\\" One critic described the music on the album as \\"art folk.\\" Eighteen musical instruments were used on Afterplanesman, mostly played by Pynn but several by collaborator Tom Arnold. Indeed, Musician magazine noted: \\"There are certainly surprises in store: violins, poetry, acoustic guitar and playing card sound effects on the surreal 'Joker Jack'.\\" The Sunday Times noted the album's usage of self made instruments and sampled vocals which \\"range across cultural, geographical and temporal boundaries.\\" Pynn himself plays the acoustic and electric guitar, 10-string bouzouki, lap dulcimer, wine glasses, ode, violin, mandocello, theremin, mandolin and pedalboard on the album. \\"Heriot Row\\" works its way through minor and diminished chords before reaching \\"a happy-sounding conclusion.\\"Musician magazine, March 2015 The eerie \\"Nocturne\\" makes use of only a theremin and vocals. Release and reception Afterplanesman was originally released on Roundhill Music in May 2004, but was re-released on 10 November 2008, and received critical acclaim. Describing the album as \\"a daring experiment, and a successful one,\\" Sarah Meador of Rambles was favourable, saying \\"Afterplanesman is less an album than a tour of strange places, exotic landscapes grown with sound and populated with voices on the edge of familiarity. It's an enchanting trip, and won't use up your vacation time.\\" She felt the album was \\"much different than a standard music recording.\\" Musician magazine \\"highly recommended\\" Afterplanesman, calling the album \\"richly varied and wonderfully played with an intriguingly elusive style\\" and noting that \\"production companies should sit up and take note - this would sound very good indeed on films and programmes.\\" The 2008 reissue of the album featured on The Sunday Times' list of \\"The 100 Best Records of 2008.\\" The newspaper said: \\"Pynn gave his micro-suite of miniature art-folk curios a push this year. Sampled vocals and self-made instruments range across cultural, geographical and temporal boundaries to delightful effect.\\" In a 2011 list curated for The Quietus, comedian Stewart Lee, whom Pynn has worked with, included Afterplanesman in a list of \\"His 13 Favourite Albums.\\" Describing the album as bearing a \\"polite dignity,\\" and commenting that its both his and his wife Bridget Christie's favourite Pynn album, he commented that the music was hard to categorize: \\"It's like something that might be in the Wire except it's a bit too melodic, it's sort of like singer/songwriter stuff but there's no words. It's sort of a bit like John Cage or something, except that there's too many tunes.

He is known for his correspondences with Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria who was his closest ally. Qatna was at its height during I≈°·∏´i-Addu's reign, which was, however, plagued with revolts in the southern parts of the kingdom and with constant war with Yamhad, Qatna's northern neighbour. Reign I≈°·∏´i-Addu is mainly known from his correspondences with Mari for a period of six years between c. 1783‚Äì1778 BC. When his reign began is uncertain; he succeeded Amut- pi æel I, who is most probably his father. Qatna was at its apex during the reign of I≈°·∏´i-Addu; he was the overlord of Hazor, and the many kingdoms of Amurru which controlled the central Levantine coast between Byblos and Ugarit acknowledged his authority. I≈°·∏´i-Addu was a close ally of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria who conquered Mari and installed his son Yasmah-Adad on its throne. The alliance between Qatna and Assyria was concluded shortly after Yasmah-Adad installation; it was cemented by the c. 1782 BC marriage of Dam-·∏™ura·π£i, I≈°·∏´i- Addu's daughter, to Yasmah-Adad. The dowry of Qatna's princess was huge and I≈°hi-Addu demanded his vassals to contribute; a tablet discovered in Hazor contains orders from Qatna for the providing of large quantities of commodities such as textiles, objects made of precious metals and weapons. Since early in their history, Qatna and Yamhad shared a hostile relation; the situation worsened during I≈°·∏´i-Addu's reign and evolved into border warfare. Qatna occupied the city of Parga in the region of Hamath for a while before Sumu-Epuh of Yamhad retook it. In the south, I≈°·∏´i-Addu faced a general rebellion; after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent an army to help I≈°·∏´i- Addu dealing with the rebellion. Shamshi-Adad planned to send an army of 20,000 soldiers and for his son Yasmah-Adad to lead them leadership, but these plans could not be realized. Instead, a much more modest army was sent under command from generals who were put in the service of I≈°·∏´i-Addu in c. 1781 BC. The Assyrian troops avoided engaging Yamhad and did not participate in its war with Qatna while I≈°·∏´i-Addu took up residence in Qade≈° to oversee the suppression of the rebellion, which apparently was supported by Yamhad. A fortress near lake Qattinah was named after the king \\"Dur-I≈°·∏´i-Addu\\". The archive of Mari contains many letters from I≈°·∏´i-Addu to Shamshi-Adad and his sons; in one of them, the king of Qatna tried to persuade Yasmah-Adad to join him in conquering three cities, telling his son in law that a big booty awaits them. There was also an incident where Yasmah-Adad detained messengers from Qatna causing Shamshi-Adad to write a sharp letter to his son ordering him to release the messengers. After four years in the service of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad ordered his troops back and it might be connected to a peace treaty between Assyria and Yarim-Lim I, son of Sumu-Epuh; I≈°·∏´i-Addu, who in the past declared that \\"even if Shamshi-Adad would conclude peace with Sumu-epuh, I will never make peace with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!\\", was delivered a heavy blow. The sources of Mari are silent on how the king dealt with the situation that resulted from Shamshi-Adad's peace with Yamhad, and by the time they resumed mentioning Qatna in c. 1772 BC, I≈°·∏´i-Addu was dead and succeeded by his son Amut-pi æel II. Personality Judging by his letters, the king had a great ability to whine whenever he felt insulted; shortly after Shamshi-Adad's death, tension between I≈°·∏´i-Addu and the Assyrian king's eldest son Ishme- Dagan I occurred. The king of Assyria asked for two horses from Qatna, and it seems that I≈°·∏´i-Addu asked for something in return, but Ishme-Dagan sent a small amount of the horses real value and seems to not have met I≈°·∏´i-Addu's request causing the latter to write an angry message, which was apparently intercepted in Mari by Yasmah-Adad who had interest in keeping his brother and father in law at peace. His letters concerning his daughter also reveal a man capable of compassion; he wrote Yasmah-Adad: \\"I am placing in your lap my flesh and my future. Your maid i have given you, may god prove her attractive to you. I am placing in your lap my flesh and my future, for this throne ('house') has now become yours and Mari's has now become mine\\".

She was the mother by Poseidon, of the twins Aeolus (Hellen) and Boeotus.  Mythology  There are various accounts of what happened to Melanippe after the birth of her sons. In one version, when her father discovered her pregnancy, he handed her over to a man from Metapontium, who was childless and adopted her sons as his own. When the boys grew up, a civil war began in Metapontium and they seized the kingship. They also killed Autolyte, their adoptive father's wife, for having mistreated their natural mother.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.67.3‚Äì4 Strabo cites two other accounts, in which Melanippe was said to have been handed over either to Metabus or to Dius.Strabo, Geographica 6.1.15 In another version of Melanippe's story, when her father discovered that she had given birth to twins, he blinded her, shut her in a prison and ordered that the babies be exposed. However, they were suckled by a cow and survived. They were subsequently rescued by shepherds, who later gave them to Theano, wife of King Metapontus of Icaria, as she was looking for a baby to present to her husband as her own, fearing that he would expel her if she bore him no children. Later, however, she did give birth to two sons, but Metapontus was already more fond of the sons of Melanippe. So when they grew up, Theano instructed her natural sons to kill Aeolus and Boeotus during hunt. The two, however, defended themselves and, with the aid of Poseidon, killed Theano's sons. She then committed suicide and the brothers fled to the shepherds who had found them. Having found out about their true descent from Poseidon, they released their natural mother Melanippe from prison, and Poseidon restored her sight.Hyginus, Fabulae 186 Two tragedies by Euripides, Melanippe The Prisoner and Melanippe The Philosopher, were dedicated to this character.

It has been recognized as the oldest western-style blast furnace in Japan, and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the Sites of Japan‚Äôs Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining. UNESCO World Heritage Convention Sites of Japan‚Äôs Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining History During the Bakumatsu period, ≈åshima Takat≈ç, a samurai/engineer from Nanbu Domain, was hired by Mito Domain to construct modern western-style mortars. However, the project failed due to the inferior quality of iron produced by the reverberatory furnace he produced in Mito Domain in 1855. He returned to Morioka, and assisted by an engineer on loan from Satsuma Domain, built a new western-style blast furnace near local deposits of magnetite in 1857. The furnace was based on a design found in the Dutch engineering text Het Gietvezen in s'Rijks Ijzer-Geschutgieterij'te Luik by Huguenin. Although the project was technically successful, the Tokugawa shogunate did not pursue further development due to the Mito rebellion and the suppression of western- style innovation during the Ansei Purge by the tair≈ç Ii Naosuke. The new Hashino blast furnace was turned by the shogunate to Morioka Domain in April 1859. Morioka Domain quickly expanded operations, constructing two more blast furnaces to produce 1125 tons of pig iron per year, using over 1000 workers, making it the largest smelter in Japan at the time. Although most of this iron was intended for weapons production, the domain also produced coinage on behalf of the government. When an order came from the government in 1868 to cease production, Morioka Domain continued to mint coins illegally on a large scale through 1869. This came to an end in 1871 after the Meiji restoration and the abolition of Morioka Domain, and the No.1 and No.2 blast furnaces were closed at that time. In 1894, the remaining blast furnace was absorbed into the Kamaishi Tanaka Metals Company and was later closed as well. The site fell into ruins, and was excavated in 1955. It received protection as a National Historic Site in 1957. The American Society of Metals recognized the site as a historical landmark in 1984, noting its contribution to the development of the Yawata Iron and Steel Works. In 2015, it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and was portrayed by actress Jerrika Hinton from 2012 to 2017. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, later renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Stephanie works her way up to resident level with fellow intern and friend, Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington). The character was described by Hinton as \\"innovative\\" who strives to be the best. The love rectangle between Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), April Kepner (Sarah Drew) and Matthew Taylor (Justin Bruening) and herself, her relationship with neurosurgeon mentor Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), her friendship with Jo, her childhood illness as well as her struggles with burnout have been focal points of her character. Background Stephanie was born with sickle-cell disease. At the age of five, she was put in a clinical trial at St. Jude that used bone marrow transplants to treat the disease. The treatment was very effective for her and Dr. Keith Wagner, who ran the study, called Stephanie one of the most successful stories from the trial. Her memory of the trial is resisting and being told it was for her own good. There were even times when they had to strap her down to get her to accept the treatment. She cried everyday and became depressed. As a result of her non-existent childhood, Stephanie ultimately clung to books and used this as inspiration to pursue a career in medicine as a doctor. In high school, Stephanie was a cheerleading captain and led her team to victory. She went to college on a cheerleading scholarship. Storylines Stephanie starts her internship at Seattle Grace Mercy West after the plane crash. She and the other interns come to fear Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and refer to her as \\"Medusa\\". While working on the case of Graham Cunningham, Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) allows Stephanie the opportunity to do a procedure, even saying that Stephanie is better than Shane. When Bailey steps in, Cristina backs off, but ultimately decides to let Stephanie close, over Bailey's objections. While competing with Leah while they are both on Cristina's service, they both are indefinitely banned from the OR when their fighting led to Leah hooking up a patient's oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake. When it seems like the hospital is going to be sold, Stephanie starts looking at programs at other hospitals because she wants to be the best and to be the best, she has to learn at the best program. In the tenth season, Heather dies and Stephanie is given time off like the other interns to grieve. She gets eye surgery after she feels her glasses got annoying. Later, Stephanie works on Meredith's portal vein trial. Stephanie sides with Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) in surgery over Stephanie and Meredith decides she does not want to work with her anymore. Stephanie is invited to April Kepner (Sarah Drew)'s wedding. She questions the logic of her not inviting Jackson and questions whether they're not truly over each other. Jackson assures her otherwise, but tells April he loves her at the wedding, humiliating her in front of everyone. Jackson later apologizes after he is married to April. Stephanie works with Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) on a case of SCID. The patient Braden Morrin's parents consent to them using deactivated HIV as a vector to deliver an enzyme to his body, but before the procedure is done, his mother withdraws consent. Despite this, Bailey proceeds with the procedure, because she knows he won't get better without any treatment, contrary to the belief of his parents. When Braden's t-cell count jumps overnight, Stephanie confronts Bailey about it and Bailey confirms to her that she had done the treatment without consent. When Bailey comes clean to the parents, Bailey and Stephanie are both involved in legal meetings. When the parents announce their intent to sue and get Bailey's medical license revoked as well as charging her with assault and battery, Stephanie takes the blame, saying that she didn't tell Bailey that the parents had revoked consent and Bailey was covering for her. They drop the charges and Stephanie is suspended for a week. In the eleventh season, Stephanie finds a mentor in Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) as she becomes highly interested in neurosurgery. Edwards is forced to give April and Jackson the news that their baby will die. Amelia and Stephanie make it their mission to remove Nicole Herman (Geena Davis)'s seemingly impossible tumour. Amelia manages to remove the tumor, but after several days, Dr. Herman still does not wake up. Stephanie figures out that Dr. Herman had a small stroke, but luckily Dr. Herman eventually wakes up, but is completely blind. Amelia instructs Stephanie to live on the high and not beat herself up, as they beat the impossible. She finishes by declaring themselves \\"superheroes\\". Stephanie tries her hardest to make her patient remember the pilot with whom she fell in love with in a plane crash. In the twelfth season, Stephanie must help a patient recover from brain surgery, which brings back bad memories from her childhood of when she was a sickle-cell experiment participant. Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a \\"reason\\" for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle‚Äôs case when Amelia finds out that they‚Äôre a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk. Later, she learns Kyle is back in the hospital with suspected meningitis, chose not to tell her and angrily refuses to let her be involved. Stephanie and Kyle reconcile, right before Amelia is unable to save his life in surgery. In the thirteenth season, Stephanie is surprised by Leah's return. Stephanie and Alex go against the wishes of religious parents who do not want to treat their sick child. Stephanie has an argument with the father, trying to tell him that if anything, God delivered Liam safely for them to treat him, but the father exclaims that she will burn in Hell. She lashes out and throws a tablet at the wall near the father. Eliza Minnick gets Stephanie's privileges revoked and she goes into therapy. Stephanie returns from therapy earlier after only 3 sessions, but ends up being a hostage to a dangerous patient named Keith who raped another patient. He holds a scalpel to her throat, demanding to escape the hospital. Stephanie is unable to evacuate with him due to a lockdown by Bailey to find them. Keith decides to light a fire to escape. While he‚Äôs distracted trying to get the flames close enough to set off the sprinklers, Edwards makes a move and douses him in the remaining alcohol and sets him on fire. Edwards grabs the little girl with them, and they get to safety in a room off the hall, but then she sees the man is dangerously close to a flammable cylinder. She warns the little girl to stay put and runs out to try and prevent it, but she is not fast enough and an explosion occurs, with Edwards' fate hanging in the balance. She manages to escape the fire, and saves Erin's life, but suffers significant burns. After saving Erin's life, she collapses. While getting treatment, she quits her job to explore and travel, and thanks Webber for changing her life, but she needs to move on to see the outside of a hospital as it was her whole life. Development =Casting & Creation= Hinton was cast in 2012 as the role of Stephanie Edwards. The episode's initial script read-through took place on July 16, 2012. In 2016, Hinton was poised to exit to star in an ABC pilot series Toast but it was passed on and she returned as a regular in season thirteen. On January 31, 2017, it was announced Hinton would depart after the thirteenth season ends after being cast in Alan Ball's new untitled HBO series. =Characterization= After Jackson professes his love for April at her wedding sitting next to Stephanie, Hinton described it as the \\"worst kind of betrayal. It‚Äôs one thing to say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been harboring these feelings and I thought I dealt with them but I haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôm actually involving you in this decision.‚Äô But it‚Äôs another thing to devastate someone in such a public way in front of people that she has to work with the very next day.\\" Hinton expressed enthusiasm for being a part of the storyline involving Dr. Nicole Herman's tumour with neurosurgeon mentor, Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) in the eleventh season. Hinton said, \\"It's been a while since I've been this excited because playing the jilted lover, that was something, but now I get to sink my teeth into something! And I love when I get to do research, and the things that Stephanie is involved with now‚Ä¶somehow or another Grey Sloan is always the place with groundbreaking medical discoveries.\\" Hinton elaborated further on Stephanie's journey in her first 3 years saying, \\"She got to be a part of Meredith's (Ellen Pompeo) 3D printing lab, she got to be a part of Bailey's (Chandra Wilson) genome project, and now she's going to get to be a part of this third gigantic thing.\\" Hinton spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about Stephanie's relationship with Kyle in the twelfth season. On Stephanie's decision to end the relationship, Hinton said, \\"She has to let it go and walk away because of the pure reality of the situation: Kyle came to her as a sick person and while they were able to mitigate some of that, the circumstances of his illness mean that he will continue to deteriorate, which means he'll continue to require more care. For a person like Stephanie, she is so driven and so young. This is the logic of a younger person. She doesn't have the capacity to give Kyle what he needs. Even in this week's episode, we see Stephanie try: He's sick and she brings him into the hospital and does the thing she knows how to do ‚Äî medicine. She tries to do the thing she knows how to do and she's stopped at every turn because her superior says she's too close to this case. \\"This is personal and you can't keep apart the personal and the professional here, so I'm moving you off this.\\" That's a devastating blow for someone who always thinks that she knows the right way. Granted, she trained under a fantastic mentor [Amelia] and she does know the right way to do things. So to be told, \\"You are not capable,\\" is devastating. That will continue to be the uphill battle she fights, both in trying to carve out her career aside from Kyle and even more so in the relationship with him. She's not capable of doing both; she just can't. So she chooses her career. Let's also point out that it's not like they've been dating for a year; they've been together for maybe six weeks. She's considering every bit of reality at her disposal. And it's not an easy decision.\\" Reception After the airing of the ninth season, Natalie Abrams for TV Guide assessed the 5 new interns introduced and whether to get rid of them or not. Judging Stephanie, Abrams assessed, \\"Keep her for now\\", and suggested to get rid of Jo and Shane instead. Speaking further, Abrams said, \\"She has seamlessly been able to infiltrate the core group by... well, sleeping with one of them. Her fling with Jackson (Jesse Williams) has been a fun storyline that recalls the early days when [Meredith and Cristina] sleeping with their own attendings. [...] [she] could [...] fall victim to being the other woman [with Jackson and April]. But that potential storyline could be a fun respite from a season otherwise dominated by the sale of the hospital.\\" In the twelfth season, Caroline Siede for The A.V. Club felt that \\"Without a love-interest or a trusted mentor, Stephanie is a bit un-moored at the moment. And on a show all about interconnectivity, that will hopefully allow her to stir things up a bit.\\" Siede praised Stephanie and Kyle's (Wilmer Valderrama) break-up as well as Hinton's portrayal later in the episode ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Gonna Need Someone On Your Side‚Äù. She assessed: \\"In her final conversation with Jo she explains that after spending so much time as a helpless patient when she was a kid, she took control of her life by forging a new identity as a doctor. Going back to that ‚Äúpatient‚Äù (or in this case, patient‚Äôs loved one) identity is too painful for her [...] even though I wasn‚Äôt particularly invested in their relationship beforehand, I was unexpectedly moved by their breakup. There‚Äôs something selfish about Stephanie‚Äôs decision to walk away, but I can also completely understand her rationale. Selling the audience on both a relationship and its breakup is a pretty impressive feat for one episode to pull off and Jerrika Hinton deserves a lion‚Äôs share of the credit for that.\\" Writing for \\"At Last\\", Siede was disappointed that the relationship between Kyle and Stephanie wasn't explored more but enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, as well as the tragedy of his death. She noted the \\"quiet dignity to Stephanie‚Äôs grief that I‚Äôm excited to see Hinton explore in the future.\\" Gwen Inhat, writing for The A.V. Club praised the character in her notes for \\"True Colors\\" questioned, \\"Is Stephanie alive or dead? Since Jerrika Hinton is moving on, I wouldn‚Äôt put anything past this show. But if Stephanie goes down a hero, that was an awesome way to go. Will really miss that actress and character.\\" Lauren Hoffman for Cosmopolitan felt the scenes involving Stephanie being a hostage and getting into an explosion were \\"wildly over the top, but it's the first time I've felt true, scary suspense during a Grey's episode in a really long time\\". Maggie Fremont for Vulture assessed the episode saying, \\"if I shed any tears during ‚ÄúTrue Colors,‚Äù they were out of fear for Stephanie‚Äôs safety as Keith dragged her around a mystifyingly empty hospital. That got real.\\" In the thirteenth season finale, Hinton made her final appearance as Edwards. Inhat for The A.V. Club assessed that her absence would be felt. Maggie Fremont for Vulture said, \\"it‚Äôs tough to bid farewell to one of the show‚Äôs best characters, especially one who didn‚Äôt always get her due. Both Stephanie and Jerrika will be missed.\\" Justin Kirkland for Entertainment Weekly felt that \\"Stephanie Edwards is possibly in the top three most tragic Grey‚Äôs Anatomy characters of all time. Think about it ‚Äî left by her boyfriend at a wedding, lost her boyfriend (and then was given essentially zero plot time to assess that loss), did the heavy lifting for a surgeon who was in crisis during one of her most important surgeries (shout out to Dr. Herman), and here we are, presumably dealing with our natural-haired, crazy-talented, third-wave intern star lying somewhere next to a rapist, crisp as they come. Oh, Stephanie. You deserved better.\\" On a more critical note, Lauren Hoffman for Cosmopolitan felt that while she enjoyed Hinton's performance, Edwards was underutilized compared to earlier interns like \\"Izzie and George\\" and that it was \\"hard to make a character you only really get to play every few weeks feel like yours and I understand why [Jerrika is] moving on. I'm also happy her character got to do so without getting murdered or fired, although she's probably going to be legitimately traumatized by the part where she burned a rapist to death? But I'm so confused about why Stephanie cited her childhood spent in hospitals as the reason she had to get out of surgery. That was her reason for getting into surgery. It just feels like lazy writing (or a willful ignorance of Stephanie's backstory).\\"  References   External links  * Stephanie Edwards on IMDb Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional African- American people Category:Fictional female doctors Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Stephanie Edwards (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"54060164","text":"Bishop Patrick Cleary Bishop Patrick Cleary SSC, DD (3 March 1886‚Äì23 October 1970) was an Irish missionary priest who served as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nancheng, China. An educator, he established a seminary in Nancheng. In 1949, the People's Republic of China was established, which resistant to foreigners and western religion. He continued to run the mission until 1952, when he was imprisoned and then expelled from China. He returned to Ireland where he returned to teaching at St Columban's College seminary. Early life and education Patrick Cleary was born on 3 March 1886 in Kildysart, County Clare. He had two sisters, who became Nazareth nuns, Sister Margaret and Sister Hildegard, and a brother John. Educated locally and at St. Flannan's College, Ennis, Cleary studied for the priesthood at St Patrick's College, Maynooth. Ordained in 18 July 1911 for the Diocese of Killaloe, Dr. Cleary received a Doctorate of Divinity in 1914. His dissertation was The Church and Usury. An Essay on Some Historical and Theological Aspects of Money-Lending (1914). Career =Ireland= For four years, until 1918, he was a professor and the chair of moral theology in Maynooth. He then taught at the St Columban's College seminary in Dalgan in County Galway of the Maynooth Mission to China, later known as the Missionary Society of Saint Columban. In 1918, the Columban Fathers was formed and he was among the first group of men to join. For eleven years, beginning in 1919, he was the rector. =China= He served the Society in Nancheng, China beginning in 1931, replacing the martyred Columban priest Cornelius Tierney who had been kidnapped by communist guerrillas and subsequently died. After arriving in Nancheng, he wrote to a friend that \\"It is simply delightful, with a charming church, a compound full of buildings that would house an army.\\" While in China, his primary activity was teaching students at his seminary. The courses that he covered were theology, scripture, canon law, philosophy, and the English language. On 21 July 1933, he was appointed Prefect Apostolic. He became Vicar Apostolic in December 1938 and the following April he was ordained a bishop. At times he was at odds with the \\"Roman\\" model or approach for operating the church. For instance, while a bishop, he did not adopt the approach to build congregants by taking in and baptising abandoned children. During World War II (1939-1945), according to an obituary, he aided people that needed assistance, including Doolittle's Raiders, who had crashed near the city in 1942 after bombing Tokyo. One month after the rescue, the city was attacked and Cleary nearly died several times. The entire city was burned in retaliation for having aided Doolittle's men. He aided anyone that needed help, including Chinese and Japanese people. In 1942, Cleary established the Nancheng Relief Committee. In Nancheng, he became the first bishop of the Diocese of Nancheng in 1947 on the feast day of the Most Holy Rosary. He became the Most Reverend Patrick Cleary. On 1 October 1949, the People's Republic of China was established. In a drive against foreigners, his and other religious figures began to lose their personal freedom in December 1950. Rural churches began to be repurposed to granaries or meeting places for the communists. He stayed in China until 15 December 1952, when he was expelled held under house arrest for one year, imprisoned, and taken to court on \\"trumped up charges\\" of being an imperialist and oppressor after he refused to join a communist-sponsored church. After being found guilty by the court, he was taken to Hong Kong and then returned to Ireland after stopping at Tokyo in 1953. Two of the Chinese priests that served with him were still in prison when he left. Cleary was left frail and unsteady after the ordeal. During his time in China, he never took a vacation or left the country. Personal and later life According to Brendan O Cathoir of the Irish Times, Cleary defended Terence MacSwiney following his fatal hunger strike. MacSwiney had been elected Lord Mayor of Cork as an Irish Republican in 1920; due to his political ties, MacSwiney was interned following the election and soon after sentenced to two years in prison for ‚Äúseditious activity.‚Äù In protest, MacSwiney went on a hunger strike hoping to draw attention to British policy in Ireland. MacSwiney would die still custody after lasting 74 days on hunger strike.Jason Perlman. \\"Terence MacSwiney: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Hunger Strike\\". The New York State Historical Association. Archived from the original on 4 December 2008. Cleary made clear that though he did not support hunger strike as means to suicide (long considered a mortal sin by the Catholic Church), he considered it to be ‚Äútheologically justifiable,‚Äù if used to draw attention to Britain‚Äôs oppressive policy towards Ireland at the time.Jason Perlman. \\"Terence MacSwiney: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Hunger Strike\\". The New York State Historical Association. Archived from the original on 4 December 2008. After 1952, he returned from China to teaching at St Columban's. In June 1957, after returning from China, he ordained William Patrick Kinane in Thurles, Ireland at the Cathedral of the Assumption. He attended the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). Cleary died on 23 October 1970 at St Columban's in Dalgan and was buried in the Missionary Society of Saint Columban Cemetery, in Navan.

The NWU is a \\"working\\" uniform, which means that is made to a more durable and utilitarian standard, thus being worn in lieu of more formal and delicate uniforms that might get unduly damaged or dirtied in the process of normal military duties. Made from a ripstop nylon- cotton blend, there are currently two variants of the NWU in use by the U.S. Navy. They are the NWU Type II, which is primarily brown and tan and is designed to be worn in sandy, arid, and desert battlefield environments, and the NWU Type III, which is primarily black and green in hue and is designed to be worn in more temperate environments such as the contiguous United States. The first NWU variant, known as the NWU Type I, was designed in late 2004 and began being used by the U.S. Navy in limited quantities beginning in late 2008. By late 2010, it had completely replaced most other \\"working\\" uniforms. Though the NWU Type I was originally intended for shipboard use, it soon was dropped from that role when it was realized that the uniforms were not suitable for such duties due to their lack of flame resistance, as fires are a serious threat to sailors aboard a warship. Instead, the U.S. Navy's sailors wear specialized flame-resistant coveralls when working shipboard. Due to its lack of flame resistance making it unsuitable for shipboard use, the NWU Type I was retired from use in 2019, being replaced by the NWU Type III. The NWU Type II is worn by specialized units such as the Navy SEALs, Seabees, and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, whereas the NWU Type III are worn by all U.S. Navy sailors, regardless of rank or billet. The NWU Type III has been issued to new naval recruits since late 2017 and completely replaced the NWU Type I in 2019, when the latter was discontinued and phased out of service. Background As a standing professional military force, the U.S. Navy has three main categories of uniforms for its members to wear, referred to as dress, service, and working. Dress uniforms are elaborate, designed to be worn during formal occasions of prestige and state, in that regard, they are roughly analogous to a civilian tuxedo or a three-piece suit. Service uniforms are more casual, designed to be worn in everyday contexts, such as in office buildings. Working uniforms are more durable and utilitarian, designed for use in battle and environments where other more formal clothing would be impracticable and might get unduly damaged or dirtied. Prior to the NWU's introduction in late 2008, the U.S. Navy's sailors and officers wore three main working uniforms: The coveralls, which were worn by all sailors and officers and were made from a blue polyester and cotton blend fabric; working khakis, also known as wash khakis, which were tan in color and worn by officers and chief petty officers only; and utilities, which consisted of a light blue shirt and dark blue trousers and were worn by seamen and petty officers only. During this time there were also various other working uniforms that were available to U.S. Navy sailors to wear, such as the winter working blue (consisting of a black shirt and trousers) and aviation working greens (an olive green jacket and trousers worn with a tan shirt and black tie), but these were rarely worn. In late 2010, the NWU replaced all of these uniforms with the exception of the coveralls, which are still worn today in the polyester/cotton version and a newer flame-resistant version. In addition, some sailors, such as U.S. Navy corpsmen wear the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform when assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps unit. Other sailors, such as Navy SEALs, SWCC, and Seabees, formerly wore the Battle Dress Uniform and Desert Camouflage Uniform when in operating areas, both of which have since been largely replaced by the NWU Type III and NWU Type II respectively. Design The NWU comes in three main components, the blouse, trousers, and a hat known as an eight-point cover. The uniforms are made using a fabric bearing a camouflage pattern reminiscent of computer pixels, the version designed for use in arid dry areas known as AOR-1 and the version for use in lush woodland areas known as AOR-2. The blouse is worn over a short-sleeved T-shirt, brown for NWU Type II and NWU Type III, and blue for the NWU Type I. The NWU is worn with a pair of boots, black for NWU Type I, and tan for NWU Type II and NWU Type III. However, the NWU Type III is worn with black boots if the wearer is in the borders of the contiguous United States. The overall blue color of the NWU Type I, according to the U.S. Navy, reflects the U.S. Navy's heritage and connection to seaborne operations. The colors were also chosen to match the most commonly used paint colors aboard ship, extending the lifetime of the uniform on long deployments where uniforms often come into contact with freshly painted surfaces. The pixelated pattern was advertised as ostensibly being able to hide wear and stains, something unavoidable with the utilities and working khakis used previously. As of 2012, the uniform is authorized for wear outside of military installations. The uniform is primarily composed of a ripstop 50/50 nylon and cotton blend, which eliminates the need for a \\"starch and press\\" appearance and reduces the possibility of snags and tears from sharp objects (thus making the garment last longer). However this blend combines high flammability with the strength to hold onto the sailor's body while burning. All-weather garments include a unisex pullover sweater, a fleece jacket, and a parka, all of which are available in matching camouflage patterns. Beginning in 2016 the Navy had planned to also issue a lightweight version of the NWU Type I more suitable to hot environments. Black safety boots, identical to those worn by the U.S. Coast Guard with their Operational Dress Uniform, are worn with the NWU Type I. Brown or tan boots can be authorized for wear with the Type II and III, though black is the standard color of boot for sailors located in the contiguous United States. The black boots come in two versions: black smooth leather boots, and black suede no- shine boots for optional wear while assigned to non-shipboard commands. The NWU Type I uniform is worn with rank insignia on both collar points and on the front panel of the cover, with sew-on name and \\"U.S. NAVY\\" tapes, also on the new digital background pattern, having gold-colored lettering for officers, CPOs and midshipmen. All sailors with rates below CPO (E-7) wear silver- colored name tapes. An embroidered logo depicting an anchor, , and eagle, known as an \\"ACE\\" emblem is stitched onto the left breast pocket on all Type I NWUs. The ACE on the pocket is omitted from the NWU Type II and NWU Type III. The NWU Type III has its rank insignia in the form of a slip-on piece of fabric displayed on the chest between the breast pockets. The NWU Type III also is worn with an embroidered U.S. flag on the right sleeve pocket flap, and an embroidered First Navy Jack flag patch on the left sleeve pocket flap. Also on the NWU Type III, name-tapes and badges are placed and sewn onto the blouse, but can be attached via hook and loop fasteners, similar to the Army Combat Uniform. =Durability= Like the previous working uniforms, the NWU is designed to allow personnel to stay warm and dry in inclement weather, thus they are designed to be slightly larger for the wearing of sweaters underneath. The NWU, unlike its predecessors, was also designed to be longer- lasting and does not need to be ironed like previous uniforms. The uniform also has more pockets than its predecessors, with four on the shirt including the two pockets on the sleeves of the uniform, and six on the trousers. The NWU Type I was phased into service beginning in late 2008 and through to January 2009. History Master Chief Petty Officer of the U.S. Navy Rick D. West in August 2010, wearing an early version of the NWU Type III featuring rank insignia on the collars and not on the chest =2003‚Äì2004: Development= From 26 February 2003 to 20 September 2003, the U.S. Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, William J. Fallon, directed the U.S. Navy to create a survey group under the name of \\"Task Force Uniform\\" to begin conducting a study of the U.S. Navy's then-current uniforms to see if any of them should be replaced by newer, more contemporary ones. From this study and subsequent initiative, the NWU and Navy Service Uniform (NSU) were created. More than a year the Task Force Uniform initiative was created, early versions of the NWU, still in its prototype stage, were publicly unveiled before a crowd of sailors for the first time on 18 October 2004 aboard , by Master Chief Petty Officer of the U.S. Navy Terry D. Scott. Overall, the NWU prototypes that were showcased in late 2004 and early 2005 were similar to the BDU and DCU uniforms used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force at the time. =2005‚Äì2006: Testing= There were originally four prototype variants of the NWU, two of each which had their own different camouflage patterns. One variant, known by the developmental moniker of NWU-C, used a more traditional blob-like \\"analog\\" camouflage pattern that was essentially a blue, black, and gray version of the US Woodland. The other prototype variant, known as the NWU-D, used a pixelated blue-dominant camouflage pattern reminiscent of the U.S. Marine Corps' MARPAT and U.S. Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern. Two uniforms featured rounded collars like those founded on the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, the other featured more sharper, pointed collars reminiscent of those found on the Battle Dress Uniform and Desert Camouflage Uniform. Two variants featured pockets on the sleeves near the shoulders and removed the lower row of pockets on the blouse, whereas two other variants kept the lower row of pockets and featured no sleeve pockets, like on the BDU and DCU. The NWU-D variant was selected to become the NWU. In addition to the different pockets, different collars, and different camouflage patterns proposed, there were two different variants of hats proposed as well. One hat was a flat-topped patrol cap reminiscent of that used on the U.S. Army's BDU. The other was an eight-point utility cover like those worn by the U.S. Marines. The early NWU prototype uniforms were tested throughout late 2004 and into 2005 over a period of six months by a test group of select U.S. Navy sailors. In early 2006, the U.S. Navy's Chief of Naval Operations, Michael G. Mullen, selected the pixelated blue camouflage pattern with pointed blouse collars and an eight-point cover to become the NWU's finished product. =2008‚Äì2009: Introduction= The NWU Type I, known then as simply the NWU, began being made available to U.S. Navy sailors in late 2008 and early 2009. It completely replaced most of the U.S. Navy's other working uniforms by late 2010. In March 2006, the U.S. Navy set the introduction date for the NWU as late 2007, but that date was ultimately pushed back by almost a year to late 2008 and early 2009. =2010‚Äì2011: Expansion= In January 2010, the Navy began using new camouflage patterns for the Navy Working Uniform derived from MARPAT, named Type II and Type III, desert and woodland, respectively. The new patterns were approved the previous year, in 2009. These patterns are overall darker than their respective MARPAT progenitors, modified with different color shades and a vertically-aligned pixel pattern for the woodland version, as opposed the horizontal alignment of woodland MARPAT. The additional patterns addressed the fact that the blue and grey Type I pattern was not meant for a tactical environment. Rank insignia is embroidered and worn on a tab in the center of the torso, name and \\"U.S. Navy\\" taps are embroidered in brown (Type II) or black (Type III). Further rules were detailed when NAVADMIN 374/09 was released: the Type II is restricted for wear to Naval Special Warfare personnel, while Type III was restricted to Navy ground units until late 2016. =2016‚Äì2019: Reorganization= In August 2016 the U.S. Navy announced that it will be eliminating the NWU Type I in favor of the Type III which completely replaced it on 1 October 2019 for wear as the standard working uniform for all Navy personnel ashore. Type III NWUs began being sold across the U.S. and issued to new U.S. Navy recruits and officer candidates from October 2017 onward, with production of the NWU Type I being ended. The Type II will remain restricted to wear by Naval Special Warfare sailors in arid desert environments. The New York Naval Militia mirrored the Navy's policy of phasing out the NWU Type I in favor of the NWU Type III. The Ohio Naval Militia automatically follows the regulations set forth by the Department of the Navy and will phase into the new uniform on the same timescale as the Navy. In 2018, the eight-point cover used with the Type III NWU began featuring the Anchor, Constitution and Eagle (ACE) logo in place of the rank or rate insignia previously worn, similar to the Eagle-Globe-Anchor insignia is worn on the eight-point covers of the U.S. Marine Corps' combat utility uniforms. In October 2019, the ACE logo completely replaced rank insignia on the NWU Type III's eight-point cover. Future The U.S. Navy's original goal of developing a single working uniform for wear shipboard and ashore, for which the NWU Type I was found to be unsuitable because of its lack of flame resistance, has largely been abandoned. With the NWU Type III having become the main shore uniform, the U.S. Navy continues to work to develop a new two- piece shipboard working uniform, prototypes of which were tested from May to September 2018. For the time being, sailors wear an improved flame-resistant variant of the coverall, known as the IFRV. Currently, the U.S. Navy has four prototypes in testing to replace the IFRV coveralls. Three are based on the former wash khaki and utilities worn until 2010, and the other is based on the NWU Type III though in tan and blue instead of camouflage.

His repertoire consisted mostly of French and Italian opera, in which he directed some of the world's great singers including Pauline Viardot, Christina Nilsson, Marcella Sembrich, the brothers Edouard and Jean de Reszke, and Feodor Chaliapin in the opera houses of London, Paris, Melbourne, St. Petersburg, Boston and New York. He retired around the time when sound recording became commercially available, and he seems not to have left any recorded legacy. Life Pauline Viardot He was born in Legnano,Some sources say Livorno, possibly confused by 'Leghorn', its English translation. northern Italy. His father was probably named either Giovanni or Augusto. He studied music on the advice of Giovanni Pacini and Theodor D√∂hler. In 1857, he went to Paris to complete his musical training, armed with a letter of introduction to Gioachino Rossini from the famed soprano Giuditta Pasta. His first professional engagement was in London at the Theatre Royal (1858‚Äì9).Auguste Vianesi. Opera Scotland. Retrieved 15 May 2017. He also toured Britain with Pauline Viardot, including Verdi's Macbeth in Manchester with some locally engaged women for the role of the witches who had only acted in Shakespeare's play with music, and knew not a word of Italian or a note of Verdi's music. They were dismissed at the rehearsal and replaced by the (heavily disguised) prompter and a couple of orchestral musicians. Vianesi held further conducting positions in New York the same year (1858‚Äì9), Moscow (1863‚Äì4) and St Petersburg (1867‚Äì9). Returning to London, he conducted the Italian Opera for ten years at the Covent Garden Royal Opera House from 1870 to 1880 under Frederick Gye, with a season at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique in Paris in 1873. He conducted the first London performances of Lohengrin (1875), Tannh√§user (1876), Il Guarany (Antonio Gomes 1872), and Jules Massenet's Le roi de Lahore in 1879. He toured widely in Britain with the Covent Garden Italian Opera company.

As of 2017 the Tortit brand held a 6.7% of the Israeli candy bar market, second to Taami with 9.4%. History The product was launched by Elite in 1975. At that time, milk chocolate was marketed with a rum flavored cream under the brand name \\"Jamaica\\". In the same cream, the coated waffle is also used. The name of the snack is called Tortit because it resembles a torte cake in its structure. In 2017, Marwan Barghouti a Palestinian leader serving five life sentences for terrorism offenses in an Israeli jail was filmed surreptitiously eating a Tortit bar while on a declared hunger strike. The Israeli Pizza Hut subsidiary ran an ad posing the question \\"Barghouti: If you‚Äôre going to break the strike, isn‚Äôt pizza better?\\", however Strauss (the owner of the Elite brand) decided not to use for the incident for advertising.

She was a noted educator, co-editing a chemistry textbook written by Ida Freund, as well as being one of the nineteen signatories to a petition to the Chemical Society arguing for admission of women as Fellows of the Society.  Career  Thomas' father was \\"Wild William\\" Thomas, a surgeon and Professor of Anatomy at Mason College, Birmingham, and he encouraged her to pursue chemistry. Thomas attended King Edward VI High School and then attended Newnham College, taking the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1897 and 1898. She then became a demonstrator at Royal Holloway College for two years, joining (and eventually succeeding) Dorothy Marshall. In 1901 she studied at Birmingham having obtained a Priestley Scholarship, after which she returned to Cambridge to teach chemistry at Girton College. Her work here was noted later by one of her students, Dorothy Needham (who graduated in 1919): > \\"It seemed that in the period at the end of the First World War the schemes > followed in the Girton laboratory for experimental chemistry were > incomparably better planned and organized than those available in the > University Chemical Department, which then for the first time had replaced > most of the separate College laboratories. This famous laboratory at Girton > finally closed in 1935 when Miss Thomas retired, and the building can still > be seen, though it is now used for other purposes.\\" While Thomas is remembered for her work in education, she did publish with Humphrey Owen Jones on the stereochemistry of optically active nitrogen compounds. However, pressures of teaching meant that her efforts shifted to education, although she did carry out some development work on anti-gas respirators during World War I. As well as working to develop chemistry education at Girton, Thomas was a co-editor of Ida Freund's posthumously published book Experimental Basis of Chemistry. Thomas also organised the Ida Freund Memorial Fund. Thomas and Freunds' close friendship meant that although Thomas taught at Girton, she had input into the chemistry teaching at Newnham, where Freund was based, and a Newnham college student wrote that: > \\"Fortunately for Newnham science students, Miss Thomas was able to undertake > our supervision in chemistry so that we were able to appreciate her > qualities as a teacher.\\" After Thomas died in 1935, the laboratory at Girton College - the last college laboratory in existence - closed.  The 1904 petition to the Chemical Society  In 1904, Thomas, along with eighteen other British women chemists, signed a petition setting out their reasons to the Chemical Society why they should be afforded Fellowship status like their male counterparts. The petition eventually led to the admission of women as Fellows of the Society (one of the Societies that amalgamated to become the Royal Society of Chemistry), as well as identifying prominent female chemists working in Britain at this time. Thomas also found a means to make a personal protest, by way of not paying education rates levied on house-holders.

The song title is a reference to Cyril Knowles, a left back who played for Tottenham Hotspur. It was released before the 1973 Football League Cup Final where Tottenham played Norwich City. It reached No. 14 on the British single chart after Tottenham won, and its writers Spiro and Clarke received an Ivor Novello Award for Best Novel or Unusual Song in 1974. Origin In 1972, Wonderloaf Bread created a television advertising campaign written by Peter Mayle with the slogan \\"Nice one, Cyril\\", where the slogan was used to congratulate a baker named Cyril for baking a good loaf of bread. The slogan was picked by fans of the football club Tottenham Hotspur, who chanted \\"Nice one Cyril\\" to praise a Tottenham player named Cyril Knowles. Harold Spiro, a fan of the club, wrote the song with Helen Clarke based on the slogan. They also used the folk song \\"Farewell, Ladies\\" for the music in the chorus. The song was performed by the Cockerel Chorus (the cockerel is the emblem of Tottenham Hotspur) fronted by Spiro, with Jamie Phillips singing the opening operatic part. It is also the first professional recording of future Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain. Chart performance The song was released in 1973 before Tottenham reached the League Cup Final. It entered the chart at No. 43 on 24 February 1973. It peaked at No. 14 a month later after Tottenham won the League Cup 1‚Äì0 against Norwich on 3 March 1973. Popular culture Due to the popularity of the TV slogan and the song, \\"Nice one Cyril\\" became a popular catchphrase in the 1970s used to praise someone. In Cockney rhyming slang it was adopted to mean \\"squirrel\\", and it was the title of the autobiography of Cyril Fletcher, The phrase continued to be used in later decades, but limited to those named Cyril or similar; the refrain of the song \\"Nice one Cyril, nice one son\\" was used as a tribute to another footballer Cyrille Regis in 2018. The \\"Nice one Cyril\\" chant used by Tottenham fans for Cyril Knowles is also used for another Tottenham player Son Heung-min, reworded as \\"Nice one, Sonny, nice one Son / Nice one, Sonny, let‚Äôs have another one.\\" References Category:1973 singles Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. songs Category:Football songs and chants Category:1973 songs Category:Songs about sportspeople Category:Cultural depictions of association football players Category:Cultural depictions of British men ","title":"Nice One Cyril"},{"id":"54060789","text":"Wait for It could refer to: Entertainment *\\"Wait for It\\" (How I Met Your Mother), an episode of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother **\\"Wait for It\\", a catchphrase of Barney Stinson, a character in the show *\\"Wait for It\\" (song), a song from the musical Hamilton *\\"Wait for It...

Born to a family of petty Samogitian gentry, Po≈°ka attended Kra≈æiai College and worked as a lawyer. He dedicated the last decade of his life to cultural work. He had wide interests in the Lithuanian language, culture, and history. He collected archaeological artifacts and antiques and stored them in Baublys (plural: Baubliai), which is considered to be the first Lithuanian museum. Po≈°ka wrote many works but during his life he published only a letter poem and two articles on history. His most famous work is epic poem \\"The Peasant of Samogitia and Lithuania\\" (Mu≈æikas ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos). He also compiled a trilingual Polish‚ÄìLatin‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary but did not finish it.  Biography  A Baublys at Bijotai manor, a museum of Dionizas Po≈°ka Until 2004, the place and date of the birth of Po≈°ka was unknown. His year of birth was subject to varied speculations that ranged from 1745 to 1775. In 2004, historian Povilas ≈†verebas discovered Po≈°ka's baptismal records of the ≈Ωemalƒó church. He was born in the manor between Tel≈°iai and Ma≈æeikiai in a family of petty Samogitian gentry and was baptized in ≈Ωemalƒó on 13 October 1764. His childhood passed at his parents' estate in Mald≈´nai (≈†ilalƒó district). Between 1773 and 1780, Po≈°ka studied in Kra≈æiai College. Later he studied law at the barrister's and until 1821 held various offices at the courts. In 1786 Po≈°ka became a lawyer. Since 1790 till his death Po≈°ka lived in a small estate of his own in Bard≈æiai (Raseiniai district) near , where he possessed around 500 ha of land and had 40 serfs. In 1792, Po≈°ka married Ur≈°ulƒó Sasnauskytƒó. They had no children. Po≈°ka was actively corresponding with professors of Vilnius University, bishops, poets, writers and other cultural figures of Lithuania. Po≈°ka died in 1830 and was buried in Kaltinƒónai cemetery (≈†ilalƒó district municipality) near his wife. Baublys Po≈°ka was a person of wide interests. He knew Lithuanian (native Samogitian dialect), Polish, Latin, Ancient Greek and other languages. His special interest laid in the past of Lithuanian nation, its language, spiritual and material culture. Po≈°ka collected ancient artifacts from archaeological excavations, military arms of the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian coins, medals and other rarities. A library of rare Lithuanian- language books was too collected by Po≈°ka. At the beginning of the 19th century Po≈°ka cut down an oak, that was growing in his estate, when the oak began to dry up and hollowed its trunk thus making a hut for the collection of his antiquities, that was called by Po≈°ka himself ‚Äì Baublys (Baublys in Lithuanian means someone or something, who/that make a low roar, rumble), because of a characteristic sound when the wind was blowing through this trunk. In 1812 in this carved oak tree he established the first historical museum in Lithuania. Later more old oak trunks were carved for the collection of Po≈°ka to store. This museum soon became widely known not only in Lithuania, but also abroad and played an important role in encouraging Lithuanian nobility and the rest of Lithuanians to study the past of Lithuania. Today Baublys is a working museum, that depicts one of many initiatives of Lithuanian nobility during the Romanticism period, when the interest in the history of Lithuania was growing. Po≈°ka was one the first Lithuanian nobles, who felt interested in various Lithuanian antiquities. Literary work Po≈°ka was writing in his native Lithuanian and in a nobility language of the time ‚Äì Polish language. During his lifetime, he himself did not publish much or tried to preserve his writings, thus part of his works and translations were lost. His literary heritage consists mostly of historical, philological and fiction works. Po≈°ka was collecting historical books in Lithuanian language, wrote his own works on Lithuanian past, language, ethnography and mythology. From 1825 to his death he was working on a trilingual Polish‚ÄìLatin‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary. The unfinished dictionary consists of more than 25,000 words. The last entry is sanie (sled). The fiction works of Po≈°ka vary in form: they consist of long poems as well as short epigrams. The most famous literary work of Po≈°ka is \\"The Peasant of Samogitia and Lithuania\\", that was written by him during a ten-year span between 1815 and 1825. Today Po≈°ka is respected in Lithuania not only as a creator of the first Lithuanian historical museum and one of the first poets, who wrote in Lithuanian language, but also as one of initiators of the early 19th-century informal Lithuanian cultural movement to revive the Lithuanian culture and Lithuanian language, the so-called Samogitian-Lithuanian revival (≈Ωemaiti≈°kas lietuv≈°kasis sƒÖj≈´dis). Po≈°ka also coined some neologisms, that are still used in Lithuanian language and was making first attempts of standardisation of Lithuanian language.

He is the son of anti-Apartheid activists Amina and Yusuf Cachalia, and a relative of former African National Congress (ANC) MP Ismail Cachalia.  Early life  Cachalia was born in Johannesburg in 1956, and grew up in the ghettos of Vrededorp, Fordsburg, and Nugget Street. He was sent to Waterford School in Swaziland, in order to avoid the education offered under the \\"apartheid system of Indian Affairs\\". However, his schooling there was interrupted when the South African government threatened him with \\"passport issues\\" because of his parents' involvement in anti-Apartheid activism. He was sent abroad to stay with his uncle and aunt in Britain, where he was forced to remain for ten years. While overseas, he completed his O Levels, received a scholarship to the United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, and then went on to study history at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies. He campaigned in the Anti- Apartheid Movement. Upon completion of his studies, he returned to South Africa, and went to the University of the Witwatersrand to study law, a degree which he did not complete. While at the university, he joined the Black Students Society and became its vice-president.  Business  Cachalia joined his father's business, which supplied school uniforms for black students, and completed an apprenticeship at a clothing manufacturing facility in Johannesburg, then opened such facilities in Malawi and Mozambique. In the late 1990s, Cachalia sold the businesses, which could not compete with clothing manufacturers from Asia in terms of price and supply. He retained only one retail outlet, whose shareholding he transferred to the company's employees; the business still runs in Johannesburg's central business district. He then entered into management consultancy in Zurich, Switzerland, and in Johannesburg.  Politics  Cachalia had been a lifelong supporter of the ANC. However, he had become increasingly disillusioned since the Arms Deal controversy, and now believes that the ANC cannot be saved from the \\"kleptocracy\\", corruption and self-interest that have come to characterise the party. This led him to turn to the DA, who he had \\"always valued\\" \\"as a loyal opposition\\". He joined the DA as an ordinary member in early 2016, and ran as the DA's mayoral candidate for Ekurhuleni in the 2016 municipal elections, on a platform of transparent and accountable government. He lost to the ANC's candidate by only 11 votes. In April 2017, Cachalia laid a criminal charge of incitement and intimidation against Ekurhuleni Mayor, Mzwandile Masina, for threatening white anti-Zuma protestors with violence, and requested that the Ekurhuleni Council Speaker, Patricia Khumalo, investigate the matter. He was sworn in as a DA MP on 4 May, 2017, and Philip de Lange took over the DA leadership in Ekurhuleni. = Positions = Cachalia considers himself \\"a liberal with a small L\\". He supports freedom of expression, and has defended Helen Zille in that respect, whom he has characterised as well-intentioned. He considers the Economic Freedom Fighters \\"social fascists\\".

Roosevelt's political positions were diverse but his name has been generally deployed by politicians who wish to publicly align themselves with Roosevelt's record of conservation. In terms of specific policies, being a \\"Roosevelt Republican\\" has been described as supporting the conservation movement and having sympathies for environmentalist measures aimed at protecting natural landscapes. This is said to entail an emphasis on hunting and fishing along with wildlife tourism under the backdrop of government ownership of certain lands, with a more limited room for more invasive uses of public areas such as mining. Individuals who have self-identified as such include Ryan Zinke, a Montana politician and U.S. Navy veteran who became the 52nd U.S. Secretary of Interior on March 1, 2017.

Waveless picking is a form of \\"batch picking\\" where items for multiple orders are collected, or picked, together at the same time to be divided into separate orders at a later time in the process. The collection of items is called a \\"batch.\\" Historically, the terms wave picking and batch picking have been synonymous as wave picking is a means of achieving batch picking. Batch picking, both wave and waveless, reduces the travel or motion associated with fulfilling orders in a distribution center. Motion is ‚Äúnon-productive‚Äù and one of the 7 wastes identified in lean processing. Batch picking provides great advantages when individual orders are of just a few units and where items are located over great areas as would be found in modern eCommerce operations. In such circumstances, the required work, effort and time is reduced by having a travel path where pickers collect items from the required locations in a \\"batch\\". However, the efficiency gained by picking the batch is reduced by the effort to separate the gathered items into orders. This profile is common in direct-to-consumer e-commerce operations. Some operations may use an automated storage and retrieval system that allows material to be delivered to complete orders; however, these operations also often benefit from batching items for multiple orders.  Batch Creation  The distinction in wave and waveless fulfillment is the means in which the batch is created. In both cases, the batch represents a collection of items required for a set of orders. In a wave-based system, a collection of orders for a batch is determined, also known as selected. Next, the individual items required for the set of orders are identified and included in the batch. The size of the batch is limited to ensure that the batch may be sorted. When including the order items in the batch, the collection of items may be grouped into multiple task lists. Each task list is optimized to minimize the required travel to collect the items. The entire batch is called a wave and the wave is complete when all the required items have been obtained. In both a wave and a waveless operation, the size of the batch is limited by the ability of the downstream sorting process to separate out the items. Items arriving at the sorting process may come in an undefined sequence, and the sorting system must then be able to hold an early arriving item until the latest required item arrives for the order. If newly arriving items do not have a place to be held while awaiting the later arriving items, they must be set aside until a consolidation space becomes available. In a waveless system the \\"batch\\" of orders is ever evolving; new orders may be added to the batch as existing orders have been completed. This is called a revolving batch where the batch size is dynamically specified by the warehouse execution system. With this continuous flow of items through the revolving batch, as one order is completed another order is added to the process. With wave picking order completion is bunched up at the end of the wave while with waveless picking order completion occurs continuously.

He and his family relocated to Indian Territory in 1837, where he was employed in business and also served as an interpreter and developed a keen interest in Chickasaw politics. In 1856, he was elected to his first term as Governor of the newly established Chickasaw Nation His accomplishments included organizing a national government after the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation formally separated into two distinct entities. He also executed a formal alliance between his nation and the Confederate States of America after the outbreak of the American Civil War. After the cessation of hostilities, he played a major role in the recovery of the nation from its devastated condition. He retired from politics in 1874, after serving his fifth term as Governor.

Relocation to Indian Territory Early in the 19th Century, the Federal Government began its attempts to force Native Americans out of their homelands in the Southeastern United States to a sparsely settled area that they had reserved for them across the Mississippi River. It was officially known as Indian Territory. In 1818, the Chickasaws became the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to sell their lands in Kentucky and Tennessee to the government. Each received a twenty-year annuity of $1,000 for their share of the tribal land. By 1830, the Federal Government was putting heavy pressure on the Chickasaws to move from their homes in other Southeastern states to Indian Territory. Their close relatives, the Choctaws, had already signed the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek to move from Mississippi. Fluent in both English and Chickasaw, Cyrus Harris became useful as an interpreter in the many meetings with government officials to discuss details of the removal. Cyrus, himself, moved in November, 1837, and settled along the Blue River in what is now Johnston County, Oklahoma, where he opened a mercantile business.\\"Cyrus Harris (1827-1888).\\" Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame. 2012.

The Chickasaw Nation adopted a new constitution in August, 1856. According to Meserve, there were several candidates in the 1856 election for Governor, but none received a majority of the popular vote. Thus, the choice was left to the Legislature, which selected Cyrus Harris by a majority of one vote. Harris spent the majority of his two-year term organizing the new government. He ran for a second term in 1858, but was defeated by Dougherty Colbert. Cyrus Harris was elected Governor again in 1860. During this term, the American Civil War broke out. The Chickasaws were the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to openly favor the Confederacy. Governor Harris signed the resolutions supporting secessions from the Union on May 25, 1861.

Above the head of the reservoir natural conditions prevail; below it the water level above the riverbed has been raised by the impoundment and its flow rate reduced, unless and until banks, barrages, weir sluices or dams are overcome (overtopped), whereby a less frictional than natural course will exist (mid-level and surface rather than bed and bank currents) resulting in flash flooding below. In principle, a distinction must be drawn between the head of a reservoir impounded by a dam, and the head of a works resulting from a barrage or canal locks.  Head of a reservoir  None apply to embankment (storage/settling) reservoirs, to which water is pumped from below. Otherwise, a head's location varies with the height of the water level against the dam. Since there is only an extremely low flow within the reservoir so no water level gradient, the head can be clearly seen: where the farthest watercourse discharges into the reservoir. Upstream of the actual reservoir is likely to be a pre-dam, which typically have a constant water level so the head is reinforced.  Head of a works  On large rivers in all but arid climates, the head of a works is rarely fixed rigidly, as, within the impounded reach a significant flow rate and water gradient is sometimes seen. The head can only be found by calculation or defined by observations with and without impoundment. Depending on the flow rate and control of the barrage, locks or weir, position will greatly vary and will not necessarily be where the so-called headworks are. Many rivers (such as the Moselle) are barraged many times to make them navigable and/or to avoid uncontrolled flooding. In such a case only the higher stretches of river are uninfluenced by impoundment. As to the other stretches the river has long \\"level\\" pounds but no or few natural heads, instead having artificial structures until the top head. Ideal management of the higher heads will allow headroom to keep back some flood meadow water so as not to compound heavy precipitation and resultant run-off downstream; corollary channels with spare capacity are a further mitigation where land is at a premium (such as the Jubilee River). Ideal management of the lowest head will allow daily timed openings, at least in flood events, to coincide with an outgoing (ebb), rather than flood tide.

He began theater work as a call boy, or stagehand, at McVicker's Theatre in Chicago. After two years, he left to work for John E. Owens at the Variety Theatre in New Orleans.(14 April 1901). Last Words Heard by Lincoln, St. Louis Republic, image 24, col. 4. His first stage role was in 1859 in The Little Treasurer.Heck, Will S. (20 July 1907). Philadelphia, The Billboard, p. 19 (good source) He made his way back north with the onset of the American Civil War, and by the early 1860s he was appearing in billed roles including, for example, the role of Mark Meddle in London Assurance, and Davy in The Phantom.(10 December 1862).

Advertisement for Washington Theatre, p. 3, col. 6 (listing Hawk in role of Davy in The Phantom) Assassination of Lincoln On tour with Laura Keene's stage company in 1865, he had recently gained the title role in the company's production of Tom Taylor's play Our American Cousin, playing the role of Asa Trenchard. That role was best known for being played by popular comedian Joseph Jefferson, as part of the company Keene used to debut the play in America in 1858. The play remained popular for many years. Hawk was alone on stage in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865, delivering what was considered one of the funniest lines of the play. \\"Don't know the manners of good society, eh? Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!\\" which was delivered just after actress Helen Muzzy left the stage. Hysterical laughter began permeating the theater, and Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. John Wilkes Booth, an experienced actor, knew the line would draw much laughter, and used the opportunity to shoot, counting on the laughter to mask the report of his pistol. When Booth jumped down toward the stage, Hawk at first thought Booth was coming after him, and backed off the stage. Hawk knew Booth, and immediately recognized him. Evening Star Hawk was detained by the police and held on $1,000 bond, which Doctor Brown (the undertaker who later embalmed Lincoln) furnished for him. He was then brought to the Petersen House across the street from the theatre (where Lincoln lay dying), and confirmed to the police that Booth had been the assailant. Corporal James R. Tanner recorded the following testimony from Hawk: > I was on the stage at the time of the firing & heard the report of the > pistol. My back was towards the Presidents box at the time. I heard > something tear & somebody fell & as I looked towards him he came in the > direction in which I was standing & I believe to the best of my knowledge > that it was John Wilkes Booth. Still I am not positive that it was him. I > only had one glance at him as he was rushing towards me with a dagger & I > turned and run & after I run up a flight of stairs I turned and exclaimed > \\"My God that's John Booth.\\" I am acquainted with Booth. I met him the first > time a year ago. I saw him today about one o'clock. Said I \\"how do you do > Mr. Booth\\" and he says \\"how are you Hawk.\\" He was sitting on the steps of > Fords Theatre reading a letter. He had the appearance of being sober at the > time. I was never intimate with him. He had no hat on when I saw him on the > stage. In my own mind I do not have any doubt but that it was Booth. He made > some expression when he came on the stage but I did not understand > what.Onion, Rebecca (15 April 2015).

I turned, looked up at the President's box, heard the man > exclaim, \\"Sic semper tyrannis,\\" saw him jump from the box, seize the flag on > the staff and drop to the stage; he slipped when he gained the stage, but > got upon his feet in a moment, brandished a large knife, saying, \\"The South > shall be free!\\" turned his face in the direction I stood, and I recognized > him as John Wilkes Booth. He ran toward me, and I, seeing the knife, thought > I was the one he was after, ran off the stage and up a flight of stairs.

The book tells the story of Raval Kanhadade (Kanhadadeva), the Chahamana ruler of Jalore.  Textual history  Padmanabha wrote Kanhadade Prabandha in 1455, in a western Apabhramsha dialect. The author was a court-poet of Akhairaja, the Chauhan Rajput king of Visalnagar. Akahiraja is said to be a descendant of the poem's hero Raval Kanhadade, through Viramade, Megalde, Ambaraja, and Khetsi. The German Indologist Georg B√ºhler was the first modern scholar to write about this treatise. He noticed its manuscript in a Jain library at Tharad. Kanhadade Prabandha has been praised as the finest work in old Gujarati or old Rajasthani, and one of the greatest Indian works written during the medieval period by eminent scholars like Muni Jinavijaya, K. M. Munshi, Dasharatha Sharma and K.B. Vyas. The work was translated into English by V. S. Bhatnagar, a professor of History at the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur.  Plot  At the beginning of the text, Padmanabha invokes Ganesha and Sarasvati to grant him the ability to recount Kanhadade's story. He extolls the Sonagiri Chauhan lineage and their capital city of Jalore. = Ulugh Khan's raid of Gujarat = The author then describes the conquest of Gujarat by the Alauddin Khalji, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate: Gujarat was ruled by the Baghela king Rao Karnade. One day, Rao Karande humiliated his favorite minister Madhava, killed his brother Keshava, and abducted his wife. Madhava swore revenge and instigated Alauddin Khalji to invade Gujarat. Alauddin agreed to Madhava's plan and started planning an invasion of Gujarat. He sent envoys to all the kingdoms lying on the route connecting Delhi and Gujarat, requesting a safe passage for his army. Kanhadade of Jalore was the only king who refused to oblige to this request. He declared that allowing the Delhi army to pass through his kingdom would be against dharma because it would result in devastation of villages, enslavement of women, looting, and torture of cows and Brahmanas. Nevertheless, Alauddin's general Ulugh Khan marched to Gujarat with a huge army. The only Rajput who offered him any resistance in Gujarat was the Modasa chief Batada, who was defeated. Karnade, the king of Gujarat, fled his capital, following which the Muslim invaders destroyed the city's temples and converted them into mosques. Ulugh Khan then sacked Somnath, where all the priests died trying to prevent him from desecrating the city's Shiva temple. Ulugh Khan returned to Delhi with the Somnath lingam, which was to be smashed in Delhi in order to prove the superiority of Islam. = Kanhadade's victory over Ulugh Khan = Next, the poet describes how Kanhadade recovered the Somnath lingam: The goddess Parvati appeared in Kanhadade's dream, urging him to rescue the lingam, as Ulugh Khan's army passed through his kingdom. Kanhadade sent his spies to Gujarat, and learned that Ulugh Khan's army was one of the grandest armies ever, and had taken hundreds of thousands of Hindus as slaves. Kanhadade gathered all the chiefs from the neighbouring principalities, and attacked the invaders (who are described as asuras or demons). With the blessings of the goddess Ashapuri, Kanhadade and his brother Maladeo defeated the Muslims, recovered the Somnath lingam, and captured Ulugh Khan's nobles Sadullah Khan and Sih Malik. Kanhadade venerated the rescued lingam, and installed its five pieces at Soratha, Lohasing in Vagada, Abu hill, Saivadi, and a newly built temple at Jalore. This act made the god Shiva present throughout Kanahadade's kingdom. = Invasion of Sivana = Padmanabha next describes the Siege of Siwana (Sivana): When Ulugh Khan's defeated army reached Delhi, Alauddin sent an army led by his generals Nahar Malik and Bhoja to invade Kanhadade's kingdom. The army besieged the fort of Sivana, which was held by Satala. Satala defeated the invaders, killing Nahar Malik and Bhoja. Alauddin then personally led an army that besieged Sivana. One day, the goddess Ashapuri appeared in Kanhadade's dream, and showed him the invaders' camp. There, Satala saw Alauddin in form of the god Rudra-Shiva, and therefore, decided not to strike a blow against him. Facing a certain defeat, the women of Sivana committed suicide by self-immolation (jauhar), while the men fought to their death. = Furuzan's love for Viramade = The narrative of the poem now moves from war to love: After a skirmish between the armies of Delhi and Jalore, Alauddin decided to march to Jalore. His daughter Furuzan (also called Piroja or Sitai) told him that Kanhadade was the tenth incarnation of the god Vishnu, and would kill him if he tried to invade Jalore. Furuzan then expressed her desire to be married to Kanhadade's son Viramade. Alauddin tried to dissuade her, offering to marry her to any Muslim prince of Khan of Yogininagar (Delhi). But Piroza declared that she would either marry Viramade or die. Alauddin yielded to her demand, and sent his envoy to Jalore with a marriage proposal and a huge dowry that included the wealthy Gujarat province and 560 million of gold and silver coins. However, Viramade mocked Alauddin for trying to subjugate Jalore through a marital alliance rather than military might. He refused Alauddin's offer, declaring that his marriage to a Turkic woman would shame all the 36 Rajput clans and disgrace his ancestor Chachigadeva. Upon receiving Viramade's reply, Alauddin launched an invasion of Jalore. Kanhadade ordered the city of Jalore to be decorated so that Alauddin could see the grandeur and the might of his kingdom. The bastions of Jalore were decorated with silk sheets, the canopies were studded with jewels and pearls, the towers were adorned with golden spires, and the city was lighted with earthen lamps. The royal palaces and temples were whitewashed and decorated with beautiful wall paintings. Music, dance and theatre events were organized in the city. When Alauddin reached Jalore, he marveled at the heavenly city. Alaudin's first attack on Jalore was unsuccessful: Kanhadade's army captured the invading general Shams Khan and his wife, who was a sister of Furuzan. Princess Furuzan then told Alauddin that Viramade was her husband in her previous births, and insisted that she could secure the release of the captives by telling Viramade about their relationship in their previous births. Furuzan then described their five previous births, in which she had committed sati after her husband's death. She stated that in the sixth previous birth, Viramade had been born as Prithviraja, while she had been born as Padmavati. In this particular birth, she had committed two sins. First, she had killed a cow and conjured magical incantations to usurp power from her husband, which made him deranged. Second, she had usurped the power after ordering killings of all the ministers. After Prithviraja's death at the hands of Shihab al-din, Padmavati had committed sati in Ayodhya. Because of this act of punya (good deed), she had been born in Alauddin's royal family. However, because of her two sins, she had been born in a Turkic family. Furuzan then visited Kanhadade's kingdom, where she was received with great respect, courtesy and hospitality. However, Viramade even refused to look at her, and she accepted this as her fate because of the sins she had committed in her sixth previous birth. She managed to secure the release of Shams Khan and her sister. = Defeat of Kanhadade = Padmanabha then describes Alauddin's final invasion of Jalore: Alauddin conquered Jalore using treachery in 1311. Kanhade died in the battle, and women of the fort commit suicide by jauhar. Princess Furuzan had sent her nurse Dada Sanavar to save Viramade, if possible, or alternatively, to bring his head as a relic. Dada Sanavar found Viramade's body, put his head in a basket of flowers, and brought it to Delhi. When Viramade's head was presented before Furuzan in a plate, she remarked that earlier, Viramade had vowed not to even look at her face, but today, he would have to break his vow. However, the moment she came in front of Viramade's face, the head turned away. A sad Furuzan wept, and finally committed sati on the banks of the Yamuna River, holding Viramade's head in her hand. The poem concludes with a genealogy of Viramade's descendants.  Historical value  The poem contains authentic descriptions of the contemporary groups (such as Rajputs, Brahmins and Muslims), beliefs, festivals, social life, weapons and war strategies. This makes it a work of great historical value. However, its narrative about Piroja's love for Viramade is purely imaginary.

On IT-22,1 1976), by two Israeli computer scientists, Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv. This complexity measure is related to Kolmogorov complexity, but the only function it uses is the recursive copy (i.e., the shallow copy). The underlying mechanism in this complexity measure is the starting point for some algorithms for lossless data compression, like LZ77, LZ78 and LZW. Even though it is based on an elementary principle of words copying, this complexity measure is not too restrictive in the sense that it satisfies the main qualities expected by such a measure: sequences with a certain regularity do not have a too large complexity, and the complexity grows as the sequence grows in length and irregularity. The Lempel- Ziv complexity can be used to measure the repetitiveness of binary sequences and text, like song lyrics or prose.  Principle  Let S be a binary sequence, of length n, for which we have to compute the Lempel-Ziv complexity, denoted C(S). The sequence is read from the left. Imagine you have a delimiting line, which can be moved in the sequence during the calculation. At first, this line is set just after the first symbol, at the beginning of the sequence. This initial position is called position 1, from where we have to move it to a position 2, which is considered the initial position for the next step (and so on). We have to move the delimiter (starting in position 1) the further possible to the right, so that the sub-word between position 1 and the delimiter position be a word of the sequence that starts before the position 1 of the delimiter. As soon as the delimiter is set on a position where this condition is not met, we stop, move the delimiter to this position, and start again by marking this position as a new initial position (i.e., position 1). Keep iterating until the end of the sequence. The Lempel-Ziv complexity corresponds to the number of iterations needed to finish this procedure. Said differently, the Lempel-Ziv complexity is the number of different sub-strings (or sub-words) encountered as the binary sequence is viewed as a stream (from left to right).  Formal explanations  The method proposed by Lempel and Ziv uses three notions: reproducibility, producibility and exhaustive history of a sequence, that we defined here. = Notations = Let S be a binary sequence of length n (i.e., n symbols taking value 0 or 1). Let S(i,j), with 1\\\\leq i,j\\\\leq n, be the sub-word of S from index i to index j (if j\\\\exists j<{\\\\text{l(S), s.t. S(1,j) = Q .}} = Reproducibility and producibility = Image:Reproductibilit√©1.svg200pxthumbExample of reproducibility Click here On the one hand, a sequence S of length n is said to be reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) when S(j+1,n) is a sub-word of S(1,n-1). This is denoted S(1,j)‚ÜíS. Said differently, S is reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) if the rest of the sequence, S(j+1,n), is nothing but a copy of another sub-word (starting at an index i < j+1) of S(1,n-1). To prove that the sequence S can be reproduced by one of its prefix S(1,j), you have to show that: \\\\exists p\\\\leq j, {\\\\text{ s.t. }}S(j+1,n)=S(p,l(S(j+1,n))+p-1) Image:Productibilit√©.svg200pxthumbExample of Productibility Click here On the other hand, the producibility, is defined from the reproducibility : a sequence S is producible from its prefix S(1,j) if S(1,n-1) is reproducible from S(1,j). This is denoted S(1,j)‚áíS. Said differently, S(j+1,n-1) has to be a copy of another sub-word of S(1,n-2). The last symbol of S can be a new symbol (but could not be), possibly leading to the production of a new sub- word (hence the term producibility). Image:Prod_reprod1.svg200pxthumbComparison between reproducibility and producibility Click here = Exhaustive history and complexity = From the definition of productibility, the empty string Œõ=S(1,0) ‚áí S(1,1). So by a recursive production process, at step i we have S(1,hi) ‚áí S(1,hi+1), so we can build S from its prefixes. And as S(1,i) ‚áí S(1,i+1) (with hi+1 =hi + 1) is always true, this production process of S takes at most n=l(S) steps. Let m, 1\\\\leq {\\\\text{m}}\\\\leq l(S), be the number of steps necessary for this product process of S. S can be written in a decomposed form, called history of S, and denoted H(S), defined like this: H(S)=S(1,h_{1})S(h_{1}+1,h_{2})\\\\dotsm S(h_+1,h_{m}) H_{i}(S)=S(h_+1,h_{i}),i=1,2\\\\dotsm m, {\\\\text{where} }\\\\; h_{0}=0,h_{1}=1,h_{m}=l(S),{\\\\text{ is called component of } H(S)}. Image:Hist_exh&complexite1.svg;200pxthumbComparison between reproductibility and productibility Click here A component of S, Hi(S), is said to be exhaustive if S(1,hi) is the longest sequence produced by S(1,hi-1) (i.e., S(1,hi-1) ‚áí S(1,hi)) but so that S(1,hi-1) does not produce S(1,hi) (denoted ).S(1,h_{i}-1) rightarrow S(1,h_{i}) The index p which allows to have the longest production is called pointer. The history of S is said to be exhaustive if all its component are exhaustive, except possibly the last one. From the definition, one can show that any sequence S has only one exhaustive history, and this history is the one with the smallest number of component from all the possible histories of S. Finally, the number of component of this unique exhaustive history of S is called the Lempel-Ziv complexity of S.  Algorithm  Hopefully, there exists a very efficient method for computing this complexity, in a linear number of operation (\\\\mathcal{O}(n) for n=l(S) length of the sequence S). A formal description of this method is given by the following algorithm: * i = p - 1, p is the pointer (see above) * u is the length of the current prefix * v is the length of the current component for the current pointer p * vmax is the final length used for the current component (largest on all the possible pointers p) * and C is the Lempel-Ziv Complexity, incremented iteratively. // S is a binary sequence of size n i := 0 C := 1 u := 1 v := 1 vmax := v while u + v <= n do if S[i + v] = S[u + v] then v := v + 1 else vmax := max(v, vmax) i := i + 1 if i = u then // all the pointers have been treated C := C + 1 u := u + vmax v := 1 i := 0 vmax := v else v := 1 end if end if end while if v != 1 then C := C+1 end if  Notes and references  = Bibliography = * Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv, ¬´ On the Complexity of Finite Sequences ¬ª, IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, January 1976, p. 75‚Äì81, vol. 22, n¬∞1 = Application = * ¬´ Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive? ¬ª, By Colin Morris, is a blog post explaining how to use the Lempel-Ziv complexity to measure repetitiveness of song lyrics (with source code available).

It connects the two biggest and most populous islands of Streymoy to the west and Eysturoy to the east. Crossing the Sundini sound at its narrowest point, it is jokingly referred to as the 'Bridge over the Atlantic', being the only inter-island bridge in the Faroe Islands and one of the few such bridges in the Atlantic Ocean. Location The bridge is situated between the hamlet of Nesv√≠k on Streymoy and in between Nor√∞sk√°li and Oyrarbakki on Eysturoy, in the centre of the country. The bridge is part of national road number 10, running from T√≥rshavn to Klaksv√≠k, and is considered a core road. At both sides of the Sundini sound there are road junctions with roads to Ei√∞i, Tj√∏rnuv√≠k, Oyri and villages in between. Several stores and the region's primary school have clustered around the highway junction. Oyrarbakki is a main interchange in the country's public transport network. Apart from the interregional role, the bridge is an important link within Sunda municipality, which stretches both sides of the Sundini sound. The bridge has two car lanes and a narrow shared bicycle-foot path. History Construction started in 1970 and the opening was 30 October 1973. During the first three years after opening, the bridge only linked Streymoy to Eysturoy's western half. It was not until 1976, when the Nor√∞sk√°latunnilin opened, that the bridge gained a genuinely inter- regional character, as this tunnel linked the western Eysturoy to eastern Eysturoy's road network. Previous to 1973, traffic heading from the capital to Nor√∞sk√°li or Ei√∞i had to take a car ferry from H√≥sv√≠k to Oyrarbakki. Until 1976, traffic from T√≥rshavn to the Sk√°lafj√∏r√∞ur and Leirv√≠k had to take either the car crossing from H√≥sv√≠k to Selatra√∞ or a direct, slower ferry. In concert with construction, the Sundini sound was dredged and deepened to (at mean water level) in order to allow ships with a deeper draft. The bridge's clearance is . Future In 2011, on average 4,497 vehicles crossed the bridge per day. This number will halve to around 2,070 by 2024 when the Eysturoyartunnilin will have opened and form a quicker alternative for traffic between the capital T√≥rshavn, the Sk√°lafj√∏r√∞ur and the Northern Isles. The loss of potential clientele has caused slight distress in the region. However, the current bridge continues to be part of the Core Road Network. Also for traffic between T√≥rshavn and Klaksv√≠k, the bridge may continue to attract users who want to avoid the tunnel toll. Implications for the bus servicing are not known, yet it is likely that the country's frequent and trunk route #400, from T√≥rshavn to Klaksv√≠k, will be rerouted through the Eysturoyartunnilin, following a shorter and altogether more populous course.

Recruitment  *Company A: Franklin County *Company B: Franklin County *Company C: Franklin County *Company D: Perry County *Company E: Adams County *Company F: Lancaster County *Company G: Chester County *Company H: Centre County *Company I: Dauphin County *Company K: York County  History  In the wake of the Battle of Fort Sumter and President Abraham Lincoln's subsequent call for 75,000 volunteers in the spring of 1861, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began organizing regiments for ninety days' service in the Union Army. As companies of volunteers and militiamen began arriving in the state capital at Harrisburg, the men were gathered north of the city at Camp Curtin. On April 20, 1861, ten companies of volunteers were organized into a regiment and dubbed the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry. Most of the recruits came from central and south-central Pennsylvania. The next day they were sent to Washington but their train was halted near Cockeysville, Maryland because Secessionists had burned a railroad bridge as part of the Baltimore Riot. The regiment bivouacked in a field near the train for two days, worrying about further violence by the Secessionists. After the threat passed the regiment was sent to York, Pennsylvania arriving on April 24. They spent the next month drilling and training. On June 1, the 2nd Pennsylvania was sent to Chambersburg where it was placed in General George Wynkoop's second brigade of General William Keim's division in the Department of Pennsylvania commanded by General Robert Patterson. Within a few days a force of over 8,000 men was gathered around Chambersburg, mostly Pennsylvania and New York three-month regiments. Patterson's army was tasked with advancing into the Shenandoah Valley, engaging with General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate army stationed there, and preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard's army defending Manassas Junction, Virginia. On June 16 the 2nd Pennsylvania advanced from Chambersburg to Hagerstown, Maryland and then to Funkstown, where they remained until late June. Patterson's army crossed the Potomac River on July 2 at Falling Waters and advanced toward Martinsburg, Virginia. Just north of Martinsburg they encountered a brigade of Virginians commanded by Brigadier General Thomas J. Jackson. What resulted was a skirmish known as the Battle of Hoke's Run. The 2nd Pennsylvania did not take part in the skirmish, but were in close supporting distance and arrived on the battlefield shortly after Jackson retreated. From July 3 to July 15 the 2nd Pennsylvania took part in the occupation of Martinsburg. Then they joined with the rest of the army on an advance on Bunker Hill. General Patterson had, by this time, lost his nerve and was worried that he faced a much larger Confederate force. He pulled his army back to Charlestown where they entrenched and waiting for, what Patterson believed, the impending Confederate attack. Patterson had been entirely fooled by Johnston, who transferred the bulk of his army from the Shenandoah Valley to Manassas Junction where they played a decisive part in the Confederate victory at the Battle of Bull Run. General Patterson retreated to Harpers Ferry, Virginia and the next day was relieved of command. The end of their three-months service having expired, the 2nd Pennsylvania was sent back to Harrisburg by train and mustered out of service on July 26, 1861. Casualties Two men died of disease.

He was raised by his mother in Fayetteville, NC, while his father lived in Trenton, NJ. While his father was a member of the Nation of Islam and later a member in the community of Imam Warith Deen Mohammed (son of Elijah Muhammad), who merged into mainstream Islam. Malik was not exposed to Islam until the age of 16. Malik at a young age moved to Fayetteville, NC, but lived in numerous states including, New Jersey, and New York. He attended and graduated from Terry Sanford Senior High School in Fayetteville, NC. At 10 years old, while living in Plainfield, NJ, he knew his calling was in Hip Hop and set out on a path to be an emcee. At a young age he would be found break dancing, and rhyming in middle school with childhood friend and rapper, Skillz (Mad Skillz). He started recording music in the mid-1980s with a childhood friend who was his DJ. After rocking many house parties, and working on his lyrical skills, he was offered to travel as a performer with a friend's father who DJ'ed parties throughout North Carolina. This was Malik's first paying gig a mere $50.00 a week. After visiting Trenton, NJ over the summer, and with the heavy influences of the Five Percent Nation, Malik soon began spending his summers between Trenton, and Brooklyn, NY. Around the same time Malik met Wise, Human Beat Box and rapper of Hip Hop band Stetsasonic at a show in Fayetteville, NC.

The move officially set in motion the process for amending the 30-year-old charter and set up a federal system of government in the Philippines aimed at ending the Moro conflict and further opening up of the Philippine economy. Background Rodrigo Duterte campaigned for decentralization and a shift to federal government during the 2016 Philippine presidential election. In an October 2014 forum organized by Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City prior to joining the presidential race, the then mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for Moro people as a solution to the problems besetting Mindanao. Mayor Duterte said that Nur Misuari and his Moro National Liberation Front don't see eye-to- eye with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which the administration of President Benigno Aquino III had inked a peace deal with. He also said that the \\"template of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is federal,\\" but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country. In a dialogue with the Makati Business Club prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to \\"toning down the Constitution\\" in order to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines. He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will \\"leave it to Congress to decide.\\" The current constitution only allows 40 percent ownership for foreigners. In his first State of the Nation Address after winning the elections, Duterte vowed that he would be stepping down from power even before his term ends in 2022 if Congress can set up the federal system in the next few years. He urged both houses of Congress to look into the federal semi‚Äìpresidential form of government and said that \\"If you hurry up the federal system of government, you can submit to the Filipino people [in the] fourth, fifth year‚Ä¶ You call for a referendum. And after that, call for a presidential elections.\\" By the time Duterte signed Executive Order No. 10 on December 7, 2016, several legislators have filed bills to amend the Constitution, including Senators Franklin Drilon and Juan Miguel Zubiri who called for a constitutional convention, and Senators Ralph Recto and Richard J. Gordon who asked Congress to amend the restrictive economic provisions in the Constitution. In the House of Representatives, Deputy Speaker Gwendolyn Garcia filed a resolution calling both the House and the Senate to convene as a constitutional assembly which passed the House Committee on Constitutional Amendments on October 19, 2016. Provisions Executive Order No. 10 provides for the creation of a panel of not more than 25 members to \\"study, conduct consultations, and review the provisions of the 1987 Constitution including, but not limited to, the provisions on the structure and powers of the government, local governance, and economic policies.\\" The consultative committee shall represent the different regions and sectors of the country and shall be headed by a Chairperson who will preside over its deliberations. The order also provides for the inclusion of the Executive Secretary in the committee who shall act as an observer during its deliberations. It also states that all committee members shall be appointed or designated by the president. The order lists down the qualifications of the committee members such as being a Filipino natural-born citizen, resident and voter, at least 25 years of age, and of \\"recognized probity, independence, nationalism, patriotism, and expertise in his field.\\" It provides each member of the committee with not more than 2 technical and support staff with the Presidential Management Staff serving as its secretariat. The order also sets out the internal rules and procedures and the filling of vacancies in the committee, and orders the Department of Budget and Management to determine and provide its funding requirements and member's compensation. It also endeavors the consultative committee to complete its work and present its recommendations and proposals to the president, who will then submit them to Congress, in 6 months after it has convened. Consultative committee On April 10, 2017, just before leaving for a series of state visits to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, President Duterte said he will name the 25 members of the ConCom after the draft of a new Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) is submitted and if there is substantial progress in the peace process with the National Democratic Front (NDF). The BBL was drafted by the 21-member Bangsamoro Transition Commission, composed of 11 nominees from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and 10 from the Philippine government. Duterte also said that he is waiting for substantial progress in the peace talks with the NDF, particularly on the Comprehensive Agreement on Political and Constitutional Reforms, before announcing the composition of the ConCom. =Members of the Consultative Committee= *Reynato Puno (Chairperson) *Aquilino Pimentel Jr. *Randolph Climaco Parcasio *Antonio Arellano *Susan Ubalde-Ordinario *Arthur Aguilar *Reuben Canoy *Roan Libarios *Laurence Wacnang *Ali Pangalian Balindong *Edmund Soriano Tayao *Eddie Mapag Alih *Bienvenido Reyes *Julio Cabral Teehankee *Antonio Nachura *Rodolfo Dia Robles *Virgilio Bautista *Ranhilio Aquino *Victor de la Serna *Jose Martin Azcarraga Loon *Rex Cambronero Robles See also * Constitutional reform in the Philippines * Federalism in the Philippines * List of executive orders by Rodrigo Duterte References Category:Executive order (Philippines) Category:2016 in the Philippines Category:Legal history of the Philippines Category:Reform in the Philippines Category:Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte ","title":"Philippine Executive Order 10"},{"id":"54062101","text":"D√≤mhnall Iain MacLe√≤id (born 1943) is a writer, editor, and journalist in Scottish Gaelic.

The idea of Africa's negative stereotypes come from historical and media interactions. Many of the stereotypes of Africa originate from colonialism and media representation. Stereotypes by region =Asia= China views itself as a benevolent helper of Africans.. In Chinese internet culture, unlucky or incompetent video game players are called 'Africans', a reference to the expression 'black face' to mean unluckiness. Japan views Africa as a continent in need of help. Some Africans in India are perceived negatively. South Koreans view Africa as an undeveloped continent. =Europe= Belgians viewed Africans as childlike as in Tintin in the Congo. The French tried to civilize the continent by colonizing it. The Germans viewed themselves as the \\"master race\\" in comparison with Africans. Some Italians view Africans as illegal immigrants and beggars, which they in their experience often are, when they come to Italy. Polish understanding of Africa is informed by media, which tends to focus on negative or dramatic news from the continent. Portuguese viewed ruling Africa as an act of charity. Charles Darwin helped promote the idea that some groups, such as Africans and Australian Aboriginals, were closer to non-human apes than Europeans were. =United States= In the United States, Africa is viewed as disease-ridden and backward. =Oceania= Australians view Africans as part of criminal gangs. New Zealanders view Africans as illiterated. Common stereotypes =Environment= The common perception is that much or all of Africa is inhospitable jungle or desert, or that it is mostly uninhabited savanna populated mainly by wild animals. Another mistaken belief about Africa is that wild animals are commonplace and are perceived the way domestic animals are in Western countries. While many large wild animals are in Africa, and they are well known at safaris (especially the lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and buffalo), many citizens of African countries typically do not see them outside of zoos. = Poverty = Africa is often believed to be the epicenter of primitive culture and of poverty. Some countries in Africa are impoverished, but many countries in Africa have thriving and prosperous economies, including South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, and many others. = Technology = Throughout the developed world, Africans are often perceived to have \\"no access to modern technology\\"; however, this is inaccurate. A report in 2013 showed that 80 percent of Africans could access a mobile phone.TA Telecom White Paper: Africa Telecom Market 2013 Report Internet usage across Africa grew by 20% in 2018, with penetration rates across North Africa of 59%, West Africa of 39%,Southern Africa of 51% and East Africa of 45%. Many people falsely believe that Africans live in \\"mud house[s] in the middle of nowhere.\\" Urban areas in Africa account for 43% of the continent's population, though this is below the global average of 55 percent. Another common stereotype is that Africans commit online fraud. The most well-known African scam is the advance-fee scam. =Unity= Africa is often mistaken for a single country instead of a continent with 54 independent countries, each of which has its own languages, cultures, traditions, and histories. This misrepresentation leads people to think that all Africans are the same and are without a unique history and culture. Similarly, the Western world often believes that Africans speak a language named \\"African\\" (usually imagined to be similar in sound to Swahili) and that African is an official language. No one African language exists; over 2,000 distinct languages are spoken throughout the African continent. The most common language used on the African continent is Swahili.

It was also the name of the movement and group that was defined by this technique. Kino-Eye was Vertov's means of capturing what he believed to be \\"inaccessible to the human eye\\";Bulgakowa, Oksana. 2008. \\"The Ear against the Eye: Vertov's symphony.\\" Kieler Beitr√§ge zur Filmmusikforschung (2): 142-158. p. 142 that is, Kino-Eye films would not attempt to imitate how the human eye saw things. Rather, by assembling film fragments and editing them together in a form of montage, Kino-Eye hoped to activate a new type of perception by creating \\"a new filmic, i.e., media shaped, reality and a message or an illusion of a message - a semantic field.\\" Distinct from narrative entertainment cinema forms or otherwise \\"acted\\" films, Kino-Eye sought to capture \\"life unawares\\" and edit it together in such a way that it would form a new, previously unseen truth.  History  A shot from Enthusiasm (1931) In the early 1920s, cinema emerged as a central medium of artistic expression in the Soviet Union. The relatively new form was celebrated as the tool of a new social order by revolutionary leaders like Lenin and Trotsky.Taylor, Richard. 1979. The Politics of the Soviet Cinema 1917-1929. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 66 However, by the mid-1920s, as Richard Taylor writes, \\"The conventional structures of the cinema industry in its three major aspects - production, distribution, and exhibition - had been shattered by the Civil War.\\"Taylor, Richard. 1979. The Politics of the Soviet Cinema 1917-1929. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 64 Because of the resulting shortage of equipment and other resources, much of the footage shot in Russia in the 1920s was actually used for more \\"necessary\\" forms of film such as the newsreel. In fact, the vast majority of \\"entertainment\\" films shown in the 1920s were imported from Hollywood, and it was not until 1927 that Soviet-made films outsold imported films in the box office.Taylor, Richard. 1979. The Politics of the Soviet Cinema 1917-1929. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 65 Kino-Eye developed as a response to what was happening in much of Soviet cinema at the time Vertov entered the playing field. He wanted a revolutionary form, a form that could represent truth in the way he believed most \\"acted\\" films did not. Vertov credited American action films as the first form to harness cinema's incredible dynamism and the use of the close-up, but wanted to explore these forms even more deeply with Kino-Eye.Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 6 While the new technique of montage and its proponents like Kuleshov and Eisenstein had begun to change the landscape of Soviet film, Vertov's Kino-Eye found popularity in their universality. Jay Leyda writes: > \\"While most films produced at that time approached revolutionary subject- > matter with attitudes strongly influenced by the cheapest theatrical and > adventure-film traditions, both in selection and in method, Vertov's films > dared to treat the present and, through the present, the future, with an > approach as revolutionary as the material he treated.\\"Leyda, Jay. 1983. > Kino: A history of the Russian and Soviet Film. Princeton: Princeton > University Press. p. 179 In fact, Kino-Eye was based more fundamentally on the techniques of the newsreel than on montage or any entertainment-filmmaking process. Over a decade after the Civil War in 1939, Vertov wrote: > \\"Comrades, masters of Soviet cinema! ... One thing... seems strange and > incomprehensible to me. Why is the era of the Civil War missing from your > remembrances? It was then, after all, that a very large area of Soviet > cinema was born in joyful labor.

I tried to become a newsreel film writer.\\"Vertov, > Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette > Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California > Press. p. 145 In many ways, Kino-Eye resulted from newsreels and styles of Bolshevik journalism. Jeremy Hicks writes that the Bolsheviks had long espoused the newspaper as the main source of fact and truth. Vertov's cinematic form was a direct response to the truth that he found in journalism and its representations of everyday life.Hicks, Jeremy. 2014. Kino - The Russian Cinema: Dziga Vertov: Defining Documentary Film. New York: I.B. Tauris. p. 8 He hoped for Kino-Eye to capture cinematic truth  Technique  Vertov Like many of its contemporaneous art forms, Kino-Eye was an attempt to model objectivity amid the contradictions of Soviet modernity. The Kino-Eye was Vertov's solution to what he saw as the diluted nature of \\"propagandistic- artistic\\" Soviet film.Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 38 He thought of film as \\"dynamic geometry,\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien. Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 9 and therefore Kino-Eye would exploit dynamism in geometric space in a way that the eye could not. By manipulating the camera to exploit movement along with new editing techniques that focused on film speed and transitions, Kino-Eye would construct a new, objective depiction of reality. In 1923, Vertov wrote: > \\"I am kino-eye, I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, show you the world as > only I can see it. Now and forever, I free myself from human immobility, I > am in constant motion, I draw near, then away from objects, I crawl under, I > climb onto them...

Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. > Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: > University of California Press. p. 17-8 Kino-Eye was also a reaction to overly \\"acted\\" films that Vertov despised. It was positioned diametrically opposite what the kinoks thought of as \\"staged\\" film. They wanted to capture \\"real life,\\" which they believed could only be achieved through the objectivity of Kino-Eye. The kinoks held that actors could only ever produce \\"pseudorealism\\" through a scripted film. In a 1929 note on the \\"History of the Kinoks,\\" Vertov wrote: > \\"I don't know who's opposed to whom. It's difficult to stand up against the > cinema that is acted. It represents 98 percent of our world production. We > simply feel that the cinema's chief function is the recording of documents, > of facts, the recording of life, of historical processes.

We take a stand > against all that.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga > Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los > Angeles: University of California Press. p. 101 The goal of a non-staged, was the expansion of the cinematic field of vision, and thereby of the potential truth of that vision. It became largely recognized, as members of the film community could not help but recognize the success of works like Man with a Movie Camera. Author Osip Brik espoused Kino- Eye as a model for all Soviet film production.Leyda, Jay. 1983. Kino: A history of the Russian and Soviet Film. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 178 Vertov also hoped that Kino-Eye would make cinema more intelligible to the common people, so that it could truly become a mass media form. There has been much debate over whether Kino-Eye was intended as an epistemological form, an emancipatory form, or even a scientific form.Mayne, Judith. 1989. Kino and the Woman Question: Feminism and Soviet Silent Film. Columbus: Ohio State University Press. p. 154 Hicks writes about Kino-Eye as an early expression of documentary, as Vertov's films were not staged and captured \\"real life\\" in order to create \\"tremendous rhetorical force.\\"Hicks, Jeremy. 2014. Kino - The Russian Cinema: Dziga Vertov: Defining Documentary Film. New York: I.B. Tauris. p. 1 The delineation between \\"fiction\\" and \\"nonfiction\\" in film had not yet been clearly marked in the cinema as a new form of meaning- making. Crucially for Vertov, Kino-Eye allowed the meaning to be in the hands of the viewer, not the script. = Kinochestvo = Kinochestvo was the main cinematographic mechanism of Kino-Eye. In his writings, Vertov chastised contemporary cinematography as being too concerned with elements outside of the film shot itself, such as music or literature.Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino- Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 7 Contrary to traditional film-making techniques, Kino-Eye, through Kinochestvo, was interested in the \\"non-theatrical\\" film, that is, in films without script or composite characters, that would simply capture life \\"unawares,\\" or as it really was.Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 36 Kinochestvo would capture the non-acted film in order to produce a \\"truthful\\" depiction of life for cinema.  Kinoks  A shot from Three Songs of Lenin (1934) Vertov and his followers that took up Kino-Eye as their method of film production referred to themselves as kinoks (\\"cinema-eye men\\") rather than \\"cinematographers.\\" The kinoks wanted to \\"replace verbal debate, as a literary phenomenon, with film debate, that is, with the making of film-objects.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 32 Explode the barrier between the artistic film and the newsreel. The kinoks organized themselves in the same way the Soviets did - headed by the \\"Council of Three\\" (Vertov and two others), the rest were thought of as comrades in film-making. They celebrated their difference from traditional film-makers. Addressing his contemporary cinematographers, Vertov wrote, \\"However insignificant our practical achievement, nevertheless it's more than your years of nothing.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 37 The kinoks believed that through their method of Kino-Eye they were \\"keeping stride with the worldwide proletarian revolution.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino- Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 49 Their mission was to reveal the mysteries of life to the masses through their films. Their form was deeply tied to Soviet socialism, as they wanted to make cinema available to a working class audience. Still, the kinoks were not met with universal welcome. Eisenstein chastised them as wanting \\"to remove cinema from the ranks of the arts at all costs.\\"Eisenstein, S.M. 1988. Selected Works: Volume 1: Writings, 1922-34. Edited and translated by Richard Taylor. London: BFI. p. 39 Because of their highly experimental nature, the kinoks' films rarely became hits. Several films did gain national and even international recognition, such as Vertov's Three Songs of Lenin and Enthusiasm.  Man with a Movie Camera  An image from Man with a Movie Camera (1929) Largely considered Vertov's lone masterpiece, Man with a Movie Camera is the greatest example of Kino-Eye. According to Vertov, it required more work than his previous Kino-Eye films because of its complexity in both filming and editing.Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 82-3 Without words or titles, it relies solely on the visual language of film to tell its story, departing wholly from the languages of theatre and literature that the kinoks believed had infiltrated cinema. Vertov thought of the film as the culmination of his previous Kino-Eye features, writing: > \\"The film Man with a Movie Camera represents AN EXPERIMENT IN THE CINEMATIC > TRANSMISSION of visual phenomena WITHOUT THE HELP OF INTERTITLES (a film > without intertitles) WITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCRIPT (a film without a script) > WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE THEATRE (a film without actors, without sets, etc.). > This new experimental work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of > an authentically international absolute language of cinema - ABSOLUTE > KINOGRAPHY - on the basis of its complete separation from the language of > theatre and literature.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 2004. Lines of Resistance: Dziga > Vertov and the Twenties. Edited by Yuri Tsivian, translated by Julian > Graffy. Pordenone: La Giornate del Cinema Muto. p. 318-9 Unashamedly avant-garde, Man with a Movie Camera captures every day actions such as getting out of bed, washing, and even giving birth. It is in the editing and cutting together of these fragments that meaning is made. Hicks writes, \\"In its very form Man with a Movie Camera is a defence of documentary. For Vertov, however, the defense of documentary was inextricable from the defence of the integrity of cinema itself, since documentary was its purest, least theatrical form.\\"Hicks, Jeremy. 2014. Kino - The Russian Cinema: Dziga Vertov: Defining Documentary Film. New York: I.B. Tauris. p. 63 To Vertov, the film was his fullest physical manifestation of the theory of Kino-Eye. Responding to critics and those trying to intellectualize the film, he wrote, \\"In fact, the film is only the sum of the facts recorded on film.\\"Vertov, Dziga. 1984. Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov. Edited by Annette Michelson, translated by Kevin O'Brien.Los Angeles: University of California Press. p. 84 This simplicity and goal of objectivity is the foundation of Kino-Eye.

Poor Law administrator Neave acted as the first Assistant Poor Law Commissioner, in the Chester area, from January 1836.

Another recommendation was from Sir Charles Trevelyan, a cousin, who let it be known that the appointment would please him.Jenifer Hart, Sir Charles Trevelyan at the Treasury, The English Historical Review Vol. 75, No. 294 (Jan., 1960), pp. 92‚Äì110, at p. 98.

Another meeting to deal with Nottinghamshire Poor Law union issues, in the context of local politics and personalities, was with Robert Lowe at Bingham. Edwin Chadwick sought material with which to advocate against the Cheshire Constabulary, set up in 1829, and Neave supplied it. The 1837 general election caused local resistance in Cheshire to poor law reform, which Neave characterised as \\"backsliding\\".

The club were promoted to the top division of Scottish football for the first time in 1926, though they spent the majority of their first forty years in the second tier. The club's greatest period came during the 1960s under the guidance of two managers, Jock Stein (1960‚Äì1964) and George Farm (1967‚Äì1970).

A dispute over club membership caused some members to split away from Dunfermline Cricket Club, which resulted in the creation of Dunfermline Athletic Football Club on 2 June 1885. The club became the principle football club in Dunfermline and their first twenty-five years saw them compete primarily as an amateur team until they turned professional in 1899. Twentieth century =(1900‚Äì1959)= Having competed in minor local and national cups, Dunfermline first entered into the Scottish Football League in 1912 where they took part in the Scottish Division Two. The following years up until World War II saw the club achieve little success, with the side most frequently playing in the second tier, with occasional appearances in the top flight. Bobby Ancell was offered the manager's post in 1950 but with the Pars making headlines for board room disputes, he declined the offer. With a new board in place two seasons later, Ancell was offered the position again and this time accepted. Improving year on year Ancell delivered promotion back to the top flight in 1955 before leaving to start a decade at Motherwell. =The golden age (1960‚Äì1969)= Jock Stein, Dunfermline manager from 1960‚Äì1964 Jock Stein became manager in 1960 and so began the club's golden decade. The club played regular European football in the UEFA and European Cup Winners Cups throughout the 60s (and also early 70s). Under Stein Dunfermline won the Scottish Cup in the 1960‚Äì61 season. They beat Celtic 2‚Äì0 in the final after a replay. In 1962 they reached the Cup-Winners Cup quarter finals, losing 5‚Äì3 on aggregate to √öjpest D√≥zsa SC. On the way they beat St Patrick's Athletic and FK Vardar. In the 1962‚Äì63 season Dunfermline beat Everton in the Fairs Cup and then played Valencia, losing 4‚Äì0 away before winning 6‚Äì2 at home. The Pars lost the subsequent play- off. Stein left in 1964 to join Hibernian. New manager Willie Cunningham took the club to the Scottish Cup final in the 1964‚Äì65 season. They lost the final 3‚Äì2 to a Celtic team that was at the beginning of new manager Jock Stein's era. The Pars finished 3rd in the league, one point behind top two Kilmarnock and Hearts. The following year Cunningham took Dunfermline to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup quarter-finals. Alex Ferguson was a player in the Dunfermline squad between 1964 and 1967. George Farm was manager from 1967 until 1970. He matched Stein by winning the Scottish Cup in 1968 with a 3‚Äì1 win in the final against Hearts. Farm then surpassed Stein and took the club to their greatest achievement to date, the semi-final of the European Cup Winners Cup in season 1968‚Äì69, losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to eventual winners Slovan Bratislava (Slovan beat FC Barcelona in the final). On the way to the semi-final Dunfermline beat APOEL, Olympiacos and West Bromwich Albion.George Farm career profile =Lower leagues (1970‚Äì1993)= Dunfermline, managed by Pat Stanton started the 1980s in poor form. The core of the team were Pars stalwarts, Dr Hugh Whyte in goal, John Salton, Kenny Thomson and Dr Bobby Robertson in defence and Sandy McNaughton up front. Of this quintet only Salton was not an ever- present in the league campaign. The team developed a habit of losing streaks, 2 of five games and 2 of three games and this caused relegation nerves. They hovered in third bottom position for most of the last third of the season, only being saved by the ineptitude of the Stirling Albion side who failed to score in their last thirteen games and by Berwick Rangers who had held up the division for most of the season. The Athletic made some headway in the 1981‚Äì82 season to mid table. Their home form let them down, only achieving three victories against St Johnstone, Queen's Park and East Stirlingshire whereas they won eight games on their travels. They were still over-reliant on 13 goal top-scorer Sandy McNaughton (in his last season at East End Park) but Grant Jenkins chipped in with 7. Team new boy, Norrie McCathie, signed in a swap deal from Cowdenbeath, scored 4 in his 19 appearances on his way to clocking up a club record of 497 league appearances before his death in 1996. Kenny Thomson and Bonar Mercer, both long servants, were freed at the end of the season. The team physio, Jimmy Stevenson retired after more than a quarter of a century of service. In the 1982‚Äì83 season the team were poor throughout and in the drop zone almost constantly, especially after the New Year's Day hammering by Raith Rovers. A change of manager was inevitable and manager Stanton left to go to Hibernian. New manager, Tom Forsyth tried 29 players during the league campaign but never found a settled formation. McNaughton was gone and the lack of goals proved fatal, relegation to the lower Division was inevitable. The only bright spot in the whole season was the 2‚Äì1 home victory in February over Hearts. Off the pitch, the death of long-time director Andrew Watson was another low point. A fresh season beckoned with a poor start with only three wins by the end of October caused yet another change of manager with the resignation of Tom Forsyth. The reserve team coach with no managerial experience was chosen from a long line of candidates. Jim Leishman had a strong Dunfermline pedigree, as a boy he had watched the 1960s Pars legends in European games and had progressed through the youth ranks to first team football before his playing career was ended by a bad leg break. The team initially continued to struggle under Leishman but he signed from Hong Kong Rangers John Watson for ¬£300 in what proved to be a good move for the club. An otherwise uneventful 1983‚Äì84 season ended with a brief flourish and a final 9th position in Division 2. Hugh Whyte was the only ever-present and Stephen Morrison was the top league scorer with a meagre 9 goals. The 1984‚Äì85 season opened in dramatic fashion. Six straight wins took the Pars to the top of the league with John Watson, Grant Jenkins and Norrie McCathie scoring well. The defence had been strengthened with the arrival of Dave Young at centre half. Good form lasted until October when the team hit a sticky patch which lasted until February. They managed one solitary victory over local rivals Cowdenbeath in November during this period and surrendered top spot to Alloa. The end of the league competition was closely fought but Montrose snatched the championship, with Alloa runners-up and Dunfermline third. Hugh Whyte, after long service since 1976, played his final league game of the season with a clean sheet against Stenhousemuir in March. Ian Westwater took over the goalkeeping mantle. The team scored 61 goals over the course of the season, John Watson leading the way with 15 but Grant Jenkins with 9, Norrie McCathie and Stevie Morrison with 8 each showed a great improvement on previous years. To mark the Centenary a special game was arranged with Aberdeen as the visitors. Ian Heddle scored to seal a 1‚Äì0 victory. Chart of yearly table positions of Dunfermline in the Scottish League.The 1985‚Äì86 season league campaign opened with no major close season signings. An early defeat in the third week of the season when the Pars lost 3‚Äì1 at Hampden to Queen's Park was followed with a long unbeaten run from September until mid-January. The attack were scored well, putting six past Albion Rovers and four past St Johnstone, East Stirlingshire and Berwick Rangers (twice). Six other games ended with the opposition picking the ball out of the net three times. The fixture list was badly disrupted during the three winter months with Dunfermline only managing to play six games. Three victories were not enough and the Pars surrendered the number one position to Queen of the South. The Pars maintained second place during eight league matches in March and April. Dunfermline suffered consecutive away defeats in early April to Queen of the South and Meadowbank Thistle. This was followed with three 4‚Äì0 home wins against Albion Rovers, St Johnstone and East Stirlingshire, a 2‚Äì0 win at East End Park over Arbroath and then a 4‚Äì0 victory at Shielfield Park, Berwick that had taken the Pars back to the top of the league. The last two fixtures were both away, the attack failed to score at Stenhousemuir in a 0‚Äì0 draw and the final game was at Stirling Albion. The Pars scored first but ended up losing 3‚Äì2. Fortunately for Dunfermline, nearest rivals Queen of the South also suffered in the final run- in, drawing two and losing two games. This meant that Dunfermline were promoted along with Queen of the South from the Scottish league's third tier to the second tier. No player was ever-present, Ian Westwater and Dave Young missing only one game each and Norrie McCathie only missing two games. On the scoring front, the Pars netted 91 times in the league. John Watson was top with 24 goals and Ian Campbell was next with 15 and Grant Jenkins with 14 goals. 1986‚Äì87 commenced with the visit of Forfar, the Pars squeezed a 1‚Äì0 win with a goal from John Watson and were up and running. Three more wins followed and the newly promoted men were top of the league. Their next visitors were East Fife who were yet to win in their start to the season. The form book was cturned on its head with East Fife racing into a 3‚Äì0 half-time lead. Dunfermline scored two in the second half but the visitors added another to triumph 4‚Äì2. David Moyes was substituted and this was to be the final appearance in his brief Dunfermline career. Ian Heddle was introduced to the line up in subsequent games and the Pars returned to form, won the next three games and drew the subsequent two. The second of which was against league leaders Airdrieonians. A crowd of more than 5000 watched a 0‚Äì0 draw. Hugh Whyte had to temporarily return between the posts for the next two games to cover for Ian Westwater, keeping a clean sheet in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Montrose but losing three in a draw in his final appearance at Forfar. The team were struggling to maintain consistency and their best form but kept in touch at the top of the league. Early leaders Airdrie were also losing form and were never to recover. Dunfermline had a poor November with wins over Kilmarnock and Montrose balanced by defeats at East Fife (again) and Airdrie and a home 2‚Äì2 draw with Queen of the South. Athletic managed to climb their way to the top of the league and were to stay there until the end of April. The season ended poorly with five defeats in the last eight games with Morton snatching the championship. Second place meant promotion again and the promise of matches against Scotland's top division teams in 1987‚Äì88. Norrie McCathie was the only ever-present. John Watson was the top scorer for the third year running with a more modest 13 goals. Ian McCall, in his first season, bagged eight and caught the eye of a number of clubs. In the 1987‚Äì88 season, Dunfermline knocked Rangers, who were managed by Graeme Souness, out of the Scottish Cup in the 4th round with a 2‚Äì0 home victory. Mark Smith and John Watson scored goals early in each half. John Brown was sent off for Rangers.The Norriw McCathie stand in 2013 Athletic opened the new league season with a 3‚Äì3 draw against Hibernian at East End Park. Central defender David Young scored two but didn't score again all season. Two away draws at Paisley and Falkirk followed before Celtic provided the first Old Firm visitors of the season. Craig Robertson opened the scoring, Andy Webster equalised from the spot for the Hoops before Eric Ferguson provided the winner giving Celtic one of only three defeats they suffered that season. Ian McCall was immediately sold for a club record ¬£200,000 transfer fee to Rangers. In the next match the Pars travelled to Dens Park and slumped to a 5‚Äì0 defeat, their heaviest loss of the whole season. From then on points were hard to come by. Highlights were hard to find, three wins over bottom club Morton and two over St Mirren. A narrow 1‚Äì0 win over Hibernian and a fighting 2‚Äì2 draw at Ibrox in December gave a brief respite before eight consecutive league defeats. The bad run ended with a 6‚Äì1 victory over Dundee at East End Park to avenge the heavy loss earlier in the season. Overall the Pars used from many team changes and never had a settled side including to using five goalkeepers; Ian Westwater managed 28 appearances but Tom Carson, Nicky Walker, David McKellar and Hans Segers took their turn between the posts. Nobody managed to be ever present, Craig Robertson, who had arrived in midfield at the start of the season, was nearest only missing two games. This helped him to top scorer position with 13 goals. Relegation back to the First Division followed during league re-construction meant that three teams were going down. Morton and Falkirk also faced the drop. David Young and Bobby Forrest left the club and Bobby Robertson retired having made a record 360 league appearances. Amongst the new faces, Ross Jack showed promise up front with four goals. =Bert Paton era (1993‚Äì1999)= The 1995‚Äì96 season featured a Scottish First Division championship title and automatic promotion to the Scottish Premier Division, after losing out to Aberdeen in a play-off the previous season. However it was also the season when the club's then-captain and all-time great player Norrie McCathie died suddenly at the age of 34 of carbon monoxide poisoning. The team went on to remain in the Scottish Premier League until 1999, when they were briefly relegated to the Scottish First Division for one season. East End Park, which had been the Pars home ground since their beginning in 1885, was redeveloped and converted to an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 12,509, with the West stand being renamed the Norrie McCathie stand of their late captain. Twenty-first century =Scottish Premier League (2000‚Äì2007)= Dunfermline's seven-year stay in the Scottish Premier League delivered mixed results. The 2002‚Äì03 season saw them finish 5th, their highest position yet with Stephen Crawford scoring 19 goals. The following season, Dunfermline did even better finishing in fourth place as well as reaching the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, which also saw them qualify for the UEFA Cup. Stephen Kenny, Dunfermline manager from 2006‚Äì2007 It was at this point of relative success for the provincial club that saw manager, Jimmy Calderwood and assistant Jimmy Nicholl leave the club to join rivals Aberdeen. This coincided with a downfall in the fortunes of the club. In 2004‚Äì2005 under the newly appointed David Hay the team ended up in the lower half of the SPL and Hay being sacked. Jim Leishman was promoted to the manager's job for a second spell and during the last 3 games of the season, guided the team to safety avoiding relegation. A year later brought another poor season during 2005‚Äì06 including an 8‚Äì1 home defeat to Celtic in February 2006, Dunfermline's worst defeat since the formation of the SPL in 1998. This was in a season when the Pars also reached the final of the League Cup, losing 3‚Äì0 to Celtic at Hampden Park. The 2006‚Äì07 season proved to be a bad start and Leishman returned to his job as Director of football with Stephen Kenny being appointed as the new manager in October 2006. However he could not turn round the fortunes of the club nor repeat Calderwood's success in the league as neither could the previous two managers. Dunfermline were relegated from the Scottish Premier League on 12 May 2007 after losing 2‚Äì1 against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Jim McIntyre had put the Pars one nil up after 37 minutes, but two late goals from Caley Thistle sealed Dunfermline's relegation to the First Division. Dunfermline lost their 3rd major final in four years (losing the 2007 Scottish Cup Final to Celtic 27 May). Since Celtic had already qualified for Europe by winning the SPL, Dunfermline were able to compete in the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Cup, thus managing the feat of being relegated and qualifying for Europe in the same season. =Return to the First Division (2007‚Äì2011)= After relegation to the First Division, Dunfermline lost two of their main players in goalkeeper Dorus de Vries who signed for Welsh side Swansea City and midfielder Gary Mason who opted to stay in the SPL with St Mirren. After losing the opening game of the season 2‚Äì1 to Hamilton Academical, the Pars played against a Manchester United XI in Scott Thomson's testimonial match, losing 4‚Äì0. Their first UEFA Cup match since defeat against FH Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur in 2004 came against Swedish Superettan team BK H√§cken at home where they drew one all. The return leg was played in Gothenburg two weeks later. Dunfermline lost the game 1‚Äì0, losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Dunfermline continued to play badly and it took four games for them to record their first win back down on Scotland's second tier. The team found themselves in 9th position after only 7 games, recording only one win. One positive aspect of the new season was the team managing to get to the final of the Challenge Cup beating Clyde, Airdrie and Ayr United on the way. On 25 November The Pars were defeated 3‚Äì2 by St Johnstone at Dens Park. The date of the final was changed from 4 November to the 25th because it would have required the postponement of First Division games involving the pair. Jim McIntyre, Dunfermline manager from 2007‚Äì2012 After one year in charge, Stephen Kenny's Dunfermline side languished near the bottom of the First Division Table. On 4 December 2007, Kenny was sacked as Dunfermline Athletic manager. Striker Jim McIntyre took charge as Caretaker manager of the club. Mcintyre's first match in charge was a home clash against Clyde on 8 December 2007. The Pars managed to scrape a one all draw. After going six games undefeated, McIntyre was appointed as Dunfermline manager on a full-time basis on 3 January 2008, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal. In late March 2008, local newspaper Dunfermline Press announced that Dunfermline Athletic were going into administration. The newspaper claimed they had a \\"credible\\" source but this source could not be substantiated. Dunfermline Athletic later made a statement saying that the claims made by the newspaper were false and that they were \\"disappointed\\" by the article. After languishing near the bottom of the table for the first half of the season, the Fife side managed to improve their results after Jim McIntyre was brought in, finishing 5th in the league after 36 games. The following season, despite a positive start, Dunfermline failed to challenge for promotion again ‚Äì ending the campaign fourteen points adrift of champions St Johnstone. However, a late rally did see them finish third on fifty-one points from their thirty-six games. Jim McIntyre's second full season in charge of Dunfermline started in much the same way as the previous season, with The Pars again gaining only nine points from the first eight matches. Similarly to the previous season, a late improvement saw the side collect seven wins in their final ten games, however this was not enough to ensure promotion for Dunfermline and saw them again finish in third position, this time fifteen points behind champions Inverness Caledonian Thistle. =SPL, relegation and financial difficulties (2011‚Äì2013)= The next season, Dunfermline found themselves top after six games. From then on, they never fell outside the top two, spending the majority of their time in second. Dunfermline's home and away form throughout the season saw them only lose once at home (1‚Äì3 against Morton) and gain the most points away from home in the division. After a decisive home win over closest rivals Raith Rovers by 2‚Äì1 the week before in front of a capacity crowd of over 11,000, Dunfermline clinched the 2010‚Äì2011 First Division championship and promotion to the Scottish Premier League following a 2‚Äì0 away win over Morton on 30 April 2011. The final match of the season was at home to Falkirk, where they won 3‚Äì0. After the game they were presented with the First Division Trophy in front of their fans. This meant that they ended the season with a twelve-game unbeaten run and six wins in a row, and 10 points ahead of second-placed Raith Rovers. In March 2012, with Dunfermline bottom of the SPL with 19 points, eight games without a victory and no wins at home all season, manager Jim McIntyre was sacked by the club and replaced with Jim Jefferies. Dunfermline's first home win of the season was a 3‚Äì0 victory against Aberdeen on 28 April 2012. However, on 7 May 2012, Dunfermline were relegated from the SPL after a 4‚Äì0 defeat against Hibernian. The Pars started brightly in the first few matches of the 2012‚Äì13 season, winning 6 of their first 7 matches however the club failed to pay the players' October wages on time and in November 2012, reports arose that there were unpaid tax bills due to HM Revenue and Customs. Chairman John Yorkston was adamant that any outstanding debt could be cleared, however further issues arose over the coming months as it was reported in December, January and February that players were paid late, and reduced wages, prompting the squad to lodge an official complaint with the SFL. In mid-February, the club announced it would launch their share issue, but it was cancelled at the last minute. With the club facing a winding up order over unpaid tax of ¬£134,000 on 26 March 2013, Dunfermline Athletic Football Club announced that the club would be put into voluntary administration, with accountancy firm PKF appointed administrators, and it was formally approved by the court the following day. Bryan Jackson, who was appointed to oversee the administration proceedings, announced on 28 March that eight players, including captain Jordan McMillan were to be made redundant, however manager Jefferies stayed, on the condition that his salary would be reduced. Assistant manager Gerry McCabe was also made redundant the following day. Players made redundant only had until 31 March to find new clubs, as this was the last day of player registrations for the 2012‚Äì13 season. The club's shareholder Gavin Masterton, who was responsible for placing the club in administration, apologised for his action. A week before the club went into administration, Pars Community, the club's largest supporters group, made a bid to buy the club, but the bid was unsuccessful and talks broke down. The club's debt is thought to be around 8.5 million pounds, with most of it owed to Masterton and other directors at the club. Due to being placed in administration, the Scottish Football Association placed sanctions on the club, restricting the club to signing only players under the age of 21, banning them from playing in the Scottish Cup and deducting 15 points. This points deduction resulted in the club being brought into the relegation struggle, and, on the final day of the season, after losing 1‚Äì2 to Airdrie United, the club ended the season in ninth place, the playoff position. They were subsequently relegated after losing the play-off final. =Scottish League One (2013‚Äì2016)= Jim Jefferies, Dunfermline manager from 2012‚Äì2014 Following their relegation from the Scottish First Division, the club were in Scottish League One (formerly known as the Scottish Second Division). The 2013‚Äì14 season started well, with the Pars winning three out of their first five games. Over the course of the season the club won a further sixteen games, drew six and finished the season in second place, forty-nine points behind league champions Rangers. The club participated in the Scottish Championship Play-offs where they successfully dispatched Stranraer 4‚Äì2 on aggregate in the semi-final. The play-off final was then set up against local rivals Cowdenbeath. The first leg at Central Park was an even encounter, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, meaning that the second leg at East End Park was an absolute decider. Unfortunately for the club, they were defeated 4‚Äì0 by Cowdenbeath, with the visitors scoring their first of the match in just twenty-seven seconds. This result ensured that the club would face another season in the Scottish League One. Allan Johnston, Dunfermline manager from 2015 to present The 2014‚Äì15 season started well, with the Pars topping the table after the first nine matches. However, by mid-December the club had dropped to fifth place, outside the play-off positions. On 16 December 2014 Jim Jefferies resigned as manager, with under 20's manager John Potter stepping into the role as first team manager. After a poor second half of the season, in which the club finished in seventh position, Dunfermline confirmed on 30 April 2015 that Potter would return to the position of head coach. On 8 May 2015, former Queen of the South and Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston was appointed as First Team manager of the Pars and tasked with improving on the side's league position for the coming 2015‚Äì16 season. Within a week of taking the position of manager, Johnston had released eighteen players ‚Äì including twelve first-team players ‚Äì in order to reduce the club's squad size and allow him to bring in \\"the right faces\\" to push for promotion back to the Scottish Championship. After making several high-profile signings including Jason Talbot and Callum Fordyce from Livingston, Ben Richards-Everton from Partick Thistle and Joe Cardle from Ross County, Dunfermline's start to the season consisted of some excellent scoring, with the club winning by 1‚Äì4, 5‚Äì1, 1‚Äì6 and 7‚Äì1 against Arbroath, Cowdenbeath, Brechin City and Cowdenbeath again respectively. After defeating Brechin City and promotion rivals Ayr United in December, the side remained at the top of the league for the remainder of the season, finishing 18 points ahead of Peterhead, their closest rivals. On 26 March 2016, it was confirmed that Dunfermline were champions of the league, after a 3‚Äì1 victory over Brechin City, with star-player Faissal El Bakhtaoui netting the first hat-trick of his career. This ended their 3-year exodus from the second tier of Scottish football after the club's administration and subsequent relegation in 2013. =Scottish Championship (2016‚Äì)= Following a pre-season which began just 5 weeks after the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Dunfermline began the 2016‚Äì17 season in July 2016 by placing third of five teams in Group C of the newly formatted Scottish League Cup. The clubs first outing in the Scottish Championship came at East End Park, with the team defeating Dumbarton 4‚Äì3 on 6 August 2016. Following this, the Pars then went on a poor run of form, taking just 4 points from the next 9 matches, leaving them in 8th position after the first round of fixtures. The sides on-field performances improved considerably between November and February, where they recorded just one defeat (against Dundee United) in all competitions, finding themselves 6th in the league, 6 points above the relegation play-off position and 13 points ahead of St Mirren in 10th.

El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, and is dominated by two mountain ranges running east‚Äìwest. Its climate is tropical, and the year is divided into wet and dry seasons. Before the conquest the country formed a part of the Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya. Native weaponry consisted of spears, bows and arrows, and wooden swords with inset stone blades; they wore padded cotton armour. The Spanish conquistadores were largely volunteers, receiving the spoils of victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The Spanish expeditions to Central America were launched from three different Spanish jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile Spanish captains. Spanish weaponry included swords, firearms, crossbows and light artillery. Metal armour was impractical in the hot, humid climate of Central America and the Spanish were quick to adopt the quilted cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by a large number of Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups. The first campaign against the native inhabitants was undertaken in 1524 by Pedro de Alvarado. Alvarado launched his expedition against the Pipil province of Cuscatlan, also known as Nequepio, from the Guatemalan Highlands, but by July 1524 he had retreated back to Guatemala.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 766. Gonzalo de Alvarado founded San Salvador the following year, but it was eradicated by a native attack in 1526, during a general uprising that spread across the region. Pedro de Alvarado returned to campaign in El Salvador in 1526 and 1528, and in the latter year, Diego de Alvarado reestablished San Salvador and issued encomiendas to his supporters. In 1528, the uprising finally ended when the Spanish stormed the native stronghold at the Pe√±ol de Cinacantan. In 1529, El Salvador became embroiled in a jurisdictional dispute with neighbouring Nicaragua. Pedrarias D√°vila sent Mart√≠n de Estete at the head of an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader of a rival Spanish expedition in eastern El Salvador, and marched on San Salvador, before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in El Salvador, and it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.P√©rez 2016, p. 5. El Salvador before the conquest Before the conquest, El Salvador formed a part of the Mesoamerican cultural region.Peterson 1997, p. 25. The central and western portions of the territory were inhabited by the Pipil, a Nahua people culturally related to the Aztecs of Mexico. The Pipil were divided into three main provinces in El Salvador; the two largest were Cuscatlan and Izalco, while Nonualco was the smallest of the three.White 2009, p. 27. Cuscatlan extended from the Paz River in the west to the Lempa River in the east.Boland 2001, pp. 12‚Äì13. Izalco lay to the southwest of Cuscatlan and was subservient to it on the eve of the Spanish conquest;Boland 2001, p. 13. its territory is now incorporated into the modern departments of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate.Fowler 1993, p. 182. The Nonualco area is in the region of La Paz centered around the city of Zacatecoluca. Other indigenous groups with territories in El Salvador were the Ch'orti' and the Poqomam (both of these were Maya peoples), the Lenca, the Xinca, the Kakawira, the Mangue, and the Matagalpa. The Postclassic Maya and Pipil cities were relatively small by Mesoamerican standards, especially when compared with the great Maya cities of the earlier Classic period (c. 250‚Äì950 AD).White 2009, p. 28. The Lenca occupied territory to the east of the Lempa River,Olson and Shadle 1991, p. 199. where their principal kingdom was Chaparrastique.Boland 2001, p. 13. Rivas 1993, 2000, p. 42. Chaparrastique extended across territory now incorporated into the departments of La Uni√≥n, Moraz√°n, and San Miguel. The Ch'orti' and Poqomam occupied territories in the west near the present day border of Guatemala. The extreme east of El Salvador was occupied by the Mangue, with the Matagalpa in the southeast. The population of the entire territory of El Salvador is variously estimated between 130,000 and 1,000,000 at the time of the conquest; the low-mid estimates within this range are more likely.Boland 2001, p. 13. Fowler 1988, pp. 113, 115. The three principal kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique engaged in regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours. There was flourishing trade, with cacao as the principal commodity, although maize, cotton, and balsam were also traded. =Native weaponry and tactics= The Pipil used wooden weapons with stone blades. Their weapons included long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades similar to the Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms.White 2009, p. 31. Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 89‚Äì90. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down to their feet and significantly encumbered them.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 89‚Äì90. After the first two large-scale battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 92. A common tactic of the natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly defended mountaintop fortresses.Gallardo 2014, pp. 74‚Äì75. Background to the conquest Map of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean during the 16th century Christopher Columbus discovered the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.Feldman 2000, p. xix. The Spanish founded Santo Domingo on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the 1490s.Nessler 2016, p. 4. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 272. In the first two decades of the 16th century, the Spanish established their domination over the islands of the Caribbean Sea, and used these as a staging point to launch their campaigns of conquest on the continental mainland of the Americas.Barahona 1991, p. 69. From Hispaniola, the Spanish launched expeditions and campaigns of conquest, reaching Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica in 1509, Cuba in 1511, and Florida in 1513.Deagan 1988, p. 199. The Spanish heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west of their Caribbean island settlements and, in 1519, Hern√°n Cort√©s set sail to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 276. The Spanish conquered a large part of Mexico within three years, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies.Coe and Koontz 2002, p. 229. The conquest of Central America that followed was effectively an extension of the campaign that overthrew the Aztec Empire.Barahona 1991, pp. 69‚Äì70. Conquistadors Pedro de Alvarado led the initial Spanish incursion into El Salvador. The conquistadors were all volunteers, the majority of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead a portion of the spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour.Polo Sifontes 1986, pp. 57‚Äì58. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe.Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 62. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and Extremadura. Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain.Gallardo 2013, p. 107. The conquest of the Central American isthmus was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, and envy.Stone 1990, p. 51. The conquistadors were accompanied by a great many indigenous allies. These included Tlaxcaltecs, Mexicas, Cholutecs, Xochimilcos, Texcocanos, and Huejotzincas that accompanied Pedro de Alvarado from central Mexico, Zapotecs and Mixtecs that joined him as he marched south towards Guatemala and El Salvador, and Kaqchikels that joined him in Guatemala. A key strategy was the establishment of colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; they were used to project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside.Gallardo 2013, pp. 105, 109. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion. =Spanish weapons and armour= The steel sword was the greatest Spanish advantage in terms of weaponry.Restall and Fern√°ndez Armesto 2012, location 1576. The conquistadors employed broadswords, rapiers, firearms (including the arquebus), crossbows and light artillery such as the falconet.Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26, 62. Gallardo 2014, p. 77. An important Spanish advantage was the use of war horses; their deployment often terrified the native inhabitants of the Americas, who had never seen horses until European contact. As important as the physical advantage given to a mounted conquistador was the ability to rapidly move bodies of troops across a battlefield to outmaneuver their opponents, who were exclusively on foot. Repeated mounted charges could have a devastating impact on massed native infantry.Wise and McBride 1980, 2008, pp. 9‚Äì10. The Spanish also employed fierce war dogs in battle.Johnson 2009, p. 76. Pohl and Robinson 2005, pp 95‚Äì96. Restall and Fern√°ndez Armesto 2012, location 1585. When laying siege to native fortresses, they would on occasion build wooden siege engines padded with cotton armour, which would act to shield attackers from enemy missiles, and allow them to climb over any fortifications. Mounted conquistadors were armed with a lance, that also served as a pike for infantrymen. A variety of halberds and bills were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a long two-handed version was also used.Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 26. Crossbows had arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley.Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26‚Äì27. Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in a humid tropical climate.Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 27. Metal armour was of limited use in the hot, wet tropical climate. It was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle.Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 23. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this with the use of a simple metal war hat.Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 16, 26. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand. Impact of Old World diseases Diseases introduced to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520‚Äì1521, and is also likely to have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador.Fowler 1993, p. 185. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545‚Äì1548, and again in 1576‚Äì1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels,White 2009, pp. 32‚Äì33. making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever.White 2009, p. 33. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.Coe 1999, p. 231. Spanish discovery of El Salvador Principal expedition routes of the Spanish conquest of El Salvador Gil Gonz√°lez D√°vila and Andr√©s Ni√±o first explored the coast of El Salvador in 1522 as they sailed northwest along the Pacific coast of Central America from Panama, and briefly landed in the Bay of Fonseca.White 2009, p. 32. Barahona 1991, p. 70. Newson 1986, 2007, p. 144. El Salvador fell in a frontier region between rival conquests launched southward from Mexico under the command of Hern√°n Cort√©s and his trusted lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado, and northward from Panama under the command of Pedrarias D√°vila.White 2009, p. 32. Conquest The territory now incorporated into El Salvador was not politically unified at the time of Spanish contact. As with neighbouring regions, this hindered the progress of incorporation into the Spanish Empire, as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn; this contrasted with Mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with the fall of its capital, Tenochtitlan. As Spanish authority gradually spread out from Mexico and Panama, this left El Salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond Spanish control. Spanish colonial towns were founded according to the whim of individual conquistadors, with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them, often leaving them isolated. In 1548, El Salvador was formally placed within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, which extended along the Central American isthmus from Chiapas, now in southern Mexico, to Costa Rica.Giusto and Iuliano 1989 p. 9. =First expeditions, 1524‚Äì1528= Pedro de Alvarado entered El Salvador from Guatemala in the rain season of 1524, leading an army of 250 Spaniards, 100 of which were mounted, and 5000 Guatemalan allies. The invaders overcame the natives in pitched battles and fought off guerrilla attacks on their forces. Alvarado crossed the R√≠o Paz from Guatemala on 6 June 1524,Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 88‚Äì89. Boland 2001, p. 14. and arrived at Mopicalco, in what is now the department of Ahuachap√°n, to find it abandoned.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 88‚Äì89. They continued to Acatepeque, where the inhabitants had also fled the approaching Spanish expedition. Battle of Acajutla, 1524 Acajutla is located on El Salvador's coastal plain. From Acatepeque, the Spanish expedition proceeded to Acajutla, on the Pacific coast. On 8 June 1524,Boland 2001, p. 14. they met with a massed native force, arrayed for battle half a league (approximately ) beyond the settlement. Alvarado's army initially approached close to the waiting warriors, before feigning a retreat towards a nearby hill. The native forces pursued for a quarter of a league, arriving within bow-shot of the invaders, at which point Alvarado ordered both cavalry and infantry to charge. In the battle that followed, the defending natives were killed to a man.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 89. Alvarado described how the natives were so encumbered by their thick cotton armour and their weapons, that when they fell they were unable to stand back up to defend themselves. Many Spaniards were wounded in the battle, and Alvarado was seriously injured by an arrow that passed through his leg, he needed much time to recover and was left with a permanent limp. The Spanish rested in Acajutla for five days after the battle, in order to rest and recover from their wounds.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 90. Battle of Tacuzcalco, 1524 Six days after the battle, Alvarado marched northeast searching for the city of Tacuzcalco,Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 90‚Äì91. some from Acajutla,Fowler 1993, p. 184. in the modern department of Sonsonate.Tous i Mata 1997, p. 205. Pedro de Portocarrero led a group of mounted scouts that managed to capture two native lookouts, from whom they learned that a large native army had gathered near the city, with forces gathered from the surrounding area. The Spanish scouts advanced until they found the enemy, then waited for the vanguard of forty cavalry led by Gonzalo de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado was travelling in the rearguard, slowed by his wounds. Alvarado watched the battle unfold from a nearby viewpoint, and left command in the hands of his brothers. He sent G√≥mez de Alvarado with twenty cavalry to attack the left flank, and Gonzalo de Alvarado with thirty cavalry against the right flank. He sent Jorge de Alvarado with the rest of his men against a mass of warriors that was still distant but they stood off for a time, believing that the two forces were separated by a swamp. As soon as the Spanish discovered that the apparent swamp was in fact solid ground, they charged the enemy and routed them, killing a great many.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 91. After this battle, the Pipil refused to confront the Spanish upon an open battlefield, and resorted to guerilla tactics. Retreat to Guatemala, 1524 Alvarado rested two days at Tazuzcalco, before proceeding to Miahuaclan, which had been abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of the province of the same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found that the majority of the inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused.Recinos 1952,1986, pp. 92‚Äì93. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.Recinos 1952,1986, p. 93. Although the Spanish had won decisive victories at Sonsonate and Acajutla, they failed to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco. Alvarado was informed that extensive lands lay ahead, with difficult terrain, many cities, and large populations. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Alvarado withdrew to Guatemala to regroup, with the intention of returning in the dry season; He had been in the province of Cuscatlan for seventeen days, and left it at the end of June 1524.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 97. Founding of San Salvador San Salvador (Ciudad Vieja) Gonzalo de Alvarado founded the settlement of Villa de San Salvador in early 1525, before May of that year,Matthew 2012, p. 84. but it was attacked and destroyed by natives in 1526, during a general Pipil uprising that engulfed the province of Cuscatlan.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, p. 206. Diego de Alvarado, who was Pedro de Alvarado's cousin, was sent to reconquer Cuscatlan in the same year;Amaroli 1991, p. 61. he was accompanied by 300 Indian auxiliaries from Soconusco, 160 of whom died in the campaign.Matthew 2012, pp. 84‚Äì85. He was joined by Pedro de Alvarado after the latter returned from an expedition to Chiapas. By 1526, the territory of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras was racked by indigenous wars against the Spanish invaders.Gallardo 2013, p. 109. Izalco did not join the general uprising, having been militarily exhausted by the battles of Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. The campaign that followed lasted two years, during which the Spanish battled continually against indigenous resistance.Amaroli 1991, pp. 61‚Äì62. During this time, the natives defended themselves from fortified mountain strongholds. Pedro de Alvarado undertook further expeditions to El Salvador in 1526 and 1528. In 1528, the conquest of Cuscatlan was completed,Amaroli 1991, p. 62. with the aid of a significant body of Nahua allies from central and southern Mexico.Matthew 2012, p. 87. On 1 April 1528,Gallardo 2013, p. 106. Diego de Alvarado reestablished San Salvador, and distributed encomienda rights among his supporters. This site is now known as Ciudad Vieja, and is situated south of Suchitoto. The location may have been chosen because it occupied a no- man's-land between the territory of the Pipil to the west, the Lenca to the east, and the Ch'orti' to the north.Gallardo 2013, pp. 109‚Äì110. For the first few years, San Salvador was a frontier town under the constant threat of indigenous attack. Soon after the town was re-founded, a Spaniard and some indigenous auxiliaries were killed when visiting a nearby settlement. Battle of Cinacantan, 1528 Map of the principal settlements and battles of the conquest of El Salvador The uprising around San Salvador was put down about a month later, when the Spanish stormed the mountaintop stronghold at Cinacantan,Gallardo 2013, p. 110. south of the modern town of Tamanique.Gallardo 2014 p. 62. The hostile natives had retreated to their stronghold after their earlier attack.Gallardo 2014, p. 76. The uprising was considered the first native rebellion in Cuscatlan, since the initial invasion had already taken place, and San Salvador founded as a Spanish town. A Spanish column was despatched from San Salvador, led by Diego de Alvarado and supported by indigenous auxiliaries.Gallardo 2014, p. 75. They found three or four allied native groups had set up a defensive position upon the strongly fortified Pe√±ol de Cinacantan (\\"Rock of Cinacantan\\", now known as Cerro Redondo); at least one of the groups was Pipil, and possibly all of them.Gallardo 2014, p. 77. The sides of the fortress were shear, except for a single approach that was strongly defended. As the Spanish party attempted to storm the fortress, the natives threw rocks down upon them, and showered them with arrows and spears. On the first day, Spanish assaults were twice beaten back. Seeing that the fortress could not easily be taken, the Spanish built a wooden siege engine, which greatly impressed the defenders.Gallardo 2014, pp. 76‚Äì77. One of the native lords called a truce and asked the Spanish to return to San Salvador, and promised that the rebellious Indians would arrive to swear loyalty to the King of Spain. The attackers believed this to be a trick, and launched a new attack using their newly built siege tower. They breached the fortifications and killed many of the defenders, while many others fled in terror. Once the fortress had fallen, the defeated Pipil defenders were given in encomienda to the inhabitants of San Salvador; the inhabitants were probably reduced to Tamanique.Gallardo 2014, pp. 79‚Äì80. =Inter-Spanish rivalry, 1529‚Äì1530= In 1529, Pedrarias D√°vila sent an expedition led by Mart√≠n de Estete to annex the territory of El Salvador to his domains in neighbouring Nicaragua, going so far as to distribute the unconquered natives of the Gulf of Fonseca in encomienda to his followers. At the time, Diego de Rojas was in command of the Spanish forces attempting to pacify indigenous resistance centred on Popocatepet. In January or February 1530, Mart√≠n de Estete captured Rojas, and marched on San Salvador, but was unable to gain the support of the residents there, and set up camp at Perulapan (modern San Mart√≠n Perulap√°n), just to the south, which he called Ciudad de los Caballeros (\\"City of the Knights\\"). The acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Ordu√±a, sent his captain Francisco L√≥pez at the head of an expedition to drive out the interlopers.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, pp. 204‚Äì206. L√≥pez left Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala in March 1530 with thirty cavalry, and an unspecified body of infantry. The residents of San Salvador rose up in arms to join the relief force; Estete abandoned his camp and retreated towards Nicaragua, taking with him 2000 enslaved Cuzcatlecos. L√≥pez pursued Estete and caught up with his forces after crossing the Lempa River. Estete and his second-in-command fled for Nicaragua, and his soldiers surrendered to L√≥pez. Diego de Rojas was freed, and the slaves recovered. This intervention put an end to Pedrarias D√°vila's hopes of securing El Salvador as part of Nicaragua.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, p. 207. =Eastern El Salvador, 1530‚Äì1538= In order to defend against further rival Spanish incursions from the southeast, Pedro de Alvarado established the Spanish town of San Miguel, which he also used as a base of operations for attacks against the Lenca. A Spanish force commanded by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, consisting of about 120 Spanish cavalry, accompanied by infantry and Indian auxiliaries, crossed the Lempa River and founded San Miguel on 21 November 1530.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, pp. 207, 380. In addition to the Spanish colonists, the settlement included Mexica and Tlaxcalan allies, among other Indian auxiliaries.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, p. 380. Most of the Spanish population of San Miguel abandoned El Salvador with Pedro de Alvarado when he set out on his expedition to Peru. Crist√≥bal de la Cueva, under orders from Jorge de Alvarado in Guatemala, had entered Honduras with about forty men to establish a new port and road to Guatemala, and to put down a native uprising there. He was challenged by Andr√©s de Cerezeda, governor of Honduras, and eventually marched south to San Miguel with his men,Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 33. bringing an urgently needed influx of new colonists.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 34. San Miguel was refounded as San Miguel de la Frontera by Crist√≥bal de la Cueva on 15 April 1535. De la Cueva brought the area back within the jurisdiction of Guatemala, although the governor of Honduras vigorously protested. Eastern El Salvador, centred on the town of San Miguel, became the Province of San Miguel,Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, pp. 161, 380. which included the territory of the pre-Columbian province of Chaparrastique. In early 1537, San Miguel was isolated by a general Lenca uprising that spread south from Honduras. A native army laid siege to San Miguel over the course of three days from 27 March. Their surprise attack caught many of the inhabitants defenceless, and 50‚Äì60 Spanish colonists were killed, more than half of the Spaniards then resident in the town. After three days the attackers were repulsed by reinforcements that were passing through from Guatemala en route to Peru, with the help of a detachment from San Salvador under the command of Antonio de Quintanilla.Vallejo Garc√≠a-Hevia 2008, p. 381. This uprising enveloped the territory of El Salvador, led by the Lenca ruler Lempira, and focused upon the Pe√±ol de Cerqu√≠n, about north of San Salvador, within Honduras. Francisco de Montejo, then governor of Honduras, urgently appealed to San Salvador for reinforcements and supplies.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 83. Montejo sent twenty Spaniards supported by native auxiliaries south towards the Valley of Xocorro, within the jurisdictional claim of San Miguel, but a scouting party was captured by the Spaniards resident there, and Montejo's column withdrew back to Honduras;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 84. en route to Comayagua they were attacked by a Lenca force, and killed almost to a man.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 84‚Äì85. The inhabitants of San Salvador, alarmed by the uprising engulfing the region, responded by sending a great quantity of weapons, armour, gunpowder, and other supplies to Montejo in Honduras. One hundred Indian auxiliaries were also sent, with one thousand native porters.Gallardo 2013, p. 110. Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 87. Further supplies were forthcoming from the embattled residents of San Miguel.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 87‚Äì88. By the end of 1538, Lempira's stronghold had been taken by the Spanish,Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 89‚Äì90. and Montejo crossed from Honduras to San Miguel to assist in putting down continued indigenous resistance in the district.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 95. Colonial organisation By 1539, the Spanish advances in El Salvador were sufficient that Cuscatlan was considered fully pacified.Dalton 1989, 1997, p. 26. In the immediate aftermath of the Spanish conquest, the conquistadors sought wealth through slaving and mining, but both of these industries soon faltered, and the colonists instead turned to agriculture. In 1545, San Salvador was moved to its current location, and on 27 September 1546, it was elevated in status to a city. El Salvador originally formed three administrative divisions, those of Sonsonate (Izalcos), San Salvador (Cuscatlan), and San Miguel. Sonsonate was an alcald√≠a mayor, while San Salvador, San Miguel, and Choluteca (now in Honduras) formed the alcald√≠a mayor of San Salvador. From 1524, all of these fell within the jurisdiction of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. In 1542, this jurisdiction was reorganised as the Real Audiencia de Guatemala, and later the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Ecclesiastically, all of El Salvador fell within the Roman Catholic diocese of Guatemala. The native inhabitants of the Izalco region of El Salvador, famed for its prodigious production of cacao, were among the most heavily exploited in the whole Spanish Empire.Fowler 1993, p. 181. By the end of the 16th century, this had led to the collapse of cacao production in the province.Fowler 1993, p. 197. Historical sources The Annals of the Cakchiquels, an indigenous document from the Guatemalan Highlands, contains an account of Pedro de Alvarado's initial incursion into El Salvador.Fowler 1985, p. 41. Pedro de Alvarado wrote four letters to Hern√°n Cort√©s describing his conquest of Guatemala and El Salvador, of which two survive. One of these relates his expedition into El Salvador, with an eye to military detail. It is of particular use in its description of tactics and weaponry, although it is disdainful of the native culture.Fowler 1985, pp. 42-43.

Native to central and northern Europe and Asia, it was first recorded in South America in the 1980s and New Zealand in 1997, and has also been introduced to Australia, South Africa and Lesotho. Its larvae feed on the leaves of various species of willow. Description An adult is between long. It is a slender insect with two pairs of membranous wings with black veins, the fore-wings having a yellow leading edge. The head bears a pair of long antennae, a pair of black compound eyes and three ocelli. The sides of the thorax are pale yellowish-brown while the dorsal surface is mid-brown. The abdomen is greenish and the legs are yellowish-brown at the base and darker brown near the clawed tips. The larva resembles a lepidopteran caterpillar; it has a white head with brown markings, a green body, three pairs of true legs near the front and seven pairs of pro-legs behind. Distribution The willow sawfly is widespread in the Holarctic region and has spread to other parts of the world. It was recorded in South America for the first time in the 1980s, in Argentina and Chile where it caused severe defoliation of various species of willow (Salix). In 2017 it was recorded in Colombia on the ornamental willow Salix humboldtiana. It had reached New Zealand by 1997 and was also present around this time in Australia. In both of these countries it spread rapidly, with the larvae feeding on species of willow, which are not native plants in Australia and New Zealand. It has also been found in South Africa and Lesotho. Life cycle Eggs are laid on the leaves of the host tree, and the developing larvae feed on the leaf tissue. Larvae have a variable number of instar stages and fall to the ground when fully developed. They make their way underground and overwinter as non-feeding prepupae in the cocoons they form. However, in Colombia it was found that larvae remain on the tree and form their cocoons there; these are green and easily overlooked among the foliage. The prepupae pupate in the spring, the adults emerging when new foliage is available. Adults each lay about thirty eggs soon after emerging. In South America, all adults are female and reproduction is by parthenogenesis. The same is true in other parts of the Southern Hemisphere where it has been introduced, but in its native range in the Northern Hemisphere, both males and females occur. Shifting from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction is fairly common in invasive species and offers several advantages. The small number of individuals initially introduced into a new habitat would make it difficult for sexual partners to find each other. Also, a population that is all female can potentially expand at twice the maximum rate of a population with two sexes, allowing an invasive species to establish itself more rapidly. Sexual reproduction with its usual advantage of genetic recombination is not as favored in invasive populations, which lack predators.

She grew up in a household with nine children, which gave her plenty of playmates. At age 13, she began playing in a city softball league. When she was 16, six other Regina ballplayers joined the All American League, including her elder sister Bonnie Baker. Like her sister, George was a catcher, a valuable commodity in the league. She then earned an opportunity in 1948 and was assigned to the Muskegon Lassies, where she played as a backup for incumbent Dorothy Maguire.Madden, W. C. (2000) All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book. McFarland & Company. The 20-year rookie was sparingly used, as she only caught 14 games during the season. George then was not offered a contract to return the next season. She posted a batting average of .154 (2-for-13) with a run scored and two runs batted in. On the field, she handled 19 putouts with two assists without committing an error. Afterwards, she came to Regina and started to play at third base for the city team. In 1951, she married to Canadian Football League tackle Jim McFaul. The couple fostered two sons, Jim and George, and had five grandchildren. In between, she played with Regina through 1959, winning the World Championship with the team in 1954. She widowed in 1994.

Sanhujori include consuming healthy foods, doing exercise and warming up the body. The sanhujoriperiod typically lasts approximately from one week to one month. Sanhujori is a compound word: 'sanhu' ; after the birth) and 'jori' (; the regaining of the physical condition before the next pregnancy by doing a variety of recovery activities). In a pre-modern society, sanhujori services were provided by the family members of mothers. However, the traditional extended family system has been broken up and the services began to be offered by private postpartum centers (sanhujoriwon) and postpartum care workers (sanhujorisa). People often believe that sanhujori has a great impact on women's life-long health conditions; mothers who do not properly performed sanhujori practices may suffer from a range of illnesses, such as joint inflammation, urinary incontinence, low blood pressure, and depression.  History  In Korean history, sanhujori services were usually provided by the mother's family members and in-law families. These family members performed a range of tasks, such as cooking foods for them and taking care of their newborns, thereby liberating the mothers from the heavy housework load. Through this process, mothers had an opportunity to recover their health and learn knowledge and skills, which are necessary for child caring in the future. On the other hand, some sanhujori practices were superstitious rather than practical; family members sometimes blocked mothers from participating in funeral events or talking with chief mourners as it was feared that it would bring bad luck both for mothers and infants. As the traditional extended family structure almost disappeared and a nuclear family system is prevailing in recent society, sanhujori services started to be provided by sanhujoriwons, which means a Korean-style private postpartum care center. This type of private centers was first introduced in 1996 in Korea.  Concepts  = Sanhujoriwon = A sanhujoriwon (ÏÇ∞ÌõÑÏ°∞Î¶¨Ïõê) is a private center which offers customized services both for mothers and their infants during the postpartum period. Until late 1998, the demand for sanhujoriwon had exceeded its supply and the simple opening of a sanhujoriwon usually guaranteed its success. As a result, poor-quality, unqualified centers had mushroomed before 2000. While many underqualified centers have since been closed due to poor management and fire incidents, the number of sanhujoriwons has increased gradually recently. According to a national survey, it was estimated that about 50 percent of the total female population in Korea have used such a postpartum center after childbirth, in 2012. The services include skin therapy, body massages, and 24/7 care of newborns. Some centers offer education programs of flower arrangement and laughter therapy to prevent postpartum depression. = Sanhujorisa = A sanhujorisa (ÏÇ∞ÌõÑÏ°∞Î¶¨ÏÇ¨) is a type of care worker who visits a mother's house and provides visiting services for postnatal care. Sanhujorisa workers are broadly categorized into part-time workers and co-living employees. Depending on broker agencies and the demands of mothers, they perform a variety of house chores, such as laundry, room cleaning, and care of other family members, alongside the sanhujori service itself. These days, as a result of globalization and a massive inflow of immigrant workers, Joseonjok immigrants, who migrate from Northeast China, are becoming the largest portion of the sanhujorisa job market. In the public sector, the YMCA, local governments, and public health centers are providing education programs to train professional sanhujorisa for a small payment or at no charge. On the other hand, in the private sector, Korea Qualification Development Center (KQDC) is granting certificates for those who successfully complete education programs and pass a qualification examination for the position. This job used to be known in English as a monthly nurse, but now may be called a \\"postnatal doula\\", \\"maternity nurse\\" or \\"newborn care specialist\\" ‚Äì all specialized nannies.  Practices  The main tenants of sanhujori emphasize activities and foods that keep the body warm, rest and relaxation to maximize the body's return to its normal state, maintaining cleanliness, eating nutritious foods, and peace of mind and heart. = Eating beneficial sanhujori foods = Seaweed soup in Korea To facilitate recovery after childbirth, many Korean mothers consume the specific type of Korean traditional cuisines, which is commonly called \\"sanhujori foods.\\" Common characteristics of sanhujori foods are summarized as being soft, warm, and refreshing while cuisines with spicy flavors are perceived to be bad for the postpartum period. Among a variety of sanhujori cuisines, seaweed soup is most widely consumed by Korean mothers. Researchers demonstrated that seaweed contains a great deal of omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., polyunsaturated fatty acids found in certain seeds and fish, and the soup with seaweed helps to accelerate the recovery time of mothers. Other than seaweed soup, Korean women also eat a variety of exotic, traditional dishes, such as a pork bone soup, ray soup, and dried cod soup (bugeoguk, Î∂ÅÏñ¥Íµ≠). = Keep one's body warm = To keep their body warm, Korean mothers avoid cold temperatures and cold foods such as ice cream and cold water. Staying indoors and refraining from outdoor activities is perceived as one of the effective ways to keep the mother's body warm. Even exposure to a cold breeze caused by the shutting of doors is a taboo in the period of the sanhujori practices. If a mother fails to keep their body warm, it is traditionally believed that she will become vulnerable to sanhubyung, which means a life-long illness after the postpartum period. = Doing moderate physical exercise = Childbirth tends to lower the immunity of mothers, and they may have pains and swellings in their bodies. During the postpartum period, Korean mothers do light stretching and self-massage of the muscles to relax and strengthen their bodies. It is scientifically proved that 30 minutes exercise, per day, is helpful in recovering the bladder and pelvic muscles rapidly.

Most of its members were English, but, originally, it included a significant core of members of Scottish descent. It is notable for its prohibition, then radical, of the extension of membership to any member of the press. In 1829, it occupied premises in Regent Street, renamed itself the Literary Union Club, and revised its membership statutes to make it less exclusive. It had over 700 members by 1831. After membership became too numerous, it subsequently renamed itself again, as the Clarence Club, occupied 12 Waterloo Place, Pall Mall and limited its membership to 600. It was dissolved in April 1834. Campbell's Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, founded in 1831, took most of its membership from the Clarence Club. The Literary Union Club The Literary Union Club was founded in 1829, by the poet Thomas Campbell, as a conversazione society for the arts, science, and literature. Members convened on a weekly basis, and, at each meeting, a member would present a paper, or make a speech, that would be discussed by the other members. Eminent merchants and businessmen were also accepted, but all journalists and press reporters were prohibited from joining. The founders were members of an exclusive dining club that had met in Conduit Street, Mayfair, since 1826, which had decided to expand by revising its membership statutes to make it less exclusive. The reformed Club, termed the Literary Union Club, is variously reported to have had a maximum of 400 or 500 members, and was planned as, \\"an attempt to restore that state of society which existed in the latter part of the seventeenth and during the greater portion of the eighteenth century ; when all who loved to dabble in ink, sought the coffee-houses frequented by the literary lions of the day, and derived as much amusement from their conversations as they had instructions from their writings.\\" The first meeting of the new Literary Union Club occurred at Campbell's residence at 10 Seymour Street, Connaught Square, the second at the residence, in Soho Square, of Henry William Pickersgill, R.A., who was admitted as a member. The Club took premises at old Athenaeum House, Regent Street, in 1829, and later moved to 12 Waterloo Place, Pall Mall. Its initial membership consisted of a core of gentlemen who had left the Athenaeum Club, London due to a disagreement with other members of the same: accordingly, the Literary Union Club was described as ‚Äòa sort of Junior Athenaeum‚Äô. It was intended that there would be a branch of new Literary Union Society in each of the major provincial towns and cities of the British Empire and in each capital city of Western Europe each of which would send delegates to the Parent Club in London, thereby creating an international Britannic Literary and Scientific Union, based in London, that would ‚Äòbring [‚Ä¶] England nearer than she is in resemblance to ancient Greece' (Campbell). However, associated societies were established only in Paris and Vienna. Each member of the Glasgow Campbell Club was granted an honorary place in the Literary Union Club. It was suggested that the members of the Club would distinguish themselves with a peculiar evening waistcoat, which would be worn, in public, with evening wear. By 1831, the Club had between 700 and 800 members and become so popular that nine out of every ten proposed candidates were blackballed. In addition to the initial distinguished members, numerous men of little distinction in the arts, science, or literature, had been admitted. As a consequence of this, in 1831, the Literary Union Club renamed itself the Clarence Club, expelled some of its previous members, and limited its membership to 600. The new club was governed by an Executive Committee of 100, led by the Chair, Campbell. However, the new, reduced, maximum number of members was deemed to be excessively large by many of the eminent founders, many of whom, dissatisfied with Campbell's incompetent leadership, left and returned to the Athenaeum Club, London as a consequence of which the Clarence closed, in 1834. The membership of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, also founded, in 1831, by Campbell, was drawn mainly from the Clarence Club. Behaviour Known for its 'undue devotion to the juice of the grateful grape', the 1831 Annual Ball of the Club was described thus: Such behaviour led the members of the Athenaeum Club to satirically describe the Literary Union Club as 'anything but Literary or United' and led the periodical The Age to describe the Literary Union Club as a Club whose meetings were convened on the promise of 'tea and toast' but concluded in 'a bear-garden of a row'.

He is the current nominee to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, and he previously served as a U.S. Senate staffer and as a Department of Defense official. Education and early career Billingslea received a B.A. from Dartmouth College and an M.A. in Law and Diplomacy from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. He began his career as an aide to Senator Jesse Helms, serving as a Senior Professional Staff Member for National Security Affairs on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Bush Administration In 2001, Billingslea became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiations Policy in the Pentagon's Office of International Security Policy. During the administration of George W. Bush, Billingslea served in the United States Department of Defense as Deputy Under Secretary of the Navy, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiation Policy. Billingslea served in Brussels as the Assistant Secretary General of NATO for Defense Investment. As the United States‚Äô senior civilian official serving within the alliance, he oversaw NATO's military investment programs and infrastructure budget, and worked closely with Defense and Finance Ministers across the Alliance. He was Chairman of the Conference of National Armament Directors and Chairman of NATO's C3 Board. As Department of Defense's senior civilian for special operations (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict), Billingslea provided oversight for all special operations efforts against al-Qaeda following the September 11 attacks. Billingslea was a principal architect of the Department of Defense's worldwide effort against terrorist organizations. Under his leadership, Special Operations Command and its components greatly accelerated acquisition of a wide range of novel technologies and capabilities to aid special operations forces in the conduct of the Global War on Terror. Between 2002 and 2003, Billingslea was involved in the Bush administration's enhanced interrogation techniques policy. Private sector career (2009‚Äì2017) Between 2009 and 2017, Billingslea served as Managing Director at Deloitte, responsible for its Business Intelligence Services group, where he provided due diligence services for a wide range of Federal clients and Fortune 500 companies. Trump Administration During the presidential transition of Donald Trump, Billingslea headed the United States National Security Council team. In April 2017, Billingslea was nominated by President Donald Trump to become Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the United States Department of the Treasury. He was confirmed by the United States Senate by a vote of 65‚Äì35 on June 22, 2017. During his tenure in the Treasury Department, Billingslea worked with members of the national security community throughout the U.S. government, foreign governments, and the private sector to identify and address threats posed or advanced by illicit finance. His areas of focus include money laundering, terrorist financing, WMD proliferation, and other criminal and illicit activities domestically and internationally. He led specific efforts to counter threats including proliferation, terrorism, and the deceptive financial practices posed by countries such as Iran and North Korea. Among other actions, he criticized Turkey over its role in Venezuela's gold trade, and he imposed sanctions against Hezbollah. In August 2018, Billingslea was nominated to be the next Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. His nomination was opposed by a coalition of twenty-one human rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, on the grounds that Billingslea had a \\"well-documented history of advocating for the use of torture and other unlawful interrogation practices.\\" Others, including the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), wrote in support of his nomination with a letter challenging all of the claims made by these other groups. President Trump renominated him for the position in January 2019. Billingslea's involvement with controversial Bush administration interrogation techniques stalled his nomination. On April 10, 2020, Trump appointed Billingslea as the Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control. He is leading the U.S. negotiations with Russia on whether to extend the New START treaty and extend it to include China. On May 1, 2020, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Billingslea to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, and the White House sent his nomination to the Senate on May 4, 2020.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  In February 2018, Billingslea was endorsed unanimously by the 37 member countries of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) as the next FATF President. The FATF Secretariat is housed at the OECD headquarters in Paris. The FATF presidency tenure is for one year, a position which Billingslea held from July 1, 2018, until June 30, 2019. During his tenure, the FATF established new standards to govern the regulation of virtual assets (crypto- currencies) and conversion of the FATF principle that terrorist financing must be criminalized, even absent a direct tie to a terrorist act, into binding international law pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2462.

Background Bishop Mountain Look was constructed between 1936 and 1938 by members of Company 2515 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), based at Camp Porcupine (F-405), as a fire lookout for the United States Forest Service in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first ran for the office of President of the United States, America was in the midst of The Great Depression, with economic recovery uncertain. Roosevelt campaigned in 1932 on the promise, \\"I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.\\" The CCC, which operated 1933‚Äì1942, was part of his New Deal program, providing unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. In Idaho, the CCC, employed 80,000 men, a larger per capita ratio than any other state. The steel construction fire lookout tower is topped by a steel cab manufactured by Aermotor Company of Chicago. It is situated at an elevation of on the summit of Bishop Mountain, an extinct volcanic vent on the rim of the Island Park Caldera. The log cabin was built as a 16'x24' one-room, screened-porch structure, with a \\"vault toilet\\" in a separate building. The cabin, which has no running water, electricity, bed linens or other basic amenities, is currently available for rental through the National Forest Service. Much of the road access is paved with only gravel, and can only be accessed by snowmobile during many of the winter months.

Hall was also known as Clea. At the time of her disappearance, Cleashindra, whom everyone called Clea, was two weeks away from graduating high school; she was an honor student; had landed a summer internship at a Boston pediatrician's office; and had been accepted into the pre-med program at Tennessee State University. Background Cleashindra Hall was an honors student at her high school. In May 1994, Hall attended her senior prom. Hall was expected to graduate later that month, and had been chosen to give a commencement speech at the graduation ceremony. Hall disappeared two weeks prior to her expected graduation, and never attended the ceremony. Hall intended to follow a career as a pediatrician. She was expected to enroll in pre-medical courses at Tennessee State University. Hall held an after-school job at the home office of Dr. Larry Amos. The office was located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. After finishing her work hours, Hall typically called one of her parents to ask for a ride home. Hall had no previous history of leaving without telling anyone. She was reportedly not a \\"troubled teen\\" and had no known reason to voluntarily escape her life. Hall did not have a boyfriend at the time of her disappearance. Disappearance Hall disappeared sometime after 8:30 p.m. on May 9, 1994. She was last seen while leaving her after school job at the home office of 43-year-old Dr. Larry Amos in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Hall last called her mother just after 8 p.m, but she was not ready to return yet. She told her mother to expect a second phone call when the time came for her ride home. The second phone call never took place. Dr. Amos told the police that Hall had gotten into a car with an unknown individual after she had finished work at his office. Hall was last seen wearing a white shirt and short set with a navy blue polka dot pattern on one side and stripes on the other side, with white socks and white athletic shoes. Laurell Hall (Hall's mother) fell asleep while waiting for her daughter to call. She awoke around 1:00 a.m. on May 10, 1994. The mother soon realized that Hall had never called for her ride, and had yet to return home. Hall's parents reported her missing on May 10, but they were told that police regulations required a 24-hour waiting period before the police would take any missing persons report. Investigation and aftermath The police rebuffed Hall's mother's initial attempt to report her missing, claiming that she would have to be missing for 24 hours before her disappearance could be reported. Some people think that Hall may have tried to walk home and was abducted, and others think she may have run away. Two weeks following Hall's disappearance, the police searched the home of Dr. Amos, which also served as his office, since that was the last place where Hall had been seen. According to Laurell Hall, there was \\"no sign of a struggle there\\". However Hall's mother believed that Dr. Amos had enough time to discard any evidence potentially left from such a struggle. In her opinion, the police should not have waited weeks to examine a potential crime scene. Lt. Terry Hopson of the Pine Bluff Police Department has reported that their search of the Amos home failed to turn up any evidence that Hall was either injured or attacked there. Dr. Larry Amos' property has been searched pursuant to a warrant. Larry Amos is considered a person of interest. Police do believe Hall left with someone she knew. Her disappearance was featured in an episode of Find Our Missing. According to Terry Hopson, the local police \\"have spent many hours and manpower on this case over the years\\", and the investigation was still ongoing in 2009. The local police considers the Hall case likely to involve kidnapping, but reportedly had no clues to the identity of any potential kidnappers. Dr. Amos reported seeing Hall entering someone's car, but did not see who was driving and could offer no description of the vehicle. Hall did not have a mobile phone with her, and the case predates the mobile phone tracking methods used by police in other missing person cases. An early suspect in the case was a local boy, whose name was not given to the press. Hall reportedly liked him and acted friendly with him. The boy was subjected to police interrogation and his vehicle was searched, but the police could not connect him to the disappearance and he did not provide any leads. The boy was also subjected to a polygraph test, but the results were inconclusive. Physical description Hall had dark skin and was considered a black person. Her reported height was 5'8\\" (1.73 metres). She weighed 120 pounds (54.55 kilograms). She had \\"dark eyes\\" and \\"dark hair\\". She had short hair at the time of her disappearance, and wore it in a ponytail when last seen. Her only other distinctive feature was a surgical scar on her left knee.

He is employed by cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic. Hutchins is from Ilfracombe in Devon. Early life Hutchins is the elder son of Janet, a Scottish nurse, and Desmond Hutchins, a Jamaican social worker, along with his younger brother. Around 2003, when Hutchins was nine years old, the parents moved the family from urban Bracknell, near London, to rural Devon. Hutchins had shown early aptitude with computers and learned simple hacking skills early on such as bypassing security on school computers to install video game software. In addition, he spent time learning to be a surf lifeguard. He became involved with an online forum that promoted malware development, more as a means to show off their skills to each other rather than for nefarious purposes. When he was about 14 years old, he created his own contribution, a password stealer based on Internet Explorer's AutoFill feature, which was met with approval by the forum. He spent much of his time with this community to the extent his school work began to fail. When the school's systems were compromised, the school authorities claimed Hutchins was the culprit. Though he denied any involvement, school authorities permanently suspended him from using the computers at school, which further pushed Hutchins to skip school more often and spend more time in the malware forums. Career =Creating UPAS Kit and Kronos= At around this time, the original malware forums had been closed, and Hutchins transferred to another hacker community, HackForums. In this new forum, members were expected to show more skill by demonstrating possession of a botnet. Hutchins, 15 years old at the time, successfully created an 8,000-computer botnet for HackForums by tricking BitTorrent users into running his fake files to take control of their machines. From this exploit, Hutchins saw financial opportunities for his hacking skills, though at the time he did not feel these were tied to any type of cybercrime, as he stated in a 2020 interview. These activities included setting up \\"ghosted\\" web hosting for others on the HackForums for \\"all illegal sites\\" except child porn, and created custom malware, often based on evaluating how others' rootkits operated. According to Hutchins in later interviews and in his plea agreement, when he was around 16, having gained a reputation in hacking circles for his custom malware, he was approached by an online entity he knew only as \\"Vinny\\", who asked him to write a well- maintained, multifaceted rootkit that could be sold on multiple hacker marketplaces, with Hutchins to be paid half of the profits of each sale. Hutchins agreed, and by mid-2012, had completed writing UPAS Kit, named after the poisonous upas tree. During this period, Hutchins had once complained in his conversations with Vinny about the lack of good weed in the country. Vinny asked for his address, which Hutchins gave, and later on his 17th birthday, he received a package full of various recreational drugs. Sales of UPAS Kit earned Hutchins thousands of dollars through bitcoin, allowing him to drop out of school and live a comfortable life, though he kept the nature of his work secret from his family. Vinny shortly came back to Hutchins to ask him to write UPAS Kit 2.0, specifically adding keylogging and web inject for browser form pages. At this point, Hutchins recognized these features were likely for targeting financial transactions on bank websites, and thus he would be enabling cybercrime if he wrote the update. Hutchins told Vinny that he refused to write such code, but Vinny held him over the fact he knew his name and address from his prior gift of recreational drugs and was willing to give that to the FBI if Hutchins did not cooperate. Hutchins reached an agreement to add in the keylogging to UPAS Kit 2.0 but left out anything to do with web inject, which took another nine months to complete. After this, he learned from Vinny that Vinny had hired another programmer to update UPAS Kit with the web injects, and now wanted Hutchins and this programmer to work together to combine the code to a single package. Though he was ethically torn on the decision, Hutchins opted to continue working with Vinny to at least make sure he got paid for the work that he did already do, though procrastinated as much as he could. The new code was completed by June 2014, and as Vinny started selling it to the dark web he renamed UPAS Kit 2.0 to Kronos, based on the mythological Greek Titan. =MalwareTech and Kryptos Logic= After Kronos was released, around when Hutchins was 19, his family moved to Ilfracombe. Hutchins had entered community college prior to this and was struggling between completing his last year of work and the fixes to Kronos demanded by Vinny, further complicated with a drug addiction he gained while working on Kronos. During this time, he met a person he knew as \\"Randy\\" online through hacking forums. Randy, who was based in Los Angeles, had sought a banking rootkit like Kronos, which Hutchins did not mention, but led to longer talks to learn that Randy had more philanthropic goals. To help Randy, Hutchins offered to help him with trading bitcoin. However, a power failure one night caused Hutchins to lose more than of Randy's bitcoin, and in exchange, Hutchins revealed his connection to Kronos and offered a free copy to Randy. After they had completed that deal, Hutchins realized the mistake he had made in revealing this to a stranger, and started to fear he would be approached by law enforcement. Hutchins graduated from community college in 2015 and dropped his drug addiction cold turkey. He put off requests from Vinny for updates to Kronos claiming he was busy with schoolwork, until soon the requests stopped as well as any further payments from Vinny. After several months of dread, he decided to start an anonymously written blog on deep analysis of hacks that he called MalwareTech, based on what he had learned evaluating others' rootkits and his own work on UPAS Kit and Kronos, though he spoke nothing of his connection to these rootkits. As new rootkits appeared, Hutchins began reverse engineering those and writing the details on MalwareTech, such as the Kelihos and Necurs botnet, and wrote his own botnet tracking service that could join the botnet and monitor what operations the controllers of the botnets were doing. His writings drew the interest of Kryptos Logic's CEO Salim Neino, who offered the writer a job. Hutchins accepted; while still working from Ilfracombe, he would reverse engineer new botnets and provide the detailed information to Kryptos Logic while writing on the high-level functionality he had discovered to MalwareTech, while Kryptos Logic would monitor the botnets for ongoing cybersecurity threats. Through this relationship, Hutchins' reputation via his MalwareTech identity grew, being called a \\"reversing savant\\" by a former NSA hacker, though only a few associates at Kryptos knew of his true identity. Hutchins and Kryptos Logic were instrumental in stopping one offshoots of the Mirai botnet/distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2016 that had hit Lloyds Bank, as Hutchins had been able to plead to the hacker behind it, once he had tracked him down, with his own experiences to convince him to stop the botnet. =Stopping WannaCry= The WannaCry cryptoworm attack had started around 12 May 2017; using an exploit in Microsoft Windows' Server Message Block, it quickly spread from its initial point of injection believed to be in Asia to over 230,000 computers in 150 countries within the day. Computers infected were seemingly locked out from use and could be unlocked only if the user sent a quantity of bitcoin to a given account. Hutchins had become aware of WannaCry the afternoon of 12 May, and though he had been on vacation, he began reverse engineering the code from his bedroom. He discovered that the malware tied to an odd-looking domain name, suggesting the malware would be part of a command-and-control structure common to botnets, but to his surprise, the domain name was not registered. He quickly registered the domain and set up servers at Kryptos Logic within it to act as honeypots, allowing them to track the infected computers. While the WannaCry worm continued to spread over the next few hours, security researchers found that because Hutchins had registered the domain name when he did, WannaCry would not execute further, effectively the worm's killswitch. Hutchins and Kryptos, along with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, spent the next several days maintaining the honeypot servers from additional DDoS attacks, some restarted by ongoing Mirai botnets as to make sure the killswitch remained active while Microsoft and other security workers rushed to patch the exploit in the Server Message Block and issue it to end users. A separate effort from French cybersecurity researches found a method to unlock and decrypt affected computers without having to pay the ransom. Hutchins' work, as MalwareTech, to stop WannaCry, was highly praised, but this led to the press figuring out Hutchins' identity behind MalwareTech in the days that followed. Hutchins tried to avoid the press including the more-invasive tabloids who had published his name and address tied to the MalwareTech name, though did agree to a single Associated Press interview under his real name, trying to defuse the \\"hero\\" perception he had been given. In this coverage, he kept his past history quiet, simply stating that he got his job with Kryptos Logic based on his software skills and MalwareTech blog hobbies he developed during school. He gained a type of a celebrity status within the cybersecurity world for his actions against WannaCry, and plans were made for him to attend the 2017 DEF CON cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas that August. =Arrest over Kronos= On 3 August 2017, Hutchins was arrested by the FBI as he was preparing to return to England from DEF CON on six hacking-related federal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin for creating and spreading Kronos in 2014 and 2015. Based on documents obtained by Vice through Freedom of Information Act requests, the FBI had tied Hutchins to Kronos after they had seized the assets of AlphaBay in July 2017, where they found evidence of at least one sale of Kronos. The FBI had obtained copies of his conversations with Randy from another dark web server seizure prior to AlphaBay to prove his connection to the software, which he confessed to while questioned. Hutchins was kept in a Las Vegas prison overnight after calling Neino about his plight. Neino alerted his own associates, which set off a chain of alerts across the cybersecurity community about Hutchins' situation, though many mistakenly believed that the arrest was due to the WannaCry attacks. A large number of cybersecurity workers and hackers rallied to his aid to help make Hutchins' bail, though as some of the contributions included stolen credit cards and bitcoin, it raised further suspicions on Hutchins' activities; ultimately, Tarah Wheeler and her husband Deviant Ollam were able to front the bail money and help find Hutchins a place in Los Angeles to live as he was barred from leaving the country. At his arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was put under house arrest in Los Angeles, initially with strict curfew limits and GPS monitoring but these were lifted after a few months. Hutchins had intended his \\"not guilty\\" to be used as part of a plea bargain with the FBI, rather than to deny any involvement with Kronos, though some in the hacker community took this as his denial, and vocally fought for Hutchins' release on this claim. In early 2018, the FBI began to negotiate with Hutchins as they desired information he had on Vinny and several other hackers that he knew, offering to reduce his sentence to a zero-prison term. Hutchins could not provide any significant information about Vinny, and did not want to reveal information on the other hackers, refusing the offer. The FBI added four charges to his indictment by June 2018, which Hutchins was told by his lawyers was in response to refusing their offer. On 19 April 2019 Hutchins pleaded guilty to two of the ten charges, conspiring to commit wire fraud, as well as distributing, selling, promoting, and advertising a device used to intercept electronic communications. His statement included the quote \\"I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes. Having grown up, I‚Äôve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes.\\" Hutchins faced up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for the two charges. On 26 July 2019, Judge Joseph Peter Stadtmueller sentenced Hutchins to time served and one year of supervised release, recognizing that Hutchins had \\"turned the corner\\" from using his skills for criminal purpose into beneficial uses well before he had faced justice. Hutchins stated that while he would like to stay in Los Angeles, he expects following the year of supervised release he will be deported back to the United Kingdom, as he had long overstayed his travel visa.

Prior to assuming that role, he was the Director of Immigration Policy in the Office of Policy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Early life and education Cissna is the son of a Peruvian immigrant. He graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in physics and political science. He also attended Columbia University and obtained a Master of Arts (M.A.) in international affairs, as well as Georgetown University Law Center, where he received his Juris Doctor (J.D.). Career =Public sector= Cissna worked at the U.S. Department of State, serving as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer stationed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and Stockholm, Sweden. He also worked in the Office of the Chief Counsel under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Cissna also served on the staff of Senator Chuck Grassley. Cissna was the Director of Immigration Policy in the Office of Policy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where he created and administered policy focused on immigration benefits programs, including with respect to temporary workers and immigrants. He was also Chair of the OECD Working Party on Migration. =Private sector= Cissna was an attorney at the law firm of Kaufman & Canoles in Richmond, Virginia, working in the immigration group. He also practiced law at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Kirkpatrick & Lockhart LLP in their international trade practice group. USCIS Director =Nomination= On April 8, 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Cissna as Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. That agency is under the Department of Homeland Security, where Cissna currently works as director of immigration policy in the Office of Policy. The Trump administration was interested in Cissna due to his work on the displacement of U.S. workers by foreign workers on H-1B visas. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, stated that Cissna is \\"very knowledgeable about the immigration system\\" and knows \\"all of the wrinkles of this stuff.\\" On April 25, 2017, Cissna's nomination was received in the U.S. Senate and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 5, 2017. =Tenure= In February 2018, Cissna announced a new mission statement for USCIS. The new mission statement no longer included the phrase \\"USCIS secures America's promise as a nation of immigrants.\\" When asked about the removal of this phrase, Cissna said the U.S. is \\"indisputably a nation of immigrants\\" and that the agency's mission was \\"not something where you put eternal professions of American values. That sort of thing belongs chiseled in the wall of a monument, not in some bureaucratic mission statement.\\" Cissna had a role in the Trump administration family separation policy. In June 2018, Cissna issued a new policy memo directing USCIS to investigate \\"thousands of old fingerprint records and files to determine whether foreigners made false or fraudulent statements in their attempts to obtain legal residency in the United States.\\" According to a September 2018 profile in Politico, as the head of USCIS, Cissna has \\"transformed his agency into more of an enforcement body and less of a service provider.\\" =Resignation= On April 7, 2019, rumors began to float that White House advisor Stephen Miller was pressuring for the replacement of Cissna as part of larger purge of immigration and homeland security officials in the Trump administration. Sources indicated that Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which pushes for lower levels of immigration, was being considered as an option to lead the agency. Leaders of anti-immigration groups, including Rosemary Jenks at NumbersUSA, RJ Hauman at FAIR, and Mark Krikorian at Center for Immigration Studies, pushed for Cissna to remain at the head of USCIS, calling him effective at his work and skillful within the bounds of the law at restricting legal immigration to the United States. Senator Grassley referred to a potential firing of Cissna as \\"a real mistake ... to fire good people like that.\\" On May 24, 2019, Cissna announced in an email to USCIS employees that he had submitted his resignation at the request of President Trump, effective June 1. Personal life Cissna's wife's mother came to the U.S. as a Palestinian refugee in 1957. Cissna speaks English and Spanish. He has two children.

Wilkinson The Women's Congress of the Chicago Exposition of 1893, awakened the public to the fact that matters pertaining to the household had not kept up with the procession of progress. Therefore, a day was appointed in which to investigate this neglected science and the result was the organization of an association aimed to benefit the home makers of this country and to be National in scope. The organization took as its name The National Household Economic Association, and Laura Starr Ware Wilkinson of Chicago, was elected its first president, and Ellen Martin Henrotin, honorary president. Mrs. Wilkinson proved to be an efficient executive leader, and with the assistance of Henrotin and many other well known women, was able to induce the Women's Clubs of the country, to take an active interest in all education pertaining to the betterment of the home. The Association planned to work especially through women's clubs. Wilkinson was followed as president, by Ellen Harbart, of Illinois, and Dr. Mary E. Green, of Michigan, succeeded Harbart as president. By this time, the organization had become generally recognized through the efforts of State vice-presidents who in turn presented the subject and supplied literature to the clubs and educational institutions of their representative states. During Green's presidency, Household Economics was given a place on the program of the conventions of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and also at many of the meetings of the State Federations. Green was called upon to speak at these meetings as also were many other workers in the field. The subject met with an enthusiastic reception at the Denver Biennial of the General Federation, and the women throughout the West were ready to enlist in this new, yet very old, enterprise. Linda Hull Larned, of New York State, succeeded Green and under her regime, the subject found favor at all the Biennial conventions during the four years that she was in office, with 35 States, as well as Canada, represented by vice-presidents. Larned not only presented the subject at these National and State meetings, but was invited by Mr. Peck, to the Paris Exposition, to take part in the series of Congresses that were held in the Palais de Congress during that summer and was given a prominent place on the program of Women's Works and Institutions at this Congress. The Association held its annual meetings during the ten years of its existence, in different states, and at the invitation of local organizations, its last meeting was held in Toledo, Ohio, October, 1903. As by this time the objects and aims of the Association had become thoroughly incorporated in the work of the General and State Federations of Women's Clubs, and as the Lake Placid Conference was now doing much better work along the same lines, it was decided at the Toledo meeting to merge the work of the Association into that of the Committee of Household Economics of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The following year the first report of a committee on Household Economics was made at a General Federation Convention, at the meeting in St. Louis in 1904. The National Household Economic Association published and circulated annual reports containing summaries of work and progress in the States, and from time to time, published Outlines of Study, and also addresses of importance given at its annual conventions. The Association was entertained two or three times in Chicago, and once in Atlanta, in Toronto, in Buffalo, in Milwaukee and Toledo. By 1903, there were many schools of Domestic Science in flourishing existence which owed their inspiration to the efforts of the workers in the National Household Economic Association, and in many towns and cities, it was more or less instrumental in introducing manual training and domestic science for girls in the public schools. The organization disbanded in 1903. Standing committees 1\\\\.

The attack was carried out by two Palestinian militants, who entered the community on April 27, 2002, and proceeded to shoot people in their homes and in the streets. In the attack, four civilians were killed and seven were injured. Adora is located in the Judean Mountains, in the Southern West Bank, northwest of Hebron. Context The attack occurred during the Second Intifada. It occurred several days after Israeli forces killed the Palestinian militant, Marwan Zalloum, a leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) claimed responsibility for the attack. Attack The attack took place in the morning on the Jewish Sabbath. Many of the Adora residents were attending Sabbath prayers in the synagogue when the attack began. The two attackers entered the settlement by cutting a 3-foot wide hole in the security fence, but no alarm was triggered as the fence was not electrified. The attackers were wearing IDF uniforms and black flak jackets to confuse responders. They were armed with an M-17 and a Kalashnikov assault riffle. The element of surprise allowed the attackers to stay in the settlement for about 15 minutes. Shortly after 9:00am one of the attackers entered the Shefi family house and began to search for family members room to room. He first found the 5-year-old girl Danielle Shefi in her bed, who he proceeded to shoot dead. He then found her brothers Eliad (4) and Uriel (2), who he shot and injured, then he found their mother, Shir Shefi, who he also shot and injured. The attacker then moved to the Harari family house, where he failed to gain entry, so shot out the windows. The second attacker attempted to gain entry to the Eliezer family home by knocking at the door, but after this failed he entered the Greenberg home, where he shot Vladimir and Katya Greenberg in their beds, killing the wife and injuring the husband. When the local security team arrived, at first they mistook the attackers for IDF soldiers and called out to them. Responder Arik Becker was killed in the initial round of gunfire. Israeli police joined the security team, causing the attackers to flee. Ya‚Äôakov Katz was killed in a burst of gunfire while the attackers were running through the streets. The attackers fled through a hole in the security fence in the direction of the village of Tuffah. One of the attackers was later killed by IDF troops.

Biography  Born in Milan, Guia Risari graduated from the Liceo Parini in 1990. She went on to study Ethics at university, getting her degree in 1995 with a thesis on Jean Am√©ry, at the same time working as a journalist for l'Unit√† and as an educationalist; she also took part as a volunteer in the humanitarian mission at the refugee camp of Klana.Most biographical details are available on the website. Risari then took up an in-depth study of antisemitism, getting a master's degree in \\"Modern Jewish Studies\\" in 1997 from the University of Leeds. Beginning in 1998, she spent a long period in France to continue her studies in Montpellier, Toulouse and Paris. Between 1999 and 2008 she divided her time between the Sorbonne and Sapienza University of Rome. In the same period, she worked as a librarian, teacher, translator, journalist, writer and lecturer, while never abandoning her work as a volunteer. During the time spent abroad Guia always maintained a strong emotional bond with her family, to whom she gives credit for having stimulated her dialectic capacity. Guia Risari is often the translator of her own works, which are published in various languages. Her studies, along with Surrealism, a sensitivity towards minorities and her regard for children are all re-elaborated in her writing, to which she has devoted herself since 2001.  Literary works  With the exception of her translations and essays, Guia Risari‚Äôs writings are usually accompanied by illustrations created by different artists: for example, the colors of Elisa Macellari for Il decamerino or Cecco Mariniello for Pane e oro and La macchina di Celestino, the collages of Marc Taeger for Achille il puntino, or the pencil drawings of Arianna Floris for La porta di Anne. Il pesce spada e la serratura is illustrated by Altan and recalls the Surrealistic game of exquisite corpses. Il taccuino di Simone Weil is accompanied by the illustrations of Pia Valentinis. The novel tells the true story of Simone Weil and the historical scenario in which she lived, in the form of an imaginary diary. Published in an artisan printing house, and furnished with a bookmark, the volume is presented in the style of a real diary: the pages are \\"in natural paper made of cotton fibres‚Äù and the binding is held together with elastic. La terre respire, with watercolors by Alessandro Sanna, represents \\"a hymn to the power of nature\\"; Le chat √¢me, illustrated by Ghislaine Herb√©ra, narrates the story of a cat, regarded as an ‚Äúanimal-guide, a sort of ancestral double‚Äù; Le Petit Chaperon bleu, with pictures by Cl√©mence Pollet, is a \\"Surreal version of Little Red Riding Hood\\". The interaction between writing and graphics and the supervision of the edition, typical of book arts, are also the very characteristics of Surrealism, especially feminine surrealism. Similarly, elements common to literary works of feminine Surrealism are the artists‚Äô book, interdisciplinary features, the use of fairy-tales populated by magical creatures and cats regarded as alter egos, the attention given to nature and recourse to the imagination and writing in order to combat negativity and racial prejudice. = Children‚Äôs books and novels = In general, Guia Risari‚Äôs writings for children are part of the new Italian literary model of the 21st century, through which children are urged into active and critical reading, encouraged to re-elaborate reality in a creative way. The child protagonist in Pane e oro, for example, manages to overcome her humble conditions with her imagination, with only the help of a piece of paper and a pencil. Achille il puntino, also published in Spain and included in a catalogue entitled Born to Read, provides young readers with tools for discovering new worlds through speaking, literature and writing. The dot, in fact, contains in itself a multitude of meanings and images which come to life and change. Through successive metamorphoses, the dot makes it possible to visualize anthropomorphic forms and stimulates children to question the human body, an object of curiosity and mystery. The ‚Äúsalvific power of imagination‚Äù resists even the most tragic reality, like that of Anne Frank, which Guia Risari revisits in La porta di Anne,Ill. by A. Floris Mondadori, 2016, , coll. Contemporanea; coll. Oscar Junior, 2017, ; Finalist in the Prize Cento 2016-17. in which the persecution of the Jews is narrated so as to remain impressed in the memory of all readers. It is a creative transposition made up of many elements from her studies in anti-Semitism, which previously bore fruit in her essay-writing. Il viaggio di LeaIll. by I. Bruno, EL Einaudi Ragazzi, 2016, . was Finalist in the \\"Premio Strega Ragazze e Ragazzi\\" 2016-17, Category +11. = Studies in anti-Semitism = Guia Risari dealt with anti-Semitism from a philosophical point of view during her academic studies in Leeds, going on to analyze the characteristics of Italian anti-Semitism through the work of Giorgio Bassani. Risari makes reference, above all, to the critical approach of the Frankfurt School and the analyses carried out by Zygmunt Bauman on the relationship between modernity and the Holocaust, on the basis of which the characteristics of recent times (order, homogeneity and function) have aggravated the ancient prejudice against the Jews, always regarded as the ‚Äúother‚Äù, ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, to be isolated and destroyed. For the first time, the bureaucratic machine takes on that task, relieving the individual of responsibility. Approaching Il romanzo di Ferrara by Bassani, Guia Risari also takes into consideration the literary testimony of the Holocaust. The literature of the Holocaust, through various phases from diaries to essays, poetry and stories, is transformed into an instrument of commemoration, interpretation and elaboration of the events and traumas. In Romanzo di Ferrara, Risari recognizes the complexity of a work that is ‚Äúat the same time an historical narrative and a personal document‚Äù, in which Bassani is both a ‚Äúreporter and witness, describing with increasing awareness the scene of a personal and collective trauma‚Äù, yet maintaining a calm tone. The emphasis of Bassani, in fact, is on the need to preserve the memory of an event, the Holocaust, which has stained a part of humanity, and not on the commiseration of the victims nor the cruelty of the tormentors: in other words, what counts is the right to exist of every living being. In The document within the walls, written in English, Guia Risari probes Bassani‚Äôs narrative with accuracy, even verifying the number of those who died on the Lapide di via Mazzini, and utilizing an interpretive model that puts to good use the means of both literary and social criticism. The aim of her research is to examine anti-Semitism in Italy during the Fascist period as it is described in Romanzo di Ferrara, which should be regarded as ‚Äúnot a simple collection of stories, but rather a true document‚Äù about Jewish integration and Italian betrayal, about the Fascist persecution and the painful disillusion of the victims. The writer expresses doubts about the ‚Äúmyth of good Italians‚Äù that is based on the fact that the Italian persecution of Jews was less ferocious than that of the Nazis. In Jean Am√©ry. Il risentimento come morale, a work derived from her graduate thesis and for which Guia Risari won five awards, the writer suggests a re-evaluation of the idea of resentment, which she considers ‚Äúthe only way to moralize life and history‚Äù. The resentment of the survivors of the concentration camps is indicated as the only way to emend history, without forgetting or pardoning it, and is reassessed in the wake of Adorno and Horkheimer; i.e. it is freed from being a pathological or unsound reaction. Am√©ry makes public his resentment with no false modesty: ‚Äúthe fundamental insight of Am√©ry consists precisely in having understood the complex ambivalence of resentment, which is the refusal of the present and, at the same time, an emotional and existential bond with the past‚Äù, a \\"multiform revolt of the soul, which makes it possible to save and revive the memory of the offence without obscuring the use of critical reason\\". The necessity of not forgetting is taken up again in the introductory essay by Guia Risari for the Italian edition of Le sang du ciel by Piotr Rawicz (translated by the same Risari), which reintroduces the double role of the writer as witness and narrator of the Holocaust, reasserting the importance of giving voice to the pain caused by others for no reason so that it will not be forgotten.

Originally started as a website, the company now includes a webpage, social media accounts, a podcast, a national comedy tour, merchandise, and two best-selling books, I Had A Nice Time And Other Lies... and Nice Is Just A Place In France. History The Betches Love This website began in February 2011 and was authored by Aleen Kuperman, Jordana Abraham, and Samantha Fishbein. It is modeled after Bros Like This Site, which was founded in 2009. Each of the three women invested $1,500 into the company. The three women chose the name \\"Betches\\" because they heard young women saying the word because they did not want to be called a Bitch. Betches Love This was shortened to \\"Betches\\" as the brand developed into a larger humor category discussing topics such as celebrities, health and fitness, politics, and TV and movie recaps. The Betches put forth multiple social media posts a week for their fans. The three women claim to \\"'say what people are thinking about the world, but no one's said out loud.'\\" Betches has been called the female counterpart to the bro fraternity culture by The New York Times. The three co-creators have been labeled as authors, entrepreneurs and humorists by Dan Rather. The three women behind Betches support the mantra of \\"not taking yourself too seriously and being confident in who you are.\\" A 2015 Vogue article discussed the incredible impact a Betches reference has on a product or service as their following is \\"obsessive\\" and their page has been named as one of the top accounts to follow by Harper's Bazaar and Rolling Stone. In 2011, while seniors at Cornell University, Jordana Abraham, Samantha Fishbein, and Aleen Kuperman created Betches in the form of a WordPress blog. The three seniors targeted girls that were \\"'edgy, speak their minds, and unapologetic in regards to their beliefs and opinions'\\" The blog was first designed to counteract the male humor that was receiving a high level of attention from young men. The humor of the three women was targeted towards the \\"anti-alphamale\\", while also making jokes towards the \\"nice girl\\" via their discussions on celebrities, fashion, and relationship advice. Currently, Betches post on beauty, lifestyle, career, horoscope, and many others.  Education  The three women grew up in a New York suburb. The women attended Roslyn High School in Long Island. The three women graduated from Cornell University, where they roomed together their senior year.  Business  Abraham, Fishbein, and Kuperman all lacked backgrounds in business, but each had family connections to those who specialized in law or business to help their company blossom. After graduation, all three women still lived at their parents house, allowing them to meet with each other and work on their platform. The women reached their success with hard work and learning from their mistakes. The women hired an ad buyer who helped the women realize that their readers were more interested in their Instagram account, rather than their website. The women partnered with smaller jewelry and fashion companies to get their name out, but these attempts did not lead to the results the women strived for. In 2015, Betches and their experience with their dating columns, linked with Bumble. Bumble purchased a package of Instagram advertisements and sponsored the Betches' second book's launch party. Most recently, the Betches brand partnered with e-commerce site JustFab to launch an subscription-based clothing line that is affordable. Forbes has estimated that in 2017, their 3rd year of earning profit, the women behind Betches earned more than $5 million in revenue, 75% of which came from brand partnerships. The women still own the company fully and have not had to seek out investors.  Books  The Betches have published two New York Times Best Selling books. The books are categorized as \\"satire self help\\". = Nice Is Just a Place in France: How to Win at Basically Everything = This was the first book published by the Betches. The book provides readers with information regarding all aspects of life and focuses a lot on friend groups. = I Had a Nice Time And Other Lies...: How to Find Love & Sh*t Like That = This was the second book published by the Betches. The book provides readers with dating and relationship advice. The book teaches women how to act in order to be prepared to find love, and how to respond when a women does not like her engagement ring. = When's Happy Hour?: Work Hard So You Can Hardly Work = This was the third book published by the Betches. The book provides readers with professional life hacks so you can get ahead at your job and \\"basically be the Beyonce of anything you aspire to do.\\"  Criticism  The women behind the Betches have faced a little bit of backlash in regards to their content. Readers have commented on how the authors speak about taking Adderall to stay focused and being anorexic to stay thin. In April 2012, Abraham wrote a post titled \\"How To: Get People To Accuse You of Having an Eating Disorder\\" in which the advice to not eating food when with a group was given. The post has been removed from the internet. The Betches received multiple comments in regard to the post. One reader came forward saying that her friend had not eaten in two weeks since reading the post. Despite reader's backlash on the topic of anorexia, the Betches have still discussed the topic on their platforms. A website named Digital America, claims that \\"betches are proud to be the girls that everyone hates because they view it as a reflection of their superiority\\". Digital America also explains that betches strive to dominate the social structures set forth today through their use of beauty, wealth, popularity, and their lack of compassion for others.

He speaks of a certain Muhammad al-Masmudi, who lived there with his wife and servant. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Libyan F-5s were deployed to Sargodha Airbase, perhaps as a potential training unit to prepare Pakistani pilots. Gaddafi personally directed a strongly worded letter to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, an ally of the Bangladeshi Mukti Bahini, accusing her of aggression against Pakistan. Modern relations Bangladesh has a resident ambassador in Libya. Libya has a resident embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In October 2011 the government of Bangladesh recognized the Libyan National Transitional Council. Bangladesh embassy was attacked in Tripoli on February 2017. In May 2020, 26 Bangladeshi migrants were murdered by human traffickers in the Mizdah massacre. Economic relations Since 1974 Libya has been recruiting migrant workers from Bangladesh. Bangladesh signed an agreement to send 1 million workers to Libya in 2009. On May 2015 Libya banned migrant workers from Bangladesh over concerns that they were illegally migrating to Europe through Libya. There was an estimated 37 thousand strong Bangladeshi community in Libya as of September 2015. By April 2017 the number had fallen to 20 thousand. In May 2017 Bangladesh became the single largest source of migrants to Europe through Libya. Khalifa Haftar of Libya's National Army banned the arrival of Bangladeshis and 5 other nationals in 2017.

Production The show was conceived when Buscemi met Gino Orlando, his sidekick on the series, while directing promotional shorts for Vampire Weekend. \\"When we saw the footage,\\" Buscemi said, \\"Geo was so natural and just a great sidekick, if you will, that I said to my producing partner and our producing team, 'I think I can build a whole show out of Geo and I on park benches.'\\" His brother Michael Buscemi appears as a rival talk show host.

Additionally, the EPOC effect can be utilized in a reverse manner in order to influence the selectivity of versatile heterogeneous catalytic reactions. In most cases, the electronically conductive catalyst is in metallic or metal oxide states in the form of a porous film deposited on a solid electrolyte (O2‚àí or mixed O2‚àí electronic conductor). The EPOC effect was firstly discovered by M. Stoukides and C. Vayenas in the early 1980s and have been widely studied by various research groups for more than 100 heterogeneous catalytic reactions of mostly gaseous molecules. The EPOC effect has been evaluated as an important phenomenon which can closely link electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.  Examples and research fields  The EPOC effect can be observed in a wide range of catalytic reactions with several kinds of metal or metal oxide catalysts mostly coupled with solid electrolytes. Versatile catalytic reactions including hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, oxidations, reductions, isomerizations, and chemical decompositions have been known to be promoted electrochemically on various transition metal and oxide catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ag, Au, Ni, Cu, Fe, IrO2, RuO2) deposited on O2‚àí (YSZ), Na+ or K+, H+, F-, aqueous, CeO2 conductors, and molten salts. The main focus and purpose of numerous studies regarding the EPOC effect have been reported so far can be classified as follows: 1) the elucidation of examples for the EPOC effects on specific catalytic reactions with environmental or industrial interest (ex. NOx reduction and hydrocarbons oxidations), 2) the mechanistic investigation of the origin of the EPOC effects (mainly focusing on the system with oxygen- ion conducting electrolytes), 3) the large-scale application and commercialization of the chemical reactions promoted by the EPOC effects along with development of novel compact monolithic reactors and 4) the utilization and incorporation of the EPOC effect in high or low-temperature fuel cell systems.  Mechanistic origins  Earlier mechanistic proposals for the EPOC phenomenon with solid electrolytes mainly emphasized tuning of the local work function of the surface of conductive catalysts by spilled-over species, which are in-situ generated during electrochemical polarization processes. It has been proposed that the spilled-over species can subsequently modulate the chemisorption strength between surface adsorbates (intermediates) and catalyst binding sites, thereby influencing the rate or selectivity of the target reactions significantly. Particularly in the case of oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte systems, for instance, the migrated anionic O species from the solid electrolyte to the metal-gas interface has been suggested as the origin of the corresponding EPOC effects along with the evidence that the migrated charged species on the surface can be identified via in-situ spectroscopic methods. On the other hand, the hypothesis of modification of the local work function to explain the origin of EPOC was recently criticized with a different view that heterogeneous catalysis needs to be explained by more recent concepts such as d-band center theory, rather than the surface work function, which might play a more trivial role in understanding of surface reactions.  Aqueous electrolyte solution at ambient temperatures  In contrast to solid electrolyte systems under high temperatures (usually higher than 200 ¬∞C), EPOC has rarely been reported in low-temperature aqueous systems (particularly at room temperature). Only a few examples have been demonstrated for the EPOC in an aqueous electrolyte solution at ambient temperature: H2 oxidation at Pt catalyst surface in alkaline solutions, hydrocarbon isomerization reaction occurring at the nanoparticulate Pt catalyst, hydrazine oxidation operating at the Ni alloy catalyst in alkaline media, and CO2 reduction at the Pd-based gas diffusion electrode. Even though the perturbation of the local work function and tuning of surface binding strengths of intermediate species were suggested as the origin for the EPOC effects in the liquid electrolyte systems as similar to the EPOC examples of high-temperature solid electrolyte systems, thorough theoretical studies supported by clear experimental evidence have not been addressed. Very recently, it was additionally hypothesized for the cases of the hydrazine oxidation and the CO2 reduction that the mechanistic origin of the EPOC phenomena observed in these cases can be contributed to structurally non- disparate transition states and/or surface bound intermediate species for the corresponding bifurcated faradaic and non-faradaic reactions.

Flowering plants have a rosette of bright green leaves at the base of the flowering stem and a single green and white flower with the tip of the dorsal sepal pointing above the horizontal. Description Pterostylis furcata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Flowering plants have a rosette of bright green leaves loosely arranged around the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long and wide. A single green and white flower long and wide is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column but the dorsal sepal is longer than the petals, has a sharp point on its end and points slightly upwards. There is a wide gap between the lateral sepals and the galea, and there is a curved, deeply notched sinus between them. The labellum is long, about wide, dark-coloured, curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis furcata was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley from a specimen collected in Tasmania and the description was published in The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants.

Personal life Vitold John Manikoff, commonly known as John Manikoff, was born on September 19, 1951, in Pontiac, Michigan. He was the son of Vitold John Manikoff and Jane Holt. John graduated from Lahser High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in 1969 and attended Oakland Community College for a brief period. He then received an associate degree from Glendale Community College in Glendale, California. In 1999, he received a degree in graphic design from the School of Graphic Design at Platt College near Los Angeles, California. As a musician, John traveled extensively throughout the United States, but his summers were frequently spent on Mackinac Island, Michigan, at a cabin built by his great-grandparents in 1902. Prior to his death, he resided in Nassau, Florida. John Manikoff died of cancer at the Woodland Hospice House in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, on January 21, 2011, and was cremated. Music career John Manikoff was both a songwriter and a musical performer. He began his music career at an early age, having learned to play the piano at the age of 5. He initially performed his songs locally in Michigan and then traveled around the United States and Canada performing his music, eventually ending up in Los Angeles, California. John played piano with the Bad Boys, a rock group that included drummer Michael Clarke of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He was also a founding member of and pianist for the band Catsey in Boulder, Colorado. In addition, John opened for several musicians, including Bob Seger, Etta James, Richie Havens, Alice Cooper, and Joe Cocker. John contributed as a performer to several music albums. He was a backing vocalist on an album by Buddy Greco, Ready for Your Love (1984). He played piano on two albums by punk rock musician Jeff Dahl: (Ultra Under [1991] and Wicked [1992]). He also played piano on an album by Amy Lamotta, Playing Dead/Look at Me (1992), which was produced by Amy Lamotta and Jeff Dahl. In partnership with Timothy Duckworth, John Manikoff composed and performed the song \\"Prince of the City,\\" which was included on the soundtrack for the 1987 movie Morgan Stewart's Coming Home. The movie featured Jon Cryer as Morgan Stewart, Lynn Redgrave as his mother, Nancy Stewart, and Nicholas Pryor as his father, Tom Stewart. The song was played as Morgan drove through the streets of Washington, D.C. John also composed the music for the song \\"Tell the Night,\\" which was included on an album by Peggy March, Always and Forever (2012). In 2010, he recorded an album of his songs titled John Manikoff's Album. This collection of 13 songs includes what is perhaps his signature composition, \\"Take Me to Mackinac Island.\\" The album is currently available from several Internet streaming music services. According to his LinkedIn entry, John Manikoff was the owner, president, producer, staff writer, professional artist, and graphic designer at Rockmanikoff Music in Lansing, Michigan. He was also a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Fine arts career Although he was primarily known as a musician, John Manikoff was also involved in the graphic and fine arts. He frequently supported himself by working as a freelance graphic designer and art director, having received formal training in graphic arts. In 2003, he took a hiatus from his music and returned to Michigan to focus on oil painting. The summer scenery of Mackinac Island formed the primary subject matter, and many of his paintings featured views of the island from the family's cabin at British Landing. John also painted portraits. He frequently donated his paintings to local fund-raising events. John Manikoff provided illustrations for two short books for children that were written by his sister, Caroline Sheppard. The first book, published in 1998, was Brave Bart, which was intended for children who were traumatized and/or grieving. The second book, published in 2003, was Shadow Moves, which was meant for children and their families who were involved in a difficult move.

Constructed in stages between 1893 and 1902, the main part of the building was designed by local architect James Gilbert Chandler.  History  Dr. Clarendon Shoop, a practicing physician in Racine, began selling his own patent medicines in 1890. The Shoop Family Medicine Company's business outgrew its rented room on Main Street quickly, and finding no sufficiently large spaces available, Shoop had plans drawn up for a five-story building.\\"What's in a name: Shoop building and Shoop Park\\", Racine Journal Times, May 5, 1998. This building was designed by local architect James G. Chandler in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The first parts of the building, the basement, and lower two stories were constructed in 1893. For cost reasons, Shoop decided not to build the upper stories until space was needed. The building was thus finished in 1899, becoming the tallest building in Racine.\\"Reportorial Notes in and out the city\\", Racine Daily Journal, May 12 and August 4, 1899. Two major additions were made in 1902: a six-story annex along the south side; and a two-story office and powerhouse in the Renaissance Classical style, also designed by Chandler, to the east side. With After the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, which regulated the claims made by pharmacists like Shoop, the company was forced to cut back production.

In 1996 he was awarded the Forbes Prize \\"for outstanding work in the field of conservation\\" by the International Institute for Conservation, and gave the attendant Forbes Lecture that year in Copenhagen. He retired in 2002 and was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire the same year.  Early life  William Andrew Oddy was born on 6 January 1942 in Bradford and spent his childhood in the nearby township of Baildon. He was the first son of William Tingle Oddy, then serving in the Auxiliary Fire Service for the duration of World War II, and Hilda Florence Oddy (n√©e Dalby). He attended Sandal Primary School in Baildon and Bradford Grammar School. It was during these years that he developed an interest in archaeology after having visited the excavations at Meare Lake Village in Somerset that were being directed by Harold St George Gray. When in the sixth form he went with parties from Bradford Grammar School on several occasions to excavate in York under the direction of George Willmot of the Yorkshire Museum. He also took an interest in stonemason's marks on mediaeval buildings and this led to his first publications, which were in the Archaeology Group Bulletin published by Bradford City Art Gallery and Museums. In the summer of 1960, Oddy participated in the King Hussein Youth Camp in Jordan. Two weeks were spent visiting religious and archaeological sites.  University  In October 1961, Oddy went to New College, Oxford to read chemistry. He was awarded a BA at the end of year three in 1964 and a BSc following the submission of a dissertation in 1965. An MA followed in 1969 and a DSc in 1993. He became a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and a Freeman of the City of London in 1986.  Career  On graduating in 1965, Oddy joined the Research Department of the Agricultural Division of Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham in County Durham as a junior research scientist but resigned September 1966 to take up a post as a scientific officer at the Research Laboratory in the British Museum. His role was to research methods and materials for the conservation of antiquities and during this period projects included cleaning the Elgin Marbles, cleaning limestone sculptures, and preserving waterlogged wood. In 1968, he was given the role of overseeing the conservation and scientific examination of the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship burial, excavated in 1939. He was promoted to Senior Scientific Officer in June 1969 and Principal Scientific Officer in December 1974. In 1975, as a result of a re-organisation within the British Museum, Oddy was given the management of metallurgy, x-ray diffraction and radiography and became responsible for coordinating the British Museum's forensic examination of objects submitted for acquisition. During this period research projects included the manufacture of gold wire in antiquity, the assaying of gold in antiquity, the analysis of gold coins using the Archimedes method, and the composition of niello inlay in antiquity. Oddy was appointed Head of Conservation in 1981 and then elevated to Keeper of Conservation in 1985. In later years, his research focused on the history and philosophy of conservation. He retired on his 60th birthday in 2002.  Research projects  = Marble sculpture = In the early 1960s, the British Museum began an extensive programme of cleaning its collection of classical marble sculptures by the application of a solvent to remove atmospheric grease and a mud-pack to suck out dirt from the porous surface. The mud-pack consisted of a natural clay-like material called sepiolite, and the procedure was known as the Sepiolite Method. By 1966 much of the reserve collection of marbles had been cleaned and only the Elgin Marbles remained. These were, however, a sensitive issue because of a scandal in the late 1930s when craftsmen had over- enthusiastically scraped at natural deposits on some of the surfaces with copper tools. In 1966, Oddy and a senior conservator, Hannah Lane, did some initial cleaning which showed that the sepiolite method did not adversely affect the marble but did leave the surface looking rather milky in appearance. It was thus decided to apply a very dilute solution of a water- soluble polyethylene glycol wax. = Waterlogged wood = In the autumn of 1970, dredging operations in a drainage channel on the Graveney marshes on the north coast of Kent revealed the remains of a small ship, the wood of which was completely waterlogged. The National Maritime Museum decided to recover and conserve the remains of this early medieval boat and asked the Research Laboratory of the British Museum for assistance.Oddy, W A, The Graveney Boat - Problems of Conservation, in Three Major Ancient Boat Finds in Britain, National Maritime Museum, London, 1972, pp.19‚Äì24 This led to a programme of research into the conservation of waterlogged wood.Oddy, A, Wet Wood: Techniques Employed in the Conservation of waterlogged Wood, Yachting World 125 (1973) 119‚Äì120 The result was that the method chosen was the replacement of the water inside the wood with a water-soluble polyethylene glycol wax by soaking in tanks of the wax for many months. Tanks were built at the National Maritime Museum to conserve the boat.Oddy, W A, Blackshaw, S and Gregson, C, Conservation of the Waterlogged Wooden Hull, in The Graveney Boat: A Tenth Century Find from Kent (ed. V Fenwick), National Maritime Museum, London, 1978, pp.321‚Äì330 = Corrosion of museum objects = In 1972, the Wallace Collection sought the help of the British Museum Research Laboratory to investigate the tarnishing of gold snuff boxes after they had been on display for only a few months. Tarnish in the form of silver sulphide was spreading from the settings of precious stones. Testing of the materials of which the showcase were made revealed that the main structural timber was an African pseudo-mahogany and that this caused silver to tarnish very quickly. Fresh samples of this timber were inert and it was assumed that the timber of the showcase had been treated with a chemical either as a fire retardant or insect repellent. The method of testing materials to be used in the construction of storage units or display cases for metal objects eventually became standardised and known as the Oddy Test. It is widely used in museums around the world. = The Sutton Hoo Anglo-Saxon ship burial = In progress. = Forensic examination of antiquities = From 1981, when he was appointed as Head of Conservation, Oddy had little time for research. However, his interest in history and biography led him to study the origins of 'modern' conservation in the UK and, especially, in the British Museum.Oddy, W A, The History and Prospects for the Conservation of Metals in Europe, in Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on the Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, Tokyo National Research Institute of Cultural Properties, Tokyo, 1993 pp.1‚Äì26 His own hero was Harold Plenderleith, the first keeper of the Research Laboratory. In 2001, Oddy and Sandra Smith organised a 'swansong' conference at the British Museum on the history of conservation worldwide. In 2005, Oddy participated in a European Union-funded project on the history of conservation organised by the Associazione Giovanni Secco Suardo. He wrote three contributions on the history of conservation in the UK.  Publications  Oddy has contributed numerous obituaries to the national press and to various journals, newsletters, magazines and online sites.

(Stalin's White Sea - Baltic Kanal: History of Construction 1931 - 1934)) is a 1934 Soviet historical volume detailing the construction of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal and the labor used to construct it. The volume was edited and compiled by Maxim Gorky and contributed to by various other Soviet writers. In 1935, the work was translated from Russian into English and subsequently published in England as The White Sea Canal and in the United States as Belomor: An Account of the Construction of the Great Canal Between the White Sea and the Baltic Sea. The original version of the work consists of thirty-five chapters covering both the history of the canal's construction and personal narratives of the inmates who lived and worked in the labor camps. Together, these accounts were intended to show the power and ability of the state in reforming landscape and people according to its goals.  History  In August 1933, the publishing house History of Factories and Industrial Enterprises editorial board decided to commission a book on the construction of the White Sea ‚Äì Baltic Sea Canal. Under the guidance and control of the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU), the publishing house assembled a ‚ÄúWriters' Brigade‚Äù of 120 writers from across the Soviet Union who met in Moscow on August 17, 1933 for a pre-trip orientation where the head of the Belomor prison camp provided background information on the project. Maxim Gorky, though not a participant in the August orientation or tour of the construction site, was chosen as the head editor and leader of the writers' brigade. Members of the Writers' Brigade touring the White Sea Canal, 1933 Sailing from Leningrad, the writers began their weeklong tour toured the Canal zone later that month. Along the way, the writers were intended to have meetings with the ‚Äúcanalarmyists‚Äù (Russian: Kanaloarmeitsy from kanal, canal, and armeets, one who is part of the army) where they could interview the inmates and gain direct insight into the reformative aspects of the labor camp. However, most of the writers‚Äô meetings were staged or tightly monitored and their observations were mostly done from afar. When writers did meet inmates, they were generally common criminals rather than political prisoners, who would have provided more critical views of the canal's labor methods. An additional limitation in the writers‚Äô method of collecting information presented itself in the interviews with engineers which were performed through questionnaires delivered weeks to months after the trip itself rather than in person. In September, the writers organized a plan for the writing of the book and divided the work amongst themselves. Throughout October, the authors met and discussed the manuscript and potential edits to it. A series of ‚ÄúAuthors‚Äô Notes‚Äù were created as readers read each other's draft manuscripts of chapters and recorded their comments and reactions. These comments ranged from general chapter summaries and reactions to specific revisions and suggestions for particular phrasings. In November, the manuscript began to be illustrated by a group of artists working under A. Tikhonov. In December the manuscript was passed to the printers and on January 20, 1934, the book was published in Russia, in time for the Seventeenth Party Congress. An English translation of the work was prepared in Moscow and proofed by May O‚ÄôCallaghan before being published in England and the United States in 1935.  Content  The original Russian version of the text was divided into fifteen chapters. In addition to these chapters, the volume includes a bibliography of works consulted and used during the creation of the text. These include government decrees, State Political Directorate (GPU) orders, camp bulletins and newspapers, and archival materials. The volumes also included maps of the canal and the greater waterway, which highlighted the Soviet's ability to transform and reshape landscapes. Of the fifteen chapters, thirteen were written collectively while three are attributed to a single author. The chapters touch on a variety of topics from the longer history of efforts to connect the Baltic Sea and White Sea, to construction methods, to the long-term impact of the project. However, most sections relate the personal histories of camp laborers and emphasize the role of physical labor in reforming them from criminals to productive members of society. Although The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal was written after the completion of the canal's construction, references to the physical labor on the canal are frequently made in the future tense. This serves to locate the project in a distinct, imaginary temporal realm that was unconstrained by time limitations. Indeed, the new understanding of time extended to the ‚Äùfive in four‚Äù slogan which proudly emphasized that projects within Stalin's Five-Year plan could be completed in four years.  Process  The various authors of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal attempted to write from a universal rather individual point-of-view. The thirty-four authors ‚Äúhelped one another, corrected one another‚Äù and, because of the collaborative nature of their method, ‚Äúit is difficult to indicate just who wrote the various sections.‚Äù The volume attracted attention from those that were curious about the process of group composition and how a group of such authors might go about choosing a subject to which that method was suitable. Beyond offering symbolic reinforcement of collective efforts, group composition offered elements of collective responsibility and collective protection to the creation of narratives. The method of group composition also resembled the technique of montage, which was widely popular during this period in Soviet photography and film. In montage, disparate elements are joined to create a unified whole such that individual qualities are secondary to a single idea. In The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal, collective labor by disparate writers came together to create a work advancing the message of reforging Soviet society. Gorky emphasized the importance of writers knowing and experiencing the Soviet Union's development prior to writing about it. Following that method, the authors of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal visited the canal zone to experience the reality of its construction. Although the reality they saw was manipulated, once on the site they could gather the raw materials related to the industrialization project and use that first-hand knowledge to document and create a history. Within that history, Gorky placed greater emphasis on the social and cultural consequences of the canal project rather than its economic motivation. Thus, the volume highlights the personal narratives of prison inmates and tracks the pedagogical elements of the labor camps. Controversy The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal was written as an official history of the canal project and attempted to document both the project history and personal histories of the workers building it. Because it was written with the intention of being an official record, the government officials guiding the writers‚Äô research excursion meticulously planned and controlled the trip, placing limits on writers‚Äô access to inmates and sources. Because of this, the book has often been criticized for its propagandist nature and for not revealing the reality of the forced labor project. For example, despite the many similarities in harsh labor conditions and high fatality rates during the Canal construction and a Tsarist-era boat conduit project, The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal presents the Canal construction a supposedly modern, humane approach to earlier project, though both were colloquially referred to as ‚Äúroad of bones.\\" This criticism has alternatively been placed on those who organized the excursion and project, for creating half-truths that were accepted by the writers as evidence of the positive aspects of the construction, and on the writers themselves, who have been condemned for compromising the truth in exchange for benefits to their own careers or personal connections. Legacy The Russian publication of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal occurred in three printings. The first run of 4,000 copies in January 1934 was intended for the delegates of the Seventeenth Party Congress which was meeting that month. That Congress dictated the timeline of the project and was the reason it was pushed forward so quickly. The second run of 80,000 copies was printed soon after the first and the final run of 30,000 copies was printed in 1935. These printings were intended for the masses rather than the party elite that received the first run. In 1935, The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal was translated into English, although the translation did not match the Russian original in either its organization of chapters and sections or the progression of its narrative. The English translation tended to emphasize the content of the text rather than the overarching structure and ideology behind it. Indeed, both the British and American titles of the translated work fail to emphasize Stalin's name in the official name of the canal. Although the individual translators are never credited, they were likely Soviets working with the intention of creating a version of the narrative that would be palatable to English- speaking readers. The very existence of an English translation emphasizes the importance of the construction project within Russia and its desire to highlight the achievement to audiences abroad. At the time of its original publication, reviewers wrote favorable assessments of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal. Both the project's documentation of a period of restructuring and the collective nature of the volume garnered reviewers praise. Criticism initially focused on a lack of detail about the technical aspects behind the canal's construction or on the inability to capture the topic within a single volume, where many more works would be necessary to do it justice. During the purges of 1937, the majority of OGPU personnel who were involved in the White Sea Canal construction, including Genrikh Yagoda, the head of the OGPU, were imprisoned or executed. At the same time, many copies of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal volume were destroyed although copies in private libraries were sometimes spared. Copies that remained bore physical depictions of the purges of the persons named within them when their names were scribbled out. The once publicly emphasized and celebrated construction project began to slip from public memory as its history was relegated and removed. In The Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn describes the book as 'disgraceful' and 'the first in Russian literature to glorify slave labor.' Authors Notably, not all of the volume's final authors were part of the writers' brigade tour of the canal zone and, conversely, not all of the writers in the brigade went on to contribute to the volume.

She served as editor of the literature department of William Henry Harrison Murray's The Golden Rule (1875‚Äì78). For 10 years, she was the New York literary and dramatic correspondent for The Hartford Times. For 25 years, she was worked as a travel and general correspondent to the press. The best work of her life, which she valued beyond the novels, was published in an illustrated volume entitled As It is to Be. A bibliophile, Daniels collected a library of a 1,000 volumes, which she kept packed away in boxes. She was a member of the American Folklore Society, and the Theosophical Society. Daniels was a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Early years and education left Cora Linn Morrison was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, March 17, 1852, the daughter of Abram B. Morrison and Mary Elizabeth Pond Morrison. She is descended from the Morrisons, hereditary judges in the Hebrides Islands since 1613, on her father's side. The family motto being translated, reads: \\"Longheadedness is better than riches.\\" She is descended from the Ponds, on her mother's side, upon whom a coat-of-arms with the motto, \\"Fide et Amore,\\" was conferred by Henry VIII, in 1509. Her grandfather, General Lucas Pond, was for many years a member of the Massachusetts Senate. Her great-uncle, Enoch Pond, D.D., was president of the Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine. She had at least one sibling, a brother, Abraham Cressy Morrison. She was educated in the grammar school of Malden, Massachusetts. A private tutor took charge of her for two years. She was sent to Delacove Institute, near Philadelphia, and finished her studies in Dean Academy (now Dean College), Franklin, Massachusetts. Career Her literary life began with a poem published in the Independent in 1874. When William Henry Harrison Murray conceived the idea of publishing The Golden Rule, in Boston, he invited her to contribute a series of articles descriptive of prominent racehorses. She did so under the pen name \\"Australia\\". The articles were attributed to Mr. Murray himself and were so successful that they immediately led to an engagement, and she became literary editor, remaining on the staff three years. She also contributed much poetry to the paper under the pen name \\"Lucrece,\\" but afterwards signed her own name, both to prose and poetry. Her clever poetry in Judge and other weeklies of the day was widely copied and is even translated into the French. Her poems were widely copied and sometimes translated into other languages, returning to this country by being re-translated for Littell's Living Age. Becoming New York correspondent for the Hartford Daily Times, her letters appeared regularly therein for 10 years, touching upon every possible subject, but more particularly devoted to dramatic criticism, art and reviews of notable books. It was at the Hartford Daily Times that she made her first hit with a series of bright, sparkling letters on life and manners in the Bermudas. Among the reviews was a notice of Elihu Vedder's The philosophy of Omar Khayyam, the astronomer poet of Persia, which was reproduced in a pamphlet, which, being sent to Rome, was pronounced by Vedder the most comprehensive and excellent review that had been produced. Constantly contributing to a number of publications, her first novel, Sardia (Boston, 1891), was successful. The bronze Buddha: A mystery (University Press, 1899) was dedicated to her brother, Abraham. As it is to be (1892) As it is to be The best work of her life, which she valued beyond any possible novel, was a work treating of what might be designated \\"The Science of the Hereafter\\", or \\"The Philosophy of After Death\\", which was published in an illustrated volume entitled As It is to Be (Press of King, Fowle & Co., 1892). It was reviewed by Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly who stated that it \\"is a singularly imaginative little book, by Mrs. Cora Linn Daniels, whose essay in romance, entitled Sardia (Lee and Shepard, 1891), attracted some attention a year or two since. Mrs. Daniels builds up an ingenious scheme of universal revelation, based upon individual psychological intimations‚Äîor, as she chooses to call them, 'the message of the Voices'. It is at times difficult to follow her logic, and impossible to keep up with it, so to speak; yet there is an enthusiasm about her writing which wins upon the sympathy if it does not conquer the conviction. There are abundant testimonials to this effect from men of eminence and authority. Professor Elliott Coues, for instance, writes: \\"If you commune with an extraneous spirit you have a wise, strong and good counselor. If you commune with your own higher spirit you must accept the very highest compliment from me.\\" Personal life On July 10, 1871, at the age of 19, she married Joseph H. Daniels, of Franklin, a member of one of the historic families of the neighborhood. Her travels in the U.S. have been extensive. She spent 20 winters in New York City, varied by trips to Washington, D.C., Bermuda and the West. Despite travel and the life of cities, her existence has been one of mental solitude. She has never found companionship of thought and labor. She has collected a library of a 1,000 volumes during 20 years, but they have been packed in boxes for 17 out of the 20. What she has done has been done alone, without books at hand, and usual incentives to new thought gained through literary intercourse. Her most-prized literary possession is a volume of more than three hundred letters from distinguished people all over the world, full of thanks and compliments for reviews and notes of themselves or their works. These attest to the quiet life of high thinking and the constant energy in working. Daniels was a member of the American Folklore Society, and an original member of the Theosophical Society. She was a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.

Consider a cylindrical duct with axis along z direction with radius a through which fuel is fed from the bottom and the tube mouth is located at z=0. Oxidizer is fed along the same axis, but in the concentric tube of radius b outside the fuel tube. Let the mass fraction in the fuel tube be Y_{Fo} and the mass fraction of the oxygen in the outside duct be Y_{Oo}. Fuel and oxygen mixing occurs in the region z>0. The following assumptions were made in the analysis: * The average velocity is parallel to axis (z direction) of the ducts, \\\\mathbf{v}= v \\\\mathbf{e}_z *The mass flux in the axial direction is constant, \\\\rho v=\\\\mathrm{constant} *Axial diffusion is negligible compared to the transverse/radial diffusion * The flame occurs infinitely fast (Burke‚ÄìSchumann limit), therefore flame appears as a reaction sheet across which properties of flow changes * Effects of gravity has been neglected Consider a one-step irreversible Arrhenius law, \\\\mathrm{Fuel}+s\\\\mathrm{O}_2\\\\rightarrow (1+s)\\\\mathrm{Products}+q, where s is the mass of oxygen required to burn unit mass of fuel and q is the amount of heat released per unit mass of fuel burned. If \\\\omega is the number of moles of fuel burned per unit volume per unit time and introducing the non-dimensional fuel and mass fraction and the Stoichiometry parameter, :y_F = \\\\frac{Y_F}{Y_{Fo}},\\\\quad y_O = \\\\frac{Y_O}{Y_{Oo}},\\\\quad S = \\\\frac{sY_{Fo}}{Y_{Oo}} the governing equations for fuel and oxidizer mass fraction reduce to :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\rho D_T}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left(r\\\\frac{\\\\partial y_F}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) - \\\\rho v\\\\frac{\\\\partial y_F}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{Y_{Fo}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\rho D_T}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left(r\\\\frac{\\\\partial y_O}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) - \\\\rho v\\\\frac{\\\\partial y_O}{\\\\partial z} = S\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{Y_{Fo}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where Lewis number of both species is assumed to be unity and \\\\rho D_T is assumed to be constant, where D_T is the thermal diffusivity. The boundary conditions for the problem are :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{at}\\\\, &z;=0,\\\\, 0 The equation can be linearly combined to eliminate the non-linear reaction term \\\\omega/Y_{Fo} and solve for the new variable :Z = \\\\frac{Sy_F-y_O+1}{S+1}, where Z is known as the mixture fraction. The mixture fraction takes the value of unity in the fuel stream and zero in the oxidizer stream and it is a scalar field which is not affected by the reaction. The equation satisfied by Z is :\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left(r\\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\rho v}{\\\\rho D_T}\\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial z}=0. Introducing the following coordinate transformation :\\\\xi = \\\\frac{r}{b}, \\\\quad \\\\eta = \\\\frac{\\\\rho D_T}{\\\\rho v} \\\\frac{z}{b^2}, \\\\quad c= \\\\frac{a}{b} reduces the equation to :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi}\\\\left(\\\\xi\\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial \\\\xi}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial \\\\eta}=0. The corresponding boundary conditions become :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{at}\\\\, &\\\\eta=0,\\\\, 0<\\\\xi The equation can be solved by separation of variables :Z(\\\\xi,\\\\eta) = c^2 + 2c \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_n} \\\\frac{J_1(c\\\\lambda_n)}{J_0^2(\\\\lambda_n)} J_0(\\\\lambda_n \\\\xi)e^{-\\\\lambda_n^2\\\\eta} where J_0 and J_1 are the Bessel function of the first kind and \\\\lambda_n is the nth root of J_1(\\\\lambda)=0. Solution can also be obtained for the planar ducts instead of the axisymmetric ducts discussed here. Flame shape and height In the Burke-Schumann limit, the flame is considered as a thin reaction sheet outside which both fuel and oxygen cannot exist together, i.e., y_Fy_O=0. The reaction sheet itself is located by the stoichiometric surface where Sy_F=y_O, in other words, where :Z=Z_s \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{S+1} where Z_s is the stoichiometric mixture fraction. The reaction sheet separates fuel and oxidizer region. The inner structure of the reaction sheet is described by Li√±√°n's equation. On the fuel side of the reaction sheet (Z>Z_s) :y_F = \\\\frac{Z-Z_s}{1-Z_s},\\\\, y_O=0 and on the oxidizer side (Z) :y_F=0,\\\\, y_O = 1-\\\\frac{Z}{Z_s}. For given values of Z_s (or, S) and c, the flame shape is given by the condition Z(\\\\xi,\\\\eta)=Z_s, i.e., :Z_s=c^2 + 2c \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_n} \\\\frac{J_1(c\\\\lambda_n)}{J_0^2(\\\\lambda_n)} J_0(\\\\lambda_n \\\\xi)e^{-\\\\lambda_n^2\\\\eta}. When Z_s\\\\rightarrow 0 (S\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty), the flame extends from the mouth of the inner tube and attaches itself to the outer tube at a certain height (under-ventilated case) and when Z_s\\\\rightarrow 1 (S\\\\rightarrow 0), the flame starts from the mouth of the inner tube and joins at the axis at some height away from the mouth (over- ventilated case). In general, the flame height is obtained by solving for \\\\eta in the above equation after setting \\\\xi=1 for the under-ventilated case and \\\\xi=0 for the over-ventilated case. Since flame heights are generally large for the exponential terms in the series to be negligible, as a first approximation flame height can be estimated by keeping only the first term of the series. This approximation predicts flame heights for both cases as follows :\\\\begin{align} \\\\eta &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1^2}\\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\frac{2c J_1(c\\\\lambda_1)}{(Z_s-c^2)\\\\lambda_1 J_0(\\\\lambda_1)}\\\\right],\\\\quad \\\\text{under- ventilated} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1^2}\\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\frac{2c J_1(c\\\\lambda_1)}{(Z_s-c^2)\\\\lambda_1 J_0^2(\\\\lambda_1)}\\\\right],\\\\quad \\\\text{over- ventilated}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\lambda_1=3.8317.

Anya offers to buy some, but Guanghui rejects her help. Xiaohu ask Zhen to give up her dream of being an actress but she refuse. Anya and Deping brings words that there is a fire at a restaurant in which Guanghui works. The three friends race to the scene but are prevented from the police from going too close. They are anxious, but have no choice but to leave. Deping gives Grandma a scare, when he thoughtlessly says something has happened to Guanghui. Guanghui arrives home with porcupine dates. Grandma is relieved and cry tears of joy. Guanghui lies about his escapade as is still early .It was the day of his exam and it was early, Guanghui was going out for a while but Then holds tightly to him and drops a bad with bottles of smuggled wine. Everyone is dumbfounded but Guanghui says he does it to buy porcupine dates for Grandma. They are late for the exam. Xiangrong was one of the judges plead with the other judges of giving them a chance. The results are released, everyone was accepted except Zhen, Anya runs into Jiang Longhai when she reports for work. She then realise she was selected in place of Zhen. Zhen was infuriated. Episode 3 - Deping cannot believe Anya was accepted instead of the prettier Zhen. Guanghui points to the relationship Anya's father, Guodong, has with Xinghai, the head of Chinese drama unit. Guanghui offers to give his place up to Zhen. She turns him down; she feels he is a born actor. Xiaohu asks the director for a substitute for Xiangrong when he notices she is unwell. At the director's insistence, however, Xiangrong attempts to execute the wire-suspension stunt herself. Zhen volunteers to replace Xiangrong. Suspended in mid-air, she grits her teeth in fear to finish the scene. Later, she tells Xiangrong she is content to just be a stand-in. The four friends have a day out together. Deping scoffs at Anya, but they make up when he returns to help her with her sprained ankle. Guanghui and Zhen see Xiaohu and Xiangrong talking in undertones, after which Xiaohu seems agitated. They part ways. Suspicious, Zhen and Guanghui secretly tail him and see him and a fully disguised Xiangrong enter a hotel. Episode 4 - Zhen and Guanghui think Xiaohu and Xiangrong are in the hotel for a tryst. They dash into the hotel room, to find another middle-aged woman with them. Bluntly, Zhen asks Xiangrong if she is her mother. Xiaohu rebukes her for her wild imagination. Xiangrong makes up an excuse. As Zhen fires her questions persistently, Xiaohu leaves hurriedly. Anya and Zhen are constantly bullied by a director. Deping and Guanghui defend the girls and get themselves into trouble with the director. Incensed, the director abuses his power by asking Guanghui to shoot a bath scene in the nude. Guanghui passes the editing room while on his way to see the director, and several cameramen are laughing at his nude bath scene. A scuffle ensues. Xinghai is unable to find the nude bath scene in the editing room. Guanghui scolds him for showing favouritism and leaves angrily. Xinghai hopes Guanghui will put his heart into acting, but Guanghui does not heed anyone's advice. Zhen is hurt while being a stand-in. Anxious, Xiangrong asks after her. Zhen pesters Xiangrong again about her parentage. Episode 5 - With Zhen intensely probing, Xiangrong has no choice but to reveal the background. Zhen's mother is He Xinyu, Xiangrong's good friend. Twenty years ago, Xinyu left for Hong Kong to build her career. Xinyu fell in love with Xiaohu and gave birth to Zhen. Now, Xinyu is down and out, but her whereabouts are unknown. Intrigued, Zhen asks Xiaohu what happened. She stops asking when she senses he is upset. Guanghui's bad attitude irks the director. Xinghai issues him a warning, but Guanghui argues and tells Xinghai he has no right to lecture him since his partiality for a certain colleague is evident. Not long after, Guanghui learns Xinghai has fired the director. Deping finds out about the love triangle between Zhen, Guanghui and Anya. Guanghui thinks it is an April Fools‚Äô Day prank when Deping tells him Zhen likes him. Embarrassed, Zhen gets into an argument with Deping. Guanghui is late for work. Xinghai scolds him. In a fit of anger, Guanghui resigns. Xinghai makes him finish a scene before he leaves. Ironically, for the first time, Guanghui finds joy in his work. Xinghai shows Guanghui the scene he had completed and asks him to reconsider his resignation. Episode 6 - Time flies. The kampong is requisitioned by the government. Zhen and the others are forced to move out. Anya and Guodong move into a house. Guanghui and Zhen are neighbours again. Roped in as a substitute, Zhen does a scene with Deping. She is bruised by him. He blames her for being slow and refuses to admit his mistake. Incensed, Guanghui chases him out of the house. Deping has nowhere to stay and decides to sleep in the artistes‚Äô rest room. He bumps into a girl in white, which scares the wits out of him. The next day, Guodong tells him the \\"ghost\\" is named Qian-gu. Deping falls ill and faints. Deping wakes up to find Zhen looking after him. He confesses his feelings for her, which terrifies her. Xinghai realises Zhen has potential as an actress. He decides to give her a part in a drama. However, she takes her role too seriously and irks the director. Anya comforts her and shares that she envies her for landing a role with dialogue. They encourage each other to fulfil their dreams. Anya is shocked to find out she has been cheated of the $1,000 she paid to a talent agency. Episode 7 - Anya complains to her friends about the talent agency. Guanghui comes up with a plan to lure the swindler out. Zhen watches other actors filming a scene and halts the proceedings when the actor does not perform well. The director is incensed, and complains to Xinghai. Xinghai tells Zhen her intensity scares all the directors and no one dares to give her a role. She is disheartened. Deping lures the swindler, Alan, out. Anya recognises him. With two thugs, Alan taunts Deping to pay him, and threatens to disfigure Anya. Deping gets into a fight with the thugs, with Guanghui and Zhen helping him. The police arrive and arrest Alan and his men. Anya asks Guodong to help her become a lead actress. He tells her to get the TV producer, Jason, drunk, take him to a hotel, and accuse him of taking advantage of her. Jason will then relent and give her a plum role. An unexpected turn of events sees Jason giving the lead role to Deping instead. Guodong comes up with another idea: He decides to let Anya go overseas to seek acting opportunities. Episode 8 - Xinghai and Xiangrong are judges of the preliminary round of Star Search. They are surprised to see Zhen as one of the contestants. When Xinghai voices his dislike for Zhen's acting style, she is crushed. She feels she has lost her last chance to make it big and becomes uncertain of her future, as all she knows is acting. Xiangrong recommends she fill up a vacancy in the costumes department. Zhen goes looking for Guanghui on the set to share the news with him. She finds him sleeping in a corner. As she watches him, she blurts out her feelings for him on impulse and musters up the courage to kiss him. He wakes up suddenly. Guanghui, who's the lead, films a scene with Deping. Deping fumes when the director scolds him for changing his lines, while praising Guanghui for doing the same. Deping laments that the person who is popular can do whatever he wants. Zhen encourages him to prove himself. He hugs her gratefully. Zhen is undecided whether to confess her love for Guanghui. Grandma encourages her to fight for her happiness. Deping finds out and tries to hinder Zhen from meeting Guanghui. Episode 9 - Zhen is angry with Deping for ruining her declaration of love. He advises her to give up, as Anya is the person Guanghui likes. Zhen is heartbroken. Because of her advancing age, Xiangrong is edged out of the limelight and forced to take supporting roles. Although she pretends to be open-minded, she is bothered by this. Infuriated with Guanghui for not joining them for dinner, Deping orders many spicy dishes, not knowing Grandma does not take well to spicy food. She doesn‚Äôt want to offend Deping and forces herself to eat. That night, she develops diarrhoea. When told that Deping had forced Grandma to eat spicy food, Guanghui flies into a rage and chases him out of the house. Deping moves into Zhen's house. She chases him out when she hears he had helped Anya to spy on her and Guanghui and prevented them from being together. Anya undergoes a complete makeover. She takes on the lead role in a new drama and is paired with Guanghui as a couple. Zhen rushes to the film set to inform Guanghui that Grandma is missing. She witnesses him kissing Anya and is devastated. Episode 10 - Everyone is panicky over Grandma's disappearance. It turns out that she was bringing a cake to the TV station to celebrate Guanghui's birthday. He is moved, and promises to be filial. Disturbed by Guanghui's aloofness towards Deping, Zhen helps them to reconcile. Zhen is fired from her job. To make matters worse for her, Guanghui and Anya get closer. Zhen begs Xiaohu to let her be a stunt double. He refuses. With Anya's help, Zhen gets to work at Guodong's food stall at the TV station. Anya and Guanghui become the newly acclaimed on-screen couple. Deping is getting bigger roles for his portrayal of villains. Only Zhen remains off-screen. She now is a dish cleaner at the TV station canteen. Guanghui finally accepts Anya when she professes her love for him. Zhen is heart-broken to see them kissing. By chance, Zhen is invited to work in the makeup department. With makeup on, she looks entirely different. A rising actor, Liwei, tries to hit on her. Guanghui returns home to find his birth mother, Bixia, waiting for him. Episode 11 - Zhen learns the reason why Bixia abandoned Guanghui many years ago and sympathises with her. She decides to help them reconcile. Xiaohu is shocked to see a female stranger using the washroom early in the morning. Bixia shares her plight, and he decides to lend a hand as well. Guanghui and Anya find it thrilling to date secretly. Anya asks Zhen to help them cover up their romance, as she is afraid their relationship will affect their careers. Guanghui agrees, and Zhen relents. Bixia seeks Guanghui's forgiveness but to no avail. She confides in Xiaohu, and cries in his arms. Xiaohu's plan backfires and Bixia almost loses her life. Fortunately, Guanghui and Zhen arrive in time to save her. Although Guanghui is concerned about Bixia, he is unable to let go of his bitterness. She decides to leave. Zhen tells Guanghui off. He discovers Bixia gone, having left a birthday gift he had given her years ago. He decides to look for her. Episode 12 - The loansharks confront Bixia. Xiaohu tries to negotiate with them but to no avail. Guanghui offers to settle the debt. Guodong takes Anya to see Eric, the head of a movie company. He mentions that Eric has invested in many foreign movies, and if Anya maintains a good relationship with him, she might have the opportunity to act in a Hollywood production. He wants her to break up with Guanghui; she refuses. Bixia asks Zhen if she likes Guanghui. Encouraging her to pursue her happiness, Bixia reasons that the best way is to ruin Guanghui and Anya's relationship. Anya goes on a date with Guanghui. She instructs Zhen to inform her if she spots any reporters. Zhen notices a reporter lingering around. A moment of selfishness prevents her from alerting Anya and Guanghui, and they are photographed. Guanghui gives the loansharks $10,000. Soon after, Bixia meets with the loansharks and they split the money. Xiaohu chances upon the scene and is taken aback. Episode 13 - When Xiaohu appears, Bixia signals the loansharks to play along with her. They comply and slap her. After the loansharks leave, Bixia pretends to show affection for Xiaohu so he would not doubt her. Liwei expresses his feelings for Zhen. She feels flattered as it is the first time anyone has ever declared romantic love. Deping warns Liwei not to lead her on. Anya is unable to meet Guanghui privately for a period of time. Wanting to surprise him, however, she goes to the karaoke lounge he is at. He is so drunk that he does not recognise her, and she is annoyed.

He was known as \\"the wealthiest man\\" in Massachusetts and was buried in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lorenzo Sabine said of him, \\"A man of more eminent talents, and of greater eccentricities, has seldom lived.\\" Early life William Brattle was born on April 18, 1706 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Reverend William Brattle of the First Parish in Cambridge, a member of Royal Society, and a Harvard graduate (1680), educator, and leader. Brattle's father was also a slave owner, , as were many New England ministers, both Puritan and Anglican See for example, the names of servants in the King's Chapel Burial Records, including those for its priests; see also the named servants of individuals like Rev. Samuel Parris, in Danvers. His mother was Elizabeth Hayman Brattle; she died July 28, 1715. He had an older brother, Thomas, who died as a young child. He was the nephew of Thomas Brattle and the last only descendant in the male line of Captain Thomas Brattle, his grandfather. His father died in 1717, and without a means of support, Brattle began attending Harvard, during which time he was both fined for violating college rules and was head of the class. In 1722, he graduated from Harvard. His classmates included Richard Saltonstall of the Saltonstall family and William Ellery. He continued his studies for a graduate degree, and was head of the masters class of 1725. When he was 21 years of age, Brattle inherited the estates of his father and uncle Thomas. Author James Henry Stark said \\"He inherited a large and well invested property, and had ample means to cultivate those tastes to which, by his nature and education, he was inclined.\\" Career He preached sermons in the early 1720s, but by 1725 decided that he did not want to continue to pursue the ministry and began to practice medicine, providing treatment over his years in Cambridge to residents and students. He had a private law practice and for many years was an overseer of Harvard. In 1728, at age 22, William Brattle attained the rank of Major. p. 404 In 1729, he became a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. He was a captain or the major of the First Regiment of Militia in the County of Middlesex in 1733 when he wrote Sudnry rules and directions for drawing up a regiment, posting the officers. Beginning about 1729, he served 21 terms as selectman of Cambridge. He became a member of the House of Assembly of Massachusetts Bay in 1736. He then was the attorney general of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. = French and Indian Wars = Brattle served in two French and Indian Wars. By 1745, during King Georges War, Brattle was appointed commander of the forces at Castle William.A Revolution in Color: The World of John Singleton Copley By Jane Kamensky He served in the French and Indian War, joining the governor's council in 1755. He was active in raising troops and with the general administration of military affairs in the Province. During the war he became Adjutant-general in 1758 and Brigadier-general in 1760. = American Revolution = Friendly with the Sons of Liberty, in 1769 he supported the revolutionary cause, but two years later he became major-general of the Militia of Great Britain in Massachusetts, American patriots called him a \\"fence straddler\\" for \\"simultaneously appeasing patriots while supporting the British.\\" A Loyalist, he had notified the Royal government when people began to prepare for the Revolutionary War by storing arms. In 1772, he had a significant public dispute with John Adams. Brattle wrote a letter in the autumn of 1774 to the Royal Governor of Massachusetts Bay, Thomas Gage, stating that members of the local militia were building up arms and that he feared that they were going to steal the store of gunpowder from the Charlestown Powder house. The letter was lost on its way to Gage and was found and published in a Boston newspaper. Gage had the powder barrels removed from Charlestown by 300 troops, which was seen as a means of provocation and resulted in the gathering of 4,000 people at the Cambridge Common. This incident, called the Powder Alarm, made the Tories who lived in Cambridge to feel uneasy. Brattle moved to Boston and remained on Castle Island through the siege of Boston. In the meantime, his house and other abandoned properties of the Tories were occupied by patriots. His house became the headquarters of Thomas Mifflin, the Commissary General. Regular visitors included George Washington, John Adams and Abigail Adams. John Adams said of Brattle becoming a Loyalist: :‚ÄúBrattle was a divine, a lawyer, and a physician, and however superficial in each character, had acquired great popularity by his zeal, and, I must say, by his indecorous and indiscreet ostentation of it, against the measures of the British government. The two subtle spirit, Hutchinson and Sewall, saw his character, as well as Trowbridge who had been his rival at the bar for many years. Sewall was the chosen spirit to convert Brattle. Sewall became all at once intimate with Brattle . Brattle was soon converted and was announced a Brigadier General in the militia. From this moment the tories pronounced Brattle a convert, and the whigs an apostate. This rank in the militia, in the time of peace, was an innovation, and it was instantly perceive to have been invented to take the gudgeon.‚Äùp.210 After the 1774 incident known as the Powder Alarm, an angry mob surrounded the Brattle mansion and forced the family to flee to Boston. At age 70, Brattle left Boston for Halifax, Nova Scotia on Evacuation Day, March 17, 1776, and died a few months later on October 26, 1776.A sermon preach'd after the funerals of the Reverend Mr. Brattle and the Reverend Mr. Pemberton by Benjamin Colman He was buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia).

The Boston Gazette wrote: :‚ÄúNorwich, May 13, (1776), We hear that the Rev. General Brattle, Attorney at Law and Doctor of Physic, went from Boston to Halifax in character of Commissary, Cook. It seems in the hurry and timidity of the flight, this complication of excellencies, notwithstanding his eminent services, particularly in feeing the rabbits and singing that beautiful elegy to their memory, was entirely forgotten and had not birth provided for him, although he was allowed to eave a singular talent at running away.‚Äù His children were allowed to keep his property in Cambridge, but his Boston and Oakham property was confiscated by the province of Massachusetts. Brattle also owned property in Halifax and southeastern Vermont.

Biography  Lansburgh was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and studied economics at the University of Pennsylvania. There in 1915 he obtained his Bsc in economics, and in 1916 his MA, and in 1918 his PhD in Political Economy with a thesis entitled \\"Labor turnover.\\"Fourteenth List of Doctoral Dissertations in Political Economy in Progress in American Universities and Colleges. Published June 1, 1917. p. 495. In 1915 Lansburgh had started his life-long academic career at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, only interrupted by World War I. From 1917 to 1919 he served in the Ordnance Corps of the United States Army. He started out as First Lieutenant, and got promoted to the rank of Captain and of Major. Back at the Wharton School he was assistant professor from 1919 to 1921, and Professor of Industry until his retirement in the late 1930s. Furthermore Lansburgh served as director of the Pennsylvania Economy League of Southwestern Pennsylvania; as Secretary at the Labor and Industry Commonwealth of Pennsylvania since his appointment by Gifford Pinchot in 1924; as Industrial Officer; at the First National Bank of Detroit, management consultant and management author.  Work  Lansburgh is particularly known for his seminal work in industrial engineering, particularly with the publication of his 1923 book Industrial Management. The text is designed not to make any original contribution, but to create an overview of the field. In the introduction to the 3rd edition he explained the work as: :\\"... A conscious effort has been made to present what appears to the authors to be a sound philosophy of management, which may be summarized as a balanced relationship between the equities of the consumer, labor, owners of capital, management, and organized society or government. Any deviation from this approach has been a question of interpretation, not intent.\\"Lansburgh (1942, iv) The work itself consists of seven parts.  Reception  The author of Yardsticks of Management (1946) remembered Lansburgh for his outstanding opinion about those matters.Yardsticks of Management: A Company Performance Measurement Handbook for Top Management, Administrative, Financial, Sales and Production; an Operation Tool in the Application of the Principles of Scientific Management in Industry. Management Book Company, 1948 Lansburgh in 1930 had argued: :\\"Is there a definite policy for the maintenance of the skill and good-will of the workers? Fine! But we must be much more definite. I went in a plant two weeks ago and got a new figure for maximum labor turnover. This company had been turning its entire working force over 100 per-cent each month for a period of a year. They had a 1200 per-cent turnover per annum, and some folks were wondering why they had not been more successful. That, or the conditions which caused it, is much more deeply rooted than an attempt to maintain the good-will of the workers. For one thing, that company probably holds the world's record for rate-cutting. I asked the general superintendent if they ever changed rates and got this reply: \\"Oh, yes, we are changing rates all the time. Whenever a man gets more than we think he should, we cut his rate.\\" He told me that as though it would demonstrate to me how good he was. All these very fundamental things are the things you have to know. Of course, good-will will spring out of these fundamentals, and I assume that was implied. I am just trying to show you the things I feel you have to know in detail if you are going to establish any sort of a balance sheet of management...\\"Taylor Society (1930), Bulletin of the Taylor Society.

Lovecraft and racism in the United States during the era of Jim Crow laws, as experienced by Black science-fiction fan Atticus Turner and his family. It was published by HarperCollins.  Characters  The major characters include: * Atticus Turner, a Black man, former soldier in the Korean war. * Montrose Freeman, Atticus' father. * George Berry, Atticus' uncle (husband of Hippolyta). * Hippolyta Berry, Atticus' aunt (wife of George). * Letitia Dandridge, a neighborhood friend of Atticus' growing up in Chicago. * Ruby Dandridge, Letitia's sister. * Samuel Braithwhite, a white man, lodgemaster at Ardham sorcerers' coven. * Caleb Braithwhite, Samuel's son.  Plot  The book consists of eight interconnected stories: = Lovecraft Country = Atticus Turner, working in Florida after leaving the army, returns home to Chicago after receiving a mysterious letter (of sorts) from his estranged father, Montrose, saying he had left Chicago to go to Ardham, Massachusetts, where he believed he could find some information on Atticus' mother's family (previously unknown to them). Atticus, his uncle George, and his childhood friend Letitia drive to Ardham to find Montrose. They are chased, accosted, and later nearly murdered by racists on the way. Once at Ardham they find a large manor house called Ardham Lodge. Atticus learns that he is the descendant of the Lodge's founder, Titus Braithwhite. Montrose is being held hostage, chained up in a basement. The current owner of the house, Samuel Braithwhite, is planning a ceremony with all of the members of his lodge (a sect of sorcerers called \\"The Order of the Ancient Dawn\\") during which he needs a Braithwhite descendant to be a conduit for some ancient power. Presumably this will kill Atticus. Caleb Braithwhite (Samuel's only son) is also in attendance and he secretly instructs Atticus with an incantation to say during the ceremony. Atticus does this and it causes the unleashed power to consume Samuel and all the members of the lodge and turn them into dust while protecting Atticus. Caleb releases Atticus, George, Montrose and Letitia and lets them leave to go back to Chicago. = Dreams of the Witch House = Letitia receives an inheritance (of sorts) from her late father, a notorious gambler, and uses it to buy, in a white neighborhood, a large 14-bedroom house called the Winthrop House (named after the original owner, Hiram Winthrop) which was being sold cheap due to it being haunted. Letitia plans on fixing it up and renting out the rooms. After moving in, she realizes that the house is haunted by Winthrop's ghost who is not too happy about sharing it with new residents. He and Letitia struggle and he nearly kills her until she convinces him that if he does she will stay as a ghost and haunt him back. After that, they come to an agreement and even find some peace over their shared love of playing games like chess, Letitia never seeing Winthrop but his pieces moving on their own. Meanwhile the white folks in the neighborhood quickly begin harassing Letitia because they don't want black people living there, swearing at her, vandalizing the car of one of her friends, threatening her, and throwing manure at her front door. One night, three young men break in with intentions to burn the house down. Winthrop's ghost intervenes, and hauls the men down to the basement where they are locked in terror until the police arrive. Later Atticus discovers that Caleb Braithwhite arranged for the sale of the house to Letitia. = Abdullah's Book = Caleb Braithwhite blackmails George and Montrose to break into the natural history museum and retrieve a secret book, hidden behind magical incantations set to protect it. They bring along a couple members of the Prince Hall Freemasons (a lodge George and Montrose belong to) for help: Abdullah Muhammad and Pirate Joe, the lodgemaster. Abdullah nearly dies in the attempt, but the men are able to retrieve the book. Caleb honors his deal with the men. It's the \\"Book of Names\\", once owned by Hiram Winthrop. He delivers to them the book he stole from them along with a sizable amount of money. = Hippolyta Disturbs the Universe = Hippolyta finds a secret compartment in one of the rooms in the Winthrop House containing a book and a key. The book gives an address for an observatory in Warlock Hill, Wisconsin. Hippolyta, having a life long passion for astronomy, decides to take a trip out there to see it. She finds the observatory and is able to get in with the key. Once inside, she discovers it contains no telescope, just a control console containing 64 windows each displaying a 3-digit number, and a button. She soon discovers that by changing the numbers in the windows and pushing the button, a scene is projected inside the observatory from random places in the universe. There is a doorframe on the other side of the observatory which she suspects would let her walk out into that random place. The book she found included 64 3-digit numbers, so she dials those in and pushes the button. It displays a white sandy beach. Hippolyta goes through the door frame onto the beach and discovers a house a distance off. Investigating, she is captured by a woman named Ida. Ida explains that she and several others had been taken there nearly 20 years ago by Hiram Winthrop, furious with them that his son had run off with one of the maids, and he was going to keep all of them there until they told him where his son was. To show them he was serious, he left them there and said he would come back in a few days. He never returned. (The implication is he died suddenly before he could return, perhaps at the hands of Samuel Braithwhite, with whom he had a contentious relationship.) Ida destroys the book with the 64 digit location written in it, and she eventually lets Hippolyta leave, but makes her promise to destroy the key, claiming she wants to stay and be left alone. Hippolyta does leave, but she does not destroy the key. = Jekyll In Hyde Park = Ruby (Letitia's sister) is approached by Caleb Braithwaite with a proposal. He needs someone to do odd jobs for him and also keep an eye on The Winthrop House. In return, he will give her a potion that will turn her into a beautiful red-haired white woman for a period of time. Ruby tries this and discovers it is real. She explores parts of Chicago as a white woman with freedom she never would have had as a black woman. She agrees to work for Caleb in this fashion. One of the jobs he has her do is attend a meeting of representatives of different sorcerer lodges from around the country, in disguise as the red-head (who Ruby has named Hillary). There Caleb proposes to each lodge that they join forces, form a sort of union between them, to share knowledge and help each other. When asked who would lead this union, he suggests that they all meet back in Chicago in a few months on Midsummer's Day for a contest. Whoever has the strongest alchemy to display to the others, gets the title of their leader. Later Ruby discovers that the potion is being made from the blood of a woman in a coma who Caleb keeps nearly frozen in a glass coffin in his basement. Ruby says she wants nothing more to do with him, but cannot bring herself to leave. The story ends with Caleb asking her to be sure of what she wants. = The Narrow House = Caleb Braithwaite asks Atticus and Montrose to find Henry Winthrop, the son of Hiram Winthrop. Henry took some of his father's books when he ran away, including his notebooks, and Caleb wants them. Atticus and Montrose embark on a journey to Aken, Illinois, where Henry is rumored to be. However, they soon find that since Henry ran off with a black woman who used to work at his father's house, they were both killed by a racist mob. At their house, Montrose meets the ghosts of Henry and his wife's family, who relive the last day of their lives every day (including the murder). Montrose finds Hiram's books, but decides to tell Caleb they found nothing there. = Horace and the Devil Doll = Cousin Horace makes an appearance in this chapter, after being approached by two detectives and Captain Lancaster. A comic book he drew was found near Hiram Winthrop's observatory, and they demand that Horace ask his mother Hippolyta about it and report back to them. Horace refuses to cooperate, so Lancaster casts a spell to prevent Horace from telling others about the situation, and to cause inanimate objects to move. Soon enough, Horace begins to notice all kinds of cartoons and photographs grinning at him, and a doll attacks him. Horace manages to use Scrabble tiles to spell out to Ruby what happened, and Ruby tells Caleb. Caleb reverses the curses, believing Lancaster thought Caleb ordered Hippolyta to snoop around the observatory. He thinks that Lancaster tried to kill Horace to punish Hippolyta for working with Caleb. Caleb devises a plan to kill Captain Lancaster. = The Mark Of Cain = Everyone gets together to share their stories about Caleb. Caleb has a plan to get rid of Lancaster, but the family decides that they need to get rid of both of them. They decide to pretend to go along with Caleb's plan, but ask Winthrop's ghost for help. Caleb lures Lancaster into a room where a monster swallows him whole, then Atticus uses magic to alter Caleb's Mark of Cain. The mark prevents Caleb from entering certain places and from doing magic. They toss him into their truck, drop him off in Indiana, and drive away. Reception Publishers Weekly commended Ruff for his \\"impressive grasp of classic horror themes\\", and noted that the book's \\"most unsettling\\" aspect is the constant bigotry experienced by the characters, while Kirkus Reviews considered it a \\"series of bizarre chimerical adventures\\" and a \\"merrily macabre pastiche\\", comparing it favorably to Ruff's previous works. At Boing Boing, Cory Doctorow described the characters as \\"active protagonists [with] lives, ... dignity, and ... indomitable spirit\\", and observed that because of their constant experiences with \\"harassment, violence, expropriation, and the legacy of slavery\\", they \\"don't need Elder Gods to experience horror\\", while at Tor.com, Alex Brown judged that the book \\"thoroughly and effectively marries race and horror\\" and called it \\"a tense thriller, a terrifying nightmare, a heartbreaking tragedy, and a tale of holding onto aspiration and optimism even while being chased through the woods by a hellbeast from another dimension\\". Adaptation In 2020, HBO released an adaptation of the novel by showrunner, writer and executive producer Misha Green. Jordan Peele and J. J. Abrams also serve as executive producers.

He was a prominent member of the Mouvement National Congolais in Stanleyville and a close partner of Patrice Lumumba. However, in October 1960 he denounced Lumumba and was shortly thereafter imprisoned by pro-Lumumba authorities. He was executed in February 1961 in retaliation for the deaths of several pro-Lumumba politicians.  Biography  Alphonse Songolo was born in 1927 in the Belgian Congo as a member of the Lokele ethnic group. He received his education at the Fr√®res Maristes de Kisangani et de Buta, graduating in 1946. Afterwards he worked in the colonial administration, including service as secretary for the governor of Orientale Province. In April 1953 Songolo became assistant secretary of the Stanleyville chapter of the Association du Personnel Indigene de la Colonie, a labour union. In 1959 he was elected as mayor of the commune of Kabondo in Boma. He also became president of the local chapter of the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), serving in the position into the following year. In December he was arrested for his political activities. In 1960 he was elected as a representative from Orientale Province as a member of the MNC to serve in the Chamber of Deputies of the newly independent Republic of the Congo (L√©opoldville) with 2,593 preferential votes. Patrice Lumumba, leader of the MNC and long-time associate of Songolo, became prime minister. He included Songolo in his government as Minister of Communications. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June 1960. On 5 September, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba and appointed Joseph Il√©o to replace him. Il√©o chose to keep Songolo in his government. On 14 September Colonel Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu launched a coup and established his own government. Songolo subsequently declared his support for the new authority. On 3 October Songolo, in spite of previously having a close working relationship with the deposed prime minister, led a group of MNC parliamentarians in denouncing Lumumba. At a press conference he derided both Lumumba and the MNC, saying that the party should be renamed the \\"Mouvement National Communiste\\". On 17 October Songolo and a number of like-minded deputies returned to Stanleyville and were immediately arrested by local authorities sympathetic to Lumumba. There were rumors that Songolo was poorly treated in custody, but a United Nations commission later found no visible evidence to substantiate the allegations. However, on the morning of 20 February 1961 Songolo and 14 other political prisoners were shot in Stanleyville after news broke that the central government had allowed for the execution of several pro-Lumumba politicians in South Kasai.

A tropical depression developed on September 13 and the next day attained tropical storm status, upon which it was named Abby. Continuing to intensify, Abby moved west-northwest and became a typhoon on September 16\\\\. Two days later, the typhoon attained maximum intensity. On September 19, the typhoon made landfall in Taiwan as it turned towards the northwest. Rapid weakening occurred due to land interaction, and on September 20, Typhoon Abby transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Its extratropical remnants were last noted on September 24 as they raced off to the northeast. The typhoon claimed 13 lives in Taiwan. Around 2 million people lost power due to the storm while greater than 20 houses were destroyed. Over 59,895 ha (148,000 acres) of crops were damaged. Monetary damage totaled $81 million. In addition to effects on Taiwan, the extratropical remnants later brought heavy rains to Japan. Meteorological history During late August and early September 1986, the Western Pacific monsoon trough became displaced to the east. Lower than normal pressures favored the building of convection over the trough. By the evening of September 9, a pronounced area of disturbed weather developed southwest of the Truk Atoll. Aided by low wind shear, the disturbance developed slowly, even though the Hurricane Hunters initially failed to find a well-defined center. The disturbance drifted towards the northwest, and early on September 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Based on ship reports, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on September 13. Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Abby at 00:00 UTC on September 14. On September 14, Abby, while moving west-northwest, began to develop a central dense overcast and thus began to intensify. On the morning of September 15, the JMA upgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. Despite reports from Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicating that low-and upper-level circulations were not properly aligned, both the JTWC and JMA estimated that Abby became a typhoon early on September 16. At 06:00 UTC on September 18, the JMA reported that Abby attained its maximum intensity of . Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that Abby reached its peak intensity of . Moving northwest, the storm weakened slightly before making landfall in the eastern portion of Taiwan on September 19; the JTWC estimated winds of at the time of landfall. Due to land interaction, the storm rapidly weakened, with the low-level center re-curving towards the northeast. At 00:00 UTC on September 20, the JMA estimated that Abby weakened below typhoon intensity. Twelve hours later, the JTWC stopped monitoring the system while located southeast of Shanghai. Around this time, the JMA reported that Abby transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the JMA continued to track the system through the morning hours of September 24. Preparations and impact As a result of the typhoon, travel to the Mid-Autumn Festival dropped by 20%. As a precaution, flights to Taiwan's two main airports, the Chiang Kai-shek Airport in suburban Taipei and Kaohsiung International Airport in the southern portion of the country, were diverted elsewhere, but the airports re-opened 12 hours after the cyclone passed. Even though the storm weakened slightly prior to landfall, some areas of the country received of rain, after already having suffered severe damage from Typhoon Wayne a week earlier. In southern Taiwan, about 100 people were trapped in floodwaters after the typhoon damaged dikes. Thirteen people perished due to the typhoon and three others were injured. A 4-year-old girl and her 2-year-old brother died after she tried to light a candle in response to power outages caused by the typhoon. Two men drowned in floods while one man was killed when his motorcycle struck an electric pylon. Falling trees crushed four other victims. In addition to the fatalities, one man was listed as missing after his automobile fell from a bridge into a river in Taipei. Approximately 2 million people lost power due to the storm, while more than 200 houses were destroyed. Over of crops were damaged. Damage totaled $81 million, but overall was less than expected. The remnants of the storm brought showers and strong winds to parts of Japan. A precipitation maximum occurred in Yakushima, where of rain fell. Within a 24-hour time span, Tano received the highest rainfall, with a total of . A peak wind gust of was measured on Yonaguni Island.

It is a tree weta that belongs to the order Orthoptera, which was described by Frederick Hutton in 1896. The word \\"weta\\" is originally from the MƒÅori language, where it can be used as singular and plural.  Identification  The Banks Peninsula tree weta is a red-brown colour (Biodiversity Recovery Unit, 1998) its body length can range from 40‚Äì55 mm in mature adults and it weighs 4‚Äì6 g. Like other insects Banks Peninsula tree weta has three body segments, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Hemideina ricta and Hemideina femorata both live in forest fragments on Banks Peninsula. These two species can be differentiated using the number of stridulatory ridges on their abdomen. Hemideina ricta has more than 20 ridges in total (left + right side of body) where as H. femorata has fewer than 16 stridulatory ridges. Although these two species will share the same daytime refuge holes only a few F1 hybrids have been found, and no gene flow has been detected between the two species. The head of the mature male Banks Peninsula tree weta is much larger and darker than that of females or juvenile males with large mandibles that they use to fight other males. The two eyes are situated on the front of its head with two antennae protruding from the inside margin of these. The antennae can be much longer than the body length, and these are covered with hairs which are able to sense activity. Banks Peninsula tree weta also has three ocelli, or simple eyes, between its eyes which respond to changes in light. The thorax contains the front, middle and hind legs of the weta, each leg is made up of six segments; the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus and the pretarsus. The ear of the weta can be found at the top of the tibia near the knee joint of the front legs. The tibia of the hind legs are covered in spines, that can be rubbed against the stridulatory ridges on the side of the body to produce a sound, these can also be used as a defence mechanism against predators. Banks Peninsula tree weta can be distinguished from other types of weta as they have 20 or more stridulatory ridges. The hind legs are also very muscular for the purpose of jumping, however the Banks Peninsula tree weta is too heavy to jump. The abdomen is broken up into segments, called spiracles, and it is here we find the stridulatory ridges. Protruding from the abdomen is the cerci, which is used to pick up vibrations in the air. Females also have an ovipositor, a long tube like cylinder used to deposit eggs in the soil.  Geographic distribution and habitat  = Global range = The Banks Peninsula tree weta is native and endemic to New Zealand. Related species can be found in Australia, where they are known as king crickets, New Caledonia, Chile, Madagascar and South Africa. = New Zealand range = The Banks Peninsula tree weta is found only on the east side of the Banks Peninsula. Its range is limited to a roughly 200 km¬≤ area between Pigeon Bay and Akaroa Harbour. = Habitat preference = Due to the clearance of forest and shrubland on Banks Peninsula to make way for farming (Biodiversity Recovery Unit, 1998) Banks Peninsula tree weta spends a lot of its time living on the ground , it can often be found living on wooden posts, in crevices in rocks or in fallen tree logs. Where available the Banks Peninsula tree weta prefers to live in cavities of trees but where these are in short supply it makes do with its surroundings. When occupying trees Banks Peninsula tree weta is most often found in lacebark and kanuka trees however it has also been known to occupy broadleaf, mahoe and five finger amongst other species. When choosing a tree cavity to live in the Banks Peninsula tree weta prefers cavities that have a small opening, so that mammalian predators are unable to enter, and a large space inside. Tree weta generally do not dig their own cavities, they occupy ones previously made by the larvae of other insects. There can be several weta living in a single cavity at any one time, often a single male with several females. A male chooses and modifies a cavity so that the opening is just wide enough for its head to fit through. The Banks Peninsula tree weta is generally found at elevations above 400 metres and can be found at elevations of up to 800 metres.  Life cycle  In captivity mating has been reported during the months of April, May and November. Mating generally occurs within cavities at night, as this is where large groups of females gather to seek out shelter. Adult males fight over ownership of cavities and therefore the females within those cavities, males with larger mandible gapes often come out on top in these battles. After mating the female needs to leave the safety of the tree cavity in order to descend to the ground to lay her eggs. Oviposition, the process of egg laying, typically takes place at night. The female first examines the ground before laying her eggs by placing her ovipositor into it, she then moves on to a nearby patch of land and repeats this process laying more eggs. This procedure takes around 10‚Äì15 minutes. The eggs are around 5.9 mm in length, weigh around 16.8 mg and are black, brown or white in color. The eggs can take several months to mature , generally hatching during spring. When eggs hatch they often do not do so all at once, a single batch of eggs may take up to two weeks to all hatch. A female weta can lay up to 200 eggs in her lifetime. It can take up to two years for juvenile weta to mature and reach adulthood, during this time the young weta must moult several times as it grows. It does this by anchoring itself to a tree branch using its hind legs and hanging upside down. The thorax is the first part of the body to emerge, followed by the abdomen, then the head, next the front and hind legs are pulled out and the antennae emerge last. The Banks Peninsula tree weta goes into a period of inactivity for a few days before moulting and lightens in colour. After moulting the weta consumes its exuviae, the shed skin, as this is made up of valuable proteins. Adults live for several months and in some cases up to a year.  Diet, prey, and predators  = Diet and foraging = The Banks peninsula tree weta in an omnivore that feeds off of trees, shrubs, and in some cases pasture species. They are nocturnal and only come out at night to eat leaves and small insects. Due to their nocturnal nature they are preyed on by vertebrate predators such as rats. = Predators, parasites and diseases = The main mammalian predators for Hemiedina ricta are rodents, specifically rats and possums, which are pests throughout mainland New Zealand and some offshore islands. Native diurnal birds such as kaka, weka and nocturnal birds such as kiwis and owls prey on weta as they are included in their food source. Other less common predators include tuatara and short-tailed bats. Weta in some cases can be pest ridden with mites that will attach to the membranes of their joints.

It is 31.9 km long. It connects Caoba station on the Kunming‚ÄìHekou railway with Guanjiashan railway station, a dead-end station in Datun Town of Gejiu City. It also serves as the connector between the Kunming‚ÄìHekou railway and the Mengzi‚ÄìBaoxiu railway. The Caoguan railway is located entirely within the administrative borders of the cities of Mengzi and Gejiu. History When the Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong railway (opened 1910) was constructed, it did not directly serve the valley where the city of Mengzi is located. The railway was routed east of the city, for a more efficient Hekou to Kunming route. To serve the local administrative center, Mengzi, and the tin mines of Gejiu, in 1915‚Äì1921 the local business interests constructed the Bisezhai‚ÄìGejiu railway (part of the future Gebishi railway). A line, it connected with the Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong mainline at Bisezhai railway station, east of Mengzi. The Caoba‚ÄìGuanjiashan branch was constructed by the PRC Ministry of Metallurgy to server Yunnan Tin's Datun mining area (Â§ßÂ±ØÁüøÂå∫). The first section of this branch, the 11.3 km segment from Caoba (on the Kunming‚ÄìHekou mainline) to Yuguopu railway station (Èõ®ËøáÈì∫Á´ô) on the Gebishi railway was constructed in 1958. Yuguopu station became the new transhipment point between the 600 mm Gebishi railway and the metre- gauge network. In 1965, in connection with the expansion of the Yuguopu station and the construction of the Datun Phosphate Fertilizer Plant (Â§ßÂ±ØÁ£∑ËÇ•ÂéÇ), the line was extended by 1.86 km to Guanshengzhuang (ÂÖ≥Âú£Â∫Ñ). In 1966-1969, the 18.2 km section from Guanshengzhuang to Guanjiashan station was constructed. The control of the Caoba‚ÄìYuguopu section was transferred from the Ministry of Metallurgy to the Kunming Railway Bureau in 1960; in 1970, the Yuguopu‚ÄìGuanjiashan section was transferred to the Kunming Railway Bureau as well. After part of the Gebishi railway (the Mengzi‚ÄìYuguopu‚ÄìJijie‚ÄìShiping line, later known as the Mengzi‚ÄìBaoxiu railway) was regauged to the 1,000 mm gauge in 1970, Yuguopu station ceased to be a transhipment point, becoming a simple junction point between the Caoguan and Gebishi lines. In 2013, the standard-gauge Yuxi‚ÄìMengzi railway reached Mengzi City; the new standard gauge Mengzi North railway station was constructed next to Yuguopu station. A connection between the two stations was set up, providing for transhipment of freight between metre-gauge and standard-gauge trains. Thus the Caoguan- Yuguopo section of the Caoguan line became a connector between Yunnan's century old metre-gauge Kunming‚ÄìHekou line and the new standard-gauge Kunming‚ÄìYuxi‚ÄìHekou railway.

Fish species present in the lake are bluegill, rock bass, tiger muskie, carp, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, yellow perch, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and brown bullhead. There is a hard surface launch ramp off East Lake Road. Cossayuna Lake is located in the towns of Argyle and Greenwich, in southern Washington County, near the eastern border of New York. Cossayuna has come to be known as a community or neighborhood which includes not only the lake and the village at the south end, but also the highland back of the west shore known as Dutchtown and the highland back of the east shore known as Bunker Hill. Also included are the road to South Argyle as far as the South Church, south on Sand street to the Robertson farm and the high long hill rising abruptly from the south end of the lake. This hill was called Stewart Hill in the early days, named for the ancestor of the merchant family of that name, and now known, on its north side as Ramsey Hill, on its south side as Ramsey Hill, and on its west end as Rock Hill. The name Cossayuna is a corruption of Quabbauna, the Native American name for the lake. Tradition says that this name means \\"The Lake of the Three Pines\\", for the three enormous pines which grew on the Oaks point. Native American tradition also notes that the region was the home of the Horican tribe of Indians. The Horicons were kinsmen of the Mohicans and the Hoosacs, but had completely disappeared before Europeans came to America. Tradition, handed down from the time the St. Ange Frenchmen visited the Hoosick Valley before 1600, tells of a much-used fishing and hunting trail. The trail led from the Tiashoke corn and pumpkin field of the local inhabitants, near Eagle Bridge, up the Owl Kill, through the present village of Cambridge to the Jackson ponds and over the hill and up the Cossayuna Creek to the lake. The hills were covered with a dense primeval forest in which large pines predominated. The Argyle Patent In 1764 Archibald Campbell of Raritan, N.J., and Christopher Yates of Schenectady, N.Y., came to the area to survey the Argyle Patent. The Argyle Patent included the present town of Argyle, the present village of Fort Edward, and that part of the town of Greenwich lying east of a north and south line passing through a point a short distance east of the Center Falls school house. This Patent was granted by the Province of New York to a large group of Scottish Highlanders who came to America about 1740 from the Hebrides island of Islay. The interested reader is referred to ‚ÄúA History of The Argyle Patent‚Äù published by the Washington County Historical Society. The First Settlers The first settlers came in 1765. They included Alexander McNaughton, Cornelius McEachron and his brother Peter, and Duncan McArthur. None of the original patentees settled in the Cossayuna area except John McEachron who joined his brothers after the Revolutionary War. There were very few other new settlers until after the war. The frontier location, the threat of invasion from the north, and the difficulties in obtaining land titles from the widely scattered patentee owners, discouraged prospective settlers. After the Revolution there was a steady trickle of new settlers. By 1790, they were coming in considerable numbers and by 1812 some start had been made in clearing and settlement of all the lots of the Patent. The original houses had been log cabins with dirt floors and field stone mud- plastered chimneys. Soon after 1800, these had been replaced with frame dwellings. The new settlers were principally of English ancestry from New England with a sprinkling of Scots-Irish. A considerable number were Palatine Dutch from the lower Hudson Valley. The Village The site of Cossayuna Village is a natural crossroads and the development of a village was greatly helped by the fact that the outlet of the lake offered potential water power. Water power, even in such small measure as is to be found here, was in great demand in the early days for grinding grain and for sawing the vast harvest of logs. There were three power sites developed at the village pond and before 1800, each of them operated a saw mill. An early mill was built by Asa Carter below the village. The first grist mill was built in 1810 and was operated for approximately sixty years. For many of these years, William S. Taber was the miller. The last miller was Casper Dings. The most extensive of the manufacturing enterprises was the blanket factory operated at the lower power site by William and James Alexander. This small factory which produced inexpensive woolen blankets operated from 1885 to 1915. It furnished employment for about a dozen men and women. These little water powers are now idle and probably have no value as generators of power, but the upper dam, near the post office, serves to maintain the present level of the lake. Civil Government Originally, all the community was in the town of Argyle in the county of Albany of the Province of New York. The Argyle Patent had made provision for the establishment of town government. Such government was set up in 1771. The town supervisors for the first ten years were from the East Greenwich area in the present town of Greenwich. Charlotte county was set off from Albany in 1772. The county name was changed to Washington in 1784. The town of Argyle was formally established by the state in 1786. At that time the west two-thirds of the present town of Greenwich and the whole of the present town of Fort Edward were added to the township. In 1803 the town of Greenwich was set off from Argyle. The first election in the county was in 1778. Only 198 votes were cast and there was no voting in Argyle. The establishment of the town of Greenwich divided the Cossayuna community between the two towns. In Greenwich are; the east shore north to include the Y.M.C.A. camp, the Bunker Hill and Sand Street regions, the village of Cossayuna and as far west on the South Argyle Road as the foot of Ramsey Hill. All the remainder of the community, including two thirds of the shore line of the lake, is in the town of Argyle. Cossayuna Lake Improvement Association The Cossayuna Lake Improvement Association (CLIA) was formed in 1954 by a group of residents of the vicinity surrounding Cossayuna Lake. The first meeting was held on August 22 of that year. Officers were elected, committees appointed, and various matters were discussed concerning the good and welfare of the community. Subsequently, a constitution and by-laws were adopted, and the Association was incorporated. The main purpose of the early organization was to encourage social life among its members, promote social activities among the younger members of the community, and to promote the health and general welfare, improvement and advancement of the community. The organization maintains a website: http://www.cossayunalake.com.

The concept of zagranitsa influenced Soviet life and culture from the 1950s until the 1980s. It manifested itself in a widespread fascination with Western manufactured goods, films, music, fashion and ideas. Alexei Yurchak, in his 2006 book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation, describes zagranitsa as an \\"imaginary elsewhere\\" that was \\"simultaneously knowable and unattainable, tangible and abstract, mundane and exotic\\". The idea of zagranitsa as utopia, at once an aspiration, a negation, and a reflection of the Soviet Union itself, became embedded into Soviet culture and identity. Once travel to the United States became more accessible with Perestroika, the \\"imaginary West\\" lost its mythical connotations, resulting in disappointment and disillusionment. As Svetlana Boym writes of the 1985 hit song \\"The Last Letter\\" (also known as \\"Goodbye Amerika\\") by Russian rock group Nautilus Pompilius, bidding farewell to America‚Äî that is, \\"the beloved Amerika of Soviet underground culture‚Ä¶ the mythical West of the Russian imagination\\"‚Äîwas as painful as bidding farewell to Soviet culture itself and the \\"utopian fantasy land of one's youth\\". Background According to Maurice Hindus (writing in 1953), the word zagranitsa had always \\"exercised a spell\\" over ordinary Russians, due to the vastness of the country, the enforced isolationism of living in villages, and the restriction of movement under Soviet rule. For centuries, Russians had been granted glimpses of zagranitsa and the West through the \\"window\\" opened by Peter the Great, as well as the reports of the privileged few who were able to go abroad and the rare appearance of aliens who visited Russia. The majority of the country remained generally closed to foreign influence until World War II. The war brought an influx of Western goods into the Soviet Union due to foreign relief efforts and the Lend-Lease policy enacted in 1941, and the \\"traditional hunger for knowledge of the mysterious zagranitsa was sharpened\\". Hindus writes: Hindus describes the wonder and excitement with which Russians receive Hindus's gifts, everyday items from America‚Äî tea, coffee, Spam, cigarettes, and an electric razor. \\"'So practical and beautiful,' a woman exclaimed as she fondled a pack [of cigarettes] and then passed it to the schoolmaster's wife. 'It's so beautiful,' added the elderly woman. 'I hate to tear it open.' The cans that contained Spam would not be thrown away after their contents were consumed, but, rather, they were often re-used in the kitchen or as flower pots. It was partly the good itself but more so its packaging that engendered wonder and admiration, its clear mark of foreignness as an object from an \\"imaginary elsewhere\\". As Yurchak notes, the desire to possess Western goods, and to keep and display empty packaging and bottles even after they were freed of content, reflected the fact that the link to \\"elsewhere\\" (represented by the materiality of these objects) mattered more than their tangible utility as \\"consumable commodities (the actual liquor, beer, or cigarettes)\\". Their unmistakable Western origin was what \\"endowed them with great power\\". Responses to zagranitsa With the end of the war and the start of the Cold War, officials sought to curb the desire and fascination for the West, which, according to Soviet Minister of Culture Andrei Zhdanov, was a detriment to the national pride of the USSR. In 1946, Zhdanov asked in an address Leningrad: \\"Is it for us‚Ä¶ to bow low before everything foreign?\\" Zhdanov's campaigns against \\"rootless Cosmopolitanism\\" in the early years after the war persecuted progressive composers like Shostakovich and Prokofiev who were deemed too sympathetic to the bourgeois ideologies of the West. At the same time the government encouraged citizens to learn to appreciate other forms of foreign culture. For example, learning foreign languages was encouraged as a part of the duties of an educated Soviet citizen, especially with the advent of shortwave radio. Cultural openness and internationalism had long been promoted, which had been contrasted, in propaganda, against the supposed racism and intolerance of the United States. The shortwave radio was promoted as a cultural tool to shape an internationalist perspective on the world. Although certain radio bands receiving from distant stations‚Äî such as the CIA- funded Radio Liberty‚Äî were always \\"jammed\\" or censored, the permitted bands still could receive from stations such as the BBC World Service, the Voice of America in English, and Radio France International in French. Thus, although partially censored, shortwave radios, which were promoted by the government, provided \\"windows to the west\\" through which Soviet citizens were still able to listen to jazz and rock-and-roll, which were, on the other hand, deemed as \\"bad\\" Cosmopolitanism by officials. The distinction between \\"good\\" Internationalism and \\"bad\\" Cosmopolitanism and the line between acceptable and unacceptable practice were often ambiguous and determined on a case-by-case basis, so in general the verdicts on foreign cultural forms and influences were open to interpretation. This ambiguity allowed interest in zagranitsa to continue as an acceptable part of everyday life. According to Vassily Aksyonov, the \\"combination of vague pro-American feelings and an all-out anti- American propaganda campaign caused a certain segment of Soviet society to start leaning unconsciously in the direction of America in matters aesthetic, emotional, and even to some extent ideological. The 1960s saw a huge increase of interest in foreign languages and philosophies, American literature, and avant-garde jazz as well as a new-found fascination with traveling to exotic \\"elsewheres,\\" with increased interest in the \\"practices of hiking, mountaineering, and going on geological expeditions in the remote nature reserves of Siberia, the Far East and the North\\". As a model The official ambiguity toward zagranitsa was sustained by the fact that the West was often held up as a model for Soviet emulation. As Susan Reid notes, during the 1950s, even as the Socialist way of life was proclaimed as the \\"right\\" path toward prosperity, \\"the Soviet Union also entered into competition on terms set by the US‚Ä¶ The regime couched its promises of economic growth in terms of 'catching up with and surpassing America'. In his address at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, Nikita Khrushchev stated: \\"We can learn something. We look at the American exhibition as an exhibition of our own achievements in the near future\\". Reid noted, \\"[the exhibition] was an instructive museum of the future from which to glean new processes and technologies on which to build Soviet, socialist prosperity\\". Thus the achievements were held up as a kind of Utopian inspiration for the USSR; the perceived competition with the West was inextricably linked with the goals and aspirations of the Soviet Union itself, whose ultimate goal, Communism, thus became intertwined with Western modes of prosperity and consumerism. Zagranitsa and the West became embedded in the model of Socialist Utopia during the second half of the Soviet period. It was essential, although perhaps not apparent at the time, that zagranitsa and the West inevitably functioned as a kind of negation of the Soviet experiment, as it offered an alternative vision of prosperity that was possible without violent world revolution and socialism‚Äîand thus was the antithesis to a Soviet Union founded on Marxism. The persistent and prominent images of American capitalist prosperity proved to be an important part of Socialism's undoing. In popular culture =Music= During the war years, American jazz became associated with the opening of the second front in 1944 and anticipated victory over the Nazis. Army bands learned jazz on the front and performed them at dance halls in Prague, Krakow, and Leningrad after the war. However, American jazz, deemed \\"Cosmopolitan,\\" soon came under attack by the government, despite its roots in black culture. This, according to Yurchak, was representative of the ambiguity and changing standards of what was acceptable and unacceptable, as the integrity of jazz was not assessed by its social class, the usual metric. Although it was publicly criticized, denounced, and listening was made an illicit activity, jazz continued to exist officially in concerts held by state organizations, for example, by Komsomol committees, as long as it was \\"adapted to fit the Soviet context\\". The success with which jazz had actually been adapted is questionable, however. Even when imbued with Soviet melodies or with alternative lyrics, jazz (and rock-and-roll) elicited \\"overly excited\\" reactions from young people, engendered by their associations with zagranitsa. These forms could not be completely dissociated from its associations with the West, but they did acquire their own meanings and significance for the Soviet generation that grew up listening to them. =Fashion= The desire for zagranitsa also manifested itself in the style movement of the stilyagi (plural of stilyaga, meaning \\"stylish\\" or \\"style-hunter\\") that emerged from the 1940s. Stilyagi were Soviet youths who adopted an aesthetic style inspired by American films shown in Soviet theatres. Their clothes were marked by loud patterns and colors and tight fits. Often, because the clothes could not be found in Soviet stores, stilyagi made their own clothes. Some American clothes from Lend-Lease could be found in Soviet secondhand shops. Still others bought their clothing from fartsovshchiks, people who dealt in the illegal business of acquiring and selling foreign goods and currency. Stilyagi listened to jazz and rock-and-roll, and frequented clubs like Hotel Evropeiskaia in Leningrad, which featured the Yosif Vainshtein orchestra and played American swing melodies. However, as Yurchak writes, the stilyagi were a small subculture, and the majority of Soviet Youth looked on stilyagi with disdain. The perception of _stilyagi_ was that they were shallow and \\"uneducated loafers\\" who knew \\"fashions from all over the world\\" but not Griboyedov. Komsomol members and even the police suppressed gatherings of stilyagi. However, the government's attack on these more extreme manifestations of Western influence left alone those who less conspicuously enjoyed zagranitsa. Even during the Stalin years, the Soviet citizen had been encouraged to enjoy consumption of personal, 'bourgeois', pleasures such as dresses, wristwatches and lipstick as long as they were not used to elevate egoism or status, but as a reward for hard work. Thus, only the splashiest aesthetic pursuits of zagranitsa were hindered, while the many Soviet citizens who continued to engage with Western culture in fashion, music, films, and literature in less ostentatious ways escaped criticism. Disillusionment The zagranitsa of the late Soviet period was an imaginary place, constructed from pieces of Western culture from films, jazz and rock-and-roll vinyls, and the glossy pages of magazines, the imaginings of a distant \\"abroad\\". Aksyonov describes the perception he had had of America as \\"impossibly idealized and distorted\\". Partly because zagranitsa was \\"forbidden fruit\\", it had been desired and idealized. However, when Soviets came into real contact with the West, the result was often surprise and disappointment. In the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, which famously displayed a 'slice' of the American way of life in its kitchen exhibition, some Soviet spectators reacted with ambivalence and disappointment: With Perestroika, the United States and the West became more accessible to Soviet citizens and suddenly \\"it became obvious that the Imaginary West was something very different from the real West\\". This realization forced a reevaluation of the late Soviet period and of Soviet identity in general. The theme of disillusionment with the imaginary abroad is presented in several post-Soviet films, including Stilyagi (2008) (Hipsters in English) directed by Valery Todorovsky and You Are My Only One (1993), directed by Dmitry Astrakhan. Lawton notes that the theme of realization of zagranitsa as imaginary in these films usually strikes a patriotic note as protagonists learn to choose their real, if imperfect homelands over imagined foreign utopias.

Walker Park was once the St. John's Burial Ground for St. John's Chapel of Trinity Church. It was in use from 1799 to 1858, with over 10,000 burials there. New York politician William H. Walker originated the idea for the park in 1888. In 1890 he succeeded in getting a bill through the legislature condemning the ground for park purposes. The parks department acquired the land in 1895; most of those buried there were not removed. The park - which was designed by the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings - was originally called \\"St. John's Park,\\" which had also been the name of a no- longer-extant park about a mile south on Hudson Street from about 1827 to 1867. The later park was renamed \\"Hudson Park\\" in 1896, and finally became \\"James J.

Description The tree weta in New Zealand are large flightless nocturnal insects.O'Brien, B., & Field, L. (2001). Morphology and Anatomy of New Zealand Wetas. Department of Biological Sciences, University of Waikato. Weta have three main sections to their body, the head, thorax and abdomen. Tree weta are often distinguished by their sizable hindlegs, strong jaws, tusks on the males, their glossy and hard exoskeleton and their size. Weta often have antennae twice as long as their bodies,Crowe, A.(2002). Which New Zealand Insect? Penguin Books. which are used to help it feel its way in the dark and safely navigate. Structurally male tree wetas have a larger head than the females, which may make up 40% of their body length. The females have a long spike on their back called an ovipositor which is used for egg laying. Male weta have two cerci (a pair of short tapering sensory feelers) projecting at their rear and they do not have an ovipositer. Males have a proportionately smaller abdomen than the females and \\"their reproductive structures are internal, apart from two pairs of tiny lobes beneath the cerci.\\"Gibbs, G. (1998). New Zealand Weta. Auckland, New Zealand: Reed Publishing. H. femorata is distinguished by its colour patterns, cream-yellow banding which extends around and across the abdomen. Each segment of the abdomen has reddish dark- brown marks. On the prothorax and on the hind femora there are irregular black markings.Townsend, J. A., Brown, B., Potter, M. A., & Stringer, I. A. N. (1997). Distribution, habitat and conservation status of Hemideina ricta and H. femorata on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 21(1), 43‚Äì49. Some H. femorata have a retrolateral apical spine present on the hind femora.  Distribution  = Natural global range = There are other insects around the world which are related to the weta family. There are \\"long-legged Cave crickets or Camel crickets\\" which look similar to weta and are found in places such as Australia, Chile, Europe and Asia. Although there are other species worldwide which are similar, weta are only found in New Zealand. The Canterbury tree weta is endemic and is restricted to the Canterbury region of New Zealand.Pfl√ºger, H., Field, L. H., Nishino, H., & Currie, M. J. (2011). Neuromodulatory unpaired median neurons in the New Zealand tree weta, Hemideina femorata. Journal of Insect Physiology,57(10), 1420‚Äì1430. doi:10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.010 = New Zealand range = Hemideina femorata is limited to a particular range in the Canterbury region.Hale, M., Hale, R., & Alabergere, G. (2010). Polymorphic microsatellite loci for the Banks Peninsula tree weta Hemideina ricta, and cross amplification in H. femorata. Conservation Genet Resour: Department of Ecology, Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand. The distribution of this weta extends along the east coast from Kaikoura to Geraldine and can be found as far west as Nelson. The Kanuka forests near Kaikoura are a common place where these weta can be found. A study in 1997 examined the distribution of Hemideina femorata on Banks Peninsula and found that all species were found below an altitude of 450 m, with a majority of them located on north-east facing slopes. = Habitat preferences = Weta are often found in vacated tunnels in branches or trunks of trees, which are often initially made by other insects.Field, L., & Sandlant, G. (2001). The Gallery-related Ecology of New Zealand Tree Wetas, Hemideina femorata and Hemideina crassidens (Orthoptera, Anostotomatidae) (pp. 243‚Äì259). Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury. These tunnels are termed as galleries, as the tree wetas are said to enlarge and clean their tunnels. A report in 2001 has been reported that H. femorata occupy a wide variety of trees, including kanuka (Kunzea ericoides), lacebark (Hoheria angustifolia), mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), broadleaf (Griselinia littoralis) tree fushia (Fuchsia excorticata) and beech (Fuscospora solandri). The research by Townsend in 1997 found that H. femorata were found significantly more within kanuka. Field and Sandlant in 2001 reported that H. femorata was found in at an altitude of 320 m or less within kanuka even if the kanuka extended above 320 m. Tree weta tend to show a preference for living in groups. Life cycle/phenology Adult weta hardly ever move more than a few metres from their home base. The exception to this is when the females climb down from the tree to lay their eggs. Females tend to need extra protein before laying their eggs, so they will eat their \\"old skins which shed during their lifetime.\\" \\"They will also eat other dead or injured insects, and even their own kind at these times.\\"Meads, M. (1997). The Weta Book: A Guide to the Identification of Wetas. Landcare Research New Zealand Ltd. There is a very simple courtship ritual for the Hemideina femorata. The male initiates the interaction, this involves \\"the general antennation (touching with the antenna), palpation and genital probing of females prior to attempting to copulate\\". (Field, 2000). The tree weta tends to lay her eggs in autumn (around April or May).Gibbs, G. (2017). Tree wƒìtƒÅ. Retrieved 9 April 2017, from http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/weta This is a good time, because in autumn, the soil is softer, due to rainfall, than in the summer. The female tree weta travels to the ground to find the right location and soil for her to lay her eggs. The female uses the tip of her ovipositor to check the soil to make sure it is a suitable place for the eggs. When she finds the right location she \\"lifts the end of her abdomen and twists the ovipositor vertically down, she pushes it as deep as it will go into the soil.\\" The depth of her ovipositor in the soil is about 15 mm. The females do not lay their eggs all at once, they do this periodically over several weeks. Females can lay up to 200 eggs over two or three months. Each set of eggs is placed in a different location. The female can lay one egg or up to six eggs in a group. Weta \\"eggs are about 6mm long and 1.5mm thick\\". They lie in the soil over winter and they tend to hatch in about October or November. It is very important to have damp soil during this incubation period, so they eggs can hatch more successfully. The tiny weta splits the egg shell and makes its way up to the surface of the soil. Juvenile weta are called nymphs, they live in the foliage of bush and trees for the first few months. \\"They feed on the same food as the adults, mainly leaves but with some insect prey if they can find them.\\" A study conducted by Stringer showed that adult tree weta sex ratios change with the time of year. From November to January there are less than 15% more females than males, as the year goes on the males numbers drop drastically until early March where then only females remain. The reproductive cycle of the weta is incomplete, this is known as an incomplete metamorphosis.Stringer, I. (n.d). The Reproductive Biology and Eggs of New Zealand Anostostomatidae. Palmerston North, New Zealand: Ecology Group, Institute of Natural Resources. Tree wetas mainly go through nine instars. Moulting occurs after a weta has lost weight and been relatively inactive tending not to drink or eat for 4 to 14 days. When moulting occurs, most weta hang from a branch or substrate and moult out of their exuviae and fall to the ground where they rest for a while. Hemideina femorata moults up to six times.Stringer, I., & Cary, P. (n.d). Postembronic Development and Related Changes. Palmerston North, New Zealand: Ecology Group, Institute of Natural Resources. Males come to adulthood sooner than females and have to wait for mating until the females are ready. Mating often happens in the galleries at night. H. Femorata will mate for up to 6 minutes. Females will mate only after they weigh four times as much initially and then will lay eggs/oviposit at round roughly 100 days after courtship. The eggs of most weta are laid in vertically the soil. Females are said to guard their eggs and occasionally guard the first-instar nymphs too.Stringer, I. (n.d). The Reproductibe Biology and Eggs of New Zealand Anostostomatidae. Palmerston North, New Zealand: Ecology Group, Institute of Natural Resources. The juvenile weta shed their skin many times before they become an adult. This is essential because the exoskeleton of the weta does not stretch. Canterbury tree weta are inactive one to two days before they moult and they become paler. Most weta shed their skin at night. \\"When moulting, most weta hang head downward with their hind legs, and sometimes also their middle legs, firmly hooked on to vegetation.\\" The ecdysis begins when abdomen of the weta starts undergoing rhythmic contractions. The thorax and anterior of the abdomen are usually the first to emerge from the old skin. The antenna is commonly the last to be pulled out. The weta tend to eat their old cuticle (skin) after they shed it. Tree weta moult at least 10 times over two years. Hemideina femorata reach maturity when they are two years old, they can then go on to live up to 12 years in captivity. Diet and foraging The head of the weta is used for feeding and receiving information about its environment. Hemideina femorata tend to be vegetarians and can survive eating leaves or carrots but if a freshly killed caterpillar, grasshopper or even another weta comes across their path, they will eat it. These weta eat \\"fresh leaves off a variety of trees shrubs and weeds\\", they are particularly fond of karamu (Coprosma robusta) and mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus). Predators, parasites and diseases Major threats to weta include short tailed bats, birds, and reptiles such as lizards and tuataras. Birds that tend to eat this weta include the kiwi, robin, tomtit and ruru.Massey University. (2014). Weta Geta: A Comprehensive Guide to New Zealand Orthopedia Tree Weta Ecology. Other introduced threats include cats, hedgehogs, rats and mustelids. Another major threat is humans as they tend to destroy the habitat of the weta.Department of Conservation. (2006). Weta http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/invertebrates/weta/ These weta tend to avoid locations where spiders are present. The Canterbury tree weta also have a tendency to avoid slugs. Other information To produce sound and communicate the Hemideina femorata moves \\"the sides of the abdomen against the inner surface of the hind-legs with these legs stationary in the resting position.\\" This rapid stutter is produced by two kinds of movement. One movement involves the \\"contraction and slight upward curling of the abdomen\\" of the weta.Barrett, P. (1991). Keeping Wetas in Captivity: A Series of Nine Articles for Schools and Nature-Lovers. Wellington Zoological Gardens, New Zealand. The other movement is the weta \\"raising and lowering its abdomen.\\" \\"Both of these are used as eviction or move-along calls by male and female weta\\" the second movement is used mostly by adult weta. The adult Hemideina femorata seem ready to mate with other adult tree weta, not just their own species. Some of these weta share the same tree with other weta such as Hemideina ricta. This attempt to mate can cause a hybridisation in the species of weta. This only occurs with weta found in the same geographical location, such as both weta naturally living in the south or the north. For example, a Wellington tree weta (Hemideina crassidens) male was placed with a Canterbury tree weta (Hemideina femorata) female, there was no attempt of them mating at all. It is mostly tree weta who have been found to mate like this. Hybrids of Hemideina femorata and Hemideina ricta have been found in an overlap of habitat areas in the east of the Akaroa Harbour and Banks Peninsula. Culturally the Maori people of New Zealand would refer to the weta as \\"the devil who comes in the night\\" Salmon, J. T. (1956). A Key to the Tree and Ground Wetas of New Zealand. Wellington: Tuatara : Journal of the Biological Society. Also the Maori would use them as a source of protein.

Berchet worked under the direction of Wallace Carothers at DuPont Experimental Station and first synthesized nylon 6,6 on February 28, 1935 from equal parts hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid. Berchet was the first to synthesize neoprene. However, Arthur Collins is credited with its discovery on April 17, 1930 after he accidentally reacted hydrochloric acid with vinylacetylene. Berchet's leaving of his sample unexamined on a laboratory bench until after Collin's discovery prevented him from being credited with its discovery. Nylon is a synthetic polymer that can be melt-processed into fibers, films, and shapes and has significant applications in a wide variety of commercial products including apparel, electrical equipment, and food packaging. Neoprene or polychloroprene is a synthetic rubber produced by the polymerization of chloroprene. It is used in a wide variety of applications, such as electrical insulation, laptop sleeves, and automotive fan belts.  Education and early life  G√©rard Berchet was born in Lyon, France on December 3, 1902. Berchet studied chemistry at the Coll√®ge de France and received his doctorate in chemistry from the University of Colorado in June, 1929. During the Summer of 1926 Berchet had met and befriended Wallace Carothers in Paris. Carothers and his colleague Jack Johnson helped Berchet get a visa to the United States and on September 8, 1926 Berchet, Carothers, and Johnson sailed third class together on the French Line's SS Paris from Le Havre to New York. On September 14, 1926 Berchet arrived on Ellis Island to be cleared by immigration after a six-day voyage notable for the champagne bottle ceremoniously opened and drank each day by Berchet, Carothers, and Johnson, who were all facing Prohibition in America.  Career and research  = DuPont = In June, 1929, G√©rard Berchet began work at DuPont. Berchet was a member of a research group led by Wallace Carothers actively working on polymerization in \\"Purity Hall\\" at the DuPont Experimental Station. Other personnel working in the group were Paul J. Flory, Charles Stine, Julian W. Hill, Edgar W. Spangle, Donald Coffman, F. J. L. VanNatta and Joe Labovsky. The assignment of the group was to make polyesters via condensation polymerizations. Their initial attempts to create suitable commercial fibers failed as the fibers, while uniform and appearing to be strong, elastic and resilient, melted at low temperatures and were soluble in solvents. The group then turned their attention to using diacidic and dibasic molecules to create polyamide fibers based on condensation reactions. During his time at DuPont Berchet, played a pivotal role int the invention of neoprene and nylon. However, Berchet is fully credited with neither discovery. In March, 1930, Berchet was the first to synthesize neoprene by combining monovinyl acetylene with concentrated hydrochloric acid, but Arthur Collins was the first to discover neoprene several weeks later on April 17, 1930 since Berchet did not examine his sample until late April. Under the direction of Wallace Carothers Berchet synthesized nylon 6-6 from equal parts hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid on February 28, 1935. Berchet was not an obsessive inventor and served in the patent section at DuPont rather than the chemical department in the years following World War II.  Neoprene  Wallace Carothers of DuPont assigned Berchet to isolate vinylacetylene in early 1930 as part of a larger project on divinyl acetylene. Fr Julius Arthur Nieuwland, a professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame, had produced divinyl acetylene during his research on acetylene chemistry. DuPont purchased the patent rights for divinyl acetylene after Dr Elmer K. Bolton attended a lecture by Nieuwland. By February 20, 1930 Berchet had isolated enough vinylacetylene from divinyl acetylene to study. After a series of inconclusive experiments, Berchet, under the direction of Carothers, treated monovinyl acetylene with a variety of reagents and put 25 samples in sealed containers. One of these samples was monovinyl acetylene combined with concentrated hydrochloric acid. However, Berchet let his samples stand for five weeks on his laboratory bench before determining what transformations might have occurred. Before Berchet examined his samples Arthur Collins accidentally discovered chloroprene on April 17, 1930 by combining monovinyl acetylene with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Arthur Collins was assigned to Carother's group in early February and had previously worked with divinyl acetylene while at the Jackson Laboratory. Chloroprene, now known as neoprene, was the first synthetic rubber. DuPont marketed the product under the name DuPrene in 1931.  Nylon  Wallace Carothers' group at the DuPont Experimental Station had been utilizing condensation polymerizations to make polyesters. But, the fibers made under this process would melt at low temperatures and were soluble in common solvents and were therefore not suitable as commercial products. Carothers' group instead turned their attention to using diacidic and dibasic molecules in order to create polyamide fibers. After several repeated failures the group decided to complete a systematic study of potential polyamides through combining diamines with a similar series of diacids. 81 potential candidates for polyamides were identified and Berchet was assigned in 1935 to the polyamide project to work on them. Berchet constructed and purified many of the diamines himself so that they could be polymerized. In his research Berchet decided to study more than linear diamines and diacids and made examples of several other types of polyamide polymers. On February 28, 1935 Berchet prepared nylon 6-6, a condensation copolymer constructed from equal parts adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine. Berchet's laboratory notes from his creation of nylon 6-6 are as follows:Gerard J. Berchet, copy of a DuPont Notebook page. (Anne Knepley) The half-ounce of pearly, lustrous mass obtained became DuPont's nylon. The fibers formed were elastic and strong after cold drawing and were both unaffected by water or most solvents and had a higher melting point than previous fibers. The fibers were initially called Fiber 6-6, but were eventually named Nylon 6-6.  Personal life  G√©rard Berchet met his wife, Ruth, during his time at Colorado University. After Berchet completed his Ph.D. in 1929, he and Ruth moved to Wilmington, Delaware to work for Carothers at the DuPont Experimental Station. Berchet had two children, Dennis and Anne. Berchet was a voracious reader and lover of music. He was described as a handsome man with rich, curly hair. In Wilmington Berchet joined a small acting troupe called the Brandywinders in 1932 and played in 47 of their productions over 50 years. Berchet had a passionate love for his adopted homeland of America. In an interview he stated America as \\"a country where the majority of men and women were obliging, kind-hearted, open-handed, generous to a fault, and didn't even seem to know it.\\" Later in his career he would become an outspoken francophile, declaring virtually everything in his native France better.

They are made from flexible wooden twigs, such as willow, and are split down the middle and wrapped carefully, usually into animal shapes. There are several variations in wrapping styles across the states, and are thought to have had various functions as well in past societies. They have been radiocarbon dated, among other techniques, to between 2,000 and 4,000 years ago. This places split-twig figurines around roughly the Archaic and Late Archaic era of North America. Types There are two distinct styles of figurines, which served two different functions, one is considered to be religious or ritualistic (such as totems) and the other was possibly a children‚Äôs toy. The term ‚Äòtotem‚Äô by definition can vary, but as it is used by anthropologists, it is done so to show the natural object, such as a plant or animal, that a social group uses to identify its members. Also, the image or object that said group creates to symbolize their relationship with the natural species. In this case, the figurines are believed to symbolize animals within the geographic area in which they were found. There are two different styles of split-twig figurine construction; one named the Grand Canyon and the other the Green River. Since their discovery in the 1930s, more than 400 specimens were subsequently discovered from over 30 sites across the four western states. Radiocarbon dates have revealed that split-twig figurines were constructed for almost 1,700 years during the Late Archaic period in the Southwest. The different styles come from how they are made, specifically wrapped, and also other features, such as plant or animal material, or even other artifacts such as a small projectile point, which were inserted inside the figurine most likely sometime during its construction (Coulam 2004). The plant material used in their construction does not determine the form or style of the figurine. It is the outermost wrappings of the figurine which determine the stylistic differences. Grand Canyon figurines have horizontal body wrappings, with vertical wrappings around the neck. Green River figurines have underlying horizontal body wraps which are overlain with vertical body wraps. The unsplit end of the twig forms the body core in Grand Canyon figurines, but becomes the back legs in the Green River style. A split at the neck or chest falls under Grand Canyon style, while a split at the backend of a figurine is Green River. Locations =Arizona= Split-twig figurines found in Arizona are given the category of Grand Canyon style, and are generally believed to function as social totems, and this is the area believed to be where spit-twig figurines were first discovered in the 1930s. It is also in this state in which many split-twig figurines overall have been discovered, with a higher quantity than other states. It has been speculated that this Grand Canyon style of figurines functioned as magico-religious totems for the hunter- gatherer societies of prehistoric North America. Bighorn sheep or extinct mountain goats are believed to be the animal symbolized in the split-twig figurines found in this area, and not only is it possible they were used to identify members of a group, but they played a religious role in acquiring a successful hunt of these animals. These figurines were not found associated with artifacts that are believed to be a part of daily living activities, such as a packed floor feature, or other food items, etc. (Schwartz, 1958). =Utah= Split-twig figurines were discovered here in the 1930s as well, much like in Arizona, but their discovery wasn‚Äôt published, and therefore made known to the public, until the 1960s. More were discovered in the 1990s. The style of split-twig figurines found in this geographic area were named the Green River, most likely for the river of the same name. These figurines were found in association with other materials that are considered by archaeologists to be a part of daily living, such as food debris or other items and indicators (Jett, 1991). =California= Split-twig figurines found in this area fall under the Green River style, and are considered to have been found in a domestic setting. However, this is debated as the figurines found here may have served a ritualistic function, given the associated artifacts found with them, and other features as well. These figurines are also believed to symbolize bighorn sheep, which were known to live in the area (Davis, 1981).

Background  Since 1979, there have been five cases of kidnapping and/or murder of young girls between ages four and eight (four kidnappings and murders, one kidnapping where the kidnapped girl was never found) occurring within a 20 kilometer radius near the border between Tochigi and Gunma prefectures. All of these cases took place in Ota City of Gunma prefecture or Ashikaga city of Tochigi prefecture.„ÄéÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÁäØ„ÅØ„Åù„Åì„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã: Èö†ËîΩ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂåóÈñ¢Êù±ÈÄ£Á∂öÂπºÂ•≥Ë™òÊãêÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äè Êñ∞ÊΩÆÁ§æ„ÄÅ2013Âπ¥„ÄÅÊ∏ÖÊ∞¥ÊΩîÊó•Êú¨„ÉÜ„É¨„ÉìÂ†±ÈÅìÂ±Ä„ÄéACTIONÊó•Êú¨Â¥©Â£ä ‰∫î„Å§„ÅÆÈõ£Âïè„ÇíÂæπÂ∫ïËøΩË∑°„Åô„Çã„ÄèÊñ∞ÊΩÆÁ§æ„ÄÅ2008Âπ¥12Êúà„ÄÅ  Discovery of the case  In 2007, investigative journalist Kiyoshi Shimizu began investigations into the similarities between the five cases, and came across how the Ashikaga murder case had already been solved, with the supposed culprit Toshikazu Sugaya having admitted (but not been charged with) two other murders. Shimizu's reporting on the subject led to the discovery that Sugaya was innocent, and the National Police Agency and Prosecutor's Office later acknowledged their wrongdoing and the nature of the five cases as a single serial case,„ÄéÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÁäØ„ÅØ„Åù„Åì„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã: Èö†ËîΩ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂåóÈñ¢Êù±ÈÄ£Á∂öÂπºÂ•≥Ë™òÊãêÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äè Êñ∞ÊΩÆÁ§æ„ÄÅ2013Âπ¥„ÄÅ and this was further affirmed by minister Kansei Nakano in a Diet session.http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/177/0014/17703080014004a.html „ÄåÊ®™Â±±„ÇÜ„Åã„Çä„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÅÆ‰∫ã‰ª∂„Å´„Å§„Åç„Åæ„Åó„Å¶„ÅØ„ÄÅÁæ§È¶¨ÁúåË≠¶„Å´„Åä„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÄÅ‰ªñ„ÅÆ‰∫ã‰ª∂„Å®„ÅÆÈñ¢ÈÄ£„ÇÇË¶ñÈáé„Å´ÂÖ•„Çå„Å¶Èã≠ÊÑèÊçúÊüª‰∏≠„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã„Å®ÊâøÁü•„Çí„ÅÑ„Åü„Åó„Å¶„Åä„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Äç The statute of limitations is commonly brought up as all but the last of the 5 cases has had it pass.

Sugaya had previously been denied new DNA tests and a retrial despite DNA evidence presented by his lawyers and the support of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/activity/document/statement/year/2008/080213.htmlhttps://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/document/statements/year/2009/20090623.html Shimizu reported widely on his findings, resulting in a DNA test and Sugaya's release from prison in 2009, and a retrial in 2010 which found him innocent.ÈáåË¶ãÁπÅ „ÄåDNAÈëëÂÆö„ÅÆÂë™Á∏õ Ë∂≥Âà©‰∫ã‰ª∂„Å®È£ØÂ°ö‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÄçÔºà„ÄéÂÜ§ÁΩ™„Çí„Å§„Åè„ÇãÊ§úÂØü„ÄÅ„Åù„Çå„ÇíÊîØ„Åà„ÇãË£ÅÂà§ÊâÄ „Åù„Åó„Å¶ÂÜ§ÁΩ™„ÅØ„Å™„Åè„Å™„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ„Äè„Ç§„É≥„Éë„ÇØ„ÉàÂá∫Áâà‰ºö„ÄÅ2010Âπ¥12Êúà„ÄÅÔºâÂ∞èÊûóÁØ§„ÄéË∂≥Âà©‰∫ã‰ª∂ ÂÜ§ÁΩ™„ÇíË®ºÊòé„Åó„Åü‰∏ÄÂÜä„ÅÆ„Åì„ÅÆÊú¨„ÄèË¨õË´áÁ§æÊñáÂ∫´„ÄÅ2009Âπ¥9Êúà„ÄÅ Shimizu won the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award for exposing this miscarriage of justice.  Murders and kidnappings included in the case  ; 1979 murder of Maya Fukushima: On 3 August 1979, five-year-old Maya Fukushima went missing while playing at a shrine near to her house in Ashikaga. Her body was found naked in a rucksack six days later abandoned next to the Watarase river. ; 1984 murder of Yumi Hasebe: On 17 November 1984, five-year-old Yumi Hasebe went missing from a pachinko parlor. Her body was found on 8 March 1986 in a field 1.7 kilometers away from her home. ; 1987 murder of Tomoko Oosawa: On 15 September 1987, eight-year-old Tomoko Oosawa left her house in Ota and went missing. Her body was found on 27 November 1988 abandoned by the Tone River. ; 1990 murder of Mami Matsuda: The Ashikaga murder case ; 1996 kidnapping of Yukari Yokoyama: On 7 July 1996, four-year-old Yukari Yokoyama went missing from a pachinko parlor. As the girl was never found, this is treated as a disappearance case. The following are used as reasoning behind the definition of this as a serial case: * All cases involved young girls between ages 4 and 8 * In three cases, the victim vanished from a pachinko parlor * In three cases, the body was found next to a river (the Watarase River in two) * Four cases happened on a Friday, weekend, or holiday All five crimes have not been resolved, with the culprit not arrested. The case has been given extensive media coverage, and has been brought up in the Japanese Diet multiple times, and was also addressed by then-prime minister Naoto Kan, who appealed to the police to solve the case.http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/177/0014/17703080014004a.html „Äå„Åì„ÅÆË∂≥Âà©‰∫ã‰ª∂„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅØ„ÄÅÂπ≥Êàê‰∫åÂπ¥„ÄÅÊ†ÉÊú®ÁúåË∂≥Âà©Â∏Ç„ÅßÂΩìÊôÇÂõõÊ≠≥„ÅÆÂ•≥„ÅÆÂ≠ê„ÅåÊÆ∫ÂÆ≥„ÄÅÈÅ∫Ê£Ñ„Åï„Çå„Åü„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂ§ßÂ§âÁóõ„Åæ„Åó„ÅÑ‰∫ã‰ª∂„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÅØ‰ª∞„Åõ„ÅÆ„Å®„Åä„Çä„Åß„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åæ„Åü„ÄÅÁäØ‰∫∫„Åß„Å™„ÅÑÊñπ„Åå„ÄÅËèÖÂÆ∂„Åï„Çì„ÅåÈï∑ÊúüÈñì„Å´„Çè„Åü„Å£„Å¶Âàë„Å´Êúç„Åô„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂÜ§ÁΩ™‰∫ã‰ª∂„Åß„ÇÇ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åù„ÅÜ„ÅÑ„Å£„ÅüÊÑèÂë≥„Åß„ÄÅ‰ªä„ÅäË©±„ÅÆ„ÅÇ„Å£„Åü„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„ÄÅËøëÈö£„Åß„ÇÇÂêå„Åò„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™‰∫ã‰ª∂„Åå‰∫î‰ª∂„ÇÇ„ÅÇ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„ÅÆÂæ°ÊåáÊëò„ÇÇ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÊçúÊüª„Åù„ÅÆ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅÆ‰∏ÄËà¨ÁöÑ„Å™Âú®„ÇäÊñπ„ÅØ‰∏ÄËà¨ÁöÑ„Å´‰∏Ä„Å§„ÅÆ„É´„Éº„É´„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã„Åã„Å®ÊÄù„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„Åë„Çå„Å©„ÇÇ„ÄÅ„Åæ„Åï„Å´ÂÜ§ÁΩ™‰∫ã‰ª∂„Åß„ÅÇ„Çä„ÄÅ„Åï„Çâ„Å´„Åù„ÅÆÂæå„ÇÇ‰∫ã‰ª∂„Åå„ÄÅÈ°û‰ºº„ÅÆ‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÅåÁ∂ö„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÇíËÄÉ„Åà„Åæ„Åô„Å®„ÄÅ‰ªäÂæå„ÅÆ„Åì„ÅÜ„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂêå‰∏Ä„ÄÅÂêåÁ®ÆÈ°û„ÅÆ‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÇíÈò≤„Åê„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÊÑèÂë≥„Åã„Çâ„ÇÇ„ÄÅÂøÖË¶Å„Å™„Åì„Å®„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅØ„Åó„Å£„Åã„ÇäÂØæÂøú„Åô„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÅåË≠¶ÂØüÁ≠â„Å´„Åä„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÇÇÂøÖË¶Å„Åß„ÅØ„Å™„ÅÑ„Åã„Å®„ÄÅ‰ªä„ÅÆ„ÅäË©±„ÇíËÅû„Åç„Å™„Åå„Çâ„Åù„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´ÊÑü„Åò„Åü„Å®„Åì„Çç„Åß„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Äç Security camera footage of the culprit exists from the 1996 kidnapping case, and eyewitnesses from the Ashikaga case have stated that he strongly resembles the man they saw. In 2010 and 2011, Shimizu reported strong evidence that the perpetrator had been found, including DNA test results connecting him to the Ashikaga case (a 100% match to the results of new tests of the perpetrator's DNA) and video recordings of him talking to young girls and making them sit on his lap, and gave this information to the police, but no arrest was made. The reasoning given for the refusal to arrest the alleged perpetrator was that his DNA does not match that of the culprit previously found in the Ashikaga case. Shimizu professes that the DNA testing methods used in the Ashikaga case were flawed, and that arresting the perpetrator would require the prosecutor's office to acknowledge this. However, the same testing methods were also used in the Iizuka case, in which the alleged culprit was executed in 2008 despite requests for new DNA tests and a retrial, and acknowledging that the testing methods were flawed would lead to a massive scandal around that case.http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/11/28/national/media- national/journalist-wants-ashikaga-murder-case-reopened/ Shimizu's investigations into the Iizuka case found the possibility that a large amount of the evidence was doctored, and he concludes that it was the amount, and not quality of the evidence which led to the conviction, and that overturning even one piece of evidence would have caused the prosecutor's case to fall apart.„ÄéÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÁäØ„ÅØ„Åù„Åì„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã: Èö†ËîΩ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂåóÈñ¢Êù±ÈÄ£Á∂öÂπºÂ•≥Ë™òÊãêÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äè Êñ∞ÊΩÆÁ§æ„ÄÅ2013Âπ¥„ÄÅÈáåË¶ãÁπÅ „ÄåDNAÈëëÂÆö„ÅÆÂë™Á∏õ Ë∂≥Âà©‰∫ã‰ª∂„Å®È£ØÂ°ö‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÄçÔºà„ÄéÂÜ§ÁΩ™„Çí„Å§„Åè„ÇãÊ§úÂØü„ÄÅ„Åù„Çå„ÇíÊîØ„Åà„ÇãË£ÅÂà§ÊâÄ „Åù„Åó„Å¶ÂÜ§ÁΩ™„ÅØ„Å™„Åè„Å™„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ„Äè„Ç§„É≥„Éë„ÇØ„ÉàÂá∫Áâà‰ºö„ÄÅ2010Âπ¥12Êúà„ÄÅÔºâ Additionally, when the mother of Mami Matsuda was informed by the police that they were no longer investigating her daughter's case due to the statute of limitations, she requested that they return her daughter's belongings, but they refused to return the shirt which has the true culprit's semen stains on it. They refused to give a straight answer as to why, and Shimizu suspects that this is because they are afraid that others might have the DNA of the true culprit tested by modern means, proving that the methods previously used returned wrong results.„ÄéÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÁäØ„ÅØ„Åù„Åì„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã: Èö†ËîΩ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂåóÈñ¢Êù±ÈÄ£Á∂öÂπºÂ•≥Ë™òÊãêÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äè Êñ∞ÊΩÆÁ§æ„ÄÅ2013Âπ¥„ÄÅ See also *DNA profiling *Police misconduct *Judicial system of Japan *Ashikaga murder case References Category:History of Tochigi Prefecture Category:History of Gunma Prefecture Category:Murder in Japan Category:1979 crimes in Japan Category:1980 crimes in Japan Category:1984 crimes in Japan Category:1990 crimes in Japan Category:1997 crimes in Japan Category:Overturned convictions Category:Human rights abuses in Japan Category:People wrongfully convicted of murder Category:Serial murders in Japan Category:1979 murders in Asia Category:1980 murders in Asia Category:1984 murders in Asia Category:1990 murders in Asia Category:1997 murders in Asia Category:1970s murders in Japan Category:1980s murders in Japan Category:1990s murders in Japan Category:Female murder victims Category:Unidentified serial killers Category:Violence against women in Japan ","title":"North Kanto Serial Young Girl Kidnapping and Murder Case"},{"id":"54065276","text":"Ballston Lake is a lake that is located northeast of Burnt Hills, New York in the town of Ballston.

It was published by McClelland & Stewart and won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 2009. The novel depicts the relations between and among a white woman and aboriginal men.  Plot  The story takes place in 1970s when the Ojibwe occupied the Anicinabe Park in Kenora at a community called \\"The Retreat\\" in a remote island. The community is run by Doctor Amos, who treats his psychiatric patients in an unconventional way in a sanctuary like place he has created. Raymond Saymour, who is eighteen years old, and his younger brother Nelson belong to the native Ojibwe community. They have met each other after a long time as Nelson had been adopted by a white family. The Byrd family visits The Retreat for rehabilitation of Mrs. Byrd. They have four children, eldest daughter Lizzy of seventeen years old takes care of the youngest two brothers Fish and William. The fourteen-year-old son Everett is in his pubescent age and is in a dilemma about his sexual orientation. Every day when Doctor Amos bathes naked in a pond just outside the Retreat, Everett watches him hiding in the bushes and fancies him. Mr. Byrd does not think much good of this non-conventional method of treating his wife but nevertheless stays just to give his family another trial to get back to normalcy. Fish, the youngest and four-year old, wanders and gets lost a couple of times bring the whole family to toes. A crippled writer Harris befriends all the kids and is unaware of the affair his wife has started with another visitor of the retreat. Raymond, on the other hand fancies white girls and always invites law enforcement officers due to some or the other act of his. Lizzy falls in love with Raymond even after knowing how he keeps getting caught by police. But that stealth on the other hand proves to be the attraction point for her in their relationship. The novel ends with tensions between the Ojibwe brothers Raymond and Nelson and Raymond and Lizzy not being able to unite the two different world they both live in.  Publication and development  The novel was first published on 9 September 2008 by McClelland & Stewart. It was edited by Ellen Seligman. In an interview with McNally Robinson, Bergen mentioned that The Retreat \\"is more political and more about the divide between children and adults\\". Bergen considers his research for novel to be \\"more of a personal, lifelong experience that he drew upon as a writer\\".  Reviews and reception  Richard Wagamese in his review criticised Bergen for presenting \\"little of the racial tension that could be smelled in the air like cordite\\". Canadian author and critic Geoff Pevere in his The Toronto Star review criticed novel's narrative tone and mentioned that it is \\"long on incident and short on joy\\". The novel won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 2009. Berger had earlier won the award in 1996 for A Year of Lesser and in 2005 for The Time in Between. The award is associated with $5,000 cash remunerations. It also won the cash prize of $3,500 associated with the Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction. The novel was longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize which eventually was presented to Through Black Spruce by Joseph Boyden while being adjudged by Margaret Atwood, Bob Rae, and Colm Toibin.

Background TigerSwan is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business based in Apex, North Carolina. The company operates globally. Founder James Reese served in the elite Delta Force unit. He started his career as an ROTC cadet and served in the United States Army for 25 years. Reese was an adviser, commander and operations officer during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The company has over 300 employees and conducts operations in over 50 countries. The TigerSwan firearms training center was located near Cedar Creek in Cumberland County, North Carolina. Since it opened in 2010, the range has offered firearms and tactical training to military, law enforcement and the public. In 2014, Reese sold the training company, and the shooting range changed its name to the Range Complex. In the book Kill Bin Laden Dalton Fury wrote: \\"Delta Force legends like Paul Howe of Combat Shooting and Tactics Inc., Larry Vickers of Vickers Tactical Inc., and Brian Searcy of Tiger Swan Inc., and Kyle Lamb of Viking Tactics Inc., can't only teach you how to shoot a gnat off a bull's ass at fifty yards while on the move but they will actually show you how it's done first.\\" Company history =Iraq War= The firm provided security for the Iraqi Mine-Unexploded Ordnance Clearing Organization, a U.S. State Department funded NGO tasked with clearing munitions and mines in Iraq. =2014 Sochi Olympics= During the 2014 Sochi Olympics, TigerSwan provided security for members of Olympic committees, corporate sponsors and sports fans traveling to Sochi. They said they could pinpoint a client's location within a 3 foot radius using a GPS device provided to their clients. =Standing Rock Protests= TigerSwan was hired by Dakota Access, LLC to provide security consulting during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Internal company documents, which were leaked to The Intercept, reportedly compared the movement opposed to the pipeline with jihadis, calling them \\"an ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component.\\" The Intercept called the DAPL operation a \\"multi-faceted private security operation characterized by sweeping and invasive surveillance of protesters,\\" and reported that the leaked situation and disinformation reports prepared by the company during the protest provide evidence of aerial surveillance, as well as radio eavesdropping. Further revelations emerged from The Intercept leak including: TigerSwan had protesters followed, TigerSwan targeted protesters of Middle-Eastern descent, TigerSwan placed infiltrators at the camps and TigerSwan posted fake social media posts opposing the pipeline. The pipeline needed extra security due to arson and other acts of destruction. For example, on July 24, 2017, activists Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya admitted that they were responsible for setting fires to the pipeline and destroying valves. The two referred to their actions as \\"peaceful\\" because no lives were at risk. The two women cut through the pipeline with a torch, but at one point torched a hole through a part of the pipeline that had oil in it, which caused oil to spill. TigerSwan is currently being sued by North Dakota‚Äôs Private Investigative and Security Board for operating without a license in the state in 2016 and 2017, during which time TigerSwan was working for Dakota Access, LLC. TigerSwan denies the charges. Legal In 2013 TigerSwan filed a lawsuit against the United States in Federal Court alleging breach of contract due to improper termination. The dispute was over two contracts that were awarded by the Department of Defense for Iraq-based security services. The DoD initially awarded the contracts to TigerSwan, but then terminated the contracts and awarded them instead to the British private military company Aegis Defence Services. The Court denied the government's request to dismiss the case, finding that a contractor does not always need to show specific intent in order to prevail on a claim that alleges bad-faith.

He has worked in archaeology for some 40 years, including as a Senior Project Officer at Northamptonshire Archaeology from 1992 to 2014. During that time he excavated a number of large quarries in England and Wales, and excavated the boar-crested Anglo-Saxon Pioneer Helmet in addition to discovering the first definitive evidence for viticulture in Roman Britain. He has also worked for the Museum of London Archaeology, and has taught archaeology and landscape history for Cambridge University, Anglia Ruskin University, the University of Bath, and the Workers' Educational Association. Career The Pioneer Helmet was discovered by Meadows in 1997. Ian David Meadows was born on 5 January 1959. He has worked in archaeology for approximately 40 years. From 1992 to 2014 he worked with Northamptonshire Archaeology as Senior Project Officer, during which time he directed many projects, particularly the excavations of large landscapes in English and Welsh quarries. Starting in about 1993 Meadows began digging in a gravel pit in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, ultimately leading to both the discovery of the first definitive evidence of viticulture from Roman Britain, and the unearthing of the Pioneer Helmet, only the fourth Anglo-Saxon helmet to be found. In 1996, while leading a team with Tony Brown of the University of Exeter's School of Geography and Archaeology, Meadows discovered the first evidence for viticulture from Roman Britain. The find followed the excavation of a series of farms from the Iron and Roman ages, and was soon followed by the discovery of vineyards in the Nene Valley. By 1999 Meadows had found evidence of seven vineyards: four in Northamptonshire, one in Cambridgeshire, one in Lincolnshire and one in Buckinghamshire. One site alone had four miles of trenches, enough to produce about 10,000 litres of wine annually. The seven vineyards covered a combined 30 acres, suggesting to Meadows that \\"research may yet reveal that Britain was a major wine producer in ancient times.\\" The year after discovering the Roman vineyards, in 1997 Meadows discovered the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer Helmet. Also found in Wollaston, it was part of the inhumation of a high-status Anglo-Saxon man, and was found with a pattern welded sword and a hanging bowl. News of the find made newspapers as far away as Australia and New Zealand, for the helmet was only the fourth contemporaneous example to be discovered, coming after those from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, and York, and before two subsequent discoveries from Shorwell and Staffordshire. As of 2016, Meadows is leading the excavations at Chester Farm, a walled Roman town with 10,000 years of history. It has evidence dating back to the Mesolithic, Iron and Medieval ages, as well as farm buildings from the 17th century.

It was established by Thomas Warnes in 1868. He called it 'Koomooloo', but then in 1892, Mr Warnes built a new and larger station nearby, which he also called 'Koomooloo', leading to the older station being known as 'Old Koomooloo'. The origin of the name 'Koomooloo' is unknown. Old Koomooloo is connected with the foundation of the South Australian Country Women's Association. Thomas Warnes' sons took over Koomooloo and Old Koomooloo, and their respective wives Mary (from Koomooloo) and Deborah (from Old Koomooloo) would ride bicycles along bush tracks to meet for tea in the scrub. It was this habit that inspired Mary Warnes eventually to establish the South Australian Country Women's Association. The station was at one point thriving, even leading to the establishment in 1910 of the 'Old Koomooloo, Woolgangi and Sturt Vale Athletics Club'. For many years, Old Koomooloo was owned by Isaac Warnes. By the 1940s, it was owned by Tom Warnes. The station caused headlines in 1947, when Tom Warnes' daughter Christobel was lost at the station. After 30 hours, during which time large numbers of volunteers came from Burra in order to help search for her, and the police brought two Aboriginal trackers from Berri, she was found unharmed.

It consists of three peaks, Mount Peel (often referred to as Big Mt Peel), Middle Mt Peel () and Little Mt Peel/Huatekerekere (). Mt Peel is tall and is owned by the Department of Conservation and Mt Peel Station. It lies just south of the Rangitata river and is north-west of Geraldine. The Peel Forest Park Scenic Reserve is the largest in the Geraldine area, covering around Little Mt Peel/Huatekerekere. Etymology The nearby forest was named by Francis Jollie, who settled in the area in late 1853. Jollie had named the forest after Sir Robert Peel, the British Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who had died in 1850, the year that Canterbury was founded. The mountain and the nearby community of Peel Forest also took Peel's name.  Access  Mt Peel and the surrounding Peel Forest contain many well maintained and popular walking tracks. There is also a small, less maintained track, heading from Little Mt Peel to Middle Mt Peel and then to Mt Peel. Different tracks cater to different climbing abilities, ranging from short 30 minute walks, to full day/overnight tramps. Just below the summit of Little Mt Peel/Huatekerekere is the small Tristram Harper Memorial hut. Complete with rain water storage, two beds and long drop. A trig station is located on top of Little Mt Peel, while a cell tower and communication hut are found at the top of Mt Peel.  Flora and fauna  There is much unique flora and fauna in Peel Forest. The three largest trees in Peel Forest belong to the family Podocarpaceae, a very ancient family going back in time more than 100 million years. The three large trees are kahikatea (white pine), t≈çtara, and mataƒ´ (black pine). 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence.

He was one of the loyal followers of the then Wan Ahmad, and one of the important figures in the Pahang Civil War. Due to his outstanding gallantry during the war, Rasu rose from the rank of khatib to Imam Perang (equivalent to a 'Captain general'). In 1872, Pahang joined the Klang War on the side of Tengku Kudin. Rasu and Tok Bahaman, were the two key Pahang warlords, who with their exceptional leadership emerged victorious in several important battles in Ulu Klang, Kepong, Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Selangor and Hulu Selangor. Pahang's involvement had turned the tide of war to Tengku Kudin's favor, effectively ending the war in Selangor. In recognition of his exploits in the war, Rasu received the title Orang Kaya Imam Perang Indera Gajah of Pahang, where the nickname Tok Gajah was derived, and he was further rewarded with the gift of Pulau Tawar as his personal fief. From the establishment of a British Agency in 1887, the Pahang politics came under the purview of the British government. Increasing pressure was exerted upon the Sultan by the residing British Agent, Hugh Clifford, to administer the state according to the British ideals of just rule and modernisation. This had effectively plunged the state into a seething cauldron of discontent with clashes between traditional chiefs and the British. Tok Bahaman, the chief of Semantan, joined by other nobleman of the interior including Rasu and his son Mat Kilau, rose to arm and openly challenged the British encroachment in the state. The ensuing Pahang War which was won by the British, had made Rasu and his son exiles in Terengganu, where he died in 1901.Sinar Harian - Mahu pindah makam Tok Gajah In modern times, the name Tok Gajah is also renowned as the nickname of the state football team Pahang FA, although it tends to associate more with its literal meaning, the elephant,Pahang 3 JDT 1: Tok Gajah take two-goal lead against Southern Tigers in first leg which is a symbol of Pahang, rather than the historical figure.

Description The thorax of the fly is stripped from the head to tail with black and yellow stripes, the fly's legs are bristly and almost look fluffy. They look very much like the European flesh fly and share similar traits. Distribution = Natural global range = The Striped dung fly is said to have come from south America and is now present in many other places around the world. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Fiji, French Polynesia, Norfolk Island and New Zealand. = New Zealand range = From looking at nature watch and where observations of the striped dung fly has been seen around New Zealand it shows the fly can be found in the north and South Island of New Zealand but they seem to be more abundant in the North Island. These sightings include Sutton Lake, Hurford, Otago, Kaikoura, Kerikeri, Tasman, Taranaki, Manawatu, Rotarua Island, Ruahine Ranges, Omaha Beach and Purakaunui. = Habitat preferences = The striped dung fly is found around the summer months and is commonly found in rubbish, long grasses and flowers. The main habitat that they are found is open pastures and farms this could be due to the cow dung and compost which is what they breed in. Not only do they breed in cow dung most animal dungs as well. So their main habitat is around dung. The striped dung fly prefers a habitat that does not have a large variation in temperature change throughout the day. Life cycle/phenology Due to a lack of information and not being able to find a clear life cycle for the striped dung fly, I have found a life cycle of a closely related species. This being the golden dung fly and the yellow dung fly which are more common in the northern hemisphere, but are from the same family as the striped dung fly. The females lay their eggs in the dung and within a few days the eggs hatch into larvae the eat the dung that they are. After about 21 days of feeding on the dung they burrow into the soil beneath the dung and become pupae. Then they become adult flies. There can be many generations of flies within a year. This life cycle above is common among the dung fly family. Diet and foraging The Sarcophagidae which is from the same family as the Oxysarcodexia (striped dung fly) deposits hatched or hatching maggots instead of laying eggs. They deposit these maggots on either carrion, dung, decaying material, or open mammal wounds. Predators, parasites, and diseases The striped dung fly in New Zealand is said to be involved in the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus and how it is transmitted. An investigation was carried out from 1999 to 2001. There were five species of flies that were trapped and it was shown that the Sarcophagid fly was the most abundant fly on scrub edges but in open pastures it was the striped dung fly and the relationship was found that the abundance of the striped dung fly was associated with the break out of the disease in that area. A known predator of the striped dung fly is the house sparrow and the greenfinch as shown in the study from the New Zealand Journal of Zoology. ‚ÄúOxysarcodexia varia was demonstrated to be capable of vectoring tapeworms Taenia ovis and T. hydatigena, which infest dogs and sheep‚Äù.

Peptidoglycan contains meso-dia-minopimelic acid and with major fatty acid chains and a respiratory quinone. With an ability to grow at a range of temperature from 10-30¬∞C and range of pH from1.5-4.4. This species grows in a variety of acidic such as streams and mines or geothermal sites. Mine lakes with a redoxcline have shown growth with ferrous iron as the electron donor. Fast rates of iron oxidation lead to the regeneration of ferric iron in the ecosystems at a pH as low as 1.5. Potential use in a bioreactor due to cell densities during growth would utilize the ferrous iron oxidation in acid mines. Exopolysacchride production can prevent the encrustation of the bacteria during iron or even other metal substrate metabolism. Mine water impacted environments could use A. ferrooxidans for clean-up capabilities.  Isolates/Sequencing:  Isolate Py-F3: Type strain Py-F3 isolated from the chromosomal DNA in a metal-rich body of water shown different metabolisms for potential growth substrates. North Wales acidic, metal waters allowed isolation of the bacteria at low pH. Strain Py-F3 encodes different enzymes and RubisCO for carbon fixation, but researchers have not studied it in culture. Protein genes found utilizing pathways for sulfur, nitrogen, and iron. Sulfate utilization as the source of sulfur and can use amino acids as a nitrogen source is unique protein coding genes for this isolate Py-F3 because it will have an inability to grow in media unless complex substrates are added. For pH homeostasis the urease genes could produce answers to the survival in these acidic conditions due to the proton pumping ability of the genes. Uptake of urea is present and allow for the intracellular production of urea, rather than taking it in to the cell. = Isolate C25 = Novel isolate from iron snow in a pelagic iron-rich redoxcline zone of a mine lake. Oxidation of Fe(II) and reduction Fe (III) under micro-oxic conditions due to the isolate contributed to the pelagic aggregates. Growth could not occur at low pH than that of isolated Py-F3 at a pH of 2, while C25 had a higher pH tolerance for development. C25 allowed for both oxidation and reduction of the iron cycle leads to insights for microbial use of organic carbon in the process. Compared to Py-F3 the C25 was found to potentially not encode for the ribulose, but future studies will need to be done for a definitive answer.  Culture  Growth through iron metabolism on Tryptic Soy Broth/Agar (TSA/TSB) at low pH, where bacterial colonies form with iron precipitates. Lab conditions of 25¬∞C aerobically allowed for ferrous iron oxidation to occur in sterilized lake medium. Researchers recognized the potential of utilizing A. ferrooxidans for a bioreactor through growth/adherence on solid surfaces. Iron mines make a tremendous growing condition and analogy for the bioreactor due to those similar solid surfaces.

On the way she makes stops where she is confronted with the unheroic and commercialised world she wishes to escape. Publication The book was published through Suhrkamp Verlag on 15 January 2002. An English translation by Krishna Winston was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on 17 July 2007. Reception In the San Francisco Chronicle, Christopher Byrd wrote: \\"Handke's aesthetic agenda in Crossing the Sierra de Gredos is unmistakable. It's executed by a form of philosophically inspired writing that leans less on existentialism, the go-to mode for many cerebral writers in the past, than on deconstruction. By zeroing in on the many things adventure stories leave out - for instance, the quality of the soil that the hero treads underfoot - Handke subverts the genre, so as to unmask our complacency with cliches.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"This newest fiction shows [Handke] at his best and worst. ... The result is a work that embraces a disciplined attempt to acknowledge and celebrate the matter of everyday life (before it vanishes forever?), and a species of literate wool- gathering which seems to confirm Handke‚Äôs frequently reiterated assertion that all that exists is grist for the artist‚Äôs mill. ... Nobody writing today surpasses Peter Handke at trying to make sense of it all.\\" Guy Vanderhaeghe of The Washington Post called the book \\"a beautifully hallucinatory, eerily compelling novel\\".

Neville went into engineering by accident. The Glasgow University prospectus fell open at the page with a Rolls-Royce gas turbine picture and she thought it looked interesting. Her Maths teacher was a mechanical engineer and could tell her about what was involved. After visiting the university open days, she was completely sold on this. She was very close to either studying Maths or Physics. As part of her PhD, she conducted an experimental study of corrosion and tribocorrosion processes on high alloy stainless steels and Ni-alloys and her work led to an increased understanding between the synergies that exist between corrosion and wear processes. Career and research Neville is a mechanical engineer with a specific interest in corrosion, tribology and Processes that occur at engineering interfaces. After her PhD, she was appointed a lecturer at Heriot-Watt University immediately after PhD and started to build a research team. This team grew to 25 researchers in the following years and in 1999 she was promoted to Reader and then Professor in 2002. Neville and her group moved to Leeds in 2003 where she is now Director of the newly formed Institute of Functional Surfaces (iFS) which comprises 70 researchers. The institute has a funding portfolio that spans many agencies and industrial sectors including medical, oil and gas & automotive. Her research group was the first to measure corrosion rates in-situ in hip joint simulators. This was very important in the most recent controversies around metal-on-metal implants. They have used advanced microscopy x-ray spectroscopy to understand how surfaces are lubricated in industrial and medical components. =Awards and honours= Neville was an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Advanced Fellow from 1999 to 2004, elected a Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (FIMechE), elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2005 and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 2010. She was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2011, the Donald Julius Groen Prize for Tribology in 2012, the 2014 STLE Wilbert Shultz Prize, Royal Society Wolfson Research MERIT Award in 2013 and was selected as an EPSRC RISE Fellow in 2014. She was the first woman to be awarded the James Clayton Prize and was awarded the Leverhulme Medal in 2016 for \\"revealing diverse physical and chemical processes at interacting interfaces, emphasising significant synergy between tribology and corrosion.‚Äù Neville was appointed OBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to engineering. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017. = Views = Neville believes that more women in engineering could be achieved by ensuring that at primary school level we have the same number of girls and boys engaging with technology. We must ensure we don't 'lose' talented girls to science and medicine as they progress through secondary school. She has never found any problems with discrimination either in her dealings with the industry (which are extensive) nor in the academic sector.

It was opened in 1998 as a new state-of-the-art youth academy, replacing the older, more informal youth system, enabling the club to focus their youth development and scouting, employing new techniques and FA standards. The centre covers an area of 56 acres. Overview It was overseen by Frank McParland. The Academy now allows the main training ground at Melwood to be kept solely for the first team squad and allows all the areas there to be kept in excellent condition. It also provides a stepping stone for youngsters to progress to the highest levels of football at Liverpool. Scouts attend many local youth matches looking for talented boys. A boy will then be invited to attend training sessions at the Academy. They are currently taken in as young as the age of six. Former England International player Jamie Carragher started at Liverpool when he was aged just nine, with Michael Owen joining at eleven, and Steven Gerrard joining at the age of eight. At this age, the boys start by simply attending after-school training sessions, but as they reach their middle-teens, their academic needs will be taken over by the Academy if they are deemed athletically talented enough. As such, the Academy has a lecture theatre and a computer-equipped classroom. The Academy can handle up to twenty boys in each year group, although the actual number in each year group is usually around eighteen. Between the ages of eight and twelve the boys play in eight-a-side games of three twenty-minute periods. It allows the boys to play as defenders or as attackers in small groups within a system and is not as physically demanding as playing eleven-a-side matches. There are four full-size grass pitches and one with a Polytan surface. There are also a further seven smaller pitches and an indoor arena. The grounds cover an area of 56 acres. On the walls of the indoor centre hang the words 'Technique', 'Attitude', 'Balance', and 'Speed'. 'TABS' is the key word preached at The Academy. Academy director Alex Inglethorpe has said the remit of the academy is to produce physically, technically, tactically and mentally elite players with enough quality to represent the senior side in the Champions League. Liverpool won the 2005 Champions league with two locally born academy graduates starting in the final. In 2017, the club officers revealed a plan of a proposed redevelopment of the centre with cost of ¬£50 million. It is envisaged to incorporate the first team and the academy. The plan is expected to be completed before the 2019-20 season.Stunning pictures of Liverpool's new training ground See also *Melwood *Anfield *Liverpool F.C.

Applications Propynyllithium is used in the organic synthesis as a reactant. It is a nucleophile that adds to aldehydes to give secondary alcohols, with ketones to give tertiary alcohols, and with acid chlorides to give ketones containing the propynyl group.

Set over a period of eleven years, its plot follows a single mother who is faced with raising her grandson after her daughter goes missing under mysterious circumstances. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2018. It was given a limited release on June 14, 2019, by Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment, and has received generally favorable critical reviews. Plot In 1998, in a rural small-town Pennsylvania, Deb Callahan is a 33-year-old single mother residing with her teenage daughter, Bridget, and Bridget's infant son, Jesse. Deb had Bridget when she was 16 years old and Bridget's father is not in the picture. They live directly across the street from her older sister, Katherine, Katherine's husband Terry, and their children. Deb and Katherine have a loving but tempestuous relationship, as the reserved Katherine is critical of Debra's recklessness and her affairs with men. It is a similar relationship to that of Deb and her mother, Peggy. One night, Deb babysits Jesse so Bridget can go on a date with Tyler, Jesse's father, with whom Bridget has had an on-and-off relationship. The next morning, Deb realizes Bridget has not returned home. She calls around frantically and questions Tyler, who claims he and Bridget argued and that she went to her friend Jenna's home. Jenna tells Deb that Bridget left late that evening, saying she was going to walk home. Detective Sergeant Morris begins an investigation into Bridget's disappearance, and Deb insists that Tyler is responsible, claiming she believes he has abused Bridget. Feeling helpless in the efforts to find Bridget, Debra seeks solace in Brett, a married man with whom she is having an affair. When Brett fails to meet with her for one of their trysts, she drunkenly confronts him and his wife in their home, and smashes various items in the kitchen. She then leaves, driving recklessly before removing her hands from the steering wheel and crashing down an embankment, attempting suicide. However, she survives the event unscathed. Several years later, Bridget's disappearance has turned into a cold case, and Deb is raising Jesse. Her boyfriend Ray, a refinery worker, has moved into her home. Ray is controlling and abusive toward Deb and Jesse, but she tolerates it as he gives her financial support while she attends a local college. However, she eventually forces him out of the home when he violently beats her in front of Jesse after inquiring about what time she got home the previous night with friends. Deb continues to hold vigils on Bridget's passing birthdays, and reunites with Tyler, who has recently completed drug rehabilitation, allowing him to visit with Jesse. Tyler tells Deb that he blames her for his drug addiction, as she publicly accused him in Bridget's disappearance. Deb apologizes, and explains she has not suspected him in Bridget's disappearance in a long time. Tyler tries to build a relationship with Jesse, but is unsuccessful. Upon finishing college, Debra finds work as a human resources supervisor at a local assisted living facility, where her mother, Peggy, eventually comes to live after suffering a stroke. Some time later, Katherine encourages Debra to begin dating, and plans a double date with Chris, a friend of Terry's. Debra is initially impervious to Chris's advances, but the two become close quickly and marry after eight weeks of dating. Chris develops a close fatherly relationship with Jesse, now an adolescent. After several years, however, Debra and Chris's relationship deteriorates and she discovers he is having an affair. She confronts him before kicking him out of her home. One day, 11 years after Bridget went missing, Sergeant Morris arrives at Debra's work to notify her that a serial killer has led them to Bridget's remains, which they unearthed in a shallow grave. Debra goes to visit Bridget's killer in jail hoping to learn of her daughter's fate. Later, Sergeant Morris brings Debra and Jesse to the crime scene where Bridget's remains were discovered. Debra sobs, and lies in her daughter's shallow grave. Some time later, Debra decides to sell her house and move away with Jesse to start a new life. She has a garage sale which Chris visits. He tells her he still loves her, but Debra is not forthcoming to his advances and bids him goodbye. After the sale, Debra and Jesse say emotional goodbyes to Katherine, Terry, and Peggy, before driving away toward their new home. Cast Production In February 2017, it was announced Sienna Miller, Jacki Weaver, Aaron Paul and Christina Hendricks joined the cast of the film, with Jake Scott directing from a screenplay by Brad Ingelsby. Ridley Scott, Kevin J. Walsh and Michael Pruss will serve as producers under their Scott Free Productions banner, while Brad Feinstein will produce on behalf of Romulus Entertainment, which will also finance. Erika Olde will serve as an executive producer. In April 2017, Amy Madigan, Pat Healy, Ken Marino, Sky Ferreira, and Macon Blair joined the cast of the film. At the time, the project was titled The Burning Woman. Principal photography began in April 2017. Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2018. Shortly after, Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film. =Box office= The film was given a limited release in the United States on June 14, 2019, opening in 117 theaters. It debuted at number 26 at the U.S. box office, earning $110,552 its opening weekend. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 7.16/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"American Woman finds poignant drama in one woman's grueling odyssey, thanks in no small part to Sienna Miller's outstanding work in the leading role.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Glenn Kenny of The New York Times deemed the film a \\"working class character study,\\" adding: \\"The performances are excellent, and Ingelsby‚Äôs dialogue largely rings true. But while the movie is indeed considered and conscientious, it‚Äôs also careful. It doesn‚Äôt risk going over any edges itself.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Kimber Myers praised Miller's performance, writing: \\"At first, the bones of American Woman feel familiar, with its titular character‚Äôs sharp elbows pushing us away. We‚Äôve seen dramas led by brash women before; the one here is played by Sienna Miller, displaying more rage and range in a single film than some actresses get to show in their whole careers. But as the movie and its protagonist evolve, [it] at once reveals its soft underbelly while landing a surprisingly effective punch to the gut ‚Äî largely thanks to Miller‚Äôs deft performance.\\" Rex Reed, writing for The New York Observer, was laudatory of Miller's performance and the narrative development, noting that the film \\"catalogues years of pain that develop as naturally as fingerprints and culminates in the eventual revelation of what actually happened to Bridget, but American Woman is elevated beyond its woes by Miller‚Äôs galvanizing, astonishing and multi-dimensional centerpiece development of character. You can‚Äôt take your eyes off her because she has the extraordinary pace and timing to make you feel what she‚Äôs doing while she‚Äôs doing it, and you can‚Äôt wait for her to do more.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety was less praising of the film, writing that it \\"doesn‚Äôt evince a firm enough grasp on the rhythms of lower-middle-class life in Rust Belt Pennsylvania to compensate for the over-dependence on crisis melodrama in Brad Inglesby‚Äôs script. While offering some nice grace notes, the film feels too soap-operatic to meet the high bar of its more literary-minded pretensions. Unlikely to get the kind of critical support that would justify art-house exposure, it seems destined for quality cable sales.\\" The San Francisco Chronicles Carla Meyer described the film as \\"relentlessly downbeat,\\" and criticized it for its lack of focus on the disappearance of Debra's daughter: \\"Had the movie been more focused on Deb‚Äôs devastation over Bridget‚Äôs disappearance, Miller might have been great in it. She is quietly affecting when Deb steps away from whatever current romantic drama envelops her to remember her daughter.\\" References External links * Category:2018 films Category:2018 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:Films about missing people Category:Films set in Pennsylvania Category:Roadside Attractions films Category:Scott Free Productions films Category:Vertical Entertainment films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:Films directed by Jake Scott (director) ","title":"American Woman (2018 film)"},{"id":"54066181","text":"Peter Walden Milonni (born 5 May 1947) is an American theoretical physicist who deals with quantum optics, laser physics, quantum electrodynamics and the Casimir effect.

One of the stars of Bruneian football in the mid-nineties playing for the Brunei national representative team in the Malaysian league, he was a member of the 1999 Malaysia Cup winning side, deemed as Brunei's greatest footballing feat. Although his given name is Sadiy, it is often mistaken for Saidy or more frequently Said, which would become his default name in publications during his playing years. National career Said began playing for the Wasps in 1993 under English coach Mick Lyons. Perennial minnows at first (Brunei finished in last place in the inaugural 1994 Liga Perdana), Brunei improved on their league finish towards the end of the century, finishing an all-time high of third place in 1998. Said was part of the Brunei squad in 1999 to win the Malaysia Cup. It was to be his final year with the M-League team as he immediately retired from the team along with six other players. International career Said regularly played for the Brunei national football team at the Southeast Asian Games of the nineties, scoring five (known) goals. He scored twice in two defeats at the group stage of the 17th SEA Games held in Singapore in 1993, against Laos and Malaysia. Five years later in Indonesia, Said scored Brunei's solitary goal of the 19th SEA Games against Myanmar in a 1-6 defeat. When Brunei hosted the SEA Games in 1999, Said scored twice in Brunei's opening group stage match against Cambodia in a 3-3 draw. The point gained at the Berakas Sports Complex would ultimately be Brunei's only one for the tournament. Sadiy was a surprise inclusion for Brunei's 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign in early 2001, two years after his retirement from the national team.

He garnered popularity as one of the housemates of the Big Brother Naija 2017 reality game show; a localised franchise of the Dutch game show. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Lagos as well as a Statistician for the Federal Government. He is a baritone, known as Baritone Bally in the show. In 2015, Balat created an Afro infused electronic bootleg remix to Rihanna's hit song FourFiveSeconds, which brought industry recognition and led to a mash-up segment on Lagos city radio station; The Beat 99.9 FM.  Early life and career  Bally was born on (4 October 1988) in Kaduna State, the son of Paulina Yanakok and Isaiah Balat. He is from the Zangon-Kataf local government of Southern Kaduna. Growing up in a household with 3 music-loving elder, siblings played a huge role in crafting his music passion and style. He spent the majority of his adolescence in Kaduna before moving to Nigeria's capital; Abuja when he was 10 years old while also schooling in one of the most prestigious boarding schools in West Africa; Loyola Jesuit College. He began attending Purdue University in (2006), before transferring to the American University of Nigeria, after 2 years due to personal reasons. However, it was while still at Purdue University that Bally's love for music production and disc jockey began after befriending a fellow Nigerian rapper at his school. His rapper friend introduced him to the popular production software; FL Studio also known as Fruity Loops which Bally got really fond of and started trying his hand at music production. He then also decided to volunteer to disc jockey at different recreational spots in and around the Chicago area. This helped him hone his craft as a disc jockey as well as increase his confidence behind the turntables. After moving to the American University of Nigeria, Bally decided to take his passion for music even further becoming the popular go-to DJ not only within the University but also around town. He also was the only one with a music studio in his dorm in school therefore monopolising all music production and engineering done by students in campus at the same time raising capital to enable him buy more equipment. Having grown up on his elder siblings diverse record collection, from soulful 80s/90s Hip Hop & RnB to the higher tempo rhythmic progressions of Makossa, all infused with his own personal affinity for the more electronic synth sounds coming out of Europe at the time, Bally ended up with quite a mixed spectrum of musical influence. Today this translates into sets where he picks apart and infuses together all the pieces of this music that he loves best, transitioning seamlessly between genres, Late contemporary Afrobeats to electronic dance music, hip-hop, trap. = Music career = During his rise to fame, Balat got affiliated with a major record label in the Nigerian music industry; Aristokrat Records, the label responsible for bringing talented musician, Burna Boy to the limelight. Together, Balat and the label were able to produce some of the best Afro infused remixes and mash-ups to popular international hits around. He has officially released one single called \\"Ali\\" in (2015) featuring then label mate MoJeed and popular Abuja based rapper Sute. Bally is the genesis of a new breed of DJs coming out of Africa. A remarkable mixologist, he delves heavily in the production and engineering of mash-ups, remixes and original tracks mostly in the EDM genre. = DJ/Production Career = Bally began his musical journey while still in high school, creating playlists and arranging music for all major social events and parties. He however, bought his first set of turntables and began active disc jockey while at Purdue University. Along with his housemates, he became widely popular for organising parties all around campus as disc jockey for an eclectic mix of students with varying musical tastes. Since then he has held a number of club residencies around the world. A founding DJ of the Grotto Fashion Club in Abuja, Nigeria he progressed to a resident stint at the Gatecrasher club in Nottingham, while still touring the better part of the UK playing various gigs. He has also been called upon to play alongside some of the biggest names in Afrobeats music today. Over the last couple of years he has been honing his craft as a record producer, putting out a long array of music projects along the way. His goal has been to spearhead the EDM movement in Africa while at the same time doing his part in spreading the gospel of Afrobeats music to the rest of the world. Therefore, his mash-ups and remixes infuse both contemporary African rhythms and vocals with the piercing synth sounds of electronic dance music giving birth to a completely new refreshing high. His productions however, though geared towards certain genres still remain highly experimental, reminiscent of early Diplo. His mash-up series \\"Mash-Up Mondays\\" where he releases a brand new mash-up every Monday is currently hosted on The Beat 99.9 FM radio station during the Morning Rush show. = Acting = Bally delved into music and film almost at the same time while in secondary school and took part in various plays and dramas around campus. After completing his tertiary education he came back to Nigeria and enrolled at the Royal Arts Academy, Surulere, to attain formal training in Acting for both stage and film. With a series of short films under his belt including The Art of Deceit by Cynthia Toyo (2008), Baby Mama by Kudus and a few TV appearances guest-hosting The Late Show on COOL TV. = Big Brother Naija = In 2017, he went in as one of an eventual 14 housemates on the second season of the popular reality game show Big Brother Naija 2017 (formerly known as Big Brother Nigeria) finishing as the 5th runner-up. The show's high ratings and overwhelming popularity sprung Bally along with his other contesting housemates into instant stardom, becoming social media & real media heavyweights. The show also enabled him discover a fresh talent he never knew he had; his Husky Baritone Voice. His voice along with his trademark eyes and good looks got female audiences salivating. After a good run of surviving 9 weeks without ever being up for nomination he was eventually evicted in week 10 just one week shy of the grand finale. = Bally Rally Movement = The Bally Rally Movement began in 2017 while Bally was still in the Big Brother House. It was the name coined by his fans to signify their support and movement behind him. However, after he was eventually evicted from the house he came out to join the campaign revamping it into a social cause to promote peace and youth empowerment through music. The Bally Rally movement has since then been partitioned into two initiatives; \\"Bally Rally Out reach\\" and \\"Bally Rally Party\\". These two initiatives play out at various cities around the nation within 2 days. The Bally Rally Outreach comprises charity themed excursions to areas and institutions of lower social privilege such as Orphanage homes and IDP camps to provide aid and support as a way of giving back to society. The Bally Rally Party on the other hand occurs on the next day, which encompasses a mini carnival, & music concert featuring numerous games, food, drinks, merchandise sales and musical performances from artists and DJs alike.

C., U.S.A.), n√©e Hansom or Hanson, known throughout her career as Madame Ponisi, was an English-American actress. At an early age, she made her stage debut at Barnard Castle, Durham, England, as Amy in Father and Son. She made her London debut on December 26, 1848. In September 1850 she sailed for America under a three-month contract with E. A. Marshall, manager of the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and the Old Broadway Theatre in New York. She made her American debut October 7, 1850, at the former theater, as Marianne in The Wife, by James Sheridan Knowles. She played seven different roles in her first week, and then went to New York. Her debut there, at the Broadway Theatre, occurred on November 11, 1850, as Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal, with William Davidge. She was immediately invited to join the company to play leading roles. She stayed at the theater until its closing, April 2, 1859, on which occasion she played Cleopatra in Shakespeare's tragedy. She supported Edwin Forrest on a number of his starring tours. In 1864 Madame Ponisi made a short starring tour herself with Lady Macbeth as the feature of her repertory. She did not enjoy the roving life, however, and soon returned to New York, where she played special engagements until 1871, when she joined Lester Wallack's company, staying until it was disbanded in 1888. She subsequently acted with Joseph Jefferson and Richard Mansfield. In her youth she married James Ponisi, a professional actor, whom she divorced in 1856 or 1858. She married Samuel Wallis, the master mechanic of the Broadway Theatre, in 1859, who died in 1884. Her last appearance on any stage was April 6, 1893, when she emerged from retirement for a benefit to her friend and contemporary, Louisa Eldridge. Her roles included Tabitha Stork in Rosedale, Mrs. Malaprop in The Rivals, the Marquise in Caste, Suzanne in L'Abb√© Constantin, Helen Macgregor in Rob Roy, Mrs. Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer, Mrs. Cregan in The Colleen Bawn, Sarah Matheson in Patrie, Lady Franklin in Money, Widow O'Kelly in The Shaughraun, Lady Shendryn in Ours, Mrs. Macclesfield in The Gov'nor, the Marquise del Rio Zares in Diplomacy, Countess Pompion in Old Heads and Young Hearts, the Duchess in The Duke's Motto, Francesca da Rimini in George Henry Boker's tragedy of that name, Mrs. Vandam in Oofty-Gooft, Black Eyed Susan in the play of that name, the Duchess of York in Richard III, Desdemona and Emilia in Othello, Volumnia in Coriolanus, Cordelia in King Lear, and Juliet to Charlotte Cushman's Romeo, among others. She played several male characters, including Sir Edward Ardent in The Morning Call, and Romeo.

He is known for his discovery of repetitive, functional DNA sequences in bacteria which he named CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). These were later developed into the first widespread genome editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9.  Early life and education  Francisco Mojica was born in Elche, Spain, on October 5, 1963. Mojica attended Los Andes elementary school, V√°zquez de Mella school, and Instituto Carrus high school. Mojica enrolled first at the University of Murcia to study biology and later moved to the University of Valencia (BS, 1986) and University of Alicante (PhD, 1993). During his doctoral studies, he visited Paris-Sud University. He then received post-doctoral training at the University of Utah and the University of Oxford. Since 1994, Mojica has been a faculty member at the University of Alicante, were he has focused on molecular microbiology, which led to his discovery of the CRISPR system.  Career and research  =The discovery of CRISPR= Francisco Mojica was the first researcher to characterize what is now called a CRISPR locus, reported in 1993. Part of the sequence was reported previously by Yoshizumi Ishino in 1987. Mojica described the complete gene sequence repeats in the archaeal organisms Haloferax and Haloarcula species, and studied their function.Mojica, F.J., Juez, G. & Rodr√≠guez-Valera, F. (1993): Transcription at different salinities of Haloferax mediterranei sequences adjacent to partially modified PstI sites, Molecular Microbiology, Vol. 9, Nr. 3, page 613-621. He continued research on these sequences throughout the 1990s, and in 2000, Mojica recognized that what had been reported as disparate repeat sequences actually shared a common set of features, now known to be the hallmarks of CRISPR sequences. He coined the term CRISPR through correspondence with Ruud Jansen of Utrecht University, proposing the acronym of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in scientific literature. =CRISPR-Cas systems= In 2005 he published the first paper suggesting that CRISPR was an innate immune system from bacteria. This publication got rejected from 4 major scientific journals and was published 2 years later. This finding led him to hypothesize, correctly, that CRISPR is an adaptive immune system.

Biography He was born on 12 April 1679 in Aintab and started his religious vocation as a priest in 1706 in the Armenian Apostolic Church. In 1710 Ardzivian was ordained as the Armenian Orthodox Bishop of Aleppo by the Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia (the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia). After his conversion to Catholicism, he was persecuted, imprisoned and exiled, in different Ottoman prisons. In 1714, many Armenian converts to Catholicism decided to congregate independently under the leadership of Bishops Melkon Tazbazian and Abraham Ardzivian, with both being in prison. Tazbazian died in prison and Ardzivian, being liberated briefly was imprisoned again on Rouad Island from 1719 to 1721. After liberation and residing briefly in Aleppo, he took refuge in voluntary exile in Lebanon at Kreim, near Ghosta, Keserwan, Lebanon. The Armenian Catholic Mouradian brothers of Aleppo bought an estate to found an Armenian Catholic convent in Kreim where Ardzivian resided. He founded the Kreim convent and St-Antoine's Armenian Catholic Monks order. After two decades in Lebanon, he returned to his eparchy of Aleppo in 1739 after one year of the establishment of the eparchy in 1738. He was ordained Armenian Catholic Bishop of Aleppo by Greek Catholic bishops in 1739 and was declared the first Catholicos-Patriarch of the Armenian Catholic Church on November 26, 1740. This was ratified by Pope Benedict XIV after a meeting of the Cardinals in Rome on November 26, 1742. The Pope also granted him the Pallium. Upon his return, to Lebanon, he served as Catholicos-Patriarch aided by 6 clergy and a number of Armenian Catholic monks. He died on 1 October 1749. He was succeeded by Hagop Petros II Hovsepian.

In Sri Lanka, the formal TVET sector comprises about 635 public sector training centres and 718 private and NGO training centres. A large number of non-formal TVET providers also provide training in IT on a fee-for-service basis, and there is a widespread network of non-fee-levying institutions that are funded by various national and international charities. These providers educate people of all ages ‚Äî from secondary school leavers to working adults, parents and others who have suspended their education for various reasons and need training or retraining.  Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development (MYASD)  One of the principal architects of the Sri Lankan TVET system has been the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development (MYASD), which has overall responsibility for formulating national policies and implementing youth development programmes. MYASD encompasses 16 statutory bodies, including: * The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), which engages in policy development, planning, co- ordination and the development of tertiary and vocational education at all levels. It is responsible for the national system of granting TVET awards and maintaining academic and training standards in institutes, agencies and all other establishments providing tertiary and vocational education. * The University of Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC), which delivers 12 degree programmes, including a Bachelor of Education in Technology (BEd Tech) for teachers in the TVET sector; short-term training courses for TVET trainers and assessors; and curriculum, teaching and learning resources for TVET courses. * The Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET), which runs 38 technical colleges in all nine provinces and o ers certi cate and diploma courses in the technical education streams. * The Vocational Training Authority (VTA), which provides skills training for rural youth through a network of four National Vocational Training Institutes (NVTIs) and 14 District Vocational Training Centres (DVTCs) and around 210 Rural Vocational Training Centres (RVTCs). * The National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), which conducts island-wide training programmes for small-, medium- and large-scale enterprises and is responsible for the development and assessment of competency standards for the industrial training of TVET students. * The Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI), which is the foremost institute in Sri Lanka for the training of skilled technicians in the eld of automobile engineering and allied trades.  Qualifications and standards  TVEC, in association with the Skills Development Project (SDP) and with funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), developed the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) framework and National Competency Standards (NCS) in consultation with industry. The curricula, trainer guides, trainee guides and assessment resources are all based on these standards. Assessments are competency-based and the system is benchmarked against qualification systems in developed countries.  The Distance Education Modernisation Project  The use of distance learning, blended learning and eLearning is becoming more popular in Sri Lanka, and wider use of these methods makes it possible to ensure equal opportunities for initial and further training for all, regardless of place of residence or social and economic status. The catalyst for all this was the Distance Education Modernisation Project (DEMP), which was initiated by the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) in 2003 and aided by the ADB. The DEMP was created to establish a sustainable system of distance education and develop and deploy information and communication technologies (ICTs) to increase access to post-secondary education and improve the quality and relevance of the teaching and learning in specific institutions. With these objectives in mind, the DEMP initiated four projects: the Open University of Sri Lanka Capacity-Enhancement Project (OUSL-CE), Distance Education Partnership Programme (DEPP), Public Private Partnership Programme (PPP) and National Online Distance Education Service (NODES) and Network Access Centres (NACs).  The CG & C system  The CG & C operating model The solution to inculcating workplace-required attitudes and behaviours to help Sri Lankan youth transition into the world of work and stay in good jobs was seen to be the MYASD and TVEC co-developing a national Web-based CG & C system for the National Career Guidance and Counselling Centre and linking this to a network of careers guidance centres across the country. It was always recognised that while some of the socio-psychological matters identified could be addressed by the CG & C system, others might be beyond its scope and require more personal counselling. However, the overall aim of the CG & C system was to help individuals gain worthwhile employment that matched their training and qualifications and to help the country‚Äôs economic development by providing information about training options and pathways for them to follow, whether as employees, in self-employment or overseas.

In 1950, Tubeuf was received at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, , where he first followed the teaching of Michel Alexandre, himself a pupil of Alain, then that of Louis Althusser and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and enjoyed a friendship with G√©rard Granel. In 1951, with Maurice Clavel, he translated Electra by Sophocles for Silvia Monfort. An agr√©g√© in philosophy, he taught this subject in philosophy class and then in Classes pr√©paratoires litt√©raires (kh√¢gne) at the lyc√©e Fustel-de-Coulanges in Strasbourg, from 1957 to 1992.

After leaving China, McGrath continued his work with the Legion of Mary and with missionary activity in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the Philippines. Early life and priesthood McGrath was born in Drumcondra, Dublin on the 22 January 1906, to WIlliam a Barrister and Gertrude McGrath, both from County Down. He entered the Missionary Society of St. Columban (Maynooth Mission to China) and was ordained priest in 1929.

McGrath was removed by the Japanese during WWII, but in 1947 was commissioned to develop the lay apostolate through the Legion. His work was opposed by the communists who were at that time consolidating political control of the country. Over the following years, McGrath set up branches in Shanghai, Beijing, Tiensin, Canton, Kweiling, and Hongkong. He was working in Chunking when the Communists took control of that city and McGrath was prohibited from further action, although he then returned to Shanghai and continued his mission.Columban Father, Missionary To China, Will Speak Here, Great Bend Tribune (Great Bend, Kansas) April 1, 1966, page 15, accessed May 31, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11383547/ Imprisonment Following the Communist establishment of the People's Republic of China, in 1949, the Legion of Mary became a proscribed organisation.

Different forms of School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV) interact and overlap. Bullying, for instance, occurs when there is an imbalance of power between the ‚Äúbully‚Äù and the ‚Äúbullied‚Äù and can happen through physical contact, verbal attacks, social exclusion, and psychological manipulation. Students are bullied when they are repeatedly and intentionally exposed to harmful and/or aggressive behaviour that results in injury or discomfort.

Only 15.9% of the LGBT youth participants had a post-secondary school education, 47.8% had only a lower secondary education, 27.6% had only a primary school education, and 8.7% had no schooling at all. One study conducted by the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE) involving 2,363 respondents from 63 provinces in Viet Nam found that one in three respondents felt that they had been subject to discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity within 12 months preceding the survey, with a high degree of frequency.Luong,T.H.,&Pham;,Q,P.(2015).Is it because I am LGBT?: Discriminations on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Vietnam. Ha Noi: The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment. The study also reported that transgender people experience the highest degree of discrimination. This study focused its analysis on the discrimination experienced by LGBT people in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings and housing, among other aspects. Looking specifically at the school setting, the study found that nearly a quarter of students had been harassed, bullied by teachers and/or school officials because they were considered to be LGBT. Gender indicative uniforms proved to be a significant obstacle for transgender people, affecting their quality of learning and their mental health. In light of the findings, some recommendations specific to the education sector included: 1) School psychological counseling models need to pre-empt the psychological and physical development of students to provide well-timed educational support; 2) Create extracurricular programs that respond to the needs of students; 3) Respect students‚Äô choice of uniform to fit with their desired gender and; 4) Educate faculties about the LGBT community.

Plan International Viet Nam, in cooperation with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents (CSAGA), and the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), has implemented a ‚ÄúGender Responsive School Pilot Model project‚Äù meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received group counselling. The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.Plan International Viet Nam. (2016). Current situation of school-based violence in Ha Noi. Policy Dialogue on Ensuring Safe and Inclusive Education Environments in Viet Nam. 28 July 2016, Melia Hotel, Ha Noi.  Prevention  The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality was approved for the period 2011-2020 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socio-economic development of the country, including in education efforts towards this end. Furthermore, unlike many of its neighbours, Viet Nam now no longer has a ban on same-sex marriage, and has indeed never had punitive laws around either male or female same-sex relations.Marr, R. (2015). Vietnam Removes Same-Sex Marriage Ban. Metro Weekly. Retrieved from https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/01/ vietnam-removes-same-sex-marriage- Additionally, Viet Nam passed a landmark law by a vote of 282-84 in 2015 enshrining transgender people‚Äôs right to legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their sex rights for transgender people and paving the way to allow those who have undergone gender reassignment to register their legal identity under their new sex.Wee, D.
