Established in 1947 as WCCM, the station is owned by Costa-Eagle Radio Ventures, LP, a partnership between Pat Costa and the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune newspaper. WNNW airs a Spanish-language Tropical music format. WNNW's transmitter is off Chandler Road in Andover, Massachusetts. WNNW broadcasts at 3,000 watts by day. But because AM 800 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Mexico, WNNW must reduce power at night to 244 watts. It uses a non-directional antenna at all times. WNNW is also heard on FM translator W275BH at 102.9 MHz, which also uses the same Andover tower as the AM station.Radio-Locator.com/W275BH History The 800 kHz frequency in Lawrence first signed on the air in August 1947. Its call sign was WCCM and it was owned by Lawrence Broadcasting Company. An FM sister station, WGHJ at 93.7 MHz (today WEEI-FM) was launched in April 1960 as a full-time simulcast of WCCM. In 1963, WCCM and WGHJ were sold to noted sportscaster Curt Gowdy, who changed WGHJ's call letters to WCCM-FM that year. Both stations carried a full service middle of the road music format. In 1974, the simulcast ended. The FM station became WCGY, first airing a Top 40 format and later switching to album rock. WCCM continued on AM 800, with some talk and Spanish programming. As younger people switched to FM for their music, WCCM flipped to adult standards. After Curt Gowdy sold WCGY to American Radio Systems in 1994, WCCM was put up for sale. However, a buyer was not found until 1997, when newspaper publisher Costa-Eagle agreed to purchase the station. Soon after taking over a year later, Costa-Eagle shifted the station from adult standards to full service adult contemporary. The following year, WCCM began marketing itself to the Lowell area, after WLLH (1400 AM) was sold and converted to Spanish- language programming. WCCM opened a Lowell studio and hired several former WLLH personalities including news anchor Bob Ellis. It began carrying Lowell Spinners baseball, which had previously aired on WLLH. WCCM also began shifting back to standards, replacing satellite talk programming from Talk America with the \\"Music of Your Life Network\\" a few months later. The Lowell studio was closed in 2002 after the station gradually phased out its use. WCCM also ended out much of its music programming, with local talk shows during the day and sports radio programming from ESPN Radio during evenings, nights, and weekends. The station was assigned the WNNW call letters on August 29, 2002. It was part of a larger shuffle that resulted in WNNW moving its Spanish tropical format from 1110 AM and WCCM moving to 1490 AM, taking WHAV off-the- air in favor of WCEC, which took over 1110 AM with WHAV's former programming. The changes formally took effect on-air that September. In 2008, owner Pat Costa received Radio Ink Magazine's Medallas de Cortez Award for General Manager of the Year. Later that year, Costa-Eagle purchased W275BH, a construction permit for an FM translator at 102.9 MHz in Newton, New Hampshire. Costa-Eagle moved it to 92.1 FM in Lawrence in 2009 (thereby changing its call letters to W221CH). It signed on that March as a simulcast of WNNW. In June 2011, the translator was moved to 102.9 FM (reclaiming the W275BH call letters) due to interference complaints from WFEX in Derry, New Hampshire and WPHX-FM in Sanford, Maine.

All of these objects were strong sources of ultraviolet radiation, so they ionised the material surrounding them. The structure of this reionisation reflects the overall density structure at the redshift of luminous-object formation. Overview PaST will consist an array of some ten-thousand log-periodic antennas spread over several square kilometers. It will capture a detailed radio image of the sky in the range of 1420 megahertz. The telescope is built on the high plateau of Ulastai in the west of Xinjiang province, a remote area away from most television and radios signals that may interfere the weak 21 cm background signals. The hydrogen line, 21 centimeter line or HI line refers to the electromagnetic radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation is at the precise frequency of 1420.40575177 MHz, which is equivalent to the vacuum wavelength of 21.10611405413 cm in free space. This wavelength or frequency falls within the microwave radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is observed frequently in radio astronomy, since those radio waves can penetrate the large clouds of interstellar cosmic dust that are opaque to visible light. The microwaves of the hydrogen line come from the atomic transition between the two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen 1s ground state with an energy difference of 5.87433 ¬µeV.[1] The frequency of the quanta that are emitted by this transition between two different energy levels is given by Planck's equation.

(Jacopo Nacchianti, Naclantus) (born 1502 at Florence; died at Chioggia, 6 May 1569) was an Italian Dominican theologian who served as Bishop of Chioggia (1544-1569). Early Biography Giacomo Nacchiante was born in Florence, Italy. He was placed by his father under the protection of the superintendent of the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence's foundling hospital, in 1509. Formation Nacchiante joined the Dominican Order at the convent of San Marco, in Florence. He studied at Bologna, where Michael Ghislieri, afterwards Pope Pius V, was his fellow-student. Career In 1541 Nacchiante was appointed professor of philosophy and theology at the Roman studium of the Dominican Order at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, which had developed out of the studium provinciale at Santa Sabina, and which would later develop into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum.Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 10, 1911, p. 667. https://books.google.com/books?id=zbdAAQAAIAAJ&pg;=PA667&lpg;=#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Accessed 6-2-2011 Pope Paul III, struck with his talents, made him Bishop of Chioggia (30 January 1544). At the Council of Trent he made a vigorous protest against the words of the decree of the IV Session (8 April 1546), which asserts that the traditions of the Church are to be received with the same reverence and piety as the Scriptures; but he gave assent to the decree, when he saw it confirmed by the assembly. Further serious suspicions of his orthodoxy seem afterwards to have arisen, and the papal secretary at the Council of Trent, Angelo Massarelli, undertook an Inquisition. The records of the parallel Venetian Inquisition of Nacchiante's orthodoxy can be found in the Venetian state archives. As Pallavicini remarks, Pope Pius IV assigned to him grave affairs of trust, and he returned to the second and third sessions of the Council of Trent as a full participant in the Council's debates.

It would be served by trains from the west of Leeds which would normally terminate at Leeds station; by continuing eastwards to this station, it is hoped that extra capacity for through trains would be created at Leeds. The station would also form the first phase of electrifying the railway line to the east of Leeds. As a parkway station (an early name was East Leeds Parkway), the intention would be to allow for a park-and-ride service and the plans include parking for 500 cars. ¬£20 million was allocated to the scheme by the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Transport Board in April 2008. It was originally hoped that construction would begin in 2011, with a completion date of 2012, but the business case was not submitted to the Department for Transport until 2011. The scheme was put on hold due to a lack of central government funding. The station is likely to be made up of 2 island platforms, capable of serving inter-city trains. The station also featured in plans by Alliance Rail as a stopping point for services between Ilkley/Bradford Forster Square and London Kings Cross to begin in 2017. However in May 2016, the Office of Rail and Road rejected Alliance Rail's plans to runs services under its GNER banner. The proposals for East Leeds Parkway have been downplayed in favour of an alternative site at Thorpe Park (which is further west). The West Yorkshire Combined Authority has stated that it is to review the options because of the lack of clarity over the Northern Powerhouse enhancement would mean that only stopping trains (operated by Northern) would stop at any future site. In November 2017, the ‚ÄòConnecting People: Strategic Vision for Rail‚Äô Report by the Government proposed a new station in Thorpe Park as part of a plan to reverse the Beeching Cuts.

They form the natural boundary between the canton's Toggenburg and Sarganserland districts. They are the southernmost range of the Appenzell Alps, separated from the Glarus Alps by the Seez river and Lake Walen. They consist of a limestone ridge running east to west, with the individual peaks formed by erosion. The ridge is defined much more sharply to the south than to the north, with an almost vertical drop of several hundred meters towards Walenstadtberg and eventually Lake Walen at 419 m. The southern slope of the range was significantly formed by the Rhine Glacier during the W√ºrm glaciation. The name is a plural, indicating the peaks forming the historical boundary of the bishopric of Chur. It has historically also been folk- etymologized as Kurf√ºrsten, i.e. the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire who in the later medieval period (until 1648) numbered seven, which in turn encouraged the count of seven main or \\"official\\" peaks.Schweizerisches Idiotikon, s.v. \\"First\\" .

Since 1965 the palace has housed a museum dedicated to Polish sculptor Xawery Dunikowski. History Catherina Gattai Thomatis, mistress to King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski The palace is named for its former function as a rabbit warren for Poland's King Augustus II the Strong (reigned 1697‚Äì1706 and 1709‚Äì33). The Kr√≥likarnia was erected on the picturesque Wis≈Ça River escarpment between 1782 and 1786 for King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski's Theatre Entrepreneur and Chamberlain, Charles Thomatis, Count de Val√©ry, by royal architect Domenico Merlini. It was modeled after the famous Renaissance- era Villa Rotonda outside Vicenza, Italy, designed by Andrea Palladio. On his estate, the Count established a brewery, brickyard, inn, mill, barn, and garden with vineyard. Thomatis has also been described as a pimp for King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (reigned 1764‚Äì95); and the Count's \\"villa at Kr√≥likarnia [as] little more than a high-class brothel\\". In 1794, during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, the insurrection's leader Tadeusz Kosciuszko resided in the palace. In 1816 the estate was purchased by Micha≈Ç Hieronim Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, and in 1849 by Ksawery Pus≈Çowski, a passionate art collector. In 1879 the palace was partly destroyed by fire, and shortly afterward was rebuilt for the Pus≈Çowski family by J√≥zef Huss. During World War II, in 1939 and 1945, the Kr√≥likarnia was completely destroyed by German bombardments. In 1964 it was rebuilt to house a collection of sculptures by Xawery Dunikowski, and now houses the Xawery Dunikowski Museum of Sculpture, opened in 1965. The Museum is a branch of the National Museum in Warsaw. It also organizes temporary exhibits of art by Polish and foreign contemporary artists.

Only ruins survive, which are well known as a frequent subject of Caspar David Friedrich's paintings, including the famous Abtei im Eichwald (\\"Abbey in the Oak Forest\\").  History  = Monastery = In the 12th century the Baltic coast south of the island of R√ºgen belonged to the Rani principality of R√ºgen, which in its turn was subject to the Danes. The Danish Cistercian monastery, Esrum Abbey, was thus able to found a daughter house in the area, Dargun Abbey, at Dargun, west of Demmin, in 1172. When in 1198 this monastery was destroyed in fighting between Denmark and Brandenburg, Jaromar I, Prince of the Rani, whose wife was of the Danish royal house, offered to re-settle the monks at a new site at the mouth of the River Ryck, close to the boundary between the territory of the Princes of R√ºgen, and the County of G√ºtzkow,Christian L√ºbke, Struktur und Wandel im Fr√ºh- und Hochmittelalter: eine Bestandsaufnahme aktueller Forschungen zur Germania Slavica, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1998, p.305, since the early 1120s subordinate to the Duchy of Pomerania. The offer of the site, which included profitable salt pans, was accepted, and in 1199 Hilda Abbey, now Eldena Abbey, \\"Hilda\\" was the original name of the locality now known as Eldena, and now part of Greifswald, to which the monastery was very close was founded, and confirmed by Pope Innocent III in 1204.the foundation legend, based on the apparent meaning of the name \\"Greifswald\\" (\\"griffin's wood\\"), was that the monks were shown the site of the monastery by a griffin living in a tree growing in the future high street of Greifswald The princes of R√ºgen further endowed the new monastery with extensive lands in the border country between the R√ºgen-owned territories of Gristow and Wostrose (Wusterhusen), the area of Lositz (Loitz) which was debated between R√ºgen and Mecklenburg, and the County of G√ºtzkow. The monastery became wealthy from the salt trade and was very influential in the Christianisation of Western Pomerania. It also brought about the foundation at the beginning of the 13th century of the town of Greifswald, which started out as the monastery's trading settlement opposite the salt pans, near the point where the via regia, an important trade route, crossed the river. After the Battle of Bornh√∂ved in 1227 the Danes withdrew from this part of their former territories, and despite some competition from the princes of R√ºgen, the Duke of Pomerania, Wartislaw III, was able in 1248/49 to pressurise the abbey into subinfeudating Greifswald to him. Wartislaw was later buried in Eldena Abbey, as were later members of the ducal family, the House of Pomerania. Wartislaw III and later members of the ducal family Throughout the 13th century, Eldena Abbey organized the cultivation and settlement of its growing estates in the Ostsiedlung process, allocating and founding Wendish, Danish and German villages.Christian L√ºbke, Struktur und Wandel im Fr√ºh- und Hochmittelalter: eine Bestandsaufnahme aktueller Forschungen zur Germania Slavica, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1998, pp. 308‚Äì310, In the growing town of Greifswald however, the Cistercians of Eldena lost much of their influence the foundation in the town in the mid-13th century of friaries of the Franciscans (Greyfriars) and the Dominicans (Blackfriars). The east end of the abbey church was built in about 1200, while the conventual buildings date from the mid-13th and 14th centuries, all in Brick Gothic. The final stages of construction were the west front and the nave of the church, which were completed in the 15th century. = Dissolution and later history = The abbey was dissolved in 1535, when the Reformation was introduced into Pomerania by Duke Philip I, who took over its estates. The buildings were severely damaged during the Thirty Years' War. In 1634 the site was given to the University of Greifswald. The buildings fell derelict during the Swedish occupation of western Pomerania (1648‚Äì1815), and bricks were taken away to build fortifications. Caspar David Friedrich: Abtei im Eichwald (1809-10), based on the ruins of Eldena Abbey By the beginning of the 19th century, when the Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich knew the abbey, it was a ruin, which he made the subject of several paintings. Renewed public interest led to the beginning of restoration work in 1828, and on the basis of designs by the Prussian landscape gardener Peter Joseph Lenn√© a park was laid out on the abbey precinct. In 1926-1927, scientific excavations were carried out in order to reconstruct the exact layout of the site. In the 1960s further work was carried out to make the site suitable for use for public and cultural events. Still more works were authorised from 1996 onwards jointly by both the State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments (Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege) and the town of Greifswald, which eventually led to the declaration of the ruins as a cultural site of the Pomerania Euroregion.

It further suggested that perhaps, in light of the recent bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \\"it would be more appropriate to name the local bankruptcy court or a consumer credit counseling center after Bush.\\" Result Despite some journalists forecasting a victory as \\"likely\\" based on the heavily liberal political tendencies of San Francisco, Proposition R fell well short of the simple majority needed for its passage, with only 30.25% of voters in favor overall and no more than 37% voting yes in any of San Francisco's eleven supervisorial districts.

Located on one of the highest elevations within the city, the park surrounds a reservoir used to provide water for many of the city's residents.  History  James P. Kirkwood selected the site of the reservoir, one of the highest elevations within the 1855 city limits. As the reservoir occupied only of the site, Kirkwood suggested the remaining land be turned into a park. The top of the reservoir structure was at one time covered with elevated tennis courts; presently, two newer tennis courts lie to the east. The water tower was retired in 1929, after 30 years, when the Howard Bend Plant was put in service: the static head from the Stacy Park Reservoir, in what is now the St. Louis suburb of Olivette, caused an overflow of pure chemically treated water into the sewer system. The reservoir and water tower were renovated, in 1999, at a cost of $19 million. In 1969, Interstate 44 was constructed through the northern edge of the park, reducing the area of the park to its present size.  Compton Hill Water Tower  Compton Hill Water Tower under scaffolding during construction, 1899. The Compton Hill Water Tower, built in 1898, is the youngest of three remaining stand pipe-water towers in St. Louis. Whereas, in 1901, more than 423 stand pipe style water towers existed in the United States, as of 2008 only about a dozen remain standing, three of which are in St. Louis (the other two being the Bissell Tower and the Grand Avenue Water Tower). The tower was built to disguise a diameter, tall standpipe in its interior. The standpipe helped to control the dangerous surges in the city's pipes caused by the reciprocating pumps and maintain an even water pressure. The water tower was designed by Harvey Ellis who also had a hand in designing the headhouse for St. Louis Union Station. Occasionally, the observation deck at the top of the water tower is opened to the public, allowing visitors to see 360-degree panoramic views of the city. The Compton Hill Water Tower was declared a city landmark in 1966 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Naked Truth The statue The Naked Truth was presented in honor of the local German American press The statue The Naked Truth, unveiled in 1914, was a gift to the city of St. Louis by the German- American Alliance in honor of Carl Schurz, Emil Preetorius and Carl Daenzer, editors of the German St. Louis newspaper Westliche Post. Controversy erupted over the statue's nudity before the monument was even built when a jury selected the design of Wilhelm Wandschneider, the only non-local sculptor in the design contest. At the request of Adolphus Busch, who had contributed $20,000 of the $31,000 cost of the monument, the statue was made of bronze instead of white marble to deemphasize the nudity. The statue was moved to its present location south of the water tower after Interstate 44 was constructed through the northern edge of the park. The statue was designated a city landmark in 1969.

It can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively, a state known as heart failure, with accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) or legs (peripheral edema). Most heart failure in people with diabetes results from coronary artery disease, and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is no coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder. Signs and symptoms One particularity of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the long latent phase, during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic. In most cases, diabetic cardiomyopathy is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease. One of the earliest signs is mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with little effect on ventricular filling. Also, the diabetic patient may show subtle signs of diabetic cardiomyopathy related to decreased left ventricular compliance or left ventricular hypertrophy or a combination of both. A prominent ‚Äúa‚Äù wave can also be noted in the jugular venous pulse, and the cardiac apical impulse may be overactive or sustained throughout systole. After the development of systolic dysfunction, left ventricular dilation and symptomatic heart failure, the jugular venous pressure may become elevated, the apical impulse would be displaced downward and to the left. Systolic mitral murmur is not uncommon in these cases. These changes are accompanied by a variety of electrocardiographic changes that may be associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy in 60% of patients without structural heart disease, although usually not in the early asymptomatic phase. Later in the progression, a prolonged QT interval may be indicative of fibrosis. Given that diabetic cardiomyopathy's definition excludes concomitant atherosclerosis or hypertension, there are no changes in perfusion or in atrial natriuretic peptide levels up until the very late stages of the disease, when the hypertrophy and fibrosis become very pronounced. Pathophysiology Defects in cellular processes such as autophagy and mitophagy are thought to contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized functionally by ventricular dilation, enlargement of heart cells, prominent interstitial fibrosis and decreased or preserved systolic function in the presence of a diastolic dysfunction. While it has been evident for a long time that the complications seen in diabetes are related to the hyperglycemia associated to it, several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Etiologically, four main causes are responsible for the development of heart failure in diabetic cardiomyopathy: microangiopathy and related endothelial dysfunction, autonomic neuropathy, metabolic alterations that include abnormal glucose use and increased fatty acid oxidation, generation and accumulation of free radicals, and alterations in ion homeostasis, especially calcium transients. =Microangiopathy= Microangiopathy can be characterized as subendothelial and endothelial fibrosis in the coronary microvasculature of the heart. This endothelial dysfunction leads to impaired myocardial blood flow reserve as evidence by echocardiography. About 50% of diabetics with diabetic cardiomyopathy show pathologic evidence for microangiopathy such as sub- endothelial and endothelial fibrosis, compared to only 21% of non-diabetic heart failure patients. Over the years, several hypotheses were postulated to explain the endothelial dysfunction observed in diabetes. It was hypothesized that the extracellular hyperglycemia leads to an intracellular hyperglycemia in cells unable to regulate their glucose uptake, most predominantly, endothelial cells. Indeed, while hepatocytes and myocytes have mechanisms allowing them to internalize their glucose transporter, endothelial cells do not possess this ability. The consequences of increased intracellular glucose concentration are fourfold, all resulting from increasing concentration of glycolytic intermediates upstream of the rate-limiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate reaction which is inhibited by mechanisms activated by increased free radical formation, common in diabetes. Four pathways, enumerated below all explain part of the diabetic complications. First, it has been widely reported since the 1960s that hyperglycemia causes an increase in the flux through aldose reductase and the polyol pathway. Increased activity of the detoxifying aldose reductase enzyme leads to a depletion of the essential cofactor NADH, thereby disrupting crucial cell processes. Second, increasing fructose 6-phosphate, a glycolysis intermediate, will lead to increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. This produces N-acetyl glucosamine that can add on serine and threonine residues and alter signaling pathways as well as cause pathological induction of certain transcription factors. Third, hyperglycemia causes an increase in diacylglycerol, which is also an activator of the Protein Kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Induction of PKC causes multiple deleterious effects, including but not limited to blood flow abnormalities, capillary occlusion and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Finally, glucose, as well as other intermediates such as fructose and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, when present in high concentrations, promote the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). These, in turn, can irreversibly cross link to proteins and cause intracellular aggregates that cannot be degraded by proteases and thereby, alter intracellular signalling. Also, AGEs can be exported to the intercellular space where they can bind AGE receptors (RAGE). This AGE/RAGE interaction activates inflammatory pathways such as NF-Œ∫B, in the host cells in an autocrine fashion, or in macrophages in a paracrine fashion. Neutrophil activation can also lead to NAD(P)H oxidase production of free radicals further damaging the surrounding cells. Finally, exported glycation products bind extracellular proteins and alter the matrix, cell-matrix interactions and promote fibrosis. A major source of increased myocardial stiffness is crosslinking between AGEs and collagen. In fact, a hallmark of uncontrolled diabetes is glycated products in the serum and can be used as a marker for diabetic microangiopathy. =Autonomic neuropathy= While the heart can function without help from the nervous system, it is highly innervated with autonomic nerves, regulating the heart beat according to demand in a fast manner, prior to hormonal release. The autonomic innervations of the myocardium in diabetic cardiomyopathy are altered and contribute to myocardial dysfunction. Unlike the brain, the peripheral nervous system does not benefit from a barrier protecting it from the circulating levels of glucose. Just like endothelial cells, nerve cells cannot regulate their glucose uptake and suffer the same type of damages listed above. Therefore, the diabetic heart shows clear denervation as the pathology progresses. This denervation correlates with echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction and results in a decline of survival in patients with diabetes from 85% to 44%. Other causes of denervation are ischemia from microvascular disease and thus appear following the development of microangiopathy. Diagnosis Treatment At present, there is no effective specific treatment available for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Treatment centers around intense glycemic control through diet, oral hypoglycemics and frequently insulin and management of heart failure symptoms. There is a clear correlation between increased glycemia and risk of developing diabetic cardiomyopathy, therefore, keeping glucose concentrations as controlled as possible is paramount. Thiazolidinediones are not recommended in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure secondary to fluid retention. As with most other heart diseases, ACE inhibitors can also be administered. An analysis of major clinical trials shows that diabetic patients with heart failure benefit from such a therapy to a similar degree as non-diabetics. Similarly, beta blockers are also common in the treatment of heart failure concurrently with ACE inhibitors.

Pahari paintings, as the name suggests, were paintings executed in the hilly regions of India, in the sub-Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh.\\"Kangra Painting\\" https://www.auchitya.com/kangra- painting-delicate-and-lyrical-style/ It is in the development and modification of Pahari paintings, that the Kangra School features. Under the patronage of Maharaja Sansar Chand (c.1765-1823), it became the most important center of Pahari painting. To see some of these master pieces one can visit the Maharaja Sansar Chand Museum, adjoining the Kangra Fort in Kangra Himachal. This museum has been founded by the erst-while Royal Family of Kangra. History Sansar Chand (c.1765-1823), an early patron of the Kangra style This great art originated in Guler State, a small hill state in the Lower Himalayas in the first half of the 18th century when a family of Kashmiri painters trained in Mughal painting Style sought shelter at the court of Raja Dalip Singh (r. 1695-1741) of Guler. The rise of Guler Paintings started in what is known as the Early phase of Kangra Kalam. The new arrivals mingled with the local artists and were greatly influenced by the atmosphere of the hills. Instead of painting flattering portraits of their masters and love scenes, the artistes adopted themes of eternal love between Radha and Krishna. The paintings were naturalistic and employed cool, fresh colors. The colors were extracted from minerals, vegetables and possessed enamel-like luster. Verdant greenery of the landscape, brooks, springs were the recurrent images on the miniatures. Nainsukh (1710-1778), succeeded by two generations of his family workshop, introduced a distinctive style which combined Mughal elements with personal innovations. This style reached its zenith during the reign of Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch (r.1776-1824) who was a great patron of Kangra art. Being a liberal patron, the painters working at his atelier received large commissions while others accepted a permanent settlement in the form of lands. Maharaja Sansar Chand was an ardent devotee of Krishna and used to commission artists to paint subjects based on the loves and life of Krishna. The Guler-Kangra art is the art of drawing and the drawing is precise and fluid, lyrical and naturalistic. In these styles the faces are well modelled and shaded so judiciously that they possess almost porcelain-like delicacy. Themes The focal theme of Kangra painting is Shringar (the erotic sentiment). The subjects seen in Kangra painting exhibit the taste and the traits of the life style of the society of that period. Bhakti cult was the driving force and the love story of Radha and Krishna was the main source of spiritual experience, which was also the base for the visual expression. Bhagavata Purana and the love poems Gita Govinda by Jayadeva were the most popular subjects dealing with the legends and the amorous plays of Radha and Krishna symbolising soul‚Äôs devotion to God. In some miniatures, the blue-god Krishna is seen dancing in the lush woodlands and every maiden‚Äôs eye are drawn to him. Krishna subjects, known commonly as Krishna-lila predominate, while the themes of love, inspired by the nayaks and nayikas and baramasa enjoyed great favour. The sentiment of love remained the inspiration and the central theme of Pahari painting. The Sat Sai depictions of the legendary lovers, on the other hand, were set against an architectural background with walls, balconies and windows. Kangra paintings influenced by the Bhagavad Purana portrayed incidents from the life of the young Krishna, against the Brindavan forest or river Yamuna. The other popular themes were the stories of Nala and Damayanti, and those from Keshavdas's Baramasa. Features of Kangra painting Rama and Sita in the forest, 1780 One striking feature of Kangra paintings is the verdant greenery it depicts. The style is naturalistic, and great attention is paid to detail. The foliage depicted is vast and varied. This is made noticeable by using multiple shades of green. The Kangra paintings feature flowering plants and creepers, leafless trees, rivulets and brooks. The Kangra artists adopted various shades of the primary colors and used delicate and fresher hues. For instance, they used a light pink on the upper hills to indicate distance. Kangra paintings depict the feminine charm in a very graceful manner. Facial features are soft and refined. The female figures are exceptionally beautiful. A regal figure seated on a throne, Pahari school Later Kangra paintings also depicted nocturnal scenes, and storms and lightning. The paintings were often large and had complex compositions of many figures and elaborate landscapes. Towns and house clusters were often depicted in the distance. The Kangra painters used colors made of vegetable and mineral extracts. They employed cool and fresh colors. Kangra paintings are known for the lyrical blending of form and color. The Kangra Arts Promotion Society() an NGO at Dharamshala Himachal Pradesh is working for the promotion of this art which is at the verge of extinction today. This NGO is running a school to train young boys and girls in this art. It also runs a workshop where genuine Kangra Paintings are made on traditional handmade paper using only mineral and vegetable colours.

She was previously known as SS Maritzburg and SS Mendoza, and was later renamed SS Venezuela. Launched in 1904 as Maritzburg for the Bucknall Line, the ship was sold to Lloyd Italiano in 1905 and renamed Mendoza. Renamed Caserta in 1914, she was placed under the Navigazione Generale Italiana banner in 1918. During World War I she was employed as a troopship carrying United States troops to France as part of the United States Navy Cruiser and Transport Force. In 1923, she was renamed Venezuela and transferred to La Veloce for South American service, but reverted to NGI control in 1924. She was scrapped in 1928. Early career SS Maritzburg, an ocean liner with a , was built in 1904 by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth and Company of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Sailing for the Bucknall Line during her first year of operation, the liner was sold in 1905 to Lloyd Italiano and renamed SS Mendoza. Mendoza completed one trip to New York in January 1908, and two trips in September and October 1909.Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 130, 138. For the next two years, she began service to New York in May and continued through December. Beginning in May 1912, Mendoza began year-round service on the New York route, sailing opposite .Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 146, 161, 170 In 1914, the ship was renamed SS Caserta after the city of Caserta, Italy, and continued New York service opposite Taormina.Immigration Information Bureau, p. 179. In May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, and ships from New York to Italy often carried Italian immigrants returning to fight for their homeland. One voyage of Caserta was typical; she sailed from New York on 1 November carrying some 1,200 men, nearly all of whom were, according to an article in The New York Times, reservists of the Italian Army. Before her 1 February 1916 arrival in New York, Caserta had been armed with two guns mounted on her after deckhouse, and manned by two gunners mates and two assistants. Caserta had been escorted by Italian Navy torpedo boats until she reached Gibraltar. The gunners practiced from Gibraltar to the Azores by shooting at submarine-like targets‚Äîbutter barrels, which had been equipped with a stick, painted gray, and tossed from the bow of the ship. Caserta, by this time the only Lloyd Italiano ship sailing to New York, completed two more roundtrips to New York before Italy joined the war against Germany in August 1916. Caserta completed two more New York roundtrips before the end of the year.Immigration Information Bureau, p. 189. Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917. Lloyd Italiano did not have any U.S. passenger service that year, and Casertas activities in 1917 are unknown.Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 191‚Äì92.  U.S. Troopship service  Beginning in May 1918, Caserta was chartered as a United States troop transport and attached to the United States Navy Cruiser and Transport Force.Gleaves, p. 240. (Page 240 shows the date as \\"July 1, 1916\\", but is wrong. See p. 102 for a description of the appendices with the correct date of \\"July 1, 1918\\" listed.) Caserta departed New York 10 May 1918 on the first of five convoy voyages to Europe before the war's end‚Äîcarrying elements of the U.S. 47th Infantry Division, who called her a \\"cattle boat\\"‚Äîand accompanied by U.S. Navy transports , , , UK troopship , and Italian steamship .

American cruiser served as escort for the assembled ships, which were the 35th U.S. convoy of the war.Crowell and Wilson, p. 609. On 20 May, the convoy sighted and fired on a \\"submarine\\" that turned out to be a bucket; the next day escort Frederick left the convoy after being relieved by nine destroyers. Three days later the convoy sighted land at 06:30 and anchored at Brest that afternoon.Pollard, p. 27. Casertas next convoy left Newport News on 23 June and consisted of the Italian steamship Duca d'Aosta, , the French , and American transports and Susquehanna. Accompanied by , , , , and , the convoy reached France on 5 July. Caserta returned to Virginia on 21 July with Re d'Italia.Crowell and Wilson, p. 611.

Casertas convoy was escorted by Frederick and Colhoun.Crowell and Wilson, p. 616. At 20:00 on 7 October, Caserta departed New York on her fifth Navy voyage with 1,577 men‚Äîincluding parts of the Twenty-ninth Engineers‚Äîand joined Kroonland and UK steamship Euripides in rendezvousing with , Susquehanna, America, and UK troopship from Newport News.29th Engineers: Black, p. 118.

Cruisers and , and destroyers and Fairfax served as convoy escorts for the group, which arrived in France on 20 October. Caserta headed back to New York, arriving there on 9 November.Crowell and Wilson, p. 618. After the Armistice, Caserta was employed to return troops to the United States. In February 1919, she carried home 1,500 American troops, including the entire 63rd Artillery, Coastal Artillery Corps. John Brown, a private in the 63rd Artillery kept a diary in which he described his journey home aboard Caserta in February 1919. Departing from Marseille in the evening of 6 February, the transport arrived at Gibraltar three days later, where she anchored to wait for a load of coal for the journey home. After four days, the ship was underway, but again delayed near the Azores by storms in the Atlantic. Meals on board Caserta during the trip were not necessarily to the liking of the troops. Twice-a-day servings of \\"spaghetti, macaroni, or noodles\\" were interrupted only occasionally by non-pasta meals, such as chicken in honor of Washington's Birthday, on 22 February. The liner, nicknamed the \\"Macaroni Barge\\" by the American troops, eventually reached New York on 27 February.Brown, entries for 6‚Äì27 February. Also on board Caserta was 60-year-old Private Robert W. Louden of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Louden, a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Mexican Expedition, was wounded twice in fighting in France. Contemporary news accounts called him the \\"oldest American to go through the war\\". Another passenger on board was Sultan, a former German messenger dog adopted by two U.S. Army captains when they found him in an abandoned German trench near Verdun. Caserta sailed for Gibraltar and Italy on 6 March. Caserta made at least one more voyage with American troops when she sailed from Marseille to New York on 22 April.Morse, p. 82. Among the 1,500 troops on board when the liner docked in New York on 8 May, were nearly 550 men from the 7th, 50th (\\"Dutch Girl\\"), 650th and 658th Aero Squadrons; the 50th Aero Squadron had located the \\"Lost Battalion\\" in October 1918.Troops: 50th Aero Squadron: Morse, p. 9.  Later career  When Caserta resumed regular passenger service in 1919, she began sailing under the Navigazione Generale Italiana (NGI) banner; NGI, which previously had a controlling interest in Lloyd Italiano, took over completely in 1918. Caserta resumed New York service in July, which she continued, with occasional calls at Philadelphia, through the end of 1921.Immigration Information Bureau, pp. 197, 200, 205. In 1923, Caserta was renamed Venezuela and transferred to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana a Vapore, commonly known as La Veloce, for service between Italy and South America. Transferred back to NGI in 1924, the liner was scrapped in 1928.

La Rocca scored his first goal for Western Sydney Wanderers on 18 November 2012 in just his second game, to defeat Perth Glory. In February 2013, he signed a new two-year deal with the Wanderers. On 23 March, La Rocca was sent off in the last minute of stoppage time in the third Sydney Derby of the season for elbowing Sydney midfielder Terry Antonis in the temple. The subsequent ban meant La Rocca missed the semifinal and the final. His club nonetheless won the title in their debut season.

It is in the local government area of the City of Frankston (app. 45km South East from the Melbourne CBD) History European settlement of the area now known as Karingal is recorded as far back as the 1840s. Agricultural and pastoral land use continued in the area into the 1960s, when residential development spread from Frankston East into this locality. As this part of Frankston was subdivided and developed (largely as an AV Jennings housing estate), it was dubbed \\"Karingal\\", a Koori word which translates as \\"happy home\\" or \\"happy camp\\". During this time, the Karingal Post Office opened on 1 April 1964. =Ballam Park homestead= The \\"Ballam Ballam\\" estate was home to prominent early settlers of the Frankston area, the Liardets. Frank Liardet, son of early hotelier and artist Wilbraham Liardet, established the property in 1854.Jones, Michael. Frankston: Resort to City. Allen & Unwin: Sydney. 1989. In the 1910s, responding to the suggestion that Frankston was named after Frank Liardet, Wilbraham's grandson stated that the family believed it had been named after the early white settler Charles Franks. The original homestead \\"Ballam Park\\" still stands in Karingal today, and is now heritage-listed. It is also home to the Frankston Historical Society, which conducts regular guided tours of the homestead. Schools Primary *Ballam Park Primary School *Karingal Heights Primary School *Karingal Primary School Secondary * McClelland College * Naranga school for special education Shopping Karingal's original shopping centre, now known as Karingal Village Shops, is still located on Ashleigh Avenue, near Karingal Drive. A large section of the earlier shopping centre was redeveloped at the turn of the century, replacing the old supermarket with a larger one, and the local service station with a bottle shop. Karingal Post Office continues to operate, but in a part of the new complex. Karingal is also home to Frankston's second largest shopping complex, Centro Karingal, or locally known as the 'Karingal Hub' or 'The Hub' (the largest being the Bayside Shopping Centre in the Frankston CBD). It features two Woolworths supermarkets, a Big W department store and 120 speciality stores. The centre boasts an entertainment precinct, called 'StarZone Karingal', with restaurants, a pub and a 12 screen Village Cinema complex. StarZone Karingal is also home to one of the three V max \\"super screens\\" in Australia. Infrastructure =Transport= Karingal's arterial road is Karingal Drive, which runs through the heart of the suburb, from Skye Road to Cranbourne Road. Ashleigh Avenue is another key road, which runs from Karingal Drive into Frankston East. On Karingal's northern border, Skye Road is the connection with Frankston North, Seaford and Langwarrin. Cranbourne Road touches Karingal's southernmost edge, and connects it to the Frankston CBD, to the neighbouring suburb of Langwarrin and terminates in the City of Casey suburb of Cranbourne. Metropolitan bus services run along all of these roads, connecting Karingal with the Frankston CBD and its neighbouring suburbs. Another major transport route, Peninsula Link (also known as the Frankston By-Pass) opened in January 2013. This divides Karingal and Langwarrin, and provides access to the rest of Greater Melbourne, and to the Mornington Peninsula. =Health= Two hospitals are located in Karingal, Peninsula Private Hospital and the St. John of God Rehabilitation Hospital. Sport Karingal Football Club, known as the \\"Karingal Bulls\\" is an Australian Football team competing in the 2nd division of the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League. Their home ground is located in Ballam Park alongside the Karingal Cricket Club.

The loss of farms in the area led to serious decline in the numbers of these dogs until 1985 when some breeders found a few dogs and used the original breed standard as their guide in re-introducing the dog. History In the past, all the dogs that worked with cattle were called Bouvier (bovine herder). Each region throughout the area had its own type. From ancient rough-coated stock, these dogs were prized guardians and drovers. As the motorized age arrived, the need for driving cattle to the market was gone and so was the call that helped with the drives. The Bouviers were almost eliminated after the bloody fighting of World War I. Many of the rarer types were lost altogether. The breeds that are a memory include: Bouvier de Roulers, Bouvier de Moerman, and Bouvier de Paret. Still remaining are the Bouvier de Ardennes and Bouvier des Flandres.

The population was 2,309 at the 2010 census. Located up the Weber River from Ogden, Mountain Green is the world headquarters of the Browning Arms Company. Geography Mountain Green lies in Morgan Valley at the east end of lower Weber Canyon, just north of I-84 at the interchange with Utah State Route 167 (Trappers Loop). The community is located in the northwest corner of Morgan County, and includes the lowest point in the county. History =Deserters Point= The present-day site of Mountain Green was the location of a historic meeting of three groups of mountain men in May 1825. Peter Skene Ogden, leading 58 trappers from the British Hudson's Bay Company, camped here on May 22, 1825. The next day, 25 American Rocky Mountain Fur Company trappers belonging to John Henry Weber's brigade arrived under the command of Johnson Gardner. √âtienne Provost was also encamped in the area, with his own company of 15. On May 24, 1825 John Gray, a half-Iroquois leader of the freemen trappers who were dissatisfied with the conditions and pay under the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, declared their intention to leave Ogden‚Äôs brigade. The HBC freemen had spent the previous several days with Johnson Gardner‚Äôs group, and had brought the Americans back with them to support the freemen‚Äôs plan to desert, seeking higher payments for their furs and lower prices for supplies.Holloway, Thomas H., ‚Äú‚ÄòNow We Go‚Äô: Snake Country Freemen and the Desertions of May 1825,‚Äù The Rocky Mountain Fur Trade Journal, Vol. 12 (2018), pp. 37‚Äì73. Several men who had previously deserted HBC encouraged others to come along. In the end 23 Hudson's Bay Company trappers deserted, taking some 700 pelts with them. Ogden and his remaining men left the area the next day. This encounter led to a territorial dispute. Gardner and his men claimed the Hudson's Bay Company trappers were violating United States soil, while Ogden insisted the area was jointly controlled by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Provost, who remained neutral in the argument, was in fact the only one with a valid claim. The Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819 had recognized Spain's rights to the territory south of the 42nd parallel. Control had then passed in 1822 to newly independent Mexico, whose government had granted Provost a license for his activities in the region. The deserting HBC freemen joined the American trappers on their way to Henrys Fork (Green River) about 120 miles to the east for the first of what was to be sixteen Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, organized by fur trade entrepreneur William H. Ashley, which took place on July 1, 1825. For some years prior, American trappers and mountain men had traveled as much as 2,000 miles to transport their furs to markets in St. Louis. For the Spanish, Taos was a common destination. The site became known as Deserters Point. Today there is a rest stop there, with a historical marker. The highway which connects Mountain Green with the Ogden Valley over the ridge to the north is named Trappers Loop. =Settlement= When Mormon pioneers began to arrive in Morgan County in the 1850s, they found a man named Ben Simon already in possession of the land in the Mountain Green area. The Mexican government had granted Simon the use of this land for grazing cattle, sometime before the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He and his brother James had apparently been trading with the Shoshone in the vicinity for some 20 years. Such early settlers as George W. Higley and Gordon Beckstead moved to Mountain Green in the 1850s with permission from the Simons and the Native Americans. The settlement was named Mountain Green due to its abundant green grass. In 1877 the population was about 150, but a number of families left in fear of conflict with the Indians, and the 1880 census showed only 75 residents. =Modern era= Around 1960 the Ogden-based Browning Arms Company found the need for a rural test-firing facility. They purchased a Mountain Green farm in 1961, and by 1968 Browning had relocated its executive offices, research and development, sales and data processing to the Morgan County location. Mountain Green Fire District A volunteer fire department called the Mountain Green Fire District was established here in July 1971. It was started due to a perceived need for faster response times than the county fire station some away in Morgan could provide. A separate fire station was built in 1973. In 1997, the Insurance Services Office evaluated the Mountain Green Fire District and gave it a Fire Suppression Rating Schedule rating of class 6, equal to the grade of the Morgan Fire Department. Mountain Green has remained unincorporated and largely undeveloped, but it is growing quickly. In 2007 the northern Utah section of the American Institute of Architects offered a design assistance team to develop guidelines for a new Mountain Green town center. Demographics As an unincorporated community, Mountain Green lacks official boundaries, so population estimates vary. An informal estimate in 2003 gave the population as 4,000, approximately half the total Morgan County population. As of the census of 2010, there were 2,309 people living in the CDP. There were 688 housing units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.8% White, 0.1% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.9% Asian, 0.5% from some other race, and 0.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.1% of the population. Education Mountain Green has its own elementary school and middle school, Mountain Green Elementary School and Mountain Green Middle School . Older students attend Morgan High School in Morgan.

Distal expansion of the long bones as well as painful, swollen joints and synovial villous proliferation are often seen. The condition may occur alone (primary), or it may be secondary to diseases like lung cancer. Among patients with lung cancer, it is most associated with adenocarcinoma and least associated with small cell lung cancer. These patients often get clubbing and increased bone deposition on long bones. Their presenting symptoms are sometimes only clubbing and painful ankles. Cause Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is one of many distant effect disorders due to cancer, with lung cancer being the most common cause but also occurring with ovarian or adrenal malignancies. A distant effect disorder, or a paraneoplastic syndrome, affects distant areas and thus is not related to local compression or obstruction effects from the tumor. Other paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, SIADH, Cushing's syndrome and a variety of neurological disorders. Diagnosis People with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may have bone scans showing parallel lines of activity along the cortex of the shafts and ends of tibiae, femurs and radii; especially around the knees, ankles and wrists. This activity may decrease after treatment of the underlying cause.Essentials of Nuclear Medicine Imaging (Sixth Edition), 2012 Treatment Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can give significant relief of the symptoms. Treatment of lung cancer or other causes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy results in regression of symptoms for some patients.

The Orchestra is the Professional Orchestra in Residence at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. The CUSO is led by Music Director and Conductor Stephen Alltop.  Founding of the Orchestra  In 1959, two school music teachers, Martha Wendt and Gilbert Papp, along with well-known local television weatherman Wyndham Roberts, started the process that eventually led to the formation of (as it was initially called) the Champaign-Urbana Civic Symphony Orchestra. On the academic side of his meteorology career, Roberts was a scientist at the Illinois State Water Survey, and both Wendt, a violinist, and Papp, a clarinetist, were teachers in the Unit 4 (Champaign) school district. These two teachers were American Federation of Musicians members and they, together with Roberts and Dr. Bernard Goodman, on the music faculty at the University of Illinois, were convinced that the orchestra would best succeed if the musicians were paid for both concerts and rehearsals, so fundraising from individuals as well as corporations was made a high priority. During the spring of 1960, more people were brought into the process, the organization was incorporated with nonprofit status, and it was announced that the board of directors consisted of John Dimond, president; Stanley W. Rahn, secretary; Verrollton C. Shaul, publicity; Donald D. Richmond, attorney; and H. I. Gelvin, Ruth Youngerman, Martha Wendt, Doris Dodds, and Audrey Stewart, members. Also, Wyndham J. Roberts and Gilbert Papp served as vice president and treasurer, respectively. Dates for the first two concerts were announced and the organization applied for membership in the American Symphony Orchestra League. Meanwhile, Goodman, who joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in 1947 and who was a longtime member of the Walden String Quartet and had conducted the highly respected University of Illinois Symphony Orchestra since 1950, was starting to choose the musicians. By midsummer, Bernard Goodman had accepted the post of conductor; a plan for subscription levels was adopted; a good portion of the first-year $8,500 budget was received or pledged, mostly as relatively large donations; and the beginnings of a Symphony Orchestra Guild had been undertaken, led by Ruth Youngerman. Later in July, a widespread publicity and fundraising effort was launched. In the early fall, the makeup of the orchestra was settled and the orchestra's first season consisted of two concerts: one on October 20, 1960, with pianist Theodore Lettvin as guest artist, playing Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" Piano Concerto; and an all-Tchaikovsky concert on April 20, 1961, featuring violinist Mischa Mischakoff as soloist in the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. The nearly sixty-year run (to date) of the orchestra had begun, a success that was enhanced in a May 14, 1969, concert at the end of CUSO's ninth season, when the orchestra moved from Smith Music Hall to the Great Hall of the newly built Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.  Music Directors  Bernard Goodman was music director of the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra for its first fourteen seasons. In November 1973, he announced his retirement from both the CUSO and the University of Illinois, and continued to direct the orchestra through the 1973‚Äì1974 season. In May 1974, it was announced that Paul Vermel, music director of the Portland Symphony Orchestra, would succeed Goodman at the CUSO, and Vermel directed the symphony for the next twenty seasons. In early 1994, Paul Vermel announced his retirement both as music director of the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra and as professor at the University of Illinois. He went on to direct the Northwest Symphony Orchestra in suburban Chicago until 2013. He continues as Director Emeritus there, and the Northwest Symphony Orchestra is continuing both the Paul Vermel Young Artist Award program and the Paul Vermel Conductor Apprenticeship Program. In June 1994, the CUSO announced that two concerts during the 1994‚Äì1995 season would be conducted by Vermel, with the other four concerts conducted by outside guest conductors, each with specific strengths: * a September concert conducted by Kenneth Kiesler, director of the Illinois Symphony Orchestra, which performs in Springfield and Bloomington, Illinois * an October concert conducted by Catherine Comet, director of the Grand Rapids Symphony * a January 1995 pops concert conducted by John Covelli, director of the Binghamton, New York Symphony and the Greater Palm Beach Symphony * an April concert conducted by Michael Charry, which included an avant-garde work by Donald Erb. At the end of that season, the CUSO Board had reached no decision about a new director and only three subscription concerts were scheduled for the 1995‚Äì1996 season, conducted by two University of Illinois professors, Ian Hobson and Chester Alwes. Paul Vermel conducted a scheduled benefit concert, and a systematic strategy of cost cutting and fundraising was undertaken. The director search was reopened and in April 1996, Steven Larsen was named as the new director. From 1996 to 2012, Steven Larsen was music director of both the Rockford Symphony Orchestra and the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra. In 2011, he indicated that he wanted to reduce his workload, and intended to direct just the Rockford Symphony Orchestra after the 2011‚Äì2012 season. Therefore, during 2011, a music director/conductor search committee was formed, comprising both CUSO Board members and CUSO musicians. From 17 applications received, the committee selected four finalists, and in the spring of 2012, the CUSO Board announced that the 2012‚Äì2013 season would serve as a search year, with five guest conductors, four of whom would be candidates for the director's post: * Farkhad Khudyev of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, artistic director and conductor of the New Jersey Intergenerational Orchestra (October 13, 2012) * David Commanday of Peoria, Illinois, artistic director and conductor of the Heartland Festival Orchestra (January 18, 2013) * Alexander Platt of Chicago, Illinois, music director of the Marion Philharmonic Orchestra and the Wisconsin Philharmonic (Waukesha), and principal conductor of the Chicago Opera Theater (February 10, 2013) * Stephen Alltop of Evanston, Illinois, music director and conductor of the Elmhurst Symphony Orchestra and the Apollo Chorus of Chicago (March 9, 2013). In late March 2013, the Board announced that Stephen Alltop would become the fourth director of the orchestra.  About the Orchestra  The CUSO is an orchestra that performs five to six subscription concerts and three to four Youth Concerts each season. The CUSO reaches more than 45,000 people each year through live performance and concert broadcasts. Throughout its history, the CUSO has established a number of musical landmarks, including the performances of commissioned works and the showcasing of internationally acclaimed guest artists. The opening concert of the 1991‚Äì1992 concert season, \\"Celebration!\\" featured only music that was composed and performed by African-Americans. A historic event, this performance was heard nationally over American Public Radio's \\"Performance Today\\" and was honored with an American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Award for Adventurous Programming. The CUSO continues its long-standing tradition of collaboration with the University of Illinois Oratorio Society in the presentation of major choral works.  Community Outreach  One of the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra's main goals is to provide high-quality music education for the youth of the Champaign-Urbana metropolitan area. Each year, the CUSO reaches approximately 15,000 youths through its Youth Concerts, In-School Concerts, and events such as the Instrument Petting Zoo.  Personnel  In addition to the approximately sixty-five contracted players and the Music Director, the CUSO employs three administrative staff members: an Executive Director, Operations Manager, and Music Librarian. The orchestra also employs many area musicians as substitute or extra musicians on an as-needed basis.  Symphony Guild  Formed in 1962, the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra Guild serves in a fundraising and support capacity to the CUSO. The Guild is the primary source of funding for the CUSO's educational programs.  2020‚Äì2021 Season  The 2020‚Äì2021 season will consist of a number of online video events: * October 23, 2020: Welcome Back Pops!

He was bishop of Calcutta from 1827 to 1828. He also wrote travel and art books. Life Born 23 January 1786 at Rugby, he was the eldest son of Thomas James, head-master of Rugby School, by his second wife. He was educated at Rugby until he was twelve years old, when, through the influence of the Earl of Dartmouth, he was placed on the foundation of Charterhouse School. In 1803 he gained the first prize medal given by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Sciences. He left Charterhouse in May 1804, and entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner. After the death of his father, 23 September 1804, he was nominated dean's student by Cyril Jackson. He graduated B.A. 9 March 1808, and M.A. 24 October 1810, and continued to reside at Oxford, first as a private tutor and afterwards as student and tutor of Christ Church, till 1813, when he went abroad. During this time James visited the courts of Berlin, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg. He visited Moscow, which had just then been burned, and went through Poland to Vienna. In 1816 James visited Italy, and studied painting at Rome and Naples. On his return to England he took holy orders, and resigned his studentship on being presented by the dean and chapter of Christ Church to the vicarage of Flitton-cum-Silsoe in Bedfordshire. James's appointment to the bishopric of Calcutta, in succession to Reginald Heber, came at the end of 1826, and he resigned his vicarage in April 1827. The University of Oxford gave him the degree of D.D. by diploma on 10 May, and on Whitsunday, 3 June, he was consecrated at Lambeth. He landed at Calcutta 18 January 1828, and was installed in Calcutta Cathedral on the following Sunday, the 20th. For purposes of organisation James divided the city of Calcutta into three parochial districts, the fort itself constituting a fourth. On 20 June 1828 he set out on a visitation to the western provinces of his diocese, but, taken ill, he returned to Calcutta and was advised to take a sea voyage. He sailed for China on 9 August, but died during the voyage on 22 August. Works James published, in 1816, a Journal of a Tour in Germany, Sweden, Russia, and Poland, during 1813 and 1814, Subsequent editions appeared in 1817 and 1819. He published two works on art‚ÄîThe Italian Schools of Painting, in 1820, and The Flemish, Dutch, and German Schools of Painting, in 1822‚Äîand a theological work entitled The Semi-Sceptic, or the Common Sense of Religion considered, in 1825. His intention was to add treatises on the English, French, and Spanish schools. In 1826 he began the publication of a series of Views in Russia, Sweden, Poland, and Germany. These were engraved on stone by himself, and coloured so as to represent originals. Five numbers appeared during 1826 and 1827, when the publication was interrupted. A Charge by him was published in 1829. Family In 1823 James married Marianne Jane, fourth daughter of Frederick Reeves, of East Sheen, Surrey, and formerly of Mangalore, in the Bombay presidency.

This broadcast featured the voices of Enrico Caruso and other Metropolitan Opera stars. Members of the public and the press used earphones to listen to the broadcast in several locations throughout the city. This marked the beginning of what would become nearly universal wireless radio communication. First public broadcast =Date= A 1907 advertisement placed by Lee de Forest's Radio Telephone Company stated: Several years later, on January 13, 1910, the first public radio broadcast was an experimental transmission of a live Metropolitan Opera House performance by several famous opera singers. This transmission was arranged by de Forest. This event is regarded as the birth of public radio broadcasting. =Performers= The wireless radio broadcast consisted of performances of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. Riccardo Martin performed as Turridu, Emmy Destinn as Santuzza, and Enrico Caruso as Canio. The conductor was Egisto Tango. The New York Times reported on January 14, 1910: Equipment Early military receiver The few radio receivers able to pick up this first-ever \\"outside broadcast\\" were those at the De Forest Radio Laboratory, on board ships in New York Harbor, in large hotels on Times Square and at New York City locations where members of the press were stationed at receiving sets. Public receivers with earphones had been set up in several well-advertised locations throughout New York City. There were members of the press stationed at various receiving sets throughout the city and the public was invited to listen to the broadcast. The experiment was considered mostly unsuccessful. The microphones of the day were of poor quality and could not pick up most of the singing on stage. Only off-stage singers singing directly into a microphone could be heard clearly. The New York Times reported the next day that static and interference \\"kept the homeless song waves from finding themselves\\".\\"Wireless Melody Jarred,\\" The New York Times, Friday, January 14, 1910, page 2 De Forest's Radio Telephone Company manufactured and sold the first commercial radios in the demonstration room at the Metropolitan Life Tower in New York City for this public event. The wireless transmitter had 500 watts of power. It is reported that this broadcast was heard away on a ship at sea. The broadcast was also heard away in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  Significance  New Jersey Telephone Herald entertainers The birth of public radio broadcasting had an immediate impact on radio broadcasting as it stimulated the idea of having additional musical programs. The next month on February 24th the Manhattan Opera Company's new opera singer Mariette Mazarin sang \\"Love is a rebellious bird\\" from Carmen over a transmitter located in DeForest's laboratory.\\"Radio Telephone Experiments\\", Modern Electrics, May 1910, page 63. (earlyradiohistory.us) This radio concert was heard by a group of scientists, diplomats, newspaper reporters and the public within . The New Jersey Telephone Herald did evening musical shows after their regular daily newscasts starting on March 15, 1911. The various musical programs consisted of instrumental music from a regular orchestra in attendance, individual recitals, and group singers. In addition they had theatrical performances, opera and organ playing at their new location on the second floor of the Essex Building in Newark, New Jersey. DeForest in 1912 put together an amplifying technology from his 1906 Audion vacuum tube invention. He figured out how to take a weak signal and increase it many times (amplification) through a feedback circuit. He had learned through experimentation that his Audion would increase the strength of a weak signal to some degree if a small wire mesh was placed inside the vacuum tube between the heated electron emitting element at the bottom of the tube and the pick up plate on top that had a high voltage opposite charge. He took this electronic idea one step further by taking part of that amplified electrical signal and sending it back through the Audion again. That increased the signal strength even further. That idea was further developed by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner and the technology of the vacuum tube feedback oscillator was perfected in 1912 by them.DeForest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., 283 U.S. 664 (May 25, 1931). This continuous feedback loop idea became a source of continuous waves through repeated feedback and amplification over and over again. The continuous waves of a particular frequency could be altered to a small degree by another signal introduced into it. This is called amplitude modulation. This was further advanced to the idea of having very high frequency continuous waves (tens-of-thousands of cycles-per-second (kHz) modulated (slightly altered) with another signal (e.g. voice, music) from a microphone. From that concept developed the amplitude modulated transmitter, which lead to AM radio broadcast entertainment.

Early life Willie McGee was born in Pachuta, Clarke County, Mississippi, around 1916 to Bessie and Jasper McGee Sr., who was a laborer at Eastman Gardiner Lumber Company. He had one brother, Jasper McGee, Jr. McGee lived with his parents and brother at 64 3d Red Line, an area of segregated colored company housing. McGee attended local, segregated schools for a short time before working. He married Eliza Jane Patton on April 15, 1935. McGee had four children with Patton: Willie Earl, Della, Gracie Lee and Mary. https://mcgeebook.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/rosalee-news/ Crime On November 3, 1945, McGee was arrested in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on a charge of grand larceny for stealing a truck owned by the Laurel Wholesale Grocery, where he was employed. Two of his friends placed him in the vicinity at the time of a criminal assault of a woman in her residence, leading to him being questioned about the assault. On November 9, 1945, McGee was charged with the assault. It was reported that he had made an oral confession shortly after his arrest. This confession was attested to by the county attorney and other members of the local political power structure. McGee and his supporters would later argue that any such confession was made under duress. Such forced confessions were a commonplace in the Jim Crow legal system of the time. Trials =First trial= On Monday, December 3, 1945, McGee was indicted by the grand jury on a charge of rape, was arraigned in the circuit court, and a plea of not guilty was entered for him by the district attorney. The prosecution charged that McGee kept the money from a Laurel Wholesale Grocery delivery he made, and used it to buy whiskey. The next morning, police claimed that employees of the grocery store found McGee asleep in the delivery truck. He was picked up in Hattiesburg by the police the next afternoon. The jury deliberated for only two and a half minutes to return the guilty verdict. On December 11, 1945, McGee was sentenced to death. The first trial initially attracted wide attention because National Guard troops were needed to escort the defendant from the Hinds County jail to Laurel, in Jones County. There were credible rumors of a white supremacist lynch mob that sought to break him out of the Laurel jail. At the time, lynch mobs and vigilante justice were common in the south, and even liberal southerners such as famed author William Faulkner tacitly supported mob justice. The trial was conducted under the protection of the troops and a military caravan returned McGee to Jackson by nightfall. Attorney Forrest B. Jackson stated that McGee's constitutional rights were violated during his trial and filed an appeal. Ultimately, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that the trial had violated McGee's rights because the trial court failed to consider McGee‚Äôs motion for a change of venue. A new trial was scheduled. =Second trial= The second trial was set for November 4, 1946, on the charge of rape which was a capital offense in Mississippi. No white men in Mississippi had ever been sentenced to death for rape, but black men were often executed when convicted for the rape of white women. McGee again applied for a change of venue. This time, Judge John C. Stennis (later a U.S. Senator from Mississippi for 42 years) granted the motion and the case was moved to Forrest County (Hattiesburg). At that trial, after 11 minutes of deliberation, the all-white jury again returned a guilty verdict. Judge Burkitt Collins again sentenced McGee to death by electric chair, to be carried out on December 20, 1946. On November 23, 1946, McGee's attorney filed an appeal. Again, the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned the verdict. This time it ruled that Jones County's practice of excluding African- American citizens from its grand juries violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. =Third trial= McGee's third trial began on February 16, 1948, and was granted by the State Supreme Court because African Americans were excluded from the juries which indicted and convicted him. For the first time in Jones County history, African Americans were registered as part of the 18-man grand jury. However, decades after the trial, one of the prosecutors allegedly boasted that they had changed the roll of grand jurors to falsely include two black doctors whom they knew would remain silent. Yet again, no blacks served on the actual jury. Testimony alleged that McGee entered the victim's home through an outside window. It was suggested that he then violently assaulted and strangled her. The prosecution suggested that he then raced away in the stolen truck that he had parked some distance from the home. The prosecution played on the racial fears of a southern white jury by appealing to the stereotype of a sexually deviant and rapacious black man. The testimony of the victim's husband was that their baby had been sick that night and that neither went to bed before 4 a.m., and then he occupied a back room 25 to 30 feet away from his wife's room. He had apparently heard nothing of this break in and violent assault until his wife came and woke him. Trial testimony of the alleged companion of McGee on the night of the assault stated he was on a wild joyride in the wholesale grocery truck McGee was driving. He testified that they drove around and returned to Laurel after consuming three half-pints of whiskey on the jaunt. They visited gambling houses in Laurel and left a house in \\"The Bottoms\\" about 4:00 am in the truck. He said that he left McGee and the truck at Masonite Drive and arrived at his own home half a block away at 4:15 am. Prosecutors played on the white jurors' racial stereotypes by suggesting that McGee had told another companion a few days before the rape, \\"I'm going to get me a white woman.\\" After deliberating within less than an hour, on March 6, 1948, the jury returned to the court room with a guilty verdict. When the judge asked if McGee had anything to say, he responded, \\"Thank you, Judge, I have no fear.\\" The execution was set by Judge F. Burkitt Collins for Friday, April 9, 1948. Stays of execution Justice Sidney Smith of the state's highest court stayed the execution for June 3, 1949. On June 3, 1949, McGee was granted another stay of execution five hours before he was scheduled to die. McGee was then scheduled for execution on July 27, 1950. After his conviction, McGee was defended by the Civil Rights Congress, which mounted a public campaign as well as filing legal appeals of his case. In the local black community, it was thought that McGee may have had a consensual relationship with the alleged victim, but these thoughts were too incendiary to be brought up at trial. The son of the prosecutor in the case has stated that McGee told his father that he was having a consensual affair with the alleged victim. July 24, 1950, Bella Abzug, then a young attorney for the Civil Rights Congress, represented McGee's appeals in Mississippi and before the US Supreme Court in one of the first civil rights cases of her legal career. Supreme Court Justice Harold Burton ordered the fourth stay on July 26, 1950, creating an international affair; however the full U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear McGee's final appeal. Mississippi newspapers alleged that the segregationist Governor, Fielding L. Wright, was threatened with death from the 'Northern Communists.' Wright was an ardent white supremacist and segregationist, and these claims of 'Communist Agitation' were commonly used in the Jim Crow South. Public figures Author William Faulkner wrote a letter insisting the case against McGee was unproven. His remarks were quoted by McGee's supporters for the purpose of gathering local backing for McGee. Other notable public figures that spoke out were the activist Jessica Mitford,Mitford, Jessica A Fine Old Conflict Civil Rights Congress activist Paul Robeson, and Civil Rights activist Josephine Baker. Execution The night before McGee was electrocuted on May 8, 1951, by the state of Mississippi, he wrote a farewell letter to Rosetta Saffold (alias Rosalee McGee): Among the 60 men watching him die were the husband of his alleged rape victim, her brother, and two of her brothers-in-law. The press was allowed to attend the execution. A crowd of more than 1500 were on the courthouse lawn, in a public execution reminiscent of the lynching that McGee had narrowly avoided. The execution was broadcast on radio.

Bologna ‚Äì 1831, Moscow) was an Italian architect, painter, engraver and educator who worked in Moscow in 1780s-1820s. Most of his architectural work perished in the Fire of 1812, was severely altered, demolished or otherwise lost.  Biography  Camporesi arrived in Russia in 1780s, probably as an assistant to Giacomo Quarenghi. Extent of his architectural work in 18th century remains disputed, and he is better known as a fine vedutist who documented Moscow prior to the devastating Fire of 1812. For a decade (1784-1796) Camporesi worked under Quarenghi and Karl Blank on the Catherine's Palace in Moscow, where he was employed both as an architect and a plasterer craftsman. Eventually, he developed into a generalist architect: capable of independently managing construction projects, Camporesi was regularly employed by private clients - for his design talents as well as business capabilities. His input to Nikolai Sheremetev's Ostankino Palace, for example, included interior design, architectural drafts of palace expansion, and also budget schedules and hiring craftsmen.A. –ü–æ—Ç—å–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞. –ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –§—Ä–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ –ö–∞–º–ø–æ—Ä–µ–∑–∏ (1747 ‚Äì 1831) –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ. 1999 Works by the architect are best preserved in the vicinity of Yakhroma, in former estates of Apraksin and Sheremetev families. Camporesi also left a significant legacy of unbuilt architectural drafts (preserved at the Moscow Museum of Architecture), including an unusual large octagonal structure codenamed Moscow House. Contemporary studies fail to explain the purpose of this elaborate project; probably, it's octagonal plan was a homage to Saint Michael's Castle, commissioned by one of emperor Paul's statesmen and discarded after Paul's death. In 1810s-1820s Camporesi was employed by the Commission of Moscow Kremlin; in addition to restoration of Kremlin buildings he coached students of the Kremlin school of architecture, most notably Domenico Giliardi and Afanasy Grigoriev.

He played hurling with his local club James Stephens and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1935 until 1945. Playing career =Club= Blanchfield played his club hurling with the famous James Stephens club in Kilkenny and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1935. It was the club's first ever victory in a county final. Blanchfield added a second county medal to his collection in 1937. =Inter-county= Blanchfield first came to prominence on the inter- county scene with Kilkenny in 1935. That year he collected his first Leinster title following a victory over Laois. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Blanchfield's take on Limerick for the second time in three years. Once again the match was a close one, however, Kilkenny clung on and won by a single point ‚Äì 2-5 to 2-4. It was Blanchfield's first All-Ireland medal. In 1936 Blanchfield added a second Leinster medal to his collection before lining out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again, the two outstanding teams of the decade, Kilkenny and Limerick, were paired together in the championship decider. Limerick were coming into their prime at this stage and gained revenge for the defeats of 1933 and 1935 by trouncing ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô on a score line of 5-6 to 1-5. Kilkenny bounced back in 1937 with Blanchfield collecting a third Leinster winners' title. The All-Ireland final pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary in the unusual venue of FitzGerald Stadium in Killarney. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô were definitely on a downward spiral by this stage as they were walloped by 3-11 to 0-3. In 1939 ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô reclaimed their provincial crown with a victory over reigning All-Ireland champions Dublin. It was Blanchfield's fourth provincial medal of the decade. The subsequent All- Ireland final against Cork has gone down in history as the famous ‚Äòthunder and lightning‚Äô final when a huge downpour interrupted play. In the end victory went to Kilkenny by a single point. It was not the last time that ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô would defeat ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô by a single point in a final. It was Blanchfield's second All-Ireland medal. In 1940 Blanchfield added a fifth Leinster medal to his collection after another defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny and Limerick, the two dominant team of the last decade, take to the field for one final game. Kilkenny had peaked in the final the year before while Limerick were now reaching their prime. A 3-7 to 1-7 defeat for Kilkenny resulted in Blanchfield ending up on the losing side for the third time. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the county hampered Kilkenny‚Äôs championship hopes for the next few seasons. In spite of this the team bounced back in 1943 with Blanchfield adding a sixth Leinster medal to his already impressive collection. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final provided what was regarded as the time as the biggest shock in the history of the championship. Antrim had defeated Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final in, what was described as, a fluke. Antrim proved that their victory was far from lucky as they defeated Blanchfield's side in the subsequent semi-final. Two years later in 1945 Blanchfield won his seventh and final Leinster medal before lining out in his final All-Ireland final. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion. Almost 70,000 people packed into Croke Park to witness a classic encounter, with 5,000 more fans being locked out of the stadium. Tipp took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back with three second-half goals. In spite of this Tipp held on to win the game by 5-6 to 3-6. Blanchfield retired from inter-county hurling after this defeat.

It stars Andreas Schnaas, Marc Trinkhaus, Uwe Gr√ºntjes, and Winni Holl. Plot A group of friends become lost on the open ocean and somehow end up on an island, lorded over by Karl (Andreas Schnaas) and Karl Sr. (Marc Trinkhaus). The group are hunted down by Karl's metal-masked mercenaries, but two vengeful ninja brothers step in to help. The groups gather what weapons they can find and face off against the tyrant, his father, and their infantry of doom. The film opens with three men, Ron, Mark, and Peter abandoning their boat in the middle of the ocean and happening upon an uncharted island. After being captured by a gang of masked men, the three awaken to find themselves tied to crucifixes in the middle of a large militia camp. The trio are then introduced to the leader of the militia, Karl Berger, Jr. (better known to his men as The Meister). Karl and his aging father Karl Sr. oversee a series of gruesome executions before threatening the three trespassers' lives. After spitting in Karl's face, Peter is stripped of his shirt and stakes are driven through his ribcage. The two remaining friends as well as a traitor named Leon are turned loose in the forest to be hunted down by Karl's army of trained killers. After Ron and Mark learn of the Meister's horrific experiments, the three begin the search for weapons. Meanwhile, Karl's hired surgeon Dr. Senius is working on a breed of hideously deformed super soldiers that are going to replace the fallen ones in battle. After being disgusted with Senius's overall progress, Karl threatens Senius with death if he doesn't have the first batch ready within 24 hours. The next day, Leon tells the men of an armory located nearby. Using handmade spears, the three kill two guards and severely injure one before taking off with their weapons. The surviving guard is punished for his disobedience by Karl when his spinal cord is torn from his anus with a large meat hook. Senius's first batch of super soldiers are turned loose in the woods. After a run-in with the super soldiers. Ron and Mark part with Leon who acquires the help of two comrades named Son and Giang. After quickly dispatching the soldiers, the three look for Ron and Mark. Ron and Mark meet their ends at a small pond when they are ambushed by a group of infantrymen. After their corpses arrive back at the base in poor condition (Ron's body split in half at the waist and the upper left corner of his head missing and Mark's head split in two down the middle) Senius orders that the soldiers responsible be punished right away. Karl lines them up and shoots them in the head one by one with a sawed-off double barrel shotgun. When the third soldier runs from his execution, Karl to shoots him in the kneecap. Karl then drowns him in a nearby puddle while Senius listens and licks his lips. Then Karl deploys a heavily trained gang of assassins called the Black Demons to hunt down the remaining traitors and kill them. After briefly confronting the ninjas and killing them, Son, Giang and Leon plan a full-scale attack on the camp at sundown. After reaching the main gates disguised as Black Demons with a prisoner, the two guards on patrol demand to know why Leon's still alive. Son and Giang then kill them both and advance on the camp. After slitting a soldier's throat, Leon steals his RPG and oversees the fight from on top of a hill and assists the two others in killing off the soldiers. After running low on ammo, Leon joins Son and Giang on the ground below. Leon confronts a soldier wielding a machete and is impaled. With what energy he has left, Leon takes his killer's revolver and shoots him. Leon drops dead. Son hides outside of Senius's tent and slices off his nose with a sword. Senius stumbles back into his tent where an unfinished super soldier asphyxiates him in his open torso and subsequently tears off his head. Senius is finished when his headless body runs outside headless and Giang performs a coup de gr√¢ce with an Uzi. Both Son and Giang find Leon's body and, in an act of vengeance, hunt down Karl Sr. and Karl. When they are found trying to escape the disaster, the two Karls are confronted by Son and Giang, who kill their remaining troops. Son and Giang then engage in hand-to-hand combat with Karl Sr. and his son. After Son gets the best of him, Karl Sr. calls upon his bodyguard, a hockey- masked commando with a mechanical arm. After a short scuffle, Son detaches the bodyguard's artificial arm and impales him with it. Giang and Karl continue to fight until Giang back flips over him, rams his fist through Karl's body from behind and places a hand grenade in his mouth. Karl's head explodes and he drops a rocket launcher. With the rocket launcher, Giang tells Son to get out of the way. After Son dives for cover, Giang proceeds to shoot Karl Sr. with the rocket launcher, immolating him. The two exchange a high five before the credits roll. Production Violent Shit III was filmed outside of Hamburg, Germany in 1993, but due to financial concerns, it was not officially released until six years later. Soundtrack The teaser trailer for the film features the songs You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones and Surprise! You're Dead! by Faith No More. Additionally, a techno instrumental called Blasphemic Beats plays over the closing credits accompanied by scenes from previous Violent Shit films. The film's soundtrack was composed by Gregor Adolph Hartz: # Prologue - Landing # Main Title # Senius At Work # The Meister # Guillotine Enforcement # Hook Guards - Face Off # End of Peter # Enter Leon - Runaway # Cave Carnage # Spear Attack # Ass Off # Dawn of the Zombies # Continuity Jackets # Marc and Ron Die # Ninja Action # Battle Action # Leon's Theme # E.R.

Karl Jr. again wears his trademark metal mask, while Karl Sr. appears to have become a cyborg zombie. Release It was released in the United States by Shock-O-Rama under the title Zombie Doom. It was later released on DVD in 2002 along with another Andreas Schnaas film; Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence.

First established in the United States after World War II, this type of racing was early-on characterized by its participants' modification of passenger cars in pursuit of higher speeds, hence the name. There are many sanctioning bodies for modifieds, each specifying different body styles and engine sizes. History Vintage racers from Wisconsin. The original NASCAR modifieds looked quite a bit like these cars. Modified racing began as race drivers modified their cars to gain a competitive advantage over their fellow competitors. What started out as minor modifications to the cars has now grown to the point that some modified classes are no longer based on any current production vehicles. NASCAR was instrumental in modified racing's beginnings. Some of NASCAR's pioneers were veteran modified racers long before NASCAR's inception in 1949. As time progressed, modifieds grew away from \\"strictly stock\\" or \\"stock cars\\", and became akin to both stock cars, and open-wheel cars. Today's supermodifieds have more in common with Indy cars than they do stock cars. Asphalt modified NASCAR modifieds getting ready for a race at Stafford Springs, CT. These modifieds are found mostly in the eastern half of the US. Both of the sanctioning bodies (NASCAR and ASA) listed here use the same rules, but do not race on the same tracks. The cars are easy to identify. These modifieds sit on large slick tires that are exposed on all four corners of the car. The roofs of these cars are more rounded than the other types of modifieds, their bodies look somewhat squashed, and have large, , Lexan spoilers on the rear of the cars. The driver sits on the left side of the car, and most of the time will have some type of small plastic windshield in front of him or her. All of these cars sport small NASCAR or ASA stickers on the doors. The largest builder of modifieds in the US is former driver Maynard Troyer, who (after retiring in 1982) set up shop and in the 1980s was turning out 100 asphalt modifieds annually.Circle Track, 9/84, p.85. The NSTA Top Speed Modified Tour is located in Carmel, Indiana, and has been around for approximately 30 years (www.TopSpeedMods.com). These asphalt race cars got their start at Mount Lawn Speedway near Indianapolis. It was once called the USA Modified Series. This traveling series races at local short tracks in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. In 2013 they raced for the first time on a road course, near South Haven, Michigan, at Gingerman Raceway. The series changed hands for 2017, from ICAR to NSTA, after being purchased by John Robbins (nephew of the former ASA pioneers) from Dave Muzillo. =NASCAR Whelen Modified tours= Northern Tour The NASCAR Whelen Modified series is the only remaining NASCAR series from the sanctioning body's original season in 1948. The original style of NASCAR modifieds actually pre-dates NASCAR's existence by many years.2006 NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour Media Guide. NASCAR, Daytona Beach, Florida, USA. Though it is now known as an asphalt-oval-only series, this was not always the case. The series originally started on dirt, and as more and more asphalt tracks opened, the series migrated to racing on the newer tracks. The series also had previously made forays into road racing with stops at Watkins Glen International in New York.http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=4737&FS;=NASCAR-TRUCK Kevin Schwartz to race at Watkins Glen at Motorsport.com Drivers like Bobby Allison and Red Farmer got their start in the NASCAR Modified series, which was popular both in the south and the Northeast. Many NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers have come from this series, including Ryan Preece, Jimmy Spencer, Geoff Bodine and Steve Park. Southern tour In late 2004, NASCAR bought out the Southern Modified Auto Racing Teams (SMART), and promptly renamed it the NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour. The southern tour uses exactly the same set of rules as the northern tour, but races primarily in the southeastern section of the US. The majority of races on the southern tour schedule occur before late April and after August as not to interfere with weekly racing at Bowman Gray Stadium. Once per year, the northern tour and the southern tour race at Bristol Motor Speedway, in Bristol, Tennessee. The two tours were permanently merged for the 2016 season. =American Speed Association= ASA Southern Modified Tour NASCAR's Whelen Southern Modified Tour has a direct competitor in the American Speed Association Southern Modified Tour. The ASA Southern Modified Tour came about as some tracks that were part of the NASCAR buyout of SMART were unable, or unwilling to join NASCAR. The ASA was contacted, and the new series was formed. Although both sanctioning bodies use the same rules (much as NASCAR and ARCA did with the Sprint Cup Series and the ARCA Re/Max Series), they do not share a single race date, nor do they race at any of the same tracks.Hamilton, Don: \\"The Mod Squad\\" Circle Track & Racing Technology Magazine (). Vol 5, Number 11 (November 2007), pp 46‚Äì52 Dirt modified Dirt modified is probably the most popular type of racing in the US. Almost every dirt sanctioning body has a class of modifieds. The Super DIRTcar Series modifieds are the easiest to identify. The driver sits in the middle of the car, with high-downforce, wind-channeling tunnels on either side of him. The roofs are very flat, and tilted to catch additional air. The front suspension is usually a coil-over setup, with a torsion-bar set-up for the rear suspension. They utilize full tube chassis, which to the untrained eye, looks to be a sprint car chassis, but is much different in reality. The IMCA- style modifieds are easy to identify as a whole, but distinguishing between the sanctioning bodies is all but impossible. The bodies are very flat on the sides, and lack the downforce generating tunnels the DIRTcar modifieds sport. The driver sits on the left side. One of the most notable differences between the IMCA-style modifieds and other modified series cars, is the use of stock production car frame sections as part of the racing chassis. These cars also race on smaller tires than the other types of modifieds, with most sanctioning bodies specifying the same tire. The IMCA Sportmods appear very similar to their brethren, but have distinctly different engines. The Afco KidModz appear the same as the others, but sport full tube chassis, and by rules, have to have Ford 2300 cc inline 4-cylinder engines.

In November 2004, Boundless Racing changed its name to DIRT Motorsports. In December of the same year, DIRT Motorsports bought Midwestern sanctioning body UMP.DIRT (DIRT Motorsports) The former DIRT big-block (and small block) modified series has seen many changes in their car designs since the 1970s, but the competition and will to win has remained the same. The ultra-fast, super nimble cars race primarily in the Northeastern US and in Canada, but have had a race added in the Midwest on the 2007 and the 2008 schedules. NASCAR and World of Outlaws Late Model driver Tim McCreadie came from this series, as did World of Outlaws Late Model drivers Tim Fuller and Vic Coffey. All of those drivers still race in the series on a part-time basis, between 10‚Äì30 times a year. Notable drivers having competed in DIRT modifieds include Bobby Allison, Tony Stewart, Andrew Ranger, Dave Blaney, Carl Edwards, JJ Yeley and David Reutimann. =IMCA/WISSOTA/UMP Modifieds= Organized in 1915, the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) is the oldest racing sanctioning body in the US. IMCA introduced the \\"E-Mod\\" (or Economy Modified) in 1979.International Motor Contest Association :: Welcome to IMCA.com! It has become one of the most popular dirt racing classes due to its simple design, light-weight, high power, and ability to adapt to varying track conditions easily. Most IMCA-style classes also boast a \\"claim rule,\\" wherein a racer may buy a competitors engine for a small amount of money (usually around $500). This rule was intended to keep engine prices from skyrocketing.http://www.imca.com/rules.php?divisionid=1 IMCA Modified Rules Sanctioning bodies WISSOTA and United Midwestern Promoters (UMP) also have classes that are almost identical to IMCA's modifieds, with a few small exceptions. The AMRA, or American Motor Racing Association also follows this popular formula for modifieds. NASCAR drivers Ken Schrader and Kenny Wallace own and race UMP Modifieds on off weekends from NASCAR. Some tracks sanction modifieds with IMCA-like specifications, such as Slinger Super Speedway. =IMCA SportMods= IMCA designed a new lower cost class of SportMod cars in 2004 to complement their Modified division. The division is divided into Northern SportMods and Southern SportMods divisions. The Northern SportMods have a few small differences from the Southern SportMods in the body of the car. These cars are a somewhat smaller and have less powerful engines.International Motor Contest Association :: Welcome to IMCA.com! They can be differentiated from IMCA Modifieds because the car has a break in the body that extends from the rear roof to the spoiler at the rear. =Afco KidModz= This relatively inexpensive (when compared to their \\"adult\\" counterparts) racing series is aimed at getting children into racing. It closely follows UMP's Modified rules, with the exception of a few areas. The engine must be a 2300 cc Ford inline 4-cylinder, and the drivers can be no younger than 12, nor older than 18. Some tracks will allow kids 10 or 11 to race, if the track's insurance will allow. The KidModz are also allowed to run tubular chassis, whereas the IMCA/WISSOTA/UMP Modifieds have to have sections of frames from stock production automobiles, with other sections being steel tubing. These cars are offered for sale completely assembled and ready-to-race for under $20,000. The unassembled price is lower. Outlaw Modifieds =GLOM= Found in the Midwestern United States, the Great Lakes Outlaw Modifieds (GLOM) are a cross between IMCA Modifieds, and UMP Late Models. These cars have nearly the same hand-made aluminum bodies as their UMP Late Model counterparts (without front fenders), feature tubular chassis, and sport unrestricted engines with aluminum engine blocks and heads. They also are allowed to utilize quick-change rear ends and aluminum wheels, whereas the IMCA modifieds are forced to race with heavier cast-iron engines, partial stock frames, steel wheels and Ford rear ends.http://www.imca.com/rules.php?divisionid=1 IMCA Modified rules =Ark-La- Tex= One type of Outlaw Modified can be found in the Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas area. Oddly enough, they are called Ark-La-Tex Winged Modifieds. These outlaw modifieds sport full tube chassis, and bodies that look like the Advanced Auto Parts Super DIRTcar racers, with the exception of the sprint car-like wing affixed to the roofs of the cars. These cars can also be found deeper into Texas such as Dallas and Waco. They are not always bodies that look like the Advance Auto Parts Super DIRTcar racer with a wing, some of the Winged Modifieds use bodies called skinny bodies that are not currently being made, but some drivers still have these. Winged Modified racing began at Boothill Speedway in Greenwood, LA and spread throughout the area, soon Heart O' Texas Speedway in Waco, TX was running them, so on Friday nights anybody from the Ark-La-Tex would go over to Waco and drive Winged Modifieds there, and on Saturday night they were at Boothill Speedway. Some of the nation biggest legends started out racing winged modifieds such as; Sprint Car Veteran Gary Wright of Hooks, TX, National Dirt Late Model Hall of Famer and Boothill Speedway Hall of Fame Inductee Doug Ingalls of Longview, TX, Boothill Speedway Hall of Fame inductee \\"Papa\\" Ray Ingalls of Longview, TX, Late Model Veteran and Boothill Speedway Hall of Fame inductee Ronny Adams of Greenwood, LA, Heart O' Texas Speedway Wall of Fame inductee Eldon Dotson of Allen, TX, Heart O' Texas Speedway Wall of Fame inductee Joe Sturdivant of Elgin, TX and 2010 Ark-La-Tex Wing Modified Champion, 2011 SMP Series Longhorn Champion and 38th Annual Louisiana State Dirt Track Championships winner at Boothill Speedway 19-year-old Tyler Townsend out of Longview, TX. =AOMRA= One type of outlaw modified in Alberta, Canada, races on both dirt and asphalt, with the same cars. Started in the mid-1980s, the Alberta Outlaw Modified Racing Association (AOMRA) races in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. They look like a cross between IMCA modifieds, and old NASCAR modifieds. =Outlaw Modified Racing Series= Organized in Florida in the 1970s, these Outlaw Modifieds are fairly unusual. They are built on tube chassis with coil over shocks. tires and a track make these cars are fast and nimble. 2300 cc, Four- cylinder power plants from Fords, Toyotas and even an odd Nissan are common, however the Ford 2300's are the favored motor. Motor rules have stayed very stable over the last 10 years with the only rule change coming in 2008 which allowed the Esslinger aluminum d-port head, due to the declining availability of the cast-iron cylinder heads. One thing that sets these cars apart from most modified racing series, is that these cars do not utilize roofs on the cars. SuperModifieds ISMA SuperModified. Note the extreme offset to the driver's side, and the engine mounted outside of the frame rails. Another type of modified popular in the Southwestern, and Northeastern parts of the USA, is the \\"SuperModified.\\" Super Mods are low-slung, almost body-less modifieds that utilize wings on its chassis to achieve enough downforce to take turns at extremely high speeds. They also feature engines that are offset to the driver's side, also, to aid in taking turns at high speed. There are 4 sanctioning bodies in America that sanction supermodified racing. The New York-based International Supermodified Association (ISMA), is the largest of the four and a true touring series. The Western States Supermodified Racing League (WSSRL) is ISMA's west coast counterpart. The ISMA SuperMods are a bit more technologically advanced, in that the wings attached to the roofs of the cars move. When racing down the straightaways, the wings are almost level. When the car gets to the corners, the back of wing tilts upward, adding downforce to the car. Scale cars A Legends race car =Legends car racing= US Legend Cars International of Charlotte, North Carolina created the Legends series (while they were named 600 Motorsports) as a way of getting more and younger people into racing with affordable cars. The cars were designed to be 5/8-scale 1930s and 1940s coupes and sedans cars raced in the past in the NASCAR Modified Tour. They all feature a tube chassis, and spec 1250 cc Yamaha Motorcycle engines. Dwarf cars in 2008 =Dwarf cars= Dwarf cars are similar to the Legends cars, in that they are scale replicas of vintage race cars. The similarity ends there, as Dwarf cars are true open \\"modified-style\\" cars without fenders, and have a limitation on the engine size.The Western States Dwarf Car Association, begun in 1993, has become one of the most successful racing organizations in history, boasting an average of 80‚Äì100 Dwarf Cars at 4 National, and several regional, events a year.Jack Van Dyke, http://www.dwarfcarracing.com Buying your first \\"Dwarf Car\\" Things you should know! There is also a class of Dwarf Cars that race on dirt called the Vintage Lite Series. They race a mixed field of cars that resemble the vintage cars and some that resemble a scaled down version of the current dirt modified (these cars are often referred to as the MiniMods). ModLites. A ModLite is a 5/8th scale of a Dirt Modifided.

The Copa Libertadores is the most important international football club competition in South America. Throughout the history of the tournament, 22 teams from seven countries have won the competition. Its rich history has been saturated with many legendary matches, iconic players and exceptional teams; from Pe√±arol's historical consegration in 1960, to Coutinho and Pel√© enchanting the world with Santos's magical football, down to Estudiantes's unlikely success at the end of the 1960s, and Club Atl√©tico Independiente being brought to glory in the utmost manner. Juan Carlos Lorenzo's legendary upbringing of Boca Juniors, seeing Flamengo engrave their names on the winner's list at the hands of a squad led by Zico, Ren√© Higuita's memorable saves against Olimpia, S√£o Paulo's time dos sonhos coached by legend Tel√™ Santana and Carlos Bianchi's exploits with Boca Juniors and V√©lez S√°rsfield are some of the more recent stories still talked about till this day. The Copa Libertadores is, arguably, the most important club trophy in the world. The sport was introduced to South America in many different ways. For example, football was introduced to Argentina in the latter half of the 19th century by the British immigrants in Buenos Aires, while Colombia was exposed to football in the early 20th century. An expatriate named Charles William Miller introduced the sport to Brazil. Football was first brought to Chile by the British that exhibited the sport during visits to the commercial ports such as in Valpara√≠so. Dutchman William Paats, who moved from the Netherlands to Asunci√≥n (the capital of Paraguay) in 1888, introduced football to Paraguay, as well as laying the foundations for a classic South American club. The dawn to the Copa Libertadores Rio de Janeiro saw the birth for the idea of the competition. The roots of the competition had existed for a long while the South American spirit of competition at club level was present since the beginning of the century. During the 1930s and 1940s, Argentinean and Uruguayan clubs vied for the Copa R√≠o de La Plata between their respective champions rotating the location of the final every a year Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The delegates of Colo-Colo, after years of insistence, managed to push CONMEBOL into creating the first continental tournament. The Copa de Campeones became the first \\"prototype\\" and it was successfully played in 1948; Vasco da Gama won the competition played entirely in Santiago, Chile. The 1948 South American tournament impulsed, in continent-wide reach, the \\"champions cup\\" model, resulting in the creation of the European Cup in 1955, as confirmed by Jacques Ferran (one of the \\"founding fathers\\" of the European Cup), in a 2015 interview to a Brazilian TV sports programme.Globo Esporte, 10/May/2015: Especial: Liga dos Campe√µes completa 60 anos, e Neymar ajuda a contar essa hist√≥ria. Accessed in 06/December/2015. For all this, the subject of the South American Congress held in 1958 in Rio de Janeiro was not unknown to board members: Ra√∫l Colombo and Eduardo Palma of Argentina, Ferm√≠n Sorhueta, Washington Cataldi, Luis Tr√≥ccoli and Juan Carlos Bracco of Uruguay, doctor Alfredo Gallindo of Bolivia, Lydio Quevedo of Paraguay, Te√≥filo Salinas of Per√∫, Alberto Go√±i of Chile, and Joao Havelange and Abilio D'Almeida of Brazil. The secretary general of the Union des Associations Europ√©ennes de Football, or UEFA, Henry Delaunay, submitted a proposal to the then-head of CONMEBOL Jos√© Ramos de Freitas of Brazil to organize an annual double confrontation between the champions of Europe and South America in what was seen as a welcomed but unneeded incentive. The proposal for the creation of a South American club championship was supported by Argentina and Brazil but was opposed by Uruguay, a country which at that time still had a transcendent pre- eminence in the decision-making of the confederation, sharing political and continental power with Argentina. Brazil had just won their first World Cup and had not yet the privileges or political weight that presently holds. Buenos Aires was the birthplace of the tournament during the 24th South American congress. Uruguay's opposition was based on that \\"the competition being promoted would go against the interest of the South American national- team championships\\". Moreover, Argentina, with the support of Brazil, had proposed that those tournaments should be played every four years instead of every two in early 1957 (in which Uruguay strongly opposed as they were the main architects of the Campeonato Sudamericano). On October 8th 1958, Jo√£o Havelange announced, at a UEFA meeting he attended as an invitee, the creation of Copa de Campeones de America (American Champions Cup, renamed in 1965 as Copa Libertadores), as a South American equivalent of the European Cup, so that the champion clubs of both continental confederations could decide \\"the best club team of the world\\" in the Intercontinental Cup.Spanish newspaper El Mundo Deportivo, 09/Oct/1958, pag. 04. On March 5, 1959, the Chilean delegates insisted and proposed the creation of the South American club tournament at the 24th South American Congress held in Buenos Aires which was approved by the International Affairs Committee. Only the Uruguayans voted against it. The tournament would be named in homage of the heroes of South American history such as Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Manuel Belgrano, Bernardo O'Higgins, Jos√© Miguel Carrera, Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Ram√≥n Castilla, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo, among others: the Copa Libertadores de America. That was the last deed of Jos√© Ramos de Freitas as president of CONMEBOL who relinquished his position to the newly elected president, Uruguayan Sorhueta Fermin. In Montevideo, the idea was approved with the presence of all 10 CONMEBOL representatives to finally begin the development of the tournament with the first edition being played by seven participants. The club President of Pe√±arol, Washington Cataldi, explained years later: Beginnings =1960-1961: Pe√±arol's Historic Justice= The first entrants of the inaugural edition included seven national champions: Bahia of Brazil, Jorge Wilstermann of Bolivia, Millonarios of Colombia, Olimpia of Paraguay, Pe√±arol of Uruguay, San Lorenzo of Argentina and Universidad de Chile of Chile. Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela did not send any representatives. Carlos Borges of Pe√±arol scored the first goal of the tournament, with teammate and legendary figure Alberto Spencer scoring the first hat-trick. They will become fundamental figures for Pe√±arol as the manyas begun their journey with a crushing 7‚Äì1 victory over Jorge Wilstermann in the first leg. After a 1‚Äì1 draw in the second leg, they progressed to the semifinal stage where they faced the San Lorenzo of Jos√© Sanfilippo; after drawing both matches of the semifinal series, the boardmembers of the Cicl√≥n allowed the tie-breaking match to be held at Pe√±arol's home stadium, the Estadio Centenario, in exchange for economic incentives. This move was quietly criticized by the San Lorenzo players and they went out of the tournament after a 2‚Äì1 defeat. In the finals, Pe√±arol would face Olimpia with the first match being played in Montevideo. The Paraguayans managed to keep the score goalless until 11 minutes from full- time when Spencer broke the deadlock to take a 1‚Äì0 victory to Asunci√≥n; and in a highly charged atmosphere in the Manuel Ferreira stadium, Luis Cubilla scored at the 83rd minute to tie a match Pe√±arol was losing since the first half, and give his club the honor of becoming the first ever champions of the competition. The Pe√±arol team that became the first ever champions of the competition. The second edition of the tournament saw Ecuador and Peru send a representative to the tournament. Pe√±arol opened their title defense with a 5-0 thrashing over Universitario; the large scoreline allowed the champions to cruise to the semifinals with a 2‚Äì0 defeat to face Olimpia, in a rematch of the previous year's final. However, Pe√±arol swept aside Olimpia with a 3‚Äì1 victory at home and a 1‚Äì2 triumph away in order to contest their second, consecutive final, this time against Brazilian giants Palmeiras. Like last year's final, Pe√±arol managed a 1‚Äì0 victory in the first leg thanks to another late goal from Alberto Spencer at the 89th minute. In the second leg, Pe√±arol managed to come away with a 1‚Äì1 tie to retain the title. Due to the great contributions made by Pe√±arol's board directors in the creation of the Copa Libertadores, the success of the Manyas in this two editions are widely considered a \\"historical justice\\" well earned. =1962-1963: The Santasticos= During the early years, Pe√±arol was the dominating team in the South American club football, and managed to reach the final for the third consecutive year when they faced the Brazilian champions Santos. At that time, Santos was led by Brazilian football superstar Pel√©. The club went on to win the Ta√ßa Brasil that previous year, crushing Bahia in the finals; Pel√© finished as top scorer of the tournament with 9 goals. The victory allowed Santos to participate in the Copa Libertadores. The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition, which was swept through the sublime football of the ballet blanco led by Pel√©, Coutinho, Lima, Zito, Dorval and Pepe, considered by some the best club team of all times. Santos' most successful club season started in 1962;Anibal Massaini Neto (Director/Producer), (2004). Pel√© Eterno [Documentary film]. Brazil: Anima Produ√ß√µes Audiovisuais Ltda. International: Universal Studios Home Video. the team was seeded in Group 1 alongside Cerro Porte√±o and Deportivo Municipal, winning every match of their group but one (a 1‚Äì1 away tie vs Cerro), while performing a 9‚Äì1 rout of Cerro. Santos defeated Universidad Cat√≥lica in the semifinals and met defending champions Pe√±arol in the finals in which Pel√© scored another brace in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club. Coutinho and Pel√© finished as the first and second best scorer of the competition with 6 and 4 goals, respectively. As the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semifinal stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco managed to retain the title in spectacular fashion after impressive victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pel√© helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained legends such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with an agonizing last-minute goal in the first leg of the semifinals and bring the match to 1-1. In the second leg, Pel√© produced one of his best performances as a footballer with a hat-trick in the Est√°dio do Maracan√£ as Santos crushed Botafogo 0‚Äì4 in the second leg. Appearing in their second consecutive final, Santos started the series by winning 3‚Äì2 in the first leg thanks to a brace by Coutinho and defeating the Boca Juniors of Jos√© Sanfilippo and Antonio Ratt√≠n 1‚Äì2 in La Bombonera, with another goal from Pel√© and Coutinho each, becoming the first Brazilian team (until 2017 Gr√™mio's victory over Lan√∫s) to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pel√© finished the tournament as the scorer runner-up with 5 goals, while Coutinho finished third with 3 goals. =1964-1965: Independiente's M√≠stica Copera= An Argentine team wrote down its name in the history of the tournament for the first time in 1964. Independiente knocked-out the defending champions Santos in semi-final, and later became the first Argentine team to win the competition. =1966: Pe√±arol's third victory and River Plate's disaster= Pe√±arol winning the Copa Libertadores 1966 Pe√±arol lost to the Argentine side Independiente in final of the previous year. In 1966, they successfully revenged by defeating another Argentine team, River Plate, in the extra time of a play-off and clinched their third tournament championship. Colombian and Brazilian clubs did not participate in this tournament. =1967: The miracle of La Academia= The championship of Pe√±arol in 1966 did not stop the Argentine teams' domination in the era. In 1967, another Argentine team won the title: Racing Club. They defeated another Uruguayan team Nacional 2‚Äì1 in a play-off and were crowned the South American champions for the first time. Brazil's runner-up Santos declined to play in that years tournament. =1968-1969: The rise of Estudiantes de La Plata= Starting from 1968, the era of another Argentine team started. Not being one of the traditional \\"big five\\" teams in Argentine football, Estudiantes L.P. broke the domination of the \\"big five\\" teams in Argentina in 1967 by winning their first domestic league title. They went on to win the Copa Libertadores in 1968, defeating Palmeiras in the final. Though they did not win the Primera Divisi√≥n Argentina in the following years, they continued their success in the continental tournament. Coached by Osvaldo Zubeld√≠a, and led by star players like Carlos Bilardo, Juan Ram√≥n Ver√≥n and Oscar Malbernat, they won the Copa Libertadores again in 1969 and 1970, becoming the first team to win the title for three consecutive years.

However, they failed to clinch the title again this time and were defeated 2‚Äì0 in the play- off match of the final. =1972-1975: Independiente domination= In 1972, Argentine team Independiente returned to the title race. With star players such as Francisco S√°, Jos√© Omar Pastoriza, Ricardo Bochini and Daniel Bertoni, they once again were crowned the champions after seven years since their last championship. With their strong squad, they conquered the continent for the next three years, winning a record four consecutive titles. =1976: Breakthrough of Cruzeiro= Brazilian teams had not won a title since 1963. In 1976, Brazilian league runners-up Cruzeiro broke through the Argentine dominance. Although the Argentine champions River Plate could still enter the final, they were not able to capture the first continental title in their club history. Cruzeiro defeated River Plate in the play-off of the final and were crowned the new champions. =1977-1978: Boca Juniors double= Following the breakthrough of 1976, Cruzeiro were again in the final of the 1977 session. However, they could not make a double and were defeated by another Argentine team, Boca Juniors, which were famous for their defense led by the goalkeeper Hugo Gatti. Boca re-captured the title in 1978 by winning over Deportivo Cali, the first Colombian finalist of the competition. =1979: Olimpia's first golden era= Before 1979, no teams from countries other than Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay had ever won a title. However, in 1979, Olimpia successfully brought the trophy back to Paraguay. They defeated Boca Juniors, the champions of the two previous years, in the final and became the first champions not coming from the aforementioned three countries. Their conquest of Boca also ended the Argentine dominance of the past 15 years.

Colombian team Am√©rica de Cali were, again, the losing team in the final. =1987-1988: Uruguayan football's fall from grace= Diego Aguirre (la fiera) scored in the final against Am√©rica de Cali, in the third game, in extra time, 2 seconds from the final. Am√©rica de Cali entered the final for the third consecutive year. Nonetheless, they were once again the runners-up of the tournament. In 1987, they were defeated by the Uruguayan champions C.A. Pe√±arol 1‚Äì0 in the play-off. Nacional, the rival of Pe√±arol, followed suit in the following year. They won their third title by defeating Newell's Old Boys, a first-time finalist, 3‚Äì1 aggregately. Until today, these are the last two titles won by Uruguayan teams. =1989: A dramatic victory for the Pacific= In 1989, Atl√©tico Nacional became the first Colombian continental champions. They defeated Olimpia in the final, which was for the first time entirely competed by teams not coming from Argentina, Brazil or Uruguay. Renaissance =1990: Olimpia's second golden era= Olimpia continued striving for their second title after 1979. They entered the final once more in 1990, and led by players such as Ra√∫l Vicente Amarilla, Gabriel Gonz√°lez and Ever Hugo Almeida they won the trophy again by beating Ecuadorian team Barcelona 3‚Äì1 in the final. =1991: Colo-Colo for Chile= In 1991, for the third year in a row the final did not involve teams from Argentina, Brazil or Uruguay.

History  As a young man, George Steiner worked as a towel delivery boy for Johnson's towel route in Lincoln, Nebraska. When Johnson lost his contract to have his towels laundered by inmates at the state penitentiary in 1889, he offered to sell to George his towel route for $50.80- half down, half later. He purchased the towel business and as his business grew, George turned for help to his younger brother whom he made an equal partner. Together they made deliveries from a green and white hand cart they pushed through the city streets. It wasn't long before the hand cart was upgraded to a horse-drawn wagon. George named his business Lincoln Towel and Apron Supply Company and later became known as American Linen. Business continued to grow and the Lincoln business expanded to Salt Lake City, UT and Minneapolis, Minnesota in the late 1800s and Vancouver, British Columbia in the early 1920s establishing the Canadian Linen Supply Company. Today the American Linen Supply Company is known as AmeriPride and serves over 150,000 customers daily. =Timeline= *1889 - Company founded by George and Frank Steiner in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. *Late 1800s - Expansion and opening of Salt Lake City and Minneapolis branches *1925 - Expansion into Canada with Vancouver branch *1935 - Minneapolis Linen Supply Company‚Äôs uniform-manufacturing plant opens *1948 - Consolidation of 19 branches into one corporation under the American Linen Supply Company *1960s and 1970s - Multiple acquisitions made across the U.S. and Canada *1998 - Company name changes to AmeriPride Services Inc. in the U.S., Canadian Linen and Apparel Services in Canada, and Quebec Linge in the province of Quebec *2007 - Company opens Toronto Central facility *2009 - Bill Evans appointed as first non- family CEO References  External links  * AmeriPride * Canadian Linen * Quebec Linge Category:Business services companies of the United States Category:Laundry businesses Category:Business services companies established in 1889 Category:American companies established in 1889 Category:Companies based in Minnetonka, Minnesota Category:1889 establishments in Nebraska Category:2018 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"AmeriPride Services"},{"id":"18115238","text":"Titanic Memorial can refer to: * Titanic Memorial, Belfast * Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic, Liverpool * Titanic Memorial (New York City) * Titanic Engineers' Memorial, Southampton * Titanic Memorial (Washington, D.C.)

The Credit Mission was an Indian Mission on the Credit River in Upper Canada. Funded with the proceeds from Purchase #22 or #23, building began in 1826 under the leadership of Peter Jones. When construction began, about 200 Indians lived at the settlement in temporary structures. Thirty log cabins were constructed on the of reserved land. That year Egerton Ryerson was assigned to the settlement as a Methodist missionary. A Methodist church was soon built, as was a school. John Jones was the school's first teacher. In the spring of 1827 of land were planted with crops, mostly corn and potatoes. In 1829, after the death of one of the band's three chiefs John Cameron, Peter Jones was elected to fill his position. In 1830, John Jones retired from the position of schoolteacher, as he was afflicted with Tuberculosis. In an 1836 inspection of the settlement, Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head called it the \\"cleanest, neatest and most civilised of all the Indian settlements he had seen.\\"Jones (1860), page 379 Although the provincial government had initially been favorable to the settlement, relations darkened as the Indians of the Credit clung to the Methodist faith under pressure from the province to convert to Anglicanism. During the 1830s, Lieutenant Governor Sir Francis Bond Head began to plan to remove the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission to Manitoulin Island. Chief Peter Jones travelled to England, meeting with Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg and Queen Victoria to prevent the move, as Manitoulin was too rocky to farm, and the settlers would have been forced to revert to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Although the Colonial office blocked Bond Head's plan, the Credit Band did not receive the title deeds that Victoria authorised her minister to grant them, and remained vulnerable to the encroachment of white settlers. In 1840, John Jones was elected one of the three chiefs of the Credit band. In 1847, unable to secure land rights to the mission, the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission relocated to New Credit. Title to that land was possessed by the Six Nations, who donated the land to the Mississaugas of Credit.

The line runs along 207th Street in Upper Manhattan and along the continuous Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. The line started operating in the early 1900s as a streetcar line between Inwood in Manhattan and Belmont in the Bronx. In 1948, the streetcar route was converted into a bus route, operated by the New York City Transit Authority under the subsidiary Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (MaBSTOA). Throughout the late 20th century, several separate bus routes were combined to form the Bx12. The bus line became the first bus rapid transit route to enter service in the city in 2008, when the Bx12 Limited became the Bx12 Select Bus Service (SBS). Both the Bx12 local and SBS carry over 45,000 riders each weekday. The total ridership in 2014 was 15,812,906, making the route the busiest citywide. Route description and service =Current bus service= A Bx12 SBS bus (with special livery not yet applied yet) picks up customers at the Eastchester Road stop along Pelham Parkway. The Bx12 runs crosstown from Inwood in Manhattan to various areas in the northeastern Bronx. The line, eastward, begins at the Inwood‚Äì207th Street subway station () on Broadway and West 207th Street. The Bx12 then loops around via Isham Street and Sherman Avenue and rejoins West 207th Street, continuing across the University Heights Bridge into University Heights. The route runs along Fordham Road through Fordham Center, Fordham Plaza, and Belmont until the road becomes Pelham Parkway near the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Garden in Bronx Park. The route then runs along Pelham Parkway's main roadway to Pelham Bay, where it takes a somewhat circuitous route. The line turns off Pelham Parkway onto Burr Avenue stopping at the Pelham Bay Park subway station. From here, the Bx12 services that do not terminate here make a U-turn and join the New England Thruway to Bay Plaza or veer east along Shore Road to Orchard Beach. At the Pelham Bay Park station, Manhattan-bound buses use stops directly adjacent to where Bay Plaza and Orchard Beach-bound buses pick up passengers‚Äîalong southbound Amendola Place. Westbound buses use the southernmost two stops, while terminating eastbound locals and buses towards Bay Plaza and Orchard Beach use the northernmost two stops closest to the subway. The setup requires westbound service to make a U-turn onto the New England Thruway before heading onto Pelham Parkway. During the daytime and evening hours, local service runs between Sedgwick/Webb Avenue in University Heights and the Pelham Bay Park subway station (). Some local service also originates from Belmont Avenue and 182nd Street in Belmont during the afternoons on school days. Most service between Manhattan and Bay Plaza is served by Bx12 Select buses during that time, although some local buses continue to Bay Plaza. During the summer, Bx12 local buses are extended to Orchard Beach, with all weekend service operating to/from Inwood during the summer. During the overnight hours, all service runs local, serving the entire route with the exception of Bay Plaza. Buses instead terminate on Edson Avenue, in front of the Gun Hill Bus Depot, as the shopping center is closed during these times. = Select Bus Service = The Bx12 is New York City's first bus rapid transit service, marketed as Select Bus Service, which began on June 29, 2008. Selected as the Bronx corridor for the pilot project in 2004, the MTA, New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) drew up plans to convert the Bx12's limited service to BRT. The route was selected for the project mainly because of its mostly straight crosstown route through the Bronx, intersecting with seven different subway lines and all Metro-North lines. Buses are outfitted with special identification (including a special blue wrap and blue route signs) and traffic signal prioritization was enacted along the route, timing traffic signals in favor of the bus. The NYCDOT also added dedicated bus lanes painted in maroon-red along Pelham Parkway and Fordham Road, with signs indicating that the lanes are bus-only from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays, along with additional police enforcement. Off-board fare collection, via MetroCard fare machines and coin meters, allows passengers with proof of payment to board through any door. Bx12 Select Bus Service operates daily, from around 6am to 10pm weekdays, 7am-11pm weekends.  Stops  The Bx12 route (in light blue), as of Summer 2012 History =Streetcar service= The Fordham Road/Pelham Parkway service began as a streetcar line operated by the Union Railway Company, a subsidiary of the Third Avenue Railway, and was the last Union Railway franchise to be constructed. In February 1903, the company announced plans to construct a two- track line along Pelham Avenue (the former name of Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway) between Bronx Park and Pelham Bay Park, running through largely undeveloped land and parkland. Called the Pelham Avenue Line, its western terminus would be at Third Avenue in modern Fordham Plaza, at the Fordham station of the then-New York Central Railroad (now the Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line) and the entrance of what was then St. John's College (now Fordham University's Rose Hill campus). Its eastern end would be at the Pelham Bridge in Pelham Bay. By 1904, the line was running along Fordham Avenue and Pelham Avenue (today's Fordham Road) between Sedgwick Avenue in University Heights and Third Avenue in Fordham. That year, the company released plans to extend the line west across the yet-to-be-constructed University Heights Bridge to Broadway and 207th Street in Inwood, Manhattan. By fall 1908, after the opening of the bridge, the Union Railway petitioned for an extension west to Manhattan, and east to Pelham Bay Park. By 1909, the planned eastern extension was truncated to Southern Boulevard, with both extension plans delayed due to deadlock in negotiations with the city. In 1910, the company once again petitioned the New York City Board of Estimate and the New York State Public Service Commission for a western extension to Manhattan, and for an eastern extension from Southern Boulevard to the eastern edge of Bronx Park (at about Boston Road, White Plains Road, and Bronx Park East). The Manhattan extension was finally granted in June 1910. Service across the bridge to Inwood began on November 29, 1910. In late 1916, the railway petitioned for another extension along either Vermilyea Avenue or Nagle Avenue, and Dyckman Street west to the ferry terminal at the end of Dyckman Street, to connect with ferries to New Jersey and upstate New York, particularly the Palisades region and Palisades Interstate Park. The franchise was granted in December of that year. The extension was initially opposed since many narrow streets in the area were narrow. Later, the Union Railway sought to annul the franchise agreement, which was opposed by the local Dyckman (Inwood/Washington Heights) community due to growing business interests created by the line. The extension was never implemented. =Conversion to bus service= New Flyer D60 high-floor bus on the Bx12 SBS at Orchard Beach in 2008. High-floor buses are no longer present in SBS service, which no longer serves Orchard Beach. Beginning in the 1920s, many streetcar lines in the Bronx, Manhattan, and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of the city's three primary transit companies in June 1940. That year, the railroad company began relinquishing its trolley franchises with the city, to be replaced by buses operated by the subsidiary Surface Transportation Corporation. The 207th Street Crosstown Line was replaced with the then-Bx19 bus service operating between Broadway-207th Street and Southern Boulevard on January 25, 1948, the same date as the motorization of the Bronx and Van Cortlandt Parks Crosstown Line (today's ). The route would be operated by Surface Transit until 1956, and by the New York City Omnibus Corporation (later under the brand Fifth Avenue Coach Lines) until the company's routes were taken over by the New York City Transit Authority through its subsidiary Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (MaBSTOA) in 1962 after a strike. As the years progressed, service was eventually consolidated from multiple routes, and was given a single label, the Bx12. The route saw extensions east to City Island, seasonal service to Orchard Beach, and a branch to the Bartow-Pell Mansion in the Pelham Bay Golf Course, along with the introduction of limited-stop service on weekdays. The Orchard Beach branches were labeled Bx12A and Bx12B until July 1, 1974, when they were merged into the Bx12 designation. On April 21, 1989, the New York City Transit Authority presented two proposals to rationalize the eastern terminals of service on the Bx12 to the MTA Board for approval. The first proposal called for the discontinuation of the summer only Bx12 Golf Course Shuttle, which ran between Orchard Beach and Pelham Bay Golf Course between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., since it was only used by an average of ten daily passengers. This change took effect in June 1989. The second proposal up for approval was the extension of Bx12 trips that terminated at the Pelham Bay Park subway station to the new Gun Hill Depot at Bartow Avenue and the New England Thruway when it opened in September 1989. This change was intended to rationalize service and establish a relief point for bus operators. While it increased net costs, it increased operating efficiencies. Service to City Island remained until around 1990, when through service was discontinued and replaced with a dedicated route from City Island to Pelham Bay, the current . The resulting service pattern remains in effect today, with some minor adjustments. In 1988, due to the reconstruction of the University Heights Bridge, the Bx12 began detouring to cross into Manhattan via Bailey Avenue and the Broadway Bridge at 225th Street, as opposed to the direct path via 207th Street. The route was restored in September 1994 as the vehicle weight restriction on the bridge was removed. In 1989, limited-stop service began on the Bx12, saving up to five minutes per trip. In January 1995, an additional limited stop was added at Jacobi Hospital, and the hours of limited-stop service were expanded from 6:57 ‚Äì 8:39 a.m. and 4:55 ‚Äì 6:41 p.m. to 6:30 ‚Äì 9:30 a.m. and 4 ‚Äì 6:30 p.m.. Extending the span of the limited-stop service to operate all day between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. was considered, with a plan to revisit the idea if the increase in the span of limited-stop service was successful. The span of the Bx12 was extended to operate all day between 6:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. on September 8, 1997. Exactly one year later, on September 8, 1998, the Bx12 began stopping in the Bay Plaza Shopping Center. In 2004, the MTA in conjunction with the NYCDOT and NYSDOT, performed an initial study on bus rapid transit, with 80 corridors studied citywide. Five routes were prioritized, including the Bx12 route. On June 29, 2008, the Bx12 Limited was converted into the Bx12 Select Bus Service. Initially, during summer months Bx12 SBSs alternated between Bay Plaza and Orchard Beach. In 2009, Bx12 locals were extended to Orchard Beach during summer months, with all SBSs terminating at Bay Plaza. Summer local service to Inwood was also added at this time. The total ridership in 2009 was 14,736,515, ranking the route third in ridership citywide and the busiest in the Bronx. In March 2013, the high-floor articulated buses on the SBS route were replaced with low-floor articulated buses with three sets of doors to improve boarding and alighting of passengers.

The work was performed during the years 1474‚Äì1479. The sanctuary stands on the highest hill of the Basso Monferrato; later it would form the focal pont of the Sacro Monte di Crea. The Master of Crea has in the past been identified with various known painters from north-west Italy, and particularly with Macrino d'Alba. However, stylistic similarities with the early work of the Casalese painter Giovanni Martino Spanzotti have led today‚Äôs experts to identify him with that painter‚Äôs father, Pietro, or (more probably) with his brother, Francesco. The chapel frescos On the rear wall of the chapel is a triptych portraying in fresco the Madonna col Bambino ed Angeli musicanti, affiancata da Santi (Virgin and child, with angelic musicians, flanked by saints) and, on the two wings, donor portraits of Guglielmo VIII Paleologo, his wife Maria di Foix and their children. The side walls depict scenes of torture from the Passio di Santa Margherita di Antiochia (Saint Margaret of Antioch): in one the saint faces trial by fire, in another she is made to stand in a cauldron of boiling water.

Los Angeles County, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), was a 6-3 decision of the United States Supreme Court. The Court held that the complete destruction of the value of property constituted a \\"taking\\" under the Fifth Amendment even if that taking was temporary and the property was later restored. Background First English Evangelical Lutheran Church operated a retreat center for handicapped children on its property within the Angeles National Forest. They called the camp Lutherglen. After a serious flood destroyed all the buildings in Lutherglen, the County of Los Angeles adopted an interim ordinance prohibiting building within the floodplain. The Church sued seeking damages, alleging the ordinance denied them all use of Lutherglen. The Superior Court struck the allegation, reasoning that damages were unavailable for an inverse condemnation. In California a plaintiff was procedurally first required to get the court to declare a challenged regulation was excessive. After the regulation was declared excessive the regulator could discontinue the regulation or pay just compensation. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision and the California Supreme Court denied review. Opinion of the Court The six-member majority reversed and remanded the case to be considered with the struck allegations reinstated. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist‚Äôs logic turns on a concern that allowing a regulator to simply discontinue a regulation declared to be a taking creates a temporary taking for the period of time the challenged regulation was in force. This temporary takings question had been in contention since the Court had affirmed on other grounds the case establishing the California approach, Agins v. City of Tiburon. In the seven years since Agins, the Court had heard three cases involving the California approach, all of which had been denied review by the California Supreme Court, only to dividedly affirm or dismiss on finality issues. This case had its own jurisdictional problems, not least of which that the plaintiff‚Äôs less than clear pleadings had only invoked the California state constitution. Nevertheless, the Court found itself ready and able to dispose of the temporary takings issue. The Court held that a temporary regulatory takings requires just compensation, as in any other kind of takings. In reaching his conclusion, Rehnquist relied heavily on WWII physical takings cases, where the government was required to pay compensation for property it had temporarily commandeered. Dissent Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Blackmun and O‚ÄôConnor, dissented. After noting the ‚Äúlitigation explosion‚Äù the Court's reasoning will cause, the dissent points out that even if the Church's allegation are not struck, plaintiff's claim is so weak it will be summarily rejected regardless. They also point out that the severe floods in the floodplain may poise a greater obstacle to rebuilding Lutherglen than the county ordinance. Given that the Church has such a weak case, the dissenters doubt the propriety of using struck complaint allegations as a ‚Äúspringboard‚Äù to address novel constitutional questions. Writing alone, Stevens probes the distinction between physical and regulatory takings. Acknowledging as a matter of course that there can be temporary physical takings, he posits that the ‚Äúthree-dimensional‚Äù nature of regulations make them too uncertain to be treated the same as physical invasions. Stevens concludes by noting that procedural due process should be adequate to protect property owners from a malevolent local zoning board.

The word Garryowen is a transliteration of the Irish Garra√≠ Eoin - \\"the garden of Owen\\" - and relates to the association in the 12th century between St John's Church and the Knights Templar whose house in Limerick was dedicated to John the Baptist. In medieval times Garryowen was located just outside the Irishtown area of the walled city of Limerick. The citadel (located in the grounds of St. John's Hospital) was the Irishtown's main fortification. In 1690, it was the scene of a heroic Jacobite defence-the battle of the breach-which was fought nearby during the Williamite War of 1688‚Äì91. The sally port of the original stronghold has been incorporated into the structure of St John's Hospital. Other parts of the city walls can still be seen within the hospital grounds. The Citadel remained in use as a military barracks until 1752. St John's Gate was situated on the main roadway, nearby, but no trace of it now remains. St John's Cathedral is located in the area and dates from 1861 and has Ireland's tallest spire at 94m. St John's Hospital is located adjacent to the cathedral which dates back to 1780 and was founded by Lady Hartstonge and other benefactors as a Fever and Lock Hospital and treated epidemics during the Great Famine (1845-1847). St John's Square is located across the way from the cathedral and was Limerick‚Äôs first example of fashionable architecture and civic spaces and was completed in 1751.Limerick's historic John's Square reopens after ‚Ç¨1 million redevelopment Limerick Leader For a time the area was considered one of Limerick's most fashionable residential areas. Garryowen Football Club, a prominent Rugby Union club in Ireland's AIB League has its origins in the area; however it is no longer located in the neighbourhood of Garryowen but rather in the Dooradoyle area of the Limerick Suburbs. The Markets Field was Garryowen's home ground until 1958 when they moved to Dooradoyle. The Markets Field has since been in use as a greyhound racing stadium until July 2010. It is the home of Limerick FC following the acquisition of the grounds by the JP McManus foundation. Today the area has a working class character, with a lot of housing and estates dating from the 1950s onwards. In popular culture * Garryowen Football Club, is one of Ireland's most successful Rugby Union Clubs. * The garryowen kick; a garryowen is a very high up and under kick (named after the rugby club) designed to put the opposing team under pressure, by allowing the kicking team time to arrive under and compete for the high ball. * The Garryowen air, is an Irish tune for a quickstep dance. This song emerged in the late 18th century, when it was a drinking song of rich young roisterers in Limerick. It obtained immediate popularity in the British Army through the 5th (Royal Irish) Lancers. * Garryowen was also the title of a 1920s film. It concerns an impoverished Irish gentleman who tries to rescue his family from ruin by running his horse Garryowen at the Epsom Derby. * \\"Sean South of Garryowen\\", is an Irish republican ballad written by Sean Costelloe to the tune of another republican ballad \\"Roddy McCorley\\" and popularised by the Wolfe Tones.

Kelly made his first appearance for the team during the 1952 championship and became a regular player over the next decade. During that time he won one All-Ireland winner's medal and three Leinster winner's medals. He captained Kilkenny to the All-Ireland title in 1957. At club level Kelly enjoyed a successful career with Bennettsbridge, winning seven county club championship winners' medals. Playing career =Club= Kelly played his club hurling with his local Bennettsbridge club and enjoyed much success. He helped 'the bridge' to the county junior championship in 1948 and 1951 before the club moved up to the senior grade. Kelly later added seven county senior championship titles to his collection in 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1962. =Inter-county= Kelly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Kilkenny in 1953. That year he won his first Leinster title following a victory over Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final pitted Kilkenny against Galway. In a close and exciting game, the men from the West secured a one-point victory by 3‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì10. Four years later in 1957 Kelly was appointed captain of the Kilkenny senior team.Kilkenny GAA Bible That year he collected his second Leinster title following a victory over All-Ireland champions Wexford. This allowed Kelly's side to advance directly to the championship decider where Waterford provided the opposition. In a high- scoring game between these two neighbours, Waterford took a six-point lead with fifteen minutes left in the game. Then Kilkenny fought back with goals by Mick Kenny and Billy Dwyer. Kelly played a captain's role by scoring the winning point for Kilkenny. A 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì12 victory gave Kelly an All-Ireland medal and the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Two years later in 1959 Kelly came on as a substitute to collect his third Leinster winners' medal. The subsequent ALl-Ireland final saw Kilkenny and Waterford do battle once again. The game ended in a draw, forcing both sides to return to Croke Park four weeks later for a replay. Kelly, who played no part in the drawn game, came on as a substitute once again. On that occasion Waterford secured their second All-Ireland title. In 1960 Kelly was appointed Kilkenny captain once again. That year, however, his side were defeated by arch-rivals Wexford in the Leinster final. Kelly retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards. =Provincial= Kelly also lined out with Leinster in the inter- provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1953 and collected his only Railway Cup medal in 1954. Personal life One of eleven children, Michael Kelly was born in the townland of Killarney, Thomastown, County Kilkenny. After attending the local national school he was sent, as a boarder, to St. Francis' College, run by the Capuchin Friars at Rochestown in Cork. He left at the age of sixteen and returned to live near the village of Bennettsbridge where he combined farming with a job in Mosse's flour milling company.

Millership made his name as a centre-half but he originally was a centre forward in his early playing days. Early days Millership was born in the small mining village of Warsop Vale in Nottinghamshire on 8 June 1910. As a youth he excelled at both football and cricket, playing his football for Warsop Main, Welbeck Athletic and Shirebrook Town F.C.. Upon leaving school he worked at Warsop colliery and was soon approached by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, but their effort to sign him was rebuffed by Millership who wanted to further his football career. Bradford Park Avenue In January 1928 he was invited for a trial at Bradford Park Avenue and was promptly signed making three appearances in the remainder of that season as Park Avenue lifted the Third Division North championship. The following season Millership only made two appearances and it was not until the 1929‚Äì30 season that he became a regular in the Park Avenue forward line scoring 12 goals in 25 appearances including a goal in the FA cup fourth round upset of Derby County and another in the 1‚Äì5 fifth round defeat against League champions Sheffield Wednesday on 15 February 1930. Despite the heavy defeat, Wednesday manager Bob Brown was sufficiently impressed with Millership to sign him for the Hillsborough club the following month for a fee of ¬£2,600.1930 Giant Killers Sheffield Wednesday Millership played six games at inside right in the remainder of the 1929‚Äì30 season as Wednesday retained their Division One title. However, for the next three season Millership's first team opportunities were limited as he was kept out of the side by ace inside forwards Jimmy Seed, Harry Burgess and latterly Ronnie Starling. In the 1931‚Äì32 season he had the fine record of 14 goals in 17 appearances including four goals in a 7‚Äì0 FA Cup 4th round victory over A.F.C. Bournemouth in January 1932 and a League hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers in the same month. Millership's big chance in the Wednesday team came when it was decided to play him as a centre half towards the end of the 1932‚Äì33 season as a temporary replacement for the injured Tony Leach. Millership revelled in the central defensive position, his sturdy play earning him the nickname \\"Battleship\\" from Wednesday fans and by the end of 1933 he had made the position his own. He was Wednesday's first choice centre half for the next five seasons, playing in the 1935 FA Cup Final victory over West Brom and coming close to earning an England cap, playing in an international trial in March 1935. Millership lost his centre half place to Harry Hanford in the last full season before World War II (1938‚Äì39), however he played 12 games as a stand in centre forward, scoring eight goals when Doug Hunt was injured. Millership captained Wednesday throughout the war playing in 155 wartime games, scoring 12 goals. He played in the 1943 War Cup Final defeat to Blackpool F.C.. He also played as a guest for Doncaster Rovers and Sheffield United during the war.Since 1888. Gives career statistics.SWFC Archive. Gives statistics of Sheffield Wednesday career. Later life Millership played on in Non-League football after the war signing for Denaby United in May 1946. It was at this time that Millership can claim to have discovered the 17-year-old Derek Dooley who scored a hat trick for Lincoln City reserves whilst playing against Denaby. Millership was quickly on the phone to Wednesday to inform them of Dooley's talent and he was signed in great haste by Wednesday manager Eric Taylor. In 1948 Millership returned to coal mining at Arkwright Town colliery and stayed there until his retirement in 1969.

The EN 15038 standard ensured the consistent quality of the service. In 2015, CEN withdrew EN 15038 and adopted ISO 17100 as a European standard. Many European translation companies have long felt the need for a reliable method of demonstrating the quality of the services they provide to their customers. Many sought ISO 9001 certification as a demonstration of their commitment to quality management systems. However, as the ISO 9001 standard does not address the sort of translation-specific processes which many translators consider important in determining quality outcomes, this standard did not become widely accepted as a \\"guarantee of quality\\" in the industry. In 2006, a quality standard, specifically written for the translation industry, EN 15038, was published by CEN, the European Committee for Standardization. This was a serious attempt to provide certification of translation-specific quality management using independent, on-site audits by recognized certification bodies. This standard is gaining acceptance worldwide and the European Union has begun including it as a benchmark in its tender specifications. Background There have been a number of initiatives in Europe to create a universal quality standard that could benchmark the quality of the translation services and gain recognition through independent audit certification. This includes the Italian UNI 10574 Standard, the Austrian √ñnorm D 1200 and √ñnorm D 1201 Standards, the Dutch Taalmerk Standard and the German DIN 2345 Standard. In 1999 the EUATC (European Union of Associations of Translation Companies) saw the need to develop an industry specific quality standard. This initiative built on previous standards which had been established by some national associations of translation companies. This standard was the first European wide initiative. In 2003 the EUATC took this standard to the next level. They started working with CEN, the European standards body, in April 2003 with the aim of creating a certifiable quality process standard for translation. The public consultation period started in September 2004 and EN 15038 was published by May 2006. The EUATC is made up of national associations of translation companies throughout Europe and these national associations have been translating the standard into their own language and cooperating with their national standardisation bodies for publication and certification by independent third party auditors. Scope and definitions An area not covered by EN 15038 is the interpreting and service matrix. While the committee developing the standard recognised the value of including Interpretation within the scope of the standard, it was felt that managing interpreting quality would make developing the standard more difficult and it would extend the process. Within the translation industry many words are used to describe different processes from one company to another. It is very important for anyone who intends to implement EN 15038 that they understand the meaning of the terms and definitions used in the standard. The standard also uses the terms ‚Äòshould‚Äô and ‚Äòshall‚Äô. When the word ‚Äòshall‚Äô is used, it is obligatory while ‚Äòshould‚Äô is used for recommended. The following are some of the terms which are defined in the standard: * Translation Service Provider (TSP) ‚Äì An organisation or person who supplies translation services.

Roughly bounded by Eleventh Street, Broadway, Nineteenth and Sixteenth Streets, and Market and Post Office Streets, the area has one of the best-preserved and largest concentrations of 19th-century residential architecture in Texas. It was developed mainly at a time when Galveston was the state's preeminent port. The historic district, designated locally in 1970, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description and history Galveston's history as a port city began in 1830, when Mexico established a custom house on Galveston Island. After the Texas Republic was established in 1836, Galveston Island was developed as the republic's principal port. Its street network was platted in 1838, and by 1850 it was the second largest port on the Gulf Coast (after New Orleans). This early growth included the construction of a number of Greek Revival houses in the eastern end of the island, some of which still stand. The city experienced significant growth after the American Civil War, but its growth was curtailed by the growth of Houston as a competing port, and then by the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which devastated the city and effectively ended its significance as a major port. The eastern end of Galveston Island became its preeminent residential district, where the city's civic and business leaders built their houses. Wilbur Cherry, an early newspaper published in the city, built a house on Cherry Street in 1852 which is one of the district's oldest. The grandest mansion in the area is the so-called Bishop's Palace, completed in 1893 for politician and lawyer Walter Gresham. Most of the district's 550-plus buildings are residences that show Victorian architectural styles, although a number of relatively unaltered examples of the Greek Revival survive from its early days. The East End was protected as a local historic district in 1970. Significant and representative properties, some of which are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL), include: *Bishop's Palace (NRHP #70000746, RTHL #139), 1402 Broadway St. *George Washington Grover House (RTHL #7479), 1520 Market St. *Isaac Heffron House (RTHL #18528), 1509 Postoffice St. See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Texas *National Register of Historic Places listings in Galveston County, Texas *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Galveston County References External links *Search on \\"Galveston TX\\" yields many photosets, some from this district, at Historic American Buildings Survey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Galveston County, Texas Category:History of Galveston, Texas Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:National Historic Landmarks in Texas ","title":"East End Historic District (Galveston, Texas)"},{"id":"18115959","text":"Stina Grenholm is a Swedish ski-orienteering competitor and world champion.

Early life  Born in Berkeley County, Virginia (later West Virginia) outside Martinsburg to Frederick Nadenbousch. His siblings included Susan E Seibert and Moses C. Nadenbousch.Mrs. Susan E. Seibert. The Baltimore Sun (Baltimore, Maryland) 8 Feb 1908, page 10, accessed at Newspapers.com In 1848, he married Hester Jane Miller. Early in life he had worked as a carpenter and proprietor of a Martinsburg lumber yard, and, by 1852, expanded his business affairs with the purchase of the Beeson flour mill, and soon established a distillery on the north side of Tuscarora Creek. The distillery he built in Martinsburg in 1857 was destroyed during the Civil War but was rebuilt in 1863 and became the Hannis Distilling Company.Martinsburg, W. VA, The Baltimore Sun (Baltimore, Maryland) 11 Jan 1901, page 9, accessed at Newspapers.com  Militia Service and Harper‚Äôs Ferry  Nadenbousch was instrumental in forming the Berkeley Border Guards, a pre-Civil War local militia unit. When John Brown attacked the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, on October 16, 1859, Nadenbousch‚Äôs company was one of the first to respond.  American Civil War  Following Virginia‚Äôs secession, Nadenbousch‚Äôs company was called into service and became Co. D, 2nd Virginia Infantry, which was part of the Stonewall Brigade under General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and first engaged at the First Battle of Manassas. Following the battle, Nadenbousch personally brought home the bodies of three of his men, and buried them in the Old Norbourne Cemetery, in Martinsburg. Later the commander of the regiment, Nadenbousch was twice wounded; first at the Second Manassas, in August, 1862, and, less than a year later, at the Battle of Chancellorsville, in May, 1863. On account of impaired health, and at his own request, Nadenbousch was relieved later that summer, from duty in the field, and assigned to the command of the post at Staunton, Virginia. He later resigned on April 12, 1864, and began his return to civilian affairs before the war concluded. In his obituary, Nadenbousch was noted for his courage, ability, and coolness; and said to be a favorite of General Jackson. On May 25, 1863, Nadenbousch purchased the American Hotel in Staunton, Virginia at an auction from Samuel B. Brown and Aaron S. Lara. When the Union Army under David Hunter occupied Staunton in June 1864, Nadenbousch befriended one of Hunter's officers, David Hunter Strother, who agreed to spare the American Hotel and its adjoining warehouse when the Army destroyed the nearby train depots. Nadenbousch's loyalty to the Confederacy may have shifted and when Hunter left Staunton on June 10, he gave Nadenbousch a pass to \\"return home as a loyal citizen of the United States.\\"Culbertson, Charles.

It opened in December 1877, but Nagenbousch only operated it for about one year before renting it out to J. N.

They were typically some of the youngest and poorest men in the legion, and could not afford much equipment. They were usually outfitted with just a number of light javelins and no other equipment. There were 300 leves in a legion, and unlike other infantry types they did not form their own units, but were assigned to units of hastati -- heavier sword-armed troops. Their primary purpose on the battlefield was to harass the enemy with javelin fire and support the heavy infantry who fought in hand-to-hand combat. Accensi and rorarii were also light missile troops and had similar roles. History and deployment Leves appear to have evolved from the old poor classes of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus ca. 386 BC. These soldiers stood at the rear of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to leves. They provided missile support to the richer hand-to-hand infantry in the front ranks, and also acted as a screening force. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used many smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. =Camillan system= By the 4th century BC the military the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans was still in use. Though its efficiency was doubtful, it proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome. The entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia in a crushing defeat that prompted reforms by Marcus Furius Camillus. Under the new system, men were sorted into classes based on wealth; the leves were some of the poorest, along with the rorarii and accensi. Leves typically carried a number of light javelins and a simple round shield about 90 cm (3 feet) in diameter. The larger rectangular Scutum was sometimes carried by those soldiers who could afford it. They fought in a loose formation, often forming up at the front of the army before battle to pepper the enemy with missiles. Under this organisation, the 300 leves were attached to units of hastati, heavy sword armed troops, rather than forming their own units. In a pitched battle, the leves would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati and other heavy infantry. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line. =Polybian system= The Camillan system of organisation proved inefficient, in part due to the relatively large number of light troops, and sometime in the mid-3rd century BC, was restructured. In a new system, described by Polybius, the different types of light troops were done away with and replaced by a single skirmisher class, the velites. Their equipment and role was very similar to that of the leves, to harass the enemy with missile fire and support friendly troops.

The Center for Liturgy offered a range of quality national and regional programs and conducted parish liturgical missions, training days and consultations. The Center is no longer in operation. History In 1981 Fr. Timothy Healy, S.J., then president of Georgetown University, and Fr. Al Panuska, S.J., the Provincial of the Maryland Province, recognized the need for specialized centers to assist the American Catholic Church with the implementation of the liturgical reforms initiated by the Second Vatican Council. This prompted Fathers Healy and Panuska to establish The Georgetown Center for Liturgy, Spirituality and the Arts (later known as The Georgetown Center for Liturgy), a unique joint project of Georgetown University and its neighbor, Holy Trinity Catholic Church. Being rooted in both a university and a parish assured that the Center‚Äôs work would be supported by the strength of the university‚Äôs resources and educational expertise and informed by the actual pastoral experiences of a parish. Fr. Lawrence J. Madden, S.J., who held a doctorate in liturgical studies from the University of Trier, Germany, was selected to head up the project. Father Madden had been Director of Campus Ministry and a member of the Theology Faculty at Georgetown University for the preceding ten years. Upon becoming Director of the new Center for Liturgy, Father Madden also became an associate pastor of Holy Trinity parish; later he served as pastor. His participation in the life of the parish helped to shape the overall mission of the Center as one concerned not only with the theoretical dimension of liturgy but also with congregational praxis. Under Madden‚Äôs direction, the Center for Liturgy became a nationally known and widely respected education, research, and consultation center whose primary focus was to ensure the quality of Roman Catholic worship in the United States. Madden was also on the governing board of the Catholic Coalition on Preaching. Paul F. X. Corvino served as associate director. Since the Second Vatican Council, remarkable strides have been made in the renewal of Catholic liturgy, including the use of the vernacular in the liturgy, the involvement of the laity, the greater role of Scripture in Catholic worship, and the composition of new music to enhance the celebration of the reformed rites.\\"The Georgetown Center for Liturgy: Working for a Transformed Church through a Renewed Liturgy\\", National Jesuit News On the other hand, the shortage of priests has led to the creation of larger and larger churches, which can house more people for fewer Masses. Madden noted, ‚ÄúIt takes a tremendous amount of skill for somebody to lead 1,200 people as opposed to 700 and the feel is very different to the assembly.‚Äù Madden devoted much of his priestly ministry to helping parishes celebrate the liturgy well.Fox, Mary G. \\"A Faithful Servant: Rev.

Programs The staff undertook research projects, published regularly in liturgical and pastoral journals, and offered courses at Georgetown University. Among the programs offers by the Center for Liturgy were: * \\"Leading from the Heart\\", a long distance learning program for presiders and preachers that integrated ritual studies, theology and spirituality, and developed performance capacity; the distance learning program included \\"coaches\\" to assist the learner in building practical competency in their role. * Study Tours Abroad: The Center conducted annual liturgical study tours led by GCL staff, which explored the intersection between liturgy, art, and architecture. Tour locations included Rome in 2007 and 2008, and Amsterdam and Brussels in 2008. * Conferences ** Northeast Liturgical Conference (2003) ** Liturgy-Justice Colloquium (2003) ** The Joseph Campbell Phenomenon (1991) ** Twenty-Five Years Since the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1988) ** Form/Reform (1986-2006) ** Talks and Retreats on liturgy, spirituality, and parish life. * Advent Celebration: Each December the Georgetown Center for Liturgy hosted an Advent Celebration which included a Eucharistic Celebration and Reception, and the presentation of an annual Award for Outstanding Contributions Made to the Liturgical Life of the American Church. EnVision Church EnVisionChurch was the Center‚Äôs interactive online resource for liturgy and spirituality.EnVisionChurch.org It offered articles on sacred art and architecture, seasonal worship environments, places of spirit, and liturgy. These articles, written by professionals in each field, provide insight and advice for those interested in the intersections between liturgy, theology, spirituality, sacred art and architecture. In addition to its information resources, EnVisionChurch was also a forum for learning, sharing, networking, and conversation among professionals who assist faith communities with building and/or renovating places of worship and with commissioning artwork; parish leaders, building/renovation committees, parishioners engaged in liturgical ministries (including art and environment committees), and facility/maintenance staff; and diocesan building/renovation and facilities commissions and offices.

It was one of the earliest successful algorithms developed for Cartographic generalization.  Idea  The purpose of the algorithm is, given a curve composed of line segments (which is also called a Polyline in some contexts), to find a similar curve with fewer points. The algorithm defines 'dissimilar' based on the maximum distance between the original curve and the simplified curve (i.e., the Hausdorff distance between the curves). The simplified curve consists of a subset of the points that defined the original curve.  Algorithm  Simplifying a piecewise linear curve with the Douglas‚ÄìPeucker algorithm. The starting curve is an ordered set of points or lines and the distance dimension Œµ > 0\\\\. The algorithm recursively divides the line. Initially it is given all the points between the first and last point. It automatically marks the first and last point to be kept. It then finds the point that is farthest from the line segment with the first and last points as end points; this point is obviously farthest on the curve from the approximating line segment between the end points. If the point is closer than Œµ to the line segment, then any points not currently marked to be kept can be discarded without the simplified curve being worse than Œµ. If the point farthest from the line segment is greater than Œµ from the approximation then that point must be kept. The algorithm recursively calls itself with the first point and the farthest point and then with the farthest point and the last point, which includes the farthest point being marked as kept. When the recursion is completed a new output curve can be generated consisting of all and only those points that have been marked as kept. The effect of varying epsilon in a parametric implementation of RDP = Non-parametric Ramer‚ÄìDouglas‚ÄìPeucker = The choice of Œµ is usually user-defined. Like most line fitting / polygonal approximation / dominant point detection methods, it can be made non-parametric by using the error bound due to digitization / quantization as a termination condition. = Pseudocode = (Assumes the input is a one-based array) function DouglasPeucker(PointList[], epsilon) // Find the point with the maximum distance dmax = 0 index = 0 end = length(PointList) for i = 2 to (end - 1) { d = perpendicularDistance(PointList[i], Line(PointList[1], PointList[end])) if (d > dmax) { index = i dmax = d } } ResultList[] = empty; // If max distance is greater than epsilon, recursively simplify if (dmax > epsilon) { // Recursive call recResults1[] = DouglasPeucker(PointList[1...index], epsilon) recResults2[] = DouglasPeucker(PointList[index...end], epsilon) // Build the result list ResultList[] = {recResults1[1...length(recResults1) - 1], recResults2[1...length(recResults2)]} } else { ResultList[] = {PointList[1], PointList[end]} } // Return the result return ResultList[] end Link: https://karthaus.nl/rdp/  Application  The algorithm is used for the processing of vector graphics and cartographic generalization. It does not always preserve the property of non-self-intersection for curves which has led to the development of variant algorithms. The algorithm is widely used in robotics to perform simplification and denoising of range data acquired by a rotating range scanner; in this field it is known as the split-and-merge algorithm and is attributed to Duda and Hart.  Complexity  The running time of this algorithm when run on a polyline consisting of n-1 segments and n vertices is given by the recurrence T(n)=T(i+1)+T(n-i) + O(n) where i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n-2\\\\\\\\} is the value of index in the pseudocode. In the worst case, i=1 or i=n-2 at each recursive invocation and this algorithm has a running time of \\\\Theta(n^2). In the best case i=\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor or i=\\\\lceil n/2\\\\rceil at each recursive invocation in which case the running time has the well-known solution (via the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences) of O(n\\\\log n). Using (fully- or semi-)Dynamic convex hull data structures, the simplification performed by the algorithm can be accomplished in O(n\\\\log n) time .

Biography Born Shauna McKenzie in Kingston, Jamaica, the only girl in a family of boys, Etana grew up in the eastern Saint Andrew community of August Town. Her vocal talent was discovered when she was eight years old and was overheard singing along to a 1991 hit by the group Air Supply. Etana migrated to the United States in 1992. She went on to attend Broward Community College with the intention of becoming a registered nurse. =Beginnings (2000‚Äì2005)= Following her decision to prematurely exit college in 2000, Etana joined a female vocal group named Gift. At the time Universal Records was interested in their music so Etana reluctantly agreed to wear the skimpy outfits dictated by the music industry's pervasive stereotyping of female artists; then one day, she could no longer conform. Etana returned to her Kingston birthplace and focused on making music that reflected her embracement of Rastafari principles, which include a royal representation of women, adhering to a natural lifestyle, and an acknowledgment of the teachings of Marcus Garvey and Emperor Haile Selassie I. That opportunity arrived in 2005 when a friend brought her to Kingston's Fifth Element Records, who were then enjoying success with Richie Spice's single \\"Earth A Run Red\\" and his album Spice in Your Life. Etana successfully auditioned to become one of Spice's vocalists on his tour of Europe and North America. =The Strong One (2007‚Äì2009)= While in the studio with the guitarist and percussionist from Spice's band, Etana put together the song \\"Wrong Address\\". Fusing acoustic folk with roots reggae rhythms and strains of neo-soul influences \\"Wrong Address\\" was based on the experience of Etana's aunt being told to lie about where she lived to gain employment. The single received heavy radio rotation, reaching the number one position on several Jamaican charts. Etana's second major hit \\"Roots\\" was inspired by her travels to Africa (her very first solo performance was in Ghana). The remainder of the songs on her debut album The Strong One, presents an eclectic mix of Etana's ideas and influences, which include Air Supply, Dolly Parton, Bob Marley and Sizzla.

The house was designed in 1904 by the architect Roman Meltzer, who was one of the interior designers of the Winter and Alexander Palaces in Saint Petersburg, and was built in 1906 at a cost of 212,000 roubles. After the October Revolution in 1917, Kamenny Island was renamed Workers' Island () and the dachas were used by decree of Vladimir Lenin as rest homes, sanitoriums and housing for the homeless. Follenweider's Mansion, also known to locals as the Gingerbread House or Fairytale House, was handed over to the Leningrad Administration of Trade Unions and was transformed into a sanatorium for the treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. In November 1992 the house was granted to the Royal Danish Government to house their consulate-general in Saint Petersburg.

The squadron saw action during the Second World War, the Suez Crisis and the Korean War. History =Pre war= 810 Squadron was assigned to the aircraft carrier in May 1933 and formed part of the Home Fleet. In September that year the Darts were replaced by Blackburn Ripons, and these were in turn replaced by Blackburn Baffins in July 1934, with the entire squadron operating Baffins by November that year. The Abyssinian crisis caused Courageous and the squadron to be transferred to the Mediterranean from August 1935 to February 1936. The squadron was upgraded to use Blackburn Sharks in April 1937, and then Fairey Swordfish in September 1938. 810 Squadron was then transferred to the new aircraft carrier the following month, and had embarked by January. The squadron was amongst those transferred to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939. =Second World War= By the outbreak of war the squadron was aboard Ark Royal, flying 12 Swordfish on anti-submarine patrols. They carried out an unsuccessful attack on on 14 September 1939, losing two of their aircraft to their own bombs. The squadron was involved in activities over Norway after the German invasion in April 1940, and carried out bombing raids on Vaernes aerodrome. They sailed with Ark Royal to Gibraltar, and carried out attacks during the British Attack on Mers-el-K√©bir in July. The squadron made an abortive attack on the , and later attacked the . The squadron was again in action in August and September, when they carried out bombing raids at Cagliari and Sardinia, and against the French fleet in the Battle of Dakar, when their aircraft made an unsuccessful attack on the . They then saw action in November at the Battle of Cape Spartivento, and the following year in February carried out bombing attacks on Tirso Dam, Sardinia and bombing attacks on Livorno and La Spezia in Italy. Ark Royal was ordered into the Atlantic in May 1941 to search for the , and the squadron was involved in the attack which crippled her, and led to her sinking. 810 Squadron then returned to the UK with Ark Royal, followed by a period in the Mediterranean to operate against enemy positions on Sardinia. They left Ark Royal in September, before her sinking in November, and saw service supporting convoy movements to Jamaica. The squadron was reassigned in March 1942 to for operations in the Indian Ocean. They were then involved in the Battle of Madagascar in May, bombing shipping and land targets at Diego Suarez. They were re-equipped with Fairey Barracuda IIs in April 1943, after which they returned to the Norwegian coast in July 1943. They then re-embarked aboard HMS Illustrious and operated in support of the Salerno landings. 810 Squadron was then re-grouped as part of the 21st Naval Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing in October 1943, and sailed in November to join the Eastern Fleet. They carried out attacks on docks and oil tanks at Sabang in Operation Cockpit in April 1944, and followed this in June with raids on the Andaman Islands. Illustrious then put in for a refit at Cape Town. By February 1945 the squadron was back in the UK at RNAS Stretton, where they were re-equipped with the improved Barracuda IIIs. They moved to the airbase at Thorney Island in March, and then to the East Coast, where they trialled the new ASV Mk.XI radar with RAF Coastal Command. The squadron then disbanded in August 1945. =Post war= Egyptian Air Force MIG fighters burn after an attack on Inchas airfield by Hawker Sea Hawks of 810 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm, operating from HMS Bulwark The squadron was re-formed twice previously at RNAS Lossimouth and went on to see action in the Suez Crisis and earlier during the Korean War flying Hawker Sea Furys. During Operation Musketeer, the squadron operated Hawker Sea Hawks from . The squadron was then disbanded. The squadron was reformed with Gannet AS4 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander A M Sinclair at RNAS Culdrose in May 1959 to embark in to replace the defective Whirlwind AS Helicopters of 824 Naval Air Squadron. It embarked from RAF North Front at Gibraltar only six weeks later after a record re-conversion to fixed wing flying for many of the pilots and observers. No Telegraphists Air were carried because of the short drafting notice. This also necessitated Centaur landing her 849 AEW Flight to provide room as a large Commonwealth exercise in waters off Ceylon was scheduled based around carrier based AS operations. The squadron remained with HMS Centaur throughout the remainder of that Commission, visiting the Persian Gulf - the first Aircraft Carrier to test conditions in the height of summer with cockpit and flight deck temperatures often approaching 160F, before sailing for the Far East including Japan and later Australia. The ship returned to Home Waters in April 1960 and the Squadron was disbanded on board in the North Sea three months later, returning its aircraft to RNAS Abbotsinch - from whence they had hastily been retrieved from the mud 15 months previously. It was the last fixed wing AS Squadron embarked in the Royal Navy, although several aircraft went on to serve with 831 Squadron embarked and ashore and with COD flights. XG 797 is preserved at the Imperial War Museum at RAF Duxford. It commissioned again on 3 March 1983 at RNAS Culdrose, flying ten Sea King HAS.5, with which they took on part of the role of 737 Naval Air Squadron. They had some responsibility for advanced flying training tasks, but some of these were transferred to 706 Naval Air Squadron in October 1985. The squadron was deployed at times on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships and . The squadron was re-equipped with the Sea King HAS.6 in October 1989, with the last HAS.5s being retired in February 1990. 810 absorbed E Flt of 826 Naval Air Squadron in July 1993, when 826 Squadron was disbanded. 810 Squadron was decommissioned in July 2001, with its main role passing to 814 Naval Air Squadron, and its Search and Rescue element passing to 771 Naval Air Squadron.

David Clarence McClelland (May 20, 1917 - March 27, 1998) was an American psychologist, noted for his work on motivation Need Theory. He published a number of works between the 1950s and the 1990s and developed new scoring systems for the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and its descendants.Biography - David C. McClelland retrieved June 24, 2008 McClelland is credited with developing Achievement Motivation Theory, commonly referred to as \\"need for achievement\\" or n-achievement theory.Hoy, K. H., & Miskel, G. M. (2008). Structure in Schools. In E. Barrosse, D. Patterson, & J. Eccher (Eds.), Educational Administration: Theory, Research, and Practice (pp. 135-174). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. A Review of General Psychology survey published in 2002, ranked McClelland as the 15th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Life and career McClelland, born in Mt. Vernon, New York, was awarded a Bachelor of Arts from Wesleyan University in 1938, an MA from the University of Missouri in 1939, and a PhD in experimental psychology from Yale University in 1941. He taught at Connecticut College and Wesleyan University before joining the faculty at Harvard University in 1956, where he worked for 30 years, serving as chairman of the Department of Psychology and Social Relations. In 1987, he moved to Boston University, where he was awarded the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions. The major themes of David McClelland's work were on personality and the application of that knowledge to helping people make their lives better. One theme was the development of the expectancy-value theory of human motivation. A second theme was the development of tests and operant methods, such as the Thematic Apperception Test, Behavioral Event Interview, and the Test of Thematic Analysis. A third theme was the development of job-competency studies, and a fourth theme was the application of this research to helping people and their social systems, whether that was through motivation and competency development, organization and community development, and changing behavior to battle stress and addiction. David McClelland believed in applying the results from the research and testing to see if they helped people. He was instrumental in starting 14 research and consulting companies, the largest was McBer and Company (1965-1989), which later was sold to Yankelovich, Skelly & White. =Expectancy Value Theory of Motivation= McClelland claimed that motivation is ‚Äúa recurrent concern for a goal state or condition as measured in fantasy, which drives, directs and selects the behavior of the individual‚Äù.McClelland, D.C. (1987). Human motivation. New York: University of Cambridge. Basing his work on the work of Henry Murray, he focused on three particular motives: the need for achievement (N-Ach); the need for affiliation (N-Aff); and the need for power (N-Pow). N-Ach is the desire to excel in relation to a set of standards. It is the drive to succeed. N-Pow is the desire to be influential and affect an organization. N-Aff is the desire for close personal relationships. McClelland's three needs, are non-sequential, but instead are used in relation to each other. > ‚ÄúAccording to his theory, most people possess and portray a mixture of these > needs: those with a high need for achievement have an attraction to > situations offering personal accountability; individuals with a dominating > need for authority and power have a desire to influence and to increase > personal status and prestige; and finally, those with a great need for > affiliation value building strong relationships and belonging to groups or > organizations.‚Äù The work in the 1940s through the late 1960s focused on the Achievement Motive and its impact on development of economies and entrepreneurship.Miron, D., & McClelland, D.C. (1979). The effect of achievement motivation training on small business. California Management Review, 21, 13‚Äì28. doi=10.2307/41164830 He shifted his work in the 1960s to focus on the power motive, first addressing issues of addiction and alcoholism (McClelland, Davis, Kalin and Wanner, 1972), then to leadership effectiveness,McClelland, D.C., & Boyatzis, R.E. (1982). The leadership motive pattern and long-term success in management. Journal of Applied Psychology, 67, 737‚Äì743. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.737McClelland, D.C., & Burnham, D.H. (1976). Power is the great motivator. Harvard Business Review, 54, 159‚Äì166. and later to community development.McClelland, D.C., Rhinesmith, S., & Kristensen, R. (1975). The effects of power training on community action agencies. Journal of Applied Behavioral Sciences, 11, 92‚Äì15. doi:10.1177/002188637501100108 The work on leadership and management helped to create a behavioral level of a person's capability, which McClelland called ‚Äúcompetencies.'McClelland, D.C. (1973). Testing for competence rather than intelligence. American Psychologist, 28, 1‚Äì14. doi=10.1037/h0034092McClelland, D.C. (1998). Identifying competencies with behavioral event interviews. Psychological Science, 9, 331‚Äì339. doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00065 He also led efforts to show how important competencies were relative to knowledge and traditional personality traits in the desired outcomes of higher education (Winter, McClelland and Stewart, 1981). His work on power extended into research on the body's natural healing process.McClelland, D.C. (1979). Inhibited power motivation and high blood pressure in men. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 88, 182‚Äì190. doi=10.1037/0021-843x.88.2.182 In an exception from the typical focus of a psychologist, McClelland also examined cultural and country-wide effects of motives and related them to large-scale trends in society, such as economic development, job creation, the provocation of wars and health. McClelland's work on motivation was cited as the most useful approach to motivation in a study by the former accounting firm Touche Ross & Company (Miller, 1981). =In Search of Operant Tests and Measures= David McClelland argued that operant methods (i.e., tests where a person must generate thoughts or actions) were much more valid predictors of behavioral outcomes, job performance, life satisfaction and other similar outcomes. Specifically, he claimed that operant methods had greater validity and sensitivity than respondent measures (i.e., tests calling for a true/false, rating or ranking response). He fought against more traditional psychologists insisting on using self-assessment, respondent measures and avoiding operant measures because, in traditional views, operant measures suffered from less traditional measures of reliability. McClelland believed that better operant measures were possible with the use of reliable codes for processing the information in them.Winter, D.G., & McClelland, D.C. (1978). Thematic analysis: An empirically derived measure of the effects of liberal arts education. Journal of Educational Psychology, 70, 8‚Äì16. doi:10.1037/0022-0663.70.1.8 He claimed his lifelong quest was to instill in psychological researchers a value of extracting people's actual thought (i.e., conscious and unconscious) along with their behavior. He was repeatedly publishing research and encouraging his doctoral students and colleagues to show that operant methods, as compared to respondent methods, consistently show: (a) more criterion validity; (b) increased insightfulness despite less test-retest reliability; (c) greater sensitivity in discriminating mood and such differences; (d) more uniqueness and less likelihood of suffering from multicollinearity; (e) greater cross-cultural validity, because they did not require a person to respond to prepared items; and (f) increased utility in applications to human or organizational development. =Job Competencies= McClelland and colleagues conceptualized a broad array of capabilities.McClelland, D.C., Baldwin, A.L., Bronfenbrenner, & Strodbeck, F.L. (1958). Talent and society. New York: Van Nostrand. Reviving his 1951 personality theory,McClelland, D.C. (1951). Personality. New York: William Sloane Associates. McClelland and his colleagues at McBer and Company intensified competency research on management, leadership and professional jobs in the early 1970s (i.e., skills, self-image, traits, and motives, see Boyatzis, 1982; Spencer and Spencer, 1993; Goleman, 1998). The definition of a job competency required that the person's intent is understood, not merely that the person's behavior is observed. They used operant methods like audiotaped Critical Incident Interviews, which they called Behavioral event Interviews and videotaped simulations with inductive research designs comparing effective with ineffective or even less effective performers. This approach was focused on the ‚Äúperson,‚Äù rather than the tasks or job. The research results developed a picture of how a superior performer in a job thinks, feels, and acts in his/her work setting. This became a model for how to help anyone in a job, or aspiring to one, develop their capability. It became, over the coming decades, the norm for training design, selection and promotion practices, career development and even higher education in developing people for such jobs. =Helping People Change= David McClelland believed that if you know how an outstanding performer thinks and acts, you could teach people how to think and act that way. The early projects addressed entrepreneurial development and training in achievement thinking and behavior for small business owners in India, Tunisia, Iran, Poland, Malawi and the US. ‚ÄúUnderstanding human motivation ought to be a good thing. It should help us to find out what we really want so that we can avoid chasing rainbows that are not for us. It should open up opportunities for self-development if we apply motivational principles to pursuing our goals in life‚Äù. Publications * McClelland, D.C. (1951). Personality.

The Fathers repeatedly condemned the magical use of numbers which had descended from Babylonian sources to the Pythagoreans and Gnostics of their times. They denounced any system of philosophy which rested upon an exclusively numerical basis. Even so, they almost unanimously regarded the numbers of Holy Writ as full of mystical meaning, and they considered the interpretation of these mystical meanings as an important branch of exegesis. There was reluctance in the Christian teachers of the early centuries to push this recognition of the significance of numbers to extremes. Irenaeus IrenaeusHaer., V, xxx. explains the number of the beast 666 (Apoc., xiii, 18) by adding the numerical value of each \\"Greek letter\\" in the word \\"Lateinos.\\" The constituent of all the Greek letters yields the total: :\\"L\\" being 30 + \\"a\\" being 1 + \\"t\\" being 300 + \\"e\\" being 5 + \\"i\\" being 10 + \\"n\\" being 50 + \\"o\\" being 70 + \\"s\\" being 200 = 666. \\"Latin\\" is the official language of Rome, which specifically is also that of the Roman Catholic Church. Irenaeus also discusses at lengthHaer., I, viii, 5 and 12, and II, xxxiv, 4. the Gnostic numerical interpretation of the holy name \\"Jesus\\" as the equivalent of 888, and he claims that by writing the name in Hebrew characters an entirely different interpretation is necessitated. Ambrose St. Ambrose commenting upon the days of creation and the Sabbath remarks, :\\"The number seven is good, but we do not explain it after the doctrine of Pythagoras and the other philosophers, but rather according to the manifestation and division of the grace of the Spirit; for the prophet Isaias has enumerated the principal gifts of the Holy Spirit as seven\\" (Letter to Horontianus). Augustine Augustine of Hippo, replying to Tichonius the Donatist, observes that :\\"if Tichonius had said that these mystical rules open out some of the hidden recesses of the law, instead of saying that they reveal all the mysteries of the law, he would have spoken truth\\".De Doctrina Christiana, III, xlii. Influence of Biblical texts Influenced mainly by Biblical precepts, the Fathers down to the time of Bede and even later gave much attention to the sacredness and mystical significance not only of certain numerals in themselves but also of the numerical totals given by the constituent letters with which words were written. An example is in the early Epistle of Barnabas. This document appeals to The Book of GenesisGen., xiv, 14 and xvii, 23. as mystically pointing to the name and self-oblation of the coming Messias. \\"Learn, therefore,\\" says the writer, \\"that Abraham who first appointed circumcision, looked forward in spirit unto Jesus when he circumcised, having received the ordinances of three letters. For the Scripture saith, And Abraham circumcised of his household eighteen males and three hundred.' What then was the knowledge given unto him? Understand ye that He saith the eighteen' first, and then after an interval three hundred.' In the [number] eighteen [the Greek IOTA] stands for 10, [the Greek ETA] for eight. Here thou hast Jesus ([in Greek] IESOUS). And because the cross in the [Greek TAU] was to have grace, he saith also three hundred.' So he revealeth Jesus in two letters and in the remaining one the cross\\".Ep. Barnabas, ix. Here the numerical value of the Greek letters iota and eta, the first letters of the Holy Name, is 10 and 8, for 18, while Tau, which stands for the form of the cross, represents 300.

It is also a rare example of a top municipal football ground which has, for most of its history, not been used for cricket during the summer months; in the early 1920s, the council determined that it preferred to leave the ground as a public space during summer and to not compromise the surface by installing cricket pitches; since that time, Jubilee Park has been the district's primary cricket venue. In 2008, the St Kilda Football Club had planned to move its primary training base from Moorabbin Oval to Frankston Park and to re-develop it into a top class training venue for the club; but these plans fell through due to high cost, and the club instead developed and moved to Belverdere Park in nearby Seaford.

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), was a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States involving antitrust law and civil procedure. Authored by Justice David Souter, it established that parallel conduct, absent evidence of agreement, is insufficient to sustain an antitrust action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. It also heightened the pleading requirement for federal civil cases by requiring for plaintiffs to include enough facts in their complaint to make it plausible, not merely possible or conceivable, that they will be able to prove facts to support their claims. The latter change in the law has been met with a great deal of controversy in legal circles, as evidenced by the dissenting opinion from Justice John Paul Stevens. (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Background  William Twombly and Lawrence Marcus brought a class-action lawsuit alleging that Bell Atlantic and a number of other large telecommunications companies had engaged in anti- competitive behavior in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the companies had acted to disadvantage smaller telephone companies and charge consumers more by, for example, refraining from entering markets where another large company was dominant (thereby preventing a price war), even though the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had made it relatively inexpensive to do so.\\"Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly\\", The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. Their complaint was dismissed by Judge Gerard E. Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, as failing to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for a violation of the Sherman Act. The decision was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 2006.  Decision  The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Second Circuit, which had reversed the decision of the district court (Lynch D.J.) dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As an initial matter, the Supreme Court clarified the requirements of proving a claim of anti-competitive behavior under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The Sherman Act prohibits entering into a \\"contract, combination, or conspiracy\\" to restrain trade. The court held that while parallel conduct (actions by competing companies that might be seen as implying some agreement to work together) is \\"admissible circumstantial evidence\\" from which an agreement to engage in anti-competitive behavior may be inferred, parallel conduct alone is insufficient to prove a Sherman Act claim. The court then upheld the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint, holding that the mere allegations contained in the complaint that the competitors had agreed not to compete were insufficient to state a claim of conspiracy under the Sherman Act. The court found that Twombly's complaint had not provided enough facts for the court to find it plausible that the companies had engaged in a conspiracy; instead, the complaint provided factual bases for parallel conduct, not enough under the court's new interpretation of the Sherman Act, and stated only that an agreement had taken place, with no details to support that allegation. The court held that the dismissal of the complaint was therefore proper. The decision changed the existing interpretation of the notice pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) and the standards for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) by creating a new, stricter standard of a pleading's required specificity. Previously, under the standard the court set forth in Conley v. Gibson, a complaint needed to state only a \\"conceivable\\" set of facts to support its legal claims. In other words, a court could not dismiss claims unless it appeared, beyond a reasonable doubt, that plaintiffs would be able to prove no set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief. In Twombly, the court adopted a stricter \\"plausibility\\" standard that required \\"enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.\\" The general applicability of this heightened standard of pleading outside of antitrust cases was established in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, when the court also provided guidance as to how lower courts should apply the Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly test: The two cases are often jointly referred to as Twiqbal. The case was argued successfully by Michael K. Kellogg of law firm Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel and Thomas O. Barnett, Assistant Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, on behalf of the United States as amicus curiae for the petitioners.  Legislative reaction  On July 22, 2009, after the Supreme Court broadened Twombly with its decision in Iqbal, Senator Arlen Specter introduced the Notice Pleading Restoration Act of 2009, which provided:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-1504 > Except as otherwise expressly provided by an Act of Congress or by an > amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which takes effect after > the date of enactment of this Act, a Federal court shall not dismiss a > complaint under rule 12(b)(6) or (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil > Procedure, except under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court of the > United States in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957).4 Shortly thereafter, a similar bill was introduced in the US House of Representatives. It was called the \\"Open Access to Courts Act of 2009:\\" > A court shall not dismiss a complaint under subdivision (b)(6), (c) or (e) > of Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unless it appears beyond > doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim > which would entitle the plaintiff to relief. A court shall not dismiss a > complaint under one of those subdivisions on the basis of a determination by > the judge that the factual contents of the complaint do not show the > plaintiff's claim to be plausible or are insufficient to warrant a > reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct > alleged.

It is also a nationally known shopping and cultural district known for its many eclectic small retailers, restaurants, music and art venues and, more recently, food trucks. South Congress begins at the Colorado River and Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and runs due south towards Ben White Boulevard/TX-71. The area bordered by two historic South Austin neighborhoods: Travis Heights to the east and Bouldin Creek to the west. Since its humble beginnings in the 1850s, South Congress Avenue has been transformed from a rural country road to the capital city gateway and, finally, to the shopping district that it is today. Some Austinites attribute its enduring popularity to the unobstructed view of the Texas State Capitol. History Edwin Waller designed Congress to be Austin's most prominent thoroughfare in the 1830s. However, Congress did not extend south of the Colorado River until 1852 when James Gibson Swisher donated land for a road that was both the postal route to Austin and the main highway to San Antonio. Growth along South Congress slowed during the 19th century; it was not until the completion of a concrete bridge in 1910 that South Austin had reliable transportation over the river. Rapid growth finally came to South Austin in the 1920s, as the streetcar was expended down South Congress. As hundreds of bungalows were built in South Austin, more commercial enterprises began appearing south of the river - especially on South Congress. By 1931, South Congress was finally paved all the way from the river to the railroad at present-day Ben White Boulevard. Many of South Congress's icons opened their doors between 1930 and 1960. The Austin Motel opened in 1938 and the Hotel San Jos√© shortly thereafter. The hamburger stand that would eventually become the legendary Night Hawk opened on South Congress in 1932. Another major development was the Twin Oaks Shopping Center at the northeast corner of Oltorf Road and South Congress. It was one of Austin's first \\"strip\\" shopping venues when it opened in 1954. South Austin opened further during the 1950s, as the Congress Avenue Bridge was widened and the construction of Interstate 35 provided an alternative north-south route. During the 1970s, South Congress became a mecca for artists, musicians and their supporters. The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters opened at the corner of South Congress and Barton Springs Boulevard in 1970. Tourist traffic declined on South Congress with the rise of I-35 and many businesses fell into disrepair. By the late 1980s, small eclectic retailers began popping up along the South Congress Corridor, attracted by cheap rent. The area's renaissance began at the intersection of South Congress and Monroe by putting their historic buildings to good use to attract eclectic retail business, arts and music venues and restaurants to the area. South Austin's first skyscrapers appeared at South Congress and Riverside Drive when two new hotels opened. 1988 was a watershed moment for the area, as Kent Cole and Diana Prechter fixed a beat-up wood-frame building that had operated as Flossie's bar and the Austex Lounge, and reopened it as Magnolia Cafe South. Said they were attracted by the \\"colorful people\\" and cheap rent. Memories of drug dealers and prostitutes began to fade in the 1990s. Austin, a relatively small city for most of its history, suddenly enjoyed a tremendous economic boom that attracted new residents and drove an increased demand for older housing stock in the Travis Heights and Bouldin Creek neighborhoods. That in turn spurred massive renovation along South Congress and throughout old South Austin. The 1990s witnessed the redevelopment of the Austin Theatre, the H-E-B at Oltorf and South Congress and more. Perhaps the most ambitious renovation undertaken was the redevelopment of Penn Field from an industrial plant to a multi-use complex that includes office space, retail and residences. By the end of the decade, South Congress was well on its way to becoming a nationally known shopping and cultural district. Economy The shopping district contains numerous shops, restaurants, and music venues. There is a square featuring a number of food trucks serving tacos, falafel, cupcakes, and more. Notable retailers on South Congress include Allens Boots (1977), Lucy in Disguise with Diamonds (1984), Uncommon Objects (1992-2017) and Friends of Sound (1996-2016). Restaurants in the area include Guero's Taco Bar (1995), where Texas Radio Live is broadcast on Sun Radio every Wednesday evening, Home Slice Pizza (2005), South Congress Cafe (2003) and Hey Cupcake (2007). First Thursday is a community event held each month where business stay open to 10 p.m. or later to celebrate the neighborhood‚Äôs boutiques, restaurants and galleries. The event is held on the first Thursday of every month between Barton Springs Road and Elizabeth Street.

He ruled Tmutarakan under the overall authority of his father Sviatoslav Iaroslavich, Prince of Chernigov. He was twice expelled from his principality by one of his cousins Rostislav Vladimirovich. His father appointed him prince of Novgorod in 1067 or 1068. He suppressed a rebellion incited by a sorcerer against the bishop of the town. Later he was expelled from Novgorod, and was killed by the Chudes. The Russian Primary Chronicle writes that he \\"was kindly toward the poor and hospitable to strangers, zealous toward the church, warm in faith, peaceful, and fair in appearance\\".Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6586), p. 165. Early life Gleb was the eldest of the fours sons of Sviatoslav Iaroslavich, Prince of Chernigov by his first wife, Killikiya. According to historian Martin Dimnik, Gleb was born around 1049. He was named after his father's holy uncle, Gleb. His father appointed him to rule Tmutarakan, an important port by the Strait of Kerch, but the year of his appointment is unknown. Prince of Tmutarakan According to the Russian Primary Chronicle, Gleb's cousin Rostislav Vladimirovich \\"fled to Tmutorakan\\"Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6572), p. 144. in 1064. He expelled Gleb from Tmutorakan and \\"occupied his principate for himself\\". Although Gleb was restored by his father in 1065, once Sviatoslav Iaroslavich had returned with his army to Chernigov, Rostislav invaded again and displaced Gleb from power once more. However, the Byzantine katepano or governor of Cherson poisoned Rostislav who died on 3 February 1067. According to the Life of Feodosy, the citizens of Tmutorakan requested the monk Nikon the Great to persuade Sviatoslav Iaroslavich to again appoint Gleb as their prince. The saintly monk succeeded and Gleb returned to Tmutarakan. According to the inscription of the \\"Stone of Tmutarakan\\", Gleb had the width of the frozen Strait of Kerch measured in the winter of 1067-68. Prince of Novgorod Principalities in the Kievan Rus' (1054-1132) Gleb was transferredaccording to historian Martin Dimnik, by his fatherfrom Tmutarakan to Novgorod in 1067 or 1068. A distant relative of his, Vseslav Briacheslavich lay siege to Novgorod \\"on October 23, the day of the Lord's brother, St James, a Friday, at the sixth hour of the day\\",The Chronicle of Novgorod (year AD 1068 AM 6576), p. 5. according to the Chronicle of Novgorod. However, Gleb and the Novgorodians routed him on the brook Gzen near the town. Gleb's rule in Novgorod was confirmed when his father became the Grand Prince of Kiev in 1073. According to the Hypatian version of the Russian Primary Chronicle, Gleb visited his father in Kiev and witnessed the death of the saintly Abbot Feodosy of the Monastery of the Caves in 1074. He seems to have been on friendly terms with his cousin, Vladimir Monomach whose first son was born in his court at Novgorod. A late sourceVasily Tatishchev's compilation of medieval chronicleswrites that Sviatoslav Iaroslavich appointed Gleb and Vladimir Monomach to command the Rus' troops sent to fight against the Bulgarians at Cherson upon the request of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Ducas, but the source's reliability is doubtful. Radziwill Chronicle The Russian Primary Source narrates that a \\"magician\\"Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6579), p. 154. arrived in Novgorod and stirred up the townsfolk against the bishop. The magician planned to murder the prelate but Gleb and his druzhina or retinue remained loyal to him. Gleb dared the sorcerer who had stated that he could foretell the future to predict \\"what was about to happen that very day\\", according to the Russian Primary Chronicle. The magician declared that he would \\"perform gre\`at miracles\\", but Gleb pull out an axe from his cloth and killed him. After the magician's death, his followers broke up. Gleb's father died on 27 December 1076. According to Novgorodian sources, the citizens of the town rose in revolt and dethroned Gleb in 1078. He fled beyond the lands beyond the river Volkhov, known as Zavoloch'e, where the Chudes killed him on 30 May. His body was transferred to Chernigov where he was buried in the Holy Savior Cathedral on 23 July. No source makes mention of Roman's marriage or his children, suggesting that he never married and died childless.

Hardwick's photographs have been the subject of several one-man shows and he produced fourteen 16 mm films. He taught the study of Josef Albers color theory at Jacksonville University. In 1959, Hardwick opened Jacksonville's first modern furniture showroom, The Atrium, and in 1962, he co-founded the Group Gallery, the first Contemporary art exhibition space in Jacksonville. Personal life and education Born in 1925 and raised in suburban Philadelphia, Taylor was third of four children of Marjorie and Gordon Hardwick, an insurance executive. Taylor graduated from The Asheville School in 1943. Taylor then attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, where he received a bachelor's degree and Masters of Architecture in 1947. After finishing his education, he married Louise Russell. The couple had two children: Marjory Wells, born in 1953; and Taylor Junior, born in 1954. The couple divorced in 1977 and he married Gay Leslie Mackendrick in 1979. They were married until her death in 2006. In 2008 he married Jo Holland Alexander, who survives him. His son, Taylor Hardwick, Jr. died in 2004. Career Hardwick moved to Jacksonville in 1949 and spent three years working at the firm W. Kenyon Drake & Associates before opening his own architectural design practice. In 1952 he partnered with fellow architect W. Mayberry Lee to form the firm Hardwick & Lee Architects. In late 1968 the partnership was dissolved and Taylor reverted to solo practice until his retirement in 2001. W. Mayberry Lee died in 1971. During his 50-year career, Hardwick designed more than 150 custom houses, five high schools, five elementary schools and a classroom building at the University of Florida. He created dozens of commercial buildings, including the Fletcher Building in Riverside, now known as the Physicians Insurance Company. The variety of styles present in the work of Hardwick and Lee can often make it difficult to classify. In recent years the label Mid-Century modern has been applied to the work of Hardwick & Lee and many of their prominent contemporaries. Hardwick & Lee used a variety of construction methods and visual motifs. Hardwick stated that he and his partner were always interested in innovating and consequently worked hard to avoid repeating themselves. Their work in the 1950s, primarily small residences and commercial buildings, made use of roofs pitched at very subtle angles and brick and timber wall elements arranged into patterns and grids (two residences in particular own a debt to the paintings of Piet Mondrian). Their work from the late 1950s through the 1960s includes color as an essential element. Often in this period roofs tend to dip and zigzag. In 1965 the firm completed their two largest and most important public commissions: Friendship Park and Fountain and the Haydon Burns Library. Strong lines and vaulting angles still occurred in Hardwick's solo work in the 1970s and 1980s. More subdued color and natural wood surfaces replace the vibrant colors of the previous decade. During this period Hardwick developed design solutions for conquering the more challenging aspects Florida terrain (swamps, rivers, abundant rainfall) with several structures built on stilts and others that were designed to float. Major projects = Haydon Burns Library= Haydon Burns Library in Jacksonville, ca. 1968 When built in 1965 at a cost of $3.7 million, the Haydon Burns Library was considered state of the art. The 3-story building was designed by Hardwick. Hardwick and the building committee for the library‚Äôs trustees toured six new and significant libraries throughout the country, intending to incorporate the best ideas in library design and operation into Jacksonville‚Äôs new facility. John Hall Jacobs, a nationally known library consultant, also contributed to the design process. Mr. Hardwick worked on the library building's design over a span of five years, and his comprehensive plan specified all interior furnishings, graphics and the use of innovative, free-standing book shelves. He chose cheerful colors and limited the use of natural light. The only elements Hardwick did not specify were the mosaic tile murals, which were designed by Ann Williams. The building served Jacksonville well, but by the mid-1990s, it was simply too small for the number of patrons using it. The Haydon Burns Library closed on September 3, 2005 and after moving to the newly constructed facility, bids were accepted for the old Burns Library building. The transfer of the building from the city to a private owner turned out to be a lengthy process. The eventual developer, Main Branch, LLC met with Hardwick and he was pleased that the exterior would remain mostly unchanged. Jacksonville Financial News & Daily Record: Sep 15, 2006-Meet Main Branch, LLC =Friendship Fountain and Park= The original Friendship Fountain and Park Friendship Fountain on the Southbank Riverwalk is one of Jacksonville, Floridas most recognizable and popular attractions. Begun in 1963 and opened in March 1965, the fountain was billed as the \\"World's Tallest and Largest\\" and became a popular tourist attraction. The entire park and fountain were built for $1,750,000 on land that was donated by a group of Southside businessmen. At the time, the streams of water could be seen from virtually any location downtown and nearby Southside. The three pumps had a combined and could push 17,000 gallons per minute; some streams were as tall as a 10-story building. The enclosure for the pumps and controls was so large that Hardwick incorporated it as a feature rather than a visual annoyance. The fountain functioned for over 20 years before the pumps were refurbished in December 1985, and then performed another 15 years. Finally, wear and corrosion forced its closure at the end of the century. A five-month, $1,300,000 rehabilitation began when the fountain was drained in March 2001. New features were added and the fountain was a major attraction at Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005. Two months later, two of the three original 40-year- old pumps failed and parts were no longer available. The replacement cost for the pumps was estimated at $400,000, and the city budget was tight and money was not available. The fountain at night with one pump The fountain has been running on one pump since then with a greatly reduced flow. The future of the Jacksonville landmark was unsure. A number of proposals were made, including moving Kids Kampus from Metropolitan Park and eliminating the fountain, rebuilding a smaller fountain, or renovating the existing fountain. In 2011 the city decided to put their efforts into restoring Jacksonville's historic landmark and hired local commercial fountain manufacturer, Delta Fountains, to renovate the fountain. The year-long project added new features and a new light and water show. German manufacturer Hansgrohe, a producer of high-end plumbing fixtures, featured Friendship Fountain (and architect Taylor Hardwick) in a series of print advertisements to focus worldwide attention on the need to preserve and maintain this work of art.website celebrating Taylor Hardwick's architecture =Skinner dairy= Hardwick designed the retail sales building for Skinner Dairy products in 1958, which were the forerunners of today's convenience stores. Skinner's Milk Houses were thoughtfully designed and visually interesting structures that eventually became an iconic presence throughout the greater Jacksonville area. Under their pitched \\"butterfly\\" roofs each identical store was painted orange and white, incorporated a drive-through feature that could be approached from two sides, and made use of aluminum sliding glass doors which were cutting edge at the time. The dairy was sold to the Suzia Foods Corporation in January 1996. As of December 2007, 16 of the original 21 buildings still exist in one form or another, most with their distinctive roofs intact. As a testament to the enduring appeal of the structures and their form, they have proven adaptable for a variety of independent businesses. A survey of current tenants include several drive-thru restaurants and sandwich shops, car wash and detailing services, check cashing, a florist, a dry-cleaner, a coffee shop, golf instruction, and pickup-truck bed-liners. Some successful adaptations require building additions which only on rare occasions are the structures aesthetics thoughtfully considered. five are presently in such a state that could be described as being original or close to it. Exhibitions Hardwick and his contributions to architecture in Florida were celebrated in the exhibition \\"Taylor Hardwick: 50 Years of Design\\" at the University of North Florida from June 26 ‚Äì July 25, 2003. Two lectures accompanied the exhibition.University of Pennsylvania School of Design: alumni news An architectural conference was held on February 2, 2008 at the Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens entitled, Mid-Century Modern: Exploring Mid-Century Modern Architecture in Florida. The program looked back at the work of architects that included Robert Broward, Hardwick, George Fisher and William Morgan in Jacksonville from 1946 to 1973. The University of North Florida produced a 53-minute film about Hardwick and his career. It was screened at the Art @ 3 program at the Cultural Center in Ponte Vedra Beach on February 7, 2008.Beaches Leader: February 7, 2008-Jacksonville architect speaks Later life Hardwick retired in 2001, and worked on his memoirs at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach. He spent time lobbying for the preservation of buildings he designed that are in danger of demolition; many of his creations have been torn down or revised. His Friendship Fountain Park, unveiled on the Jacksonville riverfront in 1965, was reduced to less than half its size when a city-owned restaurant and parking lot were built in 1985. He was unsuccessful in efforts to save the 1661 Riverside Avenue Medical Building, which was torn down to build condos in 2004. Before the demolition began, Midland Development set up a day of tribute to Hardwick's designs. On September 27, 2014, he died of cancer at the age of 89.http://jacksonville.com/breaking-news/2014-09-27/story/influential- jacksonville-architect-taylor-hardwick-dies-89 Honors Hardwick and his firm were the recipients of several awards including the House and Home Award of Merit in 1956, the Florida AIA Design Honor Award in 1964, and the H.J.

History Prior to 2010, the Junior Kiwis consisted of the best New Zealand players aged 18 years or younger and would represent the country against the likes of the Australian Schoolboys, the New South Wales Under 18 side and the England Under 18 side, sometimes as curtain raisers to the senior Kiwi games. Players such as Adam Blair, Thomas Leuluai, Issac Luke, Simon Mannering, Jerome Ropati, Manu Vatuvei and Sonny Bill Williams represented the Junior Kiwis early in their careers and went on to play at the senior level for New Zealand.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/junior-kiwis-win- chase-20071014-gdrc6d.htmlhttps://leagueunlimited.com/news/junior-kiwis- prepare-for-2006-campaign/ In 2010, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the Junior Kiwis was switched to an under 20s team and played in a two Test series against the Junior Kangaroos.http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/4161258/Junior-Kiwis-train-on- squad-named From 2011 to 2018, the Junior Kiwis faced the Junior Kangaroos at the end of each season in a one off Test match, usually as a curtain raiser to a senior level Australia-New Zealand Test match. In 2019, the side faced the Australian Schooolboys. The side reverted to an under-19 side for the fixture. 2010 series =1st Test= Played as a curtain raiser to the New Zealand- England Four Nations match. =2nd Test= Played as a curtain raiser to the New Zealand-Papua New Guinea Four Nations match. 2011 match Played as a curtain raiser to the Australia-New Zealand pre-Four Nations tournament match.

It has a traditionally shaped, single cut mahogany body, thinner than most Les Paul models, with two tone controls, two volume controls and the three position Rhythm/Treble switch. It also sports a stopbar tailpiece and Tune-o-matic bridge, like the higher end models. The main difference with the Les Pauls is the guitar's mahogany bolt-on neck, as opposed to the set-in neck normally found on Les Pauls and other Gibson guitars. The fingerboard also sports dot inlays instead of the Les Paul's Trapezoid inlays. The LP-100 currently comes with open coil 700T & 650R Ceramic humbucker pickups. There have been several variations of the LP-100 model, Including the LP-100 Studio, Standard (Japan), Studio-Standard (flame-top) and Deluxe (gold hardware). Les Paul 300 Also in this range of instruments was the LP-300.1991 Epiphone Catalog The LP-300 and LP-300 Standard ran alongside of the LP-100 and began production at the same time. The LP-300 was a slightly upscale version of the LP-100. The main differences between the LP-100 and LP-300 were the body woods and fingerboard inlays. The LP-300 had a laminated maple body and block inlays. The LP-300 Standard also had a laminated maple body, but trapezoid inlays.

They are categorised into positive and negative storms, where positive storms have a high density of electrons and negative storms contain a lower density. This is measured in total electron content (TEC), and is a key variable used in data to record and compare the intensities of ionospheric storms. Ionospheric storms are caused by geomagnetic storms. Its occurrences are strongly linked with sudden increases of solar wind speed, where solar wind brings energised electrons into the upper atmosphere of the Earth and contributes to increased TEC. Larger storms form global visibility of auroras. Auroras are most commonly seen in the arctic circle, however large ionospheric storms allow for them to be visible in places such as the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. The most intense ionospheric storm occurred in 1859, commonly named ‚Äúsolar storm of 1859‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCarrington Event.‚Äù The Carrington Event was named after Richard Carrington, an English astronomer who observed the irregular sun activity that occurred during the Carrington Event. The intensity of the storm brought the visibility of the aurora even closer to the equator, reported to be seen in places near it such as Florida and the Caribbean. Ionospheric storms can happen at any time and location. 257x257px F-region and D-region ionospheric storms are also considered main categories of ionospheric storms. The F-region storms occur due to sudden increases of energised electrons instilled into Earth's ionosphere. It is the highest region of the ionosphere, along with the F1 layer and F2 layer, its distance above the earth's surface being approximately 200‚Äì500 km above the Earth's surface. The duration of these storms are around a day and reoccur every approximately 27.3 days. Most ionospheric abnormalities occur in the F2 and E layers of the ionosphere. D-region storms occur immediately after F-region storms, and are referred to as the ‚ÄúPost-Storm Effect,\\" the duration of it spanning for a week after the F-region storm's occurrence. Historical Occurrences The largest ionospheric storm occurred during the Carrington event on August 28, 1859 and caused extensive damages to various parts including the sparking of fires in railway signals and telegraph wires. The substantial density of energised electrons produced by the storm caused these electrical overloads and shortages. Occurrences of storms in the last 35 years have been consolidated and measured in maximum Ap which records the average daily geomagnetic activity during ionospheric storms. There are higher levels of geomagnetic activity with high maximum Ap counts. Ap counts in terms of geomagnetic activity from 0-7 are considered \\"quiet,\\" 8-15 \\"unsettled,\\" 16-29 \\"active,\\" 30-49 \\"minor storm,\\" 50-99 \\"major storm,\\" and above 100 classified as a \\"severe storm.\\" Minor storms in the last 35 years ranging from 30-49 Ap occurred on 13 September 1999 (46), 11 October 2008 (34), 11 March 2011 (37), 9 October 2012 (46) and on 19 February 2014 (43). Major storms ranging from 50-99 Ap occurred on 6 April 2000 (82), 7 April 2000 (74), 11 April 2001 (85), 18 April 2002 (63), 20 April 2002 (70), 22 January 2004 (64), 18 January 2005 (84), 5 April 2010 (55), 9 March 2012 (87), 15 July 2012 (78) and on 1 June 2013 (58). Severe storms equalling or exceeding 100 Ap occurred on 8 February 1986 (202), 9 February 1986 (100), 13 March 1989 (246), 14 March 1989 (158), 17 November 1989 (109), 10 April 1990 (124), 7 April 1995 (100), 31 March 2001 (192), 6 November 2001 (142), 18 August 2003 (108), 29 October 2003 (204), 30 October 2003 (191), 20 November 2003 (150), 27 July 2004 (186), 8 November 2004 (140) and on 10 November 2004 (161). In recent accounts, the St Patrick's day storm in March 2013 and 2015 caused a strong negative phase in the F2 ionospheric region. The March 2013 and 2015 storms were also long lasting, spanning for over 6 hours. The June 2015 Southern Hemisphere winter storm had a shorter duration, lasting between 4 and 6 hours, and producing a positive effect in the ionosphere. It is difficult to determine the exact location and time for the occurrences of ionospheric storms, its effects being dependent on season, their varying starting points, compositional changes in the ionosphere and the travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) in relation to gravity waves having varying impacts on different locations. Phases of Ionospheric Storms In the commencement of an ionospheric storm, due to geomagnetic disturbances in the ionosphere, the storm will become positive for a brief duration. Then, it will become a negative phase storm, and revert to a recovery phase where electron density neutralises. =Positive Phase= The positive phase of an ionospheric storm will last for around the first 24 hours. In this phase, electron density in the ionosphere, particularly in higher altitude layers such as F1 and F2 will increase. Ionisation in the positive phase will be less apparent due to the increase of electron density. Positive phase ionospheric storms have a longer duration and are more prevalent in winter. = Negative Phase = The negative phase of an ionospheric storm will occur directly after the storm's positive phase and last one to two days after the positive phase decreases in electron density to \\"below its quiet time reference level.\\" Negative phases decrease the electron density of the storm. They also span for longer durations and appear more often during summer. =Recovery Phase= The recovery phase of the ionospheric storm occurs after the negative phase ends, and neutralises the electron density. A time scale of 12 hours to 1 day can be used in accordance with the Thermosphere Ionosphere General Circulation Model (TIGCM) as a means of calculating the precise time of electron density restabilising post-storm. Effects on Ionospheric Layers The effects of ionospheric storms on different layers in the ionosphere including in the F-region, E-region and D-region vary depending on the magnitude of the storm. F-Region is the most affected layer due to it ranging the highest altitude compared to the E-region and D-region. The D-region is the region with the lowest altitude and will receive the least geomagnetic disturbance. =F-Region= The F-region is the highest layer of the ionosphere and inner atmosphere, around 200 km above Earth's surface and spanning around 300 km in total layer altitude.The F2-region of the F-region (highest altitude inner atmospheric layer) will be affected through the decrease of critical frequency and maximum usable frequency, which is necessary for high frequency radio communication. The F-region is affected by the friction of solar wind on the ionospheric boundaries which causes magnetospheric motion that may infiltrate into the ionosphere or exit it, creating disturbances which increase and decrease TEC and electron density. During ionospheric storms, it is more common for \\"anomalous\\" increases and decreases of TEC and electron density to occur in the F2-layer. Ionisation density is also affected in the F-region, decreasing as the height increases, and as ionisation density increases, atoms lose electrons and therefore lower altitudes lose electron density. The lower layers of the F-region such as the F1-layer have higher amounts of ionisation and less electron density. =E-Region= The E-region is the middle layer of the ionosphere, approximately 100 km above the Earth's surface, spanning around 100 km up. Effects on the E-region are mainly associated with the high latitudes of the layer, where more severe geomagnetic disturbances occur. Ionisation in this layer is predominantly derived from the particle precipitation in auroras. Due to its lower latitude, there is greater ionisation density compared to that of the F-region, and less electron density. Increased conductivity of currents is caused by the convection electric fields of the magnetosphere that run down the lines of the magnetic field in the E-region. The increased conductivity is also from the effects of the ionospheric storm. There is also a maximisation in the E-region of the transfer of energy from plasma to neutral particles which promotes \\"frictional heating\\" and is used as a heat source for the thermosphere. =D-Region= The D-region is the lowest layer of the ionosphere, approximately 60 km above the Earth's surface and its layer's altitude spanning around 30‚Äì40 km. The top of the D-region is around 90‚Äì100 km above the Earth's surface. When ionospheric storms occur, there is enhanced ionisation of electrons that happens in the D-region and causes a decline in day-night asymmetry (DLPT depth.) DLPT depth is calculated by subtracting average day rate by average night rate and dividing it by the average of the rates. The DLPT depth decreases as Ap increases in the D-layer. Impacts = Radio Communications = There are strong disturbances to radio communications in the event of an ionospheric storm, where in middle and high altitudes, radio communications are considered ‚Äúineffective.‚Äù This is due to radio waves being found in the ionosphere where the sudden increase of solar wind and energised electrons will interfere. The impacts of disturbances related to radio communications can include temporary blackouts of signal to radio-wave based technology such as televisions, radios and cordless phones. Global impacts vary, including the detriment of digital broadcasting and the displaying of information through radio-communication technologies which may temporarily eliminate the use of certain technologies. = Aircraft and Electrical Systems = Aircraft passengers and the crew are more prone to dangerous exposure from radiation during an ionospheric storm. Flight altitudes are usually 10 km or more, so when an ionospheric storm occurs during the flight, people on the plane will potentially gain an approximate 0.1% chance of developing a lethal cancer during their lifetime. The plane when flying at a 10 km or above altitude will have around 300 times more exposure to ionised radiation than on sea level. The energised particles produced by the ionospheric storm will also potentially cause damage and disrupt \\"microelectronic circuitry\\" due to single event effect (SEE), when the energised particles interconnect with the semiconductor device and causes system failure. Aircrew and the pilot in this situation during short circuiting of aircraft electrical equipment will be reprioritised of their work and cause detriment to the overall safety and wellbeing of the passengers. =Satellites= Ionospheric storms have a visible effect on satellites and satellite communication. Solar cells on satellites will have a chance of being affected or destroyed and this will lead to disturbances in satellite communications and signals commonly used for various technologies. This disturbance can hinder the sending of signals such as in the form of broadcasting and data communications. =Climate= Earthward solar winds and excessive radiation produced from it has limited effect on the climate. The radiation emitted by solar wind only reaches the highest layers of the Earth's atmosphere, including the ionosphere. In the lower atmospheres, where climate change is able to be recorded and monitored, there are minimal trends supporting an ionospheric storm's impact. It is recorded that the increase of solar wind during March 2012 in the United States ‚Äúcoincided‚Äù with the heat waves that occurred at the time. The impact on climate in accordance with ionospheric storms based on modern technology is shown to have little to no impact. =GPS and GNSS systems = Due to the disturbances of signals in the ionosphere caused by ionospheric storms, GPS systems are drastically affected. In the late 20th and 21st centuries GPS signals are incorporated within various phones, so the commonality of its use has majorly increased since its release. It is a significant piece of technology that is almost entirely affected as it serves the purpose of displaying direction, which can disable people from being able to tell directions. Directional equipment in aircraft like Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS) is also used, however is compromised by radiation damage on satellites and solar cells which all for this navigation system to work. When aircraft loses access to GNSS in the event of an ionospheric storm, back up aircraft procedures are available. Storm Detection Technology During the Carrington Event in 1859 where there were only a limited number of available measuring technologies, the full extent of the impacts could not be precisely recorded apart from recounts in newspaper articles written in 1859. In the late 20th and early 21st century, forecasting technology has been improved. This technology allows meteorologists to detect the highest frequency that can be vertically returned 24 hours in advance with accuracy of 8-13% periods with limited disturbance.

Institution The medal was instituted in 1979 in memory of Professor Donald Reid who was Director of the Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine from 1961 until his sudden death in 1977. The medal was created by the distinguished medal sculptor Louis Osman. The School Council of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Royal College of Physicians of London propose names for the medal and the eventual recipient of the medal is then nominated by a Committee composed of the Dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, two members nominated by the School Council, two members nominated by the president of the Royal College of Physicians (not being members of the staff of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) and one member nominated by the Faculty of Public Health Medicine.London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Regulations for the Donald Reid Medal The missing award Although the award is officially given every three years, there has been a period in which this regularity was not observed. After Jeremiah Stamler received the medal in 1988, it was not then awarded for five years until 1993 (to Richard Peto), and then not for a further four years until 1997 (Brian MacMahon). Thus, in this 9-year period when three awards should have been made, only two were. In 1991, when the award was not made at all, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was undergoing a period of restructuring following the appointment of Professor Richard Feachem as the Dean (the former Dean, Professor Gordon Smith having retired in 1989). The award made in 1993 was either two years late, or one year early because no 1994 award was made either. However, the 1997 award was made in accordance with the three-year cycle and re-established the regularity of the award.

Controversial in its time, The Voice of the Turtle explores the sexual struggles of Sally Middleton, a young woman attempting to reconcile her childhood teachings on the importance of chastity with her newfound affection for Bill Page. The play derives its name from a verse in the Song of Solomon in the Bible, which reads \\"The voice of the turtle [as in turtle dove] is heard in our land.\\" (2:10‚Äì13) On December 8, 1943, the show opened at the Morosco Theatre and ran for 1,557 performances, making it the 51st longest- running show and the 9th longest-running play in Broadway history. In 1947, the stage play was adapted into a film of the same name starring Ronald Reagan, Eleanor Parker, Eve Arden, and Wayne Morris. Plot synopsis The story begins on a Friday afternoon in early April as aspiring actress Sally Middleton has just finished moving into her new apartment in the East Sixties. Even though she has just left her home in Joplin, Missouri, for life in the big city, the married Broadway producer she has been seeing is quick to dump her when he begins to feel she is ruining their relationship by falling in love with him. Heartbroken, Sally confides her uncertainties in her friend Olive Lashbrooke, a promiscuous, worldly girl, questioning the practicality of the lessons in chastity she received as a child and wondering if she is alone in her passion, or if other women share these sensations. Unbeknownst to Sally, Olive has a date planned with Bill Page, a Sergeant in the United States Army who happens to be on leave for the weekend, and she has arranged for him to meet her at Sally's new apartment. At the last minute, however, Olive is asked on a date by another man, and she decides to stand up Bill for what she considers to be the better offer. Bill, still bitter over a love affair gone wrong from five years past, finds himself yet again hurt by love, and to make matters worse he has no hotel reservation, nor is there a nearby friend with whom he can stay. Devoid of any alternative, the two strangers find themselves bound together in Sally's apartment for the weekend, where they are forced to confront their fears of fidelity and their ever-growing interest in one another. Productions =Original Broadway production= The Voice of the Turtle debuted on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on December 8, 1943, where the show ran until October 13, 1947, when it briefly transferred to the Martin Beck Theatre. On November 25, 1947, the play transferred once more to the Hudson Theatre, where it ran until its closing on January 3, 1948. Altogether, The Voice of the Turtle ran for 1,557 performances, making it the fourth longest-running Broadway play at that time. Written and staged by John William Van Druten, the show was produced by Alfred De Liagre, Jr., with Alexander Haas in charge of conducting and music arrangement. The opening night cast included Margaret Sullavan as Sally Middleton, Elliott Nugent as Bill Page, and Audrey Christie as Olive Lashbrooke. =Off-Off Broadway= A revival of The Voice of the Turtle opened off-off-Broadway at the Blue Heron Arts Center in 2001 under the direction of Carl Forsman. Elizabeth Bunch was cast as Sally Middleton, with Nick Toren and Megan Byrne portraying the characters of Bill Page and Olive Lashbrooke, respectively.  Critical reception  Reviews of the original production praised it as \\"the most delightful comedy of the season\\" (New York Times) and \\"a romantic comedy that is at once witty, tender, and wise\\" (New York Herald Tribune).Schildcrout, p. 66. Many critics highlighted the novelty of a play with only three actors, as well as Stewart Chaney's functional set.Schildcrout, p. 67-68.

He had held the seat since the 1929 general election, with a four-year gap after his defeat in the National landslide at the 1931 general election. He was re-elected at the 1935 election.  Candidates  The Labour Party selected as its candidate Francis Douglas, a former solicitor. In keeping with a war-time electoral pact, the Conservative and Liberal parties did not field candidates, and Douglas's only opponent was E.C. Joyce, who stood as an anti-war Independent candidate. Joyce received the backing of the Communist Party.  Results  On a considerably reduced turnout, Douglas held the seat for Labour with a majority of 9,156 votes; Joyce won just 7.4% of the votes cast, thus forfeiting his deposit. Douglas would go on to hold the seat against Conservative opposition at the 1945 general election, until resigning in 1946 to take up the post of Governor of Malta, precipitating another by-election in the constituency.

In Somalia, it involves four players, usually using a 144-card pack made up 4 identical 36-card packs. Game play The game uses a standard French deck of playing cards. One deck is used for 2-4 players (52 cards), 2 decks are used for 5-7 players (104 cards) and 3 decks are used for 8-12 players (156 cards). Each player is dealt four cards and a four-card community pile is also dealt. The general purpose of turup is to collect the highest number of cards from the community pile that add or equal a card from a players individual hands. After a deal the first person to the left of the dealer begins the play. The dealer also rotates to the left after each round. There are two ways to collect the cards from the community pile; a match or addition. Face cards cannot be won with addition and can only be won as a match. Only one card from the players hand can be played at a time and after a play is made play moves to the next player. Aces are valued as a one (1). =Match= In turn, each player compares their hand to the community pile. If a card in their hand matches one of the cards in the community pile the player can collect the card and place both the card from their hand and the card from the community in a separate pile of cards won, the suit of the card does not come into play. Match example: A players owns a six (6) and there is a six (6) in the community pile, the player can collect the six (6) and match it to the six (6) from their hand. Only one card from the players hand can be played at a time and after a play is made play moves to the next player. =Addition= In turn, each player compares their hand to the community pile. If a card in the players hand equals the addition of two or more cards then the player can collect all the cards from the community pile that add to the players card and place all the cards in their separate pile of cards won, again the suit of the cards do not come into play. Addition example: A player owns a ten (10) and there is a four (4) and a six (6) in the community pile. The player can collect the four (4) and the six (6) from the community and add it to equal the ten (10) from their hand. =Addition and Match= In turn, each player compares their hand to the community pile. If a card in the players hand equals the addition of two or more cards AND matches a card all cards equaling the players card can be won by the player. Add and Match example: A player owns a queen, a ten (10) and a five (5) and the community pile contains a three (3), two (2), king and five (5). The player can combine the two (2) and three (3) to equal the players five (5) match the five (5) in the community pile with the players five (5) for a total of four cards won. =No Match or Addition= If the player cannot make an equal from the community pile then the player must place a card from their hand into the community pile and play moves to the next player. If there are no cards in the community pile the next player in turn must place a card down in the community pile. A player does not have to make a match or addition even if the player owns a match or addition, this is explained in the Strategy section below. =Winning= After all four cards have been played from each of the hands of the players another four cards are dealt from the remaining deck of cards. Once the remaining deck of cards have all been dealt each player counts the cards from their individual separate pile of cards won. The player with the highest number of cards wins the round. Any cards left in the community pile are not counted towards any players cards won. The number of rounds can be preset or tallied for posterior acknowledgement. Strategies =Massive Addition= There are several strategies that can be used in the game of turup. This will list a few of the basic strategies involved when trying to create an equal with a players hand. The value of ten is the easiest card to equal through addition. The value of ten has the most combinations of cards to total. If the community pile included an ace, two (2), three (3) and a four (4) the total of the four cards would equal ten (10). A player with a 10 could collect all 4 cards in the community pile and their own ten (10) for a total of 5 cards won. =Delayed Match= A player can also use strategy to set up for an addition by placing cards from their deck with a lower value to use on their next turn. This strategy runs the risk of another player using that card for a match or addition. Delayed Match example: Let's say the community pile included a king, three (3), six (6) and Jack and the player holds a five (5) and an eight (8). The player can place their five (5) into the community pile with hopes of using the three (3) and the five (5) to add to their last remaining card which is an eight (8), but again this runs the risk that the other player(s) will use either the three (3) or five (5) for a match of their own. =Doubled Match= A third an even more riskier play is after a player makes a match the player can choose to leave the match in the community pile with the hopes of making the same match on the players next turn. This is generally only done when a multiple card is owned by a player, in other words 2 kings in hand. Doubled Match example: If the community pile consists of a king, three (3) and eight (8) and the players hand contains a king, another king and a two (2). The player would create a match with the king and leaves the king in the community pile with the hopes on matching the other king on the next turn. This runs the risk of another player having a king in hand and collecting the previous match of kings on their turn, taking away the cards won from the first player.

(born 4 June 1940) is the Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Linz, Austria. Life Ludwig Schwarz was the first of nine children and grew up in Most pri Bratislave. After the expulsion of his family from Slovakia in 1945, he arrived in Vienna, where he attended primary school. He attended a Gymnasium in Vienna for a time, but switched to the Salesian school in Ebreichsdorf-Unterwaltersdorf at the age of fourteen. In June 1959, he sat for the Matura exams and subsequently joined the order of the Salesians of Don Bosco. He was assigned a two-year teaching practicum; for the first year he served as a general assistant in Ebreichsdorf, and the second at the Sch√ºlerheim Vinzentinum in Klagenfurt. He studied philosophy in Ebreichsdorf and Catholic theology in Klagenfurt; from 1961 to 1964 he studied at Benediktbeuern Theological College (Philosophisch-Theologischen Hochschule Benediktbeuern). On 29 June 1964, he was ordained to the priesthood by the Bishop of Augsburg, Josef Stimpfle. He afterwards served briefly as assistant chaplain at a parish church in Graz. He then studied classical philology and archeology at the University of Vienna, and was also the hospital chaplain at Sacred Heart Hospital (Herz Jesu Krankenhaus Wien). He received his doctorate in 1970. From 1969 to 1978, he was rector of an inter-diocesan seminary, Canisiusheim Centrum Horn. Until 1984, he was superior of the Austrian province of the Salesians, situated in Vienna. In 1984 he was appointed to a directorship at the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. Starting in 1985, he taught Christian classical philology at the university. In 1993, he assumed the responsibilities of provincial for the Roman Province of the Salesians of Don Bosco. From February 1999 to February 2005, he was National Director of Pontifical Mission Societies in Austria (popularly known as Missio). On 15 October 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed him an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Vienna with the titular see of Simidicca. Schwarz received episcopal ordination on 25 November 2001 by Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. In that capacity, he directed Vienna's Diocesan Office for Mission and Development. =As bishop of Linz= Schwarz was appointed the Diocesan Bishop of Linz on 6 July 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI; he assumed that office on 18 September. Schwarz put an end to some of the liberal practices of his predecessor, Maximilian Aichern. Unlike his predecessor, Schwarz is typically unwilling to grant exemptions from ecclesiastical norms. He has enforced Catholic teaching that prohibits baptisms and preaching by lay people, and has been more stringent about norms for the reception of the Eucharist. Schwarz has also had to deal with some controversy over the nomination of Gerhard Maria Wagner as auxiliary bishop of the diocese, whose selection by the Congregation for Bishops was rejected by many of the liberal deans in Austria. Wagner turned down the appointment as a result.

The troupe was founded in 1993 by current Director Dameon Willich. The troupe consists of performers from the Puget Sound area. Many of the Seattle Knights are professional actors who perform in local theaters around the Northwest, while others perform as a hobby or secondary to another career. Members are trained in a combat system that emphasizes safety and authenticity, as well as entertainment value. They have the best safety record in the industry. Television and film performances The Seattle Knights and their members have worked in motion pictures, television, commercials, and radio. Members provided medieval combat stuntwork on the History Channel's 2001 series, \\"Modern Marvels: Battle Gear\\". Members of Seattle Knights performed equestrian stuntwork in the 1997 film The Postman, and the independent film Warrior's End. Live Shows The Seattle Knights are actor-combatants, who perform choreographed, medieval-style combat using real armor and weapons. They regularly perform in renaissance fairs in across the United States, and in annual benefit shows at Bridle Trails State Park. The troupe also participates in parades, state and county fairs, and other local events. Male and Female Seattle Knights cross swords Combat is performed by both men and women, utilizing a variety of weapons, including: spears, war hammers, axes, daggers, and swords of almost every variety. Combatants include knights, mercenaries, rogues, damsels in distress, magic wielders, elves, and a variety of monsters, depending on the needs of the story. In the shows, equestrian wargames test the speed, courage, and horsemanship of the mounted Knights. Jousters contest in armor drawn from many different cultures and periods on a variety of breeds of horses. Warriors awaiting their turn join the audience in heckling, making wagers, and cheering on their favorites. The more typical shows feature story lines created by Dameon Willich and Darragh Metzger, centering on the fictional land of T√≠r na n√ìg. As the story goes, this land is entered by crossing the enchanted mists into a world existing parallel to this one. Faerie folk and humans share this world, however, not always peacefully. The ruling body in this land is referred to as the Greater Fey, who wield powers that help keep their citizens lawful. Conflicts are abated quickly by the Greater Fey and their human Triads. A Triad is created by the Greater Fey which choose humans who have proven themselves to be strong, brave and clever. They consist of Cavaliers, the warrior-knights, Rangers, light fighters, and Mystics, wielders of magic. Each Triad is connected to a Faction, designated by a color. This storyline culminates in a tournament, where each Faction may prove its skill through combat, light horse runs, and the joust. Other performances Seattle Knights as Pirates of the Puget Sound Members of the Seattle Knights perform in two additional shows separate from their traditional medieval performances. They perform in a pirate themed show as the \\"Pirates of Puget Sound\\". The troupe also performs as the \\"Seattle Swashbucklers\\" in shows featuring a 1600-1650s theme. The fantasy-oriented folk music of \\"A Little Knight Music\\" has garnered favorable reviews across the northwest. Training Members of the troupe meet weekly to practice and engage in mock battles. When not performing in shows, the Knights gather on weekends at private ranches in Marysville, Renton, and Hobart to practice their equestrian skills and foot combat on outdoor terrain. Members of the troupe also lead classes, available to the public, for the training of student combatants.

Poisson is a professor at the University of Guelph as well as an affiliate member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Education He was born in Montreal, Quebec, and grew up in Rimouski and Quebec City. He obtained his bachelor of science degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and his Ph.D. at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton. He received his doctorate in 1991 under the supervision of Werner Israel. Research Poisson's doctoral dissertation was on the concept of mass inflation (not to be confused with cosmological inflation), which he pioneered with Israel. Prior to the understanding of mass inflation, it was believed that wormholes into other universes would be found inside some black holes. Mass inflation closes off these wormholes in realistic black holes. After completing his doctorate, Poisson spent three years as a postdoctoral fellow in Kip Thorne's research group at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena. During this period, he became interested in the gravitational-wave signatures that black hole systems might produce. Such signatures are crucial for the operation of gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO. This work continued for a subsequent year spent with Clifford Will at Washington University in St. Louis. His research now focuses on gravitational self-force, which is the force on a body moving through a gravitational field arising from the mass and energy of the body itself. This self-force is expected to play a crucial role in understanding the motion of a stellar mass black hole orbiting and eventually spiraling into a supermassive black hole such as those that reside at the centers of galaxies. These astronomical systems will be of special interest to space-based gravitational wave detectors such as Laser Interferometer Space Antennae when they are built, because they will allow precision measurements of the gravitational field of a black hole for the first time.

Steckel has published over a hundred of her short stories, poems and nonfiction pieces in print and in online publications such as Scholastic Magazine, Yale Medicine, Red Rock Review, So to Speak, Redwood Coast Review, and Bellevue Literary Review. Beyond the prodigious numbers of awards she has received, her work has been widely reprinted and anthologized. Steckel's writing has been nominated twice for Pushcart Prizes: once for her nonfiction, and once for her poetry. A bilingual background (Steckel is fluent in Spanish as well as English), extensive medical training, and work in underserved communities allow Steckel to tackle subjects that other writers (particularly those from more conventional middle-class backgrounds) aren't always able to cover adequately, and her work in different media (poetry, short stories, creative nonfiction) facilitates a great deal of creative cross-pollination. Her poetry chapbook The Underwater Hospital is available from Zeitgeist Press. She is currently working on a book-length collection of interrelated short stories and on a collection of short humorous first-person essays. Most of the stories and essays have already appeared in print. She is also a founding member of Woman-Stirred, a queer women's writing collective, along with Nicki Hastie, Julie R. Enszer, and Merry Gangemi. Education and medical career Steckel's undergraduate work was at Harvard-Radcliffe University, where she earned her B.A. in English literature with an emphasis on creative writing in 1983. Later she studied Golden Age Spanish Literature at Oxford University on a Henry Fellowship through 1984. In 1989 she took a few premedical courses while conducting research in the neuroscience laboratory. Steckel attended Yale University School of Medicine, where she picked up her M.D. in May 1994. Steckel's speciality was in pediatrics, in which she completed her residency at Children's Hospital Boston in July 1997. Board-Certified in Pediatrics by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1997, Steckel obtained her Physician and Surgeon License from the Medical Board of California in 1997; she became a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2000. Steckel served for a time in the Peace Corps as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic; upon her return to the States, she cared for Spanish- speaking families in California at a county hospital and at a large HMO. After she left medicine permanently in 2001, her experiences as a pediatrician continued to inform her work. Personal life Steckel grew up in Santa Monica, where she attended Lincoln Junior High School (now Lincoln Middle School), studying journalism. She went to Santa Monica High School. Steckel, openly bisexual, lives in Northern California with her husband Hew Wolff, who has collaborated on some of her poetry.

The politicians elected in 1970 formed the provisional parliament of the new state. The Mukti Bahini and other militias amalgamated to form a new Bangladeshi army to which Indian forces transferred control on 17 March. The government faced serious challenges, which including the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state's economy had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation. He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh's security forces and government personnel. Mujib forged a close friendship with Indira Gandhi, strongly praising India's decision to intercede, and professed admiration and friendship for India. Major efforts were launched to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million refugees. The economy began recovering and a famine was prevented. A constitution was proclaimed in 1972 and elections were held, which resulted in Mujib and his party gaining power with an absolute majority. He further outlined state programmes to expand primary education, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country. A five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture, rural infrastructure and cottage industries. In 1974, Bangladesh experienced the deadliest famine ever, which killed around 1.5 million Bangladeshi people from hunger. The Bangladesh famine of 1974 is a major source of discontent against Mujib's government. Bangladeshi people feel ashamed, insulted and demoralised as a nation for this famine that was not due to a food crisis. =Left wing insurgency= At the height of Sheikh Mujib's power, left wing insurgents, organised by Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal's armed wing Gonobahini fought against the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to establish a Marxist government. The government responded by forming the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini which began a campaign of brutal human rights abuses against the general populace, including the force became involved in numerous charges of human rights abuse including political killings, shooting by death squads, and rape. Members of Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini were granted immunity from prosecution and other legal proceedings. =Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL)= According to Abdur Razzaq, the 1974 famine profoundly affected Mujib's views on governance, while political unrest gave rise to increasing violence. During the famine, 70,000 people were reported as dead (Note: Reports vary). In response, he began increasing his powers. On 25 January 1975 Mujib declared a state of emergency and his political supporters approved a constitutional amendment banning all opposition political parties. Mujib assumed the presidency and was given extraordinary powers. His political supporters amalgamated to form the only legalised political party, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League, commonly known by its initials‚ÄîBAKSAL. The party identified itself with the rural masses, farmers and labourers and took control of government machinery. It also launched major socialist programmes. Using government forces and a militia of supporters called the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, Mujib clamped down on any opposition to him. The militia known as RakhiBahini and police were accused of torturing suspects and political killings. While retaining support from many segments of the population, Mujib evoked anger amongst veterans of the liberation war for what was seen as a betrayal of the causes of democracy and civil rights. =Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and aftermath= On 15 August 1975, a group of junior army officers invaded the presidential residence with tanks and killed Mujib, his family and personal staff. Only his daughters Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Sheikh Rehana, who were visiting West Germany, escaped. They were banned from returning to Bangladesh. The coup was planned by disgruntled Awami League colleagues and military officers, which included Mujib's colleague and former confidant√© Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who became his immediate successor. There was intense speculation in the media accusing the US Central Intelligence Agency of having instigated the plot. Lawrence Lifschultz has alleged that the CIA was involved in the coup and assassination, basing his assumption on the then US ambassador in Dhaka Eugene Booster. Mujib's death plunged the nation into many years of political turmoil. The coup leaders were soon overthrown and a series of counter-coups and political assassinations paralysed the country. Order was largely restored after a coup in 1977 gave control to the army chief Ziaur Rahman. Declaring himself President in 1978, Ziaur Rahman signed the Indemnity Ordinance, giving immunity from prosecution to the men who plottedZiaur Rahman informed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman earlier about coup threat Mujib's assassination and overthrow. =The dictatorship of Ziaur Rahman, 1975‚Äì81= Successive military coups resulted in the emergence of Army Chief of Staff General Ziaur Rahman (\\"Zia\\") as strongman. He pledged the army's support to the civilian government headed by President Chief Justice Sayem. Acting at Zia's behest, Sayem dissolved Parliament, promising fresh elections in 1977, and instituted martial law. Acting behind the scenes of the Martial Law Administration (MLA), Zia sought to invigorate government policy and administration. While continuing the ban on political parties, he sought to revitalise the demoralised bureaucracy, to begin new economic development programs, and to emphasise family planning. In November 1976, Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and assumed the presidency upon Sayem's retirement five months later, promising national elections in 1978. As President, Zia announced a 19-point program of economic reform and began dismantling the MLA. Keeping his promise to hold elections, Zia won a five- year term in June 1978 elections, with 76% of the vote. In November 1978, his government removed the remaining restrictions on political party activities in time for parliamentary elections in February 1979. These elections, which were contested by more than 30 parties, marked the culmination of Zia's transformation of Bangladesh's Government from the MLA to a democratically elected, constitutional one. The AL and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), founded by Zia, emerged as the two major parties. In May 1981, Zia was assassinated in Chittagong by dissident elements of the military. The attempted coup never spread beyond that city, and the major conspirators were either taken into custody or killed. In accordance with the constitution, Vice-President Justice Abdul Sattar was sworn in as acting president. He declared a new national emergency and called for election of a new president within six months‚Äîan election Sattar won as the BNP's candidate. President Sattar sought to follow the policies of his predecessor and retained essentially the same cabinet, but the army stepped in once again. 1980s =The dictatorship of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, 1982‚Äì90= Presidential Oath Ceremony after 1986 election, with the Chief Justice and Military Secretary (1984‚Äì1989) Brigadier ABM Elias Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup on 24 March 1982, citing the \\"grave political, economic, and societal crisis\\" that the nation was in. This move was not unanticipated, as Ershad had previously expressed distaste with the ageing Sattar (who was past his 75th birthday) and his handling of national affairs, in addition to his refusal to allow the army more participation in politics. Like his predecessors, Ershad suspended the constitution and‚Äîciting pervasive corruption, ineffectual government, and economic mismanagement‚Äîdeclared martial law. Among his first actions were to privatise the largely state-owned economy (up to 70% of industry was in public ownership) and encourage private investment in heavy industries along with light manufacturing, raw materials, and newspapers. Foreign companies were invited to invest in Bangladeshi industry as well, and stiff protectionist measures were put in place to safeguard manufacturing. All political parties and trade unions were banned for the time being, with the death penalty to be administered for corruption and political agitation. Ershad's takeover was generally viewed as a positive development, as Bangladesh was in a state of serious economic difficulty. Two weeks before the coup in March, Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman announced that the country was facing significant food shortages. The government also faced a severe budget deficit to the tune of 4 billion takas, and the IMF declared that it would not provide any more loans until Bangladesh paid down some of its existing debts. The following year, Ershad assumed the presidency, retaining his positions as army chief and CMLA. During most of 1984, Ershad sought the opposition parties' participation in local elections under martial law. The opposition's refusal to participate, however, forced Ershad to abandon these plans. Ershad sought public support for his regime in a national referendum on his leadership in March 1985. He won overwhelmingly, although turnout was small. Two months later, Ershad held elections for local council chairmen. Pro-government candidates won a majority of the posts, setting in motion the President's ambitious decentralisation program. Political life was further liberalised in early 1986, and additional political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the Jatiya (National) Party, designed as Ershad's political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Despite a boycott by the BNP, led by President Zia's widow, Begum Khaleda Zia, parliamentary elections were held on schedule in May 1986. The Jatiya Party won a modest majority of the 300 elected seats in the National Assembly. The participation of the Awami League‚Äîled by the late President Mujib's daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wajed‚Äîlent the elections some credibility, despite widespread charges of voting irregularities. Ershad resigned as Army Chief of Staff and retired from military service in preparation for the presidential elections, scheduled for October. Protesting that martial law was still in effect, both the BNP and the AL refused to put up opposing candidates. Ershad easily outdistanced the remaining candidates, taking 84% of the vote. Although Ershad's government claimed a turnout of more than 50%, opposition leaders, and much of the foreign press, estimated a far lower percentage and alleged voting irregularities. Ershad continued his stated commitment to lift martial law. In November 1986, his government mustered the necessary two-thirds majority in the National Assembly to amend the constitution and confirm the previous actions of the martial law regime. The President then lifted martial law, and the opposition parties took their elected seats in the National Assembly. Bangladeshi pro-democracy activist Noor Hossain photographed by Dinu Alam before he was killed, protesting the autocratic rule of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. In July 1987, however, after the government hastily pushed through a controversial legislative bill to include military representation on local administrative councils, the opposition walked out of Parliament. Passage of the bill helped spark an opposition movement that quickly gathered momentum, uniting Bangladesh's opposition parties for the first time. The government began to arrest scores of opposition activists under the country's Special Powers Act of 1974. Despite these arrests, opposition parties continued to organise protest marches and nationwide strikes. After declaring a state of emergency, Ershad dissolved Parliament and scheduled fresh elections for March 1988. All major opposition parties refused government overtures to participate in these polls, maintaining that the government was incapable of holding free and fair elections. Despite the opposition boycott, the government proceeded. The ruling Jatiya Party won 251 of the 300 seats. The Parliament, while still regarded by the opposition as an illegitimate body, held its sessions as scheduled, and passed numerous bills, including, in June 1988, a controversial constitutional amendment making Islam Bangladesh's state religion and provision for setting up High Court benches in major cities outside of Dhaka. While Islam remains the state religion, the provision for decentralising the High Court division has been struck down by the Supreme Court. By 1989, the domestic political situation in the country seemed to have quieted. The local council elections were generally considered by international observers to have been less violent and more free and fair than previous elections. However, opposition to Ershad's rule began to regain momentum, escalating by the end of 1990 in frequent general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. =Devolution and Local government Act= To improve rural administration, Ershad introduced the Upazila and Zila Parishad system. He held the 'first democratic elections for these village councils' in 1985. 1990s =Transition to democracy= A wide umbrella of political parties united against Ershad. Ziaur Rahman's widow, Khaleda Zia, led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which allied with the Bangladesh Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter Sheikh Hasina. Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and other Islamic parties and alliances joined the opposition ranks. They called for strikes and protests that paralysed the state and its economy. Although the parliament was dissolved, fresh elections were boycotted by the opposition, including Awami League and Jamaat. Students launched an intensifying opposition campaign, which ultimately forced Ershad to step down. On 6 December 1990, Ershad offered his resignation. On 27 February 1991, after two months of widespread civil unrest, an interim government headed by Acting President Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed oversaw what most observers believed to be the nation's most free and fair elections to that date. =First Khaleda administration, 1991‚Äì96= Prime minister Zia with United States President Bill Clinton. The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party won a plurality of seats and formed a government with support from the Islamic party Jamaat-I-Islami, with Khaleda Zia, widow of Ziaur Rahman, obtaining the post of prime minister. Only four parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1991 Parliament: The BNP, led by Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia; the AL, led by Sheikh Hasina; the Jamaat-I-Islami (JI), led by Ghulam Azam; and the Jatiya Party (JP), led by acting chairman Mizanur Rahman Choudhury while its founder, former President Ershad, served out a prison sentence on corruption charges. The electorate approved still more changes to the constitution, formally re-creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister, as in Bangladesh's original 1972 constitution. In October 1991, members of Parliament elected a new head of state, President Abdur Rahman Biswas. In March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the opposition claimed the government had rigged, led to an indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a program of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament. The opposition then continued a campaign of marches, demonstrations, and strikes in an effort to force the government to resign. The opposition, including the Bangladesh Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996. In February, Khaleda Zia was re-elected by a landslide in voting boycotted and denounced as unfair by the three main opposition parties. In March 1996, following escalating political turmoil, the sitting Parliament enacted a constitutional amendment to allow a neutral caretaker government to assume power and conduct new parliamentary elections; former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman was named Chief Adviser (a position equivalent to Prime Minister) in the interim government. New parliamentary elections were held in June 1996 and the Awami League won plurality and formed the government with support from the Jatiya Party led by deposed president Hussain Muhammad Ershad; party leader Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister of Bangladesh. =First Hasina administration, 1996‚Äì2001= Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inspects the ceremonial honour guard during a full honour arrival ceremony at the Pentagon on 17 October 2000. Sheikh Hasina formed what she called a \\"Government of National Consensus\\" in June 1996, which included one minister from the Jatiya Party and another from the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. The Jatiya Party never entered into a formal coalition arrangement, and party president Hussain Muhammad Ershad withdrew his support from the government in September 1997. Only three parties had more than 10 members elected to the 1996 Parliament: the Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party. Jatiya Party president, Ershad, was released from prison on bail in January 1997. International and domestic election observers found the June 1996 election free and fair, and ultimately, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party decided to join the new Parliament. The BNP soon charged that police and Bangladesh Awami League activists were engaged in large-scale harassment and jailing of opposition activists. At the end of 1996, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party staged a parliamentary walkout over this and other grievances but returned in January 1997 under a four-point agreement with the ruling party. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party asserted that this agreement was never implemented and later staged another walkout in August 1997. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998. In June 1999, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other opposition parties again began to abstain from attending Parliament. Opposition parties staged an increasing number of nationwide general strikes, rising from six days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000. In July 2001, the Bangladesh Awami League government stepped down to allow a caretaker government to preside over parliamentary elections. Political violence that had increased during the Bangladesh Awami League government's tenure continued to increase through the summer in the run up to the election. In August, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina agreed during a visit of former President Jimmy Carter to respect the results of the election, join Parliament win or lose, forswear the use of hartals (violently enforced strikes) as political tools, and if successful in forming a government allow for a more meaningful role for the opposition in Parliament. The caretaker government was successful in containing the violence, which allowed a parliamentary general election to be successfully held on 1 October 2001. 2000s =Second Khaleda administration, 2001‚Äì2006= The Four Party Alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party won over a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Begum Khaleda Zia was sworn in on 10 October 2001, as Prime Minister for the third time (first in 1991, second after the 15 February 1996 elections). Despite her August 2001 pledge and all election monitoring groups declaring the election free and fair, Sheikh Hasina condemned the election, rejected the results, and boycotted Parliament. In 2002, however, she led her party legislators back to Parliament, but the Bangladesh Awami League again walked out in June 2003 to protest derogatory remarks about Hasina by a State Minister and the allegedly partisan role of the Parliamentary Speaker. In June 2004, the AL returned to Parliament without having any of their demands met. They then attended Parliament irregularly before announcing a boycott of the entire June 2005 budget session. On 17 August 2005, near-synchronized blasts of improvised explosive devices in 63 out of 64 administrative districts targeted mainly government buildings and killed two persons. An extremist Islamist group named Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) claimed responsibility for the blasts, which aimed to press home JMB's demand for a replacement of the secular legal system with Islamic sharia courts. Subsequent attacks on the courts in several districts killed 28 people, including judges, lawyers, and police personnel guarding the courts. A government campaign against the Islamic extremists led to the arrest of hundreds of senior and mid-level JMB leaders. Six top JMB leaders were tried and sentenced to death for their role in the murder of two judges; another leader was tried and sentenced to death in absentia in the same case. In February 2006, the AL returned to Parliament, demanded early elections and requested significant changes in the electoral and caretaker government systems to stop alleged moves by the ruling coalition to rig the next election. The AL blamed the BNP for several high-profile attacks on opposition leaders and asserted the BNP was bent on eliminating Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League as a viable force. The BNP and its allies accused the AL of maligning Bangladesh at home and abroad out of jealousy over the government's performance on development and economic issues. Dialogue between the Secretaries General of the main ruling and opposition parties failed to sort out the electoral reform issues. =Political crisis and Caretaker government, 2006‚Äì2008= Hamid Karzai, Pervez Musharraf, and Fakhruddin Ahmed at the Annual Meeting 2008 of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland The months preceding the planned 22 January 2007, elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia's government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker government. The caretaker government had difficulty bringing the all parties to the table. Awami League and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favoured the BNP. The interim period was marked by violence and strikes. Presidential Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury negotiated with Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia and brought all the parties to the planned 22 January 2007 parliamentary elections. Later Hussain Muhammad Ershad's nomination was cancelled; as a result, the Grand Alliance withdrew its candidates en masse on the last day possible. They demanded to have voters' lists published. Later in the month, the president Iajuddin Ahmed imposed a state of emergency. Iajuddin Ahmed resigned from the post of chief adviser, under the pressure of Bangladesh Army, and appointed Fakhruddin Ahmed, the new chief adviser. Political activity was prohibited. The military- backed government worked to develop graft and corruption cases against leaders and members of both major parties. In March 2007, Khaleda Zia's two sons, who both had positions in Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were charged with corruption. Hasina was charged with graft and extortion in April 2007, and a day later, Khaleda Zia was charged with graft as well. There was attempt by Bangladesh Army chief Moeen U Ahmed, the head of Anti-Terrorism division of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Brigadier General ATM Amin, and Director of Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Brigadier General Chowdhury Fazlul Bari to remove Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia from politics. Former Army Chief, General Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, was made the head of Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission. The Anti Corruption Commission and the Bangladesh Election Commission were strengthened by the caretaker government. On 27 August 2007 violence broke out in the University of Dhaka campus between students and soldiers of Bangladesh Army. Students called strikes and burned effigies of the army chief. Police attacked the students and physically assaulted Acting Vice-chancellor Prof AFM Yusuf Haider and other faculty members of the University of Dhaka. Students were joined in demonstration by street vendors and slum residents who were evicted by the government. Bangladesh Army agreed to the demands of the protesters and removed the Army camp from the University of Dhaka campus. Students and teachers expressed the continued state of emergency in Bangladesh. =Second Hasina administration= Sheikh Hasina with Vladimir Putin in Moscow The Awami league won national election on 29 December 2008 as part of a larger electoral alliance that also included the Jatiya Party led by former military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad as well as some leftist parties. According to the Official Results, Bangladesh Awami League won 230 out of 299 constituencies, and together with its allies, had a total of 262 parliamentary seats. The Awami League and its allies received 57% of the total votes cast. The AL alone got 48%, compared to 36% of the other major alliance led by the BNP which by itself got 33% of the votes. Sheikh Hasina, as party head, is the new Prime Minister. Her term of office began on 7 January 2009 after Fakhruddin Ahmed. The new cabinet had several new faces, including three women in prominent positions: Dr Dipu Moni (Foreign Minister), Matia Chowdhury (Agriculture Minister) and Sahara Khatun (Home Minister). Younger MPs with a link to assassinated members of the 1972‚Äì1975 AL government are Syed Ashraful Islam, son of Syed Nazrul Islam, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, son of Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni, and Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj, son of Tajuddin Ahmad. Since 2009, the Awami League government faced several major political challenges, including BDR (border security force) mutiny, power crisis, unrest in garments industry and stock market fluctuations. Judicial achievements for the party included restoring 1972 constitution (set by the first Awami League government), beginning of war crimes trials, and guilty vedict in 1975 assassination trial. According to the Nielsen 2-year survey, 50% felt the country was moving in the right direction, and 36% gave the government a favourable rating. On 18 September 2012 Bangladesh Supreme Court declared the caretaker government led by . =Vision 2021 and Digital Bangladesh= Vision 2021 was the political manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League party before winning the National Elections of 2008. It stands as a political vision of Bangladesh for the year 2021, the golden jubilee of the nation. The policy has been criticized as a policy emblematic of technological optimism in the context of Bangladesh and the state repression of media, low internet penetration, inadequate electricity generation. The Vision 2021 is an articulation of where this nation needs to be in 2021 ‚Äì the year which marks the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence. Digital Bangladesh implies the broad use of computers, and embodies the modern philosophy of effective and useful use of technology in terms of implementing the promises in education, health, job placement and poverty reduction. The party underscored a changing attitude, positive thinking and innovative ideas for the successes of ‚ÄúDigital Bangladesh‚Äù. 2010s =War crimes tribunal= 2013 Shahbag protests, Protest against the war criminals in Shahbagh, Bangladesh. During the 2008 general election, the Awami League (AL) pledged to establish the tribunals in response to long-standing calls for trying war criminals. The first indictments were issued in 2010. However, the main perpetrators of the war crimes, the Pakistan soldiers, remained out of the reach of the courts. The government set up the tribunal after the Awami League won the general election in December 2008 with a more than two-thirds majority in parliament. The War Crimes Fact Finding Committee, tasked to investigate and find evidence, completed its report in 2008, identifying 1,600 suspects. Prior to the formation of the ICT, the United Nations Development Programme offered assistance in 2009 on the tribunal's formation. In 2009, the parliament amended the 1973 act that authorised such a tribunal to update it. =Third Hasina administration, 2014‚Äì2019= General election were held in Bangladesh on 5 January 2014, in accordance with the constitutional requirement that the election must take place within the 90-day period before the expiration of the term of the Jatiyo Sangshad on 24 January 2014. The elections were controversial, with almost all major opposition parties boycotting and 154 of the total 300 seats being uncontested. Around 21 people were killed on polling day. =2014 Bangladesh anti-Hindu violence= On 5 January 2014, the 10th general elections were held in Bangladesh. The Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami had already boycotted the elections. The buildup to the elections were marred by successive strikes and violence by the opposition parties. Victims claimed after the polls, workers and supporters of the opposition parties began attacking the minority Bengali Hindus. Accusing of looting, vandalising and setting the Hindu houses on fire in several districts across the country. Seven persons belonging to the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party were arrested in connection with the attacks. The National Human Rights Commission held the government responsible for the attacks on Hindus after the election. =Attacks on secularists= From 2013, a number of secularist writers, bloggers and publishers in Bangladesh have been killed or seriously injured in attacks perpetrated by Islamist extremists. The attacks have taken place at a time of growing tension between Bangladeshi secularists, who want the country to maintain its secularist tradition of separation of religion and state, and Islamists, who want an Islamic state. Tensions have also risen as a result of the country's war crimes tribunal, which has recently convicted several members of the opposition Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party for crimes committed during Bangladesh's bloody war of independence in 1971. Secularists have been calling for harsher penalties for the convicted, with some calling for the Jamaat-e-Islam party itself to be outlawed, drawing the ire of the party's supporters. Responsibility for the attacks on secularists which have since occurred have been claimed by a number of militant groups including Ansarullah Bangla Team, who have frequently justified their attacks on the grounds that their victims are \\"atheists\\" and enemies of Islam. Four bloggers had been killed in 2015, but only 4 people were arrested in the murder cases. =Student protests against VAT on education= Uttara, Dhaka protest VAT on tuition fees. The 2015 Bangladesh student protests on \\"No VAT on Education\\" were protests by students of private universities in Bangladesh demanding the VAT imposed on higher education in private universities be eliminated. The present Finance Minister of the Bangladesh Awami League government first introduced a 10% VAT upon higher education in private universities in the draft of budget of 2015‚Äì16. Following strong opposition, the VAT was reduced to 7.5%. The imposed VAT was withdrawn by the finance division after a cabinet meeting on 14 September 2015. = Quota Reform Movement = Quota reform protesters at University of Dhaka The 2018 Bangladesh Quota Reform Movement is an ongoing students' movement demanding reforms in policies regarding recruitment in the Bangladesh government services. Bangladesh Sadharan Chhatra Adhikar Sangrakshan Parishad (Bangladesh General Students' Right Conservation Council) initiated movement initially began in Shahbag and on Dhaka University campus on 17 February 2018, and eventually spread country-wide by 8 April 2018. The movement rapidly attained popularity among students of different universities and colleges forcing the government to announce changes in its policy. = Road Safety Protests = Students blocking a road in Uttara, North Dhaka, 2 August 2018 A series of public protests in Bangladesh advocating improved road safety were held from 29 July to 8 August 2018. They were sparked by the deaths of two high-school students in Dhaka struck by a bus operated by an unlicensed driver who was racing to collect passengers. The incident impelled students to demand safer roads and stricter traffic laws, and the demonstrations rapidly spread throughout Bangladesh. The protests were peaceful until 2 August, when police attempted to disperse the demonstrators with tear gas and people believed to be members of a pro-government youth league attacked protesters and journalists. The government arrested several protesters and a photographer for giving an interview about the protests to international media. Various international organisations and high-profile figures expressed solidarity with the protesters. The crack-down on the student protesters received high criticism both domestically and internationally. The third Sheikh Hasina Cabinet approved on 6 August a draft traffic act stipulating capital punishment for intentional killing and a maximum five-year prison sentence for accidental killing with a motor vehicle. The protesters felt that the maximum five-year sentence was too light for accidental deaths due to reckless driving. By 8 August, the situation in the city had returned to normal, most students had returned to their classes and traffic had resumed as normal, with many sources stating that the nine-day protests were over.https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/08/10/dhaka-traffic- chaos-returns-as-campaign-for-safe-roads-peters- outhttp://southasiajournal.net/bangladesh-students-started-an-enduring- movement-even-as-street-protests-end/ =Fourth Hasina administration= 2018 Bangladeshi general election were held on 30 December 2018.EC reschedules election date to December 30 Dhaka Tribune, 12 November 2018 The result was a landslide victory for the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina. The elections were marred by violence and claims of vote rigging. Opposition leader Kamal Hossain rejected the results, calling it \\"farcical\\" and demanding fresh elections to be held under a neutral government.  2020s  =Mujib Year and Golden jubilee = The government of Bangladesh has announced the commemoration of 2020-2021 as the Mujib Year () on the occasion of the centennial birth anniversary of the founding leader of the country, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman .

He is perhaps best known in the United Kingdom for establishing the Welsh Hawking Club (Clwb Hebogwyr Cymru). He was also an honorary member of the British Falconers Club, the Hawking Club of Great Britain, the North American Falconry Club, the Austrian, German and French Associations. He was born in Szeged, Hungary in 1910. His father's (√Ål√°dar Bastyai Holtzer) love of hunting, horses and racing pigeons fuelled Lorant's early passion for nature and birds in particular. A chance encounter with a visiting British falconer launched a career that would span 60 years and have a profound impact in reviving a sport that had become all but extinct. Background According to the English falconer Major C R E Radclyffe: \\"in the summer of 1902 my friend Prince Odescalchi asked me to introduce falconry to Hungary.Major C R E Radclyffe 'Round the Smoking Room Fire', London, John Murray, 1933, p 99 It seems ironic that British falconers were asked to reintroduce falconry to the lands where its spread across Europe, bought from the east by the Huns and Magyars, first began over 1.000 years ago. In early 20th century Britain, the sport was also virtually unknown and Radclyffe was one of only a handful of active falconers. He sent Richard Best, falconer to the famous Old Hawking Club, along with members of the infant British Falconer's Club and a team of peregrines, to Prince Odescalchi where they enjoyed good hawking on the Hungarian plains near Tusz√©r. Sadly, the prince was killed in the Great War and the rebirth of Hungarian falconry was delayed.\\" In 1930, Lord G√©za Kiss de Nemesk√©r was shooting in Scotland and met a lady interested in falconry. On learning that there were no falconers in Hungary, Mrs MacLean arranged for a friend of hers, Colonel Stephen Biddulph, to visit with his falconers. Colonel Biddulph was a retired officer in the British Indian Army and arrived in Hungary with falconers from the north of India (now Pakistan) to set up a hawking establishment at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. Lorant, then aged 16, was returning to school in Budapest from the summer break on his uncle's farm in Szeged. He chanced upon one of the Pakistani falconers travelling on the same train. Lorant spoke no Urdu and the falconer no Hungarian, but it was clear they shared an interest, and Lorant was invited to G√∂d√∂ll√∂.

It mirrors the growing awareness of the importance of wildlife issues in general and falconry in particular. In 1939, Lorant founded the Hungarian Falconry Association, in which he served as Falcon Master. Regrettably shortly after its formation, World War II and four years in the Hungarian army postponed the career path. In 1950 he established the Magyar S√≥lym√°sz Egyes√ºlet (Hungarian Birds of Prey Centre), which was affiliated to the Budapest Zoo. Such was the success of this school, Lorant was soon appointed head of the Aviary Section and, in 1953, curator of the zoo. Lorant and George Lelovich convinced the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture to adopt new pest control methods. Shooting, which damaged the rice crops and fish in the shallow waters, was superseded by hawking. Fish farmers were taught to control herons with falcons flown at them from horseback. Hawks were also employed to protect vineyards. Through their work, raptors were elevated from the level of verminous pests to that of valid assets in the environment. After learning much of his craft from men employed by a British falconer, in a strange twist of fate Lorant was about to return the favour. Following the Hungarian Uprising in 1956, he moved to Great Britain, where he was to play a major role in revitalizing interest in British falconry. United Kingdom Lorant came to Britain after the Hungarian National Uprising in 1957 to join his mother and elder brother in Stratford- upon-Avon. By this time, he numbered some of the greatest names in European falconry, such as Renz Waller, Gustel Eutermoser, Friedrich Remmler, and George Lelovich (to whom Lorant introduced falconry) amongst his friends and associates.

This helped him to secure a job with conservationist Peter Scott at his Slimbridge Wildfowl Reserve and subsequently with the renowned London taxidermist Roland Ward. At Slimbridge, among other projects, Lorant worked on the breeding scheme for the Hawaiian goose, which was nearly extinct except for the specimens held there. He was also responsible for capturing migrating Russian white-fronted geese for ringing. In the late 1950s, Lorant was featured several times on Peter Scott's BBC Television programme Look. At Slimbridge Lorant met Nancy, who was to become his devoted wife and whom he described affectionately in the dedication of his 1982 English language title All My Life with Hunting Birds as \\"my best assistant falconer for so many years\\".Lorant de Bastyai, 'All My Life with Hunting Birds' Sudbury: Neville Spearman, 1982, p. v. While he was working at the Newport Museum in South Wales, the idea for a Welsh Hawking Club was born. Publicity from the South Wales Argus brought other interested members of the public to the first meetings, and before long, Lorant was giving lessons in how to manage and train hawks at his then home, Yewberry Cottage in Malpas, near Newport, Wales. Initially, hawks were in short supply. A club trip to the DFO meeting at Kircham, Bavaria, led to many WHC members returning with hawks. Around this period, Lorant was also a very active member of the British Falconers' Club, contributing to a number of article on his experiences and on research into wild birds of prey to the Club's journal, The Falconer. Some of these articles were reprinted in Lorant's books. He also participated in the BFC's flying demonstrations at the annual Game Fair. By 1963, the WHC was becoming a fully established club in its own right, and began to organise its own field meetings which would eventually attract falconers from all over Europe and beyond. A second Club trip to Osterreichischer Falknerbund's international meeting in 1963 saw members bringing back more goshawks and the Czech golden eagle, Tatra The following year, Lorant moved from Newport to take up a position at the Welsh Mountain Zoo in Colwyn Bay, North Wales. His time there was not without incident - in November 1964 one of the tawny eagles flew off into a wood and was killed by a man out shooting. The case came to court, a summary was written by Jack Mavrogordato for The Falconer,J.G.Mavrogordato, The Case of the Shot Tawny Eagle, The Falconer, Vol IV, No 5, p. 233. and the Zoo was afforded damages. Lorant did not work there for long: he became seriously ill and, after a long recovery, was not well enough to resume his duties. Returning to the Midlands, Lorant moved to Leamington Spa, near his family in Stratford, and established a taxidermy business of his own. His first book in English, Hunting Bird from a Wild Bird, was published by Pelham Books in June, 1968. This received a somewhat negative review in the BFC journal, since the reviewer felt that the publishers should have found someone to help with Lorant's English, but it was nevertheless a popular title, and an American edition was also published. Both are now highly collectable titles. During the 1970s, a chronic hip problem made Lorant less able to actively fly hawks at quarry, but he continued to give demonstrations at the game fairs and attended international field meetings across Europe, and those of the club he had established. The WHC held its first international meeting in October 1972 in Lichfield, Staffordshire. This was attended by, amongst other, Count Friedrich Mensdorff-Pouilly and Jacques Renaud. The next year WHC members joined the BFC for the 1973 Woodhall Spa meeting, as a commemorative badge shows. Lorant remained a great writer of letters to falconers all over the world and it is said that Nancy was often concerned about the postage bills. Lorant continued to write articles for the Hungarian falconry journal, Nimrod. and the WHC journal The Austringer.Lorant de Bastyai, Return of Traditional Falconry, Austringer, 1981, p. 33. In 1976, Lorant, after flying his falcons at the game fair held that year in Wales, met the Prince of Wales and presented him with an ornate falconer's glove. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Lorant continued to make visits overseas, and was always overjoyed when opportunities to visit Hungary arose. Lorant's great friend John Buckner recalled that his \\"greatest joy was to show us the beauties of his beloved Budapest and to take us to the Zoological Gardens to show us where he had worked and to meet old friends.\\"John Buckner, Obituary: Lorant de Bastyai, Austringer, 1994, p. 30. Fellow falconer David Bowman recalls Lorant's last visit to Hungary, when the MSE meeting presented him with a medal to recognize his lifelong service to falconry. Unable to get up the stairs to the meeting on the third floor because of bad legs and the building not having an elevator, he was carried up in a chair by young falconers in the manner of royalty, which, of course, in falconry terms Lorant was.David Bowman, Obituary: Lorant de Bastyai, The Falconer 1993, p. 16. After a lifetime of falconry and service to the sport, Lorant died peacefully at home in Leamington on October 14, 1993, just short of his 83rd birthday. His widow Nancy de Bastyai wrote an article on their infamous Morris Traveller, published in The Austringer.Nancy de Bastyai, Time for a Change, Austringer 1992, p. 15. Following Lorant's death, the Welsh Hawking Club appointed her lifetime vice-president. She maintained their Leamington home as a heritage site and continued to welcome falconry friends from around the world. 'Leslie', Lorant's last surviving falcon, lived on under her care to the remarkable age of 27. Nancy died on 29 December 2009.Jump up, page 4, issue #80, Falconers magazine, publ.

The Fall River Line and Old Colony Railroad are on the left. The American Printing Company, located in Fall River, Massachusetts grew to become the largest producer of printed cotton cloth in the United States by the early 20th Century. The company grew as an offshoot of the Fall River Iron Works, established in 1821 by Colonel Richard Borden and Major Bradford Durfee. The American Print Works was established in 1835 by Holder Borden. It employed several thousand workers at its peak during World War I. Fall River Iron Works Metacomet Mill, built 1847 The early development of the textile industry in Fall River grew out of the developments made in nearby Rhode Island beginning with Samuel Slater at Pawtucket in 1793. The first textile mill in Fall River was built in 1811. Several more would follow between 1813 and 1821, along the \\"falling\\" Quequechan River for which the city was named. In 1821, Col. Richard Borden established the Fall River Iron Works, along with Maj. Bradford Durfee at the lower part of the Quequechan River. Bradford Durfee was a shipwright, and Richard Borden was the owner of a grist mill. After an uncertain start, in which some early investors pulled out, the Fall River Iron Works was incorporated in 1825, with $200,000 in capital. The Iron Works began producing nails, bar stock, and other items such as bands for casks in the nearby New Bedford whaling industry. They soon gained a reputation for producing nails of high quality, and business flourished. By 1833, Fall River had 13 cotton mills, employing 1,200 people, with 31,000 total spindles (a common measure of total spinning capacity) and 1,050 looms. The Iron Works would continue to play an important role in the early development of the textile industry in Fall River. By 1840, the Iron Works employed about 250 people and produced over 3.8 million pounds of nails, as well as 950 tons of iron hoops and 400 tons of castings. By 1845, the company was valued at $960,000. In 1827, Col. Borden began regular steamship service to Providence, Rhode Island. F.R. Iron Works Providence, R.I. Always looking to diversify his holdings, Richard Borden constructed the Metacomet Mill in 1847, which today is the oldest remaining textile mill in the City, located on Anawan Street. The Iron Works also established the Fall River Gas Company in 1847, and manufactured gas from coal. In 1848, the Fall River Iron Works constructed an office and warehouse building along the waterfront in Providence, Rhode Island and retained the location until 1881. This building is still standing, and is now occupied by the Rhode Island School of Design. Providence Site Info By 1876, the Iron Works occupied two sites, consisting of a rolling mill, a nail mill and a foundry. It had an average annual production of 7,000 tons.Directory of iron and steel works of the United States and Canada, 1876 American Print Works In 1824, Andrew Robeson, arrived from New Bedford and established the first Print Works in the City,The New England states: their constitutional, judicial, educational, commercial, professional and industrial history, Volume 1 a segment of the industry that Fall River would in later years come to dominate. The American Print Works was established in 1835 by Holder Borden, nephew of Colonel Richard.The Run of the Mill, Dunwell, Steve, 1978 Located along the shore of Mount Hope Bay, its location would prove ideal as ocean-going ships were able to dock at the company's doorstep. In the 1840s, the railroad would be extended to the Print Works site, adjacent to the steamship pier with regular service to Providence and New York City. Both the steamships and the railroad were controlled by Colonel Richard Borden, and later his sons and nephews. In 1853, the nearby Globe Print Works was acquired by Richard Borden, his brother Jefferson and Oliver Chace. It was renamed the Bay State Print Works, and was later reorganized.Bristol County Biographies, J. H. Beers & Co. (1912) For three generations, the Borden family dynasty would have control or business interests in the City's banks, the gas company, steamboats, railroads and mines. (Lizzie Borden, the famed alleged axe-murderer in 1892 was the great- granddaughter of an uncle of Colonel Richard Borden). Expansion Printing Room, American Print Works, about 1910 Fall River profited well from the American Civil War and was in a fine position to take advantage of the prosperity that followed. By 1868, it had surpassed Lowell as the leading textile city in the United States with over 500,000 total spindles. The American Print Works was set to open a new factory in 1867, when a disastrous fire occurred. It was a major setback for the company, as the final arrangements for insurance were in the process of being completed when the fire happened. However, the American Print Works was soon rebuilt in 1868, bigger and better than it was before. A Centennial History of Fall River, Mass. A few years later during 1871 and 1872, a most dramatic expansion occurred within the City of Fall River, when 15 new corporations were founded, building 22 new mills throughout the city, while some of the older mills expanded. The city's population increased by an astounding 20,000 people during these two years, while overall mill capacity double to more than 1,000,000 spindles. The main product of these mills was print cloth, the vast majority of which, passed through the American Print Works. By 1876, the city had 1/6 of all New England cotton capacity, and one-half of all print cloth production. \\"King Cotton\\" had definitely arrived. The \\"Spindle City\\" as it became known, was second in the world to only Manchester, England. Indigo Blue & White printed cloth, American Printing Company, from a company catalog, about 1910 However, the 1870s would be a trying time for the textile industry, beginning with the Panic of 1873. The American Print Works failed in 1879, a result of the uninsured losses suffered in the 1867 fire, and was reorganized as the American Printing Company 1880. At its peak in 1876, the Iron Works employed 600 men. However, just a few years later in 1880, the Iron Works property was divided among shareholders and production of iron ceased soon after, as a result of increased competition from other companies closer to the mines. In 1887, M.C.D. Borden, son of Col. Richard gain control of the company's stock, and tore down the old buildings of the iron works, and began the construction of several huge new cloth-producing mills, adjacent to the American Printing Company. These new mills would be known as the \\"Iron Works Division\\" of the APC. Three huge warehouses were also built along the lower portion of Anawan Street, to store the many copper printing rollers required for the production of print cloth, as well as to store customer's orders until they needed them. Mill Number 7 was built in 1905 further up on Anawan Street, and still stands today. The Narrows Center for the Arts occupies one of the former warehouse buildings. In 1917, the American Printing Company was capitalized at $2,000,000. The Fall River Iron Works, the cloth-producing division of the company and had a huge capacity of 485,288 ring spindles and 12,702 looms. The print works had the capacity to print 125,000 pieces per week.Official American Textile Directory, 1917 Decline APC Warehouses, Anawan Street, Fall River The cotton mills of Fall River had built their business largely on only one product: print cloth. About 1910, the city's largest employer, the American Printing Company (APC) employed 6,000 people, and was the largest printer of cotton cloth in the world. Dozens of other city mills solely produced print cloth to be printed at the APC. The city's industry truly had all its eggs in one, very large basket. By 1910, or so, the Northern mills also faced serious competition from their Southern counterparts due to factors such as lower labor and transportation costs, as well as the South's large investment in new machinery and other equipment. Many northern mills added additional capacity, in a futile attempt to maintain their advantage over the South. World War I had provided a much needed boost in demand for textiles, and most of the mills in New England benefited during this time. The post-war economy quickly slowed however and production quickly outpaced demand. The price for print cloth dropped sharply. In 1923, Fall River faced the first wave of mill closures. In 1924, following the example of some other large northern mills, the American Printing Company built a new plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, and began moving much of its production there. Thousands of Fall River jobs were suddenly lost. The once mighty American Printing Company finally closed its Fall River mills for good in 1934. In 1937, their huge factory complex on Water Street was acquired by the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, and soon employed 2,600 people. On October 11‚Äì12, 1941, just eight weeks\\"Firestone Plant is Ravaged,\\" Fall River Herald News, Oct. 12, 1941, p.1. before the attack on Pearl harbor, a huge fire broke out in the old 1860s mill of the print works. The fire was a major setback to the U.S. war effort, as Jesse H. Jones, Secretary of Commerce, reported that 15,850 tons () of rubber was lost in the blaze, valued at approximately $7,000,000.\\"No Sabotage Found in Firestone Blaze by FBI Men Making Probe.\\" Fall River, Herald News, October 14, 1941, p.1 In March 1973, another huge fire destroyed the former \\"Iron Works Division\\" mills. These mills were set to be occupied by the Providence Pile Company. However, the sprinklers had been turned off during the winter because there was no heat in the buildings. Today, the site is occupied by Borden & Remington Chemical Company(a company with its roots in the 19th century textile industry). Several of the late 19th Century buildings still remain. In October 2008, Borden & Remington began the demolition of Mill No. 3, which had been vacant and was deemed to be in poor condition. Mill No. 1 was demolished in May 2011. Much of the old growth Longleaf Pine timbers used to construct the buildings were salvaged during demolition and have been recycled into new flooring and millwork products.

(\\"The Americans are coming!\\") was a slogan used in Romania in the 1940s and 1950s, encapsulating the hope that an American-led invasion of Eastern Europe would topple the Soviet-backed, Communist-dominated government installed in early 1945. This notion helped sustain an anti-communist resistance movement and emboldened the civilians who aided it. Resistance groups The great expectation of the resistance groups that had withdrawn into the mountains was that a new world war would break out between the British and the Americans on one side, and the Soviets on the other. Under this scenario, the Soviet troops then occupying Romania would be driven out by the United States Army with help from the local resistance. Groups in Transylvania were prepared to eliminate communist officials as soon as war began, and take control of their particular region. They built supply lines with the local population, gathered armaments, munitions and money, and developed plans to attack institutions and communications networks. They were a prime target of the Securitate, which viewed them as agents of the American imperialists seeking to destabilize the regime.Barbu, p.47-8 There were smaller groups who fled to the mountains simply to avoid persecution, without plans to topple the government, but they too hoped their efforts would be rewarded by America. For instance, the Arnota group hid in the mountains of northern Oltenia in winter 1949, planning to resist until a US invasion, which they expected that summer. After their capture in April, one of their members told Securitate investigators, \\"the goal of setting up in the mountains was to remain until around June, when we were told... an armed intervention by the Americans would take place, which would overthrow the regime, the only ones who would do it, because a domestic intervention has no chance of succeeding...\\"Barbu, p.48 Resistance groups uniformly saw American aid as vital to their success. One of the accusations put forth at the trial of the Sumanele Negre group was that its members had developed contacts with American intelligence officers, together studying the possibility of collaborating and coming up with a plan to overthrow the regime. This accusation was repeated for most groups captured later on.Barbu, p.49 American sources confirm the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency tried to develop links with Romanian partisans at the end of the 1940s. The Office of Policy Coordination recruited Romanian refugees in Western Europe starting in 1949. The latter were ready to establish contacts with resistance groups, whom they intended to supply with light arms, munitions, radio transmitters and medicines. To this end, the OPC created training camps in Italy, France, and Greece, where recruits learned how to use radio transmitters and make parachute jumps. Exiled former Iron Guard members, working with American and French officers, developed a plan of their own, involving the parachuting of 50 men into Romania who would then contact mountain resistance groups. Preparations took place in the French Occupation Zone of Germany, around Paris, and in the south of France, with a focus on parachute jumping, night-time orientation, and shooting. Parachute jumps happened especially in Transylvania between 1950 and 1953, but many of those who dropped in were caught by the Securitate.Barbu, p.49-50 10 or 13 of them were executed in 1953, and recruitment ceased the following year.Barbu, p.157 The mountain groups placed great hope on the parachutes, awaiting money, arms, and munitions, but especially the signal that America was about to go to war. For instance, in the early 1950s, the Ion GavrilƒÉ group in the FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü Mountains tried contacting the Romanian National Committee in the United States, sending them a letter with the geographic coordinates where food and arms should be dropped. The group also tried sending a letter to the American legation in Bucharest in 1955, describing its harsh living conditions.Barbu, p.50 American planes were also eagerly awaited by peasants and shepherds who helped the partisans, not only for political reasons, but also because the latter took food from them, promising to pay using money found in parachuted parcels. In 1953, for instance, the GavrilƒÉ and Gheorghe Arsenescu‚Äì groups promised local shepherds they would pay the considerable sum of 100 lei per kilogram of cheese if a package containing 250,000 lei were found. This shows that as late as 1953, resistance groups and those who helped them were still motivated by the hope that America had not forgotten them. The Securitate was aware of this: in 1953, a report on the GavrilƒÉ group claimed it was aided by \\"enemy elements, with a philo-American mentality\\".Barbu, p.51 The activity of the resistance groups was directly linked to the hope that \\"the Americans are coming\\". Many Romanians believed these groups had close links to representatives from Washington and that an action leading to the regime's fall was only a matter of time. Western radio stations, first Voice of America and the BBC, and later Radio Free Europe, long maintained hope in an American intervention to free Eastern Europe. For resistance members, this conviction helped them continue their fight in dire conditions. General population A January 1946 article in the popular magazine Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ suggested that Romanians had been awaiting Americans' arrival since World War II, and hyperbolically presented the \\"benefits\\" of the bombing of Bucharest: \\"We waited for a long time and most of us thought we had waited in vain... But behold, something did come. These planes. Apparently destructive, they in fact brought salvation. Each American bomb was dropped in the service of high ideals of humanity, freedom, respect for human dignity and security\\".Barbu, p.110 The Soviet occupation, de facto begun in late August 1944, launched the \\"vin americanii\\" hope in earnest, but this was accentuated after November 1946, when the Communists won an election through intimidation and probable fraud, liquidated the opposition National Peasants' Party in July 1947, and forced King Michael to abdicate that December. These events made them realise that Communism could only be defeated through outside intervention. As American envoy Rudolf E. Schoenfeld reported in August 1948, \\"The most frequently heard question addressed by a Romanian to an American, when he dares speak to one, is: Why don't you do anything?\\" According to archives of the Interior Ministry, which took the possibility of intervention seriously, anti-communist and anti-Soviet statements by people were common in 1946-47, and truly widespread in 1948. Quite often, these statements expressed hope that the King and the historic political parties would come back to rule after an American intervention.Barbu, p.74-5 In 1946, rumour that war would begin was persistent, and would be continually recorded until 1950. Some believed the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty in February 1947 meant war; in May that year, it was thought Americans had bombed Soviet troops near BuzƒÉu; while that summer, rumours of an imminent war were prevalent in the northwest of the country.Barbu, p.77-8 In advance of the farcical 1948 election, numerous pro- American leaflets and graffiti were discovered, which continued into the next year. Among the messages found were \\"long live the republicans until the arrival of the Americans\\" and, written in Hungarian in Miercurea-Ciuc, \\"long live the American and British armies that will free the people from communist dictatorship\\".Barbu, p.78ff. Invasion rumours were often very precise, specifying the date and manner armed intervention would take. One scenario involved troops disembarking en masse at Constan≈£a on the Black Sea, brought over from Greece or Turkey. Another saw as many as 60,000 airplanes bombing strategic targets and driving out the Communists. Voice of America reports were amplified or distorted: for instance, when news of King Michael's meeting with President Harry S. Truman was broadcast in April 1948, it was said in BrƒÉila that the latter had assured him he would soon regain his throne, and in Bucharest, that he would be back home before Easter.Barbu, p.81ff. At the 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1953, a number of young Romanians approached Western journalists, given a rare opportunity to make their opinions known to the outside world. They tended to be discouraged but still awaited American help, a hope boosted by the Korean War. One of them gave a written message to a US journalist: \\"Romanians put all their hopes in the American people. Everyone has understood that 1953 is the year of liberation. The Romanian people remains silent, with an open wound. But at the first chance we get, we will erupt. You have already seen the misery in which Romanian peasants live. They are ready to destroy communism at the first opportunity. Please transmit to the American people the greetings of Romanians subjugated by the red beasts\\".Barbu, p.88-90 Disillusionment Anticipation gradually gave way to resignation and disappointment as the 1950s wore on,Barbu, p.90 but it was only after the failure of the United States to intervene during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 that hope for similar action in Romania was swept away. As historian Florin Constantinescu notes, \\"A strange phenomenon of collective psychology was the strong and enduring belief that the West and above all the USA would pull Romania from beneath the Soviet boot. 'Vin americanii' was an expression that summarized a political attitude but also a state of mind. These resisted all proof of disinterest in Western capitals toward the countries left behind the 'Iron Curtain' and only after the crushing of the Hungarian revolution by the Red Army in 1956, beneath the passive gaze of the West, did Eastern Europeans, among them Romanians, begin to abandon their hopes and face reality\\".Constantiniu, Florin. O istorie sincerƒÉ a poporului rom√¢n, p.450. Bucharest: Univers Enciclopedic, 1997 People turned to different ways of coping: flight, or the hope of flight; mental escape (Western music, yoga, bridge); and adopting Western lifestyles, to the extent this was possible.Barbu, p.73 In 2005, the Americans did finally announce they would come when an accord was reached allowing them a permanent base at Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu International Airport near Constan≈£a. The Communist regime had long since been overthrown, however, and the expression \\"vin americanii!\\" was used in a more jocular or ironic fashion this time around.

Running between New Malden and Pollards Hill, it is operated by London General. History Travel London Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in July 2008 Abellio London Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B7TL in Mitcham in October 2014 Route 152 originally operated from Mitcham Cricket Green to Kingston via Colliers Wood, South Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden, Tolworth, Hook, and Surbiton. On 27 May 1936, it was diverted at Hook to Hampton Court station via Hinchley Wood. On 27 June 1951, route 152 was extended to Feltham station via Teddington, with Kingston garage gaining an allocation in addition to the existing Merton garage allocation. The route reverted to sole operation by Merton garage from 9 May 1962. It continued to run to Mitcham, running every 20 minutes. The route reverted to sole operation by Merton garage from 9 May 1962. On 24 January 1970, it was diverted at Scilly Isles to Esher in lieu of Feltham. From the same date, the service was converted from AEC Regent III RT operation to one-man operation using single- deck AEC Merlins. From 18 May 1974, the service reverted to double-deck operation using Daimler Fleetlines. From 27 September 1980, the route was diverted at Tolworth to Surbiton station instead of Hampton Court, leaving the section of route to Hampton Court unserved except for some school journeys renumbered 152A. Under the major service cuts of 4 September 1982, single-deck operation returned to the route using Leyland Nationals. On 27 June 1987, route 152 was withdrawn between Surbiton and New Malden, diverting instead via route 131 to Kingston. On 26 November 1988, operation transferred to Sutton garage as part of the 'Sutton Bus' local tender unit, but operation gradually moved back to Merton garage. On 30 November 1991 Merton garage resumed full control, and the route was converted to single-deck midibus operation using Optare MetroRiders. This change was made in order to facilitate an extension of the route to Pollards Hill via Eastfields Estate, an area long-deprived of a bus service and beyond the remit of larger vehicles due to roadwidth restrictions, one of the factors in earlier proposals such as the re-routing of route 118 being shelved. On 30 November 1996, the route was converted to low floor operation with Dennis Darts. Upon being re-tendered, the route passed to Mitcham Belle on 1 December 2001.

A proposition such as \\"there is an afterlife\\" is verifiable if true but not falsifiable if false (if it's false, the individual will not know it's false, because they have no state of being). The term is most commonly used in relation to God and the afterlife, although there may be other propositions - such as moral propositions - which may also be verified after death. John Hick has expressed the premise as an allegory of a quest to a Celestial City. In this parable, a theist and an atheist are both walking down the same road. The theist believes there is a destination, the atheist believes there is not. If they reach the destination, the theist will have been proven right; however, if there is no destination on an endless road, this can never be verified. This is an attempt to explain how a theist expects some form of life or existence after death and an atheist does not. They both have separate belief systems and live life accordingly, but logically one is right and the other is not. If the theist is right, he will be proven so when he arrives in the afterlife. However, if the atheist is right, they will simply both be dead and nothing will be verified. This acts as a response to Verificationism. Under Hick's analogy claims about the afterlife are verifiable in principle because the truth becomes clear after death. To some extent it is therefore wrong to claim that religious language cannot be verified because it can (when you're dead).

Duke Eberhard of Franconia, a scion of the Conradine dynasty, had been a loyal supporter of the Liudolfing king Henry I of Germany (919-936). After the king's death however, he soon entered into conflict with his son and successor, Otto I, who did not see himself, as his father did, as primus inter pares. After Eberhard and other princes refused to pay homage to Otto in 937 his opponents joined Eberhard. In 938 he rebelled together with Otto‚Äôs elder half-brother Thankmar and the duke Eberhard of Bavaria. However, Thankmar was soon slain by Otto‚Äôs followers in the church of Eresburg (938), and Eberhard of Bavaria was replaced by his uncle Berthold. After a short reconciliation with Otto, Eberhard allied himself in 939 with Gilbert of Lorraine and Otto‚Äôs younger brother Henry of Bavaria to renew the rebellion. Gilbert, duke of Lorraine since 928, who had also been loyal during the rule of Henry I, now attempted to escape from his brother-in-law's sphere of influence and allied himself with the new king of the West Franks Louis IV, joining the revolt headed by Henry of Bavaria and Eberhard of Franconia. King Otto achieved at first a victory over the rebels in a battle in Birten close to Xanten, although he could only pray and watch on the other side of the Rhine. Nonetheless he was not able to capture the conspirators. Meanwhile, Gilbert and Eberhard went to the south and devastated the areas of royalist counts. They received support from Louis IV, from Otto's brother-in-law Hugh the Great and other important West Frankish rulers. When Otto besieged Breisach, the insurgents advanced from Metz to the Rhine and crossed it by Andernach. After the army went pillaging through the Niederlahngau, it started again to cross over the Rhine by Andernach. Gilbert and Eberhard were surprised by the two royalist counts, Konrad Kurzbold, count of Niederlahngau, and his cousin Udo, count of Wetterau and Rheingau. Although the Conradines and the cousins of Eberhard stood both on Otto's side, they followed the rebels with a small army and attacked only when the majority of the opposing army had already set with its booty over the Rhine. Eberhard was slain in the fight and Gilbert drowned in the Rhine when he attempted to escape to the other side. Thus ended the rebellion against Otto I.

The Act addresses investments made by foreign entities in the United States. The law strengthens pre-existing laws including the Exon-Florio Amendment and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. History =Legislative history= The United States House of Representatives passed the bill on February 28, 2007 by a vote of 423 to 0. The United States Senate passed their version of the bill on June 29, 2007 by unanimous consent. On July 11, 2007, the House passed the Senate's version, by a vote of 370‚Äì45. The bill establishes a framework for the review of foreign acquisitions of US assets by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS reform has been in the works since the Dubai Ports World transaction passed through CFIUS without a formal investigation, leaving a surprised and angry Congress determined to avoid a repetition of that scenario. Impetus for reform first began, however, when the China National Offshore Oil Corporation publicly announced an interest in UNOCAL in 2005, and even earlier that same year, when a GAO report revealed the lack of Congressional oversight and the degree to which some CFIUS transactions were escaping formal investigation through withdrawal of applications, among other things. Implementation The act was implemented by President George W. Bush's on January 23, 2008. The Act addresses many of the issues that have been the focus of concern since the 2005 report: it establishes transaction- specific and general Congressional notification requirements, creates rules that dictate how applications before CFIUS may be withdrawn, and specifically includes energy supplies among critical US assets requiring special consideration. More generally, the bill establishes more stringent rules for the review and formal investigation of transactions, especially those involving foreign governments or critical infrastructure assets. It also requires senior-level involvement in various required certifications and reports, limiting the agencies' delegation authority. In general, then, the bill's provisions convey the seriousness with which Congress expects the CFIUS agencies to approach future reviews. Key Provisions The bill's key provisions are as follows: ‚Ä¢ The bill establishes the membership of CFIUS by statute, and creates a defined role for the Director of National Intelligence as an ex officio member who must evaluate the transaction's national security implications. ‚Ä¢ On each future transaction, one of the member agencies would play a lead role, in addition to Treasury, depending on the transaction's subject matter. The lead agency would be responsible for negotiating and overseeing mitigation agreements. ‚Ä¢ Transactions that involve foreign governments, a threat to national security, or control of critical infrastructure must be subject to a 45-day formal investigation, except that exceptions are possible for foreign government transactions if the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Treasury and the lead agency certify that there is no national security threat. ‚Ä¢ The bill requires sign-off at the assistant secretary level (or above) that a transaction does not fall into one of these categories and need not go beyond the 30-day review period. Similar sign-off is required at the close of the 45-day investigation period to confirm that the transaction does not threaten national security. ‚Ä¢ CFIUS must report to Congress at the end of reviews and formal investigations. The bill also requires annual reports to Congress on the activities of CFIUS. ‚Ä¢ The bill provides explicit authority to CFIUS to require mitigation agreements. ‚Ä¢ Among the factors CFIUS must consider in its review are the impact of the transaction on critical infrastructure, broadly defined, as well as energy assets and critical technologies. In the case of foreign-government transactions, CFIUS must also consider the relevant country's compliance with US and multilateral counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and export control regimes. ‚Ä¢ The bill creates specific authority for CFIUS to enforce mitigation agreements. Further, it explicitly establishes CFIUS's \\"evergreen\\" authority to reopen a transaction that has been approved if there has been an intentional breach, and no other remedies will suffice. The bill also requires the publication of regulations that will standardize the filing process, as well as the process by which CFIUS communicates results to parties. And it requires CFIUS to publish guidelines concerning the types of transactions that have presented national security considerations, which could be helpful for companies trying to determine whether to make the so-called \\"voluntary\\" filing decision, especially now that withdrawals will be more closely regulated.

Biography Grant Robertson was born in 1869 and educated at Highgate School and Hertford College, Oxford.Obituary Nature 161, 510 (3 April 1948) He was elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1893. At Oxford he became a distinguished and influential historian. He was one-time tutor to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, and had many academic publications to his name. He also published a light work called \\"Voces academicae, short scenes of student life in Oxford\\" in 1898 and produced a series of romantic novels under the pseudonym Wymond Carey between 1902 and 1907. In 1920 Grant Robertson became Vice-Chancellor of Birmingham University.University of Birmingham Charter of Incorporation He is credited with doing much to raise the profile of the young university, with strong support for the new medical school, the library and the Barber Institute and one of his first tasks was to set up a Joint Standing Committee on ResearchEric Glasgow Library Review 2002 Volume: 51 Issue: 7 With regard to the library, he declared \\"A library is not a luxury, nor an ornamental appendage,but an absolute necessity‚Ä¶\\". The Charles Grant Robertson Scholarship at Birmingham University is awarded for research in the Department of English, and is open only to existing students of the university. Grant Robertson was Chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom (CVCP), later Universities UK from 1929 to 1935. Chairmen/Presidents of CVCP and Universities UK He was president of the Johnson Society at Lichfield from 1939 to 1944 The Johnson Society (Lichfield) In spite of his racy early writings, Grant Robertson was a rather aloof and prudish bachelor. He was particularly recalled as wordy, one commentator observing that he \\"never used a single word to express himself, if a paragraph could more gracefully define his meaning\\". Staff and students recalled incidents such as when his opening speech at a charity function was so long it dramatically reduced the takings, or when students we invited to tea but never had the chance to eat it. Harry Hodson recalled he was \\"a teacher by nature, and would lecture copiously among his contemporaries and juniors, little heeding if their attention wandered, raising the question, 'Can an interesting man be a bore?'

Vice Admiral Karo spent most of his working career in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which provided coastal maps and charts for the United States. He rose through the organization's bureaucracy to become the director of the Survey. \\"Vice Adm. H. Karo, 82, Dies; Headed U.S. Geodetic Survey,\\" New York Times. May 30, 1986. Karo had been involved in the Survey since 1923, but the advent of World War II forced him to take on other duties. In this period, he rose to the rank of rear admiral. At war's end, he returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. \\"Karo Heads Geodetic Survey,\\" New York Times. August 14, 1955. World War II Karo was transferred from the Coast and Geodeic Survey to the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, when he was commanding officer of the Air Force Aeronautical Chart Center in St. Louis. Initially, he was given the Army rank of major, and was promoted to colonel during this period, but he returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey as with the rank of rear admiral (see photo caption) at the end of the war. US Coast and Geodetic Survey President Dwight Eisenhower named Rear Admiral Karo to succeed Rear Admiral Robert Francis Anthony Studds as Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1955. The recess appointment was subsequently made permanent by Senate confirmation. \\"2 Appointments Approved,\\" New York Times. July 27, 1956. From 1955 through 1965, Karo directed the Survey. In 1957, Karo oversaw an organization with a $10-million budget, 17 ships and 2,000 employees. In that same year, the Survey's publications list offered over 2,000 aerial and nautical maps and guides; and over 44 million of its documents were issued. \\"Geodectic Survey on Job 150 Years; U.S. Agency Marks Birthday Today--Jefferson Signed Bill Creating Service,\\" New York Times.

Nimitz, Fleet Admiral, U.S. Navy. A mile is a unit of length, usually used to measure distance; however, the measurement varied amongst a number of national systems. There were (and remain today) some slight differences depending on whether a mile is construed in terms of Imperial units, United States customary units, or Norwegian/Swedish mil. In the 1950s, Karo headed the project which established the U.S. survey mile (also known as U.S. statute mile) of 5,280 survey feet which is slightly longer at approximately 1,609.347 219 meters (1 international mile is exactly 0.999 998 survey mile).Astin, V. et al.

Balfour had held the seat since a by- election in 1906, following his defeat at Manchester East in the 1906 general election. He had also been Prime Minister between 1902 and 1905.  Candidates  The Unionist Party selected as its candidate Edward Grenfell, who was a director of the Bank of England. Sir Vansittart Bowater, who had been Lord Mayor of London in 1913, stood as an Independent Unionist.  Results  Turnout was unsurprisingly low in the first contested election in the City since the first 1910 general election. Grenfell won the seat by a convincing margin.

While at Studio One, Marshall arranged several recordings by Burning Spear, and also provided backing vocals. Morris left Studio One in 1974, prompting Dodd to offer the chief engineer job to Marshall, but he declined the offer, unhappy with the wages. After leaving Studio One in 1974, he released the 1975 single \\"I Admire You\\", followed by an album of the same name. The dub version on the b-side of the single was one of the first to be credited to King Tubby. Marshall released several singles in the mid-1980s produced by Gussie Clarke, including remakes of \\"Throw Me Corn\\" and \\"I Admire You\\", and released further albums in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Generally, the strong lensing effect requires the projected lens mass density greater than the critical density, that is \\\\Sigma_{cr}\\\\,. For point-like background sources, there will be multiple images; for extended background emissions, there can be arcs or rings. Topologically, the multiple image production is governed by the odd number theorem. The strong lensing was predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and observationally discovered by Dennis Walsh, Bob Carswell, and Ray Weymann in 1979. They determined that the Twin Quasar Q0957+561A comprises two images of the same object. Observations Most strong gravitational lenses are detected by large-scale galaxy surveys. =Galaxy lensing= A light source passes behind a gravitational lens (point mass placed in the center of the image). The aqua circle is a source as it would be seen if there was no lens, white spots are the multiple images of the source. The foreground lens is a galaxy. When the background source is a quasar or unresolved jet, the strong lensed images are usually point-like multiple images; When the background source is a galaxy or extended jet emission, the strong lensed images can be arcs or rings. As of 2017, several hundred galaxy-galaxy (g-g) strong lenses have been observed. The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and Euclid surveys are expected to discover more than 100,000 such objects. =Cluster lensing= The foreground lens is a galaxy cluster. In this case, the lens is usually powerful enough to produce noticeable both strong lensing (multiple images, arcs or rings) and weak lensing effects (ellipticity distortions). Astrophysical applications =Mass profiles= Since gravitational lensing is an effect only depending on gravitational potential, it can be used to constrain the mass model of lenses. With the constraints from multiple images or arcs, a proposed mass model can be optimized to fit to the observables. The subgalactic structures currently interests lensing astronomers are the central mass distribution and dark matter halos. =Time delays= Since the light rays go through different paths to produce multiple images, they will get delayed by local potentials along the light paths. The time delay differences from different images can be determined by the mass model and the cosmological model. Thus, with observed time delays and constrained mass model, the cosmological constant like Hubble constant can be inferred.

He is considered one of the more successful songwriters of the 1960s as a result of his collaborations with John Carter. His biggest success was \\"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\\", which was a 1965 US number 1 hit single for Herman's Hermits. Life and career Lewis was born in Small Heath, Birmingham, England. While still at elementary school, Lewis met his future songwriting partner John Shakespeare. They formed a skiffle band in the 1950s called LVI, when they began writing songs together. In 1960 the duo went to London, and presented themselves under their songwriting pseudonyms John Carter and Ken Lewis. Terry Kennedy became their manager and convinced them to start their own band as an outlet for their songs. In 1961, the first single by Carter-Lewis and the Southerners was released, \\"Back on the Scene\\". The band were not successful, and their main claim to fame remains a brief stint that Jimmy Page did as their lead guitarist. The band also featured twice as \\"guests\\" on the Beatles' 1963 radio show Pop Goes The Beatles. In 1964 they met Perry Ford, who worked as an engineer in a small recording studio in Denmark Street, London. They noticed their voices blended well and started recording demos together, resulting in a single on Pye Records, \\"What More Do You Want\\" as the Ivy League. Their luck changed when Herman's Hermits recorded \\"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\\" and took it to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. In the UK it was a smaller hit for Goldie and the Gingerbreads. They then provided backing vocals on \\"I Can't Explain\\", by the Who. In 1965 and 1966, The Ivy League scored four UK chart hits, including \\"Tossing and Turning\\", which reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. Other songs were penned for Brenda Lee ‚Äì \\"Is It True?\\", the Music Explosion ‚Äì \\"Little Bit O' Soul\\", Dana Gillespie ‚Äì \\"Thank You Boy\\" and Peter and Gordon ‚Äì \\"Sunday for Tea\\". In early 1966 Carter decided he had enough of touring and was replaced by Tony Burrows from The Kestrels. In 1967, Lewis left the Ivy League and was replaced by Neil Landon. Lewis started writing and recording again with Carter. One of the first results was \\"Let's Go To San Francisco\\", released as by the Flower Pot Men. When the single became a hit, a band was put together to give the \\"band\\" faces, as both Carter and Lewis refused to tour again. The vocal quartet that mimed to the records included Tony Burrows and Neil Landon, leaving Perry Ford to carry on The Ivy League. In late 1967 Carter and Lewis formed Sunny Records as their production company. Starting in early 1968 the Carter/Lewis output became more confusing. Songs intended for the Flower Pot Men were released billed as by Friends, Haystack and Dawn Chorus, only to be re-released in this century as the Flower Pot Men. The \\"touring\\" Flower Pot Men started recording songs by Roger Greenaway and eventually changed their name to White Plains. After a minor success billed as Stamford Bridge (UK number 47 with \\"Chelsea\\"), Lewis decided to leave the music industry in 1971, suffering from depression. He went to live in Wallsend. Despite not being a driver, he travelled extensively during his earlier years, visiting most of Europe's capital cities as well as many other parts of the world. He was also briefly married in his early life. He spent much of the 1990s in a starter home in the Petersfield district of Cambridge, with few possessions other than a piano. He was a popular member of the local community, visiting the elderly, vulnerable and isolated. Many of his neighbours were unaware of either his musical past or of his connection to the nearby St Matthews Church, until he wrote an article for the locally delivered church magazine, alluding to his earlier life. At the end of that decade he moved briefly to a nearby retirement home, before leaving Cambridge to move to a nursing home in Staffordshire. Later he returned to Cambridge, where his sister currently resides, spending the remainder of his life at a nursing home in the Cherry Hinton district, where he succumbed to complications associated with type 1 diabetes, on 2 August 2015. His funeral took place in the East Chapel of Cambridge Crematorium on 20 August 2015. His former writing partner John Shakespeare (alias John Carter) was among those attending. \\"Let's Go to San Francisco\\" was played at the end of the ceremony. The funeral date coincided with that of 1960s contemporary, Cilla Black.

Paul Young or simply Paul Young, is a Canadian author. He wrote the novels The Shack, Cross Roads and Eve.  Early life  Young is the oldest of four, born May 11, 1955, in Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada, but the majority of his first decade was lived with his missionary parents in the highlands of Netherlands New Guinea (West Papua), among the Dani, a technologically stone age tribal people. These became his family and as the first white child and outsider who ever spoke their language, he was granted unusual access into their culture and community. When he was six he was sent to a boarding school.  Career  In an interview Young said he had written primarily as a way to create unique gifts for his friends, until his wife repeatedly urged him to write something for their six children in order to put down in one place his perspectives on God and on the inner healing Young had experienced as an adult. The resulting manuscript, that later became The Shack, was intended only for his six kids and for a handful of close friends. Young initially printed just 15 copies of his book. Two of his close friends encouraged him to have it published, and assisted with some editing and rewriting in order to prepare the manuscript for publication. After rejection by 26 publishers, Young and his friends published the book under the name of their newly created publishing company, Windblown Media, in 2007. The company spent only C$200 in advertising; word-of-mouth referrals eventually drove the book to number one on the New York Times trade paperback fiction best-seller list in June 2008.Aim at 'spiritually interested' sparks 'The Shack' sales USA Today, 2008-04-30 \\"The Shack\\" was the top-selling fiction and audio book of 2008 in America through November 30.

Olivine crystals represent about 37% of the weight of the meteorite. Pallasites are not common; they compose only 1.8% of all known meteorites. It has been proposed that pallasites represents the interface between the stone mantle and the metal core of differentiated asteroids. Strewn field Meteorites were found in a zone about long and wide crossed by the Dnieper River. The area was contaminated in 1986 during the Chernobyl disaster and falls now in the Periodic Control Zone.

She is Professor of Epidemiology, a Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford and has been the Head of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford and Cancer Research UK since 1989. Early life and education Valerie Beral was born in Australia on 28 July 1946. She completed her MBBS degree graduating with first-class honours from the University of Sydney in 1969.An Interview with Valerie Beral She then spent six months travelling the \\"hippie trail\\" through Asia of which she said \\"That taught me how much I wanted to work. But I still wanted to leave Australia.\\" She then travelled to England and successfully applied for a job at the Hammersmith Hospital. Career At Hammersmith Hospital, she worked under Charles Fletcher, who recognised that she was suited to epidemiology and so propelled her towards the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. There she completed a combined course in Epidemiology & Statistics in 1971‚Äì72 under the tutorship of Donald Reid. Beral felt very comfortable with the move because she had never felt happy in clinical medicine. She says that \\"she had never been able to understand how her peers could be so certain about making decisions on incomplete evidence. Epidemiology has offered her not an escape from that uncertainty, but the opportunity to tackle it head on.\\" She is a member of the Royal College of Physicians. One of Beral's first epidemiological interests was the combined oral contraceptive pill because of work she had previously done in family planning. Beral moved on to other projects but this is an area in which the data have yet to provide support for her initial instinct that the contraceptive pill, like pregnancy, will eventually be shown to protect against breast cancer. Later work included the effects of radiation, breast cancer trials and screening, AIDS, gene therapy, Hiroshima survivors, Chernobyl, food toxins, and much else. The British Medical Journal described her tally of jobs, publications, and committees as reading \\"like a checklist of the epidemiological causes c√©lebres of the past three decades\\". Beral completed her training in 1972 and began working for the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for a number of years. From there she moved to direct the Cancer Research UK Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford in 1989. Beral said of being offered the role: \\"One of the major deterrents when I was offered the ICRF job in 1989 was the thought of being so much in the public eye. It's not my nature.\\" Beral has served on various international committees for the World Health Organization and the United States National Academy of Sciences. She also chairs the Department of Health's Advisory Committee on Breast Cancer Screening. =Million Women Study= Beral was one of the leaders of the Million Women Study which was opened in 1997, and has recruited more than 1.3 million UK women over 50 via the NHS breast screening centres. The study is investigating how a woman's reproductive history can affect her health, with a particular focus on the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It is the largest such study in the world with one in four of UK women in the target age group participating. In August 2003, Beral's group published results showing that taking HRT increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer with an estimated 20,000 UK women aged 50‚Äì64 having possibly developed the disease between 1993 and 2003 due to HRT use. The study also showed that risk increases the longer a woman uses HRT, but drops to the normal level within five years after stopping use.

She also spends time in her house in north London, shared with her American husband, Paul Fine, who works at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She maintains close links with her native Australia but \\"could not imagine returning to live there\\". Aside from concerns that Australia would hold little for her partner, Beral has also joked that \\"The population's too small!\\" to satisfy her needs as an epidemiologist.

Much of the land of the Motte Rimrock Reserve was donated to the University of California in 1976 by Charles and Ottie Motte. Numerous parcels have been added since.  Ecology The Motte Rimrock Reserve contains large areas of open grassland, coastal sage scrub, willow riparian woodland, and rocky outcrops that support a diversity of plant and animal species. The reserve harbors a mixture of both coastal and inland species and owes its diversity to its location equidistant between the Pacific Ocean and the Mojave Desert. The reserve also possesses a rich cultural history including some recognized archeological sites. Current on-going research projects include studies on the population dynamics of small mammals, ant behavior, plant-insect interactions, and habitat restoration.  Wildlife  As the surrounding area experiences rapid urbanization, the reserve serves to protect a number of species threatened or endangered by development and habitat loss including Stephens' kangaroo rat, the California gnatcatcher, orange-throated whiptail, and Bell's Sparrow, as well as several diminishing plant communities such as riversidean sage scrub. The reserve is an active participant in the Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency (RCHCA) a joint powers authority created to protect and preserve the Stephens' kangaroo rat. The director of the reserve is Kenneth J. Halama, PhD, an ecologist and conservation biologist.

Thomas K. Lindsay is an American educator and academic who briefly served as President of Shimer College. He was the Deputy Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities until December 2008. He was also the Director of the NEH We the People initiative, which funds programs, research and other activities that explore significant events and themes in U.S. history and culture, and advance knowledge of the principles that define America. He serves as the Director of the Center for Higher Education at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank. Early academic career Lindsay received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. His research has focused largely on the relation of democracy and education. His articles have appeared in the American Political Science Review, The Journal of Politics and the American Journal of Political Science. Lindsay was a professor of Political Science at the University of Northern Iowa and won the Pi Sigma Alpha/American Political Science Association Award for Outstanding Teaching in 1999. The same year, he was appointed dean of the graduate school and director of the Institute for Philosophic Studies at the University of Dallas, and subsequently was promoted to provost. In 2005, Lindsay briefly became provost and executive vice president of Seton Hall University. Shimer College presidency Thomas Lindsay became president of Shimer College, a Great Books college with an enrollment of approximately 150 students, in January 2009. His short tenure was attributable to his controversial tactics and questionable long-term plans for the school. Controversy first broke out when Lindsay abruptly fired the Director of Admissions, subsequently replacing her with a candidate who had been twice rejected by the search committee. According to Shimer Professor Albert Fernandez, Lindsay's actions were undertaken unilaterally, \\"without any internal consultation whatsoever\\". He soon acquired the title, \\"The Enemy of Democracy at Shimer College\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Is_Democracy_Important_at_Shimer_College.pdf as reported in the Student Newspaper of the Illinois Institute of Technology (Shimer had relocated to the IIT Campus in 2006). In January 2010, it was first made public that most of the trustees supporting Lindsay's actions also shared financial ties with Barre Seid. Seid, a conservative Chicago industrialist and noted supporter of right wing causes, had previously made major donations to Shimer, albeit anonymously. In February 2010, despite the unanimous objections of the faculty, strong opposition from the community as a whole, and protests by students, the Board of Trustees approved a wholesale rewrite by Lindsay of the school's mission statement. The vote passed by a secret ballot vote of 18-16. In response, on April 14, the Shimer Assembly passed a Vote of No Confidence. Four days later, on April 18, 2010, the Shimer College Board of Trustees voted to remove Lindsay from his post as president. A majority voted to oust Lindsay, leaving a small contingent of Lindsay supporters on the Board, all of whom subsequently resigned. The vote came shortly after unanimous votes of no confidence by the faculty, the Alumni Association, and the Assembly. Later academic career In September 2011, Lindsay joined the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Austin, Texas, where he serves as the Director of the Center for Higher Education.

She was formerly the co-host of the morning sports show Get Up! along with Jalen Rose and Mike Greenberg, the co-host of SportsNation on ESPN2, and former host of Winners Bracket on ABC with Marcellus Wiley. Beadle has had various hosting jobs on different networks prior to joining ESPN in 2009, including College Sports Television and the YES Network. Life and career =Early life= Michelle Beadle was born in Italy to Bob Beadle, a former executive at Valero Energy, and Serenella Paladino, from Italy. She spent the first half of her childhood in Roanoke, Texas, outside Dallas, and the second half in Boerne, a small town outside San Antonio. She said that her mother was her best friend growing up because her mother did not speak English when she immigrated to America and they had to learn the language together. She was admittedly a tomboy growing up and had all male friends. She graduated from Boerne High School. Beadle attended the University of Texas at Austin for political science as a pre-law student. She later joined a law group, and worked at the capitol in Austin, which helped dissuade her from pursuing a legal career. After three years she decided against law and took three years off because she did not know what she wanted to do and her college credits were geared toward law school. She spent time in Canada working odd jobs and eventually returned to Austin and waited tables while trying to decide what to do with her life. Beadle also attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, graduating from the latter. =Early career= With her father's assistance, Beadle got her career start as an intern for the San Antonio Spurs and was later given a shot at being a reporter. She also started her career at Fox Sports Net hosting Big Game Hunters. In 2002, Beadle moved to TNN as a \\"behind-the-chutes\\" sideline reporter for the coverage of the Professional Bull Riders' (PBR) Bud Light Cup tour. She was originally meant to fill in for two weeks but was asked to stay full-time. While at TNN, she also served as a freelance reporter for CBS Sports on its coverage of the PBR and ESPN's Titan Games. Next, Beadle went to the Travel Channel and hosted the show Get Packing. She then hosted a show for Major League Baseball Production's magazine show Cathedrals of the Game. Beadle later worked for the YES Network where she conducted interviews and did feature reporting for YES' regular season, preseason, and postseason New Jersey Nets telecasts. She also served as a sideline reporter for Nets basketball games, was co-host of Kids on Deck and Sportslife NYC, and was the host of YES' Ultimate Road Trip. Additionally, Beadle hosted College Sports Television's The 1 College Sports Show, and pre and postgame sports shows. She was also the reporter for the NFL Films syndicated program NFL Under the Helmet. She also hosted several other entertainment-themed and reality-based shows, including People.com's feature, What You Missed Over the Weekend; Fine Living Network's I Want Your Job; Animal Planet's Animal Planet Report; Travel Channel's Beach Week series and Discovery Channel's Inside Orlando's Resorts, and Outrageous Room Service. She has also been a Red Carpet reporter for the Golden Globes, Grammy Awards, SAG Awards, and the Tony Awards, and contributed for People Magazine on television, appearing on The Today Show, The Early Show, Extra, Access Hollywood, and Entertainment Tonight. =Career at ESPN= Beadle joined ESPN on June 1, 2009, as co-host with Colin Cowherd of SportsNation, which premiered on ESPN2 on July 6, 2009. Beadle was one of the last people out of 142 to audition for SportsNation. ESPN called her back and asked her to write about what she would do to make the show better. Thinking it was a joke, she wrote \\"a sarcastic list of 10 stupid things,\\" which helped her land the job. Prior to co-hosting SportsNation, during her time at TNN, Beadle also worked freelance as a reporter for ESPN's Titan Games. She also was the New York SportsCenter anchor for ESPN Radio's The Michael Kay Show on 1050 ESPN New York. She was later named the co-host of Winners Bracket along with Marcellus Wiley. The show, which was part of ESPN Sports Saturday, a two- hour block of sports programming on ABC, premiered on April 3, 2010. She also hosted a weekly Podcast, \\"The Michelle Beadle Podcast\\", and has also served as a guest host on Mike and Mike in the Morning. =Career at NBC= On May 22, 2012, it was announced that she was leaving ESPN for the family of NBC networks, primarily as host on NBC Sports Network as well as correspondent on Access Hollywood. She anchored NBC Sports Network's daily morning studio coverage of the 2012 London Olympics. The Crossover with Beadle and Briggs debuted on January 28, 2013 on the NBC Sports Network. The show featured Beadle and Dave Briggs, formerly of Fox News Channel and CSN New England. NBC described the show as one that focuses on sports, pop culture and entertainment. In May 2013, the show was rebranded as The Crossover with Michelle Beadle, with Beadle as the sole host. On September 25, 2013, The Crossover with Michelle Beadle was cancelled. =Return to ESPN= Beadle returned to ESPN on March 3, 2014, appearing as a co-host on SportsNation. She was released from her NBC contract early as part of a deal between the two media companies that included Ryder Cup coverage and Olympics highlights rights. In July 2014, she criticized ESPN colleague Stephen A. Smith on social media for comments he made about the Ray Rice domestic abuse case. The furor led to a week-long suspension of Smith. She had another heated social media dialog on the same matter with MTV celebrity Christopher Boykin. In September 2014, she joined Grantland, a subsidiary of ESPN, hosting a podcast called Beadlemania. Beadle began hosting NBA Countdown in 2016. In April 2018, she also began co-hosting a morning sports show on ESPN called Get Up! along with Jalen Rose and Mike Greenberg. In August of the same year, ESPN announced that Beadle would be leaving Get Up! by the end of the month, and instead focus her efforts on NBA coverage.. In the summer of 2019, ESPN quietly removed Beadle from NBA Countdown, replacing her with Rachel Nichols and Maria Taylor, respectively. Beadle then proceeded to enter a buyout with ESPN, which will effectively end her time at the company. =HBO - The Fight Game= As of March 2015, Beadle had interviewed Manny Pacquiao on HBO's \\"The Fight Game\\" regarding the 2015 fight with Floyd Mayweather. Personal life Beadle is an avid dog lover, as well as being a fan of professional wrestling, the Houston Astros, and the San Antonio Spurs. She has two siblings: a younger brother, Robert, and a younger sister.

According to Ross, it is not clear if the pronoun similarities between the four remaining branches of Central and South New Guinea are retentions for proto-TNG forms or shared innovations defining a single branch of TNG. Voorhoeve argues independently for an Awyu‚ÄìOk relationship, and Foley echoes that Asmat may be closest to Awyu and Ok of the TNG languages. Regardless, the four individual branches of reduced Central and South New Guinea are themselves clearly valid families. * Central and South New Guinea (Asmat‚ÄìOk) ** Asmat‚ÄìKamoro family [a recent expansion along the south coast] ** Greater Awyu family ** Mombum family ** Ok‚ÄìOksapmin family Ethnologue (2009) retains only Awyu‚ÄìDumut and Ok, calling the branch Ok‚ÄìAwyu, and places Asmat and Mombum as independent branches of TNG.

The Somahai languages and the recently discovered Bayono-Awbono may also belong here, but there is little data to go on. History In the mid 1960s, Alan Healey, a colleague of Laycock, noted connections between the Ok, Asmat, and Awyu‚ÄìDumut families. Voorhoeve (1968) expanded on this and coined the name CSNG; his proposal added Trans-Fly and Marind to the mix. Collaboration with McElhanon and his Finisterre‚ÄìHuon family in 1970 found a connection between them, which was named Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea. Wurm's 1975 expansion of TNG also expanded CSNG, with the addition of Awin‚ÄìPa, Bosavi, Duna‚ÄìPogaya, East Strickland, Mombum, and Momuna. Ross's recension in 2005 retained nothing from Voorhoeve and only Mombum from Wurm, though the Momuna languages were too sparsely attested for him to classify.

The subfamilies are at best only distantly related. The best described Pauwasi language is Karkar, across the border in Papua New Guinea. They are spoken around the headwaters of the Pauwasi River in the Indonesian- PNG border region. Based on earlier work, the East and West Pauwasi languages of Indonesia were classified together in Wurm (1975), though he (and later researchers) did not recognize that Yuri (Karkar) of Papua New Guinea was also East Pauwasi. That connection was made by Usher, though anthropologists had long known of the connection. Later the South Pauwasi languages were also identified by Usher, and the West Pauwasi family tentatively expanded.New Guinea World Wichmann (2013), Foley (2018) and Pawley & Hammarstr√∂m (2018), noting the sharp differences between the three groups, are agnostic about whether West Pauwasi, East Pauwasi and South Pauwasi are related.Wichmann, S√∏ren. 2013.

Molof (Poule) The inclusion of Molof (Poule) is especially tentative (as of 2020).NewGuineaWorld, Poule The languages are not close: though the Eastern languages are clearly related, Yafi and Emumu are only 25% lexically similar. Pawley and Hammarstr√∂m (2018) also question whether Eastern Pauwasi and Western Pauwasi are really related. They also note that Tebi and Towei are very different from each other, and may not necessarily group with each other. Karkar-Yuri, long thought to be an isolate in Papua New Guinea, is clearly related and may actually form a dialect continuum with Emumu in Indonesia. On the other hand, the Western languages are so poorly attested that it is not certain that they are part of the Pauwasi family (or even related to each other), or if the common words are loans and they constitute a separate family or families, though a family connection appears likely.Harald Hammarstr√∂m, 2010.

Dubu no and Yafi nam might reflect pTNG *na, and Towei ngo pTNG *ga (*nga), and the plural pTNG *nu and *ni. Classification Stephen Wurm (1975) classified the Western (Indonesian) languages as a branch of the Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea (TNG) phylum, a position which Malcolm Ross (2005) tentatively retained. Ross's TNG classification is based on personal pronouns. Since no pronouns could be reconstructed from the available data on the poorly attested Indonesian Pauwasi languages, which were all that were recognized as Pauwasi at the time, only a tentative assessment could be made, based on a few lexical items. Some of the pronouns of Dubu and Yafi look like they might be TNG. However, Ross counted Karkar, for which the pronouns were known, as an isolate because its pronouns did not pattern as TNG. At this stage its identity as a Pauwasi language was unknown. Pawley and Hammarstr√∂m (2018) do not consider there to be sufficient evidence for the Pauwasi languages to be classified as part of Trans-New Guinea, though they do note the following lexical resemblances between Tebi, Yafi, and proto-Trans-New Guinea. *Tebi ne ‚Äòeat‚Äô < *na- *Tebi mi, Yafi yemar ‚Äòlouse‚Äô < *iman, *niman Foley (2018) notes that Western Pauwasi has more Trans-New Guinea lexical similarities than East Pauwasi does. He notes that Karkar-Yuri shares some typological similarities with the Trans-New Guinea languages, which could be due to chance, contact, or genetic inheritance.

Kaki Ae (Tate) * Eleman family **West: Keuru, Opao, Orokolo **East: Toaripi, Tairuma (Uaripi) Purari was included by Brown (1968), but the only evidence is the 1sg pronoun nai, which might simply be a reflection of TNG *na. The purported evidence for including Eleman in the Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea family lies in Kaki Ae. Franklin (1995) shows regular sound correspondences between Kaki Ae and Eleman, including Kaki Ae n to Eleman *r, so Kaki Ae nao 1sg appears to be cognate with Eleman *ara, both perhaps descending from proto-TNG *na. Likewise, Kaki Ae nu'u may reflect pTNG *nu, and the forms of the 2sg pronouns, ao and *a, are common in TNG languages. Ross states that the Kaki Ae isolate links Eleman proper within TNG. However, Glottolog notes that the sound correspondences are just what would expect from loans, given the different phonologies of the languages: Eleman has no n/l/r distinction, and Kaki Ae has no t/k distinction. Pawley and Hammarstr√∂m (2018) classify Kaki Ae as a language isolate rather than as part of Eleman, noting that similarities with Eleman are mostly because of borrowing.

The valley is notable for its karst formations, which have been designated a National Natural Landmark. Grassy Cove is also home to a small unincorporated community. Grassy Cove is located atop the Cumberland Plateau, approximately east of Crossville and west of the plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment. The mountains that surround the cove are part of the southern fringe of the Cumberland Mountains. The cove is geologically related to the Sequatchie Valley, a large narrow valley stretching just opposite the mountains to the south. Tennessee State Route 68 passes through the northern part of Grassy Cove, providing the valley's only major road access. Geology Sandstone caprock cliff near the summit of Black Mountain Grassy Cove is walled in by Brady Mountain to the west, Bear Den Mountain on the east, and Black Mountain to the north. Brady and Bear Den both converge in a V-shaped formation to enclose the cove to the south. Just beyond this convergence, Hinch Mountain-- the highest point in Cumberland County-- rises to . The southern slopes of Hinch descend drastically to the Sequatchie Valley. The elevation of Grassy Cove is just over , whereas the elevation of the Sequatchie Valley is roughly . Grassy Cove, viewed from Brady Mountain Both the Sequatchie Valley and Grassy Cove were part of an anticline that formed as rock strata were bent upward by thrust faulting to form a large ridge during the Paleozoic era (appx. 250 million years ago). During the Mesozoic era, continued erosion along this ridge exposed its younger, more soluble Mississippian aged limestone layers. Over subsequent millennia, the limestone dissolved, forming a series of sinkholes that eventually coalesced to create the Sequatchie Valley. Grassy Cove is one such sinkhole that has yet to coalesce with the rest of the Sequatchie Valley.Harry Moore, A Geologic Trip Across Tennessee by Interstate 40 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 69-70. Grassy Cove is drained entirely by underground streams. The valley's main stream, Grassy Cove Creek, flows northward across the cove before dropping into Mill Cave on the slopes of Brady Mountain. Dye traces indicate that it flows south through a series of caves before reemerging at the head of the Sequatchie Valley at Devilstep Hollow Cave, where it forms the headwaters of the Sequatchie River.Moore, 237.

Originally compiled by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Project Administration as Tennessee: A Guide to the State, and published in 1939. Also, early 19th-century settlers reportedly found the cove bottom cleared and containing only high grass upon their arrival.Helen Bullard and Joseph Krechniak, Cumberland County's First Hundred Years (Crossville, Tenn.: Centennial Committee, 1956), 126. Hence the name: Grassy Cove. The first Euro-American settlers arrived in Grassy Cove in 1801. This early caravan consisted primarily of families from Fluvanna County, Virginia. In 1803, they completed a log church and formed the Grassy Cove United Methodist Church, one of the first congregations in the Cumberland Plateau region. Prominent early settlers included John Ford, the community's founder, and Weatherston Greer, who arrived circa 1830. Greer set up the first post office in the cove, operated a sawmill and gristmill, and owned large tracts of land in the cove until the Civil War. Kemmer's descendants own much of the land in Grassy Cove today.Bullard and Krechniak, 126-129. During both the War of 1812 and the Civil War, Grassy Cove's caves were an invaluable source of saltpeter, which was used in the manufacture of gunpowder. William Kelly mined saltpeter in Grassy cove Saltpeter Cave in 1812, according to a manuscript written by Richard Green Waterhouse. According to a local legend, the body of a Confederate soldier (in full uniform) was found in a petrified state in one of the caves shortly after the war. When no one claimed the body, it was buried in the Grassy Cove Methodist Cemetery. Several residents claimed to have seen the soldier's ghost in the church, however, and when church attendance began to drop as a result, the soldier's body was disinterred and reburied in an undisclosed location.Bullard and Krechniak, 128-129.Information obtained from plaque entitled \\"Legend of Grassy Cove's Petrified Soldier\\" at the Grassy Cove Community Center, 29 March 2008. Cumberland Trail In 1998, the state of Tennessee established the Justin P. Wilson Cumberland Trail State Park, a linear park that will eventually encompass the Cumberland Trail (the trail is still currently under construction). The trail now includes the \\"Grassy Cove Segment\\" that traverses the crests of Black Mountain and Brady Mountain.

He at first wanted to be a violinist, but gave it up after twenty years when he compared a recording of his playing with that of Yehudi Menuhin. However, his musical training has been a major influence on his painting and sculpture, reproducing movement and harmony as Nierman sees similarities between the two disciplines. Nierman has had exhibitions in Mexico and abroad and over sixty recognitions of his work, half of which are from outside Mexico. His work is abstract but still with discernible images from nature such as birds, water, lightning and more. His paintings are in pure colors while his sculptures are generally of metal, often silver-toned. Life √Ångeles testigos de la Beatificaci√≥n de Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, a sculpture commemorating the beatification of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, in the city of Puebla, Mexico. Leonardo Nierman Mendelejis was born in Mexico City on November 1, 1932. He is the only child of Lithuanian Jewish parents Clara Mendelejis, a bakery worker and Chanel Nierman, a bus inspector who later started a small jacket factory. Nierman's parents arrived to Mexico in the mid 1920s, his father from Lithuania and his mother from the Ukraine, both poor. The two met in Mexico. When he was a child, he wanted to be a musician and dedicated himself to the violin for two decades. At that time, art did not attract him although he remembers seeing the murals of Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco but with little reaction except anger upon seeing some vandalism on an Orozco mural. To pursue music, he began with private violin lesson and attended the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico for a while. He even gave some recitals in the Palacio de Bellas Artes. He gave up the violin when he heard a recording of himself playing Symphonie espagnole by √âdouard Lalo, and then comparing his interpretation with that of Yehudi Menuhin. At first he thought he had wasted his time with the violin but has since decided that it gave him his philosophy on life and prepared him for his painting and sculpture. After he left music, he began to be attracted to color, but he remains attached to music especially artists such as Bach, Debussy, Mahler and Stravinsky. However, he was still hesitant about painting. He remembers that one day he was walking in the historic center of Mexico City and found an artist's supply shop and thought about taking up painting as a hobby, but then thought he could not because of lack of preparation. Despite his affinity for the arts, Nierman's formal education was not in this field. He graduated from preparatory in 1951, with a concentration in physics and mathematics. In 1953, he studied the psychology of color and form in static and moving bodies. He also began spending large amounts of time in museums. He completed a bachelor's in business administration at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico but never pursued this career because he had begun to paint, including a mural at his school. He began painting on his own in his bedroom in his parents‚Äô home. He never thought he would become professional but little by little the activity began to consume most of his time, becoming a self-taught artist. Career He began his career painting when he convinced the dean of the business school where he was a student, to paint a mural at the department's auditorium in 1956. To paint the mural, he made an appointment with David Alfaro Siqueiros to ask for advice, receiving such especially the mixing of colors. The mural was later destroyed when the wall was taken down. Nierman had been painting for a while when Raquel Tibol invited him to exhibit his work at the Centro de Deportes Israeli in Mexico City. He told himself that if he did not sell a single painting, he would quit. Two paintings were purchased and were then seen by the owner of IFA Gallery in Washington, DC. Since 1959, this gallery has exhibited Nierman's work and opened doors for him internationally. Since then, he has had over 100 exhibitions in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. More recent exhibitions include the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Coahuila in 2000, the International Museum of Art & Science in Mcallen, Texas in 2009, the MACAY museum in M√©rida in 2012, the Francisco Coss√≠o Museum in San Luis Potos√≠ in 2012, and the art gallery of the Complejo Cultural Universitario in the city of Puebla in 2012. His work can be found in museums and public buildings in Australia, Austria, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States, Spain, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Monaco, Panama, Sweden and Thailand . These include the gallery of the Vatican, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City, the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, The Art Modern Gallery of New York and Phoenix Art Museum . His monumental works can be found in many of Mexico's major cities and abroad. In 1969 he painted a mural for the physics department at Princeton as well as designed the stained glass windows for Temple Beth Israel in Lomas de Chapultepec . His metal sculptures appear in places such as universities, concert halls, research centers, libraries, cultural centers, atriums and parks in countries such as Canada, the United States, Ecuador and Lithuania . These include the Flame of the Millennium which is at the Ohio Street interchange of the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago, Eternal Light at the Outpatient Care Center of the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago and Sensaci√≥n de Vuelo at the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport . In 1997 he created a limited edition postage stamp for the Mexican postal service . He has received over sixty recognitions, half of them from outside Mexico. Recognitions including Honorific Mention at UNAM (1960), member of the Instituto de Artes in Mexico (1964), lifetime member of the Royal Society of the Arts in London (1965), Palme d'Or des Beaux Arts from Monaco (1969), Royce Medal (New York, 1970), League of Art Gold Medal (Chicago, 1980), Golden Centaur and honorary master's of painting from the Academy of Italy (1982), named European Academic by the Centro Studi Di Recerch L Accademia D Europa in Italy (1984) and the winner of the sculpture competition at the University of Central Florida (1988). In 1993, he became a patron of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields in London. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University in Irvine, California . The city of Chicago named December 19 in his honor in 2002. In 2003 he received the Gloria Award from the International Latino Cultural Center in Chicago. In 2010 he received the Vasco de Quiroga Medal from the Mexico City government. UNAM named a classroom designed for cultural activities after the painter in 2011. Artistry His artistic production includes painting, tapestry design, sculpture, murals, engraving and glass work. His first artwork was done in the 1950s, influenced by the work of Kandinsky, Klee, Mir√≥ and Chirico, as well as the abstract, cubist and surrealist movements. However, much of his later work has been shaped by his interpretation of nature and a search for the relationship between abstract art and the cosmos, spurred by his studies of color and movement in the 1950s. The other major influence has been his musical background. He stated that music and painting are very much alike ‚Äî both have tonalities, rhythms, high-intensity areas and resting areas. He has been called the Jackson Pollock of Latin American art. His work has been classified as ‚Äúmagical expressionism.‚Äù He paints abstract forms with movement and rhythm using bright colors. His work is not narrative. He describes his work as an interaction of colors which create a moment. While abstract, elements of nature are present in his works with elements such as wind, water, lightning, fire and volcanic eruptions. In his painting, he prefers to work with clean pigments as the mixing of colors tend to dull the effect of light. When he paints, he says it is like going crazy. He does not know at that time if the work is good or not only that it makes him feel. It is not conscious or planned. Nierman has said: Painting is to me the aperture through which it is possible to enter a certain world; in it the viewer may find an endless number of magic images, objects, remembrances, associations, fears, joys, hopes and dreams. His sculpture work has been made of marble, silver, gold, bronze and stainless steel, but it is usually silver-toned. These often contain elements such as birds, angels, archangels, winged victories, flames, and musical instruments. His metal sculptures evoke movement and harmony usually through the use of spirals.

Though they were very close to each other, Paul Grimault and Jean-Fran√ßois Laguionie rarely worked together (though Grimault produced Laguionie's first three shorts). Jean-Fran√ßois Laguionie then directed several short films, climaxing with the now famous La Travers√©e de l'Atlantique √† la rame (Rowing across the Atlantic) (1978), which won the C√©sar Award for best short animated film in 1979. He has also been a friend of Michel Ocelot, whose short film Les Trois inventeurs was shot in Laguionie's home studio and used the magnet-aided method of cutout animation invented by him.

They were classified as a branch of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea by Stephen Wurm, followed by Malcolm Ross. William A. Foley concurs that it is \\"highly likely\\" that the Madang languages are part of TNG, although the pronouns, the usual basis for classification in TNG, have been \\"replaced\\" in Madang. Timothy Usher finds that Madang is closest to the Upper Yuat River languages and other families to its west, but does not for now address whether this larger group forms part of the TNG family.Madang The family is named after Madang Province and the Adelbert Range. History Sidney Herbert Ray identified the Rai Coast family in 1919. In 1951 these were linked with the Mabuso languages by Arthur Capell to create his Madang family. John Z'graggen (1971, 1975) expanded Madang to languages of the Adelbert Range and renamed the family Madang‚ÄìAdelbert Range, and Wurm (1975)Ethnologue (15th edition) adopted this as a branch of his Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea phylum. For the most part, Ross's (2005) Madang family includes the same languages as Z'graggen Madang‚ÄìAdelbert Range, but the internal classification is different in several respects, such as the dissolution of the Brahman branch. Internal classification The languages are as follows: * ? Yamben * Bargam (Mugil) *Central Madang ** Croisilles (reduced, incl. Northern Adelbert Range) ** Mabuso ** Mindjim ** Rai Coast (reduced, South Madang) *West Madang ** Southern Adelbert Range (Ramu Tributaries) ** Kalam (West Madang Highlands) *East Madang **Wasembo **Yaganon Yamben has been added as a probable primary branch of Madang by Andrew Pick (2019). The time depth of Madang is comparable to that of Austronesian or Indo-European. Pronouns Ross (2000) reconstructed the pronouns as follows: :{ ! !!sg!!pl - !1 *ya*iactually i ~ si - !2 *na*ni, *ta - !3 *nu } These are not the common TNG pronouns. However, Ross postulates that the TNG dual suffixes *-le and *-t remain, and suggests that the TNG pronouns live on as Kalam verbal suffixes.

Peck received her arts education from the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts and was employed as a magazine illustrator from 1906 to 1940. Peck's body of work encompasses a wide range, from popular women's magazines and children's books, works of fiction, commercial art for products like Ivory soap, and comic books and watercolor painting later in her career. Peck worked during the \\"Golden Age of American Illustration\\" (1880s‚Äì1930s) contemporaneous with noted female illustrators Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green and Violet Oakley. Peck's work appeared in exhibitions from the Art Institute of Chicago to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and she received awards from the New York Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s. Peck resided in an art colony in Leonia, New Jersey with her collaborator and husband, artist John Scott Williams. In the 1940s, Peck contributed to Catholic comic books distributed to parochial schools. She focused on watercolor painting in the 1950s and her work was exhibited in Europe and the United States. Her most notable illustrations and artwork were published in three books early in her career: Shakespeare's Sweetheart (1905), A Lady of King Arthur's Court (1907), and In the Border Country (1909). Early life Clara Elsene Peck was born in Allegan, Michigan on April 18, 1883. Peck spent her youth in St. Paul, Minnesota and later studied art at the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts. She took classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine ArtsBy the 1880s, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts had developed a significant female student body. Artists such as Cecilia Beaux were on the teaching faculty during this period. Beaux taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts between 1895 and 1915.

He also founded the Shinnecock Summer School of Art (1891) at his summer home near Southampton, Long Island, and the Chase School of Art in New York City (1896) which became the New York School of Art in 1898. He also taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1896‚Äì1909). Notable pupils included Patrick Henry Bruce, Charles Webster Hawthorne, Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Sheeler, and Martha Walter. See: Reminiscing about her early years, Peck said: \\"With me the desire to become an artist has been strong since childhood. Other members of the family in previous generations were artists, making the love and joy in creative expression a natural one to me.\\" Marriage and later life A collaborative illustration with John Scott Williams In 1906, Peck married British-born illustrator John Scott Williams (1877‚Äì1976), and they produced two children together, Aynard and Conway. Peck and Williams shared similar styles, leading the two to occasionally collaborate on illustrations together. These works were signed with the first initials of their last names, \\"P W\\".See: Today's Housewife, December 1917 Some of Peck's works are also credited as Clara Elsene Williams and the press sometimes referred to her as \\"Mrs. John Scott Williams\\". After illustrator Harvey Dunn founded the Leonia School of Illustration in Leonia, New Jersey in 1915, Mattingly outlines the value of the Leonia art colony centered around Dunn as an important continuation of Howard Pyle's Brandywine school and the emergence of the Leonia community as a significant suburban social and cultural influence. Peck and Williams moved to an artist colony in Leonia, joining a group of about 90 professional artists. They lived in a house originally built by artist Charles Harry Eaton (American, 1850‚Äì1901) on Crescent AvenueMattingly, Suburban Landscapes, p. 315 and were neighbors with artist-couple John Rutherford Boyd (1882‚Äì1951) and Harriet Repplier Boyd. The Boyds' house became a community center of artistic gatherings where many of Leonia's artists exhibited their works.Mattingly, Suburban Landscapes, p. 222 The marriage between Peck and Williams came to an end, and J. Scott Williams remarried in 1930. Peck later resided in Brooklyn, New York and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Towards the end of her life, art historian Helen Teri Caro located Peck and acquired over 100 pieces of her artwork on behalf of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta. Peck died in Gettysburg in February 1968. Career =Illustration= Peck's career in illustration began in the early 1900s with her work for publisher George W. Jacobs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was a period when technological innovations in halftone and color printing engendered the \\"Golden Age of Illustration\\".Reed, The Illustrator in America: 1860‚Äì2000, p. 111Developments in halftone and color printing allowed leading artists such as Howard Pyle and Edwin Austin Abbey to showcase their abilities in a burgeoning field of illustrated magazines such a Harper's, Scribner's, McClure's, The Century, as well as the Saturday Evening Post and Collier's. In addition to illustrations, Peck created decorations and lettering designs for books. Notable works from this period include illustrations for Sara Hawks Sterling's Shakespeare's Sweetheart (1905) and A Lady of King Arthur's Court (1907), and Josephine Daskam Bacon's In the Border Country (1909). Peck eventually illustrated at least four additional books by Bacon.See The Luck o Lady Joan: a fairy tale for women, Chicago: F G Brown & co., 1913; The Girl at the Window, New York: Appleton-Century Company, 1934; The Room on the Roof, A Mystery Novel for Girls.

New York: Harper & Brothers, 1925 Women and children in Peck's work were depicted with great sensitivity in a wide variety of roles and responsibilities. Art historian and illustrator Walt Reed describes Peck's style as \\"decorative in composition and sensitive in rendering\\". Artistic themes found in Peck's work include education, child psychology, and the expectant mother. The decorative style of the period was popularized by seminal American illustrator Howard Pyle and his female students. \\"For many years, women illustrators dominated the fantasy and fairy tale fields as well as the school reading textbooks.\\"Reed, The Illustrator in America: 1860‚Äì2000, p. 87 According to Elizabeth H. Hawkes, curator emeritus of the Delaware Art Museum, the style consisted of \\"using flat, brightly colored figures boldly outlined and placed against a patterned background. They incorporated elements of the popular 1890s poster style and borrowed motifs from Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway, and the English Arts and Crafts movement style of illustration.\\" Peck's career in illustration was active from the \\"Golden Age of American Illustration\\" through the onset of the Great Depression when the careers of illustrators suffered due to the poor economy.Reed, The Illustrator in America: 1860‚Äì2000, p. 163 The output of magazine illustrations from Peck continued until at least 1935.As an example of her work during this period, see: The Household Magazine, Vol. 35, #12, December 1935 =Cartooning= \\"Waiting Winter Storage\\", oil/canvasboard, (c. 1950) In the 1940s, Peck worked as a cartoonist for Topix Comics and Treasure Chest, a series of Catholic-themed comic books. Topix Comics was launched in 1942 and produced in St. Paul, Minnesota. The comic book featured stories of courageous Christians, Saints, and Biblical narratives, and by 1946, it had a circulation of over 600,000. Peck's work was distributed exclusively in parochial schools and appeared throughout most of the title's nine-year run. She also provided material for early issues of the similarly themed Treasure Chest title, including a few episodes of \\"The Robinson's Rumpus Room\\" feature and the cover for Volume 2, Number 9 in 1946.http://comics.lib.msu.edu/rri/prri/peb.htm =Painting= Peck participated in several exhibitions in the 1950s, beginning with the American Watercolor Society. From 1956 to 1957, Peck was part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's European traveling exhibition; In 1958, Peck's work appeared at the Washington County Museum of Art, in a solo exhibition at Gettysburg College, at the York Art Center, and in New Canaan, Connecticut. The Brandywine River Museum and the Delaware Art Museum host her paintings.; Since 2000, a few landscape and portrait oil paintings sales have been recorded at various auction houses. Awards and distinctions Peck was a member of several art associations, including the American Watercolor Society (1931‚Äì1967), the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, National Association of Women Artists, the New York Watercolor Society and the Society of Illustrators. Along with Florence Scovel Shinn, Rose O'Neill and others, Peck was one of the first 20 women to become a member of the Society of Illustrators by 1922, representing about 10% of the total membership. In 1913, Peck's work was featured in exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and at the National Association of Women Artists and the New York Association of Women Painters and Sculptors where she won awards in 1920 and 1921. Posthumously, Peck's works were featured in the seminal 1976 New York exhibition, 200 Years of American Illustration;Pitz, 200 Years of American Illustration, pp. 12‚Äì13 In 1985 at the America's Great Women Illustrators 1850‚Äì1950 exhibition in New York; And, in 1986, at the American Illustration 1890‚Äì1925 exhibition held in Calgary.

The overall approach conceptualizes humans as active agents responding to and within richly complex social contexts. It is informed by social justice, and human rights. This approach leaves behind the radical, intra-psychic focus on the individual in isolation that is so common in psychology and psychotherapy. The therapeutic approach is a relatively new psychotherapeutic approach for responding to people who are experiencing difficulties of any sort (e.g., marriage, grief, victimization, perpetration of violence, etc.). The approach was developed in the 1990s by Allan Wade with some contributions by Nick Todd and Linda Coates. The approach involves analyzing social interaction, social context, social responses, and how the individual is responding to and making sense of this complexly rich psycho-social situation. The approach has been found to be extremely useful in working with victims and perpetrators of violence. Allan Wade is an expert in social interaction and this background allowed them to analyze what victims and perpetrator's actually do rather than accept wide- spread myths about what they are thought to do. Wade articulated the difference between mutual and unilateral acts and that violent acts are frequently misrepresented as mutual. In keeping with this, victim's are falsely understood as passive recipients of violence whereas they actually actively resist it (c.f., \\"Small Acts of Living: Everyday Resistance to Violence and Other Forms of Oppression\\".; Coates & Wade, 2004 Discourse and Society). However, after decades of practice and research, it has been shown that whenever people are mistreated, they resist. The approach uses a client- based encompassing definition of resistance to allow for the fact that victims resist mentally, spiritually, physically, and psychologically. Resistance includes: > \\"Any mental or behavioural act through which a person attempts to expose, > withstand, repel, stop, prevent, abstain from, strive against, impede, > refuse to comply with, or oppose any form of violence or oppression > (including any type of disrespect), or the conditions that make such acts > possible, may be understood as a form of resistance. Resistance is > prudent‚Äîvictims correctly anticipate that resistance will be met with > escalated violence and abuse and so they tend to resist covertly. This approach has been increasingly picked up around the world. The Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter website for example states: > \\"Whenever people are abused, they do many things to oppose the abuse and to > keep their dignity and their self-respect. This is called resistance. The > resistance might include not doing what the perpetrator wants them to do, > standing up against, and trying to stop or prevent violence, disrespect, or > oppression. Imagining a better life may also be a way that victims resist > abuse.\\" (Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter, 2007, p. 5). In traditional therapies, professionals (and others) tend to focus on what the victim \\"didn't do\\" and blame the victims for being \\"passive\\" or failing to take certain actions (For example, not screaming for help). These approaches fail to take into account the details of the social context that factored into the victim's actual response. For example, a woman may be criticized for not crying out for help but when asked she explains she did not cry out for help because she wanted to protect children from witnessing the attack upon her. In response-based practice, the client is viewed as an \\"agent\\" who has the capability to respond to an act, and is acting in a social context. RBP focus on what the victim actually did. Example: the response-based therapist would not ask a victim \\"How did that make you feel?\\", but instead would ask \\"When [act of violence] was done to you, how did you respond? What did you do?\\"  References   Related reading  * Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter. (2007).

Champlain. It is one of several lights on the lake which were reactivated in their original structures early in the 21st century. History This light, together with the Windmill Point Light, forms something of a range marking the center of the channel in this section of the lake. A light was placed here as early as 1829; some sources state it was initially a lantern simply hung in a tree, but all agree that it was soon hung in an upper story window of a stone house (still standing today). In 1856 the Lighthouse Board purchased a small plot and erected a stone pyramid on it, with a lantern placed at its peak. This light was first lit in 1857 and was tended by a local farmer rather than by a dedicated keeper. The farmer lived at some distance from the light, and there were constant problems with the lamp being extinguished on stormy nights. After requests through the first part of the decade, a permanent light station was established, with a round cast iron tower and a wooden keeper's house. This tower was of the same design as used in a number of smaller lights in the area, and its sixth-order Fresnel lens was lighted for the first time in 1881. Like many other Lake Champlain lights, it was supplanted in the 1930s by a separate skeleton tower with an acetylene beacon. As was also typically the case, however, the tower and keeper's house passed into private hands. Ironically, the cost-saving measure proved to be a maintenance drain in later years; by the turn of the century, the steel towers erected in the 1930s were in need of substantial repair or replacement. By this time the old light belonged to members of the Clark family, which also owned the Windmill Point Light. As with the latter, discussion with the Coast Guard led to placement of a new solar-powered beacon in the old tower in 2002. The tower was at one time painted red, but it has faded to a distinctive salmon pink color (sometime called \\"Nantucket red\\").

The museum is served by the Rambuteau Paris M√©tro station. Exhibits focus on the relationships between humans and the natural environment through the traditions and practices of hunting. The museum has been characterized by the Smithsonian magazine as ‚Äúone of the most rewarding and inventive in Paris\\", and is described in tourist guidebooks and other media as \\"quirky, astonishing, strange and eclectic\\". Origins Philip the Handsome (1478-1506), Duke of Burgundy, holding a hooded falcon, displayed in the Falconry Room The museum was founded in 1964 by wealthy French industrialist rugmaker Fran√ßois Sommer (1904-1973) and his wife Jacqueline, who were avid hunters and conservationists. It is operated by the Fondation de la Maison de la Chasse et de la Nature, which the couple also founded. The museum is housed within the H√¥tel de Gu√©n√©gaud (1651-1655), the only private mansion designed by architect Fran√ßois Mansart that still exists. Since 2002, it is also housed in the H√¥tel de Mongelas (1703), as well. It opened in 1967 and was thoroughly renovated in 2007. Overview Le Souillot, the talking boar head displayed in the Trophy Room The museum, housed in the limestone H√¥tel de Gu√©n√©gaud under a 99-year lease, is made up of multiple rooms paneled in wood and outfitted with bronze decorative fixtures designed by Brazilian sculptor Saint Clair Cemin, and made to look like vines, antlers and tree branches. The ceiling of one room has been covered in owl feathers in a work called The Night of Diana by contemporary Belgian artist Jan Fabre, previously known for decorating the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels with more than a million and a half beetle wing cases. The museum's rooms have names such as Room of the Boar, Salon of the Dogs and Cabinet of the Wolf. The museum's chief curator is Claude d'Anthenaise. The collection is partly made up of objects and works that were gathered personally by Fran√ßois and Jacqueline Sommer: their collection totalled nearly three thousand hunting-related objects, including nearly five hundred engravings. The museum displays ancient and contemporary works together: in the Salon of the Dogs, a collection of gold dog collars throughout the ages is displayed alongside 17th-century portraits of Louis XIV's pets and a small white version of the Scottie dog sculpture Puppy by contemporary American ceramic artist Jeff Koons. It also includes fantastical elements: an alcove dedicated to unicorns contains a small curio cabinet, the 2005 video Unicorn by French video artist Ma√Øder Fortune, work by contemporary artist Jean-Michel Othoniel, and a 1957 sculpture by Janine Janet. Collection Salle des Troph√©es The museum is organized around three themes: weapons and other instruments of hunting such as guns and horns; hunting products such as trophies and taxidermied animals; and artistic representations of wildlife and hunting such as paintings, prints, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics and furniture. * Weapons and hunting accessories The museum includes an array of weaponry from the 16th through to the 19th centuries, including spears, cross bows, hunting horns, powder flasks and guns. Guns include ones owned by Louis XIII, Marie-Th√©r√®se of Austria, Napoleon Ier, and Napoleon III. * Hunting products The museum houses hundreds of trophies and taxidermied animals from Europe, Africa, Asia and America. These include a polar bear, lion, tiger, cheetah, fox, rhinoceros, bison, water buffalo and many birds. In the Room of Trophies, Le Souillot, a wall- mounted animatronic albino boar head by contemporary French artist Nicolas Darrot, speaks to museum visitors in French. *Paintings and sculptures The museum includes representations of hunting and nature scenes by historically significant artists such as Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, German Renaissance painter Lucas Cranach the Elder, 17th-century Flemish painter Frans Snyders, official 'painter of the hunt and animals' Alexandre-Fran√ßois Desportes and naturalistic French Rococo painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry, as well as contemporary artists such as Belgian multidisciplinary artist and sculptor Jan Fabre, French glass sculptor Jean-Michel Othoniel and contemporary French watercolour painter Francoise Petrovitch.

He was last in charge of Salernitana. Career =Playing= A defender, Menichini played for several top-flight teams, including AS Roma and Catanzaro, the latter under coach Carlo Mazzone. =Coaching= Following his retirement from playing football, Menichini became a coach, serving alongside Carlo Mazzone from 1993 to 2003 with top-flight teams such as Cagliari, AS Roma, Napoli, Bologna, Perugia and Brescia. In 2003, he accepted an offer from newly promoted Serie A team Ancona to become the biancorossi's boss; however, his first experience as head coach proved to be unsuccessful, since he was sacked after four weeks in charge of the team. In February 2005, Menichini returned into football, replacing Salvo D'Adderio at the helm of Sassari Torres, who were in danger of relegation in the Serie C1, and then leading his side to maintain their own place in the third-highest Italian division. Menichini then moved to Albania, as head coach of KF Tirana in 2005‚Äì06; he was however sacked in November 2005 due to disagreements with the board, leaving the club in second place. He then returned to work alongside Mazzone from February to June 2006, during the latter's unsuccessful spell as Livorno head coach. In April 2008, Menichini was appointed as new head coach of Serie C2 promotion hopefuls Lumezzane, replacing Mario Petrone, who was sacked following a string of four consecutive defeats. Under his tenure, Lumezzane qualified to the promotion playoffs and ultimately won them, thus ensuring a place in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione 2008‚Äì09. He was subsequently confirmed at the helm of the club for the upcoming season. In June 2010 he was appointed head coach of Calabrian side Crotone for the club's 2010‚Äì11 Serie B season. He was dismissed on 27 November 2010 after a 1‚Äì2 home loss to Vicenza, leaving Crotone in 11th place after 17 games. He was reinstated as Crotone head coach on 20 February 2011, following a string of negative results that led to the dismissal of Eugenio Corini. On 23 January 2012 he was finally sacked. From 18 December 2012 to 10 February 2013 he then served as head coach of Grosseto in Serie B. In March 2014, he then served as new manager of Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Pisa until the end of the season. On 18 August 2014 he was named new head coach of Lega Pro club Salernitana. On 30 September 2017, he was fired as the head coach of Serie C club Reggiana.

The company began marketing its products in 2003. Research and development is carried out partly by Kaleidescape Canada based in Waterloo, Ontario. History = Early history = Kaleidescape was founded in 2001 by Michael Malcolm, Dan Collens, and Cheena Srinivasan. Malcolm had previously founded Network Appliance and CacheFlow. Malcolm self-funded the startup and the company spent over two years developing its technology in \\"stealth mode\\". The company originally focused on building home theatre movie servers that could store digital copies of customers‚Äô DVD and Blu-ray collections to help streamline the DVD and Blu-ray experience. Kaleidescape‚Äôs first movie server was introduced in 2003 and could import DVD content onto a series of hard drives, utilize the company‚Äôs Movie Guide database to identify and sort films, and then present the customer‚Äôs movie collection in an onscreen user interface. In 2010, Kaleidescape released its M300 and M500 Blu-ray players as part of its Premiere line for home cinemas. The M500 had Blu-ray copying abilities to allow customers to import Blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs onto home servers. To address the copyright concerns of movie studios, Kaleidescape required the Blu-ray disc to be present when the content was played from the server. Later that year, Kaleidescape launched the industry's first Blu-ray server with its release of its new 100-disc Blu-ray vault. The vault, when paired with the M300 or M500 players, could rip, store, and stream copies of Blu-ray movies throughout a home. The server‚Äôs internal storage could hold 2,700 DVD titles or 485 Blu-ray discs but is dependent on the size of the hard drives you bought with your system. In July 2013, Kaleidescape launched the Cinema One as the company's new entry-level high-definition entertainment server. Cinema One is a movie server that allows users to watch films instantly and jump to special scenes, bypassing menus. Through Kaleidescape's online movie store, which launched in beta in 2012 and officially opened in May 2013, users are able to add high-definition and standard definition movies to their collections instantly. Cinema One allows the storage and playback of up to 100 Blu-ray quality, 600 DVD quality or 6,000 CD quality titles. = Recent history = Kaleidescape's current product line was announced in 2015, and consists of the Strato movie player and the Terra movie server. The Strato is a movie-playback device and is compatible with different control systems and universal remotes, and can hold anywhere from 105 Ultra 4K HDR movies to 1500 DVD quality movies, depending on which version of the device is purchased. Content is added to the device by downloading movies from the Kaleidescape movie store. The Terra provides computing and caching services to enhance the performance of the Strato, and provides extra storage space for movies purchased from the store. The Strato C movie player was released in 2017. It has no hard drive to store content, but streams content from either the Strato S or the Terra movie server, with the same audio and video quality of the Strato S. That same year, Kaleidescape also released its 1U+ Movie Server, which was an upgrade of the 1U Server. In October 2018, the company introduced the Kaleidescape mobile app for home cinema. The app can be used to buy movies from the movie store, control the playback of films, concerts, and TV shows, and receive movie recommendations. It includes a remote designed to make it easy to control the onscreen display using a smartphone, and is free to Kaleidescape owners. In December, Kaleidescape announced a partnership with BBC Studios - Americas to bring BBC documentaries and TV series to Kaleidescape. The deal marked the first time the company offered episodic content in 4K Ultra HD and HDR.  Products  = The Strato = The Strato S is a ‚Äúmovie player,‚Äù a disc-less playback device that users can add content to by downloading titles from Kaleidescape's movie store to the device's hard drive. The Strato S is available in a 6TB and a 12TB version; there is also an external server called the Terra if more space is needed. The rear of the Strato provides a connection for the external power supply, an HDMI output, an audio only HDMI output, a toslink and coax digital audio output, a USB connection, an ethernet connection, and a rear IR input. It has built-in 802.11ac WiFi, and can output 3840x2160 resolution at 60 Hz along with extended color and HDR. It supports a range of audio formats, including Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital, PCM, DTS:X, DTS-HD Master Audio, and MPEG audio. Playback from the hard drive or the network delivers bit rates up to 100 Mbps and frame rates up to 60 fps. = The Terra = For customers who require more storage space, Kaleidescape designed the Terra Movie Server. The Terra comes with either 24 or 40TB of storage - allowing storage of more than 400 4K Ultra HD movies, 600 Blu-ray quality, or 3600 DVD quality movies - and can supply content to as many as 50 Strato players. Once connected to the network, the Strato players can either access their own movie collections, or those of the Terra. For homes with more than one Strato, the Terra can handle up to ten 4K streams or 15 Blu-ray streams at a time. The Terra also provides computing and caching services to enhance the performance of the Strato players. Kaleidescape movie store The Kaleidescape movie store launched in May 2013 in the US and June 2013 in the UK, becoming the first online store to allow users to download Blu-ray quality movies via an internet-based delivery platform. The movie store is only built to work with Kaleidescape's playback systems. Purchased and downloaded movies are stored on the company's Strato S or Terra products, and played back on the Strato. The only way to add content to a Kaleidescape system is to download movies from the store to the device‚Äôs hard drive. The store allows users to upgrade movies from SD to HD to UHD. Kaleidescape supports download speeds of up to 100 Mbps, and it is possible to set a maximum download speed and a download schedule. The movie store's initial title offerings included a multi-year license agreement with Warner Bros. The movie store expanded its availability to Canada in September 2013. In October 2013, Kaleidescape announced a multi-year studio agreement with Lionsgate, resulting in the addition of approximately 2,000 titles to the store. ;Major Studio Support * Warner Bros. * Sony Pictures Home Entertainment * NBCUniversal * Lionsgate * Twentieth Century Fox * Walt Disney Studios *MGM ;Minor Studio Support * Cinedigm * Kino Lorber * Magnolia * Moving Art * The Orchard Legal issues In 2004, the DVD Copy Control Association, the licensor of CSS (content scramble system), the technology for the copy control of DVDs, sued Kaleidescape for breach of contract.

Kaleidescape Systems allow users to rip, store, and stream video from DVDs. The case, although only for breach of contract and not a copyright case, was considered by some to be an important recent test of fair use precedent, given advancements in technology and the digital media rights field. In 2007, Kaleidescape won the case. In fact, the DVD CCA had alleged that Kaleidescape had breached terms in a document called the General Specifications. The court ruled that the General Specifications are not even part of the contract. On August 13, 2009, a California appellate court reversed the lower court's decision that the General Specifications is not part of the CSS License, and sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings (see DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc.). This appellate court ruling did not address the issue of whether Kaleidescape violated the contract (contrary to some news reports), instead deferring that determination to the lower court. In March 2012, the Superior Court ruled that Kaleidescape had violated the terms of the contract, and issued an injunction prohibiting it from selling or supporting the products in question. The California 6th District Court of Appeal granted Kaleidescape a temporary stay of the injunction on March 29, 2012. This temporary stay stops the injunction from coming into effect, while the Court of Appeal decides whether or not to stay the injunction during the entire appeal process. In June 2014, Kaleidescape and DVD CCA reached a settlement agreement. As of 2019, the company had license agreements with 29 studios to allow the purchase and download of content from its movie store. References External links * Kaleidescape * Kaleidescape, Inc.

A staunch supporter of the concept of public disclosure, \\"sunshine\\" laws, and Open Records Acts, Harber fought a precedent-setting battle against the State of Colorado in 1982 in which the Secretary of State ultimately was required to release public information in its most usable form (i.e. electronic). A decade later, in 1993, he won a case against another government entity (NCWCD, the Northern Colorado Water Conservatory District) which had tried to use the law and the cost of litigation to hide important public information.

At Princeton, Harber became the first person in the then 220-year history of the university to win the two awards for being the person who did the most for his class (the W. Sanderson Detwiler 1903 Prize) and the most for the University (the Class of 1901 Medal). Harber received a master's degree in public administration (MPA) from Harvard University's John F.

He was elected as chairman of the innovative fiber-optic large-display company Mall TV, Inc. and served as chairman of one of the nation's first retail virtual reality companies, V-Space, Inc.

Harber has served on the Accountability Committee for his daughter's public school, Peak to Peak, and has worked as a volunteer serving food in the school's cafeteria. During the time he was registered as an Investment Adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Harber extensively donated his financial and tax advisory services to men and women starting businesses as well as to charitable organizations on a pro bono basis. He continues to informally advise many groups today, also at no charge. Harber pioneered the vision for the Golden Run community in Erie, Colorado (a zero net energy, zero net waste, environmentally sustainable, climate change- sensitive standalone community) as an example of a modified New Urbanism development imaginatively designed to create a walkable, economically sustainable, environmentally friendly multi-generational neighborhood. Golden Run's design focuses on the needs of mature adults, senior citizens in their later years, young families, the disabled, and people requiring special care levels. The concept is to create a community where people can live, work, play, recreate, shop, and enjoy life together, all in an ecologically sound manner.
