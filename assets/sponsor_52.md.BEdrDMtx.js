His main goal was to eliminate the Emirate of Samosata as a commercial and military rival of the Edessene state. The expedition was carried out from 14 to 20 February 1098.  Circumstances of the War  Baldwin decided upon his ascension of co-regent of Edessa that Samosata would have to be eliminated in order for his new county to fully control the surrounding countryside and to establish unbroken communications with Byzantium in the west and the crusaders sieging Antioch in the south. The Armenian, Christian inhabitants of Edessa enthusiastically supported his plan, and the main part of their military accompanied him. He set out on 14 February, also accompanied by an Armenian princeling, Constantine of Gargar.  The Conflict  Despite the help of the Edessene militia, the expedition was not to turn out favorably for Baldwin. The Edessenes were poor, inexperienced soldiers, and the company was quickly caught in an ambush by the Turks of Samosata, who slew around a thousand of them in the ensuing battle. Baldwin, however, did manage to capture and garrison the village of St. John, which was close to Balduk's capital. From this point, he was able to control the flow of the Turks in and out of the city, resulting in a decline in Turkish raids into the Edessene countryside.

It is in the collection of the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. The painting serves as Quick- to-See Smith's tribute to Montana, where she grew up. Description The painting is a tribute to where Quick-to-See Smith grew up: Montana. The painting, which is acrylic paint on canvas, features Quick-to-See Smith's interpretation of George Catlin's painting, Ee-he-a-duck-chee-a (He Who Ties His Hair Before) in the middle of the painting, in black paint. Logos for Purina and Krispy Kreme are depicted, as is the painted words \\"french fries.\\" Next to \\"french fries\\" are two hands painted saying \\"french fries\\" in American Sign Language. Half of a blue sign is on the right of the canvas, with \\"Hecho en USA\\" spilling off the canvas. \\"$19.99\\" is painted in the upper left corner. The painting is signed and inscribed on the back, top edge of the painting, using black marker. It reads: [illeg.] Smith 2002 \\"THE RANCHER\\" ACl 72\\" x 48\\" Curatorial analysis In this work, Quick-to-See Smith seeks to reject stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America, by using Caitlin's work. The use of the brand logos is believed assert \\"that Native peoples can be simultaneously traditional and contemporary,\\" according to curators at the Hood Museum of Art. \\"Hecho en USA\\" is meant to reflect \\"the intermingling of languages, cultures, and subcultures of America.\\" Additionally, the word \\"french fries\\" and the sign language are meant to depict how Native peoples often must incorporate new ideas and words into their lexicon and lives as they seek to remain connected to modern life.

Country The Wanman's territory (waran) extends over some . Their southern boundary lays around the McKay Range and the area of Lake Disappointment. Westwards, it reaches Wadurara on the Rudall River. The northern frontier lays in the vicinity of Lake Dora/Walerelere, Mendidjildjil and Karbardi, while they are present eastwards as far as the George, Wooloomber and Auld lakes. The change from their beloved claypan lakes country (tjapipodari] to mulga terrain in the south marked a limit beyond which they thought danger lay. Language Ecology As often natural features can mark a kind of informal boundary between tribes. With the Wanman, that boundary in the south is delineated by the transition from their clumpy porcupine grassland to the thick mulga shrubland of the Kartudjara. The onset of drought would push them northwest, to around Karbardi and Pulburukuritji, and Kalamilji. Their harsh almost treeless sandhill landscape is mostly devoid of larger game like emu and kangaroo, though the hare wallaby and opossum, if caught, would provide some meat. Its poor grassland constrains the Wanman to develop grass-milling in order to eke out food from seeds, one of the few Australian tribes, such as the Ualarai and the Pila Nguru, who resort to this technique A list of the primary foods was provided to Norman Tindale by one tribesman: * Their main cereal food (mai) came from threshing and winnowing Triodia grass seed (≈ãotja 'waruru). * Cyperus bulbs (qalku) could be harvested from clay flats lying between the sand-dunes sometime after heavy rains had fallen. * Hare wallaby (mala) were hunted down with a throwing stick (kitibaru). * Brushtail possum (kuji/wigamu.) * Porcupines (tjilka). * Cossid moth grubs (pilku) found on shrub roots. * Pig weevil grubs (tjulalu.) * Lizards (watawata) such as the sleepy lizard (luma). * Black goanna, and sand goannas (walana). * Sandhill frogs (boboka) found after rain sweeps the desert. * Ducks (kunjilidja) were elusive but their eggs, laid after the rains, were prized. Portulaca seeds, once harvested, were worked in stone- rings The kitibaru also served as a digging stick to forage for marsupial moles. String spun from animals or hair, worn around the waist, was used to lasso lizards, and then hitch them to a string belt to bring back to the campsite. Social organization The Wanman were probably divided into six hordes, each with its own wells. Such estates gave exclusive wood-cutting rights to each member of the horde but Wanman from all clans had equal access to the major watering holes (wongal) Drought would at times force them into Nyangumarta land where, in exchange for water, they would be constrained to hand over their women in marriage. The Nyangumarta themselves would often raid the Wanman in order to secure wives. History of contact The extreme conditions of desert life pressed the Wanman to develop techniques to harvest food from grasses and this traditional knowledge served them well as they moved towards the coast, since they could quickly adapt their skills to glean buffel or afghan grass, which had seeded into the landscape from imported camel saddles and was in demand as a fodder grass in arid zones.

People are all eating out of the single dish, that is, all hunting in the shared territory. One spoon signifies that all Peoples sharing the territory are expected to limit the game they take to leave enough for others, and for the continued abundance and viability of the hunting grounds into the future. Sometimes the Indigenous language word is rendered in English as bowl or kettle rather than dish. The Dish With One Spoon phrase is also used to denote the treaty or agreement itself. In particular, a treaty made between the Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee nations at Montr√©al in 1701, as part of the Great Peace of Montreal is usually called the Dish With One Spoon treaty and its associated wampum belt the Dish With One Spoon wampum. The treaty territory includes part of the current province of Ontario between the Great Lakes and extending east along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River up to the border with the current province of Quebec. Some claim it also includes parts of the current states of New York and Michigan.  Other references  While there are unsubstantiated claims that Indigenous Nations made agreements with neighboring nations to share hunting grounds since time immemorial, the earliest documented reference to the concept occurs in the Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace, which one may call the founding constitution of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Haudenosaunee oral tradition states this founding was in time immemorial. However, scholars Barbara Mann and Jerry Fields tie a number of oral history stories to the dates of solar eclipses and conclude the Confederacy was formed on August 31, 1142. In addition, they claim archaeological evidence of palisades built around villages and the earliest cultivation of corn supports a date between 900-1200 CE. In the Great Law of Peace there is a specific entreaty to have \\"no knife near our dish\\" so that the sharing is guaranteed to be without bloodshed. The Dish With One Spoon reference in the Great Law of Peace expressly mandates conserving the game roaming about in the hunting grounds, as well as requiring its sharing. It also contains a promise to share equally in the harvests of the fields. In the late 18th century, Ojibwe and Dakota, traditional enemies, agreed to meet each year at the beginning of winter, smoke a peace pipe, and then throughout the hunting season exchange friendly visits, and hunt in the common territory without harming each other. Further south in the current state of Georgia, in the mid 18th century, the Creeks and Cherokee agreed to a peace treaty on Dish With One Spoon terms with the small difference that it specified a dividing line between their hunting territories with some parts being dedicated to each nation.  Events leading up to the treaty  The fur trade generated a huge demand for beaver furs and specifically ones from northern climes which were more desirable because they were thicker. Haudenosaunee wanted the European goods available in trade, so they were almost continually fighting nations in those territories. Montagnais, Algonquin and some Haudenosaunee nations negotiated a peace in 1624 at Trois-Rivi√®res and Qu√©bec to share the area for hunting. French and Dutch colonial authorities did not like this peace that did not involve them because it portended a lessening of their economic power. Hence they fostered distrust among the Indigenous Nations which succeeded in breaking the peace within a few years. In September 1645, Wendat, Kichesipirini, Montagnais, and Mohawk negotiated another peace at Trois- Rivi√®res to share the area for hunting, and renewed it in February 1646. This peace broke down almost immediately when Five Nations warriors raided north and westward into Wendat territory in the fall of 1646. It is probable that the Five Nations did that not only for the superior pelts, but also because they had almost rendered the beaver extinct in their home territory south of Lake Ontario. Five Nations raiding continued and intensified until the 1680s and 90s when the French mounted a serious military offensive against them. In the 1640s, the Mississaugas, an Anishinaabe Nation, in response to Haudenosaunee raiding and to avoid smallpox epidemics decimating sedentary agricultural tribes with whom they shared land, left their traditional territory on the north shore of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River and fled north and west. In the 1670s, with help from the Odawa and Chippewa, they returned and contributed to the growing pressure from the French against the Haudenosaunee.  The treaty  New York colonial documents show that various tribes met in their hunting grounds in the late 1690s to start discussing peace, and in the summer of 1700, representatives of various Anishinaabe and other western nations met with a Haudenosaunee council in Onondaga to discuss peace. At that meeting the western nations requested to be part of the Covenant Chain and to share hunting grounds in accordance with the Dish With One Spoon principle. That was followed by a meeting of chiefs from the Five Nations and 19 other nations at Montr√©al in September, at which a wampum belt described as \\"making one joint kettle when we shall meet\\", most probably the Dish With One Spoon belt, was presented by the Haudenosaunee. All parties agreed to a larger meeting in Montr√©al the following year at which the Great Peace of Montreal was signed on August 4. A couple of weeks earlier on July 19, the Haudenosaunee had concluded an agreement with the British at Albany where, in an attempt to ensure the protection of the British, they conveyed the entire territory to them. Scholars argue that the two sides had differing understandings of the terms of the conveyance, with the Haudenosaunee expecting only British protection of the territory and the British expecting to be able to extend New York into it.  After the treaty  The Montr√©al treaty proved to be long lasting, and there are many references to it and to the Dish With One Spoon wampum in the historical record. A few examples: In 1765, Daniel Claus, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, wrote to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, reminding him of the 1701 treaty at which the French governor had told the agreeing Indigenous Nations that \\"the Woods, and Hunting Grounds could be no otherwise than in common, and free to one Nation as to another.\\" In 1793 Six Nations chief Joseph Brant wrote to Indian Affairs superintendent Alexander McKee explaining that the Indian Affairs Department's claim that some part of the country near Grand River belongs to the Six Nations is in error, because about a hundred years earlier there was an agreement to share the lands with other Indigenous Peoples for hunting purposes, and there is a Dish With One Spoon wampum which supports his position. Brant's claim is supported by Mississauga oral tradition which states that the land north of eastern Lake Erie, all of Lake Ontario, and the western north shore of the St. Lawrence River has been Mississauga territory since time immemorial and they agreed to share it in the Dish With One Spoon treaty. In 1824, Wendat chief Tsaouenhohi told the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada that about two hundred years earlier seven nations had concluded a treaty to eat with the same spoon from the same bowl. Given that only 123 years had elapsed since the Montr√©al treaty, it is not clear whether Tsaouenhohi was referring to it or to one of the earlier treaties in the mid 17th century. During a treaty gathering in 1840, Six Nations wampum keeper John Skanawati Buck presented four wampum belts, including one which commemorated the Dish With One Spoon. Buck stated it represented the first treaty, to share hunting grounds, made between the Anishinaabe and the Six Nations many years earlier in Montr√©al. Mississauga oral tradition differs, claiming that the treaty was only made with the Mohawks. The belt was kept at Six Nations of the Grand River by Buck until his death in 1893, after which time the belts in his possession were dispersed, with some sold to traders and collectors. The belt was later recorded to be in possession of Evelyn H.C. Johnson who donated it to the Royal Ontario Museum in 1922. In 1915, Seth Newhouse, an Onondaga chief, wrote to King George V protesting that the restrictive game laws of the province of Ontario were making it impossible for his people to get enough sustenance from hunting and asking the King to send to them a picture of himself holding the treaty document so they could use it to challenge those laws. The Indian Affairs Department intercepted the letter and it was not delivered.  Today  It is now customary in Canada to acknowledge at meetings and other events that the event is taking place on territory which was and may still be Indigenous territory. The Dish With One Spoon has been incorporated into many territorial acknowledgements for organizations and institutions in the Toronto area, including the Council of Ontario Universities and ministries of the Toronto Conference of the United Church of Canada. Today, some see the treaty as a covenant that applies to all those living in Southern Ontario, including Indigenous Peoples not party to the original treaty, as well as settlers and newcomers. The belt currently resides at the Royal Ontario Museum. It is mostly made of white whelk shells with a small area of purple quahog clam shells in the center of the belt representing the dish.

The Delhi army defeated and killed the powerful Paramara minister Goga, while the Paramara king Mahalakadeva took shelter in the Mandu fort. Alauddin appointed Ayn al-Mulk Multani as the governor of Malwa. After consolidating his power in Malwa, Ayn al-Mulk besieged Mandu and killed Mahalakadeva.  Background  The Paramara dynasty ruled the Malwa region in central India. By 1305, nearly all the Indian rulers to the north of Malwa had acknowledged Alauddin's suzerainty. The Paramara king Mahalakadeva was a weak ruler, and his prime minister (pradhan) Goga (called Koka in Muslim chronicles) was more powerful than him.  Goga's death  In 1305, Alauddin sent a cavalry to capture Malwa. It is not clear who commanded this army, but he might have been Ayn al-Mulk Multani, whom Alauddin later appointed as the governor of Malwa. According to the Delhi chronicler Amir Khusrau, the Delhi army comprised 10,000 soldiers, who had been selected specifically for the mission. According to Khusrau, the Malwa army commanded by Goga comprised a 30,000-40,000 strong cavalry and an \\"innumerable\\" infantry. The later historians Yahya, Firishta, and Hajiuddabir state that the Malwa army comprised 40,000 cavalry and 100,000 infantry. In the ensuing battle, the Delhi army emerged victorious. Khusrau states that the battlefield was \\"bloody with mud\\" as far as the human eye could see. Goga's horse was caught in a mire, and he was killed by arrows. His head was sent to Delhi, where it was trampled under the feet of horses at the palace gates. Alauddin appointed Ayn al-Mulk as the governor of Malwa. Ayn al-Mulk raided the former Paramara capital Dhara, where he broke the Dhar iron pillar. The former Paramara vassals were forced to recognize Alauddin's suzerainty. These included the chiefs of the Ujjain, Dhar, and Chanderi cities. Ayn al-Mulk sent a detailed record of his success to Delhi, where a week-long celebration was held and sweets were distributed among public for the entire week.  Mahalakadeva's death  After the establishment of peaceful conditions in a large part of Malwa, Ayn al-Mulk marched to Mandu, where the Paramara king Mahalakadeva stayed. Mahalakadeva sent an army led by his son to fight the invaders. However, his son was killed on the battlefield, and his army was defeated. The Delhi army besieged Mandu, and managed to enter it, after one of Mahalakadeva's fort guards betrayed him. The guard told the invaders about a secret entrance to the fort. Using this passage, the Delhi army entered the Mandu fort at night, taking Mahalakadeva by surprise. Mahalakadeva fled to a spring called Sar (Chashm-i Sar in the Delhi chronicles), where he was killed. The Delhi army captured the fort on 23 November 1305, and Alauddin assigned it to Ayn al-Mulk. An inscription from Udaipur indicates that the Paramara dynasty survived in the north-eastern part of Malwa in 1310. However, this area had also come under the Delhi Sultanate rule by the Tughluq period in 1338.

Fitzgerald, retired FBI agent, criminal profiler and forensic linguist. The series, published by Infinity Publishing between 2014 and 2017, consists of three volumes detailing chronologically the life and career circumstances that led to Jim Fitzgerald's involvement in the FBI's UNABOM investigation, which ultimately resulted in the arrest and prosecution of Theodore Kaczinski, also known as the Unabomber.  JCM Book I: The Coming-of-Age Years (2014)  The first volume of the series is an account of Fitzgerald's early years, from childhood to his graduation from the Police Academy. The book describes various formative relationships and encounters with friends (including a future convicted killer), law breakers, and police‚Äîinfluences that set him on a path toward a long and successful career in law enforcement.  JCM Book II: The Police Officer Years (2017)  The second book in the series recounts Fitzgerald's most significant experiences as a police officer in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, from his first night on patrol‚Äîa \\"trial by fire\\" that resulted in headlines‚Äîto his initiation into the politics of the legal system. JCM II chronicles the investigations, arrests, and prosecutions that led to Fitzgerald's promotion to sergeant and ultimately his recruitment to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  JCM Book III: The (First Ten) FBI Years (2017)  The third volume resumes the story of Fitzgerald's progression in law enforcement, beginning with his time at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia before proceeding to his first assignment at the New York Field Division's highly respected Joint Bank Robbery Task Force, where his participation in the arrests of robbers, kidnappers, extortionists, murderers, and pedophiles eventually resulted in promotion to Criminal Profiler at the National Center for the Investigation of Violent Crime, which would later give rise to the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). The book concludes with the account of Fitzgerald's first assignment as a profiler with the UNABOM Task Force in San Francisco, California, where his skills in forensic linguistics were instrumental in the arrest and successful prosecution of the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, hence resolving what had been the most prolonged and expensive investigation in the history of the FBI.

Alauddin's forces had been besieging the fort for several past years, but had been unsuccessful in capturing it. In August-September 1308, Alauddin personally arrived from Delhi, and took charge of the operations at Siwana. The Delhi army breached the fort after a few months. Faced with a defeat, Sitala Deva, the ruler of the Siwana, tried to flee, but was captured and killed.  Background  At the beginning of the 14th century, the present-day Rajasthan had several small principalities centered around hill forts. Most of these principalities had acknowledged Alauddin's suzerainty after his conquest of the powerful Ranthambore (1301) and Chittor (1303) kingdoms. However, the forts of Siwana and Jalore, located in the south-west end of Rajasthan, remained independent. Siwana, located near the Thar Desert, was controlled by a Paramara chief named Sitala Deva (also called \\"Satal Deo\\" or \\"Sital Dev\\" in medieval chronicles). A number of local chiefs acknowledged his suzerainty. According to the Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau's Dawal Rani, the Delhi army had been besieging the Siwana fort for 5‚Äì6 years without any success. The legendary poem Kanhadade Prabandha claims that on one occasion, the Jalore Chahamana ruler Kanhadadeva sent an army in Sitala Deva's aid. The joint force defeated the Delhi army, killing the invading commanders Nahar Malik and Khandadhara Bhoja.  Siege  In 1308, Alauddin decided to personally lead an expedition to Siwana. He started his march from Delhi on 2 July 1308, and took charge of the siege operations in Siwana in August‚ÄìSeptember 1308. The Delhi army surrounded the fort from all sides, with Alauddin leading the contingent stationed on the eastern side of the fort. Malik Kamal al-Din 'Gurg' (or Kamaluddin) was in-charge of the siege engines (munjaniqs). The Delhi army tried to capture the fort using many methods, including a shower of arrows from the siege engines. For over three months, the defenders foiled their attempts, by throwing fire and stones at them. Meanwhile, the invaders had been constructing a pasheb, an inclined mound reaching up to the fort battlements. Once the mound was completed, Alauddin's army scaled the fort walls, and defeated the defenders after a full day of battle. The Kanhadade Prabandha claims that Sitala Deva was betrayed by a man named Bhayala, with whose helped Alauddin defiled the main water tank of Siwana with cows' blood. As the cows are sacred to Hindus, Siwana lost its main source of water. Facing a desperate situation, the women of the fort committed jauhar (mass self-immolation), while the men decided to fight to their deaths. Sital Deva tried to flee to Jalor, but the Delhi soldiers ambushed and killed him on 10 November 1308. His head was later presented to Alauddin. The contemporary writer Amir Khusrau states that he was a man of huge stature, and Alauddin was astonished on seeing his giant head. The 16th- century historian Firishta incorrectly states that Sitala Deva ultimately surrendered by sending a golden statue of himself to Alauddin and asking for a pardon (which was granted). Firishta appears to have confused Sital Deva with the Kakatiya king Prataparudra. After the conquest, Siwana was renamed Khayrabad. It was assigned to Malik Kamal al-Din 'Gurg', who later led the army that captured Jalore.

It is a Grade II* listed building. Description The blue plaque on the wall Southeast facade The original administrative building for the town was ascribed to the late 13th-century Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Glamorgan. The cellar dates from this old courthouse. The present building, in the centre of the old town, was constructed under the lordship of Jasper Tudor in around 1490 and used to collect rents and as a venue for the weekly market. Fairs were also held in the building at weekends. The windows of the Town Hall may have been installed later: they are similar to those of the Old Swan Pub opposite, which date from around 1570. After being found in a state of \\"utter ruin and decay\\", it was refurbished in the late 16th century and in subsequent years the lower floor functioned as a school, a slaughterhouse and a jail while the upper floor served as a venue for church meetings and was leased to the St. Illtyd's lodge of the Odd Fellows in 1845. Notes the name of the local lodge as \\"St. Illtyd's lodge\\" In the late 19th century, management of the building passed to the new parish council formed under the Local Government Act 1894. It subsequently passed to the town council which has used the town hall as its meeting place since it was formed in 1978. A major refurbishment was carried out in 2017; the refurbishment works, which entirely related to the main hall, included removal of the stage, sanding and re-varnishing the flooring and installing traditional lighting. The building is constructed of stone and has two stories, with chimney stacks and rows of mullioned windows on the long elevations. At the northeast end are two flights of stone stairs leading to an enclosed landing, above which is a large circular clock. The clock was presented to the town in 1887 to mark the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria. At the apex of the northeast gable end is a bell turret with an ancient bell. The bell bears the inscription, Sancte Iltute, ora pro nobis (\\"Saint Illtyd, pray for us\\").Newell, p. 116 The building contains a hall and a council chamber. The ground floor room at the northeast end is currently used as a Tourist Information office. A blue plaque recording the historical importance of the building was placed on the town hall in February 2007.

Kessler is a supporter of neo-Nazism, far-right politics, and the alt-right. Background Jason Kessler graduated from the University of Virginia with a bachelor of arts in psychology in 2009. Prior to his involvement in political extremism, Kessler wrote that he was employed in various working class jobs as a dishwasher, gym technician, truck driver and handyman. Up to 2008, Kessler was a supporter of Democrats and held liberal views. He had worked for Secrest Strategic Services and had voted for Barack Obama during his presidential run. He also engaged in activism with the Occupy movement before being dismissed for attempting to register homeless individuals. According to a public Facebook post by former college friend, Jenny Rebecca, Kessler lived for a time in government-subsidized housing with a roommate who was described as an African Muslim.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/inside-jason-kesslers- hate-fueled-rise/2018/08/11/335eaf42-999e-11e8-b60b-1c897f17e185_story.html In late 2015, Kessler began his original blog JasonKessler.net. The site was used to publish a noir crime novel, Badland Blues, as well as a work of poetry, Midnight Road. In November 2016, he revealed lewd and offensive tweets made by Charlottesville vice-mayor and councilman Wes Bellamy, who is also a teacher at Charlottesville's Albemarle High School. Bellamy first drew criticism from Kessler when he called a press conference to call for the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville in March 2016. In December, Kessler began circulating a petition demanding that Bellamy resign or be removed from office. During the ensuing investigations, Bellamy voluntarily resigned from his teaching position at Albemarle High School in December 2016. In January 2017, while attempting to gain signatures for his petition, Kessler was arrested for misdemeanor assault after punching a man in the face. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 50 hours of community service and 30 days of suspended sentence. A charge of perjury was filed but subsequently dropped. In April 2017, Kessler was contracted to write two pieces for The Daily Caller. He wrote another piece in May about the first protests in Charlottesville over the statue of Lee. Kessler also wrote several posts for the anti-immigrant white nationalist site VDare. One of Kessler's posts claimed that the government was waging genocide against white people by policies that cause low Caucasian birth rates. After ProPublica contacted The Daily Caller about Kessler's ties to white supremacist groups, the outlet severed its ties with Kessler, and its Executive Editor Paul Conner defended his editorial judgment. Kessler was sworn in as a member of the far-right organization the Proud Boys. Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes said that he kicked Kessler out of the group once his views on race became known. 2017 Unite the Right rally Video posted to YouTube by Kessler on August 11, 2017 after obtaining permission for the Unite the Right rally Video posted to YouTube by Kessler on August 12, 2017 after the rally. Kessler was one of the organizers of the Unite the Right rally on August 12, 2017. The rally was a protest of the removal of the statue of Robert E. Lee, a cause Kessler had taken up a year earlier when he began his crusade against Bellamy. Kessler was also involved in a smaller protest of the removal of the statue on May 14, 2017, which ended in a torch-lit march. At this event, he was arrested for failure to obey an officer's commands. On July 11, Kessler appeared at town hall to promote his rally and distanced himself from another rally that was held by the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. On July 25, Kessler and most speakers scheduled to attend the rally were described by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as alt-right leaders. The ADL's director said that Kessler was listed because of both his statements and his activities.nbc29.com: \\"ADL Lists Kessler, Other 'Unite The Right' Speakers as White Supremacists\\" , July 25, 2017 Kessler responded by calling the ADL hypocritical for \\"attacking uppity whites when they support the ethno-state of Israel\\" and saying he was \\"happy to be considered the enemy of the ADL\\". On August 7, the city manager attempted to change the location of the rally, away from Emancipation Park towards McIntire Park. The city manager confirmed that Kessler had a First Amendment right to protest but stressed the city's need to protect public safety.c-ville.com: \\"Rally relocation: City okays permit for McIntire Park, Kessler refuses to change\\", August 7, 2017 On August 10, the Rutherford Institute and the Virginia state branch of the ACLU supported Kessler in an injunction lawsuit, later known as Kessler v City of Charlottesville, in the United States District Court. They pointed out that \\"Two other groups that oppose Kessler's message, which have called on thousands of protesters to attend, have been granted permits by the city for downtown parks close to Emancipation Park on August 12.\\" Arguments were heard in Judge Glen Conrad's courtroom on the afternoon of August 11. The court enjoined the city from revoking Kessler's permit to conduct a demonstration at Emancipation Park on August 12, and the rally went ahead.realnewsdelaware.com: \\"‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally tomorrow in Charlottesville, VA\\" , August 11, 2017 The rally on August 12 turned violent and resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, when one of the rally attendees drove at high speed into a crowd of counter-protestors several blocks from the rally. On the day following the rally Kessler attempted to hold a news conference in front of Charlottesville City Hall which was quickly overtaken by protesters. However, before ending the short news conference Kessler stated \\"I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic.\\" He also posted videos online in which he blames the city for the violence and death. On August 18, 2017, Kessler contradicted his previous statement by tweeting \\"Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time.\\" The next morning Kessler repudiated the tweet and blamed Ambien, Xanax, and alcohol for the tweet. He received criticism for the tweet from other white nationalists including Richard B. Spencer and Tim Gionet. Kessler subsequently deleted his Twitter account. Hacker and internet troll Andrew Aurenheimer, a.k.a. Weev, later claimed that he hacked Kessler's Twitter account. Kessler was allowed to move to Ohio in October 2018. Earlier that month, Kessler was arrested on suspicion of doxing after local anti- racist activist Emily Gorcenski was swatted and reported the incidents to the police. On September 6, 2018, a jury in Charlottesville ordered Jeffrey Winder to pay a fine of $1 and no jail time for the misdemeanor assault charge against Kessler that took place on August 13, 2017. Winder and his attorney James Abrenio appealed his original February 2018 guilty finding, which included a 30-day jail sentence.  2018 Unite the Right rally  In November 2017, Kessler applied for a permit to hold a rally in Charlottesville in August 2018, on the anniversary of the first march. In December 2017, the city of Charlottesville denied the permit, writing that Kessler's application \\"likely underestimates the number of participants\\" and that \\"no reasonable allocation of city funds or resources\\" could guarantee a violence-free event. Kessler sued the city, and in June 2018, Kessler sought a temporary injunction from the court to permit a rally in Emancipation Park on the anniversary. On June 24, 2018, during a court hearing, Kessler unexpectedly dropped plans to hold a rally in Charlottesville, and posted plans on Twitter for a rally in Washington, D.C.Christal Hayes, 'This isn't the end': Jason Kessler unexpectedly gives up bid for anniversary rally in Charlottesville, USA Today (July 24, 2018).

In addition to Kessler, the former politician and Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was set to address the rally participants.Noah Weiland, Before White Supremacists' Rally, Trump Does Not Condemn Them Specifically, New York Times (August 11, 2018). However, other far-right individuals and groups who participated in the first Unite the Right rally - including Richard B.

In late August, live stream video surfaced of Kessler in which he reveals that due to numerous lawsuits filed against him, he has moved in with his parents. Kessler's father can be heard in the video berating him and demanding that he stop recording white supremacist content in his father's room.

They persist of clothes that are suitable for the Autumn and Winter seasons- coats, knits, etc. = Spring 2018 Collection = The collection was presented after-hours at Disneyland‚Äôs Toon Town. In honour of Mickey Mouse‚Äôs 90th birthday, Lim and Leon collaborated with Disney products to showcase a festive and vibrant collection, featuring a marching band and runway walks by Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Disneyland Toontown Drawing from all the latest trends, the designers presented a range of crafty knitwear, sporty graphics, prairie dresses and carpenter pants infused with enlarged and repeated prints of Mickey. Walt Disney with Mickey Mouse = Spring 2019 Collection = Le Poisson Rouge Held at Le Poisson Rouge was one of Opening Ceremony‚Äôs most eccentric shows, ‚ÄòThe Gift of Showz‚Äô. A drag spectacle featuring renowned drag queens: Sasha Velour, Shea Coule√©, West Dakota, Lypsinka and 40 others. The show finale was opened by Christina Aguilera accompanied by other drag queens and a festive atmosphere. The brand hosted a fashion show uncommon in the fashion industry in hopes to represent different genders and sexual preferences. Leon and Lim merged their own experience on vacations, to imitate a fantastical journey for their Spring 2019 clothing. A repetition of flowy summer frocks and funky floral prints, toned down with all-black outfits are observed. Spring collections are showcased in September and consist of clothes like dresses, skirts and shorts.  Asian Culture  For their 2019 February fashion look-book, the co-founders recognised their asian heritage and culture, by recruiting Asian-American pioneers as their muses. Leon and Lim, both of Asian descent, were inspired by their own and others' journeys of succeeding in an environment where Asians are a minority. The look-book features different Asian pioneers from a range of industries, like the music and culinary industry. Musician and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, chef Angela Dimayuga, and designer Anna Sui were of the few featured. The Opening Ceremony designers aimed to spread a positive message of inclusivity in the fashion industry and recognition to all the Asian creatives working to solidify their own identity in a space where they are not fully represented.  Collaboration  In 2010, the brand collaborated with Maison Margiela, a French luxury fashion house.This collaboration was Maison Margiela‚Äôs first co-branded project in its history. The product outcome was a white Bic pen with the classic Maison Margiela labelling and a plume. The two brands decided to further collaborate in 2011 and designed a whole womenswear line for Margiela‚Äôs MM6 label. In 2017, Opening Ceremony teamed up with the New York City Ballet. Dressed in the brand‚Äôs casual attire, ballerinasperformed their new ballet ‚ÄòThe Times Are Racing‚Äô. The collaboration between the two companies was to portray the juxtaposition between the collectedness of ballet and free-lived expression of people on the streets. Also in 2017, Esprit and Opening Ceremony came together to create a collection of clothes that advocated for both brands‚Äô values towards family and unity. For their model line-up, the brand casted sons and daughters of famous figures like Kim Gordon and Mario Sorrenti. An unexpected collaboration was in 2018 with Crosby studios, a Moscow-based design studio. In lieu of New York Design week, Opening Ceremony and the design studio merged contemporary with playful aesthetics to create a collection of tables, chairs and other small furniture pieces in a monochromatic royal purple colour. = Creative Directors for Kenzo = Kenzo logo In 2011, Lim became the creative director of the brand Kenzo, owned by the multinational corporation, LVMH. After collaborations with multiple brands, the two designers wanted to work further with individual brands, as they thought they could \\"affect the bigger business.\\" Everyone turned them down except brand Kenzo. The designers prepared and presented a pitch in a short amount of time. Their pitch focused on specific alternations of the brand if the two had authoritative power. From the Kenzo experience, aesthetics, interior design of stores to marketing strategies, the duo's attention to detail and long term vision gave them their new position as the creative directors of Kenzo. In 2019, Leon and Lim were removed from their positions as co-creative directors at Kenzo. Their last show was on June 23rd for Kenzo's 2020 Spring collection.  Retail Brands  Opening Ceremony was one of the first retail shops to carry Havaianas and Topshop products. They introduced both, now globally known, brands into the US market. Designer brand, Alexander Wang, has also been selling his products through Opening Ceremony since 2007, along with famous Japanese brand Comme Des Garcons, Proenza Schouler and Rodarte. The cofounders believed that a person willing to buy expensive or designer garments would also be willing to buy cheap t-shirts, socks and random art pieces.  Sales and Advertising  Through curating their retail stores with multiple brands, Opening Ceremony formed relationships with many designers and put their name out into the industry, Opening Ceremony has been able to advertise their practice and products from loud statements about politics, cultures and people..  In popular culture  A list of famous celebrities have attended Opening Ceremony‚Äôs shows and have been spotted wearing Opening Ceremony‚Äôs attire. American actor Jonah Hill wrote the one-act play Lost Cotton for Opening Ceremony's Spring 2015 Collection. In 2017, Spike Jonze wrote and directed \\"Changers\\", a dance performance that starred Lakeith Stanfield and Mia Wasikowska at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. In 2016, Drake wore the bright orange hoodie and sweatpants from the Opening Ceremony x Esprit collection. Troye Sivan and Nicki Minaj along with other LGBTQIA+ models were in attendance at the brand‚Äôs Spring 2019 drag inspired fashion show.  Recent  In 2020, online retailer Farfetch‚Äôs New Guards Group purchased Opening Ceremony and will be taking over the brand. With 18 years of history in the retail market, the brand has decided to close all their physical stores around the world. A huge factor that played into this decision was the rapid change in consumer behaviour and shopping habits.

The People's State of Bavaria was established on 8 November 1918 during the German Revolution, as an attempt at a socialist state to replace the Kingdom of Bavaria within the Weimar Republic. The state was led by Kurt Eisner until his assassination in February 1919, and co-existed with the rival Bavarian Soviet Republic from 6 April 1919, with its government under Johannes Hoffmann exiled in Bamberg. The People's State of Bavaria was dissolved upon the establishment of the Free State of Bavaria on 14 August 1919. Background Postage stamp of Bavaria's King Ludwig III with the overprint Volksstaat Bayern (People's State of Bavaria) The roots of the People's State of Bavaria lay in the German Empire's defeat in the First World War and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. From this chaos erupted the German Revolution of 1918. At the end of October 1918, German sailors began a series of revolts in Kiel and other naval ports. In early November, these disturbances spread civil unrest across Germany. Munich, the capital of Bavaria, was \\"an island of anarchic bohemianism and political radicalism in an otherwise predominantly Roman Catholic rural sea of small towns and timber houses scattered across the foothills of the Alps,\\" according to Michael Burleigh. Alan Bullock writes that \\"Few towns in the Reich were as sensitive to the mood of unrest as Munich: its political atmosphere was unstable and exaggerated towards one extreme or the other,\\"Bullock, Alan (1984) Hitler: A Study in Tyranny (revised ed.) New York: Harper Torchbooks. p. 62 and, according to Joachim Fest, \\"No other city in Germany had been so shaken by the events and emotions of the revolution and the first postwar weeks as excitable Munich.\\"Fest, Joachim C. (1973) Hitler. Winston, Richard and Winston, Clara (trans.) New York: Vintage Books. pp. 109‚Äì111; p. 774‚Äì75 n.1 Extensive constitutional reforms of the governing structure of the Kingdom of Bavaria, under discussion between the royal government and all parliamentary groups since September 1917, were agreed to on 2 November 1918. These included, among other things, the introduction of proportional representation and the transformation of the constitutional monarchy into a parliamentary monarchy. However, events on the ground were outpacing these measures. Beginning on 3 November 1918, protests initiated by the socialist Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) called for peace and demanded the release of detained leaders. On the afternoon of 7 November 1918, the first anniversary of the Russian revolution, Kurt Eisner, an idealistic Independent Social Democratic Party politicianBullock, Alan (1991) Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives New York: Knopf. p. 70. addressed a crowd estimated to have been about 60,000 on the Theresienwiese - current site of the Oktoberfest - in Munich. He demanded an immediate peace, an eight-hour workday, relief for the unemployed, abdication of Bavarian King Ludwig III and the German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and proposed the formation of workers' and soldiers' councils. The crowd marched to the army barracks and won over most of the soldiers; those who didn't go over to the revolution were too war-weary to mount any resistance to it. The combined group, estimated to be more than 100,000, then marched to the Residenz Palace.Mitcham (1996), p. 11 That night, King Ludwig, abandoned by the army, fled from the Palace with his family and took up residence in Anif Palace in nearby Salzburg, for what he hoped would be a temporary stay. He was the first of the monarchs in the German Empire to be deposed. The next day, Eisner, a well-known figure with a long black beard who invariably wore a black overcoat and hat and steel-rimmed spectacles, having gotten the approval of the local revolutionary workers' and soldiers' councils, declared Bavaria a \\"free state\\" - synonymous to \\"republic\\" - a declaration which overthrew the monarchy of the Wittelsbach dynasty, which had ruled Bavaria for over 700 years, and Eisner became Minister-President of Bavaria. Eisner was a middle-class Jew who had been a drama critic in Berlin before he left his wife and family to come to Munich, where he took up with a female journalist, frequented the caf√©s of the Schwabing district of the city, and wrote reviews for the M√ºchener Post - although he later lost his job because he was part of the \\"revisionist right-wing\\" of the Social Democratic Party, which wanted the party to drop its attachment to Marxist ideology. Eisner helped found the Munich branch of the Independent Social Democratic Party and became known for his anti-war stance, which had garnered him eight months in jail after he organized a number of peace strikes in January 1918; he was released under a general amnesty in October 1918.Evans, Richard J. (2003) The Coming of the Third Reich. New York: Penguin. pp. 158‚Äì161 Despite his gift for rhetoric and oratory, Eisner had no political or administrative experience when he became minister-president.Kershaw, Ian (1999) Hitler: Hubris: 1889-1936. New York:Norton. pp.112‚Äì116 Mitcham (1996), p.30 Eisner government Kurt Eisner, the Minister-President of the Free People's State of Bavaria On 12 November 1918, King Ludwig III signed the Anif declaration releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the newly-formed Eisner government interpreted this as an abdication, although to date, no member of the royal House of Wittelsbach has ever formally renounced the throne. Though he advocated a socialist republic, Eisner distanced himself from the Russian Bolsheviks, declaring that his government would protect property rights. For a few days, the Munich social market economist Lujo Brentano served as People's Commissar for Trade (Volkskommissar f√ºr Handel). On 7 January 1919, a Provisional State Constitution (Vorl√§ufiges Staatsgrundgesetz) was promulgated. The new republic started out with many strikes against them. None of the leaders were native Bavarians, and they were bohemians and intellectuals - many of them Jewish - who were conspicuous in their anti-bourgeois bias. Those from the right called Eisner a \\"foreign, racially alien vagabond\\" and a Bolshevist, and his associates as \\"unscrupulous alien scoundrels\\", \\"Jewish rascals\\" and \\"misleaders of labor\\". Eisner did not help matters by declaring his regime would have \\"government by kindness\\", and would create a \\"realm of light, beauty and reason.\\" There were frequent spectacles such as parades, demonstrations, concerts, and speeches, but the regime's philosophical Utopianism won over few converts. Eisner even admitted to German guilt for World War I at a socialist conference in Berne, Switzerland, and, with his secretary Felix Fechenbach, published papers from the official archives of Bavaria which showed the German complicity in the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia in July 1914, after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. Even cabinet ministers were dissatisfied with Eisner's leadership: one of them told him \\"You are an anarchist ... You are no statesman, you are a fool ... We are being ruined by bad management.\\" An organized campaign for Eisner's removal from office was not long in coming. As the new government was unable to provide basic services, it soon lost the support of the conservative Bavarian countryside, necessary for any government to hold together in the rural province. Eisner's USPD was defeated in the January 1919 election, coming in sixth place, with only 3 per cent of the vote, and only garnering three seats in the provincial legislature (the Landtag), while the Bavarian People's Party, which, despite its name, was conservative, got 66 seats. Eisner, apparently because he was loath to give up power, delayed calling the Landtag into session until public pressure from all quarters - including a death threat from the Thule Society if he did not give up his office - forced him to. Finally, he set the legislature to meet on 21 February 1919,Mitcham (1996), p. 31 more than a month after the election.Burleigh, Michael (2000) The Third Reich: A New History, New York: Hill and Wang, p. 40 As he was on his way to the Landtag to announce his resignation, Eisner was shot dead by the right-wing nationalist Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, a decorated aristocratic former cavalryman now a student at the University of Munich, who was a believer in the \\"stab-in-the-back myth\\", which held that Jews, socialists and other undesirable elements had caused Germany to lose World War I. As a Jew, a socialist, a Bohemian, and a Berliner, Eisner was the perfect target. Arco-Valley had been humiliated when a Leftist mob tore off his cockade from his hat after the war, and then endured further humiliation when he was rejected from membership in the anti-Semitic Thule Society because of Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. After the assassination After the shooting, Arco-Valley was saved from lynching on the spot by the fast action of Eisner's secretary, Fechenbach. Instead, he was arrested and taken to Stadelheim Prison where, coincidentally, he was put in the same cell that Eisner had served time in earlier. Despite the assassination of Eisner, the Landtag convened, and Erhard Auer - the leader of the Social Democrats and the Minister of the Interior in Eisner's government - began to eulogize Eisner, but rumours had already begun to spread that Auer was behind the assassination. Acting on these false allegations, Alois Linder, a butcher and saloon waiter, and a member of the Revolutionary Workers' Council who was a fervent supporter of Eisner, shot Auer twice with a rifle, seriously wounding him. This prompted other armed supporters of Eisner to open fire, causing a melee, killing one delegate from the Centre Party and provoking nervous breakdowns in at least two ministers. From this point, there was effectively no government in Bavaria.Burleigh, Michael (2000) The Third Reich: A New History, New York: Hill and Wang, p. 39 Mitcham (1996), p. 32 These events caused unrest and lawlessness in Bavaria, and a general strike was proclaimed by the soldiers' and workers' councils, who distributed guns and ammunition, provoking the declaration of a state of emergency. The assassination of Eisner created a martyr for the leftist cause, and prompted demonstrations, the closing of the University of Munich, the kidnapping of aristocrats, and the forced pealing of church bells. \\"Revenge for Eisner\\" rang through bullhorns in the streets. The support for the Left was greater than ever before, even greater than Eisner himself had been able to garner. For a month, a Central Council (soviet) under Ernst Niekisch held governmental power. Then, on 7 March 1919, the new leader of the Socialists, Johannes Hoffmann, an anti- militarist and former schoolteacher, managed to patch together a parliamentary coalition government, but a month later, on the night of 6‚Äì7 April, Communists and anarchists, energized by the news of a left-wing revolution in Hungary declared a Bavarian Soviet Republic (BSR), with Ernst Toller as chief of state. Toller called on the non-existent \\"Bavarian Red Army\\" to support the new dictatorship of the proletariat and ruthlessly deal with any counter- revolutionary behavior.M√ºhsam, Erich (1929) Von Eisner bis Levin√©, Berlin- Britz: Fanal Verlag p. 47Mitcham (1996), pp. 32‚Äì33 The Hoffmann government fled to Bamberg in Northern Bavaria, which it declared as the new seat of government - although most of the ministers resigned. An attempt by troops loyal to the Hoffmann government to mount a counter-coup and overthrow the BSR was put down on 13 April by the new \\"Red Army\\" created from factory workers and members of the soldiers' and workers' councils. Twenty people died in the fighting. The rival governments then clashed militarily at Dachau on 18 April when Hoffman's 8,000 soldiers met the Soviet Republic's 30,000. After a coup six days into Toller's regime, the Soviet Republic was now lead by three Russian √©migr√©s, including Eugen Levin√©. The BSR forces - led by, of all people, Ernst Toller - was victorious in the first battle at Dachau, but Hoffman made a deal which gave him the services of 20,000 men of the Freikorps under Lt. General Burghard von Oven. Oven and the Frikorps then took Dachau and surrounded Munich, panicking Egilhofer, who had the hostages he was holding executed, despite the efforts of Toller to prevent it. The Freikorps broke through the Munich defenses on 1 May, and, after the execution of at 1,000-1,200 Communists and anarchists, Oven declared the city to have been secured on 6 May, ending the Bavarian Soviet Republic.Mitcham (1996), pp. 34‚Äì35 Active participants in the Freikorps units which suppressed the Bavarian Soviet Republic included many future powerful members of the Nazi Party, including Rudolf Hess.Mitcham (1996) p. 35 The Bamberg Constitution was enacted on 14 August 1919, creating the Free State of Bavaria within the new Weimar Republic. Aftermath The immediate effect of the existence of the People's State of Bavaria and the Bavarian Soviet Republic was to inculcate in the Bavarian people a hatred of left-wing rule. They saw the period in which these two states existed as one of privation and shortages, censorship and restrictions on their freedoms, and general chaos and disorder. It was seen as Schreckenensherrschaft, the \\"rule of horror\\". These feelings were then constantly to be reinforced by right-wing propaganda not only in Bavaria, but throughout the Reich, where \\"Red Bavaria\\" was held up as an object lesson in the horrors of Socialism and Communism. In this way, the radical right was able to provoke and feed the fears of the peasants and the middle-class. The separate strands of Bavarian right-wing extremism found a common enemy in despising the Left, and Bavaria became profoundly \\"reactionary, anti- Republican, [and] counter-revolutionary.\\" The Left itself had been neutralized after the demise of the two socialist states, and in such a way that there continued to be bad blood between the Communist Party (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) that prevented them from working together throughout Germany. This lack of cooperation, with the Communists seeing the Social Democrats as betrayers of the Revolution, and the Social Democrats seeing the Communists as under the control of Moscow, was later to rebound to the advantage of the Nazi Party, since only a parliamentary coalition of the KPD and SPD could have prevented the Nazis from coming to power. Even at the height of their influence in the Reichstag, they did not have enough delegates to resist such a coalition.Burleigh (2000), pp. 40‚Äì41 See also * Aftermath of World War I * German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 * History of Bavaria * Bavarian Soviet Republic References Informational notes Citations Bibliography * Category:Former countries in Europe Category:Former socialist republics People's State of Bavaria Category:Former polities of the interwar period Category:States and territories established in 1918 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1919 People's State of Bavaria Category:History of Munich Category:Aftermath of World War I in Germany Category:German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 ","title":"People's State of Bavaria"},{"id":"54883229","text":"Mario Seidel (born 19 January 1995) is a German footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Kickers Offenbach.

Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp. 38-39.Christian‚Äôs half-brother, Peter Kaufmann, had already had La Chaux-de-Fonds watchmakers as clients: On October 12, 1890, Georges Gallet (1865-1946) and Emil√© Courvoisier (1858-1937) climbed with Peter. Among the frequent financial and many marital unions of these watchmakers, there was a financial merger between Jules Calame and √âmile Courvoisier in 1892. Moreover, Emil√© married Henriette Gallet, whose father L√©on had founded the Mus√©e International d‚ÄôHorlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Georges later donated over 100 timepieces to the collection and served as the Museum‚Äôs director for twenty years.

Like many of his classmates at Harrow School, Winston had developed a keen interest in mountaineering, inspired by Edward Whymper's lantern-side lecture at the school. In fact, after his alpine climbs, Winston had expressed a desire to become a mountaineer in a letter to Harrow's headmaster, J. E. C.

Welldon to Winston‚Äù [Letter, 11. September 1864] Winston S. Churchill: Companion Volume I, Part 1, 1874-1896. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Comp, 1967, p. 520. However, his life-long friend L. S. Amery, with whom he later climbed Monte Rosa,Johannes Andermatten guided Churchill and L. S. Amery to the summit of the Monte Rosa. The Broadwater Collection, Churchill Archives Centre, Churchill College, Cambridge, England: BRDW V 3/2 reported that Winston had suffered from mountain sickness and a badly flayed face.Amery, Leopold Stennett. Days of Fresh Air: Being Reminiscences of Outdoor Life. London: Jarrolds, 1939. These unpleasant experiences probably discouraged Churchill from following a career in mountaineering. On September 21, 1895, Christian Kaufmann (age 24), his brother Peter (age 37), and nineteen-year-old Gordon Tayleur,Gordon Brooke Tayleur (born 1876, the son of Charles Tayleur, 1864-1903, Market Drayton, Shropshire, England) made several climbs with Kaufmann and his half- brother Peter, including ascents of the Mettenberg (Sept. 17, 1895); the Schreckhorn, M√∂nch, Jungfrau, Silberhorn, Wetterhorn (July 1895): Finsteraarhorn (Sept 11, 1895); and two earlier ascents of the Eiger (Aug. 10, 1894; July 27, 1895), calling Christian a ‚Äúplucky and careful guide . . . who is steady, strong and in every way splendid‚Äù (Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 53). Tayleur, a Charterhouse student, and his sister Lilia had befriended Winston Churchill during their August 1894 stay in Grindelwald; a short time later, Tayleur climbed the Monte Rosa with Churchill and their guide, Johannes Andermatten. See Churchill, ‚ÄúWinston to Lady Randolph,\\" p. 514; and Andermatten's F√ºhrerbuch. an Englishman, successfully climbed the Mitteleggi of the Eiger. The event ‚Äúwas watched by guides, residents, and tourists along the whole Grindelwald valley.‚Äù A detailed account appeared in The Times (London): ‚ÄúAll available telescopes and opera-glasses were in requisition, and it is not too much to say that each step taken for nine hours was both seen and noted, so that some even professed to give an exact number.‚ÄùMcCormick, Joseph. ‚ÄúAscent of the Mitteleggi,‚Äù The Times (London) 21 September 1895, 7. Issue 34688. McCormick, Chaplain and Canon of York at Trinity College, Dublin, climbed with Christian Kaufmann on August 29, 1896, a year after writing the article for the Times. McCormick, a close friend and supporter of Edward Whymper, had planned to climb the Matterhorn with Whymper, but bad weather prevented his arrival in Zermatt. Later he officiated at the funeral of the Matterhorn casualties in 1865 and, in April 1906, presided over the marriage of the 66-year-old Whymper to the 23-year-old Edie Lewin. See also Emil Henry. Triumph and Tragedy: The Life of Edward Whymper. Leicester: Matador, 2011. They left Grindelwald in darkness at 3:30 AM, making their way to Alpiglen and crossing the moraine before the steep climb. Tayleur himself remarked on Christian's endurance, especially his ‚Äúwork step cutting was tremendous, requiring seven hours steady cutting.‚Äù Moreover, as they reached the top, they climbed in darkness and came to the final ridge at 11 PM. The identification and registration pages of Christian Kaufmann‚Äôs F√ºhrerbuch certifying him as an official mountain guide in June 1892.At the turn-of-the-century, Kaufmann guided Herbert J. Mothersill (1868-1937) four times, including not only trips in the Bernese Oberhand (Wetterhorn, Schreckhorn, Jungfrau, Finsteraarhorn, Eiger-Mitteleggi, and Silberhorn in 1895 and 1896) but also to Zermatt (Matterhorn, Breithorn, Weishorn, and Rothorn) and Chamonix (Mont Blanc in 1897);\\"New Expeditions in 1897: Monte Rosa District,\\" Alpine Journal (London) 1897, issue 138, p. 523. ironically, after many challenging climbs, Mothersill died after being fatally injured in a traffic accident.\\"In Memoriam: Herbert J. Mothersill (1868--1937),\\" Alpine Journal (London) 49 (1937), pp. 248-267. In 1898, Kaufmann led Charles Alfred Elliott (1835-1911), the former Lt. Governor of Bengal, on a relatively easy climb to the Gleckstein hut and back to Grindelwald. But it was Charles‚Äô brother Julius Marshall Elliott (1841-1869) who had died 29 years earlier, on July 27, 1869, in an accident while climbing the Scheckhorn unroped. Elliott had insisted that the party not be roped together; when the party reached an ar√™te (now called ‚ÄúElliott's Wangli‚Äù), Elliott jumped from a steep icy slope to some rocks but slipped sliding down the mountain to his death. The guide, Franz Biener from Zermatt, could most certainly have saved Elliott, had they been roped together.Zsigmondy, Emil & Wilhelm Paulcke. Die Gefahren der Alpen. M√ºnchen: Bergverlag Rother, 1933, p. 271. While taking a tour of the Grindelwald glacier many years later, Charles‚Äô son Claude made a grim comment as he approached an icy fissure: ‚ÄúMy uncle is down there.‚Äù Julius Marshall Elliott is, in fact, buried in the Grindelwald cemetery. During this period, there are several detailed entries in Kaufmann's F√ºhrerbuch that give insights into his character and the social conditions of the time. In 1899, Dr. Thomas Longstaff‚Äîan accomplished explorer and mountaineer‚Äîclimbed seven weeks with Kaufmann, completing a staggering sixteen ascents in the Bernese, Graian, and Pennine alps.Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp.78-81. Christian Kaufmann was not in Canada in 1899 as has been incorrectly stated elsewhere (see R. W. Sandford. At the Top: 100 Years of Guiding in Canada. Canmore: Association of Canadian Mountain Guides, 1996, p. 10). Longstaff considered himself very lucky to be able to employ Kaufmann, \\"a first-rate guide . . . young, very handsome, refinded, and of quick intelligence . . . a real artist,\\" who brilliantly tackled peaks that he \\"had never seen, much less set foot on.\\" By observing Kaufmann, he says he \\"learned more mountaineering than [he] could have gained by any other means.\\"Longstaff, Tom. This My Voyage. London: John Murray, 1950, pp.17 & 25.Here is Longstaff's entry in Kaufmann' F√ºhrerbuch (Aug. 28, 1899): ‚Äú[We have] traversed the M√∂nch [13,474 ft] from the Little Schiedegg; the Finsteraarhorn [14,022 ft], descending by the Agassiz Joch; the Schreckhorn [13,379 ft] from the Nassihorn [12,300 ft]; the Dom [14,911 ft] from Saas to Randa; the Monte Rosa [15,203 ft] from the Signal Kuppe [14,941 ft] to the Nordend [15,121 ft]; the Matterhorn [14,692 ft] from the Italian hut to Zermatt; the Aig[uille] d'Argenti√®re [12,799 ft] direct from the Col du Chardonnet [10,902 ft], descending by the ordinary route to Montanvert [glacier]; the [Aiguille du] Gr√©pon [11,424 ft]; Mont Blanc [15,774 from the Dome hut to Chamonix. We also ascended the Aig[uille]du G√©ant, 13,166 ft], and the Aig[uille] Verte [13,524 ft], ascending and descending the latter by the Moine ridge.‚Äù (Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 79). Ada (1877-1949) and Elizabeth (born 1878) Crossley from Burnley, England, comment that their climbs were \\"long and difficult [to the Jungfraujoch, the M√∂nch and to the Gross-Schreckhorn], adding that \\"it is only guides of exceptional ability who would undertake it with two ladies.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 87. Daniel P. Rhodes, who later wrote The Pleasure Book of Grindelwald (1911), remarked that Christian is \\"untiring, quick, and cautious\\" and \\"speaks English unusually well.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 86. David Davidson, from August 9 to Sept. 1, 1900, climbed nine peaks in the Oberland (Eiger, M√∂nch, Schreckhorn, Weisshorn) and in the Valais (Col de Bertol, Grandes Dents ridge, Dent Blanche), remarking that \\"on the M√∂nch he [Kaufmann] had to cut steps in hard and very steep ice for 6 consecutive hours, but he worked most cheerfully and untiringly throughout.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp. 89-90. Finally, twenty-year-old Reginald Thomas Collins (1880-1918)--who accompanied Herbert Ashley Gaitskell, a surgeon in London at Guy's Hospital, on a climb of the Grosses Schreckhorn (on October 26, 1900)--is typical of Kaufmann's clients when he calls him \\"a first-class guide.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 96. Reginald Collins died in 1918 on a French battlefield during World War I.\\"Killed in Action . . .,\\" The Times (London) (Sept. 26, 1918), p. 1.

Alpine Club Library Collection. Both Christian and Hans Kaufmann (separately) travelled to Canada in the spring or early summer of 1901 to promote climbing and tourism for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Whereas Hans guided individual parties in Banff National Park, Christian had special company. In Geneva, on May 11, 1901, he had met Edward Whymper, famous mountaineer, writer, illustrator, and conqueror of the Matterhorn. On behalf of the CPR, Whymper had contacted four Swiss guidesAlthough Joseph Bossonney was actually from Chamonix, France, most of the mountaineering literature refers to the four guides as Swiss. (Christian Klucker from Sils; Joseph Pollinger from St. Niklaus; Joseph Bossonney from Chamonix, France; and Christian Kaufmann from Grindelwald) to organize a trip to the Canadian Rockies. As Klucker remarked in his memoir, ‚ÄúThe Whymper climbing team for Canada consisted of two solid catholic, married Josephs and two rebellious, single Christians.‚ÄùPollinger, Josef. Erinnerungen eines Bergf√ºhrers. Z√ºrich: AS Verlag, 2010. / Adventures of an Alpine guide. London: J. Murray, 1932. Through funding from the CPR, Whymper and his guides stayed in luxury at the Hotel de la Post at Blackfriars in London. Moreover, the Alpine Club and the European Manager of the CPR showed the guides great hospitality during their stay in London. However, a social rift between Whymper and his guides became clear when they boarded the ocean liner Australasian in Liverpool on May 23, 1901 (the ship's maiden voyage): Whymper was a saloon passenger; the guides travelled second class.Library and Archives Canada. Immigration Records. ‚ÄúPassenger lists of the Lake Champlain arriving in Quebec, Que. and Montreal, Que. on 1865-1922,‚Äù item 3921. The group arrived in Montreal on June 2, 1901, stayed at the Place Viger Hotel for the night, and left for the Rockies on June 5. The guides travelled in the Colonial rail car, while Whymper and G. W. Franklyn, his photographic assistant, travelled in the sleeping car. The relationship between Whymper and the guides continued to go badly. During the journey, in northern Ontario, for example, there was an issue about a lack of sleeping blankets for the guides, which Whymper failed to remedy. Whymper and Klucker exchanged sharp words; and all four guides were sour at Whymper.Patillo, Roger. The Canadian Rockies: Pioneers, Legends, and True Tales. Victoria, BC: Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 246; Patillo describes not only this incident but Whymper's entire 1901 excursions in Canada in great detail. On June 9, 1901, the mountaineers arrived in Banff at 5:30 AM, after a four-day rail trip from Montreal to Banff by steam train; the entire journey from London to Banff had taken 17 days.Patillo, p. 246 By June 18, 1901, Whymper, G. W. Franklyn, the four guides, the outfitters Bill Peyto and Jack Sinclair headed into the wilderness. Although there were eleven pack-horses, Whymper had not arranged for any porters. This and similar decisions exacerbated the friction between Whymper and his Swiss guides. Whymper ‚Äúexpected them to always be at his beck and call‚Äîattending to his whims and commands and acting like porters and bearers. They, on the other hand, were professional mountaineering guides from the Alps, where porters and apprentice guides carried their heavy loads, set up the camps and did the cooking and clean-up duties. Mountain guides safely guided their clients up and down the mountains. They weren‚Äôt expected to be beasts of burden, cooks, or pot washers.‚ÄùPatillo, p. 256. Humorous mischief: Whymper‚Äôs liquor bottles with a sarcastic sign that reads, \\"The Remains of E. Whymper\\" (1901).Although Whymper was an accomplished alpinist, artist, lecturer, and writer, his social snobbery, belittling attitude, and excessive consumption of alcohol continued to spark clashes with the guides as well as the outfitters, Wild Bill Peyto and Jack Sinclair. During his excursions, Whymper so frequently ordered cases of whiskey and beer that his drinking became legendary; in stark contrast to the abstinence that the Swiss guides had agreed to in their CPR contracts, Whymper excesses became the object of criticism. In fact, one of the surviving camp photographs from 1901 shows a row of liquor bottles on top of the shipping box; below the crate is a sign, sarcastically written by one of the guides or outfitters, that reads, \\"The Remains of E. Whymper.\\" Such humorous mischief allowed the guides to vent their displeasure at their leader's arrogance. Later in mid-August 1901, Whymper's displeasure turned to violence: \\"Suddenly Whymper's right flew out, connecting with Klucker's jaw, and the Swiss hit the dust. In a jiffy it looked as if the whole four of them were going to take a hand in the fray. We yelled at them to stop, and they did.\\"Campbell, Bob, I Would Do It Again. Quoted in Patillo, p. 262. Whymper reacted with indignation, but, after learning that he might face a trial in the wilderness for assault, Whymper walked over to Klucker and apologized. The guides' further displeasure with Whymper came to a climax in late August, so that the guides went on strike. When asked by Whymper to climb Mt. Stephen (10,495 ft) to take measurements, ‚ÄúKaufmann and Pollinger . . . refused to carry . . . the instruments and packs. This was the beginning of an outright revolt by the four guides, and Kaufmann was nominated to be their chief spokesman and negotiator.‚ÄùPatillo, p. 266. Kaufmann drafted certain conditions that should govern the rest of the 1901 expedition, and Whymper reluctantly signed.Nobs, Beat. Vom Eiger in die Rockies: Berner Oberl√§nder Bergf√ºhrer im Dienste der Canadian Pacific Railway. Bern/New York: Lang, 1987. CPR Mount Stephen House in Field was a home base for many mountaineers.During their stay at the CPR Mount Stephen Hotel in Field, British Columbia, Whymper's group met Reverend James Outram (1864-1925), an English Vicar and experienced climber, who had come to Canada with his brother to recover from overwork (\\"a brain collapse\\"). Outram's sojourn in Canada proved to be far from relaxing; he had begun a strenuous series of ascents guided by Christian H√§sler Sr, including Mt. Victoria and Mt. Stephen and first ascents of Mt. Vaux (3,310 m)Mount Vaux at peakfinder.com and Chancellor Peak (3,280 m)Chancellor Peak at peakfinder.com in Yoho National Park. In many ways, he was as demanding as Whymper and was often displeased with his guides. In August, the 36-year-old Outram met the 61-year-old Whymper, and the 21-year-old Kaufmann. Whymper invited Outram to join his well-financed and well-equipped group. The newly formed group made two first ascents: On August 15, 1901, Christian Kaufmann, James Outram, Edward Whymper, Christian Klucker, and Joseph Pollinger climbed Mt. Habel (3,161 m / 10,371 ft)Mount des Poilus at peakfinder.com and, on August 19, 1901, the same group ascended Mt. Collie (3,143 m / 10,312 ft). On August 9, 1901, Kaufmann made a first ascent of The President () with Outram and Pollinger. The day that Kaufmann and Outram climbed four peaks in one day marked the beginning not only of a successful professional partnership but also a strong, respectful friendship. And, although Outram headed south at the end of the season with the Swiss guides Christian H√§sler and Christian Bohren to successfully make a first ascent of the \\"Canadian Matterhorn,\\" Mt. Assiniboine (), his relationship with Christian Kaufmann made mountaineering history. In Canada with James Outram (1902) Christian Kaufmann on Victoria Glacier near the ‚ÄúDeathtrap‚Äù with Mt. Lefroy (left) and Mt. Victoria (right), ca. 1904.Most likely, it was Outram who encouraged Christian Kaufmann to return to Canada a second time in 1902 for more adventurous climbs,Rubi, Rudolf. Vom Bergbauerdorf zum Fremdenort. Im Tal Grindelwald. Vol II. Grindelwald: Sutter, AG, 1986 and that year proved to be the most productive climbing year in their lives. For eight weeks in July and August 1902, Christian Kaufmann guided James Outram to the summits of ten of the highest peaks in Canadian Rockies, including Mt. Columbia (3,747 m / 12,293 ft), the second highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. At times they travelled from 30 to 80 miles away from the railway linesChr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 116. to the base of mountains. In his entry in Kaufmann's F√ºhrerbuch, Outram says that ‚Äúbig climbing commenced on July 19 and between this date & Aug. 26, 10 first ascents of larger peaks were made, several new passes and a considerable quantity of mountain exploration achieved. On all but two occasions Kaufmann & I climbed alone, as my expected companions were unable at the last moment to make the trip, and he is one of a very small number of Swiss guides with whom such an undertaking could be safely carried through, as the conditions were such that only the highest qualities of skill & experience could have achieved‚Äîwith only two on the rope‚Äî without accident or extreme peril on several of the climbs we made. No praise could be too great for his work on Mt. Bryce, whilst on Mt. Forbes and numerous other occasions he had opportunity to demonstrate his quite first-class ability and did so most thoroughly.‚ÄùChr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 117. The listOutram, James. In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies (1923). Calgary: Rocky Mountain Books, 2007, p. 288-291. of first ascents Kaufmann and Outram completed in those six weeks in 1902 is remarkable: July 19: Mt. Columbia (3,747 m / 12,293 ft); a 22-hour expedition with \\"ice & snow work throughout.\\"Outram's quotations from Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp.116-119, and Outram's report in the Canadian Alpine Journal (February 1903). July 24: Mount Lyell (3,498 m /11,476 ft); 8 hrs. ascent. July 30: Mt. KaufmannOutram says that \\"Kaufmann and I made an expedition to a snowy peak ‚Äî for which the name of Mt. Kaufmann is suggested ‚Äî occupying a commanding position between Mt. Lyell and Mt. Forbes\\" (In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies, p. 311). The most likely summit between these two mountains is today‚Äôs Division Mountain (9,910 ft), named by Charles D. Walcott in 1919. It has a ‚Äúdouble-headed\\" summit, which may have been Outram‚Äôs reason for the selection, to honor Hans and Christian Kaufmann. However, this peak did not become Mt. Kaufmann; instead another double peak, between Mount Sarbach and Epaulette Mountain, was suggested by Outram in 1903, and that name (Kaufmann Peaks, 10,200 ft) was officially recognized in 1920 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. (3,021 m / 9,911 ft). July 31: Mons Peak (3,087 m / 10,128 ft); 6 1/2 hrs. ascent. Aug. 04: Mt. Freshfield (3,337 m / 10,948 ft) with J. N. Collie, H. E. M. Stutfield, G. M. Weed, H. Woolley, and Christian's brother Hans Kaufmann. 8 hrs. ascent. Aug. 10: Mt. Forbes (3,612 m / 11,850 ft) with Collie, Stutfield, Weed, Woolley, and Hans; 8¬Ω hrs. Outram and Kaufmann \\"ascented from high bivouac; [Kaufmann doing] \\"some first-class rock work.\\" On the last 2 peaks, Prof. Collie's party with Hans Kaufmann, joined them. Christian led on Forbes and alternately on Freshfield. Aug. 19: \\"Consolation Peak\\" (Fresnoy Mountain, 3,258 m / 10,689 ft) on the Divide Ridge, west of Mt. Lyell: the same evening they made their way by ar√™tes, cliffs to Turret Peak (c. 10,500 ft.) and then to Thompson Pass and finally to their Columbia Camp, 18¬æ hrs.In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies, p. 397 Aug. 21: Mt.

Wilson (3,260 m / 10,700 ft); \\"traversed from end to end; 8¬Ω hrs ascent.\\" Christian Kaufmann climbing in the Canadian Rockies (ca. 1903)Outram's respect for Kaufmann is vividly expressed in his detailed account of climbing Mt. Bryce.Outram, James. In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies. New York: MacMillan Company, 1905, p. 408. On July 21, in preparation of their climb, the two mountaineers left camp, made their way through forests of fallen trees, chopped-down a big spruce to make \\"a bridge across the swift torrent,\\" climbed steep, rugged slopes to \\"delightful\\" lakes, and finally reached an altitude of 8,000 feet in order to \\"survey Mt. Bryce and its approaches . . . with strong field glasses.\\" On August 21, they begin their climb at 4:40 in the morning, roped together before tacking the snow wall, and continued thus throughout the day.\\" One 70 feet high cliff \\"threatened defeat,\\" but \\"Christian immediately led the way: Hold after hold gave way as [Kaufmann] tried them one by one, and fragments rattled down the gully and leapt from rock to rock in ever growing bounds till, lost to sight and sound, they dashed to final rest upon the glacier 6,000 feet below . . . Fortunately Kaufmann is a magnificent rock-climber, and it was a treat to watch the skill and science he displayed in his advance slowly and cautiously towards his goal.\\"Outram, p. 417. Kaufmann, \\"sometimes with arms and legs outstretched, like great starfish,\\" overcame one difficulty after another \\"with cat-like tread, face inwards towards the slope.\\" After reaching the 11,750-foot summit, eleven hours later, at 3:40 PM, they spent little time at the top. But they soon realize that the 70 feet of cliff encountered earlier could not be descended before dark. Rather than freezing without shelter in arctic winds during a night, Kaufmann decided to descend the mountain in darkness. Outram, still roped to his guide, went first, and Kaufmann, in the upper, less secure position, moved cautiously down the rocky cliff. > \\"Drawn out for one long hour of concentrated tension were the successive > experiences of helpless groping in the dark depths for something to rest a > foot upon, of blind search all over the chilled rocky surface for a knob or > tiny crack where the numbed fingers might find another hold, of agonizing > doubt as to their stability when found, of eerie thrill and sickening > sensation when the long-sought support crumbled beneath the stress and > hurtled downward into the blackness of space, whilst the hollow > reverberations of its fall reechoed through the silence.\\"Outram, p.426. As Outram observed, after \\"nearly 17 hours of adventurous companionship,\\" the mountaineers finally unloosened the rope that had bound them together. The outfitter Jimmy Simpson remarked that \\"'Outram wanted all the glory himself' and claimed that he [Outram] treated his guide Kaufmann as 'just help.'\\"Hart, E. J. Jimmy Simpson: Legend of the Rockies. Surrey, BC: Rocky Mountain Books, 2009, p. 34. But these remarks seem doubtful in light of Outram's repeated praise of his guide. In fact, Outram treats Kaufmann's only fault humorously and forgivingly: \\"We looked forward to a good hot supper, when, to our dismay, it was discovered that we were matchless! Christian, probably for the first time in his career, had omitted to bring a single one--a doubly reprehensible oversight for a habitual smoker.\\"Outram, p. 412. Christian & Hans Kaufmann with tent in Prospector's Valley.Just as many of Outram's triumphs were only possible because of Christian Kaufmann's mountaineering skills, the successes of Outram's rival John Norman Collie (1859-1942) were accomplished primarily because of the professionalism of Christian's brother, Hans Kaufmann. Hans also travelled to Canada for eight weeks in July and August 1902 and had been climbing with Collie's group when, in August 1902, the two groups \\"combined forces . . . to attempt Mount Forbes . . . There had been some competition and even animosity between the two when Outram made the first ascent of Mount Columbia following Collie's preparatory exploration of the area. The fine Victorian manners of both gentlemen were demonstrated on this first ascent. At one point Collie, rather than increase the risk to his companions of being the fourth on the rope, abandoned the ascent. After Outram successfully climbed the second cliff, he sent Christian and Hans Kaufmann back down to accompany Collie up the difficult section, feeling that Collie, 'more than all the rest, deserved the gratification and honour of being the first to conquer Mount Forbes'.\\"Birrell, Dave. 50 Roadside Panoramas in the Canadian Rockies. Surrey, BC: Rocky Mountain Books, 2000, p. 43. Christian Kaufmann made additional climbs in 1902 that deserve mention. On May 22, he and Christian H√§sler guided Walter Weston (1861-1940) and his wife Francis (1872‚Äì1937) to the summit of Mt. Stephen; both Westons were experienced mountaineers and are credited with introducing mountain climbing in Japan during the late-nineteenth century.Weston, Walter. Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps. London: J. Murray, 1896; and The Playground of the Far East. London: J. Murray, 1918. Walter commented that Kaufmann's \\"strength & skill are only equalled by his care & attention. He well deserves the place he has gained at the top of the tree of his profession.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 101. Later in the season (September 1902), Kaufmann took George B. Dorr to the top of Mt. Stephan and across Abbott's Pass. Dorr was an active conservationist and noted philanthropist who is credited with the establishment of Acadia National Park. Further climbing in Canada (1903‚Äì1906) Kaufmann made four more trips to Canada for the CPR (1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906). In April 1904, he crossed the Atlantic aboard the Lake Champlain with five fellow guides, Edward Feuz, Christian H√§sler, Christian Bohren, Friedrich Michel, and his brother Hans Kaufmann. In 1905, he travelled with three of the Feuz guides, Edward, Sr.; Edward, Jr.; and Fritz Michael. Finally, in 1906, he sailed with Edward and Gottfried Feuz on the Lake Manitoba. On June 29, 1903, Gertrude Lowthian Bell, the world explorer, climbed with Christian and Hans expressing\\"The F√ºhrerb√ºcher of Hans and Christian Kaufmann,\\" American Alpine Club Journal (1934). regret that the weather at Field, B.C., was so poor that it prevented her from any challenging climbs with Christian, who \\"has done so much pioneering work in this country that it would be difficult to find a better guide.\\" She hoped to meet him again for further climbs in Grindelwald.Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 106. 1903 was another very active year for Christian, including several first ascents: July 16, 1903: Mt. Goodsir (3,567 m / 11,703 ft), the highest peak of the Ottertail group, with Charles E. Fay, Herschel C. Parker, and Christian H√§sler. July 21, 1903: Mt. Hungabee (3,492 m / 11,457 ft) with Herschel C. Parker and his brother, Hans Kaufmann. Sept. 1, 1903: Mt. Deltaform (3,424 m / 11,234 ft) with August Eggers, Herschel C. Parker, and his brother, Hans Kaufmann. Sept. 3, 1903: Mt. Biddle (3,320 m / 10,890 ft) with August Eggers, Herschel C. Parker, and his brother, Hans Kaufmann. Herschel C. Parker (1867-1931), a physicist at Columbia University, enjoyed not only the challenge of his first ascents but also gave a scientific dimension to his climbs with Kaufmann. He commented in Kaufmann's F√ºhrerbuch: \\"On our return from Mt. Hungabee we climbed Mt. Temple from Moraine Lake and made determination of the altitude with the Hypsometer . . . on all the peaks I had the kind interest and assistance of Christian Kaufmann in my scientific observations.\\"Chr.

On June 5, 1904 Christian and Hans Kaufmann guided John Duncan Patterson, later the third president of the Alpine Club of Canada, to a first ascent of high Mount Ball.Mount Ball at peakfinder.com The following month they guided Hudson Stuck, Archdeacon of Alaska and future first ascendant of Denali, on Mt. Victoria. In 1904, at the Chalet Lake Louise, the brothers also met Gertrude Emily Benham, an English mountaineer and traveler, who had climbed many Alpine peaks in her youth with her father. She employed both Kaufmanns and climbed numerous peaks with them: Mts. Lefroy, Victoria, Whyte, Stephen, Temple, Assiniboine, as well as Pope's Peak, Yamnee Peak, Shappee Peak, and an unknown summit; four were first ascents. One of their most strenuous expeditions took place in late August 1904. Leaving Lake Louise at midnight, Benham and the Kaufmanns crossed Abbott Pass, descended to Lake O‚ÄôHara, making their way along Cataract Valley to the summit of Mt. Stephen, reaching the top at 7:30 PM, and, finally, descending after dark to the town of Field, arriving at 3:00 AM, 27 hours after leaving Lake Louise.Benham, Gertrude. ‚Äú‚ÄôThe Canadian Rockies,‚Äô New Expeditions in 1904.‚Äù Alpine Journal (London) 22 (1905), 333-335. The first ascent of Mt. HeejeeThe Valley of the Ten Peaks, visible from Moraine Lake near Lake Louise, consists of ten summits, named from east to west by Samuel Allen in 1894 after the numbers 1 to 10 in the Stoney Indian language: Heejee (#1, now Mt. Fay), Nom (#2 now Mt. Little), Yamnee (#3, now Mt. Bowlen), Tonsa (#4), Sapta (#5 now Mt. Perren), Shappee (#6 now Mt. Allen), Shagowa (#7 Mt. Tuzo), Shakhnowa (#8 now Mt. Deltaform), Neptuak (#9), and Wenkchemna (#10). Although Charles Fay was not the first to climb Heejee (#1), the mountain was still named in his honor. by Christian Kaufmann and Gertrude Benham was more controversial. They set out on July 20, 1904; however, on the same day, Hans Kaufmann and Professor Charles Ernest Fay (1846-1931) also attempted to climb the mountain by a more difficult route. Christian and Benham were successful, but Hans and Fay had to abandon the climb due to snowy conditions. To honor his accomplishments, Fay, a respected mountaineer, had been promised that Heejee Peak (#1) would be named in his honor by the Geographic Board of Canada, and he wanted to be the first to climb the mountain, which was to bear his name. Fay was angered that he had been beaten to the top and suspected that the Kaufmann brothers had played a trick on him. Fay was emphatic that he had been misled: ‚ÄúI should have probably made the first ascent of the new Mt. Fay which I missed by Hans Kaufmann‚Äôs leading me, against my protest, up Consolation Valley, while Christian led Miss Benham around by the familiar ‚ÄòHourglass Couloir‚Äô to its virgin summit.‚ÄùDowling, Phil. The Mountaineers: Famous Climbers in Canada. Edmonton: Hurtig, 1979, p. 29. He accused the Kaufmanns of conspiracy and demanded that the CPR dismiss them. In the end, Hans Kaufmann's contract was not renewed, and, at the end of the 1904 season, he ended guiding in Canada. Christian continued working for the CPR until the end of the 1906 season.Nobs, pp. 161-155. Whether Christian and Hans really did conspire to deny Fay the first ascent of \\"his\\" mountain remains unclear due to a lack of primary evidence.Nobs, p. 163. Birrell does say that ‚Äúthe Kaufmann brothers had a reputation for playing practical jokes.‚ÄùBirrell, p. 86. Indeed, Christian may well have had a role in ‚ÄúThe Remains of Edward Whymper‚Äù prank played on the famous English mountaineer (see above) in 1901. And Edward Feuz, Jr., was convinced about the deception and viewed the two Kaufmann with great disfavor.Kauffman, Andrew J. & William L. Putnam. The Guiding Spirit. Revelstoke, BC: 1986, p.123. However, Feuz‚Äô version of the events should be viewed skeptically, since he may have been jealous of the popularity and successes of the Kaufmanns, especially their independence, genial nature, English fluency, and above-average gratuities from clients.Nobs, pp. 163-165. On September 15, 1904, Henrietta L. Tuzo climbed Mt. Victoria with Kaufmann, saying she hoped ‚Äúto do further ascents with him another season.‚ÄùChr. Kaufmann. F√ºhrerbuch, p.134. And, indeed, she and Christian Kaufmann climbed Mt. Collie (10,315 ft.) on July 12, 1906,M. P. Bridgland, Chief Mountaineer of the Canadian Alpine Club, reported: \\"On July 12th, J. D. Patterson, accompanied by the Swiss guide, Gottfried Feuz, ascended Mt. Collie from a camp pitched the night before at the foot of the Twin falls. The ascent was made by way of the Yoho glacier and the return on the opposite side of Yoho peak, by way of the Twin falls. By a curious coincidence, the peak was climbed on the same day by Miss Henrietta L. Tuzo, a member of the Club, but one who was not visiting the camp. Under the care of the Swiss guide, Christian Kaufmann, she made the ascent by a different route, and the two parties met upon the summit.\\" ‚ÄúReport of the Chief Mountaineer.

Kellas (1907) Sinioichu, Simvo, and Kangchen- junga viewed from the Zemu Glacier near Green Lake where Kellas and Kaufmann camped in 1907. Photo: Vittorio Sella. 1899.After six climbing seasons (1901-1906) in Canada, Christian Kaufmann (with his brother Fritz) travelled to Sikkim, India, in August 1907 to climb with Alexander Mitchell Kellas (1868-1921), a Scottish mountaineer and physiologist who was interested in studying the causes of altitude sickness. Neither Kellas nor the Swiss had been in the Himalayas before, although Kellas was to make seven more trips to the region. The expedition, including the two Kaufmanns, left Srinagar (5,200 ft.) in the Kashmir Valley on August 3, 1907, heading for \\"the most stupendous mountain barrier in the world.\\" Kellas said his objective \\"was to explore the glaciers of Kangchenjunga, and ascend any mountains of the region which might prove accessible.\\" And he wanted to do scientific work \\"in connection with variations in the composition of the atmosphere at high altitudes, and alterations in the relative numbers the red and white corpuscles in blood,\\" what he called \\"mountain lassitude\\" or altitude sickness.Kellas, Alexander Mitchell. \\"The Mountains of Northern Sikkim and Garhwal,\\" The Geographical Journal 40:3 (Sept. 1912), pp. 241-260. After experiencing difficulties crossing the Pir Panjal mountain range and fording the swollen Rembiara River, they crossed Pir Panjal Pass (11,400 ft.) and encountered several other rivers with flood conditions. On August 12, one of the Kaufmanns was \\"unwell\\" and stayed at a \\"rest-house near Naoshera,\\" but he finally returned to Srinagar, while Kellas and the others travelled on to Darjeeling, visiting the Kangchenjunga glacier along the way.Mitchell, Ian R. & George W. Rodway. Prelude to Everest: Alexander Kellas, Himalayan Mountaineer. Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2011, pp. 80-84. On September 8, 1907, the Kaufmanns guided Kellas in an attempt to reach the summit of Simvu (22,800 ft.), but, encountering a snowstorm, they were forced to abandon the climb at 19,000 feet. Two days later they attempted the summit again, but the Kaufmanns again abandoned the ascent, considering the snow too dangerous at 20,700 feet. A third attempt on September 30 that began at 2 AM and involved crossing the Zemu glacier by moonlight was also abandoned because of deep, soft snow and inclement weather at 20,000 feet. In his various reports to the Alpine Club (London), Kellas says that the Kaufmanns turned back because of heavy snow and storms. Although he later explains that the Swiss guides were unsatisfactory,Rudolf Rubi comments that the relationship between the Kaufmanns and Kellas in Sikkim was not optimal (p. 216). he never directly says the Kaufmanns suffered from altitude sickness; however, Himalaya summits are predominantly over 20,000 feet, and the Kaufmanns were accustomed to heights of 10,000 to 16,000 feet, so that Swiss guides were not as acclimatized to such heights as the native sherpas. In the Bernese and Pennine Alps (1908‚Äì1911) Christian Kaufmann (middle) and clients enjoy a mountain-side meal during a climb.Many of Kaufmann's clients used his services as a guide on repeated occasions. Freeman Allen (1870-1930), for example, climbed with Kaufmann in the Canadian Rockies (e.g., Mt. Victoria), the Bernese Oberland (e.g., Jungfrau and M√∂nch in June1908, with Christian's brother Fritz Kaufmann),Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp. 145. and the seven weeks (from June 20 to August 10, 1909) in the Valais, ascending 9 peaks, including Monte Rosa, Lyskamm, and Aigille du Gr√©pon.Chr.

The Sanders family‚ÄîHarry, Jack, Cathi, and Helen‚Äîfrom London made rigorous climbs with Kaufmann in 1908 and 1909. On June 26, 1908, Ethel Reddan (Hampstead, London), a member of the Ladies Alpine Club, climbed the Wetterhorn as well as the Little and Big Schreckhorn with Kaufmann.Reddan bequested ¬£64,000 to the British Museum upon her death in 1957. The Times (London,) March 2, 1960, p. 12 On April 20, 1911, thirty-nine-year-old Christian Kaufmann married Emma Christen (born 1881 in Herzogenbuchsee). They later had three children: Johann (1914, died in infancy), Hans Wilhelm (1916-1942), and Christian Alexander. In Switzerland and Norway with J. W. S. Brady (1911‚Äì1912) As Kaufmann's client \\"for almost the whole summer\\" on more than 25 exploits in the Bernese and Pennine Alps, John W. S. BradyJohn William Stansbury Brady (born 1889 in Baltimore, MD) was married to Dorothy Wendell of Boston in 1916, received his medical degree in 1917, served in the transport service during World War I (1918-1919), and practiced medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital. An avid mountaineer, he had climbed the Gross Lauteraarhorn and Mont Blanc with Christian Kaufmann in August 1911. Alpine Journal 26: 195-198 (1912), pp. 83, 176, 348-349. from Baltimore filled several pages (October 15, 1911) in Kaufmann's F√ºhrerbuch. In July 1911, Christian's brother Hans joined Brady in a climb of the Klein Scheckhorn over the Upper Grindelwald Glacier of the Lauteraarsattel-Route.\\"Neue Bergfahrten in den Schweizeralpen,\\" Die Alpen (1911): \\"Klein Schreckhorn √ºber den Nordgrat. 4.

Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp. 162-164. Although the weather was not favorable that year, Christian guided Brady to two Norwegian summits: Ruten (4974 ft) (Oppland) near Fefor, Nautgardstind (7,600 ft.) near Bessheim. During that summer, they also climbed five peaks in the Maderanertal in the Canton Uri: Gross Windg√§llen (10, 459 ft.), Oberalpstock (10,919 ft.), Claridenstock (10,722 ft.), Scheerhorn (10, 810 ft.), Gross Ruchen (10,265 ft); and, in the South Tyrol, the two highest peaks of the Ortler Alps, K√∂nigspitz (12,655 ft.) and Ortler (12, 811 ft.). Later climbs (1913‚Äì1930) At the age of 41, Christian Kaufmann reduced his climbing activities. The entries in his F√ºhrerbuch are limited to climbs in the Bernese Oberland, and, with the completion of the railway to the Jungfraujoch in 1912, Kaufmann and other guides began their tours at the 11,332-foot rail terminus. Otto (New York City) and Robert P. Koenig (Cambridge, Mass.), for instance, began their August 1925 tour across the Aletschglacier to the Konkordia Hut and the Finsteraarhorn summit from the rail station.Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, pp. 170-171. Kaufmann continued to receive praise as a careful, first-rate guide and a pleasant, entertaining companion, who proved to be \\"an excellent teacher of beginners.\\"Chr. Kaufmann, F√ºhrerbuch, p. 175. Appropriately enough the last testimony in the F√ºhrerbuch (June 18, 1930) by Arthur Burton mentions Kaufmann's \\"son, the younger Christian, [who] took Mrs. Burton and me to the top of the Jungfrau and then on to the Concordia Hut and the Eggishorn.\\"Chr.

Moreover, there are entries in Alpine publications indicating that he was still actively climbing two years before his death. In fact, in July 1937, at age 64, he was snowed-in for 36 hours at the Dossen hut with his client Claude Wilson. As H√§sler notes in his tribute to Kaufmann, \\"It was the last walk in the mountains for both of them.\\"H√§sler, p. 131. Kaufmann and his family had lived in Grindelwald, auf dem Hubel, but moved closer to the village (Sp√§tenmatte) in 1930. H√§sler recalls that he \\"met Christen Kaufmann in late autumn of 1938, smiling and as merry as ever, tramping down a dripping hillside at Grindelwald, under a big blue umbrella.\\"H√§sler, p.132. Kaufmann died on January 12, 1939. His death was announced in a New York Times obituary: \\"Christian Kaufmann, Swiss guide, who was well-known in Canada for his mountain-climbing feats died at the age of 66. He also took part in expeditions in the Himalayas.\\"\\"Christian Kaufmann.\\" Obituary. New York Times (January 24, 1939). Funeral services were held on January 15, 1939, and Christian was laid to rest in the Grindelwald cemetery.

Pushing the Limits: Story of Canadian Mountaineering. Calgary: Rocky Mountain Books, 2000, p. 65. but also among the greatest of Alpine climbers. He received not only the praise of accomplished mountaineers for this unparalleled knowledge, strength, and endurance but also the respect of novices for his patience and teaching skills. In an age, when mountaineering was ‚Äúa demonstration of masculinity‚Äù and when men feared that the ‚Äúweaker sex‚Äù might \\"prove themselves capable of the same feats,\\"Runggaldier, Ingrid.

Kaufmann gave women climbers equal social and professional recognition. He welcomed female climbers and thereby advanced their struggle toward gender equality. In recognition of his superior mountaineering and many first ascents in Canada, Christian was honored by having several Canadian landmarks officially named in his honor. In 1903, James Outram suggested that a mountain with twin summits in the lower Mistaya valley of Alberta be officially called the Kaufmann PeaksSee Note 38, above. in honor of Christian (10,200 ft.) and Hans (10,151 ft.). Professor Herschel C. Parker of Columbia University proposed that a lake west of Chimney Peak in British Columbia be named Kaufmann Lake; they had camped overnight at this lake while ascending Mount Deltaform in 1903.See Appalachia 10 (1902-1904), p 294. Finally, in Alberta, there is a smaller Kaufmann Lake near Kaufmann Creek, a tributary steam that flows into the Mistaya River near Saskatchewan River Crossing.

Shaffer (1885‚Äì1964), with whom she built a flying machine. In 1911, Cleve T. Shaffer was the leading aviation figure of his country. He was one of the first five members of The Planetary Society, founder of the National Tank Defense League and honorary President of the San Francisco Soaring Society. He was the owner of \\"Tai Shan\\", a country estate near Los Gatos, California. On August 22, 1909, Geneve Shaffer flew Cleve's airplane in the San Bruno hills near San Francisco. For this ascension, the Smithsonian Institution regards Shaffer as the first woman glider pilot in the United States. During one of her ascensions she made the first aerial photographs of Oakland and San Francisco. She also worked with Cleve in his Shaffer Aero Manufacturing Co., serving as secretary and chief rigger. In autumn 1909, Geneve was co-pilot of balloonist Ivy Baldwin of the balloon \\"The Pride of San Francisco\\", but the balloon crashed down in the water. After that Geneve gave up aviation. Shaffer traveled all over the world and was a Hearst correspondent in the Orient. Shaffer lectured in India, Australia, in the northern part of Africa and in many European countries. As a realtor, she specialized in skyscrapers. In 1934, Mary Margaret McBride, NEA Service Staff Correspondent, called her \\"record-breaking California's outstanding woman realtor\\" in occasion of Shaffer visit to the East for a 10 million dollar construction deal. She was said to be the only woman skyscraper builder in the country, and followed all the process, from the buying of the land to the renting of the spaces.

The case is popularly known in Spain as the Disappearance of Marta del Castillo (Desaparici√≥n de Marta del Castillo) or simply as the Marta del Castillo Case (Caso Marta del Castillo).

Carca√±o admitted that he had seen her that evening, but claimed that he had left her at the entrance of her apartment block around 21:30. Del Castillo's mother was suspicious and told Carca√±o that she'd \\"throw the police over\\" him if something bad had happened to her daughter. Carca√±o attracted further suspicions from Del Castillo's family and friends when he moved immediately to nearby Camas, rather than joining the search for Del Castillo. Carca√±o resided from then on in Camas with his latest girlfriend, 14-year old Roc√≠o P. G., and her family. Among other places, Del Castillo's friends looked for her in the apartment where Carca√±o had lived before with his older half-brother, Francisco Javier Delgado Moreno, in Seville's 78 Le√≥n XIII Street, and they noticed that the place smelled strongly of bleach and ammonia. Del Castillo's family reported her disappearance to the police around 2:00 AM. Investigation The case was investigated by the Underage People Task Force (Grupo de Menores) of the Spanish National Police. After Carca√±o's confession, it was joined by the Homicide Task Force (Grupo de Homicidios). Carca√±o denied his involvement in repeated interrogations, but P. G. claimed to have seen blood on Carca√±o's pants, and the lining of Carca√±o's jacket tested positive for Del Castillo's blood. A luminol test in Le√≥n XIII also revealed a large bloodstain on the bedroom floor. =Carca√±o's first version of the murder= Carca√±o was interviewed again on February 14. Upon hearing of P. G.'s testimony and the existence of forensic evidence, he collapsed and confessed to the murder. According to this testimony, Carca√±o murdered Del Castillo during an argument on the night of January 24. The reason for the argument was Carca√±o's relationship with P. G. and Del Castillo's threat to tell P. G. about her own continued relationship with Carca√±o if he didn't stop seeing her. The murder weapon was a heavy ashtray which was never found, but that Carca√±o claimed to have used to hit Del Castillo on the left side of the parietal bone, killing her. Carca√±o also claimed to have called a friend, Samuel Ben√≠tez P√©rez, from a payphone in Le√≥n XIII Street, and to have requested his help moving the body to Camas. Once there, they threw the body in the Guadalquivir River near a point called Charco de la Pava. Police suspected that Carca√±o was not telling the whole truth. Among other things, he claimed that the vehicle used to move the body was his own moped, but tests showed that it was not stable enough to transport three people in that area, even without accounting for one of them being dead. =Arrests= On February 16, the Minister of the Interior Alfredo P√©rez-Rubalcaba announced that Carca√±o and Ben√≠tez were both arrested under charges of homicide and illegal detention. Also arrested were Carca√±o's half- brother and a 15-year old friend of Carca√±o and Ben√≠tez, later identified as Francisco Javier Garc√≠a Mar√≠n, alias \\"El Cuco\\". =Guadalquivir River search= Bridges across the Guadalquivir River in Seville. 218 officers of the Police's Special Operations Group, the Civil Guard's Underwater Specialist Groups, and the Military Emergencies Unit searched the Guadalquivir between Camas and the stuary at Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, using 22 vessels, 3 jet skis, 2 helicopters, 13 scent hounds, and a sonar and specialized underwater body retrieval technology lent by the Dutch Police. A Gelves dock engineer also designed, built and volunteered a rake-like tool capable of removing mud from the bottom of the river. Three separate tests with pig carcasses weighing 50 kilograms were made. The bodies submerged several times, but in all three cases, they ended on the surface and stuck in a particular stretch of riverbank that was only 20 kilometers long. However, no trace of Del Castillo was found. Police worked with the hypothesis that the large volume of the Guadalquivir in January and the three weeks between the murder and Carca√±o's confession had been enough to either wash the body out to sea before the search began or to entomb it in the bottom mud, which can be two meters thick in some areas. Also searched were over 40 wells, canals, sewage plants, and pipes. A \\"bloodstained cloth\\" found in an irrigation canal near Camas was revealed to be just painted red after testing. =\\"El Cuco\\"'s version= In his own testimony (later recanted), \\"El Cuco\\" stated that he arrived in Le√≥n XIII with Ben√≠tez, where they found Carca√±o wrapping Del Castillo's body in a blanket under the supervision of Delgado. Delgado then threatened him and his family to silence him and stayed at the apartment to clean the evidence while the other three disposed of the body. Police believed that Delgado planned the strategy to follow after the murder, based on this testimony and phone conversations between Carca√±o and Delgado while both were in remand. In one conversation, Delgado told Carca√±o to \\"say nothing, because the police has nothing.\\" =Carca√±o's second version= On March 18, during the customary reconstruction of the crime at Leon XIII, Carca√±o surprised the Police when he requested to recant his previous testimony and make a new one. In this second statement, Carca√±o blamed the murder on \\"El Cuco\\", saying that he had strangled Del Castillo in Delgado's living room while Carca√±o was in the bedroom under the influence of \\"substances\\". Afterward, he phoned Ben√≠tez and they disposed of the body in a dumpster in the cross between Le√≥n XIII and Jorge de Montemayor streets. Carca√±o claimed that he had felt pressured by the Police to make his first testimony. Following this second testimony, the other three accused were requested to make new statements of their own, and they were confronted with Carca√±o and each other to study their reaction. Ben√≠tez and \\"El Cuco\\" claimed to not be involved at all, and to not have visited Delgado's apartment on the day of the crime. \\"El Cuco\\"'s lawyer called Carca√±o's second statement a joke and remarked the innocence of his client. Also critical was Del Castillo's father Antonio, who accused the suspects of being deliberately misleading about the body's location because they were hiding additional crimes against his daughter. Del Castillo speculated that his daughter had been cremated in an incinerator where P. G.'s father had been employed in previously. Because of Carca√±o's new statement, the search team was alerted and directed from the river to the Montemarta-C√≥nica landfill near Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra, where the trash generated in Seville is processed. =Carca√±o's third version= On March 19, confronted with the \\"unbelievability\\" of the crime reconstruction in Le√≥n XIII, Carca√±o requested to recant and make yet another statement before the examining magistrate. This time, Carca√±o said that he had been drinking, smoking and taking drugs with Del Castillo and \\"El Cuco\\" at Le√≥n XIII. Around midnight, the two males attempted to have sex with Del Castillo, and when she resisted, they beat her and took her to the bedroom, where they threatened her with a navaja and Carca√±o raped her, followed by \\"El Cuco\\". Afterward, they tied her to the bed with insulating tape and an extension cord. Carca√±o punched her hard enough to make her bleed, and they strangled her together. The body was disguised with two trash bags, moved out of the apartment on a wheelchair previously used by Carca√±o's dead mother, and thrown in the dumpster while \\"El Cuco\\" disposed of the navaja on a sewer. Though authorities were not entirely convinced by this version, it explained the finding of the navaja in the sewer in front of the apartment, the presence of Del Castillo's blood and DNA of both Carca√±o and \\"El Cuco\\" in the bedroom, the finding of cells belonging to both Carca√±o and Del Castillo in the wheelchair's handlers, and the testimony of a neighbor who had met Carca√±o when he returned to the building with the empty wheelchair. Witnesses to the statement claimed that Carca√±o had looked the magistrate in the eye for the first time and appeared to have taken a load off his mind after he was finished. Carca√±o's lawyer renounced to continue representing him after this point. When asked about why he had implicated Ben√≠tez and said that he had disposed of the body in the river, he claimed that he had told the Police what they wanted to hear back then. He also denied any involvement from his half-brother, whom he claimed had left the apartment at 20:30, ten minutes after Carca√±o arrived there with Del Castillo. Carca√±o also denied having talked about the murder with P. G., in contradiction with her own testimony, which stated that he had told her \\"everything.\\" It was estimated that in the time between the disappearance and Carca√±o's new version, around 65,000 tons of trash had arrived at the landfill. As a result, it would be \\"very difficult\\" to locate the body. Landfill employees and policemen revised 60,000 tons over the course of 32 days unsuccessfully, even though they knew a particular area where the trash was dumped in the days following the murder. They also found no human DNA in the dumpsters that Carca√±o had said were used to dispose of the body. Eventually, Police concluded that Carca√±o had not thrown the body in a dumpster, and speculated that he had falsely confessed a rape with the intention of obtaining a bench trial rather than a trial by jury. =Provisional release of Delgado, Ben√≠tez and \\"El Cuco\\"= On May 21, Delgado was released with the condition that he visited the courthouse every Monday. Reasons included the fact that Delgado's part in the crime was necessarily small if any, and that his alibi had been partly confirmed by mobile phone tracking placing him on the road to Carmona at 21:01. Delgado, who had always denied his involvement, offered to take a polygraph test, but the magistrate rejected the idea. After his release, Delgado made a press statement accusing his half-brother of lying to him, and about his involvement in the case. Ben√≠tez was released on December 10. He had requested to be released on two previous occasions, but he was denied arguing gravity of the suspected crime and a risk of tampering with evidence after release. \\"El Cuco\\", being under 18 years of age, was recluded in a juvenile detention center for the maximum legal time (9 months), and moved to a supervised home afterward. =Evidence in vehicles owned by the family of \\"El Cuco\\"= A Volkswagen Polo Mk4. \\"El Cuco\\" first claimed that the trio used his mother's Volkswagen Polo to move the body from Le√≥n XIII to the Guadalquivir. This car was washed a few days after Del Castillo's disappearance, but it tested positive for blood in luminol and benzidine tests. However, no DNA could be extracted from the blood as it was too degraded. Police also found the DNA of a man and a woman in the car, which belonged to neither the victim nor the suspects. It was assumed to belong to \\"El Cuco\\"'s mother and her boyfriend, but neither agreed to provide a DNA sample for comparison. In December, it was discovered that a Renault 19 and a Ford Escort abandoned since August on Seville's streets, with flat tires and no license plates, also belonged to \\"El Cuco\\"'s mother and her boyfriend, contradicting their claims that they only owned the Polo. The Renault was retired and destroyed on November 27, before the discovery was made, but the Ford could be retrieved for testing. DNA of a man and a woman that was neither Del Castillo nor any of the accused was found in the Ford. The female DNA belonged to the same woman as the DNA in the Polo. Trials =Pre-Trial Hearing= A pre-trial hearing was held on March 13, 2010. Roc√≠o P. G., who faced no charges, was declared for an hour and a half. She said that Carca√±o had told her that he had thrown Del Castillo's body in a wooded area near Camas. Previously, she had claimed that he had buried it in a ditch some 600 meters from this new location, which led to two unsuccessful searches there earlier in the year. P. G. also stated that Carca√±o had not been at her home in the night of the crime, as he had claimed, but that he had left his cell phone there, explaining why mobile phone tracking data placed him there at the time. When questioned about a threatening call that she had received during the investigation, she denied that she had identified Francisco Javier Delgado as the maker of the call, and remarked that she had merely picked his voice among several anonymous recordings played to her by Police. Journalists speculated that this clarification was a result of P. G. feeling intimidated after Delgado sued her for perjury in the week leading to the hearing. Nevertheless, P. G. cast doubt on her own reliability as a witness when she nonchalantly claimed to have lied to Police and flaunted that \\"If I lie to Police, I [can] lie to anyone,\\" in a statement found baffling by the present. P. G.'s mother and grandmother also testified in regard to their three-week cohabitation with Carca√±o in the family home. At the end of her declaration, P. G. walked pass Carca√±o and suffered a panic attack. Carca√±o declined to make a new statement. The judge only questioned him once, in regards to the location of Del Castillo's body. Carca√±o lowered his head and said, \\"I don't know.\\" The last person to testify was the mother of \\"El Cuco\\", who said that her son had no access to her car because she kept the only existing key. =Ordinary Court Trial= The first trial, presided by Judge Francisco de As√≠s Molina, began on April 12, 2010. Miguel Carca√±o was charged with two instances of rape, one of murder, one of the crimes against moral integrity and one of corpse desecration. Francisco Javier Delgado, his girlfriend Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Mendaro, and Samuel Ben√≠tez each faced a charge of concealment of a crime, corpse desecration and crimes against moral integrity, with Delgado receiving an additional charge for making threats. The prosecution's version of the crime largely followed Carca√±o's third version of the murder, with the differing claim that Delgado and Garc√≠a made it to the apartment after Ben√≠tez and were involved in the disposal of the body. It also mentioned \\"El Cuco\\" as one of the main perpetrators, who was to be tried separately in juvenile court. The prosecution requested a sentence of 52 years in prison for Carca√±o, eight for Delgado, and five for Ben√≠tez. It also requested all four adults to pay the expenses of the unsuccessful search for the body and to compensate Del Castillo's parents with 160,000 euro and each of her sisters with 30,000 euro. In addition, Ben√≠tez should stay away from Del Castillo's family and not contact them for six years after his incarceration. On February 1, 2011, Carca√±o testified before Court, stating this time that Del Castillo wasn't raped, he killed her alone with the ashtray and stayed in Le√≥n XIII to clean up the crime scene while Ben√≠tez and \\"El Cuco\\" disposed of the body in the river. On October 18, Carca√±o added that he had falsely accused \\"El Cuco\\" of rape and murder in vengeance for \\"El Cuco\\" implicating Delgado in the murder and that Ben√≠tez and \\"El Cuco\\" did not arrive until after the murder had already happened. Delgado claimed that he left the house without ever meeting Del Castillo or knowing that she was in a relationship with his brother; that Carca√±o's bedroom door was closed when he left and he didn't look inside; and that he was with his ex-wife and daughter between 21:00 and 23:30, in his pub until 2:00, and in a bar until 4:00 when he called Garc√≠a to let him in the apartment. He denied to have threatened anyone or to know where the body was, but he refused to explain what he meant when he was heard saying \\"There is nothing to look for\\" in the aftermath of Del Castillo's disappearance. Garc√≠a testified that she asked Delgado's permission to study in his home and that she went there after driving Delgado to his pub around 23:50. She claimed to have never seen Del Castillo or her body, but that she smelled something strange behind Carca√±o's door, which was closed. She then retracted this last statement. She denied accusations that her testimony was intended to fabricate an alibi for Delgado. Ben√≠tez testified that he never was at Le√≥n XIII and had no involvement in the crime, attributing his original confession to have helped dispose of the body to Police pressure. \\"El Cuco\\", already convicted in his own trial, testified as a witness on the ordinary trial on October 26. He claimed to not know where the body was and that his early confessions of helping in the disposal of the body were lies made due to police pressure and their threat to implicate his mother and other relatives. On November 3, Roc√≠o P. G. testified that Carca√±o had told her about how he and Delgado had murdered Del Castillo during an argument, cleaned the murder scene, disposed of the body with \\"two others\\" in the wooden area near Camas, and entered her home through a window in the early morning. He also took her to the wooden area, but she wasn't sure if he was telling the truth. She explained inconsistencies in her previous versions with the claim that she had been threatened. P. G.'s mother testified that Carca√±o had murdered Del Castillo but had no part in the body disposal, and explained her daughter's inconsistencies due to being both afraid and in love with Carca√±o. The early witness statement by P. G.'s grandmother, who had died before the trial proper started, was read again. It stated that she had washed Carca√±o's clothes in the morning and found nothing strange in them. Antonio T. D., a barman in Le√≥n XIII, testified that he saw two thin individuals in hoodies pushing a wheelchair with a large package to the dumpsters, around 2:00 AM, and then returning with the wheelchair empty. Delgado's ex-wife testified that he was with her and their daughter between 21:15 and 23:30. Jordi Gonz√°lez, host of 'La Noria'. On November 14, a taxi driver testified as a surprise witness for the prosecution, claiming he drove Delgado to Le√≥n XIII \\"in the first hours of the morning\\", thus contradicting the testimonies of Delgado and Garc√≠a. When asked why he didn't come forward until the week before, he said that he didn't realize the value of his testimony before then. \\"El Cuco\\"'s father testified that he sent home his son early and that while he did not check if he was there, as he was at work, his wife did. \\"El Cuco\\"'s mother said that she arrived home at 1:30 AM and saw her son asleep in his room. Her testimony was polemic because she had repeatedly requested to delay or cancel it claiming illness, yet she had been interviewed the week before in Telecinco's prime-time talk show La Noria and paid for it. In response, Telecinco was subjected to a boycott by viewers and all sponsors pulled out of the show, leading to the relegation of the program to the early morning and its eventual cancelation. On January 16, 2012, Carca√±o was sentenced to 20 years in prison and to compensate Del Castillo's parents and sisters with 340,000 euro for the murder; he was acquitted of every other charge. All other accused were acquitted of all charges citing lack of evidence. The sentence stated that Carca√±o had disposed of the body with the help of \\"El Cuco\\" (convicted in his own trial) and a third, unknown person, but the evidence identifying such person as Ben√≠tez was deemed insufficient. =Juvenile Court Trial= \\"El Cuco\\"'s trial began on January 24, 2011. The presiding judge was Alejandro Vi√°n. \\"El Cuco\\" stood charges for rape, murder and a crime against moral integrity due to his prevention of Del Castillo's receiving a funeral; he plied innocence and claimed to not know the location of the body, blaming his four previous confessions to have concealed the murder on Police's pressures. Carca√±o, Delgado, Ben√≠tez, and Garc√≠a were called to testify as witnesses, while \\"El Cuco\\"'s father declined to testify. The prosecution requested six years of internment in a juvenile detention center, three under supervised freedom, and a 616,319 euro fine, the cost of the unsuccessful search for Del Castillo's body. On March 24, 2011, \\"El Cuco\\" was found guilty of the charge of concealment and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention center and one month of supervised freedom. The verdict allowed \\"El Cuco\\"'s past interment to be counted as part of his sentence, meaning that he would be released less than a year after the trial. He was found innocent of the charges of rape and murder, and not liable to pay for the expenses incurred during the unsuccessful search for the body. The verdict caused controversy because it relied on the identity of Carca√±o as the main perpetrator, even though this wasn't proven yet since Carca√±o's own trial had not finished. =Supreme Court ruling= Citing contradictions and \\"illogical\\" assumptions on the Ordinary Court ruling, the prosecution requested that the sentence be overturned by the Supreme Court of Spain and a new trial take place. This was rejected by the Supreme Court and the verdicts were upheld, but Carca√±o's sentence was changed after considering that his ever-changing statements about the murder and fate of the body went beyond his right to not testify and incriminate himself. These had caused unnecessary, additional grief to the relatives of Del Castillo and constituted a crime against moral integrity. As a result, Carca√±o was given an additional one-year and three months in prison, and he was also fined with the cost of the unsuccessful searches estimated on 616,319 euro and 27 cents. Aftermath =Continued searches= In 2013, Carca√±o told Police that Delgado was the real, and only murderer of Del Castillo. According to this new version (the sixth), Delgado pistol-whipped Del Castillo with his security guard's firearm after she tried to intervene in a fight between the brothers, and they subsequently buried the body together in a farm of La Rinconada called \\"La Majaloba\\", returning 24 hours later to cover the remains with lime. When asked why he had not said any of that earlier, Carca√±o replied that he was afraid of his brother. The prosecution considered the story unbelievable and journalists noted obvious parallels with the killing of Lasa and Zabala by the paramilitary group GAL. Following Delgado's new interrogation, the judge cleared him and criticized the Police for questioning Carca√±o for a crime he was already convicted of. Despite general scepticism, La Majaloba was searched months later and no trace of a body was found. In 2014, search operations were made in an illegal dumpsite located near the road used by Carca√±o to move between Seville and Camas, and not far from the river shore where he claimed to have thrown the body in his first version. The new location was deemed promising according to the results of a P300 study Carca√±o was subjected to in Zaragoza's university hospital. While human bone fragments were recovered at the site, they belonged to three or more people who had died between 100 and 200 years before. Carca√±o reiterated his last version before Court, insisting that the body was in La Majaloba, not the dump, and saying that he didn't understand why the Police were searching there. In 2015, Antonio del Castillo offered Carca√±o 18,000 euro if he pinpointed the exact location of the body, with the promise that he would not seek additional charges against him and that he could spend it in Seville or wherever he wished, after his incarceration. Carca√±o rejected the offer, saying that it wouldn't \\"make up for him.\\" =\\"√ìscar\\"'s claims= On September 7, 2015 Antena 3's Espejo P√∫blico interviewed a man with the pseudonym \\"√ìscar\\", who claimed to be a police consultant infiltrated for the past two and a half years in the circle of \\"El Cuco\\", and who had 600 hours of conversations with them on tape. The interviewee claimed that when Carca√±o and \\"El Cuco\\" transported the body on the wheelchair, they did not bring it to the dumpster or the river, as they had claimed, but to another apartment where it was dismembered with the help of a friend of Carca√±o who wasn't Spanish. It was then taken out in different bags, whose fate was ignored by Carca√±o, thus explaining his incapability to locate the body exactly. The same source claimed that \\"El Cuco\\"'s family felt \\"no sadness nor empathy\\" for Del Castillo's family, that they laughed about the unsuccessful search for the body, and that they had considered having someone beat up Del Castillo's mother and grandfather. On October 29, the examining magistrate accepted the tapes as potential evidence. Some seconds were played in Espejo P√∫blico, revealing that \\"El Cuco\\"'s mother had helped create an alibi for her son, and that she was worried about the possibility that he had raped Del Castillo and that \\"El Cuco\\"'s father might compromise his case by talking too much. \\"√ìscar\\" also said that \\"El Cuco\\"'s mother \\"may have\\" helped in the disposal of the body by lending her vehicle, that \\"El Cuco\\" was silent because he wanted to protect his mother, and that he had proof of Delgado's involvement in the murder. In January 2016, \\"√ìscar\\" was publicly identified by Police as Pablo Bonilla R., a common criminal and one of many people who had tried to infiltrate themselves into the high-profile case. It was denied that he ever worked for Police in any capacity, and the tapes were dismissed as a hoax. These revelations were made during a trial against both the parents of \\"El Cuco\\" and Bonilla himself for breaking the restraining order that forbid \\"El Cuco\\" from getting within 50 kilometers of Seville. Bonilla, charged for driving the car used by \\"El Cuco\\" and his family to travel to Seville, claimed that he had alerted Police about the family's intentions, and that Police had told him to drive them into the road control where they were arrested. Bonilla's claims were dismissed and all three accused were sentenced to pay small fines. On March 16, 2016, the Del Castillo family sued \\"El Cuco\\" and his parents for false testimony at the ordinary court trial, which happened when \\"El Cuco\\" was already of age and legally liable. As their evidence, they cited other witness testimonies, the dismissed tapes, and TV statements of the parents claiming that they lied to create an alibi for their son. \\"El Cuco\\"'s family rejected the tapes both as a forgery and illegally taken, and refused to testify in the new trial. =2017 Guadalquivir search= Judge Molina ordered a new search in a section of the Guadalquivir on February 7, 2017, after receiving a report commissioned by Antonio del Castillo. The area, placed a 10-minute walk away from Le√≥n XIII, and near the Cartuja rowing and kayak center, was identified as the likely location of the body disposal by criminologist Ignacio Abad and geophysicist Luis Avial, who used a georadar to locate 16 \\"exogen\\" points on the river bed susceptible of being the body. The area was consistent with the testimony of a nurse in the Virgen Macarena University Hospital, who claimed to have seen three men in black hoodies pushing a wheelchair. When they stopped, the \\"very little one\\" was approached by a couple who talked to him. The search ended on February 24 after finding unrelated objects only. The same day, Antonio del Castillo met Carca√±o in Herrera de la Mancha prison. Carca√±o claimed that he didn't know the location of Del Castillo's daughter and that it was his brother who disposed of the body. This time, he claimed that Delgado transported the body in his ex-wife's car and that he buried it in a farm of La Algaba. He added that Delgado had probably dug it up later and reburied it elsewhere. Carca√±o also claimed that he was threatened by Delgado into accompanying him to dispose of the body, but that he barely collaborated and fled as soon as he could. As for his ever- changing versions of the murder, he claimed that he always followed the advice of his brother.

He was nephew of Serbian Petriarch Makarije Sokoloviƒá (1557‚Äì1571). During the patriarchal tenure of his cousin Antonije I (1571‚Äì1574), Gerasim became Metropolitan of Herzegovina. When Patriarch Antonije died in 1574, Metropolitan Gerasim was elected new Serbian Patriarch, with residence in the Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá. In that time, his other cousin Mehmed Sokoloviƒá, from the Islamized branch of the family, held the post of the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire (1565‚Äì1579) and acted as protector of the Serbian Patriarchate. As patriarch, Gerasim appointed his cousin Savatije Sokoloviƒá to be the next Metropolitan of Herzegovina. In time, some disputes arose between two cousins, resulting in rivalry for the patriarchal throne. Eventually, Metropolitan Savatije managed to succeed Patriarch Gerasim, probably in 1585 or 1586.

Biography Charlotte Kingsley was born in Devon to the Reverend Charles Kingsley and Mary Lucas Kingsley. Her older brothers Charles and Henry both became novelists, as did her niece, Lucas Malet. She spent her childhood in Clovelly, Devon, where her father was curate and then rector. She moved to London in 1836. Her husband, John Mills Chanter, became the vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Ilfracombe. Chanter's 1856 book Ferny Combes was the first book to draw public attention to the great diversity of ferns to be found in Devonshire. Her book focused mainly on ferns discoverable within an easy distance of the coast. Like other botanizing authors of this period, she encouraged people to dig up rare ferns, contributing to the increasing rarity of certain Devon ferns. Her brother Charles coined the term pteridomania for this Victorian craze for ferns. Chanter's 1861 novel Over the Cliffs had elements of both the gothic novel and the sensation novel, with a plot revolving around murder and an inheritance. Although it is said to have been well received in its day, it was panned by at least one critic.

After completing her education at the Haskell Institute, she attended Santa Fe Indian School, studying weaving, dancing, and cultural arts. After her training, she taught arts and crafts at Chilocco Indian School before joining the faculty of the newly opened Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. She taught weaving, design, and dance at the Institute, and in 1968 was one of the coordinators for a dance exhibit at the Mexican Summer Olympic Games. In 1973, she retired from teaching to focus on her own work, exhibiting throughout the Americas and in Europe and the Middle East. She has work in the permanent collection of the IAIA and has been featured at the Smithsonian Institution. Between 2014 and 2016, she was featured in an exhibition of Native American women artists at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in Santa Fe. Early life Josephine Myers was born on February 10, 1912 on her grandmother's allotment near Apache, Oklahoma to Hevah (n√©e Lena Fischer) and James H. Myers. She was one of nine children: Mima, Randlett Cragg, Rudolph Fisher, Catherine, Josephine, Melvin, Walker, Vincent, and Alvin. Myers attended St. Patrick's Indian Mission School in Anadarko, Oklahoma and completed high school at the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, studying to become a secretary. In 1933, she went to study at the Santa Fe Indian School under a program designed to train Native Americans to teach art at the American Indian boarding schools. For two years, she studied fingerweaving and loom-weaving, as well as pottery making under Maria Martinez. Career In November 1934, Myers returned to Oklahoma and started the first art classes at Chilocco Indian School. When she began her work, the school only purchased one loom, but other departments at the school helped to build looms and spinning wheels. She taught basket weaving, beading, and pottery making to beginners, and taught the more advanced students to make rag dolls, cross-stitch, dyeing, fingerweaving, rag weaving, and spinning. She continued to teach art and married Edward Wapp c. 1940, giving birth to their first child, Barbara, in August 1940. Edward Jr., who would become a noted Native American flautist, was born in 1943. She expanded the arts department throughout her time at Chilocco and by the 1950s had created a drama department, which performed ceremonial dances for the White House Conference on Children and Youth in 1960. She continued her own studies during the summers and earned her bachelor's degree in education in 1959 from Oklahoma State University. She taught at Chilocco until 1961, then taught briefly at the Santa Fe Indian School before being selected as one of the first teachers for the newly established Institute of American Indian Arts. Wapp was one of the main teachers of traditional arts at IAIA, teaching courses in beadwork, costume and fashion design, traditional art techniques, textiles, and weaving. Focused on utilizing primarily natural materials, she taught her students to appreciate Native and Native-inspired garments and accessories and tried to impart the tribal traditions from which the techniques had arisen. Wapp also taught a course in traditional Indian dance. While at IAIA, she learned the Eastern Woodlands tribal tradition of fingerweaving, which was not in her Comanche heritage. Of the three basic patterns woven without a loom, Wapp became best known for the arrowpoint pattern, which is the most difficult. She also continued her own studies, earning a master's degree from the University of New Mexico. She encouraged her students to take the skills they learned in their home economics courses and bring them into her traditional techniques course, as an expression of their tribal pride. In 1968, Wapp and ceramicist Otellie Loloma, a colleague at IAIA, coordinated a dance exhibition with their students which they performed at the White House and then at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Two years later, the school organized a fashion club, which participated in fashion shows throughout the country. Her students soon realized that by participating in Wapp's fashion design classes, they'd be able to create their own designs and travel. In 1972, she took students to fashion shows in Houston, Texas; the Indian Fashion Show at the Denver Art Museum in Colorado; New York City; and exhibited fashion designs at the La Fonda on the Plaza in Santa Fe. The following year, she retired from teaching to focus on her own work. After retirement, Wapp gave demonstrations of hand weaving techniques and spoke widely on traditional Indian arts. She served on the committee which founded the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center in Lawton, Oklahoma, and her work was displayed at the museum's opening in 2007. She served on the museum's board for several years, and in 2009 was the featured artist at an event showcasing her works for her 97th birthday. Wapp's work was featured at the opening of the National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan in 1994, to help fundraise for the 2001 projected opening of the National Museum of the American Indian at the National Mall in Washington, D. C. In 2009, her work was exhibited at the Oklahoma State Capitol in a solo exhibition titled The Artistic Legacy of Josephine Myers-Wapp: The Weaving of Stories and Tradition. In 2013, she was the recipient of the Povi‚Äôka Award of the Santa Fe Indian Market in recognition of her leadership and support to Native American artists and communities. Death and legacy Wapp died on October 26, 2014, in Lawton, Oklahoma and was buried at the Fairview Cemetery in her hometown of Apache. Between 2014 and 2016, an exhibit honoring Native American women artists, featuring works by Jeri Ah-be-hill, Margarete Bagshaw, and Wapp, was on display at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in Santa Fe. The Institute of American Indian Art's Museum of Contemporary Native Art, in downtown Santa Fe, has some of her work in its permanent collection. Her teaching career was widely influential; Wendy Ponca, who followed Sandy Wilson in teaching Wapp's traditional techniques courses in 1982, drew on both Wapp and Wilson's legacies in teaching Native fashion designers into the 1990s. She also won multiple awards for her contemporary Native fashion designs, taking first prize from the Santa Fe Indian Market every year from 1982 until 1987. Phyllis Wahahrocktah-Tasi, director of the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center, was one of Wapp's students.

Charro in Spanish is a costumed horseman.La Jolla Historical Society, \\"Do You Remember the Del Charro?\\" History alt=Arrangement of the Hotelthumbright600pxArrangement of the Hotel del Charro, showing main buildings and bungalows with names of frequent guests First constructed in June 1931, as a riding club, the predecessor to the del Charro was located at the junction of La Jolla Canyon (now Torrey Pines Road) and Ardath Road (now La Jolla Parkway) on a 4 acre tract. Until 1937, it was run by a Miss Jean Moore, after which it was purchased by a Captain W.W. Beckwith, who operated it as La Jolla Riding Stables. About 1945, the property was sold to Mr. and Mrs. J.R. Marechal, of Texas, who converted it to a motor hotel with riding facilities, opening as the Rancho del Charro in 1948. Because of its proximity to the La Jolla Playhouse, which had been founded by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Mel Ferrer in 1947, the hotel soon hosted many Hollywood and Broadway celebrities. In 1951 the Marechals sold the property to a Nevada corporation widely understood (by insiders) to be controlled by Texas billionaires Clint Murchison and Sid Richardson. (E.g., funds for the purchase were borrowed from an insurance company owned by Murchison.) Renamed the \\"Hotel del Charro\\", the buildings were remodeled and a swimming pool was added. Thereafter, one or another of the co-owners were frequently in residence at the hotel.Matt Potter, \\"Oil and Politics in La Jolla\\", San Diego Reader, January 5, 2011 Heyday ‚ÄúSerious citizens in La Jolla tend to feel that Hotel del Charro is a Texas enclave, not too much concerned with the town‚Äôs welfare,‚Äù observed a local in 1954.James Britton, San Diego Magazine, August 1954 By then, the hotel was nationally famous. A New York Times piece on San Diego's post-war boom described it as a \\"fabulous hostelry\\" with every guest room having either a private patio, sundeck, or balcony. \\"Its restaurant, built around a huge jacaranda tree, has not one chef, but two, one imported from Scotland, the other from Palm Springs.\\" The pool was described as \\"Texas-size\\", crescent-shaped, with pool-side cabanas.James Edgeworth, \\"San Diego Boom: Sprawling Navy and Aircraft Town Is Now Developing as a Resort\\", New York Times, January 17, 1954 Celebrity guests of the time included John Wayne, Elizabeth Taylor, William Powell, Jimmy Durante, and Betty Grable, along with Murchison's Texas oilman friends Effie and Wofford Cain, Emily and Billy Byars, and Jodie and Pug Miller. A Texas flag flew overhead, and there was a Dow-Jones stock ticker machine in the lobby.Bryan Burrough, The Big Rich: The Rise and Fall of the Greatest Texas Oil Fortunes, The Penguin Press (2009) Close to the Del Mar racetrack (itself later acquired by Murchison and Richardson), the hotel attracted wealthy horse-race aficionados. A 1956 article in the Daily Racing Form by the hotel's own general manager gave this description of racing season at the hotel: \\"The chauffeurs arrive from town with the longest and blackest of the General Motors products. All are air-conditioned, about the same length as a Pullman car, and a trifle less expensive. One of these belongs to oil tycoon Roy Woods, who has a dollar for every drop of water in Niagara Falls.

Columnist Jack Anderson reported in 1971 that Hoover's bill was always \\"comped\\" by the hotel's owners. According to Anderson, manager Witwer told him that over the years Hoover ran up a total tab of $15,000. Hoover sometimes entertained guests in his bungalow, one of whom was Arthur Samish, a lobbyist who was said to represent organized crime interests in the liquor industry, and another of whom was Howard Hughes. On first entering the bungalow, Hughes reportedly asked for Hoover's assurance that the premises were not bugged. Senator Joseph McCarthy was another frequent guest. ‚ÄúMcCarthy was virtually on Murchison‚Äôs payroll,‚Äù manager Allan Witwer related. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd get drunk and jump in the pool, sometimes naked.

As a result, about 70 banks failed. The novel follows the effects of the events on two fictional English communities named Aldersbury and Garth.

Nritya (IAST: N·πõitya, ‡§®‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø), also referred to as Nrit, Nritta, Natana or Natya, refers to \\"dance, act on the stage, act, gesticulate, play\\" in the Indian traditions.Nritya, Encyclopaedia Britannica‡§®‡•É‡§§‡•ç, Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 515 It is sometimes sub-divided into two forms: nritta or pure dance, wherein expression-less movements of a dancer play out the rhythms and phrases of the music; and nritya or expressive dance, wherein the dancer includes facial expression and body language to portray mood and ideas with the rhythmic movements to communicate with the audience. Nritya is broadly categorized as one of three parts of Sangita, the other two being gita (vocal music, song) and vadya (instrumental music). These ideas appear in the Vedic literature of Hinduism such as in the Aitareya Brahmana, and in early post- Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra, Panchatantra, Malvikagnimitra and Kathasaritsagara. Nritya and Nata appears in Vedic era literature. For example, section 4.104 of Unadi Sutras mention Nata as \\"dancer, mime, actor\\".‡§®‡§ü‡•ç, Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 466 Panini too mentions the terms Nritya and Nartaka respectively as dance and dancer, in his treatise on Sanskrit grammar. The term Nritya appears in all major classical Indian dance forms as one form of their repertoire, inspired by the guidelines of the Natya Shastra. These are Nritta, Nritya and Natya: *The Nritta performance is an abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The dancer performs pure dance steps by using adavu. In simple words, we can say that Nritta means pure classical dance. *The Nritya is a slower and significant aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a nritya, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of the repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, and it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer. *The Natyam is a play, typically a team performance,Kavitha Jayakrishnan (2011), Dancing Architecture: the parallel evolution of BharatanƒÅtyam and South Indian Architecture, MA Thesis, Awarded by University of Waterloo, Canada, page 25 but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story.

Kelly (December 8, 1948 ‚Äì January 21, 1993) was a landscape architect based in New York City, an advocate for the preservation and restoration of the landscapes designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. He is also remembered for his own designs in New York's parks, including Strawberry Fields, the memorial to John Lennon in New York's Central Park. Early life, education and career Bruce Kelly was born in 1948 at Wrens, Georgia. In 1971, he received a bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from the University of Georgia and in 1973, he received a master's degree in historic preservation from Columbia University. From July to September 1974, Kelly was in Tuscany preparing archaeological drawings of the ancient Roman town of Cosa, excavated under the auspices of the American Academy in Rome. After returning to New York, he worked from 1974 to 1977 for the Central Park Task Force, formed to help rehabilitate Central Park. In May 1977, Kelly formed Bruce Kelly Associates. An early client, the Central Park Conservancy, engaged him to help compile an inventory of the park's natural assets, the first done in decades. Completed between 1982 and 1985, the exercise led to the creation of the Conservancy's master plan for the subsequent restoration of the park (published in 1987 as Rebuilding Central Park: A Management and Restoration Tool).Resume included in Kelly/Varnell's Forest Park Redevelopment Proposal, June 1989. In October 1981, Kelly and Gail Guillet organized an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art entitled \\"Art of the Olmsted Landscape.\\" Paul Goldberger, \\"Landscape as Design,\\" The New York Times, October 13, 1981. The exhibit and the accompanying catalogue helped cement Kelly's reputation as an Olmsted expert. That same month, Kelly obtained his license to practice landscape architecture in New York State. In March 1986, Kelly formed a partnership with David Varnell, a classmate from the University of Georgia, where in 1971 they jointly published their senior thesis, a planning study for Washington, Georgia.Bruce Rodney Kelly and Forrest David Varnell. Washington- Wilkes, a Proposal for Downtown Revival (Senior Thesis, Bachelor of Landscape Architecture, University of Georgia, 1971). Kelly and Varnell were well known for their many master plans and projects for public spaces, but on a parallel track they cultivated a private practice. Writing in 1988, James Baily noted that Kelly was active \\"...in the most rarefied strata of the private sector, undertaking elaborate garden projects for such clients as Mary Morgan, Carolyne Roehm and Henry Kravis, Yoko Ono, Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg, and some dozen others. These are good times to be Bruce Kelly.\\" James Thomas Herbert Baily, The Connoisseur, Volume 218, 1988.

The Zuyongdiao consists of Zu, the tax paid in grains, Yong that was paid in corvee and Diao which was paid in textiles.  In China  Zuyongdiao was paired with the policy of land equalization and was effective according to the later policy. The land equalization provides equally divided grain fields to farmers. Every farmer will pay a fixed amount of grain as tax under the name of Zu. The basic unit of tax collection was thus one individual. Yong was a tax paid in unpaid laboring. Every citizen in Tang dynasty works 20 days per year for the government without payment. If the person is handicapped, he or she pays Yong by weaving textiles. The practice of Zuyongdiao in China was hindered by the An Lushan Rebellion. After the turbulence ended, the Tang court lost a considerable number of individuals who were able to pay the tax (Deaths and casualties during the rebellion were severe). The consequence was that Zuyongdiao no longer collects a sufficient amount of taxes. The system's weakening also has its sociological factors. It collects taxes one by one from every subject of the imperial court. Since every citizen has to pay his due, one could only afford to pay the tax if he has his own fields to cultivate. However, not everyone possessed grain fields. In addition, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu, owners of large plantations began to annex lands owned by self employed farmers. The annexation caused farmers to lose lands and consequently their inability to pay the Zu, Yong and Diao as an individual. The flaw within the system only worsened during the following years. Landless farmers were forced out of their home and became vagabonds, the imperial court had lost the exact registration of households. In the end, local officials had no resource of taxation because objects of taxation were completely lost (Either deceased, fled to other prefectures or in poverty). In 780, the Zuyongdiao was abolished according to the advice of Chancellor Yang Yan and was substituted by the Two- Tax system. = Applicable Objects = According to the Tang Code edited by chancellor Zhangsun Wuji, the amendment of 27th article states that an object of taxation and corvee has to be a male aged between the age of 21 and 59. Female objects are only responsible of paying taxes if her spouse could not fulfill the duty while there is no male members in the family to substitute. Government officials and physically disabled ones were exempted from taxation and corvee.  In Japan  In 646, Emperor K≈çtoku issued the edict of Taika reform. According to the edict of reform written in Classical Chinese, the 4th resolution states that the old way of taxation is to be abolished while So(Zu), Y≈ç(Yong) and Ch≈ç(Diao) are established. In 757, Empress K≈çken's Y≈çr≈ç Code formalized the system of Soyocho. Although the Japanese Soyocho was based on the Zuyongdiao of China, it differs slightly in terms of specific ways of collecting the three kinds of taxes.  In Korea  The Korean Silla dynasty established the system of Joyongjo according to its Chinese model Zuyongdiao.Household registration system and Joyongjo were together adopted by Silla.  In Vietnam  Vietnam was under the rule of Tang dynasty as Annan province. As a part of China, Annan's taxes were collected in the form of Zuyongdiao. In 1723, the later L√™ dynasty of Vietnam enacted the law of Zuyongdiao as well. The policy was promoted by the Tr·ªãnh lords as a part of its fortification of rule in southern Vietnam against Nguy·ªÖn lords  References  Category:Economic history of China Category:Economic history of Korea Category:Economic history of Japan Category:Economic history of Vietnam ","title":"Zu Yong Diao"},{"id":"54884215","title":"List of Pioneer League champions"},{"id":"54884221","text":"La Plume is an unincorporated community in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States.

PECS was developed in 1985 at the Delaware Autism Program by Andy Bondy, PhD, and Lori Frost, MS, CCC-SLP.Overcash, A., & Horton, C. (2010). The picture exchange communication system: Helping individuals gain functional communication. Autism Advocate, 3, 21-24 The developers of PECS noticed that traditional communication techniques, including speech imitation, sign language, and picture point systems, relied on the teacher to initiate social interactions and none focused on teaching students to initiate interactions. Based on these observations, Bondy and Frost created a functional means of communication for individuals with a variety of communication challenges. Although PECS was originally developed for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), its use has become much more widespread. Through the years, PECS has been successfully implemented with individuals with varying diagnoses across the aged span. PECS is an evidence- based practice that has been highly successful with regard to the development of functional communication skills. Philosophy The training protocol is based on the principles of applied behavior analysis.Bondy AS, Frost LA (1994). The Picture Exchange Communication System. Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, Vol. 9, No. 3, 1-19 (1994) The goal of PECS is spontaneous and functional communication. The PECS teaching protocol is based on B. F. Skinner's book, Verbal Behavior, such that functional verbal operants are systematically taught using prompting and reinforcement strategies that will lead to independent communication. Verbal prompts are not used, thus building immediate initiation and avoiding prompt dependency. PECS begins with teaching a student to exchange a picture of a desired item with a communicative partner, who immediately honors the request. After the student learns to spontaneously request for a desired item, the system goes on to teach discrimination among symbols and then how to construct a simple sentence. In the most advanced phases, individuals are taught to respond to questions and to comment. Additionally, descriptive language concepts such as size, shape, color, number, etc. are also taught so the student can make their message more specific. For example, I want big yellow ball. PECS protocol Reinforcer inventory: Prior to implementing the PECS protocol, it is highly recommended that the teacher, parent, or caregiver develops an inventory of items such as toys, books, and edibles that the learner enjoys. Preferred items are presented to the learner to determine which one(s) they want. This preference assessment is completed throughout the day in a variety of activities. Once the desired item or activity is determined, the communicative partner will entice the student with the item(s) by holding or showing the item. This way, no verbal prompting is needed.. The chosen reinforcers should be assessed to ensure they are consistently motivating to the user.Bondy, A.S., and L. Frost. 2001. \\"The Picture Exchange Communication System.\\" Behav Modif. 25(5):725-744. The PECS Protocol occurs in six phases: Phase 1 - how to communicate: During phase I, the focus is on teaching the student to initiate social communication by exchanging a picture of a desired item. This exchange is taught presenting one picture, selected by the trainer based on the student's observed preferences. Within Phase I, two trainers are utilized. One trainer acts as the student's communicative partner, and the other trainer acts as the physical prompter, who prompts the student after he makes an initiation towards the desired item. The student is taught to pick up the picture and reach towards the communicative partner with the picture, in exchange for the requested item.http://www.corwin.com/upm- data/2675_10bmod01.pdf#page=58 Phase 2 - distance and persistence: During phase 2, the student is taught to expand the initiated social interaction by creating motivation for the student to seek out the communicative partner even when he or she is not nearby and waiting. The goal of this phase is to have the student generalize his or her requests across places and people and to increase the likeliness of spontaneous communication. The student is taught to communicate over longer distances whether it be across a table or going to another location to find a communicative partner, and initiate spontaneous communication. Training should progress across different settings, with different communicative partners, and different types of highly motivating and preferred items to assist in the generalization of PECS usage. Phase 3 - discrimination between symbols: As soon as the student has demonstrated distance and persistence in multiple settings with multiple communicative partners, they are ready to be introduced to phase 3A - visual discrimination. During structured training sessions, the student will begin to work on discriminating between highly preferred and non-preferred items. During other times throughout the day, the learner should continue to generalize phase 2 skills. The next step is to teach discrimination between two items that are both contextually relevant and desirable to the learner. This is done with correspondence checks to ensure that the learner is requesting and taking the item for which he or she is asking. is taught discrimination of symbols and how to select the symbol which depicts a desired item. If students have difficulty with discrimination, there are systematic ways of incorporating error correction and alternative strategies. The ECS phase 3 App created by Pyramid Educational Consultants provides an easy way for teachers to practice picture discrimination with one or several learners within a single session. Phase 4 - using phrases: Within phase 4, the student learns to construct simple sentences on a detachable sentence strip making requests such as \\"I want ____ \\". The requests consist of a sentence starter, \\"I want\\", and a picture of the desired activity or item. The communicative partner reads back the sentence after it has been exchanged by the student. After the student has learned to construct the sentence and point to the pictures, a delay between \\"I want\\" and the picture of the desired item is inserted as a way to encourage vocalizations. Speech/vocalizations are celebrated by providing the student with a greater amount of the requested item/activity and additional preferred items as a way to promote speech on future exchanges. It is important to note that speech/vocalizations are never demanded, just encouraged through the use of the delay. Teaching PECS users to create a sentence using expressions such as \\"I want ___\\" is the first step in developing more complex sentence structures. After the student learns the basic sentence structure, descriptors such as color, shape, size, number are taught so that learner can make their preferences more specific, such as \\"I want 3 cars\\". Phase 5 - answering a direct question: During phase 5, the student is taught to respond to the question, \\"What do you want?\\" The goal of this phase is for the learner to respond \\"I want ___ \\" after being asked some form of the \\"what do you want\\" question. This phase adds upon the already established skill of building a sentence while still using the desired item to motivate the user to respond. A delayed prompting procedure is used in which the question and gestural prompt are initially presented at the same time and later a delay is established between the question and gestural prompt. Ultimately, the student should answer the question before additional prompts are provided. Phase 6 - commenting: The student can now make spontaneous requests and respond questions such as \\"What do you want?\\" by building the sentence \\"I want ___\\" Within phase 6, the student is taught to respond to commenting questions as well as to spontaneously comment on items, people, or activities present in his or her environment. In this phase, the student is also taught the meaning of sentence starters to differentiate between appropriate responses to the questions \\"What do you see?\\", which results in a social outcome and \\"What do you want?\\" which results in a tangible outcome The teacher should structure the environment to give the student plenty of opportunities to have a variety of communication opportunities that encompass all of their communication skills.Frost, L., & Bondy, A.(2002) The Picture Exchange Communication System training manual, 2nd ed. Pyramid Educational Consultants, Inc. Depending on the age and cognitive level of the user, the time to master PECS will vary. One study found that it takes an average of 246 trials for users to master all six phases of PECS.Charlop-Christy, M.H., Carpenter, M., et al. (2002). Using the picture exchange communication system (PECS) with children with autism: assessment of PECS acquisition, speech, social-communicative behavior, and problem behavior. Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis, 35(3): 213-231. Effectiveness There is evidence that PECS is easily learned by most students, with its primary benefit being a means of communication for children and adults who have limited or no speech due to autism or other communication disorders. With regard to the intervention setting for AAC training, there is evidence that PECS is most readily learned when instruction takes place in a general education setting.Ganz et al. (2013) Moderation of effects of AAC based on setting and types of aided AAC on outcome variables: An aggregate study of single-case research with individuals with ASD. Evidence also indicated that learners initiate a higher number of picture exchanges when PECS is taught in a single setting versus multiple settings.Tincani, M., & Devis, K. (2011). Quantitative Synthesis and Component Analysis of Single- Participant Studies on the Picture Exchange Communication System. Remedial & Special Education, 32(6), 458-470. The consensus among most researchers is that \\"PECS is recommended as an evidence-based intervention for enhancing functional communication skills of individuals with ASD.\\"Tien, K-C. (2008). Effectiveness of the Picture Exchange Communication System as a functional communication intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A practice-based research synthesis. Education and Training in Developmental Disabilities, 43, 61-76. On the other hand, the 2009 National Standards Report from the National Autism Center lists PECs among emerging treatments that do not have sufficient evidence of effectiveness.National Autism Center. (2009).National Standards Report page 76. An initial concern was that PECS might delay or inhibit speech development. However, a recent review of several peer-reviewed studies found that \\"there is no evidence within the reviewed studies to suggest that PECS inhibited speech; to the contrary, if any effect was observed, it was facilitative rather than inhibitory.\\"Tincani, M. & Devis, K. (2010). Quantitative synthesis and component analysis of single-participant studies on the Picture Exchange Communication System. Remediation and Special Education (Online First), 1-13. When difficulties do arise, it is often due to a lack of powerful reinforcers and/or trainer error.Horton, C., Matteo, J. A., Waegenaere, J., & Frost, L. (2008). Pecs: Fact and fiction. Presentation delivered at the 2008 ASHA Convention. Retrieved from www.asha.org/Events/convention/handouts/2008/1528_Frost_Lori/ A systematic review of interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder reported that use of PECS resulted in short-term improvement in word acquisition, but the effects were not maintained over time.Warren, Z., Veenstra-VanderWeele, J., et al. (2011). Therapies for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders. Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF. Evidence from meta-analyses indicate that PECS does not result in equal communicative outcomes for all children with ASD. PECS training appears to have the most beneficial effects for younger learners.Ganz, J. B., Davis, J. L., et al. (2012). Meta-Analysis of PECS with Individuals with ASD: Investigation of Targeted Versus Non- Targeted Outcomes, Participant Characteristics, and Implementation Phase. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 33(2), 406-418. In addition, evidence of maintenance and generalization effects of functional communication gains achieved through PECs training has been mixed.Flippin, M., Reszka, S., et al. (2010). Effectiveness of the Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS) on Communication and Speech for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Meta- Analysis. American Journal of Speech-Language-Pathology, 19, 178-195. Research indicates that \\"PECS is probably best used as an initial intervention to teach manding and the basic elements of what is a communicative exchange,\\" and is not the best selection \\"for a long-term intervention as it does not address question asking and may be better implemented as part of a multimodal system for when picture communications are more socially appropriate.\\" Ostryn, C., Wolfe, P. S., et al. (2008). A Review and Analysis of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) for Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders Using a Paradigm of Communication Competence. Research & Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities, 33(1-2), 13-24. Additional applications There is emerging research that suggests adults with developmental disabilities and severe communication deficits may benefit from the implementation of PECS.Conklin, C. G. (2011-03-01). Effects of implementing the picture exchange communication system (PECS) with adults with developmental disabilities and severe communication deficits.(Report). Remedial and special education, 32(2), 155-166. Others tried to combine PECS training with video modeling.

Haddebo Bruk is a Swedish ironworks estate from the 17th century, situated in the village of Haddebo in the southern part of N√§rke. To the estate belonged two manor houses, the \\"lower Haddebo\\" and the \\"upper Haddebo\\". Both of the original manor houses are gone, however a replica of the upper Haddebo Manor has been rebuilt according to the original renderings preserved in the Nordic Museum, during the 1990s.  History  Haddebo was first mentioned as \\"Haddeboda\\" in a \\"tiondel√§ngd\\" (a Swedish historical listing of farming estates) in 1555, and in a tax document from 1592. The first map of the region was published in 1637, shortly after which, in 1658 Jacob Classon from Norrk√∂ping received rights to start an iron works at Haddebo. Upon Classon's death in 1666, the estate was sold to Mathias Schilt, who after a few years sold Haddebo to the freeman Peder Andersson Wester. Wester had great ambitions for the estate and managed to greatly expand Haddebo's lands as well as production output. In the late 17th century he had the manor house \\"Lower Haddebo\\" built. Wester died at the end of the 17th century, which resulted in a split of the estate into Lower and Upper Haddebo when the inheritance was settled in 1703. The estate of Upper Haddebo built a manor house in the typically Swedish \\"karoliner\\" style in the early 18th century.The estates at Haddebo were very productive, producing energy by damming up the surrounding lakes, and producing cast iron. Both the estates stayed in the Wester family for well over a century until the widow of Arvid Wester, sold Lower Haddebo in 1821, and Upper Haddebo in 1826. During the 19th century, the estates frequently changed hands, and belonged to the families Broms and Floor. Lower Haddebo was in 1862 acquired by Per Fredrik Brandelius, a wealthy brewer from Stockholm. Brandelius also owned Lemn√• Bruk, and went on to found √ñrebro Enskilda Bank (√ñrebro Private Bank) in the nearby city of √ñrebro. Furthermore, Brandelius was the great grandfather of the Swedish diplomat and author Jan M√•rtenson. Both of the estates in Haddebo were acquired by the Swedish state in 1900 and 1902, and became official royal hunting grounds. King Gustaf V of Sweden was very fond of hunting Moose at Haddebo and visited the estate almost every year. To this day the forests which surround Haddebo remain royal hunting grounds, and Prince Carl Philip, shot his first Moose on the grounds in 2002. Gates produced at the Haddebo ironworks in the late 19th century. The buildings at Haddebo suffered greatly during state ownership and both the Manor Houses of Upper and Lower Haddebo perished, Upper Haddebo in a fire 1938 and Lower Haddebo was demolished by the state in 1941. The forestry continued, and so did the electricity production in the dams up until 1965. In the 1970s and 80s the estate faced further decline, up until 1989 when it was acquired by the Hemberg family. The Hemberg's proceeded to begin a major restoration project. The original renderings of Upper Haddebo could be recovered from the Nordic Museum, and at the place of Lower Haddebo a copy of the manor house of Upper Haddebo was built. Old material, such as timber, windows and doors from several other 18th century timber houses, which were to be demolished, were used for the project. The house was built with techniques used when the original house was constructed to create an image as accurate as possible of the original manor house. The estate remains in the Hemberg family as a private residence. In addition to forestry and farming, the estate features a notable stud \\"Haddebo Seminstation\\" since 2003, led by Dr. Elisabeth Hemberg.  The village of Haddebo  Surrounding the estate is the small village of Haddebo, which is the home of the notable Swedish author Torbj√∂rn S√§fve. The village also features a botanical garden \\"Haddebo G√§rdesg√•rd och Blommor\\", and a B&B; \\"Vita Kralan\\".

Biography Gabrielle Francesca Lilian Mary Vallings was born in Hythe, Kent, England, one of nine children of James Frederic Vallings, vicar of Sopley, and Louisa Cadogan Chanter. She was a grand-niece of the novelist Charles Kingsley, who made her his literary executor, and a second cousin of his daughter Mary St Leger Kingsley, a writer better known by her pen name Lucas Malet. Vallings was adopted by the much older Malet while still a teenager. It appears that Vallings may have been briefly engaged to Norman Sladden, a naval officer, in 1916, but there is no record of her ever marrying. Vallings and Malet lived together until Malet's death in 1931, traveling frequently to France. Malet encouraged Vallings to develop her creative abilities, first as a singer and then as a writer. Vallings, a soprano, trained to be an opera singer, but it appears her career never took off as there are few records of public performances. She had begun performing by 1914, when a critic noticed her \\"pleasant soprano voice [and] fine feeling for musical expression\\" but advised further training. In 1919, she sang at a celebrity-studded pageant in honor of the centenary of Charles Kingsley's birth. In 1916, Vallings published Bindweed, the first of her dozen novels, several of which had socialist themes. Bindweed, which the London Times called \\"a powerful first novel\\", centers on the travails of a young opera singer who does not know that she is of illegitimate birth. Her second novel, Tumult (1916) features a cast ranging from Australian sheep ranchers and French aristocrats to the Greek god Pan. Vallings completed Malet's last novel, The Private Life of Mr. Justice Syme, after the author's death in 1931, and it was published in 1932.

Italian scientists, like Enrico Fermi and Edoardo Amaldi had been at the forefront of the development of nuclear weapons in the United States, but rejected the technology at the end of the Second World War. After abortive proposals to establish a multilateral program with NATO Allies in the 1950s and 1960s, Italy launched a national nuclear weapons program. The country converted the light cruiser and developed and tested a ballistic missile called Alfa. The program ended in 1975 upon Italy's accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Currently, Italy does not produce or possess nuclear weapons but takes part in the NATO nuclear sharing program, hosting B61 nuclear bombs at the Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases. Background Italian physicists, like Enrico Fermi had been at the forefront of the development of the nuclear fission, and the creation of the first nuclear weapon. However, the work had been carried out in the US in conditions of great secrecy. This, combined with the fact that Fermi and others repudiated nuclear weapons after atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, meant that Italy had no better access to the technology than any other country at the end of World War II. However, Italy was quick to realise the new geopolitical situation of the emerging Cold War and created a political strategy that relied on multilateralism, principally through a close relationship with the United States, membership of NATO and greater European integration. The Italian Army was particularly keen to acquire nuclear weapons, seeing them primarily in a tactical role. Italy started hosting nuclear weapons under NATO's nuclear sharing policy. The first nuclear weapons deployed were MGR-1 Honest John and MGM-5 Corporal rockets in 1957, and were later followed by the MIM-14 Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile. However, the United States maintained ownership, custody and control of all these systems, so Italy simultaneously pursued dialogue with other European nations on a collaborative nuclear programme. Discussions were held with France and Germany about a joint nuclear deterrent, but these were curtailed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle's desire for an independent French deterrent. Jupiter deployment sitesalt=Sites where PGM-19 Jupiter missiles were deployed between 1960 and 1963thumbright300px The decision by Switzerland on 23 December 1958 to pursue a nuclear weapons programme put an additional impetus on Italy. Pressure was made on the United States to provide additional nuclear weapons. On 26 March 1959, agreement was made that the Italian Air Force would receive 30 PGM-19 Jupiter ballistic missiles to operate from Gioia del Colle Air Base. The first missiles arrived on 1 April 1960. This time the Americans provided a dual-key system ()) that led the Italian government to believe they had greater control over the deterrent and thus more power in NATO. Explicitly, the new missiles could be used \\"for the execution of NATO plans and policies in times of peace as well as war\\". The missiles were operated by a new brigade, the 36¬™ Aerobrigata. Multilateral Force At the same time as working with the United States, Italy explored working within the NATO Multilateral Force (MLF) concept to develop a European nuclear force. MLF was a concept promoted by the United States to place all NATO nuclear weapons not operated by their own services under a joint control, with dual-key control by American and European forces. For the United States, the MLF was an attempt to balance the desire from other members to play a role in nuclear deterrence with their interest in bringing all existing and potential Western nuclear arsenals under the umbrella of a more cohesive NATO alliance. Italy had long argued for nuclear cooperation, with Minister of Defence Paolo Emilio Taviani saying on 29 November 1956 that the Italian government was trying to persuade their \\"Allies to remove the unjustified restrictions regarding the access of NATO countries to new weapons.\\" The policy was pursued by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and formed a fundamental part of the negotiations around the Nassau Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom and the attempted accession of the United Kingdom to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1961. Under MLF, the United States proposed that various NATO countries operate UGM-27 Polaris IRBM on seaborne platforms, both nuclear submarines and aboard surface ships. The Italian Navy proposed a nuclear powered submarine and a conversion of a cruiser. Announced in July 1959, the programme paralleled similar work in the US. The Navy took the light cruiser out of service and rebuilt the ship between 1957 and 1961 as a guided missile cruiser with launchers for four Polaris missiles. The successful test of the missiles took place in September 1962. Shortly afterwards, in December 1962, Italian Minister of Defence Giulio Andreotti officially asked the United States for assistance in developing nuclear propulsion for its fleet. The Italian government saw the growth of the movement to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons as a major challenge to its nuclear programme. At the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, the Italian government argued that multilateral activity like the MLF as excluded from any agreement on non- proliferation, but found that the Soviet Union required that MLF be terminated as part of their negotiations on the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the United States all but killed the agreement on 17 December 1964 with National Security Action Memorandum No. 322. At the same time, on 5 January 1963, the United States announced that they would withdraw the Jupiter missiles as a consequence of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The decision was approved by the Italian government and the missile brigade was deactivated on 1 April 1963. Italy's indigenous program 200px With the failure of its multilateral efforts, Italy looked again at creating an independent deterrent. Italy had experience with nuclear technology, with a well developed nuclear power industry with BWR, Magnox, and PWR technologies, as well as the 5MW RTS-1 'Galileo Galilei' test reactor at CAMEN (, Center for Military Applications of Nuclear Energy). It also had a large number of nuclear capable aircraft, including the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, and was developing the Panavia Tornado with nuclear strike in mind. =Alfa= Italian Alfa missile side and cutaway views In 1971, the Italian Navy began an ingenious program to develop ballistic missiles called Alfa. Officially the project was termed as a development effort for a study on efficient solid-propellant rockets for civil and military applications. It was planned as a two-stage rocket and could be carried on submarines or ships. Ever since 27 March 1960, when Admiral Pecori Geraldi had argued that a seaborne nuclear force was the most resistant to attack, the navy had looked for an opportunity to take on a nuclear role. Alfa was long and had a diameter of . The first stage of the Alfa was long and contained 6 t of solid rocket fuel. It supplied a thrust of 232 kN for a duration of 57 seconds. It could carry a one ton warhead for a range of , placing European Russia and Moscow in range from the Adriatic Sea. After the first stage motor was fired eleven times in static tests, three test missiles with inert second stages were successfully launched at Salto di Quirra in Sardinia, the last on 6 April 1976. However, the combination of high costs of over 6 billion lira and a changing political climate meant that the project was doomed. In addition, there was an increasing risk of nuclear escalation outside Europe and domestic pressure for Italy to take play its part in reducing the nuclear tension. These combined with pressure from the United States led to Italy abandoning its nuclear weapons program and ratifying the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 2 May 1975. The technological heritage of Alfa is today in light solid-propellant space launchers, like the current Vega rocket. In more recent years, the country, working as part of the European Space Agency, has demonstrated the reentry and landing of a capsule called IXV. Popular attitudes to nuclear weapons In the 1950s, the Italian population was generally considered ignorant on matters of the high politics of the recently emerged Atomic Age. While there was a strong awareness of the risk of nuclear war and a desire for disarmament, this was not widely articulated and public discourse was rare. The attitude towards the basing of nuclear weapons on Italian soil was generally on political lines, with followers of Christian Democracy being positive and supporters of the Italian Communist Party being against. The position of the other parties varied, A broader movement for nuclear disarmament, and against nuclear weapons testing, emerged in the mid-1950s. A combination of Christian pacifist and marxists, many of whom were not affiliated to the main political parties, collaborated in a series of publications and demonstrations. At the same time, Italian physicists like Edoardo Amaldi spoke out against the use of nuclear research in war, particularly through multinational action like the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, programmes and magazine articles on the dangers of nuclear war remained popular and the level of discussion on the issue increased. The creation of an Italian nuclear deterrent was not widely supported, and when new US weapons were deployed, the government kept them as quiet as possible to avoid unleashing a backlash. Nuclear weapons in Italy since 1975 The Italian Air Force flies the F-35 which has the ability to carry the B61 nuclear bomb. Since ratifying the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and halting its own programme, Italy has continued to host nuclear weapons on its soil. The country remained part of the NATO nuclear sharing program and has been used by the United States Army for their deployment of the BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile, MGM-52 Lance tactical ballistic missile and W33, W48 and W79 artillery shells. The Italian Army unit 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\" was trained to use the munitions. The country has been an active participant in the programme, for example, taking a lead in March 1979 in the deployment of what would become the BGM-109G ahead of the other NATO members. B61 nuclear bombs were also stationed in Italy. It is believed that the Italian Air Force could use these weapons in case of war: in 2005, former Italian President Francesco Cossiga stated that Italy's plans of retaliation during the Cold War consisted in dropping nuclear weapons on Prague and Budapest if there had been a Soviet first strike against NATO members. Cossiga also speculated about the possible presence of French and British nuclear weapons in Italian soil.Interview with Cossiga on Blu notte - Misteri italiani, episode \\"OSS, CIA, GLADIO, i Rapporti Segreti tra America e Italia\\" in 2005 During the 1980s, however, there was an increasing popular movement against nuclear weaponry. At the same time as the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp was being set up in Berkshire, England, 60,000 people marched from Perugia to Assisi against nuclear war on 27 September. The following month, between 200,000 and 300,000 people marched in Rome. The movement was politically broad, attracting mainly young people, and grew rapidly. The march on 22 October 1982 attracted between half a million and one million supporters. The movement received another boost in 1987 when, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, a series of referendums demonstrated popular opinion against nuclear power. The United States Army removed their last nuclear weapons from Italy in 1992 when they withdrew the last Lance missile. However, for many people, this did not go far enough. In March 2008, 67,248 Italian citizens signed a petition to declare the country a nuclear-free zone. In June, senior politicians across the political spectrum, Massimo D'Alema, Arturo Parisi, Gianfranco Fini, Giorgio La Malfa and Francesco Calogero, signed a statement in favour of disarmament. As of 2015, there were between 70 and 90 B61 nuclear bombs mod 3, mod 4 and mod 7 stored in two locations, 50 at the Aviano Air Base, and from 20 to 40 at the Ghedi Air Base. They can be delivered by USAF General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons of 31st Fighter Wing that are based at Aviano and Italian Panavia Tornados of 6¬∫ Stormo Alfredo Fusco that are based at Ghedi. The Tornado fleet will potentially be replaced by Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning although it is not certain that these will be nuclear capable.

Built in 1939 by the federal Works Progress Administration, it is the fifth courthouse to serve Jefferson County. Early history The first settlers in the county were Andrew Moore and his family, who arrived in 1810, but he and one of his sons were killed by Indians,Perrin, William Henry, ed. History of Jefferson County, Illinois. Chicago: Globe, 1883. and his wife and her remaining children left and settled in Equality. The first surveyors came in 1815, and some of them returned in the following year to settle in the area. The first General Assembly after statehood enacted a law in 1819 creating Jefferson County and appointed a team of commissioners to locate the county seat, provided that the landowner donate land for the foundation of the town. This law specified a location at which the commissioners were to meet, and within a week the commissioners chose the meeting location for the new county seat. A few individuals wished for a different location, but no significant dissension ever arose,Wall, John A. Wall's history of Jefferson County Illinois. Indianapolis: B.F. Bowen, 1909. and the commissioners chose \\"Mount Vernon\\" as the name of the new town, due to their reverence for George Washington. Previous courthouses At their first meeting, the county commissioners' court ordered the construction of a courthouse, to be a simple log building with a single door and window, and to be completed by September 1819. Although the contract was fulfilled, the building was quickly subjected to significant modifications: winter proved that the building could not be kept warm, and by March 1820, the county's costs had mushroomed from the original $85 to $160 merely for the difficulties of chinking the cracks between the logs, building a fireplace and chimney, and constructing a platform inside the courthouse. As primitive state law required the construction of a stray pound and a jail in a new county seat,Weiser, Dennis. Illinois courthouses: an illustrated history. Virginia Beach: Donning, 2009. both structures were ordered in 1820 to be built nearby. Although this courthouse was not considered particularly safe, the county court had no desire to erect a replacement. The situation changed completely on a calm, quiet night in 1839; the first people stirring in the morning discovered that the courthouse had partially collapsed, leaving a hole on one side large enough to drive a wagon through, and the remains were pulled down with ropes. Their hands having been forced, the commissioners began making arrangements for a replacement, a square brick building on each side with a cupola atop the roof. Set on the public square, this building opened for use in 1840, but unfortunately for the builder, tax revenues had been poor, and he had to wait until 1841 to receive the $5,500 due him by the construction contract. This building remained until 16 March 1869, when it was consumed by an overnight fire that popular reputation ascribed to a drunken sheriff. Two years passed before its replacement was completed, and this building stood only seventeen years before a tornado destroyed it, together with most of the rest of Mount Vernon, on 19 February 1888. A replacement was finished in 1889. Current courthouse The fifth and current courthouse is one of six Works Progress Administration county courthouses in Illinois. A concrete Art Deco structure three stories high, it features a wide staircase on the facade that provides access to the three-bay entrance. Its basement is set only partially below ground, with enough above-ground height that windows are placed throughout the basement walls. The overall plan is irregular, with the second floor being set back from the first and the third from the second. It was finished in 1939.

On July 7, 56 new fires started throughout British Columbia (BC) leading to the release of several evacuation alerts, orders and the declaration of a provincial state of emergency by the Government of British Columbia. By September 12, there were 158 fires burning throughout the province. A total of 12,161 square kilometres (1.2 million hectares) had burned by the end of the 2017 fire season, the largest total area burnt in a fire season in recorded history (1.3% of BC total area).https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/state-emergency-bc- wildfires-1.4803546 This record was broken the following year, with five of BC's worst 10 fire seasons occurring since 2010. However, the 2017 fire season was also notable for the largest number of total evacuees in a fire season (65,000 people), as well as for the largest single fire ever in British Columbia. Research indicates that human-caused climate change played a significant role in the fires. Fire progressions On July 6, the first of many major fires began, starting at two hectares and quickly progressing to be eight times larger by that evening requiring the issue of an evacuation alert that same day. By July 7, 140 fires started throughout BC with most being in the central interior. The fires were aggressive and grew quickly prompting a state of emergency as well as several evacuation alerts and orders. The next day, 182 total fires were active throughout the province prompted the issuing of up to 20 evacuation alerts and orders. The Emergency Operating Centre in Prince George was activated in addition to Emergency Social Services opening a reception centre and lodging at the College of New Caledonia. Within three days, the first major fire that started at two hectares had grown to 4,000 hectares resulting in a mandatory evacuation order being released with up to 2,000 residents being evacuated and by the next day over 10,000 Williams Lake residents were placed on evacuation alert. On July 11, there was a total of 200 fires active with 4,000 evacuees registered in Prince George, resulting in the expansion of lodging to University of Northern British Columbia 2017's fire season became particularly notable for causing the closure of Highway 97 from Kersley, south of Quesnel all the way south to Pavilion (along Highway 99), and south of Ashcroft. It also closed Bella Coola Highway to westbound traffic and created evacuation alerts the entire length of the Bella Coola Highway from Precipice to the junction with Williams Lake. No other fire season has had the breadth of large fires across the province. Three fires have achieved particularly notable sizes of over 100,000 hectares. First, there is the Hanceville Fire (resulting from the merger of the Hanceville, Riske Creek and Raven Lake fires), along Highway 20. As of August 20, the fire has reached its largest size of 227,000 hectares, spreading as far south as Gang Ranch west of 100 Mile House. The second notable fire is the Ashcroft Fire (also known as Elephant Hill Fire). This fire started in the Ashcroft Reserve, and spread north of Highway 99 as far as Green Lake east of 100 Mile House. Finally there is the Nazko Complex of fires. This fire started as a series of smaller fires west of Quesnel, two of which were notable in their own right, the Baezaeko River Fire, and the Tautri Lake Complex. These fires merged August 18, 2017, along with the Chezacut Fire and the Arc Mountain Fire to form the Nazko Complex at over 432,000 hectares. This single fire was later renamed the Plateau Complex centred on the Chilcotin Plateau. Overall this behemoth fire covered a combined area of 545,151 hectares, making it the largest fire in B.C.'s recorded history (roughly the same size as Prince Edward Island). This fire was the result of nearly 20 separate fires merging. State of emergency On July 7, a provincial state of emergency was declared by Todd Stone, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, on behalf of the Government of British Columbia. The state of emergency was extended on July 19 and again on August 4, and again on August 18, and again on September 1. This was the first state of emergency for British Columbia in 14 years, and the longest state of emergency in the province's history. On September 15, the state of emergency finally ended at midnight. Cause and contributing factors A combination of dry lightning and human-caused fires were responsible for starting the 2017 BC wildfires. Human-caused climate change also played a significant role in the fires. Human-caused fires have been both accidental and intentional, all wildfires in BC are investigated to determine the fire origin and cause. Fire bans and restrictions have been put in place to limit further human-caused fires. A study involving researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada found that climate change played a major role in the fires. They concluded that ‚Äúthe risk factors affecting the event, and the area burned itself, were made substantially greater by anthropogenic climate change... and that anthropogenic climate change increased the area burned by a factor of 7‚Äì11.‚Äù Heat waves and minimal rainfall throughout the province leading up to the wildfires had dried out vegetation and soil. As well, pine forests containing large amounts of dead pine trees due to the mountain pine beetle was optimal fuel for fires. With consideration of these contributing factors, most areas of BC were rated as being at extreme or high risk of fire danger. The wildfires quickly grew in size as a direct result of strong winds with some regions reaching high winds of up to 70 km/h. On July 4, a car crash on Highway 1 near Cherry Creek caused a 15-hectare fire that was later contained with a crew of 47 fire personnel, 11 planes and a helicopter. Incidents More than 39,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and 30,000 cattle have been threatened. The wildfires have reportedly destroyed over 300 buildings ranging from homes and barns to commercial structures. On July 15, a fire helicopter under contract to BC Wildfire Service crashed in the Chilcotin region during firefighting duties. The only crew on board was a pilot who suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Resources As of August 13, 3,906 firefighters have been deployed to fight the fires including 647 out of province personnel and 1,606 contractors. Crews are fighting the fires with assistance of 233 helicopters and airplanes. In addition, 50 Australian firefighters, 80 Fire and Emergency New Zealand firefighters and 108 fire personnel from Mexico have come to BC's aid. Over 15 reception centres were opened province wide by Emergency Social Services. In addition, five cities ranging from Surrey to Williams Lake had opened group lodging centres for evacuees. The Red Cross has opened support centres in Kamloops and Williams Lake and is providing assistance to those affected by the fires with funds from donors, the federal government and the province of BC as promised by Premier Christy Clark. On September 5, 2017, Canadian Minister of Agriculture Lawrence MacAulay announced that farmers and ranchers impacted by the wildfires would be provided $20 million in aid by various levels of government.

Early life  Govind Solegaonkar was born in 1912 at Sehore in Madhya Pradesh. He was introduced to art at a very early age. He received his initial lessons at home from his father who was a student of Sir J.J. School (1905) and was part of Ajanta copying team from J.J. School. While schooling, G. M. Solegaonkar simultaneously took training in drawing, painting at \\"Devlalikar Institute\\" in Indore. (1927) Devlalikar too was a past student of Sir J.J. School of Art. Thus the academic influence of J.J. School started molding G. M. Solegaonkar much before he himself joined the school. In 1928 an important incident took place which exerted an indirect influence of Revivalists Movement on his mind. ‚Äô‚ÄôPravasi Vanga Sahitya Sammelan\\" was held in Indore. On this occasion, an exhibition of the paintings from all over India was held. G.M. Solegaonkar participated in it and was felicitated with silver medal at the hands of Lady Dobson, member of London Royal Academy. The program of the Parishad included among other items the lectures by Dr. Cousins, on Indian Art. In his lectures, he gave references from Havell's book, \\"The Ideals of Indian Art\\". The lectures inspired him arousing curiosity about the qualities of Indian Art and its philosophical background; which he pursued all through. He had excelled in Elementary & Intermediate Drawing examinations. During this period he started painting portraits. The British soldiers at Mhow Contonment wanted to send their small portraits to their beloved and were very happy to get their miniature portraits done by G.M. Solegaonkar. He joined Sir J.J. School of Art - Mumbai, in 1930, for Diploma in painting & completed it in 1933 in first class. He continued to win many awards during this period. He was appointed a Fellow at Sir J.J. School of Art ‚Äì Mumbai for 1935‚Äì1936 in Mural Department.  Career  While a student his award-winning painting \\"Love Pilgrimage\\" was exhibited in an exhibition at the Burlington Gallery, London. In 1935, he won the Gold medal of Bombay Art Society for his painting ‚ÄòMahiyari‚Äô[4][5] Presently the painting is with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya - Mumbai (then Prince of Wales Museum). The same was on display in recent exhibition organised as tribute to G. Solomon, Dean Sir J.J. School of Art. (http://www.csmvs.in/about-us/press-room/press- release/210-pravaha.html) For next twenty years, he continued to receive many awards, prizes and trophies from Simla Fine Art Society, Art Society of India, Bombay Art Society and in various Art exhibitions in India. During an exhibition at Fine art Society, Simla. His poster painting 'Ajanta Frescos' was awarded a special prize by the publicity department of Indian Railways. Post independence, a planning committee was formed to draw detailed plan to decorate the Parliament House of India, with paintings of eminent artists depicting great moments in the history of this country. G. M. Solegaonkar was selected to create a panel painting. His mural titled Bhojshala continues to be displayed at the Indian Parliament House. He held his solo exhibitions in Jehangir Art Gallery in 1954, 1957 and 1958. G. M. Solegaonkar visited Europe in 1958 particularly England, Belgium, Holland. He spent about two years there, studying the paintings and sculptures by visiting various galleries and exhibitions. His work during this period contained numerous paintings in his own style and predominantly with various Indian subjects. He held many exhibitions in Europe, with three of them being held in Belgium. On return from Europe visit, he served Art Society of India as President in 1962. He held his exhibitions in Jehangir Art Gallery in 1962 and in Taj Art Gallery in 1970. He spent years researching the master key and technique deployed in paintings at Ajanta and Bagh Caves . As he could see that this invaluable cultural heritage was showing signs of getting ravaged by onslaught of time, he had a strong desire to make this treasure available for the future generations. With this background he had planned a detailed scheme, of having a replica of Ajanta caves. The scheme would provide training to the art- students as well as patronage to painters. He had commenced corresponding with Government authorities. The then Education Minister Madhukarrao Chaudhary and Defense Minister Yashwantrao Chavan were favorably inclined towards the scheme and had indicated their consent. Unfortunately, due to paucity of funds with Maharashtra Government, this scheme could not see the light of the day. In July 1971, an exhibition of 40 of his paintings was held in India House, London. He continued to wield his brush and pallet till the day he breathed his last on 5 January 1986. Subsequently, his works have been auctioned by several art auction houses such as Christie's and SaffronArt.  Style  The following paragraph taken from his diary, sets tone to his Art-journey: \\"India had art of long standing. The artistic value need not necessarily depend upon fulfilling the standards set by the latest fashion or theory or values current in Europe. Our artistic activity came to a standstill practically with the loss of freedom and cultural decline. England forced upon India, European art ideals, methods and values. It is not that European culture has done India no good. Some great and eternal values like freedom, individual and collective, for general progress are the elements bound to lead men to progress. Let us not be servile imitators of the dead past or living present of Europe. Let us find out whether we have anything to give ‚Äì contribute. Let us free ourselves from the false notion that is holding on to Indian technique, period or school. This is the way to express the soul of India in art forms.\\" Similarly following quote from his diary defines his approach to technique and style: \\"Mastery over technique gives discipline to the artist. The discipline, the control of the material which the mastery over the technique gives is very precious..... Mere technique is not art. The artist must learn and then forget the technique.\\" Throughout his life he experimented with different styles. He tried various types of subjects from figurative compositions in Indian decorative style, genre, portraits, still-life, outdoor scenes - landscapes, abstract as well as non-objective paintings. All of these showed a continuous handling of color and forms with new experiments. Style in The Early Period He started with portraits, even before formal training in J. J. School of Art. He was successful in bringing perfect likeness and his portraits were known for his masterly treatment in realistic rendering. In J.J. School, he was introduced to the painting style based on academic realism. All the same, there was a deep influence of the great frescoes of Ajanta and especially Bagh Caves on his mind from very early age when he was in Indore. Influenced by Havell's book & Dean Gladston Solomon he ardently followed Bombay Revivalism and his work represented the Indian art. The fascination about Indian art and its decorative style was combined with the academic training of Bombay School. File:'Dattatreya' by G. M. Solegaonkar.jpg Iconographic paintings - ' Dattatreya', 'Trimurti', 'Samudra Manthan' These paintings illustrate his mastery over pure, delicate, rhythmic yet powerful line acquired by his in depth study of Frescos Art. These were a very remarkable example of wall decoration on traditional lines. He experimented illusionistic paintings in the academic style and made compositions in Indian decorative style. His work in the early period of his career was earmarked as replete with Iconographic paintings making subtle use of different styles. He belonged to the transition period. He was known to be the first modern artist from J.J. School of Art. Given below are the illustrations of expert use of different styles as seen in some of his prize winning work during the early period ‚Äì left ‚ÄòDadhi Manthan‚Äô (Churning) - In the art world this work was distinctively noticed then for its theme. It depicted artistically the rhythmic movement of churning and included minute details such as the flowing movement of a background curtain etc. The color combination showed traces of Neo Rajput style. ‚ÄòLove Pilgrimage‚Äô was a large decorative panel of the divine couple - Shiva & his consort Uma and captured their lilting movement. This painting using hastmudra ‚Äì hand gestures influenced by Ajanta frescos was considered an example of obsession with the Indian decorative style and ingeneous mannerism. It recorded a new enterprise in decorative line and color and won the ‚ÄòNizam silver medal‚Äô for best work by student of any art school in India in Simla Fine Art exhibition. This painting was much appreciated for its line work reminding iconography of ancient Indian Art on the backdrop of Ancient Buddhist Art. It was eventually selected for the exhibition of Modern Indian Art arranged by the Indian Society of London at the New Burlington Galleries (1934). Chandra Aradhana‚Äô had semblance of Mughal style. 114x114px Mahiyari (1935 - Gold medal winning painting) This painting noted for its originality was a strikingly successful attempt to present a truly Indian subject using western style of painting. It was the first time that an effort was made to use Cubism which was an emerging French school of painting then. The beautifully executed face with lost look in her dreaming eyes and expressive face of one waiting for her beloved were captured effectively. Conducive attractive colours, setting Sunrays in the background, play of light & shadow on Mahiyari's multi coloured costume, western proportionality, colour scheme in Rajput style and the light but soft background of the sunlit buildings set off the graceful figure made this an aesthetic masterpiece of art. Critic Karl Khandalawala has noted - 'This painting presented an excellent illustration of how certain principles of Modern French Art can with great advantage be employed by the Indian artist without losing his individuality or becoming an imitator.' This artist was not tied down to the rigid principles of reality, which was the chief factor of the paintings of the Bombay school. After realistic phase, he tried to use bold impressionistic strokes. He simplified the forms by omitting unnecessary details - thus deviating from the traditional style executed with microscopic details. He used broad, bold and confident brush-strokes in the paintings. His handling showed rapidity, boldness and precision. For this purpose sometimes he used even flat tones and simplified forms. Through all his work he continued experimenting with feeling of space, arrangement of forms, aspects of light & color eventually to create a good design while keeping the effect of space intact. His efforts are revealed in his line, in individual figures or in the overall design. The experiments with space involved the use of unusual views and levels. By training and as his core strength he was a muralist. In the paintings or line art, irrespective of size or color, distinctive features of mural paintings can be noticed. His work exhibits mastery over line and its spontaneity created a sense of volume in his drawing. His paintings show a powerful color-sense and a decorative quality.  Abstract Paintings  In his work there is integration between the past and the present. His work displays vital interest in Present - modern trends of the contemporary world, sustained with deeply rooted understanding of the past heritage - inspirations from Frescos of Ajanta & Bagh. He reformed his original style taking cognizance of new references and new directions. Thus started his foray into abstract paintings. Exposure to modern works of art from the west left impressionistic influences with novel modes in his work. He achieved effects of vast space and good design through interesting arrangement of simplified forms and color orchestration. With his urge for innovation, he continued experimenting in treatment of form & arrangements. His approach to abstract art was deep rooted in a stylized realism. He adopted specialties of modern paintings to create visual art. His work was marked with his perspective, fine sense of pattern and geometrical rhythm.Landscapes Fascinated by the beauty of nature, he tried to explore it through his landscapes throughout his life. His landscapes showed a new view to reveal the beauty of nature. Most of his landscapes show the panoramic view revealing the vast space. His landscapes show simplified forms and sure, bold brush-strokes together with pleasant color-schemes derived from natural pigments. He chiefly experimented in aspects of light, space and color. Though his training emphasized on academic realism, his technique of landscape painting showed the influence of the Impressionism and Post-impressionism. Color His approach to color was scientific and his color-scheme shows strength and vitality. Limited palette and skillful use of greys derived from different colors was the result of inspiration from the ancient muralists of India. Particularly the cave paintings of Bagh provided inspiration for his experiments in tempera colors. He prepared his own colors from the pigments. It is for this reason his color scheme had become a distinguishing feature of his art work. He used water colors in opaque manner (gouache technique) like the Indian miniature painters. He used indigenous earth colors for chromatic luminosity.  Paintings  Some paintings by Mr Solegaonkar: File:46 - G. M. Solegaonkar - Landscape.jpg File:43 - G. M.

Actress and singer Diahann Carroll portrayed Julia Baker, a recently widowed black nurse, with Lloyd Nolan in a supporting role as Baker's white boss and Marc Copage as her 6-year-old son, Corey. Another child actor, Michael Link, appeared as Corey's white friend, Earl J. Waggedorn. Hal Kanter was the creator producer of a show that was generally praised by television critics. One critic noted that the situation comedy \\"is very low pressure, admirably without a laugh track, and weaves in warmth, bite and a social needle... of course it must deal at times with black-white relationships, but it is not, and does not pretend to be, a social tract,\\" adding, \\"It has been suggested by some that 'Julia' is not going to give a true representation of Negro life, and that may very well be so. On the other hand it might be argued that white situation comedies hardly give a true representation of white life in the United States.

It was located north of his South Shore estate, known as Indian Neck Hall, which later became LaSalle Military Academy. The windmill was demolished in 2004‚Äì2005. History The Bourne Windmill was built in 1911 by Frederick Gilbert \\"Commodore\\" Bourne, and designed by noted architect Alfred Hopkins. Part of the Bourne Dairy Farm, the windmill works were built by the Andrew J. Corcoran Company and supplied water for the dairy farm, farmhouse, fountains and fire hydrants. It was noteworthy in its height, construction and artistic design. It stood approximately 100' high with windmill blades 25 feet in diameter, and adorned with terracotta ram's heads encircling the tower. It featured a unique octagonal design constructed of reinforced concrete pillars with terracotta blocks between, and smooth stucco on the exterior. The upper portion of the tower housed a large metal water tank and the lower portion was used as a silo. By the 1970s, the surrounding farm buildings fell into disrepair, damaged by neglect and vandalism and were demolished around 1975. The windmill continued to be neglected through the 1980s and became a home to bats and owls, and a spooky hangout for local teenagers. In 1989, the surrounding property was redeveloped into an age- restricted residential community and the windmill underwent a garish cosmetic makeover. The top was retrofitted with a barn roof and faux Dutch-style blades replacing the original American farm design, and the tower exterior was painted pastel yellow to match the vinyl siding of the new homes. It was eventually demolished in 2004‚Äì2005 after engineering reports estimated the cost of maintaining the structure to be too expensive, despite its status as an historic site.

It was replaced in favor of the more conservative Mercedes-Benz T2 after that company took over Hanomag- Henschel. The F-series badge was also used on the smaller \\"Harburger Transporter\\" as well as on some rebadged Mercedes-Benz T2 models. Model History Hanomag F55 double-cab Rheinstahl-Hanomag AG developed an entirely new range to replace the heavier models in the Hanomag Kurier/Garant/Markant range, and to fill the gap between the old Tempo products and the heavier Hanomag trucks. It was a simple ladder frame design. The designer, Frenchman Louis Lucien Lepoix, was also responsible for a number of designs for Magirus- Deutz and B√ºssing. The F-series was available in several weight capacities ranging from the F45 to the F76. The numbers ending in a \\"5\\" received four- cylinder engines; those ending in a \\"6\\" a six-cylinder. The engines were all inline diesels from the all-new D-100 range which was simultaneously introduced in Hanomag's tractor lineup. The F66 and F76's straight-six unit produces at 3400 rpm. The smallest F45 has . In addition to trucks, the F76 was also available as a tractor unit. In 1969 the air-sprung F76 LL was introduced, and the name was changed to Hanomag-Henschel subsequent to the amalgamation of the two branches. There was also a heavier yet F86 introduced later, with a . Rheinstahl, the owners of both Hanomag and Henschel, merged the companies in 1969 and sold a controlling interest in the resulting Hanomag-Henschel company to Mercedes-Benz. Rheinstahl suffered further financial setbacks and sold the remainder of the company to Mercedes-Benz at the end of 1970. Mercedes-Benz kept building certain parts of the Hanomag- Henschel lineup, in areas where Mercedes-Benz themselves were weak, but the F-series was thus discontinued in 1973, after only six years on the market. The Bremen factory had begun producing the smaller \\"Harburger Transporter\\" (F20-F35) alongside the F-series trucks in 1969 and continued to do so after the larger trucks were discontinued. The plant went on to build Mercedes-Benz' \\"Bremer Transporter\\". Other F-series vehicles While the original F-series was only offered as a truck, panel van and minibus versions of the Mercedes- Benz T2 (built in D√ºsseldorf) were also sold with Hanomag-Henschel F-series badging, beginning in 1970. These used the headlights from the F and a Hanomag-Henschel grille. This badge-engineered version continued to be available into the latter half of the 1970s. The smaller \\"Harburger Transporter\\", thus called because it was built in Harburg, Hamburg, was also sold with Hanomag (and Hanomag-Henschel) F-series badging, F20, F25, or F35 depending on the weight rating. Based on an older design by Tempo, it was built as a Hanomag-Henschel until 1975 and as a Mercedes-Benz until 1977.

Mononutu gained his sense of Indonesian nationalism during his post-secondary studies in the Netherlands. In the early years of the Indonesian government, he served as Information Minister and was the first Ambassador of Indonesia to China. He later became Rector of Hasanuddin University. Early life A young Mononutu with his parents Arnold Isaac Zacharias Mononutu was born in Manado on 4 December 1896 to Karel Charles Wilson Mononutu and Agustina van der Slot.Nalenan (1981), p. 9. Both his father and grandfather were prominent figures in their time. His father was a civil servant or ambtenaar (nl) in the Dutch East Indies colonial administration. His grandfather (also named Arnold Mononutu) was the first Minahasan to complete studies at the school for the training of native physicians (STOVIA or School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen) in Batavia (now Jakarta).Nalenan (1981), p. 5. When Mononutu was two years old, his father was assigned a position in Gorontalo. Four younger siblings were born in Gorontalo, but sadly all four died when they were between five and six months old. In 1903, Mononutu went to the Dutch language elementary school (ELS or Europeesche Lagere School (nl)) in Gorontalo.Nalenan (1981), p. 10. He continued his studies at the ELS in Manado after his father was reassigned to a position in Manado. In 1913, Mononutu went to the Dutch secondary school (HBS or Hogere burgerschool (nl)) in Batavia where he met and became friends with AA Maramis (also from Minahasa) and Achmad Subardjo.Nalenan (1981), p. 15. Time in Europe Mononutu with others officers of Perhimpunan Indonesia in 1925 In 1920, Mononutu headed to Europe to start his studies in the Netherlands. After a couple of years of taking preparatory courses to enroll in a university, he decided to enroll in The Hague Academy of International Law or Acad√©mie de droit international de La Haye in The Hague.Nalenan (1981), p. 55. Mononutu initially did not have nationalistic ideals. However, after attending the association for Indonesian students in the Netherlands or Indische Vereeniging or Perhimpunan Indonesia, Mononutu began to realize the nationalism of Indonesia. He became more involved in the organization and was elected as vice president, the same period in which Mohammad Hatta was elected as treasurer.Nalenan (1981), p. 48. When Soekiman Wirjosandjojo was president of the organization, Mononutu was asked to become a representative of Indische Vereeniging among the student organizations in Paris.Nalenan (1981), p. 58. During his time in Paris, the Dutch Political Intelligence Department or Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst became suspicious of Mononutu's activities. The colonial government in Indonesia spread false rumors to his father that he was being sympathetic to the communists. His father was threaten to be removed from his position if he continued to send money to Mononutu.Nalenan (1981), p. 64. When his father stopped sending money to Mononutu, he became dependent on his Indonesian friends. He returned to the Netherlands from France and was allowed to stay with Ali Sastroamidjojo and his family.Nalenan (1981), p. 71. Upon secretly receiving money from his father through his uncle who was travelling to the Netherlands, Mononutu was able to pay all his debts and return home to Indonesia in September 1927.Nalenan (1981), p. 76. Return to Indonesia Upon returning to Indonesia, Mononutu was immediately involved in the local nationalistic efforts. He became a member of the newly formed Indonesian National Party or Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI).Nalenan (1981), p. 90. He also met its founder, Sukarno, for the first time.Nalenan (1981), p. 95. Mononutu rented a room in the same house as Suwirjo and Sugondo Djojopuspito both of whom were leaders of the Indonesian Students Association or Persatuan Pelajar Pelajar Indonesia.Nalenan (1981), p. 79. This organization was part of the Second Youth Congress in 1928 that produced the Youth Pledge or Sumpah Pemuda. This pledge proclaimed the three ideals of one motherland, one nation, and one language. The future Indonesian national anthem Indonesia Raya by Wage Rudolf Supratman was first heard in this venue. Mononutu had started work for a Japanese oil exploration company called Mitsui Buissan Kaisha, but would decide to work for much less pay at the newly established People's College or Perguruan Rakyat.Nalenan (1981), p. 101. He managed and taught courses in schools established by Perguruan Rakyat. Other instructors included Mohammad Yamin and Gunawan Mangunkusumo (the brother of Tjipto Mangunkusumo).Nalenan (1981), p. 104. The schools had a total of around 300 students enrolled. In 1930, Mononutu had to leave his position at Perguruan Rakyat and return to Manado, because he received word that his mother was sick. Time in Manado and Ternate Mononutu would stay in Manado for 12 years from 1930 to 1942. During this time, he became the director of a copra cooperative. The cooperative had around 500 members who were scattered throughout the regions of Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow. Mononutu was able to secure credit from the People's General Credit Bank or Algemene Volkscredietbank (now Bank Rakyat Indonesia) to cover the debts of the copra farmers. This allowed the farmers to sell their copra to the cooperative, which offered more stabil and standardized prices. The copra was in turn exported through the Nationale Handelsbank, a Dutch bank that was established to finance trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.Nalenan (1981), pp. 111-112. At the beginning of the Japanese occupation in 1942, Mononutu was sought by the Japanese because of his nationalistic stance and relationship with nationalist organizations. With the help of a sympathetic Japanese named Yamanishi, Mononutu fled to the island of Ternate (the northern part of the Maluku Islands) and remained there until the end of the occupation.Nalenan (1981), p. 120. Involvement in the State of East Indonesia Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX After hearing of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence that was proclaimed in 1945, Mononutu focused his efforts to help the people of North Maluku to determine the best response to the proclamation. He was one of the individuals who established a political organization called the Unity of Indonesia or Persatuan Indonesia. A newspaper called the Tower of Independence or Menara Merdeka was published to promote the ideals of Persatuan Indonesia.Prisma (1983), p. 110. The paper promoted a pro-republic message and criticized efforts by the Dutch to establish a separate state apart from the recently proclaimed Republic of Indonesia. Efforts by the Dutch to find a federal solution for Indonesia included the establishment of the State of East Indonesia or Negara Indonesia Timur (NIT) in 1946. Mononutu became a member of the NIT parliament and headed the group of parliament members who were pro- republic.Prisma (1983), p. 110.Nalenan (1981), p. 181. He focused his efforts to persuade other members of parliament to support the notion of unifying NIT with the Republic of Indonesia. After the Dutch military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia called Operation Product or Agresi Militer Belanda I in 1947, Mononutu established the Unified Struggle for Indonesian Independence or Gabungan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan Indonesia.Sudarmanto (2006), p. 420. This organization sought to highlight the actions of the Dutch to keep Indonesia as its colony. In February 1948, he led a delegation of NIT officials to visit and meet with the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia in Yogyakarta.Atmakusumah (2011), p. 315. In 1949, NIT became a constituent of the newly formed United States of Indonesia or Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS), which was then dissolved on 17 August 1950 and replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia. Information Minister Mononutu giving a speech in Garut Mononutu with Sukarno in Purwodadi Mononutu was appointed Information Minister in the Indonesian government on three separate occasions: * In the Republic of the United States of Indonesia Cabinet from 20 December 1949 to 6 September 1950Feith (1962), p. 47. * In the Sukiman Cabinet from 27 April 1951 to April 1952Feith (1962), p. 180. * In the Wilopo Cabinet from 3 April 1952 to 30 Juli 1953Feith (1958), p. 94. During his time as information minister, several regions in Indonesia were rocked by rebellious uprisings including in West Java (Legion of Ratu Adil), South Sulawesi (by Andi Aziz), and Maluku (by Chris Soumokil). Mononutu along with Sukarno visited these regions and in large open-air meetings promoted the ideal of a unified nation.Nalenan (1981), p. 202. Rector of Hasanuddin University In 1960, Mononutu was asked by Sukarno to become rector of Hasanuddin University. In the five years as rector, the student population grew from 4000 students to 8000 students. When he started, the university only had three faculties: economics, law, and medicine. The university would add six more faculties during his tenure: agriculture, animal sciences, engineering, literature, sciences, and social politics.Nalenan (1981), p. 239. Honors On 15 February 1961, Mononutu was awarded the Bintang Mahaputera Utama, the highest honor given to a civilian by the Indonesian government.

After losing his first two starts at age three, he rebounded to win the next three, including the Grade I Belmont Derby and Secretariat Stakes. He then finished third in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic before finishing ninth in the Breeders' Cup Turf. After recovering from a bout of colic, he made his four-year-old debut in June 2018 in the Poker Stakes, winning in track-record time. In his next start as the favorite in the Arlington Million, he was pulled up after taking a bad step, but he rebounded to win the Woodbine Mile in September. Background Oscar Performance was foaled in Kentucky at Mill Ridge Farm. He was bred by Mrs. Jerry Amerman and races for Amerman Racing, owned by Amerman and her husband John. Oscar Performance was sired by Kitten's Joy, the U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse of 2004 whose wins included the Secretariat Stakes and Joe Hirsch Turf Classic, plus a second place in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Unusually for a leading North American sire, his best offspring are also turf specialists, including Big Blue Kitten, Bobby's Kitten, Real Solution and Stephanie's Kitten. Oscar Performance's dam, Devine Actress, was a stakes winner for Amerman Racing who had previously produced a stakes winning full brother to Oscar Performance named Oscar Nominated. \\"I remember him as a very attractive foal, the kind that you hope for\\", said Headley Bell of Mill Ridge Farm. \\"He continued to go that way as he grew. He was more of an alpha, but he stayed out of trouble.\\" Oscar Performance is trained by Brian A. Lynch. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Oscar Performance made his first start on the turf course at Saratoga in a maiden special weight race on July 23, 2016, finishing fifth after trailing the field early and making a mild rally in the stretch. In his second start on August 20, he instead went to the early lead and continued to draw away from the field, eventually winning by lengths. The performance caught the attention of many turf writers, earning him the \\"TDN Rising Star\\" designation from the Thoroughbred Daily News. Oscar Performance made his graded stakes debut at Belmont Park on October 1 in the Grade III Pilgrim Stakes. Over a yielding turf course, he went to the lead and set a comfortable pace before kicking clear in the stretch to win by six lengths. The win earned Oscar Performance a berth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf, where he was made the 6‚Äì1 third choice in the betting. He settled in second behind a strong early pace set by Wellabled, then moved to the lead on the far turn. Down the stretch, he opened up a comfortable lead then withstood a late run by Lancaster Bomber to win by lengths. It was the first win at the Breeders' Cup for Lynch and jockey Jos√© Ortiz. =2017: three-year-old season= Oscar Performance was given some time off then resumed workouts in February 2017. He made his first start as a three-year-old on April 7 in the Transylvania Stakes at Keeneland. He tracked the early pace in third place but lacked his usual response when asked to run in the stretch and finished third. In his next start in the American Stakes at Churchill Downs, he faded to last after setting the early pace. Lynch later attributed the losses to the soft turf courses in Kentucky that spring. John Amerman also thought that the colt did not respond well to the raceday medication Lasix (furosemide), which was administered for the first and only time before the American Stakes. Oscar Performance returned to form on June 3 in the Pennine Ridge Stakes at Belmont Park, where he took the lead soon after the start and won by lengths. He put in a similar performance when winning the Belmont Derby on July 8 by two lengths in front running fashion. In his next start in the Secretariat Stakes at Arlington Park on August 12, he faced a strong field including three European challengers and several local stakes winners. This time, he stalked the early pace set by Sonic Boom and then drew off in the stretch to win by lengths. \\"You're never confident until the finish line, but they were very good horses\\", said John Amerman. \\"We're delighted Jose [Ortiz] could ride so well and beat them.\\" On September 30, he faced older horses for the first time in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at a distance of miles. He raced close to the early pace set by Converge but could not match the finishing kick of Beach Patrol and finished third. He faced even more daunting competition in the Breeders' Cup Turf on November 4, where the European contingent included defending champion Highland Reel. Oscar Performance's best strategy was summed up by sportswriter Steve Haskin as \\"go to the front and let him run.\\" Oscar Performance set a moderate pace for the first mile, tracked by Beach Patrol and Highland Reel. Turning for home, Beach Patrol launched his bid and passed Oscar Performance in mid stretch, only to be passed near the wire by longshot Talismanic. Oscar Performance weakened in the last furlong to finish ninth. =2018: four-year-old season= Oscar Performance's return to the track was delayed by a bout of colic and did not make his four-year-old debut until June 17, 2018 in the Poker Stakes at Belmont Park. He stalked the early pace, started his move on the final turn and pulled away down the stretch to win by lengths. His time for the one-mile race was 1:31.23, breaking the track record set by Elusive Quality in 1998. \\"Absolutely thrilled with his comeback effort\\", said Lynch. \\"He did it with authority and came back with a very fast time. That's a long-standing track record to break, so to have him do that off the layoff makes you look forward to the rest of the year.\\" The time also tied the North-American record set by Mandurah at Monmouth Park in 2010. Oscar Performance at the 2018 Breeders' Cup Oscar Performance made his next step on August 11 in the Arlington Million, going off as the 2-1 favorite. He broke slowly and settled into third place during the early running. Around the far turn, he was bumped by Robert Bruce, the eventual race winner, then recovered his stride and started to make up ground. However, he slowed during the stretch drive after taking a bad step and was pulled up by Ortiz. He walked into the track ambulance without evident distress and subsequently checked out sound. On September 15, Oscar Performance entered the Woodbine Mile in Toronto. The field included several well-regarded shippers from across North America and Europe, but Oscar Performance was left as the sole speed horse in the field when La Sardane scratched. After breaking slowly, Ortiz urged him to the lead, then slowed down the pace, completing the first half mile in 48.78 seconds. Ortiz then released Oscar Performance, who ran the second half mile in 44.44 seconds on his way to a convincing victory. \\"I was really emotional past the wire because this is one of my favorite horses\\", said Ortiz. \\"He gave me my first Breeders' Cup win and to see him last time loading up back to the barn was painful for me. I'm just very happy he's back and back on form that is at the highest level.\\" The Woodbine Mile provided a \\"Win and You're In\\" berth in the Breeders' Cup Mile, held November 3 at Churchill Downs. Oscar Performance broke slowly and was never a factor in the race, finishing last in the field of fourteen. Retirement Oscar Performance was retired to stud at Mill Ridge Farm, where he will stand the 2019 season for $20,000.

He was killed in Jumada al-Thani 720 AH (July/August 1320). First reign, in partnership with Rumaythah Humaydah was one of 30 sons of Abu Numayy I, who ruled Mecca between 1254 and 1301. He and his brother Rumaythah were proclaimed as joint emirs in Safar 701 AH (October 1301), two days before Abu Numayy's death. They were initially opposed by a faction of the ashraf who supported their brothers Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah. Humaydah emerged predominant and imprisoned Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah. However, they managed to escape and when the hajj season arrived they gained the favor of the Egyptian emirs, chief among them Baybars al-Jashnakir. Consequently, in Dhu al-Hijjah 701 AH (August 1302), after the completion of the hajj rites, Baybars arrested Humaydah and Rumaythah, and installed their brothers to the throne. Baybars returned to Cairo in Muharram 702 AH, with Humaydah and Rumaythah in chains.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/134‚Äì136 In 703 AH the brothers were released from prison. The sultan al-Nasir Muhammad dressed them in traditional Mamluk costume with kalafatah caps of zarkash (brocade). Humaydah initially refused to wear the dress before he was threatened with imprisonment. Thereafter the brothers were granted stipends and joined the ranks of the sultan's emirs. They rode with the sultan on the maydan (parade grounds), and Humaydah played polo with the sultan.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al- war√°, 3/137‚Äì138 Second reign, in partnership with Rumaythah In 704 AH the shaykh Nasr al-Manbiji interceded for Humaydah and Rumaythah to forego Mamluk attire in favor of their own Hejazi dress. Later that year the sultan reappointed them to the emirate of Mecca, as he had become displeased with their brothers. They accompanied the annual hajj caravan from Cairo, and in Dhu al-Hijjah 704 AH (July 1305), after the completion of the hajj rites, Baybars al-Jashnakir arrested Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah and installed Humaydah and Rumaythah to the throne.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/140‚Äì142 Humaydah and Rumaythah initially acted justly and instituted popular policies including repeals of some of the mukus taxes. However in the following years they became guilty of various misdeeds and abuses. As a result, during the hajj of 710 AH (1311) they left Mecca to avoid an Egyptian force that was sent against them. In 712 AH (1313) they again abandoned Mecca when al-Nasir himself performed the pilgrimage with a large army.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al- war√°, 3/145‚Äì149 Finally, in Shawwal 713 AH (January/February 1314) al-Nasir dispatched an army to install Abu al-Ghayth to the throne, with 320 Mamluk cavalry and 500 horsemen from the Banu Husayn of Medina. The Egyptian emirs were Sayf al-Din Taqsuba al-Nasiri, Wali of Qus and commander of the army, Sayf al-Din Baktamur, Sarim al-Din Saruja al-Husami, and Ala al-Din Aydughdi al-Khwarizmi. They were joined from Damascus by the emir Sayf al-Din Balaban al-Tatari. When Humaydah and Rumaythah heard of the army's approach they fled towards Haly Bani Ya'qub. After the hajj the army remained in Mecca for about two months to support Abu al-Ghayth.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/150‚Äì152 Third reign After the Egyptian army departed Mecca, Humaydah gathered his forces and captured the city, inflicting a loss on Abu al-Ghayth of around 15 foot soldiers and over 20 horsemen. Humaydah sent a tribute to al-Nasir in an attempt to regain his favor, but it was not accepted and his messenger was imprisoned. The sultan sent reinforcements to Abu al-Ghayth and ordered the Emir of Medina to assist him. On Tuesday, 4 Dhu al-Hijjah 714 AH (11 March 1315), Humaydah faced and defeated Abu al-Ghayth's larger force near Mecca. Abu al-Ghayth was injured in the battle and captured, then executed on Humaydah's orders at Khayf Bani Shadid.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/152‚Äì153 In Sha'ban 715 AH (November 1315) al-Nasir dispatched Rumaythah to Mecca with an army led by the emirs Majd al-Din Damurkhan ibn Qaraman and Sayf al-Din Taydamur al-Jamadar. Six days before the army's arrival, Humaydah loaded up a hundred camels with money and goods, burned what was left in the castle at Wadi Marr, and destroyed two thousand date palms. Then he made making his way to al-Khalf wal-Khulayf, a castle six days journey from Mecca, and sought refuge with its master. The Egyptian army reached Mecca with Rumaythah on 15 Ramadan (13 December). After two weeks they proceeded to al- Khalf wal-Khulayf, where they looted the castle and seized Humaydah's wealth. His son of twelve was captured and turned over to Rumaythah, while Humaydah himself escaped to Iraq.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/153‚Äì154 Alliance with the Ilkhanate In 716 AH, Humaydah presented himself at the court of the Ilkhan Uljaytu seeking military assistance against Rumaythah. Uljaytu provided Humaydah an army of several thousand Mongols and Arabs under the command of Sayyid Talib al-Dilqandi to bring the Hejaz under Ilkhanid control. Uljaytu, who was a convert to Twelver Shi'ism, also planned to exhume the bodies of the caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar from their graves in Medina. However, soon after the expedition passed Basra they received news of Uljaytu's death, and a large part of the army deserted.

Rumaythah informed al- Nasir, and the sultan wrote to Humaydah that if he came to Egypt he would be granted safety and pardon, but he could not stay in the Hejaz. In Rabi I (May 1317) al-Nasir sent the emirs Sayf al-Din Aytamush al-Muhammadi and Sayf al- Din Bahadur al-Sa'di to bring Humaydah and his companions back to Egypt. When they met Humaydah, he complained that he did not have provisions for the journey. They provided him whatever he needed, but afterwards Humaydah and his companions disappeared, so the emirs returned to Cairo empty-handed.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/156‚Äì157 Fourth reign After the departure of the hajj, either in Dhu al-Hijjah 717 AH or Muharram 718 AH (February or March 1318), Humaydah overthrew Rumaythah with the assent of his slaves. He replaced the name of al-Nasir in the khutbah with that of Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, son of Uljaytu. The Ilkhanid khutbah was short-lived, however, for in late Rabi I (May 1318) al-Nasir sent an army which restored Rumaythah to the throne.al- Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/158‚Äì160 Notes References * * Category:1320 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Sharifs of Mecca Category:Middle Eastern royalty Category:14th-century Arabs Category:14th- century rulers ","title":"Humaydah ibn Abi Numayy"},{"id":"54887344","title":"List of lakes of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern"},{"id":"54887372","text":"Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI is the third non-fiction book by the American journalist David Grann. The book was released on April 18, 2017 by Doubleday.Time magazine listed Killers of the Flower Moon as one of its top ten non-fiction books of 2017. The book is currently planned for production as a film directed by Martin Scorsese and set to star Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Synopsis The book investigates a series of murders of wealthy Osage people that took place in Osage County, Oklahoma in the early 1920s‚Äîafter big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land. After the Osage Native Americans are awarded rights in court to the profits made from oil deposits found on their land, the Osage people prepare for receiving the wealth to which they are legally entitled from sales of their oil deposits. However, a long and complex process of custodianship is imposed upon the distribution of the profits from the sales being made for very high profits and very few if any of the Osage people see any of this money. Still, they are the legal owners of the land and its profits, which is irksome to some of the administrators of the land who have a history of poor relations with the Osage people. Those elements hostile to the Osage people then decide that they could greatly simplify their profit mongering of the oil profits by eliminating those whom they consider to be operating as the \\"middle man\\" before they can abscond with the oil profits. The Osage people are viewed as the \\"middle man\\" and a complex plot is hatched and put into place to eliminate the Osage people inheriting this wealth from oil profits on a one-by-one basis by any means possible. Officially, the count of the murdered full-blood wealthy Osage native Americans reaches at least 20, but Grann suspects that hundreds more may have been killed because of their ties to oil. The book details the newly formed FBI's investigation of the murders, as well as the eventual trial and conviction of cattleman William Hale as the mastermind behind the plot. Reception The review aggregator website Book Marks indicated that overall Killers of the Flower Moon received rave reviews from literary critics. Writing for The New York Times, Dave Eggers called the book \\"riveting\\" and wrote, \\"in these last pages, Grann takes what was already a fascinating and disciplined recording of a forgotten chapter in American history, and with the help of contemporary Osage tribe members, he illuminates a sickening conspiracy that goes far deeper than those four years of horror. It will sear your soul.\\" Sean Woods of Rolling Stone praised Grann's book, noting, \\"In his masterful new book...Grann chronicles a tale of murder, betrayal, heroism and a nation's struggle to leave its frontier culture behind and enter the modern world... Filled with almost mythic characters from our past ‚Äì stoic Texas Rangers, corrupt robber barons, private detectives, and murderous desperadoes like the Al Spencer gang ‚Äì Grann's story amounts to a secret history of the American frontier.\\" A reviewer of Publishers Weekly stated \\"New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening‚Äîand relatively unknown‚Äîspree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma during the 1920s.\\" Ed Vulliamy of The Guardian wrote, \\"The genocide by white America against Native nations during the century leading up to Grann‚Äôs period is a metaphor for humanity‚Äôs decimation of the natural world which the Natives saw as sacred. Grann‚Äôs book is a timely and disturbing chapter in the original, terrible atrocity.\\" Film adaptation The book is being adapted into a film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. It will be released theatrically by Paramount Pictures and streaming on Apple TV+. Currently, there is no release date for the film.

Aung Shwe was a member of the Burma Socialist Party before the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat. He was forced to retire from Tatmadaw in 1961 after a public disagreement with General Ne Win, on the military's long- term role in government. He then served as Burmese ambassador to France, Australia, Egypt, Spain and New Zealand from 1961 to 1975. Subsequent to his posting in Australia, He served in Egypt and then in Paris until his retirement from government service in 1975. He settled in Rangoon, where in 1988 public demonstrations erupted that eventually spread across the country.

The company was founded in 1904 by Guillaume Mo√´s (1854‚Äì1929). The company saw its greatest success between the First and Second World Wars. It survived as an independent company until 1969 when it was acquired by VMF Stork-Werkspoor Diesel of Amsterdam (now part of W√§rtsil√§).  Founding  Guillaume Mo√´s was born in 1854 in the hamlet of Bleret between Remicourt and Waremme. As a young man, he moved to Waremme where he founded a steam mill. His eldest son √âdouard as born in 1880 and at the turn of the century he developed an internal combustion engine that replaced the mill's steam engine. Guillaume's second son, Auguste (born 1882) turned out to be a talented salesman who promoted the new Mo√´s engine and was able to quickly gain orders from local factories. The mill was quickly turned over to engine manufacturing and in 1904 a new company, Ateliers Mo√´s-Freres, was set up to concentrate on the burgeoning engine business.  Pre-war years  The company found early success, building and selling several hundred of its engines each year from 1905 onwards. The company continued to expand in the years leading up to the First World War. In 1912 a spacious new factory was built in Waremme. The company suspended production at the outbreak of war, having produced more than 2500 engines.  After the First World War  In 1918, the company restarted production, with the youngest of Guillaume's sons, Paul (born 1893), joining the family firm. They expanded into a wide range of engine production, including diesel, hot-bulb and electric engines. In the early 1920s the company began production of narrow gauge locomotives using their diesel engines as motive power. These early locomotives had bodies that resembled traditional steam locomotives to encourage the adoption of this new technology. Guillaume died in 1929, and the company was taken over by his three sons. In the 1930s, the company changed its name to SA Moteurs Mo√´s, Waremme. Locomotive production expanded into specialist mining locomotives for use underground, and small standard gauge shunting locomotives. Moteurs Mo√´s developed an international reputation, selling equipment to France, Italy, the Netherlands, the Belgian Congo and Asia.  The Second World War and afterwards  1955 Moes locomotive at the Old Kiln Light Railway During the Second World War Moteurs Mo√´s reduced production, but kept operating throughout. They developed a reputation for protecting their workers during the Nazi occupation of Belgium. After the end of the War, Moteurs Mo√´s rebuilt its business, winning major government-subsidized contracts for marine engines. But, as war-surplus engines came onto the market, this business came to an end and Moteurs Mo√´s focused back onto the narrow gauge locomotive market, particularly for coal mining. In the 1960s, the Belgian coal mining industry collapsed, and with it an important market for the company. The company re-focused onto diesel engines and renamed itself Mo√´s Diesel in 1957. Paul Mo√´s died in 1967. Two years later, the company was acquired by Dutch group VMF Stork-Werkspoor Diesel, but remained as an independent division under the Mo√´s Diesel name. The division developed new hydrostatic narrow gauge locomotives, an improved mining locomotive, and a new type of standard gauge shunting locomotive. In 1993, the Mo√´s Diesel division was sold to the BIA Group of Belgium and focused on selling generators and pumps built by the Hatz company. In March 2013, the division's name was changed to Mo√´s Energy. In October 2013, all manufacturing at Waremme ceased.

Composition The IGN is composed of several different international organizations, namely: * The African Union; * The G4 nations; * The Uniting for Consensus Group (UfC), also known as the \\"Coffee Club\\"; * The L.69 Group of Developing Countries; * The Arab League; and * The Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Each group represents a different set of positions vis-a-vis reforming the United Nations Security Council. On July 27, 2016, an \\"oral decision\\" was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly by general acclamation of its members, which approved of a declaration known as the \\"elements of convergence\\" which outlined the status of the consensus reached by the members of the IGN at that time. This statement of consensus was based on a text and annex, of a year earlier. Ultimately, by adopting the \\"elements of consensus\\" document, the General Assembly decided to form an \\"Open Ended Working Group\\" to further develop a consensus position of the entire General Assembly on the issue of reforming the U.N. Security Council. This program had its origins in 1993, with successive reports in 2001 and 2007. The current agenda for this issue in the U.N. General Assembly can be found online. Positions of each group The positions of the various groups of nations composing the IGN framework can be summarized as follows: =The African Union= \\"While the group was pleased that the consensus decision would roll over the issue into the next session, the AU remained committed to a text-based reform process. In particular, the AU called attention to a letter circulated by the group on 21 July 2016, in response to the elements of convergence on working methods and the size of a reformed Council. As the AU pointed out, the ‚Äúelements‚Äù reflect only two out of five of the issues discussed in the IGN process. As such, it does not adequately reflect the record of the IGN in the 70th session, as there was substantial agreement and discussion of the other three issues which was not represented in the elements of convergence text. The AU called for a democratic, transparent, and accountable process, and for text-based negotiations to make the UN ‚Äòfit for purpose'.\\" =The G4 nations= Brazil, in its capacity as representative of the G4, called for the start of text- based negotiations to give the IGN substantive meaning. The G4 appreciated the elements of conversion text, which served to identify trends and move towards consensus, even if the text does not reflect all G4 positions. However, the Group was disappointed that there was not convergence on the other three issues. The G4 noted that they had hoped to begin concrete negotiations during the 70th session, arguing that the longer Security Council reform is postponed, the greater the discredit to the UN. The status quo is no longer an option, and there is a recognized need for a strong multilateral system. Brazil cited the major agreements reached over the last years‚Äîthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement, among others, but noted that the realm of peace and security is noticeably lacking in progress and reform. Brazil concluded its statement with a reminder of the need for a ‚ÄòUN fit for purpose on peace and security, in a discrete timeframe.‚Äô =The Uniting for Consensus Group (UfC), also known as the \\"Coffee Club\\"= \\"Italy, speaking for the United for Consensus group (UfC)[,] . . . applauded the technical rollover, which paved the way for continued discussion aiming for a broad consensus. It noted that the IGN is a member-driven process, that all sessions and meetings have been important for movement towards consensus, and that the points of convergence submitted by the facilitator reflect UfC‚Äôs understanding of the areas of convergence. UfC further called for flexibility and compromise on the remaining issues, in order to lead to a broad consensus decision in the future.\\" =The L.69 Group of Developing Countries= \\"Nicaragua . . ., representing the L69 group of developing countries[, said they were] . . . pleased that the framework and annexes, submitted in 2015, would remain central to the IGN‚Äôs work moving forward. The L69 argued that text-based negotiations would be vital, and should be conducted on the basis of the framework text, especially on the other three key issues for reform. In closing, the group hoped that the 71st session would lead to more concrete progress.\\" =The Arab League= \\"Kuwait, representing the Arab States, reaffirmed the desire for a broad decision and for continuing IGN debates in the 71st session. The group hoped for consensus, in order to lead to true and comprehensive reform.\\" =The Caribbean Community (CARICOM)= \\"Guyana, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), welcomed the rollover, and called for further work and reflection on Member State proposals when considering the achievements of the IGN in the 70th session, as well as the framework and annexes. CARICOM called the progress made important, though limited, and hoped that the text and elements of convergence would be a foundation for reform work in the 71st session.\\" =Russia and China (UNSC Permanent Members)= \\"China welcomed the rollover, and called for the next session to uphold the leadership of the UN and Member States, and reflect all the views of participants. Russia welcomed the rollover as well, noting that consensus adoption was good, but that there was far from universal agreement in the negotiations. Russia asked that reforms be adopted with more than a two-thirds majority, though ideally through consensus, and ended with a call for a transparent and inclusive process without artificially imposed timelines.\\" References External Links Working Groups of the United Nations General Assembly Category:United Nations Security Council ","title":"Intergovernmental Negotiations framework"},{"id":"54888112","text":"The Neihu Refuse Incineration Plant () is an incinerator in Neihu District, Taipei, Taiwan.http://www.industryabout.com/country- territories-3/2249-taiwan/waste-to-energy/35158-taipei-neihu-incineration- plant History The construction of the plant was completed in January 1992, led by Takuma Co.

Attitudes can be influential on many processes such as being utilitarian (useful), social, relating to values, or a reduction of cognitive dissonance. They can be beneficial and help people interact with the world. In the late 1950s when psychoanalysis and behaviorism reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and Katz (1960) separately and independently developed typologies of human attitudes in relation to the functions to which they believed the attitudes served. This theory proposes that attitudes are held by individuals because they are important and integral to psychological functioning. The function of an attitude is more important than whether the attitude is accurate or correct.  Background  Aristotle's Rhetoric, renowned for its modes of persuasion in ethos, logos, and pathos, gave mankind its first recorded guide to and theory of social influence. Aristotle recognized that different appeals are necessary for different types of persuasion, and that these appeals can be tailored and refined to better suit the audience or better suit the product or idea at hand. In the late 1950s when psychoanalysis and behaviorism reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and Katz (1960) separately and independently developed typologies of human attitudes in relation to the functions to which they believed the attitudes served. The goal of these ‚Äòfunctional attitude theories,‚Äô (FAT) as they would come to be known, was to understand the effect of functional attitudinal states in relation cognition and behavior, and specifically, for Katz (1960),> to increase the efficacy of persuasive communications by matching approaches or appeals to the function that the attitude served. Smith et al. (1956) concentrated on the links between attitudinal states and personality and interviewed ten men regarding their attitude toward the Soviet Union (Carpenter et al., 2013). This logically inductive study was too small to make any binding conclusions, and the study's non-empirical nature meant that it would be dubious as a base for future research, but Smith and colleagues‚Äô foundational theories would go on to inspire and guide future FAT research. Likewise, Katz's (1960) deductive findings did more to explain and define the general concepts of FAT than it did in guiding the methods of future research. In fact, the lack of earlier research on FAT has been linked to both studies‚Äô failure to provide reproducible and falsifiable methods for future research on the theory (Harris & Toledo, 1997; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Despite this lack of methodology, both studies contributed to the basic concepts of FAT as it came of age in the 1980s and on.  Concepts  Within FAT, attitudes are considered qualitative variables in relation to the function that they serve. That is, attitudes are the independent variable of a set function (utilitarian, social-adjustive, etc.), which influence both cognition and behavior (dependent variables). Researchers posited that people develop attitudes to serve their goals, and that although any particular attitude might serve multiple functions, it would generally serve one more than the others (Katz, 1960; Smith, Bruner, & White, 1956 ). They theorized that although two people might have an attitude with exactly the same valence, that attitude might serve very different functions for each person. While different attitudes serve different psychological functions, it is imperative to note that they are not mutually exclusive of one another as similar attitudes may be developed for different reasons by different people; it is the aim of FAT to understand why these attitudes develop to better understand how to influence them (Harris & Toledo, 1997). Though different terminology was employed, both Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) conceptualized similar attitude functions: utilitarian, social-adjustive, value-expressive, ego- defensive, and knowledge. These five traditional functional attitudes are defined briefly below, followed by a synthesis of recent \\"neofunctional\\" FAT studies, and a brief critique of FAT. Utilitarian attitudes Many attitudes serve a utilitarian function by serving to amplify rewards and minimize the punishments attained from objects in the environment (Katz 1960, Smith et al., 1956). The models of utilitarian attitudes are consequentialist theories: that which creates right acts is their consequences (Miller, 1990). It refers to theories of right action whereas the right act to choose in any situation is the one that will achieve the highest balance of pleasure over pain for all affected beings. When no act is available to which will produce net pleasure, the act which is right will produce the least net pain. As an example, one's attitude toward ice cream may serve a utilitarian function because it is likely to be based on the reward (e.g., enjoyable taste) and punishments (e.g., weight gain) associated with ice cream and to guide behavior that maxims benefits while minimizing costs (e.g., eating low-fat ice cream) (Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Based in human beings' need to discriminate between objects that produce pleasure and increase task efficiency and those that produce pain and decrease task efficiency, utilitarian functions aid in increasing utility (Carpenter et al., 2013). An individual with a utilitarian attitude is concerned with how an object will assist in improving their quality of life. In terms of products, any T-shirt could be considered utilitarian in terms of its ability to provide comfort and some shelter for an individual. Social-adjustive attitudes Social-adjustive functions are those which regulate relationships and enable individuals to climb the social ladder through outward displays of status which are theorized to make the individual more attractive or popular in the eyes of valued groups. An individual with a social-adjustive attitude is concerned with status, popularity, and how they are viewed by others and will seek objects that assist in developing their desired social image (Carpenter et al., 2013). An example of a product with social-adjustive function would be a designer T-shirt, such as one with an embroidered horse or a couture-brand logo that communicates its worth to viewers. Attitudes serving a social-adjustive function promote the capability to connect with appropriate social group members or to impress attractive others. Snyder and DeBono (1985) have suggested that attitudes may often serve contrasting functions for people who differ in self-monitoring. High self-monitoring individuals typically attempt to tailor their behavior to the social/interpersonal requirement of the situations they encounter, to fit in with others, thus implying that they may often hold attitudes that serve a social-adjustive function. In a series of studies assessing participants' responses to advertisements, Snyder and DeBono (1985) found that high self- monitoring individuals were influenced more by image-oriented \\"soft-sell\\" ads that implied a product's utility at helping its users to fit in with others (i.e., social-adjustive concerns), whereas low self-monitoring individuals were much more responsive to \\"hard-sell\\" ads that focused on the intrinsic quality and value of the products (said to reflect value-expressive concerns) (Bazzini & Shaffer 1995). Advertising studies have shown that participants form more favorable attitudes toward a variety of consumer goods when the ads highlight functionally relevant rather than functionally irrelevant concerns (Shavitt, 1989; Snyder & DeBono, 1985). Persuasive appeals are most effective at influencing attitudes when they in some way address the underlying motives that such attitudes serve (DeBono & Harnish, 1988). Value-expressive attitudes Perhaps the most difficult to conceptualize and affect, value-expressive functions assist in the outward expression of innate values. Some attitudes are meaningful to a person because they articulate beliefs that are intrinsic to that person's self-concept (i.e. their ideas about who they are). The attitude is, consequently, \\"part of who they are\\" and the expression of that attitude communicates important things about that person to others (Carpenter et al., 2013). Hullett (2002) used value-relevance as an indication of the perceived utility of an attitude to achieve a desired end-state. It is a direct measure of the relationship between a value and an attitude, rather than a measure of the expression of attitudes that are linked to personal values. Concentrating on value-expressive communication of an attitude rather than value-relevance allows communication behavior to take center stage in considering the relationship between values, attitudes, and behaviors (Carpenter et al., 2013). Value-expressive attitudes serve no direct outward purpose, and can be best understood as existing to satisfy an individual's need to feel unique and true-to-self. Individuals with value-expressive attitudes are not concerned with much other than being true to themselves (Carpenter et al., 2013). Product-wise, a concert T-shirt that was passed down from father to son due to their shared value of the musical stylings of that artist would be value-expressive in that the son feels the T-shirt, no matter how dingy, is an extension of his true self. Ego-defensive attitudes Ego- defensive functions serve to protect the individual from both internal and external unpleasantness. Ego-defensive attitudes allow people to avoid accepting unpalatable or objectionable aspects of self or of the external world. Ego-defensive attitudes can advocate conserving one's own self-esteem. An ego-defensive function, in which one's attitude is held to protect oneself from threatening or undesirable truths (Bazzini & Shaffer 1995). Threats to self-esteem can include personal failings or poor behavior. Katz (1960) and Shavitt and Nelson (2002) posit that ego-defensive attitudes aid in self- esteem maintenance through multiple processes. Cialdini et al. (1976)https://www.academia.edu/570635/Basking_in_reflected_glory_Three_football_field_studies propose that a product serving an ego-defensive function would be a T-shirt with the logo of a championship-winning sports team to boost one's own ego through what they term \\"basking in reflected glory\\". That is, the recognition of a sports team's greatness serves to boost one's own self-esteem through general association. Knowledge attitudes The fifth function, that of knowledge, aids individuals in comprehending the world around them. Individuals with a knowledge attitude seek to understand occurrences out of the desire to know, not because it is immediately relevant to their needs, but because they simply want to understand (Carpenter et al., 2013). Attitudes that serve a knowledge function help people gain greater understanding of the structure and operation of their world (Katz, 1960). The world that people inhabit is extremely complex, and that attitudes might facilitate making sense of that world without serving needs other than understanding. Other scholars propose that the knowledge function drives attitudes that serve for no purpose other than learning about the world as an end in itself, predicated on a basic need to know (Locander & Spivey, 1978).  Contemporary research  In 1986 Gregory Herek posited that all attitudes should be perceived as serving either an evaluative or an expressive function, with all attitudes serving one of these functions to some extent. This \\"neofunctional\\" reconceptualization allows for attitudes to then serve multiple functions, which thus allows researchers to measure how much influence each attitude has on function (Carpenter et al., 2013). Herek (1986) also posited that some personality characteristics may be linked to attitudes serving a specific function. This suggestion has proven to be valid in a multitude of studies that take self- monitoring into account as a predictable personality type in relation to attitude functions (Snyder & DeBono, 1985; Shavitt, 1990; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Herek's (1986) neofunctional theory resulted in a boom of development of social influence research relating to FAT. Most of this research has centered around the \\"matching hypothesis\\" that stems from the original Katz (1960) study, as it manipulates individuals' attitudes to determine whether matching product advertising appeals to attitude functions regarding the product. Most this research has shown that matching functional attitudes to messaging regarding the function of a product results in increased persuasive salience (Shavitt, 1990; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Other studies have gone even further in attempting to measure the cognitive processes that underlie individual functional attitudes especially in relation to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (DeBono & Harnish, 1988; Petty & Wegener, 1998), albeit to mixed results showing positive ELM-based processing for high self-monitors, but negative suasory effects in subjects deemed to be low self-monitoring.  Herek's neofunctional approach  After Katz (1960) and Smith's (1956) seminal studies, the functional approach to attitudes was effectively abandoned. Citing the lack of empirical methodological tests to quantify attitude functions as the main reason for the detriment of functional attitude theory, in 1986 Gregory Herek set out to create a new approach to functional attitude theory (Herek, 1986). Recognizing the validity of both the reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975, 1980) and the symbolic approaches (Kinder & Sears, 1981) to attitudes, Herek proposed that both approaches may be equally appropriate to employ depending on certain person characteristics, attitude domains, or situations (Herek, 1986, 1987). Herek posited that attitudes serve two general purposes: they are either evaluative or expressive. Within evaluative attitudes, Herek proposed three evaluative functions: experiential and specific, experiential and schematic, or anticipatory-evaluative. Likewise, expressive attitudes served three separate functions: social- expressive, value-expressive, or defensive. Herek's Neofunctional Approach to Attitudes, then, proposed that these different attitudes regarding the same attitude object may form for different purposes in different situations or domains, and, likewise, individuals may hold the same attitudes toward the object, but for a variety of different functions. By allowing for multiple attitudes to be held for different functions, Herek created a quantitative scale that allows for empirical comparison of multiple attitudes regarding the same object (Carpenter, 2013). Development Herek claimed that functionalism was attractive as an approach to attitude theory because it felt like \\"common sense\\" to most people and possessed the potential to integrate other attitude theories such as Ajzen & Fishbein's (1980) theory of reasoned action, or Sears et al.'s (1980) symbolic politics (Herek, 1987), but because Smith (1956) and Katz (1960) failed to create accurate and consistent methodologies in their seminal studies, functionalism was never able to get off the ground and develop a comprehensive theory able to predict conditions under which specific attitude functions would dominate (Herek, 1987). To create an empirical functional theory, Herek first developed two different methodologies to quantify and group different functions of attitudes. Method One: Content Analysis Herek set out to determine what functions attitudes mainly served by conducting content analyses of undergraduate student essays describing their feelings about lesbian women and gay men (Herek, 1987). Herek chose the topic because of his belief that it was a controversial enough issue at the time to elicit extreme attitudes both in terms of acceptance and rejection of gay people. Because of the nature of the issue, it was also expected that attitudes reported regarding gays would be deeply-held and would serve a wide range of functions. Subjects were instructed to begin their essay with \\"I have generally positive [or negative] attitudes toward lesbians and male homosexuals because‚Ä¶\\" (Herek, p. 287). Herek and two assistants then categorized the essays by themes, defined as, \\"any idea or complete thought somehow related to the respondent's attitudes.\\" The researchers found twenty- eight recurring themes which they then coded every essay for, parsing categories as necessary. After the preliminary study, which evaluated 110 essays, a new sample of 248 students from the same university wrote attitude essays on the same topic of gays and lesbians. The new sample also completed questionnaires that collected demographic data and were also used to select students who reported exclusively heterosexual behaviors. A total of 205 of this new sample qualified for coding based on the presence or absence of the 28 themes previously found. Using block cluster analysis, the researchers identified patterns of multiple themes within essays, which were interpreted to indicate the presence of function(s). Block cluster analysis resulted in five interpretable clusters of themes which were then refined per the theoretical perspectives of Smith et al. (1956) and Katz (1960). This refinement resulted in two patterns of themes containing positive attitudes (experiential-schematic: positive, self-expressive: positive), and three patterns containing negative attitudes (experiential-schematic: negative, self-expressive: negative, and defensive). Method Two: Attitude Functions Inventory Recognizing that content analysis can be a time-consuming procedure, Herek also developed an objective inventory for attitude functions based on the sentence \\"My opinions about [target] mainly are based on‚Ä¶\\" with different completions for the sentence based on the four functions: experiential- schematic, defensive, value-expressive, and social-expressive (Herek, 1987). Sixty-nine subjects completed four variations of the AFI, the first of which was a follow-up to the original content analysis assessing the attitudes toward lesbians and gays, and the other three examining attitudes toward persons with AIDS, cancer, or mental illness, respectively. Using a Likert scale, respondents rated AFI statements on a scale ranging from 'not at all,' 'true of me,' or 'very true of me.' Additionally, respondents completed three attitude-related personality measures: the Defense Mechanisms Inventory, the Self-Consciousness Scale, and the Self-Monitoring Scale. Using the results of the personality tests, Herek successfully predicted where certain personalities would fall on the AFI, with all personalities falling somewhere on the scale.  Neofunctional attitude functions  Evaluative functions The source benefit of evaluative functions is associated with rewards and punishments from the attitude object itself. This means that when a functionally evaluative attitude is held, attitude objects are treated as ends in themselves as individuals perceive their association between either reward or punishment. Positive attitudes will arise toward an object when the individual perceives it as a source of utility or pleasure while negative attitudes are a result of direct past, or anticipated future, unpleasant experiences with the object. In line with the original posits of both Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956), neofunctional evaluative attitudes allow people to organize their reality according to both self-interest and predictability. Herek specified three individual evaluative functions: Experiential-specific * * Attitudes that are experiential and specific arise after interacting with a particular instance of the object category wherein a specific attitude object, rather than a category of objects, is evaluated in terms of its individual utility. For example, an individual who had a positive experience when riding in their friend's car might develop an experiential- specific attitude toward that brand and model of car, but their attitude would not be applicable across the general category of all cars or even of the category of that brand of cars. * Experiential-schematic * * Attitudes that are experiential and schematic arise after interacting with a particular instance of the attitude object category, and experiences become representative of the object category as a whole. The individual's past experiences with representatives of that object category led to cognitive schema that serve to set attitudes for all objects within the category. Here, an individual who had a good experience riding in their friend's car might develop an experiential-schematic attitude toward all cars made by the same brand as their friend's car. * Anticipatory-evaluative * * While experiential- specific and schematic attitude functions are based on deductive prior experiences, individuals with an anticipatory-evaluative attitude must be inductive in their prediction of the utility of attitude objects. Anticipatory-evaluative attitudes can be based on whatever object qualities an individual chooses to use. For instance, if an individual hates red and their friend offers to take them for a ride in their red car, the individual might take on a negative anticipatory-evaluative attitude that predicts that they will not enjoy the car ride. * Expressive functions Within expressive functions of attitude, the attitude object is a means to an end. Attitude objects of expressive attitudes are used as vehicles to assure social status, boost self-esteem, and/or reduce anxiety. While expressive functions serve some sense of utility, the effects are not as apparent, and are often intrinsic rewards rather than the extrinsic utility seen with evaluative functions. Social-expressive * * Social-expressive attitudes serve the function of social-maintenance or acceptance, and are based on the needs of an individual to be accepted by others. Snyder and DeBono's (1985) self- monitoring study is useful in determining the likelihood of an individual to hold a social-expressive attitude. High self-monitors should be more likely to hold social-expressive attitudes as they are theoretically more in-tune with their social surroundings, thus leading to a higher need for this function in order to maintain or elevate their status. * Value-expressive * * Value- expressive attitudes are based in an individual's needs to define themselves through expressing core values and aligning themselves with value groups (such as political parties, churches, organizations, etc.). Low self-monitors should theoretically be more prone to value-expressive attitudes as they are more concerned with their individual principles than they are with social status, however value-expressive attitudes can be found in all personality types, especially when it comes to contentious issues such as abortion. * Defensive * * Defensive attitudes serve to reduce turmoil caused by internal, typically unconscious, conflicts. Defensive attitudes can be understood in terms cognitive dissonance theory as a means to achieve consonance when dealing with internal (or external) dissonance. An individual would develop a defensive attitude, then, when presented with an idea that is contrary to their internal values or beliefs. * Sources of attitude functions Herek believed one of the downfalls of Katz and Smith et al. (1956) was their direct comparison of personality traits, which are relatively stable, to attitude functions, which studies show to fluctuate from person-to-person or situation-to-situation (Herek, 1986). Recognizing that individuals‚Äô psychological predispositions to functions varied, and that individuals often expressed the same attitude for different reasons or attitudes about separate objects for the same reason, Herek proposed three sources of attitude functions that attitudes could vary across. These sources can aid in the prediction and influence of behavior when it can be determined from which source an individual will root their attitude. Person characteristics Herek defines person characteristics as \\"relatively stable psychological needs, values, and orientations toward the world\\" (Herek, 1986). Through the content analysis and AFI, Herek found that individuals with experiential-schematic attitudes scored higher on the self-monitoring test, theorizing that experiential-schematic intergroup individuals are more sensitive to their surroundings as well as their own values. Herek also showed that persons who operate mainly on evaluative functions show strong concerns for their own well-being. Alternatively, social-expressive attitudes were found most amongst individuals who exhibited a high need for affiliation as well high self-presentation awareness (Snyder & DeBono, 1985). Ultimately, personality is a weak means for social influence as personality is typically stable across individuals. Domain characteristics Herek defined domain characteristics as \\"groups, objects, issues, or behaviors toward which people hold attitudes\\" (1986). Individual domains can include a multitude of different attitudes. For instance, in Herek's methodology development attitudes were examined within the domain of attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Within this domain is contained attitudes toward people with AIDS, attitudes toward government-funding of anti-AIDS programming, attitudes toward AIDS fundraisers, etc. Broad domains like AIDS or politics likely contain all variations of attitude functions across a population, but more narrow domains, such as consumer products, are less likely to elicit an array of attitudes as individuals tend to view this type of domain from an evaluative perspective. Situational characteristics Situations are defined by Herek as \\"relatively transient social episodes\\", and include the setting, actors, and context of the episode. In situations where an individual recognizes specific personal goals, evaluative attitudes are more likely to develop. Past experiences with attitude objects, as necessary in experiential-specific and schematic attitudes, will stimulate memories of past situations involving the attitude object, which will then determine the valence of attitude held by the individual. Alternatively, in situations that highlight identity needs, such as a political debate, individuals are more likely to employ an expressive attitude.  Critique  While FAT has proven extremely valuable in predicting increased influence through functional matching through an array of empirical studies, explanations for why this effect is present have yet to materialize. Lavine and Snyder (1996) posited that the matching effect could be attributed to biased processing of messages that are functionally linked, with individuals processing functionally-matched messages peripherally (ELM) or heuristically (HSM). However, research based on the ELM has provided mixed results and many studies have failed in their attempts to replicate original results and thus theories other than ELM are necessary to understand the function matching phenomenon (Carpenter et al., 2013). Additionally, FAT as a field of research is very messy in its theoretical models of application insofar as studies have not relied on one concrete definition of functional attitudes. From the theory's beginnings, Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) conceptualized similar-yet-different functions, Herek's (1986) neofunctional theory further parsed these functions, and later research by Snyder and DeBono (1985) added the personality variables of high v. low self-monitors into FAT. This is not to say that any of their research was invalidated by these additions or differences, but only to note that the theory could benefit from a set of unitary applicable definitions and functions.  Benefits and practical applications  FAT is best understood as a foundational approach to social influence upon which other models or processes may be applied. It is incredibly useful in that it can be easily understood and applied to real-life situations, allowing social influencers to predict the persuasive appeal that would best match their audience's functional attitude toward a product or idea. Ample lab research has categorically proven that matching attitude functions to appeals improves the salience of persuasive arguments, especially regarding advertisements (Shavitt & Nelson, 2002; Carpenter et al., 2013). This matching effect can also be exploited in interpersonal social influence situations and professions such as courtroom arguments or governmental lobbying.  Anecdotal application  Generally, democratic governmental systems are understood to operate in a utilitarian fashion in that the most preferred candidate is elected by the masses, and is then expected to act on legislation in a manner that induces maximum benefit to their constituents. While it is mainly true that politicians act to increase utility for their constituents, there is also an individual attitudinal side to every politician that, according to FAT, can be understood to serve any of a variety of functions, and can thus be manipulated and matched to arguments in support of or against certain bills. That is, if a lobbyist can understand the attitude functions of legislation in regard to a particular politician, then that lobbyist can also predict which attitude function to match to their persuasive appeal.  Future applications  Perhaps the most economically promising theoretical application of FAT lies in the future of online ad targeting. Lab research on personality regarding attitude functions has had to rely on self- reporting or surveys to determine high v. low self-monitoring or expressive v. evaluative personality types. As technology improves, the ability to determine personality types and attitude functions, as well as the consumer behaviors associated with these factors, may soon become algorithmic. Meta-analyses of IP datamining such as search history and browsing habits, combined with knowledge of consumer behavior obtained through records that pre-date the internet could lead to electronic profiles of individual consumers to be used by advertisers to hyper-target their audience with ultra-tailored or matched ads.  Summary  Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) originally set out to discover the purpose of varying attitudes, determining that attitudes exist to serve a variety of functions necessary to individuals‚Äô physical, emotional, and social needs. Their functional attitudes theory sparked a wave of research in the 1980s that was able to consistently empirically link function-matched appeals and arguments to increased persuasion when presented to individuals perceived to be in that attitude function. This matching hypothesis has been replicated, but studies attempting to prove the link behind it have not. While future research is needed to determine the cause of the matching effect, as well as to develop consistent attitude and personality measurements, FAT is a practically applicable theory that allows social influencers to accurately predict what type of functional appeal should be used when persuading an audience about a product or idea.

He was previously incarcerated as a prisoner of war for 897 days, inside both Uganda and Tanzania. He was a presidential advisor on Buganda Kingdom affairs. He was well respected for his fight towards environmental protection. Background and education He was born in 1952, in Katakala, Mityana District, to a father who was a hunter and farmer. Kasirye Ggwanga learned both skills and was good at both. He attended Katakala Primary School, Namukozi then he studied at Kibuli Secondary School for his O-Level education. After finishing Senior 4, he joined the Uganda Army in 1972. Career Following boot camp and initial training, he was posted to Arua in the West Nile sub-region, as a map reader, serving in that capacity until 1977. In 1978, he was promoted to the position of artillery officer and the following year, he was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant. In 1978, the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) invaded Uganda. In April they captured Kampala and deposed Idi Amin. Kasirye Ggwanga surrendered and was taken to Tanga, Tanzania, as prisoner of war number 17341. In June 1980, President Godfrey Binaisa negotiated the return of the political prisoners to Uganda. They were first housed at Maluku Prison in Mbale District. Later, they were moved to Kirinya Prison, Jinja District. On 7 October 1981, Kasirye Ggwanga was in the first batch to be released. Three months after Kasirye Ggwanga's release, the Uganda Freedom Army (UFA) rebels led by Andrew Kayiira attacked the army barracks at Mengo Lubiri in Kampala. The government in power at the time, led by Milton Obote of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) mistakenly thought that the recently released prisoners (former Idi Amin soldiers) were involved in the attack. Kasirye Ggwanga was placed on the \\"wanted list\\". He went underground. His elder brother, Lieutenant James Kasirye, a military pilot then based at Nakasongola Military Air Base was arrested and tortured, then killed when he refused to identify where his brother Kasirye Ggwanga was hiding. To avenge the killing of his brother, Kasirye Ggwanga joined the UFA rebels, then about 650 in number. This group operated in the Mawokota and Mubende areas in Buganda. In 1985, he left UFA and joined Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army, which seized power in January 1986. During the drive to capture Kampala, Kasirye Ggwanga commanded a 120mm artillery unit. Between 1986 and 2005, he served in several roles including as the LC5 chairman for Mubende District and as the director of stores in the UPDF. On 31 January 2005, he was retired from the UPDF at the rank of Brigadier. However, after three months on the outside he came back to the military and asked to be re-instated. The UPDF commander- in-chief allowed him to rejoin on a renewable contract of five years. In March 2018, Kasirye Ggwanga was promoted from the rank of Brigadier to that of Major General, in a promotions exercise involving 1,384 men and women of the UPDF. He was also officially retired from the Uganda military, in 2018. Personal Kasirye Ggwanga was a married father. He was a commercial farmer and owned two farms; one in Mubende District, and another in Mukono District that measures which he referred to as his Camp David.  Ggwanga's battles with the law.  Throughout his life, General Kasirye Ggwanga was much hailed rather than feared for his rather barbaric record. On several occasions, he used his gun to settle simple arguments, whipped, battered and intimidated people with his head high. According to the daily monitor, in August 2017, the now deceased General bragged about burning a grader he found on his daughter's land in Lubowa, a Kampala suburb. The case was soon forgotten since the police did not do much to investigate further. Asked about the incident, the General said ‚ÄúI burnt that tractor. Tell them. I am now hunting them. I am a bad hunter. Let them know‚Äù. According to Softpower news, in January 2019, Gen Kasirye Ggwanga swaggered into action against renowned musician and presidential advisor Catherine Kusasira. In his attempt to quell noise pollution, the trigger happy veteran shot Catherine's car tyres leaving it damaged and immobile. Yet again, the General who lived his post war years above the law moved away scot free. In fact, the musician had to apologize to him for almost shooting her over a noise report from his sons. Much is left to be reported about his cruelty or rather tough love lifestyle. Often, he was praised by the majority disregarding the victims. =See also= * Elly Kayanja * Ali Kiiza References External links * Images of Kasirye GGgwanga at Google.com Category:1952 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Mubende District Category:Ganda people Category:Ugandan military personnel Category:Prisoners of war Category:Ugandan prisoners of war Category:Ugandan generals Category:Ugandan environmentalists ","title":"Kasirye Ggwanga"},{"id":"54888538","text":"¬øQu√© pas√≥ con Jacqueline?

He was a Democrat who represented District 1 which at that time encompassed the northern parts of Monterey County. He served on various committees and published books on local history and genealogy. He was a native of Monterey County. Warren Church has been acknowledged as the father of the Monterey County parks system. Early life, education Warren Church was born in northern Monterey County and spent all his life in the county, graduating from King City High School in 1947. He was a high school athlete as well as being active with both student government and the school newspaper. At the age of 15, Church worked in the stock room of the King City J.C. Penney department store. He graduated from California Polytechnic State College in 1962, earning a bachelor's degree in social sciences and a Master of Arts Degree in education-social sciences. He also received both elementary and secondary teaching credentials. Church taught at the Pajaro Elementary and the Jefferson school in San Benito. In 1974 Church was awarded the Honored Alumni Award by Cal Poly University's alumni association. In college Church also served on the staff of the college newspaper, \\"El Mustang.\\" Warren Church is a veteran of the Korean War and served with the 987th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and was wounded while serving, receiving a Purple Heart. He was eventually discharged as a Corporal, April 17, 1953. Board of Supervisors Before the 1964 Monterey County Board of Supervisors primary, Church, Allmond and incumbent Chester Deaver were split over their positions on the incorporation of North Monterey County, Castroville and Moss Landing. Church opposed incorporation of North Monterey County, calling it an \\"'extremely poor, short sighted and senseless reason,'\\" but felt that Castroville was ready. Allmond called the incorporation of Castroville a \\"'stab in the back'\\" but later changed to asking for more input from the Castroville people. Deaver wanted to take a \\"'wait and see' attitude.\\" In the June 1964 primary, Chester Deaver had finished far in front of his challengers; Deaver 2,927, Church 1,374, Allmond 1,116, Simon 938, Bayer 650, Coffill 391 (unofficial results). However, the runoff of the top two candidates led to the election of Church to the Monterey County Board of Supervisors November 3, 1964. Church defeated incumbent Deaver, \\"with a 1,066 vote margin\\". At the time, The supervisor position was part-time and came with a typewriter and $300 a month for incidentals. The 1968 election results were Church 5,555 to Simon 2,859. In 1972, the Salinas Californian endorsed Church for Supervisor, while saying that they have disagreed with him many times and probably will continue to do so as \\"the interests of the city of Salinas seen to be a fairly low priority item with him... Nevertheless,... he is head and shoulders above his opponents.\\" Church won reelection for his third term June 6, 1972. He won with 53% of the vote. His challengers were Jack Simon and Andrew Hollenstain. Warren Church In 1972 Church was invited to a Salinas Board of Realtors meeting to discuss campaign issues in a private setting. Church declined stating, In November 1972, the Board heard arguments for relaxing zoning ordinances for mobile homes in North Monterey County. Arguments for relaxing were due to very high home prices that made owning a home in the county difficult. Arguments against were that mobile homeowners used the county services equally as a homeowner but paid lower taxes. There was also a concern about a reduction of lot sizes, allowing the county to double in population since 1963 when 11,000 residents lived in the unincorporated area of North County (excluding Castroville). According to the North County Rezoning Study which looked at 48,700 acres and an existing density of 11.3 acres per unit, proposed developments could increase the population from 16,000 (from 1970 census) to 338,900 with a density of .51 acres per unit. Appearance of mobile homes, fire safety, and environmental concerns were also a consideration. Church stated that all attendees at the meeting that approved of the ban lived in North Monterey County, and those arguing about the ban were people who lived outside the area and had a financial interest. One Pacific Grove resident, Art Woodfin, complained about the ban stating that he \\"had an option on 15 acres of land in North County and planned to put mobile homes on it.\\" Church replied, \\"'Then you're coming to rape the North County?'\\" The Salinas Californian stated in 1975 that although the Californian has criticized Church, \\"he's given us about as good as he's got in rebuttal... its hard not to admire the man's independence.\\" There was a serious recall effort for Church's seat in 1974 which failed. Despite losing several elections, \\"Defeat doesn't discourage him... Church doesn't scare worth a darn.\\" In August 1975, Church announced that he would not seek re- election to the Board of Supervisors saying, \\"'12 years is as long as anyone should consecutively hold any one elective or appointive position... New ideas are necessary for proper functioning of government.'\\" He hinted that he might run for the State Senate seat that was being vacated by Republican Donald Grunsky. Church had a perfect meeting attendance record. In the 12 years of Church's tenure, he did not miss a single board meeting. Church remembers at his farewell Supervisor meeting that he \\"attended 558 consecutive regular board meetings and 100 or more special meetings.\\" Reflecting on needs of the county for his successor, Church said that \\"growth and property taxes... the two major problems facing Monterey County... prohibit general use of the property tax and adopt low density zoning... we don't have to become South San Jose.\\" Further about his tenure with the Board, Church reflected, \\"I see no basis to bring suit against the county, except perhaps for the amount and color of my hair.\\" County Supervisor and future Congressman Sam Farr in 1976, said of his colleague Church, \\"'I think this board has really been one of the outstanding supervisorial boards in California ... whose 12 years of experience and insight have taught me a lot. I think that serving in public office is really a leveling experience. I think I've learned that from my colleague on the left (Poyner) and Mr. Church.'\\" =Parks= A plaque honoring Church for his efforts in starting the county park system and preserving the native environment and resources. Church was instrumental in the acquisition and development of the Monterey County Parks system. When running for the board position in 1964 his \\"main plank was a county park system.\\" Prior to 1966, Monterey County did not have a parks department, and was one of the last counties in California to have one. There had been interest in 1944 when the county made a parks plan, but nothing happened. Church blames a '\\"conservative viewpoint that didn't push for public services.'\\" for the reason it took until 1966 to give Monterey County its first public park, Royal Oaks Park. He spearheaded the purchase of a former turkey ranch, for Royal Oaks Park ($122,000 - it was $1,000 an acre), which opened on Labor Day in 1966 and also saw establishment of the Monterey County Parks Department that same year. His tenure on the Board of Supervisors also saw the creation of a number of other parks including Manzanita Park near Castroville, Toro Park in Salinas, Jacks Peak in Monterey and San Lorenzo Park near King City. At the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Monterey County Parks Department, Republican Charmaine Cruchett thanked Church and said, \\"The little fox I recently saw dashing across Castroville Boulevard into Manzanita Park may not know who provided that haven, but certainly all North Countians should. I thank you Warren. My children thank you. And if we're lucky, our human progeny can share your parks progeny forever.\\" The county administrative office released a memorandum October 2, 2006 at the 40th anniversary of the Parks Department saying, \\"The highlight of the event was the attendance of Warren Church... who was instrumental in establishing the Parks Department and Charter Park Commissioners, from 1966.\\" In 1977 Church said he had tried to protect =Civic interests= In 1975 Church pointed out that there is a relationship between growth and property taxes leading to agricultural land being sold for development. This drives the need for services and thus higher taxes. One outcome was passage in 1976 of a Board of Supervisors resolution to establish \\"growth guidelines to protect the character of the county.\\" Church felt that rather than using property taxes to support county governments, a percentage of federal or state income tax could be set aside. Church was a strong supporter of local control and access to the court system and he long resisted the eventual consolidation of Monterey County courts, largely in service to the interests of his constituents. At the end of his tenure, the Californian stated that Church was a strong supporter of the library system and initiated the first family planning program in Monterey County. Church was also a founder of Post 593 of the Prunedale American Legion. =Humble Oil= Church was a key vote on a controversial 1965 project promoted by Humble Oil, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, that would have changed the Monterey Bay's look and feel. Humble was intended to kickstart a massive 60-square-mile development plan for the Moss Landing area that would have significally impacted the area's natural beauty and altered it's economic development. The company wanted to build a 50,000-barrel-a-day refinery with plans to expand to 150,000-200,000 barrels-a-day on a 444 acre site on the wetlands near Moss Landing at the Elkhorn Slough. Monterey County was deeply divided on the plan with tourism proponents, some agricultural interests and a nascent environmental movement opposing the refinery. However, public opinion surveys showed greater than 2 to 1 support for the Humble Oil refinery with Church's supervisorial district in favor with 82%. The Board of Supervisors, after a 17-hour marathon public meeting, voted 3-2 to back the plan, with Church in favor of it because his district overwhelmingly backed the plan. But Church and others added many tough restrictions to the project a few weeks later at a 12-hour meeting that set the conditions for the permit. \\"It is not just the Humble Oil refinery we are fighting at Moss Landing,\\" said Carmel Highlands photographer Ansel Adams prior to the decision. \\"It is the whole industrial complex which will inevitability follow and change the whole complexion of this Monterey County.\\" The Humble project was approved, but the planning commission (which had previously rejected the project by a 5-4 vote) had imposed 36 conditions many that had never been imposed on an industry before. Church added three more which included for parking, sulfur recovery and carbon monoxide emissions. As a part of the imposed conditions on the approval for Humble Oil, Church asked that three air-pollution stations be set up in Monterey County to monitor air quality for two-years prior to Humble starting to build. Church said that the county needed to do so in order to \\"obtain 'guidelines' to determine what pollutants an oil refinery may contribute.\\" Church's intentions were that Humble be required to pay for and maintain the stations. The Salinas Californian stated, ‚ÄúIt is conceivable in the future that other areas debating the admittance of an oil refinery will look at Monterey County as an example of strict regulations. The conditions are that unique.‚Äù One of the most restrictive conditions forbid Humble Oil from expanding significantly without getting a new permit. By the spring of 1966, Humble Oil was expressing the need for a larger refinery than initially permitted. Church publicly declared that there was not a majority on the Board of Supervisors for a larger refinery. Although not identifying himself as the supervisor switching his position on Humble, it is widely accepted that it was Church who refused to back a larger refinery unless Humble could ‚Äúprove‚Äù that a smaller one would comply with the county‚Äôs restrictions. On May 18, 1966 Humble Oil announced a suspension of all activities at Moss Landing, publicly stating that a prime reason for abandoning the site was the difficulty of achieving a permit for a larger refinery. Public outcry and a legal challenge plus engineering problems also discouraged Humble Oil, and they eventually pulled out of Monterey County and decided to build a bigger refinery up north in more-welcoming Benicia. In 1979, Church would become a founding member of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, which eventually helped create the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, which would have been devastated by Humble Oil‚Äôs refinery and future industrial development. After Humble Oil‚Äôs departure, no major industry seriously proposed to build at Moss Landing. In 1992, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary was established. Committees Church served on several civic and government boards, including: *California Central Coast Regional Water Control Board *Vice President Monterey County Board of Education - Served April 16, 1963 to November 12, 1964 *Monterey-Santa Cruz County Unified Air Pollution Control District - District Board of Directors from 1968 to 1975. *San Felipe Committee (California Central Coast Water Importation) *Special Tax Committees of the County Supervisors Association of California *Local Applications Advisory Board, created in 1965 to \\"approve applications for migrant housing, education and health care\\". Church was succeeded by John Ventura, Fresno County Supervisor in 1967. Warren Church - 1980 Personal life Church had a number of business ventures, including beekeeping in high school and college, nursery supply and Christmas Tree farms. He has grown Christmas trees in properties in Hidden Valley, at Omo Ranch, CA., Egremont, Ma., and Wadena, Mn. Death Church died September 2, 2017 at age 87. Suffering from a fatal disease and surrounded by close friends and family, he proactively took his own life using Seconal in accordance with the 2016 California End of Life Option Act.Wu, Amy \\"Former Monterey County supervisor Warren Church dies using 'end of life option'\\", \\"The Californian\\", September 7, 2017 The Californian September 2, 2017 article, quotes Church's son Glenn Church on the manner of his father's death, \\"He had no hesitation. He took the (fatal) prescription with conviction and certainty.\\" Church's cause of death was recorded as cachexia (the syndrome he had) in accordance of the End of Life Option Act.

The path, which is about one kilometer in length and lined with 24,000 plants, is similar to New York City's High Line. Skygarden was designed by MVRDV, a Dutch firm, and opened in May 2017. In the future, the park may become an urban nursery, growing trees and plants for replanting elsewhere in the city. The path also improves walking times around the city's Central Station. The disused overpass closed in 2015 and cuts diagonally across Seoul Station at 17m above street level. The '70' in the name comes from the year 1970 when the flyover was dedicated, while the '17' is both the number of walkways connected to it, and the year 2017. The park includes gardens, terraces, and exhibitions, and will \\"feature over 24,085 plants representing 228 species of trees, shrubs and flowers found in and outside Korea.\\"  History  In the 1960s, a decade after the Korean War, Seoul planners \\"ordered the construction of dozens of elevated highways to keep traffic flowing through the capital.

Seoul mayor Park Won Soon pushed for the US$52 million skypark to be completed as a complement to Seoul's Cheonggyecheon river restoration project, organized under previous mayor Lee Myung Bak. The park's plans faced early controversy over fears of traffic congestion and concerns from market owners in nearby Namdaemun.

The attack left 42 soldiers dead while 20 others were wounded. Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility of the attack.  Background  On 30 October 2006, missiles were launched on a madrassa in Chenagai village of Bajour Agency at around 05:00 am in which 82 people were killed. The motive of the airstrike was to kill Osama bin laden. The airstrike was carried out by Central Intelligence Agency and Pak army jointly.  Bombing  At around 08:40 (UTC + 05:00), when 130 recruits of Punjab Regiment were preparing for parade, a short bearded suicide bomber wearing cloak shouted \\"Allah hu Akbar\\" (God is Great) and blew himself up killing 38 and wounding 22 people at the spot, out of whom, 2 died later rosing the death toll to 40. Another suicide bomber failed to explode and was hunted as he tried to escape.  Aftermath  Security forces reached the site and cordoned off the area. Experts from KPK were summoned to Dargai for investigation.  Attribution and Responsibility  Initially the security forces blamed the banned militant organization, Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e- Mohammadi for the attack. Later on, an unidentified caller told a local journalist that Pakistani Taliban had carried out the attack to avenge the attack on a seminary at Bajaur.The caller was referring to the air strike the Pakistan Army said it had carried out on Oct 30 on the Bajaur seminary that it believed was being used to train militants. The strike had killed 82 people. The caller said the suicide bombing had been carried out by a group led by a hitherto unknown figure Abu Kalim Muhammad Ansari and claimed that it had another 274 volunteers to sacrifice their lives.  Reactions  Interior Minister of Pakistan Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao condemned the attack saying, \\"I very strongly condemn the reprehensible and cowardly act of terrorism against the innocent recruits undergoing training at the Punjab Regimental Training Centre in Dargai\\". Amir Muqam, in a statement, expressed deep sorrow. \\"Terrorists are neither friends of Islam nor well-wishers of Pakistan,\\" he maintained. CM KPK Akram Khan Durrani said \\"it is an act of naked aggression which has shaken the conscience of the humanity\\". Qazi Hussain Ahmed of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal said he was saddened by the deaths, but criticised the government for fomenting the bloodshed. \\"The government is to be blamed for today‚Äôs attack. If you kill innocent students and teachers by attacking their school, you should be ready to face such things,\\" he said. President of Awami National Party Asfandyar Wali Khan also expressed deep shock and condoled with the bereaved families. Maulana Samiul Haq expressed his profound grief and shock. Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Muhammad Jan Orakzai strongly condemned the suicide attack, describing it a \\"heinous act of cowardice\\". MNA Haroon-ur-Rashid said the people of Bajaur lodged a peaceful protest on every occasion against the killing of innocent students of the seminary. The attack caused Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla to cancel a planned trip to Peshawar. US government officials condemned the attack and praised Pakistan's role in the War on Terror.

The chapel dates from 1770-72. Restored in the Victorian era and again in 1956-58, its interior is a remarkably complete survival with an earthen floor and simple box pews. Now in the care of a trust, the chapel is a Grade I listed building. History Nonconformist preaching began in this part of Caernarvonshire in the 1740s.

According to Pinho (2004), virtual reality is characterized by immersion in the 3D world, interaction with virtual objects, and involvement in exploring the virtual environment.Piovesan, S. D., Passerino, L. M., & Pereira, A. S. (2012). VIRTUAL REALITY AS A TOOL IN THE EDUCATION. IADIS International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age. Retrieved from http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED542830.pdf The feasibility of the virtual reality in education has been debated due to several obstacles such as affordability of VR software and hardware. The psychological effects of virtual reality are also a negative consideration. However, recent technological progress has made VR more viable and promise new learning models and styles for students. These facets of virtual reality have found applications within the primary education (K-8th grade) sphere in enhancing student learning, increasing engagement, and creating new opportunities for addressing learning preferences.  General education  Virtual reality (VR) can be used in numerous ways in an educational setting. Seeing virtual reality as a continued improvement from PC-based simulation systems, researchers recognize its potential to provide special learning experiences which traditional education methods cannot. Although studies agree that restrictions still exist for classroom applications of virtual reality systems, researchers have been experimenting with using VR as part of the teaching method in many aspects of the general education. Following are example attempts at applying virtual reality in classrooms. = Augmented Reality = Augmented reality (AR) is a technology which superimposes virtual generated images on the real world. The coexistence of virtual objects and real environments have encourage experimentation and developments in educational which are not possible in the real world. A study done by Antonietti et al. (2000) found that giving children an in-depth virtual tour of a painting and letting them examine all aspects of the painting helped with their description and interpretation of the painting, when compared to a control group that studied the painting without the usage of VR. Another experiment was carried out on 91 sixth-grade primary students where they used an augmented reality application \\"WallaMe\\" which taught a didactic unit in art education. After analyzing the results, the study found a statistically significant improvements in academic performance, motivation, analysis of information, and collaboration. Augmented reality has also had developments into more mainstream academic settings. 3D rendition of textbooks provide students with a more synergetic way of learning. The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology has launched a geology textbook which allows students to learn traditional information while virtually interacting with the different layers of the earth's core. Another benefit of augmented reality is capitalizing on different learning styles. While virtual reality provides a more immersive experience, augmented reality learning technologies favor on auditory learners. A study done on science information retention in college students showed AR to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through spacial presence. = Virtual field trips = In virtual field trips, students visit real-world places or educational simulations to experience different lessons. Google ExpeditionsGoogle Expeditions allows students to take a shared field trip using smartphone headset technology under the control of a teacher‚Äôs app. Nearpod's VR provides lesson plans in all core subjects for primary grades, and has been shown to increase student engagement in lessons. Virtual field trips can also enable primary school students in rural areas to engage in career exploration opportunities not typically available. Field trips experiences are linked to an increase in interest and motivations to pursue those careers. One program, zipTrips, was designed to simulate the benefits of a life science career exploration field trip for middle school students. By harnessing the power of virtual reality, zipTrips allowed students to engage in live 45 minute field trips with scientists and their work. Students are shown to have an enhanced perception of science and scientific careers. = Individualized learning = Although VR can be used cooperatively, learning has been shown to be especially effective when VR is utilized for independent learning. Merchant et al. (2014) found that ‚Äústudents performed [significantly] better when they worked individually rather than collaboratively when learning through [VR based collaborative learning environments]‚Äù. Some VR applications provide independent learning opportunities when combined with individual lesson plans. For example, students might fill out a worksheet in correspondence with a specific virtual reality simulation. = Virtual World = Virtual worlds, or three-dimensional immersive virtual worlds in full, is an interactive online environment where people use avatars as their representations. The environment can be designed in any context, and users control their avatars to accomplish tasks in virtual worlds. An academic review on past empirical research identified three main areas virtual worlds are used in school settings: (1) communication spaces, (2) simulation of space, and (3) experiential spaces. Communication spaces refers to the communication between users, possibly between teachers and students. Communication takes in both verbal and nonverbal forms, using applications of the chat function and avatar movements respectively. The second use of virtual worlds is simulation of space. Space is one of the most important elements in virtual worlds in terms of its scalability and authenticity with great feasibility of simulating any environment. In an educational initiative, the environment can be built in a school setting to resonate with students as if they are actually in school. The Nanyang Technological University in Singapore developed a virtual campus tour for its prospective students. The virtual campus displays general information but also familiarize students with the campus before physically being there. The third main feature of virtual worlds is its experiential spaces, which allow students to ‚Äúlearn by doing‚Äù instead of learning by reading or listening. With virtual worlds, students can directly act on the subject, ‚Äúobserve the outcomes of their actions‚Äù and further reflect on the observable outcomes. = Music education = Because of budget cuts and restrictions such as disabilities, music education in K-12 is facing challenges, with which researchers are looking at virtual reality technology for help. Virtual interfaces with interactive visualization and audio feedback are being experimented with to improve the experience of learning a musical instrument for students. Other attempts include offering simulated experiences of playing musical instruments through head-mounted display devices. A study shows that a mix of virtual and traditional education can effectively improve music learning results, despite concerns for physical and pedagogical problems including virtual sickness and isolation. The usage of virtual reality in K-12 music education is still widely in experimentation, while research has presented promising results. Some researchers suggest that although attempts with VR showed effectiveness, augmented reality may be preferable in practice because of its support of interaction with real instruments or objects. = History education = With its established ability to create immersive simulated experiences, virtual reality is being evaluated for enhancing the teaching methods for history classes. Research on teaching the history of the Roman Empire with a virtual reconstruction of a Roman city shows significant improve in the learning experiences and academic results for the students. Researchers suggest that the increase in motivation for learning, enhanced interactivity, and the immersive experience are likely key to the success of the experiment, and hold interest for conducting larger-scaled studies on teaching history with virtual reality.  Social skills and collaboration  VR also has uses within primary education for social-emotional development. = Collaboration = VR has applications for development of social skills and multi-user cooperation. It can provide opportunities for students to collaborate through cooperative simulations, and has been shown to support introverted students in their group interactions. One study found VR-based collaboration to create \\"superior collaboration and interaction in the development of outcomes, as compared with other situations where group structures were used.\\" = Autism = Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder, is a series of developmental disorders that impair the abilities of communicating and interacting with other people. While autism typically appears during early childhood, around 1 in 59 children is identified with the autistic condition according to a datasets put up by CDC‚Äôs Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. To combat the negative impacts of autism in learning and socializing in school settings, attempts of using VR to increase students‚Äô adaptation are on the rise. VR simulations have been shown to help children with autism by providing a virtual world in which they can learn to handle real-life scenarios within safe and controlled virtual environments. A study by Strickland et al. (2007) found that children with autism could successfully use virtual worlds to learn skills in fire and street safety, and could apply those skills to real-life situations. One method to facilitate learning experience of autistic students is using virtual reality head-mounted displays (HMDs). According to a study that examines the coping behaviors of using VR headsets in school settings of 32 autistic students between age 6 and age 16, a general preference for ‚Äúcostly and technologically advanced HMDs‚Äù and positive attitudes towards the use of VR technologies, such as enjoyment and excitement are found among students. ‚ÄúDeveloping learning opportunities‚Äù and ‚Äúgoing places virtually and seeing what the world looks like‚Äù are the two primary areas autistic students expect to use HMDs in school for. HMDs also exerts great potential in the future of learning, including relaxing students and creating more learning opportunities at school. Another method is immersing students in virtual scenarios that are common for school settings. Using ‚Äúa 4-side fully immersive CAVETM VR installation‚Äù, it simulates an environment that is ‚Äúan authentic, safe, controllable and manipulable‚Äù to train autistic students to become adaptive in social situations. An example of the scenario is a series of the preparation steps that students normally take before going to school, including brushing teeth, having breakfast and catching school bus. In a study that examines 100 students‚Äô behavior after accepting the training, noticeable changes are shown in ‚Äúemotion recognition, affective expression and social reciprocity‚Äù.  Business and academic reception  The use of virtual reality in primary education has been supported by grants from foundations and venture capital firms. The IEEE held workshops on \\"K-12 Embodied Learning through Virtual & Augmented Reality (KELVAR)\\" in 2016 and 2017. Despite the interest in virtual reality for K-12 education within business and academia, skepticism of its usefulness for K-12 learners has also been expressed. A 2009 review of the literature concluded that only the most independent, intrinsically motivated, and highly skilled K-12 students succeeded with VR. This review traced the problem to a lack of experience with gearing virtual reality to K-12 specifically; most of the experience had been with VR software designed for adults.  Challenges and Concerns  Even though Virtual Reality may be a good supporting tool for students in their studies, there are still certain concerns and challenges that Virtual Reality faces in Primary Education. = Detrimental Effects = There are potential physical, physiological, and psychological problems for users associated with the Virtual Reality system today. Since Virtual reality is a simulated environment, simulator sickness is a concern for the user. Wearing Virtual Reality headset for a long period of time could cause discomfort and poor depth perception for students. This is potentially caused by the short distance between the electronic screen and the eyes of the user. Other potential symptoms include nausea, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and sweating. = User safety = One downside of the fully immersive environment is that the user is not able to sense the real world objects around once he or she goes into the virtual world. Hence, with some amount of required movement during Virtual Reality immersion, collision with real world object becomes a concern because users may easily run into an obstacle and get hurt. In addition, many Virtual Reality equipment sets also include sound cues, and that may block the sense of hearing for sounds in the real world. Without real world sound inputs, users cannot take in notices from others during an accident. = Distinguishing Reality = Similar to video games, an user may become addicted to the world that Virtual Reality technology provides. Virtual Reality immersion can cause a situation where students cannot distinguish reality and virtual reality. This confusion about the real world may result in negative impact on a student‚Äôs physical safety as they might not differentiate dangerous situations happening towards them. Also, students could become confused as they are overloaded by the virtual information they need to learn, complex equipment they need to master, and tasks they need to finish. = Culture = Virtual Reality is still not a technology that is taken seriously and accepted by some people, because they consider it as a game. The attitudes of students can change between whether their task is playing a game, or to think critically and obtain knowledge. Hence, time and effort is needed to spread the potential and positive knowledge of the helpfulness of Virtual Reality in education. = Price = In order to become a primary educational tool, Virtual Reality equipment has to be accessible to every student in the class, instead of inefficiently using one shared Virtual Reality headset and takes up valuable learning time. With low end equipment, users will get low end experiences, while high end Virtual Reality equipment would cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. In order to provide the best Virtual Reality educational environment for students, the use and the affordability of Virtual Reality equipment needs to be considered. = Privacy = As the equipment get smaller in size, the infrastructures that stores data behind gets larger. If Virtual Reality technology become mass used in the same environment, the individual systems and the immersive perceptions of users will be networked together. A large network allows the collection of data from users, and this can lead to a potential surveillance situation where the individual privacy of users are tracked by others and exposed to others.

In Afghanistan, poverty is widespread in rural and urban areas. However, it has been estimated that poverty in Afghanistan is mainly concentrated in rural areas. It has been estimated that four out of five poor people live in rural areas. In these rural areas, families without enough access to adequate nutrition see many infants and children become stunted, malnourished, and die each year. The regions in Afghanistan where almost half of the inhabitants are poor are the East, Northeast, and West-Central regions. According to the Afghan government's estimates, 42 percent of the Afghanistan's total population lives below the poverty line. Also, 20 percent of people living just above the poverty line are highly vulnerable to falling into poverty.Rural poverty in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  Causes  The recent rise of poverty rates in Afghanistan can be associated to the stagnating economy. Currently the poverty line is defined as an income of 70 Afghanis a day, which is equivalent to about 1 U.S. dollar. The Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (ALCS) reported that the national poverty rate has risen from 38% in 2011‚Äì12 to 55% in 2016‚Äì2017, with the slowing economic growth and a deteriorating security situation as two causes. Over half of the population is living off less than a dollar a day. Another finding from the same report showed that from poverty many other problems branch out, as food insecurity has risen by 14.5% in five years, and despite large population growth, the agricultural industry and unemployment have both become increasingly worse. According to Azarakhsh Hafizi, a member of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce, the market economy of Afghanistan cannot operate without the necessary structure of legislation in the government. Another criticism held by members of the Afghanistan Chamber is that foreign aid is doing more damage than helping, even creating an artificial economy based around foreign aid. Despite this cry against foreign aid, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published that in the 2018 Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan an estimated $83,368,135 will be donated to the food security and agriculture sector of the economy. Reports The Afghanistan Poverty Status Update was jointly produced by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's Ministry of Economy and the World Bank. It used the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) data and according to its assessment 36% of Afghan population remained poor in 2007‚Äì08 and in 2012. This meant that more than one in three Afghans did not have enough money to buy food or fulfill their basic needs. This was even puzzling as the GDP growth rate during the same period was 6.9%.Poverty Reduction in Afghanistan: Despite Economic Growth, Widening Inequality A report published by the United Nations Children's Fund in 2018 states that for the first time since 2002, the children out-of-school rate has increased, especially in poverty stricken provinces. Until 2017, no government monitoring on child poverty had taken place in Afghanistan. The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative began working in cooperation with the Central Statistics Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund of Afghanistan to aid the Afghanistan government in creating policies and budgets to help alleviate child poverty. Alleviation =Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS)= The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) 2008‚Äì2013 served as Afghanistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and used the Afghanistan Compact (2006) as a foundation.Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) was launched to serve as the country's poverty reduction strategy. It identifies factors which contribute to poverty such as lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, social inequity, historical and ongoing conflict, and various productivity constraints.Poverty In Afghanistan by Andrew Lokantsov on 27 February 2015 Until 2017, no government monitoring on child poverty had taken place in Afghanistan. The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative began working in cooperation with the Central Statistics Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund of Afghanistan to aid the Afghanistan government in creating policies and budgets to help alleviate child poverty. In order to help restart the public health system in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health created based on the Basic Package of Health Services in 2002. An analysis of the effectiveness of this plan revealed that while the plan was successful in implementing the package to both disabled or female-headed households, the impoverish were still barred off from health centers, hospitals, and private providers that required out of pocket payments. The United Nations Human Refugee Agency (UNHCR) issued a post-return shelter assistance program to assist displaced Afghans coming back to Afghanistan after being refugees in neighboring countries. There was shown to be a 3% decrease of homelessness in areas where this plan was put in place.

Trained medical personnel can determine different treatment options based on the cardiac rhythm of a patient. There are many common heart rhythms that are part of a few different categories, sinus arrhythmia, atrial arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia. Rhythms can be evaluated by measuring a few key components of a rhythm strip, the PQRST sequence, which represents one cardiac cycle, the ventricular rate, which is the rate at which the ventricles contract, and the atrial rate, which is the rate at which the atria contract. PQRST sequence The 5 deviations from the base line on a rhythm strip make up the PQRST sequence. There are a few key intervals that must be measured for proper analysis of a heart rhythm, The PR interval is the interval between the end of the P wave and the beginning of the Q wave. This represents the conduction of the atria of the heart, the speed at which they are able to conduct an electrical impulse. The QRS complex represents the conduction of the ventricles of the heart, the speed at which they are able to conduct an electrical impulse. The interval between each R wave represents the heart rate, which is critical for determining different rhythms within the defined categories. Sinus Arrhythmias There are 6 different sinus arrhythmia. A normal heart should have a normal sinus rhythm, this rhythm can be identified by a ventricular rate of 60-100 bpm, at a regular rate, with a normal PR interval (0.12 to 0.20 second) and a normal QRS complex (0.12 second and less). Sinus bradycardia is another regular rhythm however the ventricular rate is only between 40-60 bpm, with a normal PR interval and a normal QRS complex. Sinus tachycardia is another regular rhythm however the ventricular rate is quicker, between 100 - 160 bpm, with a normal PR interval and normal QRS complex. Sinus arrhythmia is an irregular rhythm with a ventricular rate of 60 - 100 normally, however a slow rhythm can be distinguished when the rate is less than 60, the PR interval and QRS complex are normal. Sinus pause is a regular rhythm however a sudden pause occurs in the rhythm which makes it miss a few beats, if the rhythm resumes on time after the pause then this is known as a sinus block, if the rhythm does not resume on time after the pause this is known as a sinus arrest. Atrial Arrhythmias There are 5 different atrial arrhythmias. A wondering atrial pace maker can be either normal or irregular in rate, much like a sinus arrhythmia the rate is normally between 60 - 100 bpm when it is normal and less than 60 when it is slow, the distinguishing feature of this rhythm is a p wave that varies in size, shape, and direction, the PR interval can wither be normal or irregular depending on the location of conduction of the PR interval, the QRS complex is normal. A premature atrial pacemaker has a regular underlying rhythm however there is a premature beat which can be identified by an irregular p wave with a different size, shape, and direction often found within a T wave, the PR interval is generally normal however can be hard to measure, the QRS complex is premature for the PAC, but is generally normal. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia has a regular rate, however a high rate of about 140-250 bpm, p waves are generally hidden and the PR interval is not measurable. Atrial Flutter has an atrial rate of 250-400 and can be identified by p waves with saw tooth deflections. Atrial fibrillation has an atrial rate of 400+ and is distinguishable die to its irregular ventricular rate and wavy deflections. Ventricular arrhythmias Ventricular fibrillation Ventricular arrhythmias are some of the most dangerous heart rhythms requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation in cases of symptomatic Ventricular tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation. There are 5 different ventricular arrhymia. Ventricular Tachycardia is a regular rhythm with a rate of 140-250 bpm, there are no P waves and the main feature is a wide QRS complex (0.12 and greater) Ventricular Fibrillation has no p waves or QRS complexes, there are only wavy irregular deflections throughout the heart rhythm, at this point the heart would have a rate of 0 and be supplying no blood through the body. Idioventricular rhythm this is a regular rhythm identifiable by a wide QRS complex with absent P waves, and a rate between 30-40 bpm. An Accelerated IVR is also a regular rhythm with a wide QRS complex and absent P waves, however the rate is between 50-100 bpm. The final rhythm is Ventricular Standstill this rhythm will appear as a flat line, but may have a few non conducted p waves, the heart rate of this will be 0 and be supplying no blood through the body like ventricular fibrillation.

The film is about William the Conqueror when he is about to embark from Dives-sur-Mer to conquer England in the year 1066. In the event that he would not return alive, William introduced his son Robert to his loyal barons to receive the ducal throne heritage. We then have an extensive flashback. William's father Duke Robert declares William his heir before departing for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The barons swear loyalty. However, Robert dies and William, still a child, has to flee. We then see a long sequence with William as a fugitive. Finally, as a young man, he persuades the King of France to lend him an army. He wins a crucial battle and becomes Duke. During the 1066 sections of the film, William tells a friend that it is not the weather that is delaying him. At the end, he gets a messenger from Norway. Presumably this tells him that Harold Hardrada is invading England, which will pull Harold Godwinson north and make the conquest much more likely to succeed.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  X. bulbulata was first described by Achille Guen√©e in 1868. In 1883 Edward Meyrick placed the species within the genus Larentia. In 1898 George Vernon Hudson assigned the species to the genus Xanthorhoe.  Original description  Guen√©e described the species as follows:  Distribution and habitat  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Historically this moth was distributed throughout much of the South Island with records obtained from as far north as Awapiri in the Awatere valley down to Invercargill. The moths could be found in \\"open, grassy places\\" from sea level to elevations of 660-930m. Records suggest that the moth was once \\"common\\" between September and March.  Species decline  Despite having been common in New Zealand up to the 1930s, since 1 January 1940 there have been only two recorded collections of X. bulbulata. These were a male found flying during the day in Queenstown in 1979 and a female caught in a light trap between February and March 1991 at the Eastern entrance to the Kawarau Gorge. Intensive sampling for this moth covering 285 sites between 1995 and 2000 returned no specimens. It is thought that the documented decline in this species is the result of ecological changes to habitats following European settlement.  Conservation status  This species has the \\"Nationally Critical\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

He has published three poetry collections to date: Yeojangnamja Sikoku (Ïó¨Ïû•ÎÇ®Ïûê ÏãúÏΩîÏø† Sikoku, the Man Dressed as Woman) (2005); Teuraekgwa deulpanui byeol (Ìä∏ÎûôÍ≥º Îì§ÌåêÏùò Î≥Ñ Tracks and Stars in the Field) (2007); and Yukchaeshowa jeonjip (Ïú°Ï≤¥ÏáºÏôÄ Ï†ÑÏßë Body Show and Complete Works) (2013). In 2012, his work appeared in a special issue featuring Korean poetry (\\"Po&sie-Cor;√©e‚Äô\\") by the French poetry magazine Po&sie.; He won the 11th Park In-Hwan Literary Award in 2010 and the 13th Midang Literary Award in 2013.  Writing  Hwang Byungsng's first poetry collection Yeojangnamja Sikoku (Ïó¨Ïû•ÎÇ®Ïûê ÏãúÏΩîÏø† Sikoku, the Man Dressed as Woman) was one of the most widely discussed books in South Korean literary circles during the 2000s. The collection was noted for its open display of desire and impulse, and for its abstract portrayal of objects and spaces. His poetic diction and voice were also very different from conventional Korean poetry. Critics would later describe him as \\"carrying out, through the play of signifiers, the near impossible work of restoring the world we lost to its original form\\" (Gwon Hyeok-ung) or as \\"a powerful detonator that will blow up the ideology of authenticity in modern Korean poetry and its tedious standards\\" (Lee Gwang-ho). On the other hand, Hwang has been criticized for using \\"language that does not communicate\\" and writing \\"incomprehensible poetry\\". As mixed opinions of his work continued to build, he became one of the most talked about poets in the 2000s. As its title suggests, Hwang's first poetry collection explores queer themes and divided subjects by bringing to the forefront the \\"man dressed as a woman\\", a character of no clear gender. His second poetry collection Teuraekgwa deulpanui byeol (Ìä∏ÎûôÍ≥º Îì§ÌåêÏùò Î≥Ñ Tracks and Stars in the Field) portrays the wanderings, rebellions, and romances of children who failed to grow up. In this sense, the collection takes readers to a strange fairy-tale world that defies the existing, adult world. Hwang uses a collage of imagery and juxtaposes various stories to powerful effect. Told in a unique format, the stories are ultimately a vast, ironical criticism of the real world at large. Hwang's third poetry collection Yukchaeshowa jeonjip (Ïú°Ï≤¥ÏáºÏôÄ Ï†ÑÏßë Body Show and Complete Works) sharply ridicules the existing social order, focusing on the idea of failure.

The first national military of independent Azerbaijan including an army, navy, and air force was formed in the same year. The Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan was established on September 5, 1991. In this year the system of the army structure and first brigades were created, and forming process of national staff for the military forces has been started. During this period the military forces were a leading power structure in Azerbaijan. The first steps in modernizing the armed forces were made in Azerbaijan, with improvements in weapons and techniques, and the upgrading of the army's armored cars. Azerbaijan began choosing strategic allies and establishing priorities for national security. In July 1992, Azerbaijan approved the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe by which limits on conventional military equipment were created.https://static.dvidshub.net/media/pubs/pdf_2726.pdf After being elected the President of Azerbaijan in 1993, the government of Heydar Aliyev started to create a single army. In November 1993, Azerbaijani parliament passed the Law on Defense. After signing ceasefire with Armenia in 1994, the country gained opportunities to conduct reforms in the Armed Forces. Constructive work and structural reforms carried out in the Armed Forces led to the planning of battle-related objectives under centralized management, management of the military divisions according to the requirements of proper military science, and improvement of the personnel.

In 2017, he wrote and authored his memoirs, Ocean Rift: Memoirs of Admiral Lodhi, published in 2017 that recounted his memories during the events in 1971. Biography Lodhi served in the Royal Indian Navy, participating well during the World War II, he was one of few of the twenty RIN officers from the Executive Branch who opted for Pakistan Navy in 1947; he was the Lieutenant at the time of his transfer.

Captain Lodhi was the commanding officer of the PNS Babur and had responsibility of guarding the station. Under Captain Lodhi's command, the PNS Babur took part in the firing the target at the light house's radars and return home safely to report to its base, and served until 1967 as Babur's CO.

He also deployed his country's only long-range submarine, Ghazi that had to be deployed since he was not given any choice to support the Eastern Naval Command under Rear- Admiral Mohammad Shariff. He also appointed Commodore H.H. Ahmed as his command's chief of staff. After the signed surrender went into effect that marked the succession of East-Pakistan as Bangladesh, Rear-Admiral Lodhi was among the highest flag ranking officer, including Rear-Admiral Rashid Ahmed and Vice-Admiral Muzaffar Hassan, who were notably superseded by their juniors for the command assignments. Rear-Admiral Lodhi was subsequently forcefully retired from his service when the junior, Commodore H.H. Ahmed , became the nation's first chief of naval staff in April 1972. After his retirement, Rear- Admiral Lodhi deputed and worked with Royal Saudi Navy as its military adviser and remained associated with it for quite some time.

Her novels portray not so much the fate of people embroiled in some kind of conflict as their psychological state when they contemplate a situation or idea. She focuses on recording spontaneous thoughts or flashbacks, rather than on describing something accurately or developing a dramatic arc. In this absence of a clear plot, the reading experience consists mostly of following the author‚Äôs thought process. This is why Han‚Äôs work can be considered an example of the French nouveau roman or antinovel.  Life  Han Yujoo was born in 1982 in Seoul, South Korea. After graduating Dongdaejeon High School, she studied German language and literature at Hongik University and completed graduate-level coursework in Aesthetics at Seoul National University. She began her writing career almost by chance. In her final year of high school, she submitted three or four applications to undergraduate programs, including Russian literature, that she supposed would allow her to read as much as possible. She finally chose to enroll in a German literature program. She read extensively, as she had expected, and her university life remained largely uneventful until she took an elective course in creative writing offered by the Korean literature department at her school. Without harboring literary ambitions anywhere as strong as the creative writing majors in her class, she wrote a short story entitled ‚ÄúDalo‚Äù (Îã¨Î°ú To the Moon) for her final project. She showed the story to a friend interested in literature, who encouraged her to send in the story to writing contests. She submitted it to a contest held by the literary journal Literature and Society and won, which officially marked her literary debut. She pursued her master's degree in her mid-twenties, during which she stayed in Paris for around five months. Currently, she writes, translates, and teaches at a university. She is a member of Ru, an experimental writers‚Äô association, and is the founder of the publisher Oulipopress. She was briefly a member of the band The Chop, along with poets Kiwan Sung and Hwang Byungsng. In an interview at the 2016 Seoul International Writers‚Äô Festival, Han stated that her involvement with the band was so long ago she barely remembered it, and that she only participated in two shows. She did recall bringing an instrument she was not yet familiar with and performing poorly, having only agreed to perform because a literary colleague had reached out to her in need of a session musician. In 2008 and 2012, she was funded by LTI Korea to partake in the Overseas Residency Program for Korean Writers in New York and Provence, respectively. In 2013, she joined the Artience Residency offered by Arts Council Korea.  Writing  Unlike some writers who receive critical and popular acclaim due to their exceptional narrative or character development, Han Yujoo intentionally veers away from standard practices in fiction writing and succeeds in creating a unique literary voice. Her work holds appeal for some readers and critics because she refuses to craft a meticulously structured narrative and does not attempt to produce memorable scenes through characters or events. In a favorable review of Han‚Äôs experimental style, literary critic Hwang Ho-deok writes: ‚ÄúBut can there be a writer who does not want to write? Such a person is probably not a writer at all. Then what about writers who want to write about not writing? To tell a story about not telling one? There are some, if not many, writers like that right now. They write about action with no action, all the while attempting to erase even that writing itself. They jest that they deny their own being (and their writing); they have decided to become nothing. They are skeptical of the narrative, the message, and even meaning. The ‚Äòfirst to realize the futility of language,‚Äô they are the ones giving today‚Äôs Korean literature a ‚Äòdevastating brilliance.‚Äô‚Äù Han‚Äôs work has also received negative reviews. Some critics argue that her language is superfluous, her experiments derivative, and her works closer to miscellanies of essays rather than novels. It can be argued that Han Yujoo stands on the boundaries of linguistic experimentation that Korean literature is undergoing in the 21st century.

Early life and family First International Exhibition in America Opened in Crystal Palace, New York, by Charles Cushing Wright (1796‚Äì1854) Hannah Amelia Wright was born in New York City on August 18, 1836. She was the daughter of engraver and medalist Charles Cushing Wright (1796‚Äì1854) and Lavinia Delliber (died July 6, 1860), a Huguenot from Charleston, South Carolina. Hannah received her education at home. Until her thirteenth year, she lived in Louisiana but returned to New York in 1849. Career Wright began an independent career by writing fiction. Her stories were published, but she turned her attention to music. In 1860 Wright obtained a position as teacher of music in the New York Institute for the Blind. After eleven years teaching, she was preparing to go abroad to study music, when she became interested in the care of the insane. She decided to study medicine. In 1871 Wright entered the New York Medical College for Women and graduated in 1874. She organized the college's alumni association serving for several years as its secretary and afterward as its presiding officer. Shortly after graduation, Wright tried for a position in one of the State asylums for the insane as an assistant physician, but she was refused the position twice on the contention that women were not eligible. In 1878 Wright obtained the position of \\"examiner in lunacy\\", being the first woman to be appointed in that role. Wright was successful, establishing a large and remunerative practice. Realizing the necessity for women physicians in the field of gynecology, she devoted herself to that branch of the practice of medicine as a specialist. Affiliations and memberships In 1878 Wright was made a trustee of the New York Medical College for Women. While serving as secretary of the board of trustees, she used her influence to establish women in the chairs of that college, and it was mainly through her determination and perseverance that women succeeded men as professors in that institution.

History =Empire of Japan= In 1918, while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the plan to establish a paper mill was initiated by Japanese merchants. In 1919, the paper mill was established under the corporation name Taiwan Paper K.K. which became the first paper mill in Taiwan. =Republic of China= After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China, the government took over the paper mill with the other four mills around Taiwan. They merged them into the Taiwan Paper Corporation which then became a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At the end of 1954, the corporation was privatized and renamed Taiwan Paper Co., Ltd.; subsequently, the mill was renamed Shihlin Mill of Taiwan Paper Co., Ltd. In 1954, Taiwan Paper Corporation was divided into several parts and managed separately. Shihlin Mill was acquired by the private sector. In 1959, the mill was renamed Shihlin Paper Co., Ltd. In 1998, in order to accommodate the expansion of urban development throughout the Shilin area, the production center of the mill was moved to Taoyuan County. In 2003, the mill and its related lands and buildings were transferred to its subsidiary Sunshine Shihlin Development Co., Ltd. for redevelopment.

Location The village lay on the road between Athyras (modern B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece) and Rhegion (modern K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece), near the modern suburb of Ho≈ük√∂y. In the 18th century, it was erroneously localized at Kƒ±nƒ±klƒ±, west of Silivri; Konrad Miller located it not at Ho≈ük√∂y, but at Yarƒ±mburgaz further east. History The origin of the settlement is unknown. It has been suggested that the name derives from the ancient Thracian tribe of the Melanditae, but it is more likely that the name (from the root melas, \\"black\\") was given due to the area's black soil. Due to its location on one of the main roads leading to Byzantion/Constantinople, the village is mentioned in the late Roman itineraries such as the Tabula Peutingeriana or the Ravenna Cosmography. An imperial villa is attested in Melantias during Emperor Valens' ill-fated campaign against the Goths in 378. As a suburb of Constantinople, Melantias is often mentioned in conjunction with enemy raids or invasions targeting the imperial capital. Thus according to Michael the Syrian the town was raided by the Ostrogoths under Theoderic the Great in 486/87, while Agathias records that the Kutrigurs under Zabergan camped there in 558/89, shortly before they were defeated and driven back by Belisarius in the Battle of Melantias. During the Avar‚ÄìSlavic siege of Constantinople in 626, the Avar vanguard made camp at Melantias before reaching the capital. In 886, Emperor Basil I the Macedonian was killed in a hunting accident somewhere between Melantias and Apameia. By , according to the Suda encyclopedia, Melantias was commonly known as Melitias (ŒúŒµŒªŒπœÑŒπ·Ω∞œÇ). In the early 14th century, the village belonged to the landowner Eudokia of Constantinople. Melantias is last mentioned in late June 1385, when another battle was fought there, between Emperor John V Palaiologos and his usurping son, Andronikos IV Palaiologos. Andronikos was defeated, and fled to Selymbria (Silivri), where he died after a few days.

This prompted a F-4EJ Phantom fighter of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) to fire warning shots on two occasions.

Aftermath Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita protested the violation of Japan's airspace On the evening of December 9, the Japanese ministry of foreign affairs announced that they would protest the airspace violation to the Soviet government. The Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stated that it was regrettable that a nuclear capable bomber had violated Japan's airspace the day after the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed between the USSR and the USA. On December 10, Kazuyoshi Hasegawa of the ministry of foreign affairs summoned Nikolai Soloviev, Soviet ambassador to Japan, and expressed Japan's displeasure. Hasegawa requested facts and demanded the punishment of those responsible. The Soviet side blamed poor weather and instrument failure. However, the weather at that time was sunny. On December 11, a Soviet press conference announced that the responsible person would be punished, but no formal answer was made. On December 17, the Japanese foreign minister S≈çsuke Uno spoke to the Soviet Vice-Foreign minister Anatolii Leonidovich Adamishin. On December 25 the Soviet ambassador Soloviev explained the situation. At his retirement speech on January 14, 1988 Lieutenant General Edward L Tixier, the commander of the US Fifth Air Force mentioned that US aircraft had also been airborne, monitoring the situation.

Functions The CNS has the following three main functions. =Communication= Communication, i.e. aviation communication, refers to radio communication between two or more aircraft, or the exchange of data or verbal information between aircraft and air traffic control. For continental airspace, VHF (civil) and UHF (military) systems are used whereas for oceanic areas, high frequency systems and SATCOMs are used. =Navigation= Navigation, i.e. air navigation, refers to the process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of an aircraft from one place to another by providing accurate, reliable and seamless position determination capability. =Surveillance= Surveillance systems are used by air traffic control to determine the position of aircraft. There are two types of surveillance systems: Cooperative systems Cooperative systems (a.k.a. dependent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as SSR) communicate with equipment (such as transponders) on board the aircraft to determine the position and other details of the aircraft. Aircraft information, which may include position from GNSS or other means is determined on board and then transmitted to ATC in response to interrogation. Other cooperative systems such as ADS-B rely on aircraft transmitting their position and other information without interrogation from the ground. Non-cooperative systems Non-cooperative systems (a.k.a. independent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as PSR) are able to locate the aircraft and measure its position from the ground by transmitting pulses of radio waves which reflect off the aircraft's hull.

On 1 January 1349, before the plague had spread to the Upper Rhine, suspicious Jews were arrested in Freiburg at the instigation of the city council for well poisoning. Whilst being tortured, most of them denied the allegations and accused Jews from other areas through mortal fear. After a pogrom took place at the beginning of January 1349 in Basel, with the exception of pregnant women, all Jews living in Freiburg were burned on the Friday before Candlemas Day on 31 January due to their misdeeds and murders, which they had instigated and admitted to. The children of those who had been executed were forced to be baptised.Berent Schwinek√∂per und Franz Lauenberger: Geschichte und Schicksal Freiburger Juden (= Freiburger Stadthefte 6). 1963, S. #. In 1360, the city council allowed the Jews to resettle, but there was great uncertainty and at the request of the city on 14 September 1394, the Austrian landlord, Duke Leopold IV, issued an order stating that all Jews had to wear Jewish hats and jackets. They also prohibited the wearing of liturgical colours such as red and green and prohibited them from Easter Week. As a result of news of ritual killings against Christians in distant Bavaria, on 4 July 1401, the city council, after consulting Duke Leopold, announced the expulsion of all Jews from the pulpits. The councillors solemnly signed the decree dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol (no Jews may set foot in Freiburg ever again)Peter P. Albert: Achthundert Jahre Freiburg im Breisgau 1120‚Äì1920.

From 1411 onwards, Jews were accepted again in Freiburg, but during the time of the imperial city (1415-1527), King Sigismund officially confirmed the decree of 1401 with the Eternal Expulsion in 1424.  Enlightenment and the 19th century  Memorial to the deportation of Freiburg's Jews to the Gurs internment camp (in southern France) in the form of a traffic sign The situation regarding the Jews only changed when Emperor Joseph II proclaimed the Patent of Toleration in 1782. The patent formally lifted the existing \\"Jewish laws\\" but there were still restrictions on Jewish people's everyday lives. Although Jews were now allowed to attend higher schools and universities, they were still not considered as full-time citizens in Freiburg. In 1809, the city council assaigned a Jewish inn to the Jews in Gr√ºnw√§lderstra√üe. The inn's first tenant was the first Jewish citizen of Freiburg.Astrid Fritz, Bernhard Thill: Unbekanntes Freiburg. Spazierg√§nge zu den Geheimnissen einer Stadt. Rombach Verlag, Freiburg 2005, , S. 45f. In 1830, when Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, who recognised the constitutional monarchy as a learned political scientist, had taken office, the state parliament debated about the emancipation of the Jews. There was however resistance to the debates of 1831 in the second chamber. Karl von Rotteck, in particular, became the spokesman for the representatives, who had demanded that the Jews deserved extended rights with increased integration. in 1835, the Grand Duke abolished all special charges against the Jews.Dieser Schritt wurde von Karl von Rotteck kritisiert, der daf√ºr war, den 'bisherigen Rechtszustand beizubehalten', so: Astrid Fritz, Bernhard Thill: Unbekanntes Freiburg. Spazierg√§nge zu den Geheimnissen einer Stadt. Rombach Verlag, Freiburg 2005, , S. 45f. As late as 1862, there was fierce resistance in Freiburg, especially against the freedom of movement. The merchants in particular wanted to keep the banning of the Jews in Freiburg, which had existed since 1425 and confirmed in 1809, in fear of competition. In a petition to the state parliament, it was said that we are become a nest for Jews. Between 1869 and 1870, the Old Synagogue was built according to plans set out by Georg Jakob Schneider in Rempartstra√üe (later Werthmannplatz, now the Platz der Alten Synagoge). In 1870, the Jewish Cemetery in Freiburg was first used and is still in use to this day.  National Socialism  Commemorative plaque ‚ÄûWagner-B√ºrckel‚Äú campaign at the Platz der alten Synagoge At the end of January 1933 in Berlin, the seizing of control by the National Socialists quickly spread through Freiburg. On 6 March, the Nazis, without the consent of Mayor Karl Bender, hoisted the Swastika flag at Freiburg's City Hall. On 17 March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the Social Democratic and Jewish parliamentary representative Christian Daniel Nu√übaum was arrested, who then fatally injured a police officer with a shot through the apartment door.Diethard H. Klein (Hrsg.): Freiburg. Ein Lesebuch. Husum Verlag, Husum 1987, S. #. In the course of events, the publishing house of Volkswacht (Freiburg), or People's Guard, was stormed by members of the NSDAP, SA, SS and Der Stahlhelm, who threw 16,000 freshly printed newspapers onto the street and tried to light them. Journalist and Social Democrat K√§the Vordtriede thereby lost her job. On 18 March, all local organisations of the SPD and KPD, including their auxiliary and subsidiary organisations, were dissolved in Freiburg.Hans und Inge Kaufmann: Verfolgung, Widerstand, Neubeginn in Freiburg 1933-1945. Verlag Armbruster, Br√§ndle, Hubert, Freiburg im Breisgau 1989. On 28 March 1933, the Jewish SPD city councillor Max Mayer resigned his mandate as a result of the Provisional Law for the Co-ordination of Countries with the Reich. On 31 March 1933, SPD city councillor Robert Grumbach also resigned his mandate for the same reason.Ulrich P. Ecker, Christiane Pfanz-Sponagel: Die Geschichte des Freiburger Gemeinderats unter dem Nationalsozialismus. (= Neue Reihe des Stadtarchivs Freiburg im Breisgau. Heft 21). 2008, , S. 20. The Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses was only followed halfheartedly by the citizens of Freiburg. As in many places across Germany, during the Kristallnacht on 10 November 1938, the Old Synagogue went up in flames. Subsequently, 100 men aged 18 or older were taken to Dachau concentration camp north of Munich for \\"protective custody\\" and immigration detention.Wolf Middendorff: Als die Synagogen im Breisgau brannten. In: Freiburger Almanach. 30, 67, 1979. On 22 October 1940, as across Baden, the deportation of the Jews took place in Freiburg in accordance to the framework set out by the Wagner-B√ºrckel campaign. They were originally taken to Gurs internment camp near the Spanish border and then later to the extermination camps. Numerous \\"Stolpersteine\\" were installed across Freiburg as a way of recollecting those taken to the camps. The project \\"Vordtriede-Haus Freiburg\\" is devoted to the journalist K√§the Vordtriede and her children who had emigrated. She was the first female journalist of the newspaper Volkswacht. In the city district of Rieselfeld, a street is named after her since 2003. Stolpersteine for the Abraham and Grumbacher families, Eisenbahnstra√üe 66  Modern times  On 7 September 1945, a Jewish worship service took place in Freiburg for the first time in five years. For this purpose, the city provided a room at the Historical Merchants' Hall. The Israeli Rural Community of South Baden founded in Freiburg at the end of 1945, had its headquarters located on Hansjakobstra√üe 8.Joachim Hahn, J√ºrgen Kr√ºger: Synagogen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Band 2: Joachim Hahn: Orte und Einrichtungen. Theiss, Stuttgart 2007, , S. 131 (Gedenkbuch der Synagogen in Deutschland. Band 4) On 11 November 1947, the city made former city councillor Robert Grumbach deputy for all Jews in Freiburg an honorary citizen. On 1 December 1948, the city and state carried out a settlement with the Jewish community, according to which the city would remain the owner of the former synagogue site. In return, the city undertook a restoration of the Jewish cemetery, the walled-in cemetery and the building of a guard house with a cemetery hall. In 1953, the Jewish community supported by the French military rabbis set up a prayer room on Holbeinstra√üe 25. The number of Jews living in Freiburg in 1968 was 225. On 16 June 1985, the foundations were laid for a new synagogue, which was opened on 5 November 1985. It was built near the minster on land which the city had provided free of charge. The city paid over one million Deutschmarks for the construction costs, the state provided a further 3.5 million out of the 7 million Deutschmarks required.

Bin tippers are a type of lifting equipment used in many industries, including waste management, food processing, chemical manufacturing and facility management. Although bin tippers are often components of larger machines (such as garbage trucks), an increasing number of 'standalone' or mobile units are available. Most bin tippers use mains electricity to power the lifting system, but some are powered by batteries, solar, crank-handle, or compressed air.  Operational principal  Bin tippers typically have a steel frame, guarding and cradle, with a motor or crank-handle driving a lifting mechanism, which may be hydraulic or chain operated. Bins are placed into the machine, then lifted and inverted over the destination receptacle, allowing the contents to be emptied by gravity. Most bin tippers are designed to comply with one of three standards: * EN 840-compliant bin tippers use a comb-lift mechanism, latching onto reinforced combing around the lip of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the waste-management industry in Europe, Asia and Australasia. Compliant bins are often called wheelie bins or MGBs. * ANSI Z245.60 (Type B)-compliant bin tippers use a front-lift mechanism, latching onto a moulded indentation in the front of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the waste-management industry in North America. Compliant bins are often called toters, waste carts or trash cans. * DIN 9797-compliant bin tippers use a trunnion-lift mechanism, latching onto two trunnions projecting from the sides of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the food-processing industry. Compliant bins are often called euro bins, tote bins, or meat carts. * Bin tippers may also use various non-standard means to secure the bin, including hydraulic pincers, or base-lift cradles with wheel latches or chain fastenings.  History  A side-load bin tipper was fitted to a garbage truck as early as 1929, by the Heil company in America. In the 1950s the Dempster Dumpmaster popularized the front-end loader variant, with bins being tipped over the cab of the truck. Both types of integrated bin tipper are now common on municipal refuse collection trucks. Standalone bin tippers developed later, with the release of a machine called the Simpro Ezi-Dump in 1990. This type of machine is now common on large commercial facilities, events venues and campuses, since it allows smaller mobile bins to be dispersed for waste collection, then emptied into a skip bin or dumpster; which in turn can be emptied by a front-load garbage truck. The use of bin tippers and other lifting aids has been stimulated in recent years by research linking heavy manual lifting with musculoskeletal disorders; some government organisations, schools and companies now prohibit emptying bins by hand. Health and safety concerns have also driven the adoption of bin tippers in the manufacturing, food-processing and construction industries.

Its origins are earlier, as a clas church from the 5th to the 7th centuries. Further building, including the construction of the second nave, took place in the late 15th or early 16th centuries. Its importance was as an embarkation point for the abbey on Bardsey Island which became a significant site of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. The Reformation saw the church's decline, and by the 19th century it was a ruin. In the 1850s a new church, Eglwys Newydd, was constructed inland, but proved so unpopular that St Hywyn's was restored. The Welsh poet R. S. Thomas was minister at the church, which is a Grade I listed building. History The origins of the church are as a clas settlement from the Dark Ages of the 5th to the 7th centuries. The clas was founded by St Hywyn, an early Welsh Saint. The settlement rose in importance after 1190 when Bardsey Island, the \\"Island of 20,000 Saints\\", and St Davids in Pembrokeshire where declared places of pilgrimage by the Papacy. The writer Simon Jenkins notes that visits to both sites equated to a single pilgrimage to Rome. St Hywyn's expanded greatly to accommodate the very large numbers of pilgrims sailing to Bardsey Abbey, who were fed and watered in the Great Kitchen (Y Gegin Fawr) next to the church. The present building is first recorded in 1115 and further building took place in the 14th and 15th centuries. Following the Reformation, the church declined, experiencing a long history of non-resident clergy. By the 1840s, it had become ruinous and a new church was built further inland. The new church provide to be unpopular, however, and by 1868 the original church had been restored and brought back into use. Further restorations took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. The church, known as \\"The Cathedral of Llyn\\", remains an active church in the Bro Enlli Ministry Area. The poet R. S. Thomas was minister at the church from 1967 to 1978. Architecture and description The church comprises two naves, of equal length but of differing dates; the Northern is largely 12th century while the Southern dates from the 14th century. The building is constructed of rubble with slate roofs and a bellcote. The interior, which was refurbished in 2006 has a hammerbeam roof. The internal arcade is of the 15th century and is described as \\"distinguished\\" in the Gwynedd volume of The Buildings of Wales. Two carved boulders within the church commemorate a pair of 5th or 6th century priests, Veracius and Senacus. The church is a Grade I listed building, its listing recording the church as \\"one of the major churches of the Lleyn\\". Notable burials The local herbalist Alice Griffith was buried here in 1821.

She is particularly known for her work on sustainability and ecological issues in fashion. Early life and education Blanchard was born in Liverpool and took a fashion journalism course at Central Saint Martins. Journalism In 1998 Blanchard started up a biannual fashion and visual arts magazine titled IT, for which she was publisher and co-editor. She was also at The Independent as a fashion editor, and from 1999 to 2005 was Style Editor at The Observer. She then joined The Daily Telegraph as style director for their magazine. The Fashion Museum, Bath, chose Blanchard as the fashion journalist to select the most defining looks of 1996 for their Dress of the Year collection. She picked out an Alexander McQueen tunic and 'bumster' trousers from his \\"Hunger\\" collection for the womenswear look, and a man's Paul Smith electric blue two- piece suit and shirt. At the press launch, the clothes were modelled by Jimmy Pursey and his then partner Tizer Bailey, the model who had originally worn the McQueen ensemble in the designer's catwalk presentation. Blanchard said at the time that McQueen, who had recently succeeded John Galliano as the designer for Givenchy, was one of the strongest representations of mid- nineties \\"cutting-edge style,\\" whilst Smith's suit represented the revolution in menswear where the male consumer was increasingly aware of labels and design. Blanchard is also a fashion correspondent for the Victoria and Albert Museum's magazine and a contributing editor to 10 Magazine. She has also contributed to Vogue, Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar and Rubbish. Blanchard has been invited to teach fashion journalism at the University of Westminster and Central Saint Martins. Author Blanchard's best-known book is probably Green is the New Black: How to Change the World with Style, published in 2007 and dealing with ecological awareness in a fashion-conscious lifestyle. TreeHugger reviewed the book favourably, noting that while Blanchard was not as authoritative on eco-issues as Lucy Siegle, she had still written a well- informed, fair-handed book that wrote accessibly about how to be both fashion- conscious and environmentally aware, and the EcoSalon website listed it as among their top 15 books on eco-fashion. The book established Blanchard as an authority on the subject of eco-consciousness in fashion, leading to her being approached for commentary on the topic. =Selected bibliography=   Personal life Blanchard lives in London with her partner and their children.

Johnson's father getting portrait taken at Beard's London studio in the 1840s using Wolcott style mirror camera. John Johnson (May 28, 1813 ‚Äì May 3, 1871) was a watchmaker technician and maker of dental instruments. He was a nineteenth-century experimental photographer and inventor. With a business partner he made the first patented camera that took photographs. They started the world's first commercial portrait studio. Johnson developed portrait studio franchises throughout England and sold photography license rights.  Early life  Johnson was born in Saco, Maine on May 28, 1813. His father was William Short Johnson.  Mid life  Johnson lived his childhood and got his initial schooling in Pembroke, New Hampshire. The first job he obtained was in 1832, as an assistant to a watchmaker in New York City. In 1837 he formed a business with Alexander S. Wolcott in the city making dental instruments.  Career  On October 6, 1839, Johnson took to Wolcott a detailed copy of the specifications on Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre's method of capturing a likeness of a person. Wolcott was familiar with the mechanics of optics and experimented on improving Daguerre's basic methods of using lenses. He made a camera that day with improvements on the basic design. The camera was a wooden box 15 inches long, 8.5 inches high, and 8 inches wide, with a 7-inch concave mirror in the back. The camera had a large opening in front where the light rays reflected from the person passed through an aperture to display their portrait image. The photo-sensitive two-inch exposure plate was in a detachable frame in the center of this aperture opening, just inside the box. The operator of the camera would set up the focusing of the portrait picture on a non-sensitized plate first. Once the camera was focused with all of the mechanical items involved, the camera operator would replace the focusing plate with the sensitized plate to take the picture. Wolcott realized that exposure time could be reduced by improving the mechanical arrangement of the image-focusing process. He did this with a concave reflector of a 3‚Äì4 inch diameter that produced a short focus length. The focused image was formed onto a chemically treated silver surfaced plate that was sensitive to light. The plate was about 2 by 2.5 inches and could hold the picture indefinitely. Johnson and his partner Wolcott started experimenting with the Daquerre camera design on October 6, 1839. Wolcott had constructed a workable camera within 24 hours and took a picture of Johnson. Wolcott took this picture on October 7, the first portrait in the world. On March 4, 1840, they opened the first studio in the world as a commercial enterprise for taking portrait pictures of people. The customer would sit for their likeness to be captured on a permanent medium for future viewing. The commercial photography studio was located in New York City at Broadway and Chamber Street. Johnson with Wolcott created the world's first photography portrait studio as a business. They opened their commercial daguerreotype photography portrait studio in March 1840. = Europe = Wolcott's camera design details were taken to London by Johnson's father, William S. Johnson, in February 1840 with the intention of getting an English patent. A European franchise financial arrangement was worked out by him with Richard Beard, a coal merchant and entrepreneur. Johnson himself traveled to London in the fall of 1840 to give technical instructions to Beard who was setting up a photographer's studio on top of the Royal Polytechnic Institution located on Regent Street. They hired John Frederick Goddard, a chemist and optics technician, to help set up the studio. Beard then developed franchises of portrait studios throughout England using British Patent 8546 that he bought from Johnson for a claimed amount of . Goddard came up a chemistry formula using iodine monobromide to make the image plate sensitive to light so that an image would develop on it much faster than the daguerreotype cameras of the time. The image plate used iodine chloride to make the plates sensitive to light, which helped to shorten the camera exposure time. The concave mirror reflector improvement and the photo- sensitive plate were the key innovative features Wolcott based his 1840 camera invention on that made portraits a possibility. This made exposure time to as low as a few minutes in bright sunlight and since a person could be still for that time it make portraits possible using this state-of-the-art photography. Beard then opened the first public portrait studio of Europe in London in March 1841, the Daguerrean gallery at the Polytechnic Institute. Johnson in 1842 received a patent in the United States for prepared photographic plates ready for permanently holding images. This was the first patented camera that took photographs. He obtained from Beard the patent rights for taking daguerreotype portrait pictures in the counties of Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire in England. He opened a portrait studio in 1843 next to the Athenaeum on Victoria Street in Derby. Johnson in 1844 sold the studio to William Akers and sold the English daguerreotype licence for Derbyshire to Thomas Roberts, a newsagent.  Later life  Johnson was treasurer of the American Photographic Society. In 1866 he became the first president of York Institute, an educational organization. Johnson died on May 3, 1871, in Saco, Maine.  Legacy  An 1840 model of Wolcott-Johnson's portrait camera was discovered in 1976 at the Saco Museum in Maine. It was deposited there by Johnson when he was the first curator of the museum, which was known as the York Institute.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The original section of Three Rivers, including what is now the downtown and some surrounding residential areas, was platted in 1836 by John H. Bowman. This location immediately began to serve as the commercial center of the settlement, with modest wooden buildings constructed along what is now Main Street as early as the 1830s. A number of mills were constructed in the area in the 1830s and 1840s, and in 1851 the Lockport Hydraulic Company was formed to dam the river and construct a power canal. This was followed in 1853 by the construction of a railroad line through the village. As a result, Three Rivers boomed in the latter half of the 19th century, with a wave of new construction starting in the 1850s. The oldest extant buildings in the district are the Kelsey block at 39-43 N. Main (built in 1854), the Whitesell and McMurtrie block at 109 Portage (built in 1859), and the 1861 block at 18 N. Main. Further construction filled the downtown in the 1860s, 70s, and 80s. These buildings were constructed almost exclusively by local investors, primarily merchants. Seven of the commercial blocks, however, were built by farmer Isaac Null over the period of 1863-1886. In 1884, Null also built his house, located within the district at 105 W. Michigan. The downtown area remains one of the most intact nineteenth and early twentieth-century downtowns in southwest Michigan Description The Downtown Three Rivers Commercial Historic District contains all the structures remaining from Three Rivers' late 19th century commercial center. The district contains 48 structures, including one residence, the former public library, and 46 one- to three-story commercial buildings. The commercial buildings are predominantly Commercial Italianate structures, and are set side by side and directly on the sidewalk. The visually unified and harmonious Late Victorian streetscape gives the district its character. Significant buildings include: *Prutzman Block (22-24 North Main), a lavishly detailed two story, seven bay Italianate structure. *Three blocks (34, 36 and 38 North Main) with mansard roofs constructed in the 1870s. *52-56 North Main, a broad commercial block constructed in 1890. *Riviera Theatre (50 N. Main), a classical theatre with a projecting Art Moderne marquee, constructed in the 1920s in the shell of an 1860s block. *Three Rivers Savings and Loan \\"south building\\" (101 S. Main), a single story buff brick Neo-Classical building trimmed with terra cotta, constructed in 1916. *Public Library (107 N. Main), a 2-1/2 story cross-gable building constructed of rubble stone with shingled gables. It was built in 1904, and designed by A.W. Rush & Co. of Grand Rapids.

Wolcott and A. S. Wolcott; June 14, 1804 ‚Äì March 26, 1844) was an experimental photographer, inventor, maker of medical supplies. With John Johnson, he created the world's first commercial photography portrait studio and patented the first US camera that made photographs.  Early life  Wolcott was born on June 14, 1804, in New London, Connecticut. He was the son of Alexander Wolcott, Sr. and Joanne (Paull) Wolcott.  Photography  Wolcott reflector mirror camera diagram of patent No. 1,582 Wolcott's box camera invention patented May 8, 1840 Wolcott lived in New York City in the 1830s and made dental supplies for a living. He worked in the mechanics of designing instruments that used optics. In 1839 he became an associated with John Johnson, a jeweler and watchmaker's assistant. Together they established the firm 'Wolcott and Johnson' at 52 First Street in New York City. The small business manufactured dental equipment and related supplies. Johnson learned about Daguerre's photographic mechanics on how to make a camera soon after the details had arrived in America on September 20, 1839. On October 6, 1839, he took to Wolcott a copy of the specifications on Daguerre's method of capturing a likeness of a person and storing on a permanent plate that would hold the picture indefinitely. They made a camera that day based on Daguerre's method and started experimenting with it. Wolcott improved on Daguerre's lens camera by making a camera that used a concave mirror to gather more light instead of a simple refractive lens that gathered little light. On October 7, 1839, Wolcott took a photo of Johnson with his daguerreotype reflector camera, creating the first photograph portrait in the world. Wolcott patented the camera on May 8, 1840 (US #1,582). It became known as \\"Wolcott's camera\\" and the \\"mirror camera\\". It was the first US patent in photography. Wolcott and Johnson started using their camera on March 4, 1840, in a business in the Granite Building on Broadway, the Daguerreian Parlor, that made commercial portraits in a studio. It was the world's first commercial daguerreotype gallery, a portrait photography studio. By June, they had opened a branch in Washington D.C., operated by John G. Stevenson. Wolcott's camera used a polished concave mirror to reflect the focused light onto a photosensitive plate less than a half inch square. The pictures were not a negative image of reverse colors, but a correct positive image that did not require reversion of the image. The size of the photo-sensitive plate was eventually increased to just over two square inches that they could make a likeness image, because of their refined mechanical lighting techniques. Wolcott and Johnson continued to improve their photography techniques. Wolcott improved his photosensitive plate and created a chemical \\"accelerator\\", a mix of bromide and chloride. This, along with improved polished silver plates, earned them a second U.S. patent in photography in December 1841, designated #2,391. They also designed outdoor mirrors that provided more light inside the studio for faster higher quality portrait pictures.  Death  Wolcott died on November 10, 1844, at age 39 in Stamford, Connecticut.

It is divided into the two districts 111 Altstadt-Mitte and 112 Altstadt-Ring. The Altstadt-Mitte district was the city's build-up area at the time of its foundation and therefore formed the old city. The district Altstadt-Ring is connected westwards to the railway line and south to the Dreisam. At the end of 2013, about 7,500 people were reported as inhabitants of this district. The district of Altstadt-Mitte was designed according to the pattern of all cities founded by the Z√§hringers. A street cross divides the city into four quarters, the church and the city hall are not located in the same district. The city centre is the Bertoldsbrunnen, where the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe and Salz- and Bertoldstra√üe intersect. The city administration is located in the Old and New city hall. In the late 1990s, however, the head of the administrative region of Freiburg moved its headquarters from the Old City into a new building in the district of Betzenhausen, but the seat of the government president remained in the Basler Hof in the Old City. Neighbouring districts include St√ºhlinger to the west, Neuburg to the north, Oberau to the east and beyond the Dreisam the Wiehre to the south.  Tourist attractions  The Old City is dominated bu the Freiburg Minster at the Minster Square. Also most of the other architectural sight of the city, like the Schwabentor, Martinstor, Augustiner Museum are located in the Old City. The Freiburger B√§chle are at their highest in the Old City and flow from there across the entire city centre. The Schlossberg is directly adjacent to the Old City. From the Schlossbergturm, or Castle Hill Tower, you are about have a circular view of all the city's districts and surrounding areas.  Shopping  Apart from the M√ºnstermarkt on Minster square, most department stores and shops as well as many restaurants are situated in the very heart of the Old City. The majority of mainstream shops can be found on Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe. Since 1979, the city hosts an annual outdoor art & design market called Kunst in der oberen Altstadt (English literally: Art in the upper old city) featuring many artists and designers of a number of different handicrafts.https://www.badische- zeitung.de/kunst-zwischen-schwabentor-und-muenster  Culture and Education  The Old City is the center for cultural life in Freiburg. The Theater Freiburg, the Konzerthaus Freiburg, most of the museums and cinemas, the headquarters of the city's library as well as the Planetarium located at the Freiburg's main train station are all located in the Old City. Alternative culture is also accessible in the Old Town, mainly in the Viertel Im Gr√ºn (named after the street of the same name) between the Konzerthaus and the Dreisam. Two centers are the Sprecht Passage, the Jos Fritz shop, the cafe with the same name, the Harrys Depot, the Grether factory, a former foundry, which includes the Radio Dreyeckland studios, the Rosa Hilfe Freiburg and the Strandcaf√©. The University of Freiburg is also located in the Old City, alongside the faculties of humanities and social sciences as well as the university library.  Transport  The district of Altstadt-Mitte has been a pedestrian zone since the mid-1870s. After the ring road was blocked between the two districts in 2012, the pedestrian zone was partially extended to the district Altstadt-Ring. The boundaries of the built-up old city form multi- lane streets as the main traffic arteries of individual traffic. Car parking is concentrated to several car parking areas on the main traffic axes, whilst in other streets residents have their own car parks. On the two main axes of the Old City, the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe and Berrtoldstra√üe and Salzstra√üe (to the east of Bertoldsbrunnen) are now served by trams. The intersection of the lines at Bertoldsbrunnen is the most important hub of public transport in Freiburg, as the city center is located next to the main railway station on the edge of the Old City and the border to St√ºhlinger.

For five seasons she managed the Washington, D. C. correspondence for a large New York paper, handling a huge workload. She spent a part of the year 1891 in Europe, writing for a number of American periodicals. Among the questions that her editors desired her to investigate were the socialist movement in Germany, the principles of the sub-treasury system in England, and the impetus that the temperance movement received in Germany. Hinman is the author of: Biography of Timothy B. Blackstone (Methodist Book Concern Press, 1917) and The Washington sketch book, a society souvenir (Hartman & Cadick, Printers, 1895). The latter is both a D.C. guidebook and a manual of the city's social life. It is one of the few Washington guidebooks written by a woman. The Washington sketch book was a well-known and received guide, and it was reprinted at least until 1917, when the 6th edition was released. In Washington, D.C., Hinman worked with the National Reform Association and lobbied Congress on behalf of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In 1894 she lobbied Congress for a bill for a Sunday law. She was a Methodist Episcopal revivalist and hymn writer. Some of her works are: \\"I Shall Know Mother's Face in Heaven\\", \\"The Song of Heaven\\", and \\"I Found Him Among the Living\\". Personal life In Keokuk, Iowa, Hinman was a neighbor and friend of Mark Twain's mother, Jane Lampton Clemens, who was living with her other son, Orion Clemens, the first and only Secretary of Nevada Territory. Hinman lived with her mother and sister Ella at 27 Morgan Street. She spent summers in Ocean Grove, New Jersey and Asbury Park, New Jersey.

The party was formed to contest the 1864 presidential election and it was made up largely of disaffected Radical Republicans who felt that President Abraham Lincoln was too moderate on the issues of slavery and racial equality. John C. Fr√©mont was nominated as the party's presidential candidate, with John Cochrane as his running mate. However, their campaign failed to gain momentum and not wanting to act as a spoiler against Lincoln, they withdrew from the race in September. History =Cleveland convention= The new party convened in Chapin's Hall in Cleveland, Ohio on at the end of May 1864, one week before the Republican convention. Different estimates were given on the number of attendees, ranging from 200 to 2,000.William Ganson Rose (1990). Cleveland: The Making of a City. Kent State University Press. p. 324 Often the number given depended on the political leanings of those making the estimate.Ganson Rose (1990). p. 324.

Princeton University Press. P. 270. Abolitionist Wendell Phillips did not attend in person, but wrote a letter on behalf of the new organization which was read out. In it, he criticized Lincoln's model of reconstruction, citing the experience of Louisiana following its recapture by Union forces and stated that Lincoln's model \\"makes the freedom of the negro a sham, and perpetuates Slavery under a softer name\\".McPherson (1964), pp. 269-70. The platform adopted at Cleveland called for the continuation of the war without compromise, a Constitutional amendment banning slavery and authorizing equal rights, confiscation of rebel property, control of post-war reconstruction by Congress and enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine. The platform also called for a one-term Presidency as well as other implicit calls for civil service reform. To appeal to Democrats, the platform adopted emphasized the protection of the rights of free speech, a free press and the writ of habeas corpus as the Democrats had criticized Lincoln on these issues.Info at elections.harpweek.com Historian James M. McPherson has argued that because of the party wishing to appeal to Democrats, it refused to take on specific calls for black suffrage and land grants for freed slaves that it might otherwise have explicitly endorsed.McPherson (1964), p. 270. =Campaign= Fr√©mont and Cochrane campaign poster Many of the new party's supporters did not necessarily want it to stand in the election. Rather, the hope was that the formation of a new party would cause Lincoln not to gain the Republican nomination.McPherson (1964), p. 270. Although this did not occur, Fr√©mont maintained over the course of his campaign that he would drop out if Lincoln did likewise, in favor of a candidate whose platform more closely matched the ideals of the Radical Republicans.McPherson (1964), p. 281. Fr√©mont gained the support of a number of prominent abolitionists. However, the majority of Radical Republicans continued to support Lincoln as it was felt that Fr√©mont could not win and that supporting him would split the abolitionist vote in favor of the Democrat candidate George McClellan.Adam I. P. Smith (2006). No Party Now: Politics in the Civil War North. Oxford University Press. P. 115. Additionally, many were less than enthusiastic about the party platform with its compromises aiming to attract Democrats.McPherson (1964), p. 273. Fr√©mont continued these overtures during his campaign.McPherson (1964), p. 273. As the campaign failed to gain momentum, many abolitionists urged Fr√©mont to withdraw his nomination. No major newspaper supported Fr√©mont.Smith (2006), p. 115. However, some Democrat supporting newspapers such as the New York World did talk up Fr√©mont's credentials in order to disunite Republicans.McPherson (1964), p. 274.

In a letter to The New York Times, Fr√©mont wrote that it had become increasingly clear that the Democrats could not be trusted on the issues of union or abolition.

It was founded by Yannis Garedakis, owner and founder of the local newspaper Haniotika Nea, and his wife Eleni Garedakis. The museum started as a small private collection next to the newspaper‚Äôs printing facilities and first opened its doors to the public in 2005. A few years later, in 2012, a new wing was added, presenting various techniques related to typography. In 2015 another hall was inaugurated, along with the museum shop and a small coffee shop. At the last hall, through selected rare books, newspapers, engravings and lithographs from the 16th‚Äì19th centuries, visitors have the opportunity to see and learn more about the turbulent history of Crete. Through the interactive tour, visitors come to understand the course of typography from the Middle Ages up to today. Œëll visitors are encouraged to print at printing presses of the 19th century, while videos explain how many of the techniques in the exhibits operate. Alongside, the museum organises and hosts cultural events all year long, such as conferences, book presentations, theatrical plays, musical events, and an international poster contest about typography. Since 2012 the Typography Museum has been a member of the Association of European Printing Museums (AEPM) and in 2017 it hosted the Annual General Meeting and Conference of the Association. In 2016 the Museum of Typography was nominated for the European Museum of the Year Award.European Museum of the Year Award 2016 The collections The main hall of the museum contains two elaborate cast-iron printing presses of the beginning of the 19th century; a copy of Gutenberg‚Äôs printing press; foot-operated Victoria-type printing presses from Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Greece; and smaller, hand-operated Boston-type printing presses. There are typesetting benches from Gutenberg¬¥s time to the beginning of the 20th century, with two examples of linotype and monotype typesetting machines. Printing techniques such as lithography, offset, wood engraving, copper engraving and silk screen printing are presented in detail in specially designed showcases; another special exhibit is the presentation of the Braille writing method for the blind, a donation by the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece organization. Large flatbed printing presses of the 19th century dominate the area of the new wing and the amphitheatre, while another one, dating from the middle of the 20th century, is located in the main hall. Two exhibitions showing the history of writing and the evolution of typography, through the artistic view of the graphic designer and printer Antonis Papantonopoulos, are housed in the semi-floor and the ground floor of the new wing. Traditional workshops for lithography, silk screen, bookbinding and stamp making are also in the new wing, as are more modern exhibits presenting the development of graphic arts. Rare editions from the 16th century onwards ‚Äì especially from Venice ‚Äì Greek and foreign newspapers from the early 19th century, maps, lithographs, woodcuts and etchings are presented in the last hall of the museum, leaving visitors an aftertaste that connects typography with the turbulent history of Crete. The majority of these exhibits were donated by the local collector Kostas Tzortzakis. More rare books and periodicals, as well as precious Greek and foreign books about typography, printing, the Press and graphic arts can be found in the museum library, along with a collection of old typewriters and polygraphs. All the exhibits have explanatory texts in English and in Greek regarding their use, origin and date of manufacture or operation. Education Every year, more than 5,000 students of primary and secondary schools, universities and colleges from all over Greece visit the museum ‚Äì especially those studying such subjects as art and design, graphic arts, history, and typography.

It was established in Melbourne, Australia in 1895/1896 and is one of the oldest active medical organisations in the world. The aim of the society was to set a benchmark in women‚Äôs health around Victoria, and to advance the professional development of medical women, through education, research, and the improvement of professional opportunities. The state-run society became affiliated with the national body, Australian Federation of Medical Women (since 1927), and thereby the Medical Women‚Äôs International Association.  History  Dr Constance Stone, the first woman to practice medicine in Australia, founded the Victorian Medical Women‚Äôs Society in 1895/96. It was founded with the aim to further the professional development of medical women by education, research and improvement of professional opportunities. Soon after its foundation, its aims evolved to promote and advocate the health and welfare of all Australians, particularly women and children. = Queen Victoria Hospital = The founders of the Victorian Medical Women's Society established The Victoria Hospital - one of the first hospitals worldwide to be run by women, for women. This clinic was run from the hall of The Welsh Church, at 320 La Trobe Street, Melbourne, where Constance Stone's husband Dr/Reverend Egryn Jones presided. Here, the founders of the society volunteered their expertise and treated the poorest of women at no cost. Their services were in high demand with over two thousand patients presenting to the clinic in its first three months of opening. To expand their services the society established the Queen‚Äôs Shilling Fund, where every woman in the state of Victoria was asked to donate a shilling to fund a new hospital. This campaign, largely arranged by suffragist Annette 'Annie' Bear-Crawford, was very successful and The Queen Victoria Hospital was born at Mint Place a year later. In 1946 it was relocated to a much larger premises at the site of the former Melbourne General Hospital on Lonsdale Street (now The Queen Victoria Village). By 1951 it was the biggest women's hospital in the British Commonwealth. In 1986 the hospital became part of the Monash Medical Centre as part of moves to decentralise hospital services. = First World War = At the time of the onset of the First World War, many Australian women doctors wanted to support the war effort by providing their much-needed skills in assisting the sick and wounded. However, as women, they were not permitted enlistment in both the Australian or Royal Army Medical Corps. Six members of the Victorian Medical Women's Society sought alternative means to provide their services, through military services established by medical women overseas. These notable women, including Mary de Garis, Helen Sexton, and Vera Scantlebury are honoured with a memorial plaque which was placed at The Welsh Church in 2016.

At least one of the ships he took belonged to John Trimingham, among Bermuda's wealthiest citizens. In April 1700 Ferdinando had the captains of two captured ships aboard his own.

When a Moroccan newsmagazine, Le Journal hebdomadaire (December 9, 2005), dared expose the fact that the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Institute was being paid to tar and feather Polisario, thus began the regime's successful five-year campaign to drive one of the few independent media voices out of existence. Morocco even enlisted its academic voices to aid in the terrorization of the Western Sahara peace process by linking Al-Qaeda to Polisario. \\" Le Journal Hebdomadaire, a leading Moroccan independent weekly, published an article critical of the first ESISC report and noted that it reflected the official views of the Moroccan government. Moniquet then sued the newspaper in a Moroccan court, which ordered Le Journal Hebdomadaire to pay him 360,000 dollars.

It is part of the municipal unit of Apollonioi.  Location, elevation  Evgiros is situated on a hill in the south of Lefkada, at an elevation of 820 feet (250 meters). The village has a beautiful view of the Afales Bay in Ithaca and the northern part of Cephalonia, in particular Fiskardo. Evgiros enjoys a nice view of the Lefkas Lighthouse, with the cape Doukato, famous for being the spot from where the classic Greek female poet Sappho dared her suitors to try and soar if they truly loved her, and from there she is also said to have taken her life, by jumping on the white rocks below.  History  The first settlements in Evgiros are said to be from the Middle Ages. Evgiros used to be one of the main villages on the island, with a population of more than 900 as late as 1950. The village was the center of its own municipality, with Heracles' head as its symbol. The local school had more than 80 pupils. The economy was based on olive and grapes crops, with the village operating 8 oil mills. Goats and sheep were bred for cheese, a staple of the local diet. Two large areas were available for the crops and the herds, the \\"Campo\\" below the village, and the \\"Voun√¨\\" (dialect: small mountain) above it. Later on the families from Evgiros gave origin to the settlement of Syvota. Now a flourishing tourist resort, Syvota was established as a harbor for the fishermen, with a few wooden huts. In the second half of the 20th Century, challenging economic conditions brought along the Greek diaspora, with Evgiros being hit harshly: many of the locals left for Athens, but more emigrated to Australia, Canada, Germany or the United States.  World War II  Evgiros was occupied by the Italians in 1941, and later, after the Armistice of Cassibile, by the Germans. Some of the former invading Italians were aided and hidden by villagers to protect them from the Germans, as Lefkas had its own small version of the Cephalonia Massacre. Evgiros villagers were involved in the Resistance, with the Germans burning many houses as a reprisal.  Population  Current population in Evgiros is around 30 people year round. In the summer and the Holidays many of the people who left come back, and the village goes back in time, hosting some 200 people.

History  = The Silk Industry in Zurich = As early as 1237, raw silk was documented to be brought to Zurich from Como via Walenstadt. At that time, shipments were transported in primitive vehicles on poorly paved roads, narrow bridle paths, and dangerously labile, unstable footbridges. Back then, transporting silk was much more laborious and hazardous than it is today. To reach Chur and adjacently Walenstadt, traders were forced to pass the Septimer Pass and the old imperial road. From there, the goods were transported to Zurich by boat. Upon arrival, the silk was unloaded near the Helmhaus Bridge and sold in a store near the Fraum√ºnster. = Silk Drying = The drying ovens of the \\"Seidentrocknungsanstalt Z√ºrich\\" around 1918 In order to determine the curb weight of silk, it must be completely dry. However, this process is heavily influenced by the atmospheric humidity, since the material absorbs moisture from the air and thereby increases in weight This property of raw silk makes it difficult to accurately determine its weight, which created the need for independent ‚Äúweighing institutes‚Äù. These institutes were established to dry all traders‚Äô silk according to a standardized method and thereby ensure a fair silk trade. Per definition, a silk conditioning institute is ‚Äúa neutral authority whose test results are recognized as binding by both contractual parties.\\" The first silk conditioning institute opened on April 8, 1724 in Turin. It would remain the only institution of its kind until Jean-Louis Rast- Maupas opened a similar institution with improved procedures in Lyon in 1779. During the French Revolution, Rast-Maupas's ‚ÄúCondition‚Äù was closed for nearly two years. During this time, three similar institutes opened in Lyon, setting off a fierce competition. In 1805, Napoleon granted the Lyon Chamber of Commerce the exclusive right to dry silk, resulting in the establishment of a state institution in 1814. Following the establishment of institutions in Turin, Lyon, and Milan, others quickly followed in Elberfeld, Krefeld, Saint- √âtienne, Vienna, Zurich, and, finally, in New York, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. = Founding = The silk industry experienced a considerable boom around 1846. It became obvious that it would be disadvantageous to remain dependent on foreign silk conditioning institutions, a ‚Äúprovisional committee‚Äù decided to establish a silk drying institute in Zurich. On September 22, 1846, the constitutive assembly approved the statutes. Nearly 50 silk experts gathered in the ‚ÄúZunfthaus zur Zimmerl√§uten‚Äù to elect a board of directors for the newly founded institute. Colonel Heinrich von Muralt-Stockar was elected Chairman of the Board, and Lord Schwarzenbach-Imhof was appointed as director. Three days later the board met for the first time, and operations began on June 1, 1847. At that time, they did not yet have any practical experience in silk drying. Three individuals were primarily responsible for the founding of the Silk Drying Institute in Zurich. They became aware of silk drying while travelling abroad and wanted to establish the practice in Switzerland in order to make the local silk trade less dependent on foreign entities. All three were politically active and well known throughout the city. Colonel Heinrich von Muralt-Stockar served as Chairman of the Board for 14 consecutive years, he was the son of Hans Conrad von Muralt, the former mayor of Zurich. At the age of 27, he took over his father's silk business ‚ÄúHeinrich de Daniel Muralt‚Äù and served as president of Zurich's ‚ÄúBaukollegium‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúDampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft‚Äù. Cavalry Captain Conrad B√ºrkli, a senior commander of the fire brigade, was a close friend of von Muralt's. He had been the proprietor of the Johann Georg B√ºrkli silk trading company since 1811, as well as a member of the city council. Johann Heinrich (Henry) Bodmer- Pestalozzi was a member of the Bodmer zur Arch family and owner of the family's eponymous silk production company. The company was among the first in Switzerland to produce silk gauze. = Facilities = The newly constructed headquarters in April 1932 at the Gotthardstrasse 61, Z√ºrich Between 1846 and 1863, the Silk Drying Institute resided in the ‚Äú√Ñusseren Tiefenhof‚Äù, where the headquarters of the Zurich Cantonal Bank are located at present. The facility, located in the center of Zurich, covered roughly 5,525 square feet. On October 1, 1849, a new branch was opened in Basel, which would later detach itself organizationally and financially from its parent company in 1872. Due to the company's rapid growth and an acute need for additional space, a new facility was acquired in 1861: the ‚Äúweissen B√§ren,‚Äù located on the corner of B√§rengasse and Talstrasse. The company officially moved to the new facility in 1863, after two years of renovations and furnishing. The facility remained in use until 1932, when it was replaced by the company's present-day headquarters in Zurich's Enge district, which officially opened on April 14, 1932. Although an expansion of the company's operational space had been in discussion since as early as 1889, the implementation was delayed, due to World War I. = The Zurich Silk Industry in Its Prime = In the second half of the 19th century, free trade policies and technological advances such as the telephone and the telegraph, introduced a period of prosperity for the silk trade. The Gotthard railway connection, completed in 1882, and the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 made international trade significantly easier. On account of its constant improvements to the silk drying procedure and improved logistics and storage, Zurich became the center of the international silk trade. = The War and Post-War Eras = Zurich retained this status during World War I despite the difficult conditions, which caused interruptions and declines in sales. Many banks and other businesses closed following the outbreak of war. This resulted in a shortage of liquid funds, which soon impacted the silk trade. The home countries of the institutions in Milan, Turin, Lyon, Krefeld, and later Tokyo and New York, had entered the war. This favored the silk industry in Zurich tremendously, hence it achieved record sales between 1915 and 1917. = World War II = While the transition from a peacetime economy to a wartime economy posed fewer issues in World War II than it did in World War I, the war years were even tougher for the silk trade. As a national economy, Switzerland was largely cut off from foreign markets. While the silk trade was exempt from rationing measures, it was subordinated to the Swiss Textile Syndicate along with all other branches of the textile industry. The export guarantee issued by the Swiss Federal Council eased the situation for exports only. Starting in 1944, silk experienced a certain upswing due to the temporary shortage of wool and cotton. Following the war, the silk business began to flourish once again. Large supplies of Italian silk were exported to Switzerland, which stimulated the local economy.  Present  = Decline of the Swiss Silk Industry = The Testex AG's headquarters at present Following the development of synthetic fibers, particularly after World War II, the Swiss silk industry began processing less and less real silk. As a result, the demand for traditional silk drying methods declined significantly. In 1970, the company responded to the shifting market conditions by focussing on textile testing and changing its name to Testex AG. This laid the foundation for a new reorganization to a modern testing institute. In 1993, Testex joined the Oeko-Tex Association and began conducting human ecological tests on textiles. = Testex Today = Today, little remains of the silk drying institute. The boom eras of Zurich's silk industry are a thing of the past, and the Swiss textile industry has long been in decline. The \\"Seidentrocknungsanstalt\\", however, has managed to avoid a similar fate.

The cave is one of the most famous cavities in the Gorizia Karst. Anyway, due to its dangerous pit opening, entry is allowed only to expert cavers with the necessary equipment for single-rope descend. Morphology Abisso Bonetti is one of the biggest and most well-known cavities in the Gorizia Karst. It opens above sea level, on a small plateau north of Jamiano (Doberd√≤ del Lago), near Slovenian border. Overall, it is long and deep. Peculiarity of the cavity is its impressive opening, a deep, for wide abyss, that's an open pit in direct connection with the external environment. The cave has another entrance, that's a partially artificial gallery connected with the pit. During World War I, Austro-Hungarian Army built a shelter in the gallery. The bottom part of the open pit contains a rubble slope where detritus, plant materials and animal carrions, fallen down from the external environment, are collected. The innermost part of the cave is made up of an underground gallery after that, passing through a tight passage, a big hall is reached. The hall contains collapsed bedrocks and cave formations, including a column that seems like holding up the weight of the ceiling. Abisso Bonetti shows a climatic peculiarity. The innermost part of the cave has a stable temperature (, that's the annual mean temperature in the place where the cave opens), a typical feature of cavities. In the bottom part of the open pit, the temperature varies between in summer and in winter. This part of the cave can be considered a cold trap. History During World War I, between 1916 and 1917, Austro-Hungarian Army used the cave as a shelter and as a field hospital, and adapted it through opening a new entrance in the gallery next to the pit. Because of the present of a number of pigeons, Austro-Hungarians called the cave Taubenloch H√∂hle or Taubenschlucht (\\"Pigeons Hole\\"). The same name (Slovene: Golobinka) was also used by Slovenian people living in the area. In the spring of 1917, Italian Army occupied the whole area and used the cave as a shelter. In 1946, the Rastrellatori (\\"bomb disposal\\") unit extracted a number of explosive remnants of war from the cave. However, some remnants of World War I can be found in the cave yet. In addition to the military use, the cave has drawn speleologists' attention. The first survey of the cavity was realised by Colonel Italo Garibotti (SAG) in January 1923. The survey was reviewed by Ugo Stocker (Gruppo Speleologico Monfalconese) on 16 June 1968. During last decades, many speleology schools have used the cave in their first-level courses. Since the 80ths, scientist have carried out a number of botanical, zoological and geological studies and researches in the cave. The fauna Abisso Bonetti represents one of the four localities where the ground beetle Typhlotrechus bilimeki tergestinus, a troglobious, depigmented and anophthalmic predator species, can be observed. Other species hosted in the cave are cave dwelling species typical of the Karst area. Troglobites include the spider Mesostalita nocturna, the woodlouses Alpioniscus strasseri and Androniscus stygius, and the round fungus beetle Bathysciotes khevenhulleri tergestinus. Troglophiles include the millipede Brachydesmus subterraneus, two centipede lithobid species, the cave cricket Troglophilus neglectus, the moth Triphosa dubitata, the fly Limonia nubeculosa and an unidentified phorid fly species, the ground beetle Laemostenus cavicola, and the rove beetles Atheta spelaea e Quedius mesomelinus. In addition, bats (in particular the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and birds (e.g. some specimen of tawny owl) use the first part of the cavity as a refuge. The bottom part of the open pit hosts a number of trogloxene insects, spiders, amphibians and reptiles. In summer, these animals are attracted by low temperature and humidity coming from the pit and fall down. However, if they survive the fall, they stay trapped and cannot return to the external environment. The flora In general, the lack of sunlight in caves prevents photosynthesis and plant growth. However, the particular morphology of Abisso Bonetti (a deep pit with a large opening) lets a certain amount of light penetrate the pit, allowing the growth of some plant species. Vegetation in Abisso Bonetti can be divided in four vegetational zones, that are from the top (extern) to the bottom (intern) of the pit: * liminal zone (): this well-lighted zone hosts trees and herbs growing in the external environment (typical plants of Seslerio- Ostryetum), and some fern species (genera Asplenium and Polypodium) * sub- liminal zone (): this zone hosts phanerogames (common hazel, balm-leaved archangel, wall lettuce, cyclamen, drooping bittercress), ferns (maidenhair spleenwort and hart's-tongue), mosses (especially Thamnobryium alopecurum) and the first green algae colonies * sub-dark zone (): this zone, where light is strongly reduced, hosts mosses, hepatics and some remaining ferns (maidenhair spleenwort) * dark zone (): only bacteria and green algae colonies can survive here, where light is absent but humidity is high; moreover, molds and fungi (non-photosynthetic organisms) grow on decomposing substances  Geology  In the 90ths, two minerals was found for the first time in an Italian cave. These are crandallite and octacalcium phosphate (OCP).

Life Petri was born in Cologne and received his early education both there and in Berlin. He began his university studies in 1928, taking in Economics, History and Philosophy, as well as coursework on Prehistory and Physical Anthropology, with studies that took him also to Rome, and Vienna where he studied under Wilhelm Schmidt, Wilhelm Koppers and Robert von Heine-Geldern were among his teachers there. In this early phase Petri was particularly taken by Meso-American cultures, studying under the direction of Fritz R√∂ck, and learnt Nahuatl. He completed his Phd with a thesis on currencies in the South Pacific (Geldformen der S√ºdsee ). His first professional appointment was in Vienna, where he was curator at both the Museum of Ethnology and the Museum of Natural History In 1935 he moved to Frankfurt am Main to take up a position with the Forschungsinstitut f√ºr Kulturmorphologie. Frankfurt provided him with the opportunity to pursue research on Oceania and Australia at the Museum of World Cultures and, in 1938-1939, he embarked on his first piece of ethnographical fieldwork, which took him the Kimberley region of Western Australia. There he worked in particular with the Worrorra, Ngarinjin and other tribes of the Dampier Archipelago. On his return, Petri was drafted into the Wehrmacht and served as a radio-operator in France, Greece, North Africa and Italy. At war's end, he was taken prisoner and detained for several months in an American camp for POWs. On his release, he resumed his former job at the Frobenius Institute, under Adolf Ellegard Jensen, lecturing in anthropology. After a further stint of fieldwork in Australia in 1953-1954. he was appointed to a full professorship in 1956, and department chair of the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Cologne two years later.

Taft and great-grandsons of former United States President William Howard Taft. Their father Horace Dwight Taft worked as dean of Yale College. After graduating from the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut in 1968, Taft graduated in 1972 from Yale University summa cum laude. By 1977, after working as a copy boy with the New York Times, Taft furthered his career as a newspaper reporter in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he spent several years \\"covering the rebuilding of Lowell.\\" Developing an interest in urban redevelopment and the financing of community projects, he then attended graduate school at Yale University in New Haven to learn about finance.

With Piper Jaffray, he spent ten years helping a variety of clients, including governments and finance projects for public use. The city of St. Paul, Minnesota was among his clients, and Taft spent two years working for the Mayor of St. Paul as an assistant. After serving as managing director at Piper Jaffray, he went on to become president, CEO, and chairman of Voyageur Asset Management, the asset-management business of Dougherty Financial Group. During that time, Taft also served as a director of Segall, Bryant and Hamill and The Clifton Group.

Taft was appointed to a management role at RBC, becoming head of asset management and products for RBC‚Äôs United States and international division. Returning to Minneapolis, Taft became CEO of RBC's US retail brokerage arm, RBC Wealth Management US, in September 2005. Under Taft, RBC Wealth Management avoided major financial difficulties in the 2008 financial crisis, and its assets under management increased 60% between 2008 and 2011, to $220 billion. In an effort to allow the unit's financial advisors to dedicate more time to clients, between 2008 and 2011 Taft \\"boosted RBC's annual technology spending by 50%,\\" and encouraged advisors to work in teams. =Acquisitions and DelaneyTaft= After advocating for the addition of banking and lending to RBC's capabilities in the United States, in November 2015 he helped facilitate RBC's acquisition of City National Bank for $5.4 billion. The merger added \\"banking and lending capabilities to the firm‚Äôs advisor force.\\" After a number of other acquisitions as well, by early 2016 Taft's unit of 1,900 financial advisors was overseeing $273 billion of assets in 41 states.

However, in early 2016, Wealth Management reported that Taft had been fighting against attempts to \\"apply the... fiduciary standard to brokers\\" by the US Department of Labor (DOL), with Taft arguing that the DOL's version of the standard would not work for the brokerage industry. Taft advocated that such a standard should instead by written by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to their experience with financial markets.

The majority of the lyrics belong to the genre of Spruchdichtung and, with 91 melodies, the manuscript is the single most important source for the music of this genre. It is currently held in the Thuringian Universit√§ts- und Landesbibliothek, Jena, with the shelf-mark Ms. El. f. 101. In Minnesang scholarship it is referred to as Manuscript J. A further fragment, consisting of a single sheet, is in the in Dillingen (XV Fragm. 19). Description The manuscript comprises 133 (of an original 154) folios and contains collections of lyrics by 31 named poets, along with an anonymous religious song (a Leich), and the text of the Wartburgkrieg (\\"The song-contest at the Wartburg\\"). The quality of the manuscript is exceptional: > The unusual size of the manuscript, 56 by 41 cm, the outstanding quality of > the parchment, the careful, almost monumental execution of the penmanship in > both text and music suggest an aristocratic patron who wished to own a song > collection with melodies in a luxurious edition. Of the melodies, Bernoulli notes, \\"On the whole we cannot imagine a more clearly written example of a document using square notation.\\" For these reasons, it seems likely that the manuscript was commissioned for display (or possibly as a gift) rather than for use in musical performance. History The manuscript was compiled in about 1330 in Central Germany, possibly Thuringia for an unknown high-status patron, though it has been suggested it was for Frederick the Serious, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, or Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg. By 1540 it was located in Wittenberg, where it was bound, and in 1549 was transferred as part of the Wittenberg Bibliotheca Electoralis (\\"Elector's library\\") to the Collegium Jenense in Jena, which later became the University of Jena. The Dillingen fragment is a single sheet, half of a folio that was removed from J (between the current folios 132 and 133) sometime before the latter was bound in 1541. It was used as a binding for a collection of religious tracts and was first discovered in 1917.

The church remains an active parish church within the Mission Area of Denbigh. Architecture and description The Tree of Jesse Window The church is constructed of limestone rubble with sandstone dressings and slate roofs. It has a double nave, a South chamber and a four-storey tower. The architectural historian Edward Hubbard notes the style as Perpendicular, with the possible exception of the tower door. The interior contains a \\"wonderfully complete\\" Tree of Jesse window, described by Cadw as \\"the apogee of the early Tudor North Wales school of glazing\\". The window, showing Jesus's descent from Jesse, has been called \\"the finest Glass window in all Wales, exceeded by few in England\\". The church also contains a number of significant monuments to local grandees including those of Watkin Edwards Wynne and Maurice Jones, the latter \\"large and Baroque, (a) reclining bewigged effigy\\". There is also a rare carved pelican, dated 1792, shown feeding its young with its blood.

It is the only surviving residence of renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith, who resided there between 1778 and 1790. Situated close to the Scottish Parliament, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it‚Äôs at the heart of Scottish and intellectual history. During his time living at Panmure House, Smith would continue to study and write, producing four new editions of his magnum opus The Wealth of Nations between 1778 and 1789. He was still at work on the final edition of his 1759 master work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, when he died in Panmure House in 1790 and is buried in the nearby Canongate Kirkyard. Now an A listed building, Panmure House is the last and only surviving Smith residence, which was bought by Edinburgh Business School, the business school of Heriot-Watt University in 2008; the School commissioned the restoration of Panmure House into a centre of learning and debate provide a resource for students, businesses and the local community. Work began on the restoration of Panmure House in July 2016 and was completed in mid-2018, ahead of the official opening by former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, in November 2018.  Restoration  Panmure House was in a state of disrepair when it was purchased due to several years of neglect. The restoration took several years and was expertly executed. Restoration work was carried out on the exterior and interior of the House. The exterior work included rebuilding the tall chimney stacks, re-slating the roofs, repairing the stone walls and renewing the windows. The renovations also included digging out the original basement to create a contemporary extension to the building which now houses a modern Interpretation Suite where visitors can learn more about the House, Smith, and the Scottish Enlightenment before continuing into the rest of the house. Archaeological investigations carried out by local archaeologists, Addyman Archaeology, below the building uncovered a well and several medieval kilns. Work inside the house concentrated on reconstructing interiors typical of the late 1700s, using materials and techniques that were likely used in Smith‚Äôs time. The interiors are striking and feature North American tulipwood timber panelling. A new stone staircase was added made out from Clasach stone and original stone hewn from 17th-century Lothian quarries which would have been hauled by horse and cart to the capital. The stone used throughout the House is bright and golden, encased in lime mortar and the sand was brought in from pits near Leslie in Fife. The interior reflects a sophisticated blend between modern and period which has created a unique space consisting of a modern building with steelwork, concrete, digital screens and cabling all exquisitely concealed behind the paneling, architraves and skirtings. The renovation also added new stone fireplaces, oak floors and lime plasterwork. The original roof timbers have been preserved in the attic and carry the original joiners' marks on them, numbering the trusses in Roman numerals.  Notable visitors  Panmure House in the late 1700s was not only a place of academic study, it was alive with discourse and debate. Key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were regular visitors; James Hutton, founder of modern geology, Joseph Black, founding father of chemistry, Robert Adam, the neoclassical architect, David Hume, Scottish philosopher, William Robertson, Edinburgh University principal and historian, Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric, Samual Rogers, English poet and Dugald Stewart, philosopher and mathematician, were some of the distinguished names to be welcomed here.

Kerbogha's goal was to reclaim Antioch from the Crusaders and affirm his position as a regional power.  The conflict begins  As the starving and outnumbered Crusaders emerged from the gates of the city and divided into six regiments, Kerbogha's commander, Watthab ibn Mahmud, urged him to immediately strike their advancing line. However, Kerbogha was concerned a preemptive strike might only destroy the Crusader's front line and may also significantly weaken his own forces disproportionately. However, as the Franks continued to advance against the Turks, Kerbogha began to grasp the severity of the situation (he previously underestimated the size of the Crusading army), and attempted to establish an embassy between him and the Crusaders in order to broker a truce. However, it was too late for him, and the leaders of the Crusade ignored his emissary.  Battle manoeuvres  Kerbogha, now backed against a corner by the advancing Franks, opted to adopt a more traditional Turkish battle tactic. He would attempt to back his army up slightly in order to drag the Franks into unsteady land, while continuously pelting the line with horse archers, meanwhile making attempts to outflank the Franks. However, Bohemond was ready for this, and he created a seventh division of Crusaders led by Rainauld of Toul to hold off the attack. Soon, many Emirs began to desert Kerbogha. Many of the Crusaders were also encouraged by the presumed visions of St. George, St. Mercurius, and Saint Demetrius among their ranks. Finally, Duqaq of Damascus deserted, spreading panic among the ranks of the Turks. Soqman the Ortoqid and the Emir of Homs, Janah ad-Daula, were the last loyal to Kerbogha, but they too soon deserted after realizing the battle was lost. The whole Turkish army was now in complete disarray, all fleeing in different directions; the Crusaders chased them as far as the Iron Bridge, slaying many of them. Kerbogha would go on to return to Mosul, defeated and stripped of his prestige.

It was written between 499 and 456BC, and appears to have featured Jason and the Argonauts arriving on the island of Lemnos and being initiated into the mystery cult of the Kabeiroi. The title refers to the play's chorus, who were local chthonic deities associated with mystery religion and often considered to be sons or grandsons of Hephaistos. Lemnos was the location for a cult of the Kabeiroi from the sixth century BC onwards, and archaeological excavations confirm that initiation rites occurred there. In 2017 the fragments were reimagined by Punchdrunk as a six-hour durational performance which took place on the streets of London for just two audience members at a time.Kabeiroi  The Tetralogy  The play was part of one of only eleven known Aeschylean tetralogies, or instances where we can confidently identify all the plays that premiered together. It appeared as part of a lost tetralogy containing Aeschylus' Lemnian Women, Hypsipyle, and The Argo (also known as Oarsman). The scarcity of evidence makes reconstructing the plot of the tetralogy difficult; however, it seems most likely that Lemnian Women dramatised the Lemnian women's murder of their male relatives, The Kabeiroi involved the Argonauts arriving on Lemnos, being initiated into the mystery cult of the Kabeiroi, and procreating with the women, and that Hypsipyle, named after the Queen of Lemnos and mother of two children to Jason, dealt with the revelation of the homicides to the Argonauts and their consequent evacuation of the island.  Fragments  Three fragments survive from The Kabeiroi. The first survives as a quotation in Athenaeus 9.373d, and reads 'But I do not treat you as an omen of my journey'. A second fragment is quoted in Plutarch (Moralia 632f-633a) and threatens to make 'the house scarce with respect to vinegar', while a final fragment reads 'That there shall never be a dearth of jars, either of wine or of water, in wealthy home'.  Other Evidence  A scholia to Pindar's Pythian 4 reveals that the play contained a catalogue of the Argonauts. Athenaeus 10.428 also records that the play was the first instance in which an individual appeared drunk in a tragedy. Burkert notes that wine vessels are the only characteristic group of finds from the Kabeiroi sanctuary on Lemnos; the emphasis of drunkenness in Athenaeus and wine in the fragments may emphasise the significance of wine in the initiation rituals associated with the Kabeiroi cult.

The LP range proved a strong seller, with an increase of German sales for Mercedes- Benz in the heavy truck segment of 153 per cent between 1965 and 1973.Heide, p. 13 Light duty The light duty cabin, first introduced in 1965, was used for trucks with GVWs ranging from . These LPs can most easily be distinguished by their low-line grilles, with headlights mounted inside. As with all of the Cubic cabs, they did not have a tilting cabin, both to save costs and to make it more safe in crashes. A series hatches and doors were to provide access, but the trucks were complicated to service. Only a short daycab was on offer, although independent bodybuilders were at hand to provide any other layouts. The first version introduced was the LP 608, equipped with the OM 314 diesel engine. There was also a version, as well as ones. In 1969 nine-tonners appeared, fitted with the six-cylinder OM 352 engine with either . The LP 608 was also the first truck to leave the production line in Daimler-Benz newly constructed plant in W√∂rth. In 1977 the light range was thoroughly modernized, with a smoothed out cabin and a new grille.Heide, p. 14 The headlights were now mounted below the body, in the front bumper. A version with an air-sprung rear axle was also added. The cabin remained fixed, in a segment where most competitors had moved on to tilting cabs. New ten and eleven tonne models were added, while the output of the smallest OM 314 engine crept up to . The light portion of the range outlived its heavier brethren, remaining in production until 1984. Medium duty Mercedes-Benz LP 1217 The medium-duty models in the range had GVWs between . A different door arrangement was shared with the heaviest part of the range, while the grille was taller. The headlamps were mounted in the lower half of the grille. Introduced in 1965, it was fully replaced by the Mercedes-Benz NG in 1976. In 1965 a longer cabin with room for two berths was also introduced.Heide, p. 15 The non-tilting cabin required a large number of hatches and doors for access to the mechanical parts, which earned the model the less than flattering nickname \\"Advent Calendar.\\" The lighter models received the 5675 cc six-cylinder OM 352 engine with either , while the heavier ones received the 7980 cc OM 327 with . When the heavier range was facelifted in 1970, the middleweights received mechanical upgrades and new weight ratings, but the appearance remained mostly the same. Some more powerful engines were also introduced, as in the LP 1519's 8720 cc OM 360 with . Heavy duty The heavy-duty models were the first to be introduced, in late 1963. They have GVWs between . Their cabin is similar to that of the later middleweight trucks, although the oval headlamps were mounted in the bumper beneath the body. They were fairly spartanly equipped, in praticular the absence of a suspended seat. Mercedes-Benz countered with a suspended cabin, but this was often not enough to provide driver comfort in practice.Heide, p. 10 Much of the technology was adapted from the preceding L/LP series, including the OM 326 diesel straight-six.Heide, p. 11 In 1964 this was replaced with the all-new OM 346 direct injection diesel, an engine that ran smoother and was more durable (after some early problems). Outputs soon crept up to and then to to meet new regulations which took effect on 1 May 1965. An overall weight of for tractor-trailers coupled with the minimum 6 PS/tonne (max 373 lb/hp) made this necessary. From 1 January 1972, the minimum power requirement increased to 8 PS/tonne (max 280 lb/hp). Mercedes-Benz responded with a new generation of diesel engines in a V-layout. These, however, required a tilting cabin and thus the heavy trucks were finally thus equipped. A V10 OM 403 was enough for the heaviest loads, while a V8 was perfect for the category. The 1970 LP-series received new doors that went down deeper, eliminating the exposed steps and many of the various hatches. The roof was higher, and the front turn signals moved outwards so as to be visible from the sides of the truck. The smaller versions continued with the old cab. The heaviest models featured a lot of parts that were developed for the succeeding New Generation trucks, and are sometimes called the \\"Between Generation\\" (Zwischen-Generation). Towards the end of production of the V10 trucks, they received newly developed planetary axles as the earlier designs could not quite handle the V10's torque.

It is a part of Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways. This line upon construction will improve rail connectivity of western Tamilnadu with Karnataka.This line would give direct rail connectivity between coimbatore and mysore and will reduce the travel distance from Coimbatore to Mysore and Bangalore.It will also connect Tamilnadu with southern districts of Karnataka. History During British Rule several surveys were done in 1922, 1936 and 1942 and survey stones were also laid for the proposed railway line. But after Independence the scheme did not take off and was rejected later amid concerns over destruction of forests and wildlife. During Pawan Kumar Bansal's Tenure He Announced in railway budget that ministry revived an old proposal to lay a broad-gauge railway line through the dense forests of Chamarajnagar-Sathyamangalam-Mettupalayam. In his speech, Bansal said the proposal was neglected for long because of the lack of environmental clearance. To justify his decision to revive the project, Bansal said the Karnataka government had expressed its willingness to meet 50% of the construction cost along with providing the required land free of cost. Ironically, the minister made this announcement just after he expressed anxiety over the growing elephant deaths due to speeding trains. During the first half of his speech, the minister said railways would work along with the Union ministry of environment and forests to find strategies to avert collision involving trains and elephants. \\"The project was shelved following strong public protest as they believed it would wipe out the elephant population in Sathyamnagam.\\" Even though the minister claimed to have Karnataka's support, Tamil Nadu remains silent about the fact that the proposed route would pass through Sathyamangalam and Mettupalayam forests, which constitutes the elephant corridor linking western and eastern ghats. Five years ago, chief engineer-construction (west) of south western railway approached Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court seeking permission for the Tamil Nadu forest department to conduct a feasibility survey for the railway line. But the permission was not granted. As per railways own admission, the proposed railway line would pass through 58 km of dense forest area in Tamil Nadu and even the survey work involves the felling of trees. A document prepared by railways says the railway line will come under the Nilgiris eastern ghat elephant reserve, part of the Nilgiris biosphere reserve and proposed Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.' The proposed railway line will pass through erstwhile Veerappan territories like Talavadi, Gattawadi and Bannari. Around a dozen conservation groups in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu fear that the project could cause enormous destruction to the sandalwood forests and Asiatic elephants of the region. Along with other conservation groups and Karnataka, the Tamil Nadu Green Movement is planning to approach the Supreme Court, as the proposed line would divide the only contiguous elephant habitat spread across 15,000 km2 in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Now, if the new railway line comes through, large tracts of forests from the north-eastern slope. However, railway sources claim the new line would directly connect north western Tamil Nadu with regions of Karnataka including Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya, Mangaluru and Hassan, besides boosting transportation in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. According to railways, they have no alternative to the dense forests of Sathyamangalam. Route The revived proposal was initially prepared way back in 1915 to link Palani with Chamrajanagar. It was planned via Kangeyam, Erode, Gobichettipalayam and Sathyamangalam. The British had conducted surveys in 1922, 1936 and 1942 and survey stones were also laid for the proposed railway line. Later the proposal was changed. The proposed railway line will pass through reserve forest areas like Satyamangalam forest, Nilgiri hills. Places in between Chamrajnagar and Coimbatore like Talavadi, Gattawadi, Bannari, Satyamangalam, Gobichettipalayam, Erode, Mettupalayam will be connected through this line. On completion, the railway line would have 277 bridges, 138 curves and 61 tunnels. There have been suggestion to use tunnel boring machine to drill tunnels which will be less pollutive. There have been suggestion for laying railway line without destruction of forest. One of the suggested routes is Sathyamangalam, Pulliyampatti, Avnashi, Tirupur (Vanjipalayam) or Tirupur. From Vanjipalayam line can be connected to Tirupur to Coimbatore main line. Another suggestion is through Sathyamangalam, Annur, Mettupalayam. From there, Mettupalayam - Coimbatore main line can be used to connect with Coimbatore. Ecological concerns Conservation biologists and ecologists have raised concerns about the ecological impact on the proposed railway line. Over 58 km of the railway line passing through the Sathyamangalam tiger reserve and Nilgiri biosphere reserve will mean wildlife mortality due to railway collision almost on daily basis. Economic factors The new line would directly connect northwestern Tamil Nadu cities such as Coimbatore, Tiripur, Erode, Nilgris, Karur with regions of Karnataka including Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya, Mangaluru and Hassan, besides boosting transportation in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The proposed line will reduce the travel time to Mysuru and Bengaluru by more than half compared to the current route.

Until 2000, the Werdau‚ÄìMehltheuer railway branched off here, but this section of the line is now closed.  History The station was opened in 1845. Traffic on the line south of the station ran over the wye junction towards Reichenbach im Vogtland, Hof, Munich and the Allg√§u as well as towards Zwickau, Chemnitz and Dresden. It is one of the oldest railway stations in Saxony. The branch line to W√ºnschendorf, also called the Th√ºringer Waldbahn (Thuringian Forest Railway), was opened in 1876. A new station building was opened in 1877 and it was extended in 1907. It has a stuccoed dining room, railway apartments, a luggage handling facility and a railway post office, as well as houses for the station staff. Around 1900, the station was rebuilt and the route to W√ºnschendorf changed. Instead of connecting to the station from the south, it now entered from the north, connecting to the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway at a flying junction with a track of the line to W√ºnschendorf built above the Plauen‚ÄìLeipzig line. Werdau became a rail junction, an important center with a locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) and a carriage works. There was also a locomotive shed. Werdau became a leading industrial city. Passenger traffic to W√ºnschendorf was discontinued in 1999. Subsequently, some facilities were dismantled. The flying junction north of the station was removed, a road bypass was built without abridge over the path of the railway, so the line is now broken between Werdau West and Werdau. An electronic interlocking was put into operation in 1999. The historic station, which was partly renovated up to 2003, will become a stop for public transport in 2017. The monument protection of the station was lifted in 2016. Many citizens have signed a petition to preserve the station. The civic association Wir in Werdau S√ºd e.V. (\\"We in Werdau South\\"), which stands for the preservation of Werdau station was founded in 2016. In the 2017 timetable, services to Werdau will be replaced by lines S5 and S5X of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland (Halle (Saale) Hbf‚ÄìZwickau (Sachs) Hbf) and line R2 operated by the Vogtlandbahn (Zwickau (Sachs) Hbf‚ÄìCheb). The trains of the R2 service will reverse in Werdau to continue their journeys.  Infrastructure The tracks are accessed through the historic railway station. In 2000, direct railway access to platform 1, the Werdau‚ÄìMehltheuer railway platform, was removed and the other platforms (tracks 1‚Äì4, now only having access through the station hall) were modernised. Before the modern development, access to the railway tracks was also possible directly from the street. New doors, windows, floors, false ceilings, a disabled toilet, a new heating system, a new ticket vending machines as well as a renovated retail area in the former luggage storage area were built up to 2000. Platforms (2016)  Connections Werdau has bus stops in front of the historic station building. Daily, three or four buses stop next to the footpath in front of the station entrance. Buses can also stop in front of the former dining room. There are also several large covered bus stops, as well as a covered taxis area just in front of the historic station. There are about 50 parking spaces at the station building. State road 289 is to the west of the station, but it is not directly accessible.

In the past two years he has been looking at the world through the lens of the Apple. The most humble of all fruits has been there at every stage of the history of humankind ‚Äì from Adam & Eve to Snow White, through C√©zanne, Magritte, and Newton ‚Äì and it is the perfect vehicle for cultural observation.  Career  Barford graduated with a First Class BA Hons in 3D Design at Plymouth University in 2000. In 1999 he took part in the Erasmus Programme, travelling to The Higher Institute for Artistic Industries in Faenza, Italy.He went on to graduate from Royal College of Art in 2002 with an MA in Ceramics and Glass. He has been an associate lecturer at Central Saint Martins in London since 2004. In 2015 Barford created The Tower of Babel for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Alun Graves, Senior Curator of Ceramics and Glass Collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum described the sculptural installation as \\"a groundbreaking project\\" for the museum. Standing six metres high, it was made up of 3000 individual bone china buildings, each depicting a real London shop photographed by the artist. Derelict shops and pound stores appeared at the bottom of the Tower, while London's exclusive boutiques and galleries featured at the summit. Explicitly blurring the boundaries of art and commerce, each shop was for sale through the Victoria and Albert Museum. With prices rising as the Tower ascends, it forced people to confront where they fit into the hierarchy of consumption. In the two years it took to make The Tower of Babel, Barford cycled over 1000 miles and visited every postcode in London. In the same year Barford was commissioned to create a permanent public artwork for the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The Elephant and The Tortoise is a 4 x 2 meter stainless steel sculpture which commemorates British Xylonite's Halex Factory that stood on the site in Highams Park between 1897 and 1971. In 2013 a major exhibition charting Barford's practice to date was mounted at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art in the US. This exhibition then travelled to Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2014. Also in 2014 Barford was commissioned to create five permanent wall sculptures for the Louis Vuitton Townhouse inside London's Selfridges, each sculpture was made from \\"thousands of ceramic and porcelain flowers, leaves and butterflies\\". In 2008 Barford made Damaged Goods, an animated film commissioned and funded by Channel 4 and Arts Council England. The film told a love story featuring porcelain figurines and was set on the shelves of a bric-a-brac shop.

Map of ocean currents circa 1943 This photo demonstrates the dispersal of plastic fragments of various sizes Visualization of the flow pattern of ocean pollutants The South Pacific garbage patch is an area of ocean with increased levels of marine debris and plastic particle pollution, within the ocean's pelagic zone. This area is in the South Pacific Gyre, which itself spans from waters east of Australia to the South American continent, as far north as the Equator, and south until reaching the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The degradation of plastics in the ocean also leads to a rise in the level of toxics in the area. The garbage patch was confirmed in mid-2017, and has been compared to the Great Pacific garbage patch's state in 2007, making the former ten years younger. The South Pacific garbage patch is impossible to detect using satellites, or other visual means as most particles are smaller than a grain of rice. Discovery Evidence pointing to the existence of a garbage patch in the South Pacific gyre was made in early 2011 and its existence was confirmed in mid-2017. The discovery was made after a research voyage made by the 5 Gyres Institute. The voyage ran from March to April 2011, following a route based on a model of ocean currents developed by Nikolia Maximenko of the University of Hawaii, which predicts floating debris accumulation zones. The expedition started taking samples off the coast of Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile, and began working its way west, collecting new samples every 50 nautical miles, reaching the waters off Easter Island, and eventually Pitcairn Island. A second water sampling voyage departing from Long Beach, California on November 2, 2016, lasting six months, was led by Charles J. Moore, and a team of researchers from Algalita Marine Research and Education. Upon departure the vessel began its journey south along the Baja California peninsula and on to the Galapagos Islands, continuing southwest on to Easter Island. After departing Easter Island the crew then headed eastward to the Juan Fernandez Islands, after which it continued north following the coast of Chile, with stopping points at Antofagasta, Chile, and Arica, Chile, before heading further out to sea for its return journey to Long Beach. Composition, concentration and size During the 5 Gyres expedition, 48 samples were taken from a 2,424 nautical sweep. The researchers found an increase in plastic pollution density, averaging 26,898 particles per square kilometer, but spiking at up to 396,342 particles per square kilometer, peaking near the center of the predicted accumulation zone, with some estimates as high as one million particles per square kilometer. The composition of the garbage patch consists mainly of microbeads, tiny abrasives less than 5 micrometers in size usually found in certain personal hygiene products, microscopic fibers from washing clothes, fishing debris from southern hemisphere fishermen, and microscopic fragments of larger pieces which have been broken down in the ocean. The elevated levels of pollutants can be detected over a vast area estimated to be 2.6 million square kilometers (one million square miles), or about 1.5 times the size of Texas, with the debris found along a nearly 2,500 nautical mile straight line route. Effects on marine life and the ocean As the plastic particles are primarily found in the pelagic layer of the ocean they experience high levels of Photodegradation, which causes the plastics to break down into ever smaller pieces. These pieces eventually become so small that even microorganisms can ingest and metabolize them, converting the plastics into carbon dioxide. In some instances, these microplastics are absorbed directly into a microorganism's biomolecules. However, before reaching this state, any number of organisms could potentially interact with these plastics. During their expedition in 2016-2017, Charles Moore and Algalita found that more than 35% of south Pacific Lanternfish had consumed plastic particles. When ingested by the fish, the chemical compounds found in these plastics cannot be digested. This can affect humans, as the Lanternfish is a food source for both salmon and tuna. In their PNAS journal, Dr Van Sebille and his colleagues report data showing that in 1960 less than 5% of seabirds were found to have consumed waste material, while as of August 2015 that figure climbed to about 90%. It is predicted that by 2050, 99% of seabirds will have consumed such materials. Scientists studying the stomach contents of Laysan Albatross chicks report a 40% mortality rate before fledging. When the stomach contents were analyzed following necropsies, they were found to contain plastic waste. Not only do plastic pellets used in manufacturing worldwide absorb toxic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs from the water, but they can even leach chemicals such as biphenyl. It is estimated that up to 267 marine species are affected by plastic pollution. Researchers led by chemist Katsuhiko Saido, a graduate from Nihon University's College of Pharmacy in Japan, have collected seawater samples worldwide, including from waters of the United States, Japan, India, and Europe. All samples collected were found to contain polystyrene derivatives. Polystyrene is a plastic found in styrofoam and many household and consumer goods. The scientists then simulated the decomposition of polystyrene in the open ocean. The results of this simulation showed that polystyrene, which begins breaking down at temperatures of 86¬∞ and higher, breaks down into harmful chemicals, such as Bisphenol A (BPA, which can cause reproductive harm in animals), styrene monomer (a suspected carcinogen), and styrene trimer (a by-product of polystyrene). One study shows estimates of 5.25 trillion individual pieces of microplastics, weighing nearly 267,000 tons are currently floating in our oceans. It has been estimated that since being invented, 8.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced, with 80% (6.64 billion tons) being dumped in landfills, on land, and in the oceans. Plastic particles don't biodegrade or break down, but just fragment into smaller pieces. If current trends in the amount of plastics flowing into our oceans continue, along with overfishing, plastics will outweigh fish in the oceans by 2050.

History In 2009, Steve Merila began to brew beer in some of the empty warehouse space which his wood flooring distribution business was not using. The original intent was to serve the beer at wood flooring seminars Merila held. Additionally, he began to offer beer to customers at his store. There was a bookshelf in his office which rotated out of the wall, revealing a small lounge with a couch and a bar. Jason Medvec joined Merila during Minnesota's \\"Winterfest\\" in February 2011. As the beer began to develop a following, it was decided to start their own brewery, called Big Wood Brewery due to their history in the wood flooring industry. Slightly later in 2011, they hired their first professional brewer, Ty McBee. Their first official beer was a stout, \\"Morning Wood\\", which won \\"best beer\\" at the regional Autumn Beer Review (which it won again in 2012). Their two biggest sellers are \\"Jack Savage\\" (an American Pale Ale) and \\"Bad Axe\\" (a seasonal Imperial IPA). Other beers include \\"Wicked Ex\\" (another IPA), Weissenheimer\\" (a wheat ale), and \\"Bark Bite\\" (IPA). In 2012 the brewery was named \\"#1 Minnesota Brewery at the St. Paul Summer Beer Fest. When they began looking for a location to expand their operations and move it out of the warehouse space, the decision was to move to White Bear Lake, where they would be the only local brewery. They selected a century old building in which to house their brewing operations, as well as open a taproom. In 2013 Big Wood began to offer four of its products ‚Äì Jack Savage, Morning Wood, Bark Bite, and Bad Axe - in 16 ounce aluminum cans, as a way to expand their market. The brewery moved from its warehouse location to its current address in White Bear Lake at the beginning of 2013. In February 2014, the brewery opened their taproom to the public, and along with dozens of other local breweries, they are part of a campaign by both Explore Minnesota (the Minnesota Department of Tourism) and the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild to promote, \\"brewcations\\", which highlight tours of those breweries. The taproom was constructed using materials recovered from historic area buildings and barns, as well as from trees downed in storms. In 2016 the brewery began a \\"Taproom Series\\" of craft beers, where they release a previously taproom-only beer every three months, in both bottles and kegs. The premier offering in the series was \\"FINE!\\", an IPA. In 2017, their \\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Beer\\" was selected as one of the craft beers to be served at the Minnesota State Fair. The brewery's beers and ales can be found in bars and liquor stores throughout Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin.

The book is based on pillars of advice Pollack wrote in 2013 on an index card. Background The original image of the index card, posted to Pollack's blog In April 2013, Pollack interviewed Olen about her book Pound Foolish, and metaphorically mentioned \\"that the best [financial] advice for most people would fit on an index card\\". Pollack further said, \\"if you're paying someone for advice, almost by definition, you're probably getting the wrong advice because the correct advice is so straightforward.\\" Emails and comments on his blog asked for a real index card with financial advice, so Pollack jotted down nine rules in two minutes, took a picture of it, and posted it online. The image went viral, and was covered on many internet news sites. Pollack and Olen wrote The Index Card three years later, which Pollack compares with the original index card as commentary to the Ten Commandments. Content Olen and Pollack suggest investing in diversified mutual funds, paying one's entire credit card balance each month, having a financial advisor commit to a fiduciary standard, and using Roth, SEP and 529 accounts. The book and index card also contain some \\"simple\\" advice, such as saving 10 to 20 percent of one's income, maxing out a 401(k), and not buying individual securities. They also include more \\"subtle\\" advice on how to choose and interact with a financial advisor. The book has rules about buying a home and insurance, topics they felt were left out from the first list. Reception Publishers Weekly said that while the book had an \\"admirable mission,\\" the rules it advances \\"are too old and readily available in any listicle to be worth building a book around.\\" It called the book \\"unsatisfying to all but the most unaware consumers\\". Both the book and image received criticism about the last rule, a social safety net, saying that it was more political than financial. Pollack says \\"that the American taxpayer had my back when I had a crisis\\", and he \\"should be doing the same thing for other people\\", referring to the time when he and his wife took care of his intellectually disabled brother-in-law. He also received emails about his original card from people who could not save the 20% he suggested, so he lowered the number to 10% in the book.

She then was at Tahiti again in December. John Palmer returned to England on 10 April 1829 with 650 casks. On 23 October 1827, John Palmer was at Lahaina, Hawaii. There local women came on board and bartered sexual favors for goods, in violation of the local government's prohibition of such activities. When Clark took a boat ashore, Maui Governor Hoapili, responding to concerns of Christian missionaries living there, seized Clark and the sailors manning the boat. Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land the women at Lahaina. Clark had left instructions with the mate to fire some shots if Clark had not returned in an hour. Before Clark returned to John Palmer the mate fired five 9-pounder shots towards the house of the missionary William Richards, some of which landed in the yard without doing serious damage. Richards and his wife took shelter in the basement. Clark and his men returned to John Palmer and then sailed off without landing the women. Kahekili, a local warrior, commanded a small battery on the walls of a fort at Lahaina. He requested permission to return fire, which Hoapili refused. Hoapili then in 1831 built a more substantial fort, Old Lahaina Fort, to protect the town from riotous sailors. =Whaling voyage #3 (1829-1833)= Captain Clark sailed from England on 21 July 1829, bound for the South Seas fishery.

Rubbing of the Huayi Tu Stele from the Library of Congress. The actual size is about three feet square. The Hua Yi Tu (ËèØÂ§∑Âúñ, Map of China and the Barbarian Countries) is a map engraved as a stone stele in 7th year of Fuchang era (1136 CE). It is the earliest surviving map of China that relates China with other foreign states. The stele is now in the Stele Forest or Beilin Museum (Á¢ëÊûó; pinyin: Bƒìil√≠n) in Xi'an, China. Origin The stele was commissioned under the Great Qi dynasty, a puppet state of the Jurchen Jin which ruled over northern China at that time. The stone stele stands 1136.79 tall and 79 cm wide, with the map measuring 79 cm high and 78 cm wide. An unknown cartographer engraved the Huayi map. Features The map depicts mountains, rivers, lakes, as well as more than 400 administrative place names of China. It covers an area bounded in the north by the Great Wall of China, northeast by Heilongjiang region, extending south to the island of Hainan. At the edges of the map are a few other states such as Korea (Goryeo) on the northeast and India (Tianzu) on the southwest. The map of China is surrounded by blocks of texts, which references back to the Tang dynasty map of Jia Dan (scholar and cartographer) called Hainei Huayi Tu (Map of China and the Barbarian Countries within the Seas) presented to Emperor Dezong of Tang in 801. The later Huayi Tu map covers China during the Jin and Southern Song Dynasty. The texts arranged around the edges of the map provides information from historical and other sources briefly explaining markers such as the Great Wall, the size of the empire, brief descriptions of Korea, Japan and other foreign states as well as lists of the states to the south and west of China. Rubbing of Yuji Tu on the reverse side of Huayi tu is the gridded Yu Ji Tu (Map of the Tracks of Yu the Great) carved in 1142. This map is the earliest surviving example of lattice cartographic grid found in Chinese map. The stele containing the carved map is thought to be stored at the Stele Forest in Xi'an, but is not displayed due to the political sensitivity of not depicting the island of Taiwan on it, which can be interpreted as Taiwan not belonging to China at the time of the map's production.

It is Williams' first feature film, after a number of shorts. The Human Surge is divided into three separate narrative and geographical segments: the first in Buenos Aires, the second in Maputo, and the third in Bohol. Each segment follows a handful of characters, who are often seen loitering or moving between spaces, such as workplace and home. The segments are linked with diegetic bridges. Williams has stated that he wanted to explore the sensation and feelings related to aimlessness and travel, and thereby \\"create a rhythm between excitement and boredom or surprise and depression.\\"Gustavo Beck, \\"Embracing Uncertainty: An Interview with Eduardo Williams,\\" MUBI, August 8, 2016. The characters depicted in the three segments are invariably poor, restless and on the search for connection with other human beings. The film premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in 2016, where it won the Golden Leopard - Filmmakers of the Present. It was subsequently released at film festivals in Toronto and New York to critical acclaim. Comparisons have been made to other filmmakers working in the slow cinema subgenre, where emphasis is made on the durational aspect of film, rather than its narrative qualities. Synopsis In Buenos Aires, the 25-year-old Exe is seen waking up and getting dressed in his apartment. He wades through a flooded neighbourhood to arrive at his workplace, a supermarket, only to be fired from his position. He subsequently spends time with his friends and family, loitering with the former in urban spaces and visiting online sex chat rooms. They perform sex acts, like fellatio, on each other in front of a web camera for virtual payment. The movie moves on to the next segment through the window of a Chaturbate website, in which a group of African teenagers in Maputo, Mozambique are also seen engaging in cybersex for money. The Mozambique characters are also unemployed and empoverished, and perambulate through the streets between odd jobs and social events. One character is found urinating on an anthill, which functions as a diegetic segue to the film's third segment, when the camera follows ants moving into the earth, before finally arriving at a hand holding a smartphone in a jungle somewhere in the Philippines. The film subsequently follows a couple of characters bathing together and walking through the jungle, in particular one woman looking to charge her cellphone. Finally, the film moves into a technological factory in Bohol, where tablet computers are made on an assembly line. The last words are spoken by a machine, repeatedly saying \\"Okay.\\" Production Williams had made six short films before his feature debut The Human Surge, in which he had experimented with different video formats and textures.Ela Bittencourt, \\"Interview: Eduardo Williams,\\" Film Comment, October 5, 2016. In the short films Pude ver in Puma (eng. Could See a Puma, 2011)Pude ver un Puma, Universidad del Cine (Vimeo), accessed August 14, 2017. and T√¥i qu√™n r√¥i! (eng. I forgot!, 2014), he and his usual cinematographers Joaquin Neira and Julien Guillery experimented with various aesthetic strategies‚Äînotably the use of long, handheld tracking shots (often described as \\"floating\\" and \\"restless\\"), amateur photography, as well as elliptical storytelling‚Äîwhich they also used in The Human Surge.Nick Pinkerton, \\"Mountain Out of an Anthill,\\" Artforum, February 3, 2017. For The Human Surge, Williams used three different video formats, one for each segment: the Argentine segment was shot on 16 mm film, the Mozambique part with a Blackmagic pocket camera‚Äîsubsequently recaptured in Super 16 from a computer monitor, and the final Philippine sequence on a digital RED camera.Andr√©a Picard, \\"Aboard the Human Express,\\" Metrograph, March 1, 2017.Mark Peranson, \\"The Human Surge,\\" Locarno Festival in Los Angeles, accessed August 14, 2017. : ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. \\"El auge del humano,\\" PardoLive, August 8, 2016. : ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. \\"Cinema Scope 68 Editor's Note,\\" Cinema Scope 68, 2016. In the Mozambique segment, Williams operated the camera himself, considering it \\"so small,\\" whereas in the two other segments he was helped by several assistants. In his first short films, Williams had regularly employed a domestic Argentine setting. However, in the latest shorts‚ÄîThat I'm Falling? (2013) and I forgot! (2014)‚Äîhe opted for different locales, Sierra Leone and Vietnam, respectively. Having travelled abroad only very rarely as a young man, Williams was struck by the beauty of foreign languages, and wanted to use them in a filmic context. He eventually also discovering a charm in his own vernacular, spoken Spanish. Analysis The film has been analysed for its commonalities with other entries in Williams' oeuvre, most notably the themes of alienation in the internet age, and how modern technology creates distance between people. Picking up on the theme of internet psychology, critic Nick Pinkerton praises Williams' ability in addressing \\"the enormous cognitive earthquake represented by the internet's colonization of daily life\\". Several critics have found certain organizational elements within the film and, by extension, Williams' oeuvre. Leo Goldsmith of Cinema Scope has called Williams' work a \\"cinema of vectors\\", noting the constant geographical and ontological displacement throughout his films. Ambulatory passages are frequent in Williams' cinema, where (often young) characters are seen moving through dilapidated apartments, supermarkets, areas of urban decay, jungles, rocky hillsides and caves. The novelty in The Human Surge lies in its movement from literal/concrete places (anthill) to abstract/figurative places (internet). In the final segment, Williams wanted to address the \\"illusion of escape\\", by moving to the natural, verdant greens of the Filipino jungle, only to pull back into a machine-filled factory, which he found to be a \\"very strange\\" and \\"very digital place\\".P. M. Cicchetti, \\"An Interview with The Human Surge's Eduardo Williams,\\" Reverse Shot (Museum of the Moving Image), March 2, 2017. Serbo-Croatian filmmaker Iva Radivojevic compared Williams' film to Lucrecia Martel's La Ci√©naga (2001, eng. 'The Swamp'). Beyond both being feature debuts from Argentinian filmmakers, Radivojevic found The Human Surge to be starting \\"in a kind of swamp\\" and sharing a \\"mystical quality\\" with Martel's film, causing the spectator to be \\"injected into a kind of vacuum of time\\".\\"Notebook's 9th Writers Poll: Fantasy Double Features of 2016,\\" MUBI, December 28, 2016.

In an interview with the director for Filmmaker Magazine, critic Vadim Rizov picked up on that theme, and considered Hungarian filmmaker B√©la Tarr as an important influence on the film's long tracking shots, which follows characters moving through space. He also mentioned van Sant, finding the handheld camera to be suggestive of \\"the physical foot leather fueling the camerawork.\\"Vadim Rizov, \\"The Art of Walking: Eduardo Williams on The Human Surge,\\" Filmmaker Magazine, January 18, 2017. Some critics were less enthusiastic about the film. Jessica Kiang panned the film for Variety, claiming that while Williams' \\"formal rigor is to be admired\\", the humans in the film are \\"little more than microbes in the petri dish [of the filmmakers'] \\"formalist experiment.\\" Kiang concluded that the film is, \\"a victim of its own effectiveness: It's rigorous, rarefied, and utterly remote\\".Jessica Kiang, \\"Film Review: The Human Surge (2017),\\" Variety.com, February 9, 2017. Carson Lund of Slant Magazine was also critical of the feature, considering it to be easily mistaken for \\"a particularly interminable YouTube video\\".Carson Lund, \\"The Human Surge,\\" Slant Magazine, February 24, 2017.

Whilst there, she gave Anna Wintour her first magazine job. Hocking then pursued fashion design, before rediscovering success as a mature model in the 1990s, when she was described as a \\"grande dame\\" after her appearance in Mario Testino's shoots for Burberry. Early life Hocking was born in Sydney, where she went to art school. In 1952 she borrowed the fare from her brother and sailed to the United Kingdom to pursue a career as a fashion model. Whilst there, she married a male model and actor called Nigel Howland. The marriage eventually ended in divorce. Career =Modelling, part 1= Hocking began her career as a model by doing fashion shows, but eventually became a leading photographic model, basing her style on that of a leading American model, Anne St. Marie. In 1956 Hocking was named London Model of the Year by The Daily Express. Although she could present as aloof and sophisticated, she also had an approachable quality, which enabled her modelling career to be most successful during the transitional period between the 1950s and the mid-1960s, as she resembled a young career woman rather than one of the haughty ladies favoured for 1950s fashion photography. Along with Paulene Stone, she became a favoured model of Terence Donovan and David Montgomery. Brian Duffy photographed her with the author Frank Norman. However, Hocking became aware that her maturity was working against her, as teenage models began to be more popular, and she ceased modelling. =Journalism= Hocking's first job after quitting modelling was as a stylist for Fashion, before being transferred to Harper's Bazaar and succeeding Molly Parkin as fashion editor. She stayed on in 1970 when Harper's Bazaar merged with Queen to become Harper's & Queen. Whilst at Harper's & Queen, Hocking was challenged by the small budgets and tiny fashion department, but hired a young 21-year old Anna Wintour as her editorial assistant as she was impressed by Wintour's precocious professionalism. In 1974, Hocking was asked by the Fashion Museum, Bath to choose that year's defining looks for their Dress of the Year collection, for which she selected male and female knitted ensembles by Missoni. A couple of years later, Hocking helped style Joanna Lumley for some episodes of The New Avengers. Following the decision of Harpers & Queen to try and challenge British Vogue's place at the top of the British fashion magazine hierarchy, Hocking decided to leave, and was succeeded by Min Hogg despite Wintour trying for the job. =Fashion design= After leaving Harper's & Queen, Hocking became a fashion designer for Christopher Carr Jones's mail-order company, and then started up her own equivalent business. =Modelling, part 2= In the 1990s, Hocking resumed modelling as a professional mature model, and came to the attention of Mario Testino, who had been seeking out other models that had retired in the mid-1960s in order to develop the narrative of his photographs for Burberry. Along with Tania Mallet, Hocking became one of Testino's favourite models as a representation of the \\"early-60s Englishness\\" that enhanced the Burberry brand. In 2002, The New York Times described Hocking and Mallet as \\"grande dames\\" who looked as good in Burberry fashion as their co-star, the young and glamorous Elizabeth Jagger. Later life and death Hocking died in 2011 of cancer at the age of 81. She was survived by her daughter Wendy, also a model, and her son Julian.

In the context of Swedish expansion within Scandinavia, Swedification can refer to both the integration of Scania in the 1600s and governmental policies regarding S√°mi and Finns in northern Sweden during the 1800s and 1900s. Swedification of Scania As part of the Treaty of Roskilde at the end of the Second Northern War, all areas in the historical region of Sk√•neland were ceded by Denmark- Norway to the Swedish Empire in early 1658. For the Swedish Empire, it was important to integrate these new subjects and to make the Scanians feel Swedish, rather than Danish. On 16 April 1658, representatives of Scania, Blekinge and Halland's nobility, citizens, clergy and peasants gathered in Malm√∂ to swear fealty to Charles X Gustav. The king was not present but was represented by an empty chair surrounded by Swedish soldiers. In 1662, Sweden aligned taxes and regulations in Scania with other parts of Sweden. Some of the new rules were very different from previous Danish practice; for example, the lilla tullen (\\"the small customs\\"), which charged a tax for all goods brought into cities. Other changes required each city council to have least two Swedish-born members. At the same time, inhabitants of Scania received representation in the Riksdag, unlike other areas that had been conquered by the Swedish Empire. When Charles X Gustav landed in Helsingborg in 1658, he met Bishop Peder Winstrup from Lund on the pier, who became a driving force for the establishment of the University of Lund as a Swedish counterweight to the University of Copenhagen. In 1666, the former was established under the name \\"Regia Academia Carolina\\", and its official opening ceremony took place in January 1668. About two decades after the Treaty of Roskilde, Sweden sought to more fully implement Scania, including enforcing changes to the church and local language. In 1681, local priests aligned with the Church of Sweden and court documents and ecclesiastical correspondence increasingly adopted more standard Swedish grammatical features. During the Scanian War in the late 1670s, pro-Danish Snapphane fighters aided the Danish invasion. This led to a campaign to capture, torture and execute those who would not swear allegiance to the Swedish king. The policy was effective and by 1709 when Denmark again moved to invade Scania after the Battle of Poltava local militias resisted the effort. When the Scanian War began in 1675, some 180,000 people lived in Scania. By 1718, only 132,800 were left. Some snapphane fled to Denmark; some 30,000 Scanian boys were sent to the Swedish army, many of whom were relocated to the Baltics. At the same time, Swedes were encouraged to take over Scanian farms and marry Scanian women. Swedification of S√°mi and Tornedalians Beginning in 1846, Sweden adopted policies design to define and control its northern region, and to integrate its S√°mi and Finnish populations with the Swedish nation. Although censuses began delineating among S√°mi, Finns, and Swedes as early as 1805, throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, these definitions changed based on language, occupation, religion, paternal line, and name. For S√°mi, different groups were segregated into reindeer herders, who continued a more nomadic life and were considered less developed, and farmers who were deemed by the government to be Swedes and not S√°mi. This \\"Lapp skall vara Lapp\\" (Lapp shall be Lapp) policy forced different schooling on settled children versus nomadic children. By the late 1800s, Swedish became the sole language of instruction in the Torne Valley, which was populated largely by Me√§nkieli speakers. In the 1930s, boarding schools were set up for Tornedalians and S√°mi children, where they were barred from speaking their native languages and encouraged to adopt \\"civilized\\" norms. These Swedification policies ended in the late 1970s as Sweden officially recognized S√°mi as an indigenous people of Sweden. In 2009, the Riksdag passed the Language Law (\\"Spr√•klag\\" SFS 2009:600), which recognized S√°mi languages and Me√§nkieli as official minority languages of Sweden, ensuring the right to use these languages in education and administrative proceedings. In 2020, Sweden funded the establishment of an independent truth commission to examine and document past abuse of S√°mi by the Swedish state. A parallel commission to examine past treatment of Tornedalians was also established.

Early life John Morris was born in Wimbledon on 18 February 1910, to Humphrey William Morris and Jessie Muriel, daughter of Henry Vercoe, of Pendarves, Camborne, Cornwall. Humphrey Morris had become a successful London solicitor, following his father, Howard Carlile Morris, who was a partner in a firm he had co-founded. Howard Morris's mother, Sarah Anne Carlile, was of a Scottish family; cousins were the politician and businessman Sir Hildred Carlile, 1st Baronet, and his brother Wilson Carlile, founder of the Church Army.History of the Carlile Family (Paisley Branch), by some of its members, J.

Carlile, Warren & Son, Wykeham Press, 1909, p. 98 Morris was educated at Charterhouse School where he was elected to a Holford Scholarship to read history at Christ Church, Oxford, although after two terms he switched to study law. He graduated with first class honours degrees in the Final Honour School and subsequently on the BCL. He was elected to an Eldon Law Scholarship, but was unsuccessful in his quest for the Vinerian Scholarship. In 1934 he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn, but he did not enjoy legal practice. In 1936 he left to return to Oxford at a tutor in law at Magdalen College, Oxford where (with the exception of one year as a visiting fellow at Harvard) he would spend the remainder of his professional life. During his brief career at the Bar, he did appear on one occasion before the House of Lords in Government of India v Taylor [1955] AC 491. In 1939 he married (Mercy) Jane, daughter of civil servant Stanley Asher Kinch. They never had children. War service At the outbreak of World War II Morris was too old to enlist, so instead joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was posted initially to the Faroe Islands to defend against possible attack, and was later involved in allied training operations preparing for D-Day. Academic contributions After arriving at Magdalen, Morris was credited with transforming the teaching of law at the college, including the recruitment of key academics such as Rupert Cross. Two students who claimed to have been particularly influenced by him was Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Ronald Dworkin. Unusually, he never held a chair at Oxford. He was reportedly offered the post of Vinerian Professor of English Law in 1954, but declined in favour of his colleague, Rupert Cross. He is most famous for his contributions to private international law. Whilst at Harvard he published a notable article in Harvard Law Review on the subject,The Proper Law of the Tort (1951) 64 Harv LR 881 and he taught the subject for decades to BCL students at Oxford. But he is most famous as general editor of what is now as Dicey Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws. However he also published the 9th edition of Theobald on Wills and Cases on Private International Law, and wrote extensively on property law.Ulterior Limitations and Rule against Perpetuities (1950) 10 CLJ 392, The Rule against Perpetuities and the Rule in Andrews v. Partington (1954) 70 LQR 61. Morris was a longstanding critic of the double actionability rule in tort, but did not live long enough to see the rule relaxed by the Privy Council in Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA [1995] 1 AC 190. Upon his retirement Morris was honoured with a book published in dedication to him: Contemporary Problems in the Conflict of Law: Essays in Honour of John Humphrey Carlile Morris. The foreword was written by Lord Scarman, who expressed himself as indebted to Morris for his guidance during his (Scarman's) time as Chairman of the Law Commission. Outside of his academic and legal career, Morris wrote Thank You, Wodehouse in 1981, a book of essays about the work of comic novelist P.G. Wodehouse, of whom Morris was a devoted fan.

Beside the monasteries of Agios Dionysios and Agia Triada, Sparmos it is one of the monasteries located at Mount Olympus. Location and name The convent is located east of Karya, on the road connecting it with Leptokarya, above the river Ziliana. The distance to Leptokarya is about 18 km, the distance (air line) to the ancient Leivithra is about 7 km. It is located at an altitude of 820 m and is surrounded by forest. The name of the monastery refers to four wild brooks in the vicinity, called kanalia (Œ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¨ŒªŒπŒ±, \\"channels\\"), which combined to form the Ziliana river. History Frescoes in the chapel from 1638 According to tradition, the monastery was founded in 1055 by the monks Damian and Joachim, who dedicated it to the birth of the Holy Mother of God (Theotokos). The 19th-century French traveller L√©on Heuzey, on the other hand, dated the foundation of the monastery to the ninth century.L√©on Heuzey: Le mont Olympe et l'Acarnanie: exploration de ces deux r√©gions, avec l √©tude de leurs antiquit√©s, de leurs populations anciennes et modernes, de leur g√©ographie et de leur histoire.

At that time, the complex consisted of the refectory and the katholikon. In 1681, a chapel dedicated to Saint Demetrios was added. The western wing, which now houses the cells of the inhabitants, was built later. The monastery flourished in the 17th century, when large-scale restoration and decoration work took place in the complex. During the 19th century, the complex was raided and suffered considerable devastation.

Buildings Parts of the original complex survive: the high fortified wall surrounding it, the refectory in the northern part, a handful of cells on the northeaster side, the katholikon, and the chapel of Saint Demetrios. The katholikon is a three-aisled basilica topped by a dome. It had a separate upper gallery for women (gynaikonites). It was built in 1833, collapsed in 1881, and rebuilt in 1883 to the designs of the architect Efthymios Milios from Pentalofos. Its masonry is of locally quarried stone and marble. The chapel of Saint Demetrios is a small, single- room building that was built in 1684 and painted in 1689‚Äì1696. The small cemetery chapel dedicated to All Saints is the oldest building, with frescoes dating to 1638. The refectory is an elongated building with three apses on its eastern end, which are also decorated with frescoes.

While a partner at Jones Day, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Senate confirmed his appointment on October 11, 2018.  Early life and education  Dreiband graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. in history in 1986. He has a Master of Theological Studies from the Harvard Divinity School, and a Juris Doctor from the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law. Career  Upon graduating from law school, Dreiband served as a law clerk to Judge William Joseph Bauer of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Following his clerkship, Dreiband served in the Independent Counsel's office for the Whitewater controversy. After a stint in private practice, Dreiband served in the administration of George W. Bush as deputy administrator of the United States Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) from 2002 to 2003 and as general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 2003 to 2005. He again returned to private practice in 2005 and joined Jones Day in 2008.  Notable cases  Dreiband takes oath as EEOC General Counsel in 2003 * In 2002, Dreiband was part of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) team that sued Chicago meat processing company Carl Buddig & Co. for not hiring black people at its Chicago and South Holland meat processing plants and for limiting higher pay opportunities for women. The company settled and agreed to pay US$2.5 million and reform its hiring practices. *Gonz√°lez v. Abercrombie & Fitch ‚Äì in 2004, he represented the EEOC in a lawsuit against retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. The company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions and store management positions to white males. The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit.\\"National Clothing Retailer Must Pay For Discrimination\\" The Defender. Winter 2005, 1. A publication of the NAACP LDF. Description of the settlement of Gonzalez. *Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores ‚Äì he represented Abercrombie & Fitch in a lawsuit filed in 2009 in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In June 2008, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf, who wears a hijab due to her religious beliefs, applied for a sales position at an Abercrombie Kids store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She claimed the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's \\"Look Policy\\". The United States Supreme Court ruled 8‚Äì1 against the company in 2015. *In 2016, Dreiband defended the University of North Carolina in its choice to abide by the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act that had been passed earlier that year. The statewide law disallowed people from using public bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify; it was repealed in March 2017. *In 2020, Dreiband celebrated when the Republican majority on the Michigan Supreme Court struck down a face mask mandate intended to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Dreiband said, \\"The Constitution does not permit any public official unlawfully to restrict our liberty.\\"  Controversies  On June 10, 2020, Dreiband sent a letter to Montgomery County Maryland executives expressing First Amendment concerns regarding county orders. The letter urges County Executive Elrich and the County Council to ensure that the county‚Äôs executive orders and enforcement of them respect both the right of residents to assemble and practice their faith. But the letter was based on flawed reporting, which the Justice Department has failed to publicly correct. The DOJ was trying to make a point about a Black Lives Matter protest organized by high school students on the grounds of the Connie Morella Library in Bethesda on June 2. Dreiband's letter informed County officials that if they were going to support ‚Äúhundreds of people packed into a library‚Äù for a protest, they should be equally supportive of people gathering to worship during the pandemic. But the Connie Morella Library is closed. Photos captured by local ABC-affiliate WJLA show that the protest was in the library‚Äôs parking lot. A makeshift lectern for the rally was set up in front of the library‚Äôs doors, and hundreds of attendees can be seen in photos seated on the ground outside the library. Asked about the discrepancy, a Justice Department spokesperson acknowledged to HuffPost that local Fox News affiliate WTTG had gotten the facts wrong in its story about the protest, though the station has since corrected its report. The DOJ‚Äôs original letter containing the claim that hundreds of people packed into the library could still be found on the department‚Äôs website.

He served as Mayor of Williamstown and on the Melbourne City Council, and was also a long-serving president of the Victorian Football Association. Early life and business career Liston was born in the townland of Granny, near Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland, the son of Mary Ann (n√©e McNamany) and John Haire Liston, a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary. John Liston was dismissed from the police in 1873, and the family moved to Australia in 1882, settling in Williamstown, Victoria. After leaving school, Liston trained as a barber and eventually started his own shop. He later became the licensee of a local hotel, and served as secretary of the Liquor Trades' Defence Union (LTDU), an organisation devoted to countering the temperance movement. Victoria held referendums on prohibition in 1930 and 1938; Liston and the LTDU played a key part in their defeat.David Dunstan, 'Liston, John James (1872‚Äì1944)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/liston-john- james-7204/text12465, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 14 August 2017. Local government Liston was elected to the Williamstown City Council in 1898, and became mayor for the first time in 1901 (reputedly the youngest in the state). He was re-elected to another six mayoral terms over the following three decades, serving from 1901 to 1902, 1913 to 1914, and 1922 to 1927. Liston represented the city on the Melbourne Harbour Trust, and oversaw the construction of the Williamstown Town Hall (opened 1927). He eventually resigned from the council in 1930, due to allegations of misconduct. In 1923, Liston had also been elected to the Melbourne City Council, where he was chairman of the traffic and building regulations committee for six years. He ran for Lord Mayor of Melbourne in 1931, but lost to Harold Gengoult Smith by a single vote. Sports Liston was a longtime member of the Williamstown Football Club, and was the club president from 1923 to 1933. He was also a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and a prominent racehorse owner, serving as president of the Williamstown Racing Club from 1939 to 1944. The Liston Stakes were named in his honour.Preview of 'Back to Caulfield' PB Lawrence Stakes Day, Melbourne Racing Club, 13 August 2015.

He loved a thrilling sporting bout and football held the highest place in his affections. He took a leading part in the politics of the Australian game.

He was prepared to kick his way through any conservatism that the greater good of the game could be served.\\"Football Has Lost Leader, The Sporting Globe, 15 April 1944. In 1945, the J. J.

He was responsible for the modernization of the Tibetan National Mint.alt= Thubten Kunphel (, 1905 ‚Äì 1963), commonly known as Kunphela, was a Tibetan politician and one of the most powerful political figures in Tibet during the later years of the 13th Dalai Lama's rule, known as the \\"strong man of Tibet\\". Kunphela was arrested and exiled after the death of the Dalai Lama in 1933. He later escaped to India and became a co-founder of the India-based Tibet Improvement Party with the aim of establishing a secular government in Tibet. He worked in Nanking after the attempt to start a revolution in Tibet failed, and returned to Tibet in 1948. Rise to power Kunphela was born as Dechen Ch√∂dr√∂n in a \\"taxpayer\\" serf family in Nyemo in 1905. At the age of 12, he was sent to Lhasa as a servant in the palace of the 13th Dalai Lama. His intelligence gained the Dalai Lama's attention, and subsequently he became a household servant, and then the favorite personal attendant, known as jensey. In the 1920s, he oversaw a series of construction tasks including the renovation of the Potala Palace and the expansion of Norbulingka. In 1931, he became the head of Trapchi Electrical Machine Office, in charge of several mints and munition factories that were considered the most modern ones of Tibet at the time. In 1932, he successfully persuaded the Dalai Lama to allow him to establish a Trongdra Regiment under his control. The soldiers were recruited from middle-class families, and the equipment and training far exceeded other Tibetan troops. By 1933, Kunphela had gained the authority of appointing and dismissing government officials. He also controlled the importation and distribution of arms and ammunition. Kunphela issued orders without the need of confirmation of the Kashag or the Dalai Lama, and his orders were obeyed as much as those from the Dalai Lama himself. He was known as the \\"strong man of Tibet\\". Downfall After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in December 1933, Kunphela's status became unclear. Initially, Kunphela was confident of his position because of his control of the Trongdra Regiment. He held the power to organize the construction of the Dalai Lama's tomb, and a large part of lay officials present in the National Assembly, composing of government officials and abbots of key monasteries, supported him to become regent even though the position was traditionally for an incarnate lama. In the meanwhile, Lungshar, one of the parties vying for control after the 13th Dalai Lama's death, conspired to accuse Kunphela of playing a role in the sudden death of the Dalai Lama, and gathered the support of a large number of abbots and monks. The charge was also given support by several Lungshar's friends in the Kashag, who confirmed that only Kunphela accompanied the Dalai Lama all the time. In the meanwhile, Lungshar took advantage of the Trongdra soldiers' dissatisfaction and successfully persuaded them to mutiny. On the third day after death of the Dalai Lama, the entire regiment demonstrated before the Norbulingka and demanded its own disbandment. The regiment was then disbanded on the Kashag's order. After the desertion of the Trongdra Regiment, Kunphela was arrested and confined in the Sharcenchog prison. Lungshar sought to inflict death or mutilation on Kunphela, but the suggestion was opposed by the Assembly. Eventually, Kunphela was only convicted of failing to deliver prompt notification about the Dalai Lama's illness, and sentenced to exile for life to Kongpo. He was banished in public on the second day before the Tibetan New Year, the most inauspicious day of the year. All his property and that of his relatives was confiscated. Kunphela's father was sent back to serve as a serf in Nyemo. Founding of Tibet Improvement Party Kunphela fled to India in 1937 together with Canglocen, a well-known poet and ex-official who was exiled because of supporting Lungshar. In Kalimpong, they met Pandatsang Rapga, a Khamba nationalist and intellectual, and started the Tibet Improvement Party in 1939. According to Pandatsang, the primary goals of the party were \\"liberation of Tibet from the existing tyrannical government,\\" and a political and societal revolution in Tibet for a secular government under the Republic of China. In 1946, the activities of Gend√ºn Ch√∂phel, a leading figure in the party, were discovered in Tibet. Under pressure from the Tibetan Government, the Government of India placed Kunphela under surveillance after 1946 and deported him to China one year later. At the time, Varanasi University offered him a position as a lecturer which would have allowed him to legally remain in India. Kunphela refused the offer and left for Shanghai in 1947. Later life After the deportation, Kunphela lived in poverty in Shanghai and Nanking for a while, but was eventually able to work for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission following an invitation. In 1947, Kunphela discovered that the ex-regent of Tibet, Reting Rinpoche Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen was appealing to the Kuomintang government to overthrow the Taktra Government in Tibet. Thubten Sangbo, the Tibetan Government's representative in Nanking, was informed. The news soon reached Lhasa, and led to Reting's arrest. Kunphela was allowed back to Lhasa in 1948, obviously because of his role in the Reting affair. According to Sampho Tenzin Dhondup, Kunphela's motive was a conflict from the time Kunphela worked for Reting's trade company in India: Kunphela made several purchases in Bombay, but was not reimbursed for his loss even though Reting's company was far from short of funds. In 1952, Kunphela was one of the staff members of the Grain Procurement Bureau, an newly established institution under the Kashag for resolving the problem of grain shortage. In 1956, Kunphela became the deputy director of the Bureau of Geology under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region (PCTAR). He attended the 8th anniversary celebrations of China in Beijing, and was received, along with other Tibetan visitors, by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Kunphela became vice-director of the Executive Office under the General Office of the Preparatory Committee. He died in Lhasa in December 22, 1963, aged 58.

The thickness of the liquid t is kept sufficiently small with respect to the mean free path length of electron scattering in the materials, so that the electron beam is transmitted through the sample for detection. The membrane windows bulge outward into the vacuum. ESEM of nanoparticles in liquid placed in a vacuum chamber containing a background pressure of vapor. The sample support stage is cooled to achieve condensation, for example, to 4 ¬∞C for 813 Pa water vapor. The electron optics in high vacuum is separated from the sample chamber by a pump limiting aperture. Detection of backscattered or secondary electrons is optimal when applying a positive electrical potential V between the sample and the detector, so that a cascade of electrons and ions is created. Liquid-phase electron microscopy (LP EM) refers to a class of methods for imaging specimens in liquid with nanometer spatial resolution using electron microscopy. LP-EM overcomes the key limitation of electron microscopy: since the electron optics requires a high vacuum, the sample must be stable in a vacuum environment. Many types of specimens relevant to biology, materials science, chemistry, geology, and physics, however, change their properties when placed in a vacuum. The ability to study liquid samples, particularly those involving water, with electron microscopy has been a wish ever since the early days of electron microscopy but technical difficulties prevented early attempts from achieving high resolution. Two basic approaches exist for imaging liquid specimens: i) closed systems, mostly referred to as liquid cell EM (LC EM), and ii) open systems, often referred to as environmental systems. In closed systems, thin windows made of materials such as silicon nitride or graphene are used to enclose a liquid for placement in the microscope vacuum. Closed cells have found widespread use in the past decade due to the availability of reliable window microfabrication technology. Graphene provides the thinnest possible window. The oldest open system that gained widespread usage was environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) of liquid samples on a cooled stage in a vacuum chamber containing a background pressure of vapor. Low vapor pressure liquids such as ionic liquids can also be studied in open systems. LP-EM systems of both open and closed type have been developed for all three main types of electron microscopy, i.e., transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Instruments integrating liquid-phase SEM with light microscopy have also been developed. Electron microscopic observation in liquid has been combined with other analytical methods such as electrochemical measurements and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The benefit of LP EM is the ability to study samples that do not withstand a vacuum or to study materials properties and reactions requiring liquid conditions. Examples of measurements enabled by this technique are the growth of metallic nanoparticles or structures in liquid, materials changes during the cycling of batteries, electrochemical processes such as metal deposition, dynamics of thin water films and diffusion processes, biomineralization processes, protein dynamics and structure, single-molecule localization of membrane proteins in mammalian cells, and the influence of drugs on receptors in cancer cells. The spatial resolution achievable can be in the sub-nanometer range and depends on the sample composition, structure and thickness, any window materials present, and the sensitivity of the sample to the electron dose required for imaging. Nanometer resolution is obtained even in micrometers-thick water layers for STEM of nanomaterials of high atomic number. Brownian motion was found to be highly reduced with respect to a bulk liquid. STEM detection is also possible in ESEM for imaging nanomaterials and biological cells in liquid. An important aspect of LP EM is the interaction of the electron beam with the sample since the electron beam initiates a complex sequence of radiolytic reactions in water. Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of LP EM data has yielded unique information in a range of scientific areas.

The lake, which only contains water when there is a high water table, lies in a hollow, a muschelkalk-karst basin. It has no surface inflow, its outflows are partly subterranean and partly through evaporation.  Location  The Eichener See lies in the Southern Black Forest Nature Park on the northeastern perimeter of the Dinkelberg ridge between the nearby village of Eichen to the west, which is part of the municipality of Schopfheim, the municipality of Hasel to the east-northeast and the town of Wehr to the southeast. It is located 2.5 km west of Erdmanns Cave (Hasler H√∂hle) in a shallow valley around 350 metres south of the Bundesstra√üe 518.  Geology and hydrology  Geologically it is a doline which is periodically filled with water, particularly after snowmelt or after long periods of rain when the groundwater level reaches the surface. In dry periods, the depth of the water table may be up to 40 metres; the deepest point of the groundwater- storing basin lies about 48 metres below the earth's surface. The background to the large variations in water level are the caverns of the Dinkelberg (which consists mainly of muschelkalk) which can fill very quickly with water, but only empty slowly.  Biology  The bed of the lake is colonised by rich herbaceous community of meadow flora. These may not be grazed or fertilised during dry periods. In the lake lives Tanymastix lacunae of the order of fairy shrimps (Anostraca). The drying out of the lake is essential for its life cycle. This is the only confirmed place in Germany where it is found; there are only seven other sites for the species in the whole of Europe.  History  The lake is first recorded in 1771, when five people were drowned in a capsized boat. People also lost their lives in the lake in 1876 and 1910. The first scientific description of the lake is probably the article Von einem merkw√ºrdigen See in der oberen Markgrafschaft Baden (\\"About a notable lake in the upper Margraviate of Baden\\") by Heinrich Sander, which appeared in 1782 in the magazine, Der Naturforscher. The lake has been protected since 1939 and, since 1983, has been designated a natural monument with an area of 3.75 hectares. In addition it is a Special Area of Conservation at European level.  Extent over time  In years when there is an especially heavy precipitation the (visible above ground) water level can rise to three meters and, within one to five weeks, the lake can reach a size of 250 metres long and 135 metres wide (c. 2.5 ha). It can take from 8 to 160 days for the water to disappear again.

Early Life He has been called a virtuoso on the Algerian mandole or mondol, \\"one of most gifted on this instrument very present in the Ch√¢abi music.\\" In France he has worked with other artists including, providing background music or participating in their bands, as well as arranging music for film and theater. The bands he has played with have played a wide mixture of music, including rap, ragga, reggae, jazz and ra√Ø. In addition to showing what the mondol can do, he also has showed the capabilities of other stringed instruments used in North Africa, including the banjo, oud, mandolin, sintir, guitar and la√∫d.  Biography Abdennour began playing stringed instruments at age 8, including mandolin, mondol, banjo and guitar. He met Amar Ezzahi, one of the masters of the Algerian cha√¢bi in 1983, when he was only 17 years old. Two years later, he began to work with him, playing banjo and performing. Working with the experienced musician gave him knowledge and experience and he refined his technique. It was during his studies with Ezzahi that he began to perfect his mandole playing. He left for Paris in the about 1994. That was a painful period called \\"Black Decade\\" during which Ezzahi decided not to sing anymore. Ptit Moh continued his path in music in Paris, playing oriental or eastern music for weddings and festivals. He played with Alabina, Chico and the Gypsies and Idir for the album Identit√©s, Safy Boutella and participated in film music. Amazigh Kateb asked him to join the band Gnawa Diffusion in 1999 for the album Bab El Oued Kingston. The band was from Grenoble, in the South-East of France, and played a mixture of rap, ragga, reggae, jazz, ra√Ø. He also participated in Desert Rebel's album Desert Rebel in 2006. He continued to play with Gnawa Diffusion until they disbanded in 2007, but played again with the lead vocalist Amazigh Kateb on his solo album March√© noir. He was still playing with Kateb in 2015 in trio that also included Karim Ziad in a jazz festival, in Shenzhen, China. After the breakup of Gnawa Diffusion, he drew upon his years of musical experience and began a solo project, called the \\"Ptit Moh Project\\". The music he creates under the project is a mixture of jazz, world music and chaabi. He played mandol and guitar in the theatrical work \\"Renayates\\", starring Houria A√Øchi in the spring of 2015. He not only played but arranged music for Malya Saadi's album \\"Ya Bhar\\" in 2013. Ptit Moh also worked on the last album of Idir, published in April 2017. In 2014, he played with the. flamenco, player, Juan Carmona in the Ibn Zeydoun hall in Alger and in the Cit√© de la Musique in Marseille This collaboration continues today; their music mixes cha√¢bi and flamenco. As a composer, he composed music for Medina, Gnawa Diffusion, and Chico and the Gypsies. Ptit Moh is the artistic director of the El Gusto Orchestra.

She is one of the first female poets who showed her feminist attitudes in her poetry. The book Mirror of Dew was the first translation of her poems into English. She died in 1947 in Iran.  Life  Zhaleh was born in 1883 in Farahan. She was the daughter of Gohar Malek and Mirza Fathollah. Mirza Fathollah was the great grandchild of Ghaemmagham Farhahi, the Iranian Prime Minister, briefly from 1834 to 1835. When Zhaleh was 5, she started learning reading Persian and Arabic, and studied other fields till 15. When she was 15, she moved to Tehran with her family in 1938. Her family forced her to marry her father's friend, Alimoradkhan Bakhtiari. Alimorad was working in the military. He was 40 years old. He had daughters from her ex-wife. When Zhaleh married him, the daughters were older than her. After their coercive marriage, Zhaleh gave birth to Hossein Pezhman Bakhtiari. After two or three years, Zhaleh got divorced. At first, Hossein lived with his father until he became 27. Then he lived with his mother till the end of his life. Asghar Seyed-Gohrab says, \\"Zhale was married off, at fifteen, to a man she loathed. The cultured and well-educated young woman was completely mismatched with the much older military man, who already had other wives. The death of her parents during the first year of her marriage, and the birth of a son, presumably compounded the trauma. She did then soon divorce the man.\\" After her divorce, Zhaleh continued living in Farahan. Her departure from her child had impacts on her emotions. Her feelings, depression, and gloomy life are all seen in her poems. Her personal hidden feelings are reflected in one of her poems about her son. So, subjectivity and womanhood were first founded in Zhaleh's poems. She finally died at the age of 63, at 1 P.M, 27 September, 1947. She was buried in Imamzadeh Hassan, in the west of Tehran. Zhaleh was one of the critical and idealistic female poets. When she was 23, the Persian Constitutional Revolution took place. During that period of time, the society held conservative views towards women, as well as their social activities. This made her portray her protesting voice against the submissive role of women in her poetry. This way, she helped women of her time get rid of the limitations. Her poetry was concerned about patriarchal society which suppressed women and deprived them of their rights.  Works  She was the first female poet who dared to talk about her personal problems. Her poetry was not published for many years. She wrote them for herself. Even she buried a noticeable number of her poems. After so many years, finally her son collected her poems and got them published. Asghar Seyed- Gohrab writes that she denied that she was a poet even though a few of her works were published in 1993. He suggests, \\"She might be called the Emily Dickinson of Persian poetry\\".1 Her poetry is mostly autobiographical, a reflection of the tragedies and hardships that she went through in her personal life. She aimed to describe her protest against those stereotypes, beliefs, and expectations with regards to defending women rights. In her poetry, she portrays women's struggles with inequality between the genders in terms of positions and rights. Zhaleh was an introspected poet; even though she lived in melancholy and gloomy situations, she wrote her poems while breaking the stereotypes and traditions about women. She hid her poetic skills during her life even from her son, Pezhman. As Pezhman puts, she lately spent her life reading books about Literature, History, and Astronaut. According to the researches in national magazines, there were a few or no researches about her works and poetry. Even the feminist scholars and researchers did not pay enough attention to her. However, among all the articles and researches, Maryam Khalili Jahantigh and Mahsa Ghadir wrote an article comparing Zhaleh and Emily Dickinson's life and poetry. Based on the article, there are similarities between the two poets in part of their life and experiences, as well as poetry.  List of some of her works  * Reproach to my Husband * Message to the Unborn * What Would Have Happened?  What Would Have Happened?  Below you can find a part of one of her poems translated into English and Persian. What Would Have Happened '' O mother, what would have happened if I had not gotten a husband? What would have happened if I had not gotten caught in misfortune? If a story-teller had told a tale about my ill fortune, I swear by that ill fortune, I would have not believed it. Was I such a heavy burden? Would my handful of bones Have bent my father‚Äôs back if I hadn‚Äôt gotten a husband? What would you say I was at the banquet spread of our family‚Äôs life?

It is the burial place of Potawatomi chief Wahbememe (White Pigeon), who died in approximately 1830. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The location is now the Wahbememe Memorial Park. Description The burial site of Wahbememe is on a low rise, located in a small park. It shares the park with memorials honoring fallen soldiers. The monument is eight feet tall, and consists of a granite boulder supported by a concrete base. The base is three blocks high, with a slanting cap transitioning from a wider, two-block high lower section to an upper section a single block high. One side of the boulder is smoothed, and carries the inscription: The base below carries the additional inscription: History Burial Site in 1909, with Willie White Pigeon In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Potawatomi controlled a large territory around the southern portion of Lake Michigan, including this area. Around the turn of the century, Wahbememe (White Pigeon) was the chief of a village located west of here, near the St. Joseph River, and was one of the signers of the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. During the War of 1812, when the Potawatomi alied with the British, Wahbememe reportedly served as a messenger between local Potawatomi bands and Main Poc and Tecumseh. He was captured by American forces in 1815. Nothing more is known about Wahbememe, save that he died some time before the first European settlers arrived in the White Pigeon area in 1827. (note: large pdf file) White Pigeon was the first permanent settlement in southern Michigan outside of Wayne and Washtenaw counties. The first settlers arrived in 1827, and White Pigeon Township was organized in 1829. That same year, a Mr. Earl claimed the lot of land on which this site is located, and was told by the Potawatomi that Wahbememe was buried there. Earl built a house at the location, and the Potawatomi promptly burned it leading Earl to build elsewhere and mark the spot with a poplar tree. Although the grave was a well- known landmark to the earliest settlers (indeed, the May 29, 1839, White Pigeon Republican contained a short story on the gravesite), a tradition arose that in about 1830 Wahbememe attended a council in the Detroit area, and, learning of a planned Indian attack on the White Pigeon settlement, ran straight to White Pigeon to warn the settlers. After arriving in time, he then collapsed and died. This story, although commemorated on the monument, is unlikely to be true, as Wahbememe's grave existed when White Pigeon was first settled. By 1877, the local populace considered erecting a monument at the grave site. Although there was some talk of doing so, nothing concrete occurred until 1909, when the Alba Columba Club, a White Pigeon women's club, raised funds to construct a monument. A boulder was hauled to the site, and the monument was unveiled on August 10, 1909, by six-year old Willie White Pigeon, a direct descendant of Wahbememe, in front of a crowd of over 4000 people. The monument, however, still stood on private property. In 1922, the owners, Albert G. and Claudia E. Wade, conveyed an easement on a small parcel to the St. Joseph County Board of Road Commissioners to create a park. The county created what is now the Wahbememe Memorial Park at the site. In 1986, the farm which the site was part of was parceled out to make an industrial park, and the new owners deeded the park property to the St. Joseph County Historical Society. The monument was rededicated on July 11, 1987.

His birth name was Mahmut Esat. But after the adaptation of the Turkish Surname Law in 1934, he chose the surname Bozkurt in remembrance of the Grey Wolf, a symbol for Turkdom. The surname also refers to Turkish steamer S.S. Bozkurt in Lotus case. Life Mahmut Esat was born to Hasan Bey of Hacƒ± Mahmutoƒüullarƒ± in Ku≈üadasƒ±, Aydƒ±n Vilayet during the Ottoman Empire era in 1892. He finished the idadi (high school) in ƒ∞zmir in 1908, and graduated from ƒ∞stanbul University's School of Law in 1912. He traveled to Fribourg, Switzerland for further studies. He completed his doctorate thesis Du r√©gime des capitulations ottomanes (\\"On the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire\\") with summa cum laude, \\"highest honor\\" at the University of Fribourg. In Lausanne, he served as the leader of the Turkish Student Association. In 1919, after Greek landing at Smyrna, he returned home to join the nationals in the Turkish War of Independence. He secretly traveled in an Italian ship, which was carrying ammunition to the Italian occupation troops in Anatolia. Although he was arrested by the Italians, he managed to escape. Politics He became a member of the Turkish parliament established on 23 April 1920. He held this post up to his death in 1943.

As Minister of Justice, he was member of the Reform Council for the East () who prepared the Report for Reform in the East () which recommended to resettlement of the Kurds and the prohibition of non-Turkish languages. It was Mahmut Esat, who introduced the Swiss Civil Code in Turkey in 1926. Mahmut Esat is known as the progenitor of Turkish civil code. The preamble of the code written by Mahmut Esat is considered to reflect the philosophy of Turkish Revolution. Later years After resigning from the post of Justice Minister, he became a professor at Ankara University and taught International law at the Law School and Constitutional law at the Faculty of Political Science. He authored the books Lotus Davasƒ±nda T√ºrkiye-Fransa M√ºdafaalarƒ± (1927), T√ºrk ƒ∞htilalinde Vatan M√ºdafaasƒ± (1934), T√ºrk K√∂yl√º ve ƒ∞≈ü√ßilerinin Haklarƒ± (1939), Devletlerarasƒ± Hak (1940), Atat√ºrk ƒ∞htilali (1940) and Aksak Timur‚Äôun Devlet Politikasƒ± (1943). He died from intracerebral hemorrhage in Istanbul on 21 December 1943. Lotus case Mahmut Esat was also known by his struggles in an international trial named the Lotus case. On 2 August 1926, a French streamship named S.S. Lotus collided on high seas with the Turkish steamer S.S. Boz-Kourt causing the death of eight Turkish seamen. As the lieutenant on watch duty of the French vessel was arrested by the Turkish government, French government accused Turkey in the Permanent Court of International Justice claiming that Turkey had no right to arrest any French person. The French side was represented in court by the renowned law professor Jules Basdevant. Mahmut Esat personally defended the Turkish position in court. The court rejected France's position.

Marivaux et al. announced in 2005 their discovery of fossils of two new species, Phileosimias kamali and Phileosimias brahuiorum, found in the Bugti Hills of Pakistan. They concluded that Phileosimias are almost certainly early simians. However, they felt the fossil evidence (primarily dental specimens) was insufficient to categorise them as Eosimiidae (along with other early simians) or whether they were sufficiently different to be placed into a separate group. The shapes of their molars and premolars differ from species already classified as Eosimidae. (Full text PDF) The two species are Phileosimias brahuiorum and Phileosimias kamali, which is slightly larger, but both are estimated to have weighed about 250 grams. They were extant during the Early Oligocene epoch.Tuttle, Russell H. (17-Feb-2014). Apes and Human Evolution, Harvard. .
