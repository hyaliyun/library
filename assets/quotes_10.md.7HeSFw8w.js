His gimmick was a Texan cowboy who entered World Wrestling Federation (WWF) rings to the sound of a bullwhip. Professional wrestling career =National Wrestling Alliance (1971‚Äì1987)= Heard started wrestling as Ron Bass in 1971 in the Gulf Coast territory. Throughout the 1970s, he performed primarily in National Wrestling Alliance territories. He was known as \\"Cowboy\\" Ron Bass, Sam Oliver Bass, and \\"Outlaw\\" Ron Bass, depending on which territory he was working at the time. In the early 1980s, he wrestled in Championship Wrestling from Florida and Jim Crockett Promotions, frequently teaming with Black Bart as The Long Riders in both promotions. He also teamed and feuded with Barry Windham in Florida. As a face he would feud with Angelo Mosca and Kendo Nagasaki. Bass would later turn heel after turning on Dusty Rhodes during a match where Bass was a special referee in a match against Harley Race, costing Rhodes the NWA title. Bass' feud with Barry Windham (over a saddle given to Bass by Dusty Rhodes) led to Windham losing a \\"loser-leaves-town\\" match to Bass and coming back to wrestle as the masked \\"Dirty Yellow Dog. \\" =World Wrestling Federation (1987‚Äì1989)= In 1987, Bass (using the \\"Outlaw\\" name) went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he voiced challenges to the likes of WWF champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake. Bass quickly settled into a role in the midcard position, wrestling against Hillbilly Jim, Lanny Poffo and Sam Houston. Later on he was part of the five-man team captained by The Honky Tonk Man at the inaugural Survivor Series pay-per-view on Thanksgiving Day 1987. He also participated in the very first Royal Rumble and the 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. He was eliminated at the latter event by the Junkyard Dog; a feud between the two began in the months after WrestleMania after Bass choked and dragged the Dog with his bullwhip, \\"Miss Betsy,\\" in a sneak attack on Wrestling Challenge. He also joined Gorilla Monsoon at the broadcast table one week on Wrestling Challenge to cover for Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, who was recovering from his storyline injury from Ken Patera. At the 1988 King of the Ring tournament, Bass qualified for the final after beating a young Shawn Michaels but was paid by Ted DiBiase to fake an injury.Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.162, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, Bass began a feud with Beefcake in August 1988, gouging Beefcake's head open with his spurs (\\"Bret\\" and \\"Bart\\") on an episode of Superstars of Wrestling; the attack caused Beefcake to miss his scheduled Intercontinental championship match against the Honky Tonk Man at the first SummerSlam event on August 29. Bass and Honky co-captained a five-man contingent against a team captained by Beefcake and the Ultimate Warrior at the second Survivor Series in November. Bass and teammate Greg Valentine were eliminated by Warrior in succession in the final minute of the match. On the January 7, 1989 Saturday Night's Main Event XIX, Bass lost to Beefcake via sleeperhold in a hair vs. hair match. He competed in the 1989 Royal Rumble (sans hair), Bass' feud with Beefcake was scrapped, and he was used mainly as a preliminary wrestler and left the WWF shortly thereafter. =Retirement= Bass wrestled in the independents before retiring in 1991 due to the injuries sustained over his career. In 2005, he made an appearance at WrestleReunion on January 29 and teamed with Larry Zbyszko to defeat Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda. Bass and Brian Blair both starred in the film Silent Times directed by Geoff Blanchette and Christopher Annino, which was released in 2018. Bass plays a 1920s professional football coach named Coach Joseph Arcarese. Personal life and death After retiring, Heard returned to Tampa, Florida, where he golfed, became religious, and earned his bachelor's degree from Arkansas State University. Subsequently, he worked in sales in Florida's construction market. He also became an Amway salesman in the Tampa area. He had one son. In July 2016, Heard was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. Following his death, in December 2018, Kyros' law firm received a postmortem report from the Heard family stating he had suffered from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has become common among professional wrestlers. Over a year after his death, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. In March 2017, Heard was hospitalized due to a burst appendix. He died on March 7 at the age of 68 due to complications following surgery.\\"Former professional wrestler ‚ÄòCowboy‚Äô Ron Bass dies at Tampa General Hospital\\", by WFLA Web Staff Championships and accomplishments *All Japan Pro Wrestling **NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Stan Hansen *Central States Wrestling **NWA Central States Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Ken Mantell *Championship Wrestling from Florida **NWA Florida Bahamian Championship (1 time) **NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Barry Windham **NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship (2 times) **NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Florida version) (2 times) **NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version) (4 times) - with Black Bart (3), and One Man Gang (1) *Georgia Championship Wrestling **NWA National Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling - Southeastern Championship Wrestling **NWA Gulf Coast Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Don Bass (1) and Dutch Bass (1) **NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division) (1 time) **NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Randy Rose **NWA Tennessee Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Don Bass *Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling / Jim Crockett Promotions **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Mid-Atlantic version) (1 time) **NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Black Bart **NWA Television Championship (1 time) *NWA Hollywood Wrestling **NWA Americas Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Dr. Hiro Ota (1), Moondog Lonnie Mayne (1), and Roddy Piper (1) *NWA Mid-America / Continental Wrestling Association **AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (2 times) **AWA Southern Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Stan Lane **NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (1 time) - with Don Bass *NWA Tri-State **NWA Arkansas Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Pacific Northwest Wrestling **NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with John Anson (1) and Moondog Mayne (1) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him # 294 of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the \\"PWI Years\\" in 2003. *Ring Around The Northwest Newsletter **Wrestler of the Year (1977) References External links *Ron Bass biography at WWE's Where are they Now? page Category:1948 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Arkansas State University alumni Category:Deaths from appendicitis Category:NWA/WCW World Television Champions Category:People from Harrisburg, Arkansas Category:People from Pampa, Texas Category:People with traumatic brain injuries Category:Professional wrestlers from Arkansas Category:The Heenan Family members ","title":"Ron Bass (wrestler)"},{"id":"2187029","text":"Ludwig Ganghofer (7 July 1855 ‚Äì 24 July 1920) was a German writer who became famous for his homeland novels. Biography He was born in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, the son of forestry official August Ganghofer (1827‚Äì1900). His younger sister Ida (1863‚Äì1944) married the geologist and geographer Albrecht Penck in 1886, the geomorphologist Walther Penck was Ganghofer's nephew. He graduated from gymnasium secondary school in 1873 and subsequently worked as a fitter in Augsburg engine works. In 1875, he entered Munich Polytechnic as a student of mechanical engineering, but eventually changed his major to history of literature and philosophy, which subjects he studied in Munich, Berlin and Leipzig. In 1879, he was awarded a doctorate from the Leipzig University. Ganghofer wrote his first play \\"Der Herrgottschnitzer von Ammergau\\" (The Crucifix Carver of Ammergau) in 1880 for the Munich G√§rtnerplatz Theatre, where it was given 19 performances. But his breakthrough was a guest performance of this play in Berlin, where it was staged more than 100 times. Subsequently, Ganghofer worked as dramaturge at the Ringtheater in Vienna (1881), as a freelance writer for the family paper Die Gartenlaube and as a feuilleton editor of the Neues Wiener Tagblatt (1886‚Äì1891). In Vienna, Ganghofer was a frequent guest at the salon in the Palais Todesco, where he met with artists like Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Johann Strauss. From 1891, he worked mainly as a writer of Alpine novels, inspired by the sojourns at his hunting lodge near Leutasch in Tyrol; but he also produced e.g. Hugo von Hofmannsthal's play \\"Der Tor und der Tod\\". He also founded the Munich Literary Society. His work as a voluntary war correspondent from 1915 and 1917 is less known. During those years, he wrote ‚Äì besides propagandistic war reports e.g. \\"Reise zur deutschen Front\\" (Travel to the German frontlines) ‚Äì a large number of patriotic war poems, which were published in collections like \\"Eiserne Zither\\" (Iron Zither) and \\"Neue Kriegslieder\\" (New War Songs). Being a personal friend of Emperor Wilhelm II and his favourite poet, Ganghofer's war reports frequently lauded the emperor and Paul von Hindenburg and their conduct of the war. Until shortly before the German capitulation, he continued to publish calls not to give up fighting. He was seriously wounded in the war and was awarded the Iron Cross. In 1917 he and his friend Ludwig Thoma joined the far-right German Fatherland Party which was dissolved in the Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, and his political activities ceased. Heavily criticised by colleagues like Karl Kraus, readings of his militaristic works provided him with an above average income. After the end of the war, Ganghofer returned to his profession as a writer. He dedicated his last work \\"Das Land der Bayern in Farbenphotographie\\" (The country of Bavaria in coloured photography) to \\"His Majesty King Ludwig III of Bavaria in deepest reverence\\". Shortly afterwards, Ganghofer died in Tegernsee. Ganghofer's works, in particular his novels, are still published nowadays. By 2004, it is estimated that more than 30 million copies of his works had been sold. Besides, among German authors Ganghofer's works have been some of the most frequently adapted as films, starting with silent films in the 1910s and 1920s, and continuing during the Heimatfilm era after World War II. His homeland novels earned Ganghofer the reputation as a \\"healthy world\\" writer. His works which describe the life of simple, competent, honest people are often seen as kitsch ‚Äì not least because most of them are staged against the background of an idyllic Bavarian Alps scenery.

History It debuted in System 7.5, but disappeared in Mac OS 8, when the feature was implemented as a part of the Appearance Manager. A widget was added to the title bar in addition to the double-click method of collapsing a window. The entire feature disappeared with the release of Mac OS X; windows could be minimized to the Dock on the new system or, starting with Mac OS X 10.3, moved aside with Expos√©. However, several third-party utilities, such as WindowShade X for Unsanity's Application Enhancer software, have brought the ability back to Mac OS. It has since reappeared as a commercial haxie and offers other features, like translucent windows and minimize-in-place. WindowShade X from Unsanity stopped working in Mac OS 10.7, and other third-party developers have since released applications such as WindowMizer from RGB World that keep the WindowShade feature working on Mac OS X 10.6 and greater. The WindowShade control panel itself stems from a third-party utility originally written for System 6.0.7 by Rob Johnston. Apple purchased the rights to this software from the developer for use in System 7.5. Other operating systems Some window managers for Unix-like operating systems have a similar feature allowing windows to be set to \\"roll up\\" when the user double-clicks the title bar of a window. Some window managers provide a titlebar button to access the functionality. While Microsoft Windows does not expose such a feature by default, in some versions if a window is minimized while no taskbar is available, the said window will become a \\"shade\\" at the bottom of the screen.

Born in Nafpaktos, he obtained his law degree from the University of Athens. He was first elected to the Greek Parliament in 1926 representing his native prefecture of Aetolia-Acarnania, and was repeatedly elected to office until 1964. A lawyer by trade, he served as Minister for the Interior in 1945, Minister for Education in 1950 and Minister for Industry in 1951. In 1961, however, he was one of many conservatives who joined the Center Union (EK), in opposition to the corruption of right-wing governments at the time. In 1964, after EK came into power, he became Speaker of the Greek Parliament. On July 15, 1965 he was appointed Prime Minister of Greece by king Constantine II, after the latter dismissed Georgios Papandreou, a move that is known as Apostasia of 1965. He was followed by many EK conservatives and with support from conservative National Radical Union MPs tried to form a government, but failed to get past a vote of confidence in parliament. He was replaced on August 20 of the same year. In July 1974 he was one of the politicians who brokered the end of the Regime of the Colonels and the appointment of Constantine Karamanlis as Prime Minister. Athanasiadis-Novas also wrote some poetry and prose under the pen name Georgios Athanas (ŒìŒµœéœÅŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÇ).National Book Centre, Profile of Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas Literary critics found very little in the way of value in his works, but he found some popularity among his detractors, who used them to ridicule his less-than- distinguished political career. The stanza: :Itan ta stithia sou :aspra san galata :kai mou 'leges: :gargala ta ::Your breasts were ::White as milk ::And you urged me ::\\"Tickle them!\\" gained him the comical nickname \\"Gargalatas\\", Tickler. Only after 40 years has it been proven that the fact that he wrote this stanza was an urban legend. It all started from an article of Costas Stamatiou at the newspaper Ta Nea, with the intention to ridicule him. Lefteris Papadopoulos cleared up the situation with an article at the same newspaper in 2004. He died in Athens on August 10, 1987, aged 94.

CLP Academic, 2012, pxix. Life He was born the son of a noble lawyer and historian, in Alzano Lombardo near Bergamo. His father died in the plague of 1528 and his mother died only three years later. At age 15 he entered the monastery of the Augustinian Order of Regular Canons, where he studied Aristotle, languages and divinity. After completing his studies, he went to Lucca, and there under the influence of Peter Martyr Vermigli he opted for a theological career, being especially impressed by Vermigli's lectures on Romans. In addition to works of the Fathers, he became aware of Martin Bucer and Philipp Melanchthon, also read Martin Luther's writings and the Swiss reformers. John Calvin, however, had the greatest influence on him. Even after Vermigli‚Äôs forced flight in 1542, Zanchi remained as a teacher of Greek at the monastery school.Girolamo Zanchi, On the Law in General. CLP Academic, 2012, p.xxiii. In 1551, however, he also was forced into exile. After a brief stay in Geneva, he wanted to go to England, but was called to Strasbourg and worked there as a professor of the Old Testament at the college of St. Thomas. His style is legalistic, and he interpreted with meticulous accuracy. In his overall theological orientation, he has been described as \\"a Calvinist in terms of theological content, and a Thomist in terms of philosophy and methodology.\\"Girolamo Zanchi, On the Law in General. CLP Academic, 2012, p.xxii. He was one of the most learned theologians of the second half of the 16th Century, if he is not considered to be an especially original thinker. He was regarded an excellent teacher. He married a daughter of Caelius Secundus Curio. The demand for Strasbourg faculty and pastors to commit themselves to the Augsburg Confession created difficulties for him. He had previously declined offers to move to Geneva and Lausanne because he was committed to Strasbourg. However, he could not remain after the controversy with the Lutheran superintendent Johann Marbach. Zanchi had described the differences in the doctrine of the Eucharist between the Lutheran and Reformed as being relatively minor and also taught a strict Calvinist doctrine of predestination. After receiving many consultations from theologians outside of Strasbourg, the disputing parties were able to reach an agreement in constructing a formula of unity (The Strasbourg Consensus) signed by all the city's preachers and professors. When Calvin chided him for his equivocation, Zanchi went public with his views again causing the controversy to erupt anew. He consequently left from Strasbourg to become the pastor of the Italian Protestant congregation in the Graub√ºnden in Chiavenna. In 1568 he received a call to the University of Heidelberg, where he took over the chair of Dogmatics formerly occupied by Zacharias Ursinus. Here he wrote important works which tend to bear either an apologetic or polemical character. His method of presentation is quite scholastic. After the Electorate of the Palatinate returned to Lutheranism during the reign of Elector Ludwig VI, Zanchi moved with many other Reformed professors to the Casmirianum, a Reformed academy in Neustadt in the dominions of Count Palatine Johann Casimir. He died during a return visit to Heidelberg and was buried in the University Church. Thought Zanchius was a voluminous writer whose works include Confession of the Christian Religion and Observation on the Divine Attributes. His The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination is still in publication today. His Operum theologicorum has also been extremely influential. One chapter from this work has been called \\"the Protestant equivalent of Aquinas's Treatise on Law,\\"Girolamo Zanchi, On the Law in General . CLP Academic, 2012, p.xxv. and has recently been translated into English and published as On the Law in General (2012). In this work, Zanchius repeatedly references natural law, arguing that its authority is equal to that of the Decalogue: \\"Because the Decalogue defines and describes the same things that are called natural law, the Ten Commandments themselves are often called 'natural law.'. . . It must be mentioned that just as Christ is the fulfillment of the entire Mosaic law, so, too, is he the fulfillment of natural law because, as human beings are convicted of sin through the law, they flee to Christ for forgiveness.\\"Girolamo Zanchi, On the Law in General. CLP Academic, 2012, pp.24-25. While his debt to Aquinas is evident throughout the Operum theologicorum, he parts with Aquinas's conception of natural law due to disagreement in interpreting Romans 2:14-15. Zanchi argues that natural law should be seen as moral knowledge that God has universally and directly ‚Äúreinscribed‚Äù on the human mind after the Fall, rather than as a \\"relic of the original image of God‚Äù or some ‚Äúessential part of human nature.\\" Girolamo Zanchi, On the Law in General. CLP Academic, 2012, p.17. Epitaph The following is a translation of the inscription on the headstone of Zanchius' grave: Here Zanchius rests, whom love of truth constrained to quit his own and seek a foreign land. How good and great he was, how formed to shine, How fraught with science human and divine; Sufficient proof his numerous writings give, And those who heard him teach and saw him live. Earth still enjoys him, though his soul has fled: His name is deathless, though his dust is dead.

In real property law, the juristic term real covenants means conditions tied to the ownership or use of land. A \\"covenant running with the land\\", meeting tests of wording and circumstances laid down in precedent, imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified;\\"Integration of the Law of Easements, Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes\\". Washington Law Review. in the US the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes.Hernandez MV. (2005). \\"Restating Implied, Prescriptive, and Statutory Easements\\". Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal. Real covenant law in the US has been referred to as an \\"unspeakable quagmire\\" by one court.Lucas D. (2004). \\"There is a Porn Store in Mr. Roger's Neighborhood: Will You Be Their Neighbor? How to Apply Residential Use Restrictive Covenants to Modern Home Businesses\\". Campbell Law Review. Covenants for title are covenants which come with a deed or title to the property, in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the grantee. Non-compete clauses in the United States are also called restrictive covenants. Landlords may seek and courts may grant forfeiture of leases such as in leasehold estates for breach of covenant, which in most jurisdictions must be relatively severe breaches; however, the covenant to pay rent is one of the more fundamental covenants. The forfeiture of a private home involves interference with social and economic human rights. In the case of leases commuted to a large sum payable at the outset (a premium), this has prompted lobbying for and government measures of leasehold reform particularly in the law of ground rents and service charges. __FORCETOC__ Related to land In property law, land-related covenants are called \\"real covenants\\" and are a major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions on how the land may be used (negative covenants) or requiring a certain continuing action (affirmative covenant). These may also \\"run with the land\\" (called a covenant appurtenant), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person (called a covenant in gross or of a purely personal nature).Covenant. (2008). West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. Retrieved August 7, 2009, from http://legal- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Covenant. Under English law, affirmative covenants typically do not run with the land; in the United States such covenants are examined more closely, but with exceptions affirmative covenants have been permitted to run with the land.New York has been one such exception; see Nicholson v. 300 Broadway Realty Corp., 7 NY 2d 240 - NY: Court of Appeals 1959. The covenant may be shown in the deed and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; it may also be recorded, or in the case of Commonwealth countries shown in Torrens title. Real covenants and easements or equitable servitudes are similarSchnably. Easements, Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes. and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of easements, equitable servitudes, and real covenants should be unified. As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.Expanded outline on covenants Harvard Law School. Covenants may be imposed through homeowner associations, and controversy has arisen over selective enforcement.Neighbors At War!, by Ward Lucas; Hogback Publishing (2012). Historically, particularly in the United States, exclusionary covenants were used to exclude racial minorities. Some covenants exist for safety purposes, such as a covenant forbidding the construction of tall buildings in the vicinity of an airport or one restricting the height of fences/shrubs at street corners (so as not to interfere with drivers' sight lines). Covenants may restrict everything from the height and size of buildings to the materials used in construction to superficial matters such as paint color and holiday decorations. In residential areas, covenants may forbid \\"dirty\\" businesses (such as feedlots or chemical production facilities) or business use entirely, or modifications such as amateur radio antenna. Amateur radio restrictions have been particularly controversial; in 1985 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission issued PRB-1 preempting state and local restrictions, but not private restrictions; in 2012 after Congress passed a law requiring study of this issue (at the urging of amateur radio group ARRL), the FCC declined to extend this preemption. Some US states have enacted legislation requiring homeowners' associations to provide reasonable accommodations for amateur radio antennas under the rationale that amateur radio provides public service communications in the event of an emergency, major disaster, or special event. In Canada, governmental authorities may use restrictive covenants as well as zoning. For instance, the city of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of Calgary International Airport be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant of the city as a restrictive covenant, not as a zoning by-law. =Requirements in US Law= The covenant will typically be written in the deed, and must be in writing due to the statute of frauds. Although scholars have argued that some of the following should be significantly relaxed, in order for the burden to run with the land the following must apply:Ch. 33 Real Covenants. LexisNexis Study Outline. * The covenant must be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. * The original parties to the agreement must have intended that successors be bound by the agreement. * A subsequent owner must have had actual notice, inquiry notice, or constructive notice (record) of the covenant at the time of purchase. * The covenant must touch or concern the land. The covenant must relate to the use or enjoyment of the land. * There must be horizontal privity between the original parties. ** Horizontal privity is found if, at the time the original parties enter into the agreement, those parties share some interest in the subject land independent of the covenant (e.g., landlord and tenant, mortgagee and mortgagor, or holders of mutual easements). Individual state statutes can alter the requirements of horizontal privity of estate. Privity may be instantaneous and mutual; instantaneous privity is present when the restrictive covenant is within the deed initially conveyed from the grantor to the grantee. * There must be strict vertical privity of estate. ** Vertical privity characterizes the relationship between the original party to the covenant and the subsequent owner. To be bound by the covenant, the successor must hold the entire estate in land held by the original party (strict vertical privity of estate). Note that because strict vertical privity is required for a burden to run, a lessee could not have a burden enforced against them. However, a benefited party could sue the owner of the reversion of the estate, and the owner could possibly sue the lessee for waste. =Enforcement and modification= Courts interpret covenants relatively strictly and give the words of the agreement their ordinary meaning. Generally if there is any unclear or ambiguous language regarding the existence of a covenant courts will favor free alienation of the property. Courts will not read any restrictions on the land by implication (as is done with easements for example). A covenant can be terminated if the original purpose of the covenant is lost. In some cases property owners can petition a court to remove or modify the covenants, and homeowner associations may include procedures for removing the covenants. The covenant may be negative or affirmative. A negative covenant is one in which property owners are unable to perform a specific activity, such as block a scenic view. An affirmative covenant is one in which property owners must actively perform a specific activity, such as keeping the lawn tidy or paying homeowner's association dues for the upkeep of the surrounding area. An agreement not to open a competing business on adjacent property is generally enforceable as a covenant running with the land. However, under the federal Supreme Court's holding in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), a covenant that restricts sale to a minority person (commonly used during the Jim Crow era) is unenforceable, as enforcement would require the court to act in a racially discriminatory manner, contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. =England and Wales= At common law, the benefit of a restrictive covenant runs with the land if three conditions are met:Gray et al., Property Law in New South Wales, second edition, p547 * The covenant must not be personal in nature - it must benefit the land rather than an individual * The covenant must 'touch and concern' the land - it must affect how the land is used or the value of the land * The benefited land must be identifiable. At common law, the burden of a restrictive covenant does not runAusterberry v Oldham Corporation (1885) 29 Ch D 750 except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists. The burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. The rule in Halsall v Brizell is limited to cases where the benefit can be linked to a specific burden and where the covenantor's successors in title can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the covenantor's successors in title have no legal right to use them.Thamesmead Town Ltd v Allotey (2000) 79 P & CR 557) A positive burden can run in law, but not in equity, as it is deemed to be analogous to a contract, to which equitable principles do not apply (Rhone v Stephens (1994)). The burden of a restrictive covenant will run in equity if these prerequisites are met:Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 41 ER 1143) * The burden cannot be a positive burden (that is, it requires expenditure to meet it); * The purchaser must have notice of the covenant * The covenant must benefit the covenantee's land * The covenant must be intended to run with the covenantor's land. The leading case of restrictive covenants in equity is generally regarded as that of Tulk v Moxhay in which it was determined that the burden could run in equity subject to the qualifications listed above. =In planned communities= In contemporary practice in the United States, a covenant typically refers to restrictions set on contracts like deeds of sale. \\"Covenants, conditions, and restrictions,\\" commonly abbreviated \\"CC&Rs;\\" or \\"CCRs\\", are a complicated system of covenants, known generically as \\"deed restrictions,\\" built into the deeds of all the lots in a common interest development, particularly in the tens of millions of American homes governed by a homeowner association (HOA) or condominium association. There are some office or industrial parks subject to CCRs as well. These CCRs might, for example, dictate the types of structures that can be built (e.g. a CCR may prohibit any type of modular, prefabricated, or mobile home, and/or may require the structure to be a minimum size), appearance (e.g. no junk cars), or other uses (e.g. no operation of home-based business, no pets except traditional household animals). The purpose of this is to maintain a neighborhood character or prevent improper use of the land. Many covenants of this nature were imposed in the United States in the 1920s through the 1940s, before zoning became widespread. However, many modern developments are also restricted by covenants on property titles; this is often justified as a means of preserving the values of the houses in the area. Covenant restrictions can be removed through court action, although this process is lengthy and often very expensive. In some cases it even involves a plebiscite of nearby property owners. Although control of such planning issues is often governed by local planning schemes or other regulatory frameworks rather than through the use of covenants, there are still many covenants imposed, particularly in states that limit the level of control over real property use that may be exercised by local governments. =Exclusionary covenants= A Florida subdivision plat from 1926 with a racially-discriminatory deed restriction: \\"At no time shall the land included in said tract ... be occupied by any negro or person of negro extraction\\". Covenants often exclude certain classes based on race, religion or ethnicity. These groups are generally marginalized groups  United States  In the United States, deed restrictions and restrictive covenants became an important instrument for enforcing racial segregation in many towns and cities, becoming widespread in the 1920s and proliferating until they were declared unconstitutional in 1948. They prohibited a buyer of real property from allowing use or occupancy by members of a given race, ethnic origin, and/or religion as specified in the title deed. Such covenants were employed by many real estate developers to \\"protect\\" entire subdivisions, with the primary intent to keep \\"white\\" neighbourhoods \\"white\\". Ninety percent of the housing projects built in the years following World War II were racially restricted by such covenants. Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Seattle, and St. Louis. Often the restrictions applied only to African Americans wishing to buy property or rent a house or apartment, but other populations might also be banned, such as Asian-Americans, Jews, Indians, and Latinos. For example, a restrictive covenant covering a large neighborhood in Seattle declared that \\"no part of said property hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic Race\\", thus banning Jews and anyone of African, Filipino, or Asian ancestry. The exclusionary language varied widely. Some neighborhoods were reserved for the \\"White or Caucasian race\\". Others enumerated banned populations. One subdivision near Seattle specified that \\"This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race.\\" The Lake Shore Club District in Pennsylvania sought to exclude various minorities, including \\"Negroes,\\" \\"Mongolians\\", Hungarians, Mexicans, Greeks, and various other European ethnicities. Some covenants, such as those tied to properties in Forest Hills Gardens, New York, also sought to exclude working class people; however this type of social segregation was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements, and application reference checks.Fogelson, Robert M. (2005). Bourgeois Nightmares: Suburbia 1870‚Äì1930. New Haven: Yale University Press. =History= Racial covenants emerged during the mid-19th century and started to gain prominence from the 1890s onwards. It was not until the 1920s that they gained widespread national significance, and continued to spread through the 1940s. Racial covenants were an alternative to racially restrictive zoning ordinances (residential segregation based on race), which the 1917 US Supreme Court ruling of Buchanan v. Warley invalidated on constitutional grounds.Correa- Jones, M. (2000). The Origins and Diffusion of Racial Restrictive Covenants. Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 115, No. 4, p. 543.Meyer, Stephen G. (2000). As long as they don't move next door: segregation and racial conflict in American neighborhoods. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield. During the 1920s, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) sponsored several unsuccessful legal challenges against racial covenants. In a blow to campaigners against racial segregation, the legality of racial restrictive covenants was affirmed by the landmark Corrigan v. Buckley judgment ruling that such clauses constituted \\"private action\\" not subject to the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"1920s‚Äì1948: Racially Restrictive Covenants\\". The Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston. This cleared the way for racial restrictive covenants to proliferate across the US during the 1920s and 1930s. Even the invalidation of such a covenant by the US Supreme Court in the 1940 case of Hansberry v. Lee did little to reverse the trend, because the ruling was based on a technicality and failed to set a legal precedent. It was not until 1948 that the Shelley v. Kraemer judgment overturned the Corrigan v. Buckley decision, stating that exclusionary covenants were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable.\\"1948: Shelley v. Kraemer\\". The Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston.Jeffrey D. Gonda (2015). Unjust Deeds: The Restrictive Covenant Cases and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement. University of North Carolina Press. Some commentators have attributed the popularity of exclusionary covenants at this time as a response to the urbanization of black Americans following World War I, and the fear of \\"black invasion\\" into white neighborhoods, which residents felt would result in depressed property prices, increased nuisance (crime), and social instability. Many African Americans openly defied these covenants and attempted to \\"pioneer\\" restricted areas. In 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) which outlawed housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1988, it was expanded to prohibit discrimination based on familial status (e.g. the presence of children) or disability. Exclusionary covenants today Although exclusionary covenants are not enforceable today, they still exist in many original property deeds as \\"underlying documents\\", and title insurance policies often contain exclusions preventing coverage of such restrictions. It is not always easy to remove them from the chain of title. Since 2010, the Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project has located more than 500 restrictive covenants and deeds covering more than 20,000 properties in Seattle and its suburbs. In response, the Washington State legislature passed a law that since January 1, 2019 allows property owners to \\"modify\\" property records, disavowing the offensive restriction. Mapping Inequality, a collaboration of three teams at four universities, has identified restrictive covenants in various parts of the United States. The Mapping Prejudice project at the University of Minnesota has collected restrictive covenants in the Minneapolis area. =Examples in U.S.= * Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, New York ‚Äì covenants forbade the sale of real property to blacks, Jews, and working-class people. * Jackson Heights, Queens, New York ‚Äì covenants employed to restrict occupancy to white, non-immigrant Protestants.Miyares, Ines M.

Opposition to exclusionary covenants was significant in Canada, culminating in the 1945 Re Drummond Wren ruling by the Ontario High Court which invalidated their use. This judgment was influential in guiding similar decisions in the United States and elsewhere.Walker, James W. St. G. (1997). Race, rights and the law in the Supreme Court of Canada: historical case studies. Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. pp204-205. * France ‚Äì During World War II, under the Vichy regime in the Free Zone outside the Nazi occupied area, some condominiums inserted clauses forbidding selling to Jews. * South Africa ‚Äì racial covenants emerged in Natal during the 1890s as an attempt to prevent Indians from acquiring properties in more expensive areas, and were commonplace across the country by the 1930s. They were later used as a tool to further the cause of apartheid against the black population.Christopher, A. J. (2001). The Atlas of Changing South Africa. 2nd Edition. London: Routledge. p181. * Zimbabwe ‚Äì Asians and coloured people were excluded from purchasing or occupying homes in European areas by restrictive racial covenants written into most title deeds.Baker, Donald G. (1983). Race, ethnicity, and power. London: Routledge. p109. =Title covenants= Title covenants serve as guarantees to the recipient of property, ensuring that the recipient receives what he or she bargained for. ;Outside of England and Wales Outside of England and Wales the English covenants of title, sometimes included in deeds to real property, are (1) that the grantor is lawfully seized (in fee simple) of the property, (2) that the grantor has the right to convey the property to the grantee, (3) that the property is conveyed without encumbrances (this covenant is frequently modified to allow for certain encumbrances), (4) that the grantor has done no act to encumber the property, (5) that the grantee shall have quiet possession of the property, and (6) that the grantor will execute such further assurances of the land as may be requisite (Nos. 3 and 4, which overlap significantly, are sometimes treated as one item).E.g., Richmond v. Hall, 251 Va. 151, 160, 466 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1996). The English covenants may be described individually, or they may be incorporated by reference, as in a deed granting property \\"with general warranty and English covenants of title... ;In England and Wales Since 1989 the main covenants implied in England and Wales, on \\"limited\\" or \\"full title guarantee\\" are, (unless expressly overridden)Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 8(1): #that the person making the disposition has the right (with the concurrence of any other person conveying the property) to dispose of the property as he purports to, andLaw of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(1)(a) #that that person will at his own cost do all that he reasonably can to give the person to whom he disposes of the property the title he purports to give.Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(1)(b) #[In the case of a disposition of an existing legal interest] (a) where the title to the interest is registered, it shall be presumed that the disposition is of the whole of that interest; (b) [if unregistered and not leasehold, then the presumption it is of the fee simple]Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(3) #[If involving a lease] (a) that the lease is subsisting at the time of the disposition,Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 4(1)(a) and ::(b) that there is no subsisting breach of a condition or tenant‚Äôs obligation, and nothing which at that time would render the lease liable to forfeiture.Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 4(1)(b) Others as to charges, incumbrances, and third-party rights vary depending on whether full or limited title guarantee is agreed.Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 3 See also *Private transfer fee Footnotes Further reading * Richard R.W.

NRA Precision Pistol, formerly known as NRA Conventional Pistolrulebooks.nra.org/documents/pdf/compete/rules/rul_precision_pistol_15.pdf, is a national bullseye shooting discipline organized in the United States by NRA. Emphasis is on accuracy and precision, and participants shoot handguns at paper targets at fixed distances and time limits. Other organizations in the United States and Canada have established rules and keep records of similar disciplines, including the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) in the United States, . Bullseye pistol was the inspiration for the ISSF international 25 m Standard Pistol (82 feet) event and like the ISSF pistol events, the development of skills required to shoot one-handed at and bullseye targets at , respectively, takes considerable training to achieve proficiency.  Courses of fire  All courses of fire are from a standing position using a one-handed grip at two different targets depending on the distance and type of match. The slow-fire targets have the 8‚Äì10 rings inside the bullseye and the rapid fire targets have only the 9, 10 and X rings inside the black. Depending on the match format, the competitor may be required to shoot as many as 90 rounds using as many as three different handguns. Each shot scores a maximum of 10 points. Hence, a one-gun competition is often referred to as a \\"900\\" whereas a three-gun competition is a \\"2700\\". A shorter form is the National Match Course consisting of a single Slow Fire, a Timed and a Rapid Fire target, 30 shots for a maximum score of 300. Single gun competitions using only the rimfire pistol are common, as they provide an inexpensive entry into the sport. Outdoor competitions are typically fired at for slow fire courses and for timed and rapid fire courses. A \\"short course\\" shoots only at 25 yards and uses a reduced-size target for the Slow Fire segment. All courses of fire at an indoor competition are typically fired at with appropriately scaled targets. A notable exception to this rule of thumb happens at the Oak Harbor (Ohio) Conservation Club at 50/25 yards and Amarillo (Texas) Rifle Pistol Club at 25 yards which conducts indoor matches monthly through the fall, winter and spring. An example outdoor 900 match would include: * 2 strings of slow fire. Each string consists of 10 shots at 50 yards at a NRA B6 target. The bullseye diameter is * 1 National Match Course consisting of one 10-shot slow fire string at 50 yards, two 5-shot strings of timed fire at 25 yards, and two 5-shot strings of rapid fire at 25 yards. * 4 strings of timed fire. Each string consists of 5 shots in 20 seconds at 25 yards at a NRA B8 target. The bullseye diameter is . * 4 strings of rapid fire. Each string consists of 5 shots in 10 seconds at 25 yards at a NRA B8 target. The bullseye diameter is 5.5 inches.  Equipment rules  Bullseye specifies three classes of pistol; a .22 caliber rimfire, a centerfire handgun of .32 caliber or greater; and a .45 caliber pistol. Since the format includes a sustained fire stage, a semi- automatic pistol or revolver with a capacity of at least 5 rounds is needed. = Handgun types = While most moderately priced rimfire pistols are suitable for bullseye competition (the Ruger MK II or Ruger MK III being a common starting gun) the Smith & Wesson Model 41, 1911 22LR conversions, and the H√§mmerli 208 dominate the top levels of rimfire competition. The most common centerfire pistol is the M1911 design, usually built and accurized by a gunsmith. While many shooters use the M1911 for the centerfire stages of competition, some shooters prefer a third gun. European models such as .32 S&W; automatics from Walther, the now discontinued Smith & Wesson Model 52, and others are common, as are M1911 variants in smaller calibers, such as .32 ACP, 380ACP, .38 Special, 9mm, or .38 Super. One advantage of .45 caliber over .38 caliber is that the larger diameter hole made will be able cut a higher scoring ring over the smaller caliber given the same point of impact near the higher ring. Smith & Wesson revolvers are most common among shooters who prefer revolvers; S&W; makes revolvers in .22 Long Rifle, .38 Special, and .45 ACP. Custom gunsmithing is common here as well to increase reliability and usability all leading to improved accuracy. = Sights = Any type of sight can be used, except laser sights. Many competitors use iron sights, but the recent trend has been towards red dot sights, which many shooters find easier to use. Telescopic sights, while legal, are rare, as magnification is not considered an advantage. Iron sights are usually adjustable Patridge type sights, carefully treated to reduce glare that might impact sight alignment. = Ammunition = For the rimfire pistol, shooters use high quality target grade ammunition, ideally purchased in bulk so all ammunition comes from the same manufacturing lot, since even minor changes can result in changing point of impact. Relatively low velocity ammunition (always below the speed of sound) is preferred for precision Bullseye target shooting in both the slow and sustained fire disciplines because the .22 bullet can travel at or near the speed of sound. If a bullet transitions between supersonic speed and subsonic speed before striking the target, its flight path is slightly disturbed, reducing precision. To avoid this phenomenon, strictly subsonic ammunition is preferred. Centerfire ammunition is often handloaded, with very careful selection of components so maximum precision can be obtained. Lighter weight bullets and lower velocities are often selected to minimize recoil and improve precision. For any given handgun or rifle there is an optimum combination that delivers the peak or maximum possible accuracy.  Matches  The annual National Rifle and Pistol Matches take place at Camp Perry, Ohio in July and August. Competing shooters are registered with the National Rifle Association and scores are officially recorded. Registered matches (Regional, Sectional, and State championships and local matches) are held at various locations throughout the year and are often sponsored by local shooting clubs. Authorized matches are also recognized by the NRA. Scores at all of these competitions are recorded by the NRA and used to rank a shooter's abilities.  Records  While perfect scores have been shot in individual stages, no shooter has ever scored a 2700 in a sanctioned match. The current record is 2680-159x, set on July 24, 1974, by Hershel Anderson, with 159 of 270 shots hitting the \\"X\\" ring. Former US Marine Brian Zins holds the record of most NRA championships with 12, as of 2013.

It was considered a symbol of creation there. In Ancient Greece, it was a symbol of innocence and modesty. The Egyptian lotus is the national flower of Egypt. It is also an element of the Coptic flag. Claire Waight Keller included the flower to represent Malawi in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country.https://www.royal.uk/wedding-dress- bridesmaids%E2%80%99-dresses-and-page-boys-uniforms =As food= In some parts of Africa the rhizomes and tubers are eaten for the starch they contain either boiled, roasted or ground to a flour after drying. The young fruits are sometimes consumed as a salad. The seeds are turned into a meal. The tubers or the seeds are used as a famine food in India. =The white lotus in Ancient Egypt= White lotus decorations. Frieze at a palace in Amarna (1352-1336 BC) The ancient Egyptians cultivated the white lotus in ponds and marshes. This flower often appears in ancient Egyptian decorations. They believed that the lotus flower gave them strength and power; remains of the flower have been found in the burial tomb of Ramesses II. Egyptian tomb paintings from around 1500 BC provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental horticulture and landscape design; they depict lotus ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of acacias and palms. In Egyptian mythology Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a lotus with his mother. The lotus was one of the two earliest Egyptian capitals motifs, the topmost members of a column. At that time, the motifs of importance are those based on the lotus and papyrus plants respectively, and these, with the palm tree capital, were the chief types employed by the Egyptians, until under the Ptolemies in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, various other river plants were also employed, and the conventional lotus capital went through various modifications. Women often wore amulets during childbirth, which depicted Heqet as a frog, sitting in a lotus. The number 1,000 in ancient Egyptian numerals is represented by the symbol of the white lotus. The related hieroglyph is: M12 The ancient Egyptians also extracted perfume from this flower. They also used the white lotus in funerary garlands, temple offerings and female adornment. The white lotus is a candidate for the plant eaten by the Lotophagi of Homer's Odyssey.  Health effects  Though the plant contains a quinolizidine alkaloid, nupharin, and related chemicals, either described according to sources as poisonous, intoxicating or without effects, it seems to have been consumed since Antiquity. The effects of the alkaloids would be those of a psychedelic aphrodisiac, though these effects are more those encountered in Nymphaea caerulea, the blue Egyptian water lily.  Chemistry  The chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of the leaf shows the presence of phenolic compounds (flavonoids, coumarins and tannins), sterols and alkaloids. Other compounds include myricitrin, myricetin 3-(6-p-coumaroylglucoside), myricetin-3'-O-(6\\"-p-coumaroyl)glucoside and two epimeric macrocyclic derivatives, nympholide A and B, myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose.Nymphaea lotus at knapsack_jsp References External links lotus Category:Flora of Africa Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Nymphaea lotus"},{"id":"2187088","text":"Alan Dale (born Aldo Sigismondi; July 9, 1925 ‚Äì April 20, 2002) was an American singer of traditional popular and rock and roll music. Early life Aldo Sigismondi was born in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Aristide Sigismondi, immigrated to the United States from Abruzzi, Italy, in 1904 at the age of 21, and became a comedian in Italian language theater, with a radio program of his own. His mother, Agata \\"Kate\\" Sigismondi, was born in Messina, Sicily, and was 15 years younger than Aristide. At the age of nine, Aldo got his first chance to perform publicly when his father was running short on his program and called on Aldo to sing. Though Aldo fainted immediately upon completing his song, he was good enough that he became a regular on his father's program. Dale's intention was originally not to be a singer, but to go into journalism. However, he quit school after an argument with a teacher and ended up going from one job to another, until one day in 1943 he and a friend passed by a casino in Coney Island and the friend suggested he try out for a singing job. He was told to come back in the evening, and when he came back prepared to sing two songs, was called back for seven encores. He was immediately hired. In 1944, he joined the Carmen Cavallaro Orchestra as featured vocalist, and at Cavallaro's insistence got a new name. The name was taken from Alan-a-Dale. In 1944 and 1945, Dale sang for George Paxton's Orchestra and became increasingly popular on the East Coast performing at the Roseland Ballroom in New York and recording for Majestic Records. Musical career In 1947 he was encouraged by Bob Thiele, a record producer, to sign up as a solo artist with Signature Records. He premiered as a soloist on Columbia records in a December 1947 film short featuring the Elliot Lawrence Orchestra. The next year he got his own television show, The Alan Dale Show, on the DuMont Television Network. In 1950, it went to CBS. In the early 1950s, he shuttled around from one record label to another, going from Columbia to Decca before settling with Coral, the label on which he had his major hits: \\"(The Gang that Sang) Heart of My Heart\\" (together with Johnny Desmond and Don Cornell), which reached #10 on Billboard in 1953, a vocal version of \\"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\\" which reached #14 in 1955, and \\"Sweet and Gentle\\", which also charted in 1955, at #10. The latter two recordings sold over one million copies each, and were awarded gold discs. Also in 1955. the singles \\"I'm Sincere\\" (the flip of \\"Cherry Pink\\") and \\"Rockin The Cha-Cha\\" reached the Music Vendor top 40. He became a friend of Alan Freed, and as a result got a chance to play a role as a rock and roll singer in the 1956 film, Don't Knock the Rock. In this movie, he played alongside Freed, Bill Haley & His Comets, Little Richard, and The Treniers. He sang the title song, which he also recorded as a single. In 1957 he resumed his shuttling from one record label to another, going to ABC, MGM, and United Artists. In 1958, while in a nightclub in New York, Dale was attacked, suffering cuts and a serious hand injury when he crashed into a plate glass window after having fallen down a set of stairs. Dale recovered from his injuries, but the assailant who knocked him down the stairs was never identified. Career decline and death At the end of the 1950s, Dale found television hosts such as Ed Sullivan were refusing to have him on their shows, causing his career to go into decline. This was not helped by his authorship of a 1965 autobiography, The Spider and the Marionettes, in which he listed names of people who were trying to affect his career adversely, with descriptions of their activities toward this end. Despite this, Dale was able to maintain a lower-profile version of his singing career over the ensuing decades, performing at nightclubs, dinner theaters and concert appearances. He died in New York in 2002, at the age of 76.

From 1977 to 1989, he owned Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), a wrestling company affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). From 1976 to 1987, he also owned the Charlotte Orioles, a minor league baseball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Crockett owned the Winston- Salem Polar Twins in the Southern Hockey League from 1975 to 1977. Career =Early life= Born to Jim Crockett and Elizabeth Crockett in Charlotte, Jim Jr. graduated from Myers Park High School in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1960. He and his younger siblings (David, Jackie, and Frances) were largely uninvolved in professional wrestling until their father's death in 1973. The elder Crockett had been a promoter of wrestling and other forms of entertainment since 1931 (with JCP joining the NWA in 1950). =Taking over Jim Crockett Promotions= Although Jim Crockett Sr. had decided his son-in- law John Ringley would run JCP, Jim Jr. reluctantly took over ownership of the company that same year.Flair, Ric.

Crockett brought in wrestler George Scott as head booker, and he signed wrestlers from across the country, from veterans such as Wahoo McDaniel to younger wrestlers like Ric Flair. =NWA president= First term In 1980, Crockett was elected to his first term as NWA President, which ended in 1982. He had a working relationship with Maple Leaf Wrestling, based out of Toronto and owned by Frank Tunney, until Tunney's death in 1983. Tunney's nephew Jack Tunney switched Maple Leaf Wrestling's working agreement to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Crockett then formed a short-lived relationship with Verne Gagne and his American Wrestling Association (AWA) to form Pro Wrestling USA. Second term Crockett was elected to a second term as NWA President in 1985. He bought Vince McMahon's Saturday night TV time slot on Superstation WTBS and his business began to flourish. During that year, he organized the first annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup, in which wrestlers from eight NWA regional territories participated in a day-long tag team tournament at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The Road Warriors defeated Ron Garvin & Magnum T.A. after 7¬Ω hours to win the tournament. Although Crockett had organized the tournament as a tribute to his father, several rival promoters suspected he was using the event to further his own plans for expanding his promotion nationally. Their suspicions increased as Crockett began holding wrestling events in Memphis and Florida without contacting the local NWA promoters. He eventually purchased promotions based in Oklahoma and Kansas City in the Mid-South territory and began airing his own televised wrestling events, which were syndicated across the United States.Greenberg, Keith Elliot.

General information The TK82C had the ZILOG Z80A processor running at 3.25 MHz, 2 KB SRAM and 8 KB of EPROM with the BASIC interpreter. The keyboard was made of layers of conductive (membrane) material and followed the Sinclair pattern. The video output was sent via a RF modulator to a TV set tuned at VHF channel 3, and it featured black characters on a white background. The maximum resolution was 64 x 44 pixels black and white, for graphic plotting. There were some special characters (shade patterns) useful for games and basic images. The TK82C included the SLOW function which permitted the video be shown during the processing (the prior version, TK82, a Sinclair ZX80 clone, ran only in fast mode, so the image was not shown during its processing). In reality, the SLOW function was done by an add-on board that was factory-mounted over the main board. Although being a ZX81 clone, the TK82C did not have the ULA chip from Ferranti, used in the former. Instead it was manufactured with a dozen of TTL integrated circuits, which resulted in a somewhat large power consumption. This could be noted as the computer's case used to become quite hot after some minutes of operation. Data Storage Data storage was done in audio cassette tapes at 300 bits per second, and large programs could take up to 6 minutes to load. Audio cables were supplied with the computer for connection with a regular tape recorder. As the data encoding was entirely done by software, some hacks were made available to allow much faster transfers. Hi-fi recorders were required in order to use the greater speeds with a minimum of reliability. Accessories * A 16 KB DRAM expansion was made available and, despite being optional, became a standard item. Soon after, a 48 KB expansion was also released, but due to pricing and the problematic data storage in cassettes, it never sold well. * The TK82C featured a DIN connector for a joystick (in reality, it was wired to the keyboard matrix); Microdigital then marketed an Atari 2600 joystick, accordingly retrofitted to match the DIN connector. * A small printer, indeed a ZX Printer clone, was announced for a long time by Microdigital, but was never released. Compatibility and Legal Issues All software designed to the ZX81 could run in the TK82C with no problems, and vice versa. So it was not uncommon to find software distributed in Brazil, that were nothing more than illegitimate copies of products for the ZX81. However, given the TK82's popularity, a great deal of original software was developed in Brazil as well. In 1983, Sinclair Research sued Microdigital over copyright violation because of the unauthorized cloning of its product. Due to political trends from that time, the Brazilian court in charge of the case sided with Microdigital.Andr√© Lipp Pinto Basto Lupi.

ISOs are also sometimes referred to as statutory stock options by the IRS.TITLE 26 - INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, Subtitle A - Income Taxes, CHAPTER 1 - NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES, Regulations ¬ß 422 Incentive stock options ISOs have a strike price, which is the price a holder must pay to purchase one share of the stock. ISOs may be issued both by public companies and private companies, with ISOs being common as a form of executive compensation for public companies, and common as a form of equity compensation in private start-up companies. The tax benefit is that on exercise, the individual does not pay ordinary income tax nor employment taxes on the difference between the exercise price and the strike price of the shares issued (but may owe a substantial alternative minimum tax if the shares are not sold in the same year, especially if the difference between exercise price and strike price is large, on the order of $50,000 or more). Rather, if the shares are held for 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant (a \\"qualifying disposition\\"), then the profit made above the strike price is taxed entirely as a long-term capital gain, at a maximum rate of 23.8% as opposed to 37%.  History  Tax treatment for the incentive stock option was created by the Revenue Act of 1950. In the following decade, stock option grants became popular as a form of compensation, primarily for executives. The introduction of restricted shares and performance shares in the 1960s and 1970s diminished its popularity, but stock options continued to dominate through the 1960s, 1980s, and 1990s. In October 2004, section 409(a) of the tax code was added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which set rules requiring the strike price of the option grant to be at least the fair market value, giving rise to the term 409(a) valuation. In 2005, law professor Erik Lie published a report into the options backdating involving changing the strike price and date of an option after issue, which led to over 100 SEC and DOJ investigations, resulting in 12 criminal sentences. As of 2014, stock options including ISOs are no longer the most common form of long-term equity incentive rewards for executives, with about half given as performance shares, a quarter as RSUs, and a quarter as stock options.  Taxation rules  If the shares are sold before this required holding period (a \\"disqualifying disposition\\") in the same tax year, then the difference between the price at the time of exercise minus the strike price is taxed as ordinary income, and any additional gain on top of the exercise price is taxed as a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are subject to the same tax brackets as ordinary income but are also subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax. If the incentive stock option is sold above the strike price but below the exercise price in the same tax year, the income is recognized solely as ordinary income. If sold before the required 1-year holding period in a different tax year. Even if a disqualifying disposition is made, if the shares exercised are not sold in the same tax year, the holder must calculate to see if any alternative minimum tax is owed. Although ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than NSOs (non-qualified stock options or nonstatutory stock options), they require the holder to take on more risk by holding the stock for a longer period of time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal tax deferral value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's taxable reporting period. Ordinary income from incentive stock options, unlike wage income or income from NSOs, is also not subject to payroll taxes such as FICA. Note further that an employer generally does not claim a corporate income tax deduction (which would be in an amount equal to the amount of income recognized by the employee) upon the exercise of its employee's ISO, unless the employee does not meet the holding-period requirements and sells early, making a disqualifying disposition.Coughlan, Section 174 R&E; Deduction Upon Statutory Stock Option Exercise, 58 Tax Law. 435 (2005). With NQSOs, on the other hand, the employer is always eligible to claim a deduction upon its employee's exercise of the NQSO.  Elections and considerations  = Extended exercise window and conversion to nonqualified stock options = ISOs must be exercised by an employee within 3 months of termination of employment or be forfeited. Since it may be difficult or impossible to sell shares on the secondary market, this would often either force employees to pay a substantial alternative minimum tax liability, or forfeit their earned shares. To solve this issue, some private companies allow the option to convert ISOs to NSOs, which allows the exercise period to be extended to up to 10 years. In March 2015, Pinterest announced that it was allowing employees who had worked with the company for at least two years to convert their ISOs to NSOs and be able to exercise those options for up to 7 years, spurring a wave of companies to follow suit. = 83(i) election = The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created the 83(i) election for tax year 2018, which allows an employee of a company satisfying certain requirements to defer taxation upon exercise for up to 5 years. The 83(i) election provision and its requirements is very similar to the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act proposed by senators Mark Warner and Dean Heller in 2016.  Examples of taxation upon exercise and sale  = AMT on exercise and both qualifying and disqualifying dispositions = On January 1, 2014, the employee of a private company receives a grant of 1,000 shares at a strike price of $1 vesting monthly over 4 years. Note that the strike price for an employee's ISO grant must be set to the current 409(a) fair market value of the common shares, which is generally lower than that of the preferred valuation of shares owned by venture capitalists that is quoted in news. At this point, the company may contain 9 million shares at a preferred price of $3, valuing the company as a whole at $27 million. At this point, the company can choose to offer the option of early exercise: where an employee can purchase the entire grant before vesting, and perform an 83(b) election and notify the IRS within 30 days with form 83(b). If the employee performs an early exercise and does not fully vest the shares, the exercise price for the unvested shares is returned. In this example, the employee does not early exercise. On January 1, 2018, the company raises another round of funding as the company grows, issuing an additional 1 million shares at a preferred price of $300. The company performs another 409(a) valuation and values the common shares at $200 each. The valuation of the company as a whole is now $3 billion, making it a unicorn. On February 1, 2018, the employee elects to exercise, or purchase, these vested shares. The employee has fully vested the shares, and must pay a price of $1 per share to purchase these ISOs. The employee pays $1,000 to exercise these shares. The current difference between the common share price, $200, and the strike price, $1, creates a bargain element of $199 per share or a total bargain element of $199,000. If not sold by the end of this year, this $199,000 bargain element along with the employee's ordinary income is taxable under AMT at a maximum rate of 28%, which is then imposed if it is higher than the ordinary tax. On May 1, 2018, the company raises additional capital in an initial public offering, where the shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $400 per share. On December 1, 2018, the employee sells 500 of the 1,000 shares at a price of $350 per share. These shares are now a disqualifying disposition because they were sold before a 1 year holding period. This sale generates ordinary income of $175,000. On December 31, 2018, the remaining 500 exercised but not sold shares creates a bargain element of ($200-1)*500=$99,500 that may be taxed under the alternative minimum tax. For tax year 2018, a single taxpayer earning $100,000 with no special adjustments may incur about $40,000 of AMT preference items such as the bargain element of incentive stock option exercise and hold without paying AMT, due to the AMT exemption. On February 1, 2019, the employee sells the remaining 500 shares at $300 per share. The employee now owes long term capital gains tax on 500*($300-1)=$149,500. If the taxpayer paid AMT in 2018, the taxpayer is may be entitled to recoup any AMT credit generated in tax year 2019.  Requirements for classification as ISO  Additionally, there are several other restrictions which have to be met (by the employer or employee) in order to qualify the compensatory stock option as an ISO. For a stock option to qualify as ISO and thus receive special tax treatment under Section 421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \\"Code\\"), it must meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code when granted and at all times beginning from the grant until its exercise. The requirements include: * The option may be granted only to an employee (grants to non-employee directors or independent contractors are not permitted), who must exercise the option while he/she is an employee or no later than three (3) months after termination of employment (unless the option holder is disabled, in which case this three-month period is extended to one year. In case of death the option can be exercised by the legal heirs of the deceased until the expiration date). * The option must be granted under a written plan document specifying the total number of shares that may be issued and the employees who are eligible to receive the options. The plan must be approved by the stockholders within 12 months before or after plan adoption. * Each option must be granted under an ISO agreement, which must be written and must list the restrictions placed on exercising the ISO. Each option must set forth an offer to sell the stock at the option price and the period of time during which the option will remain open. * The option must be granted within 10 years of the earlier of adoption or shareholder approval, and the option must be exercisable only within 10 years of grant. * The option exercise price must equal or exceed the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of grant. * The employee must not, at the time of grant, own stock representing more than 10% of voting power of all stock outstanding, unless the option exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value and the option expires no later than five (5) years from the time of the grant. * The ISO agreement must specifically state that ISO cannot be transferred by the option holder other than by will or by the laws of descent and that the option cannot be exercised by anyone other than the option holder. * The aggregate fair market value (determined as of the grant date) of stock bought by exercising ISOs that are exercisable for the first time cannot exceed $100,000 in a calendar year. To the extent it does, Code section 422(d) provides that such options are treated as non- qualified stock options.

The Spectre M4 is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by Gritti, until 2001. The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top- folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely steel Spectre has a polymer overmolded grip, magazine release and safety/selector levers. The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian special forces, and has been exported elsewhere. Design details The Spectre is a striker-fired blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt. The trigger group is double-action with a decocker. When the decocker is activated the striker is dropped while a small flap that contacts the firing pin is retracted. When the trigger is pulled in the double-action-like mode, the striker is retracted then dropped, firing the gun. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately as the double-action trigger eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting. A manual safety is provided. Unconventional 50-round and 30-round capacity, four-column magazines are provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional two-column magazines. Civilian variants Versions of the SITES \\"Spectre\\" M4 submachine gun specifically made for the civilian market have been around since the middle 1980s and up to the late 1990s, their production suffering a major backlash when the US Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the import and sale of them on the American market, the biggest and most lucrative for this kind of item. The civilian- grade variants of the SITES \\"Spectre\\" M4 have namely been a semi-automatic pistol called the SITES \\"Falcon\\" (marketed in the United States as the \\"Spectre-HC\\") and a semi-automatic sub-carbine called the SITES \\"Ranger\\". These weapons retain the main layout of the original \\"Spectre\\" submachine gun, are incapable of fully automatic fire, and the original magazine capacity is reduced for marketing in countries where the law requires it (such as Italy). The SITES \\"Falcon\\" (or \\"Spectre-HC\\") pistol may or may not be encountered with the original top-folding stock and foregrip (the samples sold in the United States as the \\"Spectre-HC\\" generally feature none of these; the \\"Falcon\\" sold in Italy feature both, with the foregrip being removable). The SITES \\"Ranger\\" sub-carbine, which was a distinctly Italian market gun, features the foregrip (which is removable), a longer barrel, and the top-folding stock is permanently locked into open position to comply with the requirements of the Italian laws about the minimum allowed length for civilian-legal long arms. The top-folding stock on the SITES \\"Ranger\\" subcarbine was, however, engineered to be easily removable for storage. In the version of this carbine sold in Italy, the removal of the stock was made harder, requiring the use of tools, and proceeding to effectively shorten the weapon by this way could be prosecuted as a criminal offense. In other countries (where legal), the removal of the stock in this and other versions was easier.

The group, formed in 1985, was supposedly intended to be a power trio; the guitarist, however, never showed up to the band's first rehearsal so the group remained a duo. The music touches on progressive rock, jazz fusion and noise rock. Background The French progressive rock band Magma is the group's most important influence, to such an extent that Ruins' original lyrics are written and sung in an invented language which, at first glance, resembles Koba√Øan, the language invented by Christian Vander of Magma. Ruins' material (which Yoshida, who composes the majority of their pieces, writes out in score form) is generally of extreme complexity and thus is often described as inaccessible; potential listeners may be bewildered by the band's unrestrained yet disciplined approach. In addition to the \\"prog rock\\" label, the group's music has also been described as \\"math rock\\" and \\"zeuhl\\". That said, Ruins' style has consistently evolved since the band's beginning, often changing according to the bassist that Tatsuya was collaborating with at the time. Ruins have collaborated with several other musicians, including prominent avant-garde figure Derek Bailey, auteur guitarist/multi- instrumentalist Keiji Haino, and Ground Zero alumnus Kazuhisa Uchihashi. Bassist Sasaki Hisashi left the band in 2004, and since then Yoshida has been touring solo under the name Ruins-alone (Ruins Alone). He has also performed as Sax Ruins with alto saxophonist Ono Ryoko. He was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival Groening curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England. On September 6, 2016, Tatsuya announced via his Facebook that third period bassist Masuda Ryuichi would be rejoining the band for a show in December and shows throughout the spring.Facebook post circa September 6, 2016 Accessed September 6, 2016 Members ;Current members *Tatsuya Yoshida ‚Äì drums, percussion, vocals (1985‚Äìpresent) ;Former members *Kawamoto Hideki ‚Äì bass, vocals (1985‚Äì1987) *Kimoto Kazuyoshi ‚Äì bass, vocals, violin (1987‚Äì1990) *Masuda Ryuichi ‚Äì bass, vocals (1991‚Äì1997, 2016) *Sasaki Hisashi ‚Äì bass, vocals (1995‚Äì2004) Discography * Ruins III (1988) (reissued as Infect in 1993) * Stonehenge (1990) * Burning Stone (1992) * Graviyaunosch (1993) * Hyderomastgroningem (1995) * Refusal Fossil (1997/2007) * Vrresto (1998) * Symphonica (1998) * Pallaschtom (2000) * Tzomborgha (2002) * Yawiquo (as Sax Ruins) (2009) * Alone (as Ruins Alone) (2011) * Blimmguass (as Sax Ruins) (2013) EPs, live releases, and compilations * Ruins (EP) (1986) * Ruins II (EP) (1987) * Early Works: Live & Unreleased Tracks (1991) * II & 19 Numbers (1992) * 0'33\\" (live album)(1993) * Split with Dawson (1993) * Split with Schlong (1994) * March‚ÄìOctober 1997 (1997,2002,2003) * Mandala 2000: Live at the Kichijoji Mandala II (2000) * 1986-1992 (2001) * Live in Guangzhou (2002) * Ales Stenar (2001) * Split with High on Fire (2005) Collaborations * Ruins & Umezu Kazutoki (1994, with Umezu Kazutoki) * Hatoba & Ruins (1994, with Omoide Hatoba) * Saisoro (1995, with Derek Bailey) * Jason Willet & Ruins (1995, with Jason Willet) * Tohjinbo (1997, with Derek Bailey) * Ketsunoana (1998, with Ron Anderson) * Big Shoes (2001, with Ron Anderson) * Kazuhisa Uchihashi & Ruins (1998, with Kazuhisa Uchihashi) * Live In Europe (2001, with Kazuhisa Uchihashi) * Knead (2002, with Keiji Haino) * New Rap (2006, with Keiji Haino) * Uhrfasudhasdd (2008, with Keiji Haino) * Hauenfiomiume (2008, with Keiji Haino) * 2008 New Japan Festival (2008, with various artists, including Ruins-Alone) See also *Romantic Warriors II: A Progressive Music Saga About Rock in Opposition *Romantic Warriors II: Special Features DVD References External links * Tatsuya Yoshida website * Ruins website @ SKiN GRAFT Records Category:Japanese rock music groups Category:Japanese progressive rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Zeuhl Category:Shimmy Disc artists Category:Tzadik Records artists Category:1985 establishments in Japan ","title":"Ruins (Japanese band)"},{"id":"2187150","text":"The London Emergency Services Liaison Panel (LESLP) consists of representatives from the following agencies: *Metropolitan Police Service *London Fire Brigade *City of London Police *British Transport Police *London Ambulance Service (NHS Trust) *HM Coastguard (London) *Port of London Authority *All London Local Authorities *Military (Joint Regional Liaison Officer) *Transport for London *London Resilience Group Established in 1973, the group meets regularly and is chaired by the Metropolitan Police Service. The role of the LESLP is to establish the correct procedures for a collaborative approach to responding to major incidents within London. A major incident could be anything from a terrorist attack to a natural disaster. A revised version of the LESLP Major Incident Procedure Manual (2019 edition) is published on the London Prepared webpages.  Major incident  A \\"major incident\\" is defined by LESLP as \\"an event or situation with a range of serious consequences which requires special arrangements to be implemented by one or more emergency responder agency.\\" Definition of a \\"major incident\\" explanatory notes: * ‚ÄòEmergency responder agency‚Äô describes all category one and two responders as defined in the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) and associated guidance. * A major incident is beyond the scope of business-as- usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national security. * A major incident may involve a single-agency response, although it is more likely to require a multi-agency response, which may be in the form of multi-agency support to a lead responder. * The severity of the consequences associated with a major incident are likely to constrain or complicate the ability of responders to resource and manage the incident, although a major incident is unlikely to affect all responders equally. * The decision to declare a major incident will always be a judgement made in a specific local and operational context, and there are no precise and universal thresholds or triggers. Where Local Resilience Forums and responders have explored these criteria in the local context and ahead of time, decision makers will be better informed and more confident in making that judgement. This definition is different to the definition of an \\"Emergency\\", a related term defined in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. An example of the declaration of a major incident is the emergency system activated during the 7 July 2005 attacks on London.  Declaration of a major incident  Declaring a ‚Äômajor incident‚Äô triggers a response from each emergency service and other responder agencies. It takes time for operational structures, resources and protocols to be put in place. Declaring that a major incident is in progress as soon as possible means these arrangements can be put in place as quickly as possible. A major incident may be declared by one or more emergency responder agency if any of the major incident criteria is satisfied. A major incident declaration will normally be declared by one of the emergency services. In certain circumstances, for example flooding, a local authority or other responder agency may declare a major incident. It is important that all individuals who could be first on scene for their respective responder agency are able to declare a major incident, and that they understand the implications of declaring one. A major incident declared by one emergency responder agency may not be so for another, however, each agency will attend with an appropriate response and notify relevant support organisations. This is so even if they are to be employed in a standby capacity and not directly involved in the incident.  Stages  Major incidents are considered to have four stages, namely: *Initial Response *Consolidation Phase *Recovery Phase *Restoration of Normality  Co-ordinating groups  In the event of a major incident, the formation of Strategic, Tactical and Operational co-ordinating groups (also known as Gold and Silver co-ordinating groups) will occur. These groups will be responsible for actions and co-ordination within their own spheres of activity.

In West Germany, the Navy has adopted MPL, and some police agencies adopted either MPL, MPK and/or both. During the 1972 Munich Olympics and the ensuing terrorist incident, the local police was equipped with the MPL. However, most of the police officers dispatched at this time were only trained as patrol police officers and had little experience in using MPL. The counter-terrorist unit GSG-9, which was established the incident, adopted the H&K; MP5 as their service submachine gun instead of Walther MP. As spread of MP5 began, it would begin to eclipse the Walther MP's sales until the Walther product was discontinued.https://www.tactical- life.com/firearms/mpl-mpk-walther-subguns/#ms16-wmp-lead In addition, exports to other countries were also carried out. Many countries, such as Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, only acquired the compact MPK variant. Walther MP was also used as a submachine gun for special forces in the United States. In addition to being used by US Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War, it is said to have been used in Operation Ivory Coast by the United States Army Special Forces. The Delta Force used the Walther MP during transitional period of US Army, when the M3 submachine gun was starting to get phased out in favour of MP5.https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/mpl-mpk-walther-subguns/#ms16-wmp- lead Members of the Delta Force were equipped with the Walther MP during the abortive Operation Eagle Claw.Griswold, Terry and D.M. Giangreco. Delta: America's Elite Counterterrorist Force. Osecola, WI: MBI Publishing Company, 1992. . At the end of it's lifespan, it's sales were sluggish. The production of the MP ended in 1983 with the final production was about 27,000 guns. world.guns.ru/smg/de/walther-mpl-e.html Variants There are two versions of the Walther MP: the MPK (Maschinenpistole Kurz or \\"short machine pistol\\"), illustrated at right, and the MPL (Maschinenpistole Lang or \\"long machine pistol\\"). The only difference between MPK and MPL guns is the length of the barrel, and that the MPL has 100 and 200 meter settings. Description The mechanism is simple blowback, but with an unusual bolt design, similar in concept but distinct from that of a telescoping bolt. In the Walther, most of the mass of the bolt consists of a hollow tubular weight that is actually placed above and parallel to the barrel, housed in a separate channel in which it reciprocates when the gun is fired. Fixed rigidly to the underside of this heavy tube is an additional steel block that performs most of the tasks of a standard sub-machine gun bolt, that is, this part chambers the rounds and seals them in the chamber, fires them and extracts the empty cartridges. This section is however very small and light in comparison to the bolts of more conventional simple blowback sub-machine guns, as most of the necessary mass and thus inertia is provided by the tubular weight above. This weight extends well ahead of the chamber when the gun is in battery, and also contains the main spring, and so the design is horizontally compact and permits both guns to feature relatively long barrels for their overall length. The receiver is made from stamped steel, with plentiful ventilation slots; and the prominent cocking handle is located on its left front. A selective fire switch is also on both the left and right side of the receiver, behind the trigger, allowing for ambidextrous use. During cold war, the MP was issued to many special forces units and was designed to use a suppressor. However, the Walther MP had a very loud mechanical operating noise, and its quietness was limited. In a test in which a silencer was attached and the sound of shooting subsonic bullets was measured from a distance of 5 m, a peak value of about 116-118 decibels was measured. Both guns feature side-folding buttstocks, made from thin steel tubes wrapped in a rubber coating. Users *: MPK variant.Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010.

The station is owned and operated by Brown Broadcasting Service, an independent non-profit organization, and is primarily staffed by students from Brown University. Formerly an FM modern rock radio station that broadcast at 95.5 FM in the Rhode Island area, WBRU currently broadcasts two online stations with different genres on each: indie and alternative on WBRU and an urban contemporary format on WBRU360, named after its long-time Sunday program, The 360¬∞ Experience in Sound. Since January 2018, WBRU's urban contemporary programming has been rebroadcast on Providence low-power FM station 101.1 FM, which is owned by another Brown University-affiliated group and has the call sign WBRU-LP. WBRU has its origins in The Brown Network, which was founded in 1936 as one of the earliest amateur college radio broadcasters. By the time that the Brown Broadcasting Service organization was founded in 1962, radio broadcasting on the Brown University campus had turned from a hobbyist activity to a more serious enterprise. The organization purchased a commercial FM license in 1965 and aired its first broadcast on WBRU-FM on February 21, 1966. The station aired with a progressive rock format in the 1960s and 1970s, added new wave music into its playlist in the early 1980s, and switched to its current modern rock format in 1988. From 1966 to 2017, WBRU aired on the 95.5 FM frequency in the Providence market. In August 2017, Brown Broadcasting Service sold the 95.5 license to Educational Media Foundation and WBRU was replaced on that frequency by WLVO, a Christian adult contemporary station, at midnight on September 1, 2017. Although its primary alternative rock programming is no longer available on an over-the-air radio station, WBRU itself continues to be operated by BBS, and offers both its alternative rock and urban contemporary programming as an online-only programming provider. History =Beginnings= WBRU traces its origin to \\"The Brown Network\\", a low-power carrier current station that broadcast at 570 kHz on the AM band, and whose signal was limited to the Brown campus. (At this time, the two National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio networks were known as the \\"Red Network\\" and the \\"Blue Network\\".) This first-ever carrier current stationCarrier current transmissions had been used since the late 1910s for electrical companies to transmit telemetry and telephony over their high- voltage distribution lines, but this appears to be the first time it was used to set up a broadcasting station. was established 1936 by George Abraham\\"Dr. George Abraham, Ph.D\\" (collegebroadcasters.us) and David W. Borst.\\"David W. Borst\\" (collegebroadcasters.us) Abraham had originally installed an intercom system between his and Borst's dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then replaced by distributed low-powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings' electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions.The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946 by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13. Abraham originally conceived of the idea as a way to share his record collection and serve as a personal disk jockey for his friends. By the next year, he had installed wires through the trees on campus in order to connect to a number of buildings, assigning students in individual dormitories to act as \\"section managers\\" who would receive the signal and retransmit it throughout the rest of their building. After being recognized as an extra- curricular activity, The Brown Network was assigned a studio and control room located in the Faunce House student union building. The New England Hurricane of 1938 destroyed most of the distribution wires, and Borst and Abraham were forced to move the wires into the steam tunnels beneath the campus. On November 3, 1939, David Sarnoff, the president of the Radio Corporation of America (whose son attended Brown) made a broadcast over The Brown Network. On February 17‚Äì18, 1940 an organizing convention for the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) was held at Brown, attended by representatives from twelve colleges with existing or proposed carrier current stations. Abraham was elected the IBS Chairman, and Borst the Technical Manager. IBS's role was defined as a medium for the exchange of ideas and programs, in addition to working to attract national advertising contracts for the member stations. The first IBS intercollegiate broadcasts began on May 9, 1940, with a five-part series that was carried by stations located throughout New England at Brown, Harvard, Williams, and Wesleyan universities, in addition to the Universities of Connecticut and Rhode Island.Bloch (1980), pages 14-29. In 1945, student journalists began to use the WBRU call letters on air, which had been coined by undergraduate Stephen Plimpton. =The '60s and '70s= In 1962, the Brown Broadcasting Service (BBS) was established as a separate entity from the University and in 1965, the BBS purchased a commercial FM license (WPFM) from a company that was \\"bankrupt\\". BBS was then split into two stations: \\"WBRU-AM\\" and WBRU FM. WBRU-AM continued to broadcast locally as a carrier current station (distributed through Brown's electrical system) and operated as the training station for WBRU FM. Brown Broadcasting Service began broadcasting from WBRU-FM at the 95.5 frequency on February 21, 1966; The first program to be transmitted from the new station was a panel show which discussed the Peace Corps. By the mid-'60s WBRU was considered an alternative station in that much of the music was folk and rock. Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens, Joan Baez had a home on this station and were not yet on mainstream radio. After 1966 much of the music format was not mainstream. The station was considered an \\"Underground Rock Music Station\\" similar to Boston's WBCN. The station's playlist featured artists such as Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention, The Fugs, Pearls Before Swine, Phil Ochs, Country Joe & The Fish and other left-leaning rock acts that were not typically played on mainstream radio. During the 1970s, WBRU broadcast at 20,000 watts on 95.5 FM and established itself as the principal progressive rock (aka, album-oriented rock or AOR) station in Rhode Island and southern New England. Attempts to boost the signal to 50,000 watts with a transmitter on the Sciences Library failed because of the interference it caused to sensitive scientific equipment, but the station was making plans to move its transmitter to the WPRO-FM transmitter location and increase power to 50,000 watts. This could not be done until 2009 because public TV station WSBE-TV's analog TV antenna currently occupies the tower space where WBRU plans to put its broadcast antenna. WSBE is locating its digital antenna at the WJAR antenna tower in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. =Switch to alternative format= logo used from the early 2000s until late 2009 In 1988, WBRU switched its format to modern rock and has remained in that format ever since, although leaning towards playing newer artists and artists of the indie rock genre. logo used from the early 2010 through August 31, 2017 WBRU was also frequently named one of the best radio stations in the country by numerous trade magazines such as Billboard and Rolling Stone (which named it best radio station in the country in a medium size market three years in a row, the only radio station ever to achieve that). The station is part of the Providence music scene, and has been instrumental in introducing to the area alternative bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and countless other important bands. It was among the first radio stations in the United States to play Ben Folds Five and Talking Heads. Kurt Cobain's last radio interview before his death was on WBRU. Between April 17 and April 21, 2006, WBRU played their entire music catalog by title from A-Z, starting at 5:30 p.m. with \\"About a Girl\\" by Nirvana on the 17th and ending around 11:15 on the 21st with \\"Zombie\\" by The Cranberries. The songs ranged from new music (by such bands as Panic! at the Disco and Zox), 1980s and 1990s pop rarely played by the station (such as Right Said Fred's \\"I'm Too Sexy\\") and classic punk (i.e. Sex Pistols and New York Dolls). On June 15, 2006, the station began streaming live online. WBRU aired its first voicetracked break at 5:17 PM on November 15, 2010, during the Afternoon BRU with Corey and Cato. =2017 frequency sale and end of over-the-air broadcasting on 95.5 FM= In March 2017, the station's board of directors passed a resolution to begin seeking a buyer for the station, after 60 years of being owned and operated by the independent non-profit Brown Broadcasting Service organization. Many student members and alumni of the station were opposed to the resolution. On August 25, 2017, it was announced that Brown Broadcasting Service had sold the 95.5 FM terrestrial frequency to Educational Media Foundation, a Christian music broadcaster, which planned to take over the frequency on September 1. The WBRU call letters and brand were not included as part of the sale, and Brown Student Radio applied to the FCC to transfer the call letters to its low-power radio station. In a statement on its website, WBRU announced that it would continue operations as an online radio station, with separate feeds for both its traditional modern rock format and its 360 Degree Experience in Sound hip hop and R&B; program. WBRU aired for the last time on 95.5 FM at 11:59 p.m. on August 31 and was replaced on that frequency by Educational Media Foundation's K-Love Christian adult contemporary network. The final song played on 95.5 WBRU before the changeover was \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" by The White Stripes, followed by a final signoff by programing director DJ Chilbo. One minute later, at midnight on September 1, WBRU was relaunched as an online-only station, with the first song played being \\"Welcome To Paradise\\" by Green Day. Although the sale had not been completed by the time WBRU ceased broadcasting on 95.5FM, Educational Media Foundation opted to lease the frequency until the deal was approved. Brown University and its president, Christina Paxson, opposed the sale of the signal and license. In April 2017, Paxson e-mailed the station's board asking them to reconsider their plan and offered financial assistance to the station. In October, Paxson asked the board to consider a proposal from earlier in the year to sell the license to Rhode Island Public Radio instead of Educational Media Foundation in order to keep WBRU programming on the radio in some form. The day of WBRU's final broadcast on FM radio, former student executive board member Tucker Hamilton alleged that the sale of the station's licence was coerced; Hamilton and other members of a WBRU alumni group asked Rhode Island attorney general Peter Kilmartin to block the sale to Educational Media Foundation.GoLocal Live; August 31, 2017. Retrieved September 1, 2017. According to the attorney general's office, they met \\"with alumni and their attorney as a courtesy, but as our attorneys explained, Rhode Island statute and regulation does not give the attorney general any legal authority to intervene, as is the case in nearly all private sales.‚Äù The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of the 95.5FM license to Educational Media Foundation on October 24, 2017. The transfer was finalized on November 4. In January 2018, the WBRU callsign was transferred to a low- power Providence-based station located at 101.1 MHz and operated by the non- profit Brown Student and Community Radio group and the Providence arts and event space AS220. The group and its station are not affiliated with the current WBRU online station or Brown Broadcasting Service, but they have made an arrangement with both to rebroadcast WBRU's urban contemporary online stream over the air. Although the low-power station intends to eventually scale back on rebroadcasting WBRU programming as they introduce their own, they do plan to continuing airing some programs on a permanent basis, including the Sunday 360¬∞ Experience in Sound hip-hop and R&B; program. The alternative and indie programming continues to run on a 24/7 stream as well through the station's website and mobile app. Brown Student Radio (BSR) In 1997, WBRU's carrier-current AM station split off and became Brown Student Radio (BSR), broadcasting initially on WELH/88.1, under a license owned by The Wheeler School and online . In 2003, BSR added a community radio element to its mission, incorporating community members as programmers and volunteers alongside students. In August 2011 BSR lost their air time on WELH and became an internet-only station. In January 2015, BSR was granted an FCC license for an LPFM station WPVD-LP on 101.1FM in Providence, in conjunction with Providence Community Radio and AS220. The Brown Student Radio station adopted the callsign WBRU-LP on September 1, 2017. The LPFM radio station went on the air on January 3, 2018. =Governance= 88 Benevolent St., the building from which WBRU broadcasts and is headquartered 95.5 WBRU was operated and run on a commercial basis. Its Program Director prior to the FM sale was Wendell Clough, who had been at the station for over a decade and was known by the on- air name \\"Wendell Gee\\", after the R.E.M. song of the same name. Its General Sales Manager was Jim Corwin, the former Vice President/Market Manager of Clear Channel Communications radio stations in Providence. Programming and formats While an over-the-air station, WBRU aired a modern rock format six days a week, featuring alternative rock and other related genres, such as indie rock and punk rock. On Sundays, the station switched formats to hip hop and urban contemporary in a day-long program called The 360 Degree Experience in Sound. As an online-only station, WBRU now carries two separate, 24/7 feeds, one for each format. =Buddy FM prank= On March 29, 2006, WBRU claimed to be sold to Initech (a reference to the 1999 film Office Space) and changed the format of the station from alternative rock to \\"Buddy FM\\" - a variety hits format similar to the Jack format that had emerged at stations around the country. WBRU \\"signed off\\" on 4:57PM March 31, 2006, cutting out 10 seconds before the end of what they proclaimed to the final song played by the station, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\\" by Green Day and was replaced by dead air until 5:02PM, switching to \\"Buddy FM\\" with \\"The Sign\\" by Ace of Base. The hoax was complete with telling radio sweepers done in-studio. Some examples included: \\"Buddy FM: hits of the '70s '80s '90s and today... and the 1940s... and the 1850s...\\", and mentions that the station was \\"fun for the whole family\\" after which the station played \\"Me So Horny\\" by 2 Live Crew. Local network television affiliates WJAR and WLNE-TV reported that WBRU had been sold without gaining confirmation about the story. It was later found out to be an April fools joke, and, as of noon on April 1, 2006, WBRU had \\"regained\\" control of their radio station and began playing their normal playlist once again. As the climax for the joke, Rich Lupo, the owner of Providence rock club Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, claimed on air that he had \\"purchased\\" the station from \\"Initech\\" and given it back to the WBRU DJs. Later that day, the station's DJs confirmed that the entire stunt had been an elaborate April Fools' joke. =World premieres= In 2006, WBRU was the first U.S. radio station to play \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" by British band Muse and played the Beck single \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" before its release until Interscope Records filed a cease and desist order against the station. In 2007, WBRU premiered the Smashing Pumpkins new single \\"Tarantula\\" only 15 minutes after KROQ-FM world premiered it, becoming only the second station in the country to play it and the first to play it twice when they played it a second time immediately afterwards. In 2008, WBRU was the first station in the country to air \\"I Will Possess Your Heart\\" by Death Cab For Cutie, which it did at approximately 1:30 p.m. on March 18, 2008. In 2009, WBRU was the first station to debut Say Anything's new single \\"Hate Everyone.\\" The single premiered at approximately 3:30 p.m. on August 17, 2009. The band's lead singer Max Bemis also premiered the song \\"Crush'd,\\" playing acoustic in studio. In 2013, WBRU was the first station to play Macklemore's \\"Thrift Shop\\" as reported by Billboard Magazine.http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the- juice/1484126/macklemore-ryan-lewis-crash-radio-with-thrift-shop = Timeline of notable events = *1936 - First broadcast of the Brown Network *1940 - The newly formed Intercollegiate Broadcasting System holds its first meeting at Brown *1948 - The Outlet Company's WJAR-FM signs on 95.5 (May 10) *1950 - According to the 1950 Broadcasting Yearbook, WJAR-FM broadcasts at 20 kW *1953 - The FCC cancels the license for WJAR-FM at The Outlet Company's request (January 19) *1955 - Plantation Broadcasting Corporation is granted the license at 95.5 for WPFM (May 25) *1962 - Brown Broadcasting Service (BBS) is established as a corporation independent from Brown University *1963 - The first BBS/WBRU constitution is written *1965 - Brown Broadcasting Service, Inc. buys 95.5 WPFM for $30,000 and changes the call letters to WBRU *1966 - Brown Broadcasting Service begins broadcasting on 95.5 WBRU (February 21) *1969 - WBRU is the first progressive rock station in the market *1971 - Attempts to broadcast at 50,000 watts failed due to interference with sensitive scientific equipment *1974 - WBRU is granted tax-exempt status *1975 - First paid professionals are hired *1976 - Station receives first Gold Record for airplay of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run.\\" *1979 - WBRU moves its studio from Faunce House to 88 Benevolent Street, its current location *1981 - Competitor 94.1 WHJY signs on (October) *1982 - Due to low ratings, WBRU abandons its free-form format and hires the consulting firm of Burkhart, Abrams, Michaels, Douglas & Associates to \\"develop a new AOR approach\\" *1984 - Elvis Costello stops by with a box of records and plays DJ for an hour *1985 - WBRU is the first radio station shouted-out in Fishbone's single \\"?

Although 95.5 WBRU first aired in February 1966 and Birthday Bash concerts are promoted with an anniversary date that dates to that year (i.e. 2016 as the station's 50th anniversary), the November date instead celebrates the first broadcasts made on its Brown Network ancestor in November 1936. From 2007 to 2010, the Birthday Bash was split from one concert to multiple concerts throughout November. Previously, the only time it was split was in 2001 where two concerts were held.

Biography Shchusev studied under Leon Benois and Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1891-1897\\\\. From 1894 to 1899, he travelled in North Africa and Central Asia. Shchusev was a diligent student of old Russian art and won public acclaim with his restoration of the 12th-century St. Basil Church in Ovruch, Ukraine. He dwelt on 15th-century Muscovite architecture to design the Trinity Cathedral in Pochayiv Lavra and a memorial church on the Kulikovo Field. He was then commissioned by the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna to design a cathedral for Marfo-Mariinsky Convent in Moscow. The result was a charming medieval structure of the purest Novgorodian style (1908-1912).Brumfield, 2016: p. 16-24. Shchusev embarked upon his most wide- scale project in 1913, when his design for the Kazan Railway Station won a contest for a Moscow terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This Art Nouveau design fused elements of the Kremlin towers and traditional Tatar architecture in one of the most imaginative Revivalist designs ever put to execution. The construction of the railway station, however, was not finished until 1940. After briefly experimenting with Neoclassicism, Shchusev turned to Constructivism in the 1920s. He taught at Vkhutemas from 1920 through 1924. Upon Lenin's death in 1924, he was asked to design a mausoleum for him. It took him just several days to come up with an original architectural solution blending Constructivist elements with features taken from some ancient mausoleums, i.e., the Step Pyramid and the Tomb of Cyrus. There are two notable Constructivist designs of Shchusev: the Ministry of Agriculture or Narkomzem in Moscow (1928-1933) and the Institute of Resorts in Sochi (1927-1931), considered to be a major source for Alvar Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium. A 1941 portrait by Mikhail Nesterov. After the mausoleum commission, Shchusev was cherished by the Communist authorities. In 1926, he was nominated director of the Tretyakov Gallery. He was appointed head of the group that designed major bridges and apartment complexes in Moscow. His name was attached to the luxurious designs of the Hotel Moskva just a few steps from the Kremlin (1930-1938) and the NKVD headquarters on Lubyanka Square (1940-1947). Some say that he was the first to come up with the idea of Gothic skyscrapers in Moscow. It is debated whether these Stalinist designs were really Shchusev's or if they were actually executed by his disciples. The discussion of their artistic merits was exacerbated when the Moscow authorities announced their intention to demolish the Hotel Moskva in 2004. Actually, all these designs, whether executed for Moscow, Tbilisi (such as a building of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute), or Tashkent, featured Shchusev's trademark blend of Neoclassical elements with national architectural traditions. It is believed that the author of the Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow was one of the Shchusev's office architect Isidore Frantsuz. According to Russian architectural historian Alexei Klimenko: \\"It was proven by architectural critic Selim Khan-Magomedov. The Soviet government did not want the public to know about the Jewish origin of the true author, and the work was credited to Shchusev\\".–í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å ¬´–¢—Ä—É–¥–∞¬ª: –ß—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Å –º–∞–≤–∑–æ–ª–µ–µ–º –©—É—Å–µ–≤–∞? A. Klimenko, who was a graduate student at the institute, where Khan- Magomedov was working then, said that Khan-Magomedov \\"found the drawings, on which the name\\" Frantsuz \\" was scraped and on the top of it was written \\" A. Shchusev. \\" For that Khan-Magomedov was almost thrown out of the Communist party, and there was a scandal on the grounds of nationality: don‚Äôt trash their Jewish surnames into history of Soviet architecture in general, and the Red Square in particular\\". There is another known case where Shchusev was accused of plagiarism. In 1937, the architects L. I. Saveliev and O. A. Stapran appealed to the Union of Architects with a complaint against Schusev alleging that he assumed the authorship of their \\"Moscow\\" hotel project. As a result of that complaint Shchusev was removed from the board of the Moscow branch of the Union of Architects. In 1946, Shchusev established the Museum of Architecture, which helped to preserve remnants of demolished medieval churches and monasteries. His last works of importance were the Komsomolskaya station of the Moscow Metro, whose decoration was stylized after 17th-century Muscovite churches, and the plan for reconstruction of Novgorod after the ancient city had been destroyed by the Nazis (in recognition of that, one of Novgorod's modern streets was named after him). Shchusev died four years after the end of World War II and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

It is a subject of some controversy. On one side, many magicians argue that methods represent \\"intellectual property\\" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as \\"exposure\\" and many magicians react angrily to it. While many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all \\"exposure\\", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works ‚Äì works with living and identifiable creators. Possible legal protection There are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. Copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. =Copyright= Under the Berne Convention, member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is \\"fixed\\", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., copyright law only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves. The idea‚Äìexpression dichotomy specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright. Another potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose & Her Shadow. Magic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act against America Online to remove a video from their website. = Patents = An invention or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially patentable in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works. Notably, in 1938, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was sued by magician Horace Goldin over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a Sawing a woman in half trick.Goldin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (D.N.Y. 1938) The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods. Examples of patented inventions for conjuring include: * The Svengali card deck, patented by Burling Hull in 1909 * A device to perform the quick-change magic trick under * The theatrical effect of Pepper's ghost from the 1800s * John Gaughan's levitation apparatus, filed in 1993 * David Merlini escape artist's Hyberna -frozen in ice- effect, patent filed in 2001, for the method of \\"freezing\\" an alive being in a tank of water. * Horace Goldin applied for a patent for Sawing a woman in half in September 1921 and was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923. Although the patent blocked other magicians using his ideas it also aided people seeking to expose the method to the trick. =Trade secret and contract law= Magic methods are effectively forms of trade secret and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of \\"confidentiality\\" and \\"contract law\\" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information ‚Äì i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright. A company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates. A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a non- disclosure agreement before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. Information which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the public domain may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of confidentiality. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available. Court cases Court cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of case law. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include: * 1920s‚Äì1930s: Horace Goldin was involved in many legal actions related to the Sawing a woman in half illusion, including a successful unfair competition claim in 1922 against the makers of a film that exposed the method,Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays, New York (Dec 1922), referenced in The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201, and also in Advanced Torts: Cases and materials, (Law Casebook Series), Carolina Academic Press, (2007) and an unsuccessful unfair competition claim in 1938 against the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for exposing the secret in an advertisement for cigarettes.Goldin v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (SDNY 1938). The latter case was dismissed because Goldin's 1923 patent on the illusion revealed its mechanism to the public. * 1943: Charles \\"Think-a-Drink\\" Hoffman sued Maurice Glazer for violation of his copyright and trademark rights in his \\"Think-a-Drink\\" act. The Supreme Court of Florida upheld the trademark decision for Hoffman, but held that Hoffman's act was not \\"dramatic\\" enough to qualify for Copyright Protection under the 1909 definition.Glazer v. Hoffman, 153 Fla. 809 (1943) * 1947: The Harold Lloyd Corporation sued Universal Pictures Company for copyright violation of its film \\"Movie Crazy\\". In the infringed scenes, the protagonist accidentally puts on a magician's coat and he is plagued by a series of bewildering magic effects.Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 162 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1947) * 1998: Joseph Harrison and a number of other magicians filed an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit against SF broadcasting and Fox Broadcasting for exposing the secrets to a number of illusions on their Masked Magician special.Harrison v. SF Broadcasting. No. Civ. A. 98‚Äì1107. 1998 WL 355462 (E.D. La. Jun. 30, 1998). Chief Judge Sear stated \\"I recognize that Plaintiffs' Petition seeks to redress the betrayal of the honor code among magicians, but such redress is not available here because no legal rights have been violated.\\" They sought relief for violation of the magicians' honor code under Louisiana's abuse of rights doctrine, but were denied because the doctrine only applies to contracts and property. * 1998: Andr√© Kole tried to sue the makers of the Masked Magician television specials to prevent exposure of the Table of Death trick. (available only at the LA County Clerk of the Court's office * 2007: Japanese magicians sued local TV networks for exposing coin tricks. * 2014: Teller sued Gerard Dogge for copyright infringement. U.S. District Judge James Mahan sided with Teller. Codes of practice The most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of ethics or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the International Brotherhood of Magicians, has a Code of Ethics which states: :All members of the International Brotherhood of Magicians agree to oppose the willful exposure to the public of any principles of the Art of Magic, or the methods employed in any magic effect or illusion. The Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that \\"exposing\\" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians. However, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.

Biography =Early life= Crockett was born in Bristol, Virginia, to Charles S. and Josie E. Crockett. As a youth, he became a fan of pro wrestling, which had thrived during the 1920s with such grapplers as Strangler Lewis and Joe Stecher dominating the scene. =Career= In the early 1930s, a dispute arose over the bookings of new wrestling sensation Jim Londos, so New York City promoter Jack Curley negotiated an alliance between various regional managers that enabled Londos to travel the country as champion while allowing the promoters to share profits evenly across the regions. As a result of this arrangement, new wrestling \\"territories\\" emerged across the U.S., and in 1935, a 25-year-old Crockett, who had also served as a concert promoter while also owning a theater and a restaurant, decided to set up a permanent wrestling shop based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The organization, known as Jim Crockett Promotions, scheduled wrestling events in both Carolinas, as well as in Virginia, under the banner of Eastern States Championship Wrestling. Over the next decade, ESCW featured some of the top wrestling stars of the day. Then in 1948, wrestling's top promoters gathered in Waterloo, Iowa to form the industry's first true governing body, known as the National Wrestling Alliance. As the dominant force representing the Carolina region, Jim Crockett Promotions soon became an important member of the NWA, with Crockett serving as a chief lieutenant under longtime NWA President and leading St. Louis promoter Sam Muchnick. Over the next 25 years, Crockett's Carolina territory reigned among the most successful regions in the NWA, as he regularly sold out the 16,000-seat Greensboro Coliseum featuring such stars as Johnny Weaver, Rip Hawk, Swede Hanson, and Gene & Ole Anderson on his Championship Wrestling program. =Ice hockey= The championship trophy of the Southern Hockey League was named the James Crockett Cup. =Baseball= In 1976, the Crockett family purchased the Asheville Orioles and renamed them the Charlotte Orioles. They also saved the historic Calvin Griffith Park from being torn down and restored it to preserve its history. It was renamed Jim Crockett Memorial Park, and then DBA \\"Crockett Park\\" in 1977. The stadium was set on fire in 1984, three weeks before baseball was set to open. =Death= By the early 1970s, an ailing Crockett was forced to retire, as his son-in-law John Rigley had begun to take over many of the territory's responsibilities. Crockett died on April 1, 1973, and control of the company was then ceded to his son, 28-year-old Jim Crockett, Jr., who took over the promotion and ultimately renamed it \\"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling.\\" Jim Crockett Promotions would eventually hold a tag team tournament from 1986 through 1988 in honor of him called the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2015. =Personal life= He was married to Elizabeth Jackson Eversole Crockett, with whom he had four children: James Allen Crockett, Jr., David Finley Crockett, Charles J. \\"Jackie\\" Crockett, and Frances Earl Crockett. The Crockett Foundation Established in 1931, the Crockett Foundation is a non- profit organization that seeks to financially assist US military veterans who have returned home from service. The organization is named after Jim Crockett Sr. and maintains a strong association to professional wrestling and baseball. Various figures from the pro wrestling industry have endorsed Crockett Foundation.

Intended to use the new 24-cylinder Pratt & Whitney X-1800 engine, this proposal, which was for an aircraft substantially similar to the P-38, was assigned the designation XP-49, while the competing Grumman Model G-46 was awarded second place and designated XP-50. History Ordered in October 1939 and approved on January 8, 1940, the XP-49 was to feature a pressurized cockpit and armament of two cannon and four machine guns. Two months into the contract, a decision was made to substitute the Continental XI-1430-1 (or IV-1430) for the X-1800. The XP-49, 40-3055, first flew on 11 November 1942. The prototype force-landed on 1 January 1943, when the port landing gear failed to lock down due to combined hydraulic and electrical system failures.http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/AARmonthly/Jan1943S.htm The XP-49 next flew 16 February 1943, after repairs were made. Preliminary flight data showed performance was not sufficiently better than the production P-38, especially given the questionable future of the XI-1430 engine, to warrant disruption of the production line to introduce the new model aircraft. Consideration of quantity production was therefore abandoned. The aircraft was flown to Wright Field, and after various problems, further work on the XP-49 was halted, and Lockheed focused their energies on improving the P-38 instead.

Location It is situated on the central-southern African plateau, approximately , by road, north-east of Lusaka, the capital and largest city in Zambia. Kasama is located on the Great North Road from Mpika through Kasama to Mbala and on to Mpulungu, at the tip of Lake Tanganyika. Population The city population grew considerably in the 1970s and 1980s after construction of the TAZARA Railway through the city, and the tarring of the Great North Road, Zambia. Its population, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, was 74,243 in 2000 and had increased to 113,779 in 2010.  Overview  Kasama is in the heartland of the Bemba ethnic group, whose Paramount Chief Chitimukulu maintains his headquarters from Malole, which is east of the city center. In 1898/1899 a crisis over the succession of the Chitimukulu led to Bishop Joseph 'Moto Moto' Dupont gaining the agreement of Bemba chiefs to the British colonial Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia, Robert Codrington taking control of the area. Codrington established a boma at Kasama and the town's central location as well as its closeness to Chitimukulu's court led to it eventually becoming the largest and dominant town of the north-eastern lobe of what became Northern Rhodesia, then later, Zambia.  Economic activities  The town has a few modern facilities, among them are a Shoprite Checkers branch, Budget Stores, a local supermarket called PJT and four bakeries. The town has branches of Zambian commercial banks including Zambia National Commercial Bank, National Savings & Credit Bank, Atlas Mara Bank Zambia Limited, Standard Chartered Zambia, Cavmont Bank, Barclays Bank of Zambia and Indo-Zambia Bank Limited. The town has VISA and ATM services. Most people in Kasama are not formally employed and they run small businesses to earn a living. Kasama has around six internet cafes where people can access internet services. The hospital is the Kasama General Hospital, that provides locals with health services. The city has a police station and several police posts. The available mobile telephone operators include MTN Group, Airtel Zambia and Zamtel. There are several Agri Based industries in Kasama, which include Northern Coffee Company Limited (NCCL), a subsidiary of Olam International, growing coffee at Kateshi Estates, and Kalungwishi Estates growing sugar cane and producing the Kasama Sugar brand.  Tribes  In as much as there could be other tribes, Kasama district is highly populated by the bemba speaking people.  Suburbs  Kasama has the following residential compounds within the district council boundaries: * Central Town (the largest) * New Town or Mbulo * Location * Mukulumpe * Chikumanino The compounds below are out of the council boundary: * Mulenga Hills * Jazz * Tazara * Misamfu * Milima * Chiba * Chitamba * Brown * Winberg * Kasama * Kungu * Mutale/Milenge * Chisanga * Soft Katongo * Lua Luo Transport Kasama is served by a good network of major highways, including (a) Kasama‚ÄìMpika Highway (b) Kasama‚ÄìMbala Highway (which are part of Zambia's Great North Road), (c) Kasama‚ÄìLuwingu Highway and (d) Kasama‚ÄìIsoka Highway. The gauge TAZARA Railway connects Tanzania to the north via Kasama, with Zambia Railways at Kapiri Mposhi to the south. Air transport is accessible through Kasama Airport. It can accommodate small aircraft, and it is undergoing an upgrade to be able to accommodate larger aircraft. It was expected to be ready by the end of 2017.  Recreation  Kasama recreational facilities include the Kasama golf club, which also offers tennis, volleyball, badminton, body building, and a small football ground with one stand that can seat less than a thousand people. The town has other football grounds where people can play soccer. There are resorts at Chishimba Falls and guest houses and lodges such as the Chinchi's Nest and Kings Guest House, and 3 nightclubs.  Rivers  Kasama district has five big rivers and these include, Chambeshi, Lukulu, Lukupa, Lubansenshi and Luombe. The Chishimba falls is found on the Luombe river and it is one of the major tourist attraction in Zambia.  Climate   World War I  At the end of World War I, when it consisted of a handful of government offices and a dozen stores, it was evacuated by its British population of a couple of dozen in the face of a surprise raid from the north-east by German East African forces under General Paul von Lettow- Vorbeck. Not knowing that the armistice had occurred in Europe the day before, the Germans took the abandoned town on 12 November 1918 and continued south- west (there was no battle at Kasama since the British imperial forces were at Abercorn), agreeing a cease-fire at the Chambeshi River on 14 November when they were informed of the German surrender in Europe. For further details, see Von Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial.  Art  Kasama is known for the Stone Age rock art in the surrounding area. The Chishimba Falls also lie near the town.

The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus. Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers, 1986 (), p. 51. During his first Crimean expedition, he relieved the siege of Chersonesos by the Scythian king Palacus and subdued his allies, the Tauri. He finished this campaign at Scythian Neapolis. During the second campaign, Diophantus checked another invasion of the Scythians, who had joined their forces with the Rhoxolanoi under Tasius. At one point during these campaigns he established a stronghold at Eupatorium on the eastern shore of the Crimea. Around 107 BC, Mithridates dispatched Diophantes to Panticapaeum with the task of persuading the Bosporan king Paerisades V to cede his kingdom to Mithridates. While he was in the city, the Scythians, led by a certain Saumacus, revolted and killed Paerisades, while Diophantes barely managed to escape to Chersonesos. Back in Pontus, Diophantes rallied his forces and sailed to Crimea with a large fleet. The Scythian uprising was put down and the Bosporan kingdom was reduced to a dependency of Pontus.

She is also best known as the lead vocalist behind the classic R&B; ballad, \\"A Dream\\" from the group's In a Special Way album and is also the co-writer of the group's 1982 breakthrough hit, \\"I Like It\\" and the number-one hit, \\"Time Will Reveal\\". Early life Etterlene \\"Bunny\\" DeBarge is the eldest of 10 children, born to Etterlene (n√©e) Abney and Robert DeBarge, Sr. While spending her initial childhood in Detroit, her family moved to Grand Rapids when she was 16. Bunny would later recall years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father, stating that he had started molesting her when she was seven and this carried on until she was 13. Bunny also detailed troubles in public school where she and her brothers were constantly bullied and taunted by black schoolmates for their multiracial ethnicity. Bunny found solace in music, singing in her uncle's church as a child. She and her brothers soon participated in several groups together in various times. In 1972, DeBarge dropped out of school and married her first husband, for whom she'd be the mother of two children (they later divorced). Since she wasn't into instruments like her brothers were, Bunny taught herself how to write songs and compose melodies, which later paid off as she got older. Music career In 1979, after a couple years watching her brothers Bobby and Tommy ride to musical stardom as members of the band Switch, Bunny teamed up with her three brothers Randy, Mark and El and became the DeBarges. They signed with Motown after their demo tape was passed off by Switch's Gregory Williams to Motown CEO Berry Gordy, who was left impressed by the siblings and soon put the band on a salary. Between 1979 and 1981, Bunny and her brothers worked behind the scenes mainly on the works of Switch, with Bunny in particular collaborating with her brother Bobby on songs such as \\"Hold On to My Love\\", \\"Love Over and Over Again\\" and \\"My Friend in the Sky\\". In 1981, Bunny co- produced the DeBarges' self-titled debut album and was featured on lead vocals alongside brother El on \\"Share My World\\" which they wrote. A year later, in 1982, the group brought along their teenage brother James, and shortened their name to just DeBarge. That year, they released their second album, All This Love, with which the siblings found musical success, particularly with \\"I Like It\\", for which Bunny wrote parts of the lyrics, alongside her brothers Randy and El. The group followed up this success with their third album, In A Special Way, in 1983. The album yielded another hit with Bunny as a lyricist, with the gospel-influenced \\"Time Will Reveal\\". The album also included several more highlights including two more Bunny-composed ballads, \\"Stay with Me\\" and \\"A Dream\\", the last song Bunny took lead vocals on. Like All This Love before it, In a Special Way went gold, paving the way for the group's biggest success in 1985 with the Rhythm of the Night album, with the title track becoming a top five crossover hit. Personal life Bunny DeBarge has been married twice. In several of DeBarge's albums, she is listed as Etterlene Jordan and is sometimes referred to as either Etterlene Jordan-Knight or Etterlene DeBarge Knight. Bunny is the mother of four children and a grandmother of fifteen and still lives in Michigan, having moved back to Grand Rapids after years living in California. Much like her brothers, Bunny DeBarge has dealt with drug issues, going back to her teen years, which started with marijuana and moving up to prescription medication during her heyday with DeBarge. It soon escalated to usage of cocaine. Bunny entered rehab several times to kick her habit. In 2008, she broke her silence issuing her autobiography, The Kept Ones, in which she talked about her father's abuse towards her and her siblings and her dealings with substance abuse.The Kept Ones on Amazon.com That year she appeared on the debut episode of the TV One series, Unsung, in which she talked about her childhood and her time with DeBarge, along with brothers Randy and James. The trio again appeared on TV three years later in September 2011, on the show Lifechangers alongside Bunny's daughter Janae. James entered the rehabilitation program but left a few hours later. Randy left a few days later. Bunny entered the rehabilitation program and completed her entire experience. After leaving the rehabilitation program in West Hollywood, California, Bunny has been touring and focusing on her new album.

Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858‚Äì1923), have identified him with a Scottish knight, Hugh of Eglinton, and advanced his authorship of several significant pieces of alliterative verse. Current opinion is that there is little evidence to support this. Evidence The little that is known about Huchoun comes from the Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun, which mentions: > Hucheon, > √æat cunnande was in littratur. > He made a gret Gest of Arthure > And √æe Awntyr of Gawane, > √ûe Pistil als of Suet Susane. > He was curyousse in his stille, > Fayr of facunde and subtile, > And ay to pleyssance hade delyte, > Mad in metyr meit his dyte > Litil or noucht neuir √æe lesse > Wauerande fra √æe suythfastnes. > :: (Cotton Manuscript book V. II, 4308-4318). Interest in the otherwise unknown figure of \\"Huchoun\\" - a diminutive form of \\"Hugh\\", i.e. \\"little Hugh\\" - was spurred largely by the work of George Neilson, a lawyer and antiquarian, who gave a series of lectures at Glasgow University in 1902 centred on the subject, and published a book the same year.George Neilson , Dumfriesshire & Galloway Natural History and Antiquarian Society Neilson, G. Huchoun of the Awle Ryale, the Alliterative Poet, Glasgow, 1902. Of the works Andrew of Wyntoun mentions, the easiest to identify was √ûe Pistil als of Suet Susane. This has been fairly firmly associated with The Pistel of Swete Susan, an alliterative poem surviving in 5 manuscripts.Peck, R. A. Epistle of Sweet Susan in Heroic Women for the Old Testament in Middle English Verse, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1991 The Gest of Arthure, also called Gest Historyalle and described by Wyntoun, has been more tentatively identified as the well-known Alliterative Morte Arthure (found in the Thornton manuscript of Lincoln Cathedral). Illustration from Cotton Nero A.x. the sole manuscript to contain the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Neilson attributed this poem, probably incorrectly, to Huchoun. The Awntyr of Gawane (literally the \\"Adventure of Gawain\\") is less certain. Neilson advanced that it represented the great alliterative work Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Huchoun was therefore also credited with Patience, Pearl, and Cleanness. The fact that a later hand had written \\"Hugo de\\" at the head of the manuscript of these works was also taken as supporting evidence. The output of the Pearl Poet, however, is linguistically very distinct from what seems to be the oldest versions of the works more solidly attributed to Huchoun, and this attribution is nowadays dismissed. More likely is the suggestion that the Awntyr of Gawane represents The Awntyrs off Arthure, an Arthurian poem in a rhymed alliterative stanza similar to Swete Susan, which has several variants in multiple manuscripts. Identity Beyond the matter of what he may have written, who Huchoun was is uncertain. William Dunbar, in his Lament for the Makaris, mentions a poet called \\"gude Sir Hew of Eglyntoun\\", whose works are now lost. Hugh of Eglington was a knight who was brother-in-law to Robert II of Scotland. Following suggestions made by earlier antiquarians, Neilson argued that Huchoun, \\"little Hugh\\", could be the same figure: given Hugh of Eglington's close connection with the king, and the fact that he was given safe conduct to visit London, the epithet \\"of the Awle Ryale\\" could be explained, if it was interpreted as \\"Aula Regalis\\" or \\"Royal Palace\\". The biggest problem with this identification is that the poems ascribed by Neilson to Huchoun / Hugh of Eglington are of varying dialects, none of them Scottish. Even the poem most likely to be authentically Huchoun's own work, the Pistel of Swete Susan, seems to be in a north Yorkshire dialect overlaying a Midland source. Gawain and the Green Knight and the other three poems in the Cotton Nero A.x manuscript have a clearly north-western provenance, while the Alliterative Morte Arthure is considered to originate in the East Midlands. Two possibilities suggested by Neilson are that a Scottish poet wrote in a southern dialect, perhaps after being educated in England, or that the Scotticisms were \\"translated\\" by later scribes. It seems a more likely suggestion either that Andrew of Wyntoun's poet, Huchoun, was not Scottish (and therefore not Sir Hugh), or that the poems he mentions were in fact other works now lost, rather than the great alliterative poems Neilson claimed they referred to. Other candidates for Huchoun from different parts of England have much less detailed evidence to prove their case. Current academic opinion takes the line that Huchoun, if he existed, may have written swete Susan but that evidence to link the same poet to other major alliterative works is tenuous at best.

Concept and creation Freya was created for the 2000 video game Final Fantasy IX. The original concept art for Freya was created by Yoshitaka Amano, and the final version was created by Toshiyuki Itahana, as well as Shunkou Murase and Shin Nagasawa, who also handled the in-game version of the character. Her character design was meant to strike a balance between realism and a comic-like style, while taking inspiration from the style employed for the characters in the film The Dark Crystal. Composer Nobuo Uematsu was asked to compose Garnet's theme song. She was initially known as Freija. She is a member of a race of anthropomorphic rats called Burmecians who mainly live in two cities, Burmecia and Cleyra. Her class is Dragon Knight. Appearances Freya appears in the video game Final Fantasy IX. She is originally from Burmecia, but when met in the game, she has not been home for years. When the man she loved, Sir Fratley, left on a mission but never returned, she left home until she discovered what became of him. After a period in Lindblum, she headed out to wander the world. Freya returns to Lindblum to compete in the \\"Festival of the Hunt\\" around the same time that Zidane and Tantalus return from their mission to kidnap Princess Garnet. Freya is reunited with Sir Fratley during Alexandria's attack on Cleyra. Her joy is cut short when he reveals that he has lost his memory and does not remember her at all. Freya is crestfallen, but when Fratley leaves again, she says nothing. She explains that she was just happy that he was alive. She is reunited with Fratley during the ending of the game in Burmecia. He has not regained his memories, but he falls back in love with Freya. Freya is one of the \\"strong, serious female\\" characters who permeate many player parties in the Final Fantasy series. She was preceded in her role by Rydia (as an adult) from Final Fantasy IV, Faris Scherwiz from Final Fantasy V, Celes Chere from Final Fantasy VI, Aerith Gainsborough from Final Fantasy VII, and Quistis Trepe from Final Fantasy VIII, and succeeded in the role by Lulu from Final Fantasy X, Fran from Final Fantasy XII, Oerba Yun Fang from Final Fantasy XIII, and Aranea Highwind from Final Fantasy XV (though in the case of the latter, she was merely a guest character, but nonetheless came the closest to filling that role). A figurine of Freya was announced in a compilation with Beatrix, and was slated to release in February 2020. Reception Freya has received generally positive reception, regarded as a fan favorite by Keegan Lee of RPGFan. Jef Rouner of the Houston Press ranked her among the most attractive furry characters, calling her one of his favorite Final Fantasy IX characters. He called her one of the most \\"romantic\\" characters on his list due to her \\"pale colors, tragic stoicism and the shock of emo hair that obscures most pictures of her.\\" Anthony John Agnello of GamesRadar+ calls her \\"Jim Hensonian\\", noting her \\"warm\\" mixture of human and animal traits. Developer Robert Boyd regarded her as one of the best female warriors in Japanese role-playing games. Brittany Vincent of SyFy Wire called it a \\"veritable crime\\" that Freya was absent from the Dissidia Final Fantasy franchise, calling her \\"awesome.\\" She noted that she needed \\"more time in the spotlight.\\" Richard Walls of Video Game Music Online noted how her musical theme captured her insecurities and solitude well and how it progressed to being more heroic as it progresses. He called it the \\"deepest musical portraits of any character\\" that composer Nobuo Uematsu had ever made. Julian Whitney, also of Video Game Music Online, similarly discussed her theme, noting its melancholy and sense of hope. They called the theme the standout of the soundtrack, citing Freya's \\"courage and perseverance.\\" Joshua Carpenter of RPGamer praised her, noting her quest as a standout aspect of the game. However, Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade felt that Freya was \\"completely squandered\\" in Final Fantasy IX. Nadia Oxford of USGamer felt similar, noting that she loves Dragoons and rodent-type characters, which made her feel disappointed in her lack of development. She also called her \\"the best\\" and showed appreciation for the fact that she is a positive depiction of rats. Steven Toast of RPGamer disagreed on her development, thinking she was handled well. He praised how she has a stronger side while having her softer, romantic side. Colin Stevens of Hardcore Gamer noted that despite Freya's design hearkening back to old Final Fantasy classes, the writers subvert expectations of these classes by giving them more development than people may have expected.

This Smithsonian Institution research program was founded with Congressional support in 1991, and was incorporated in 1997 as part of the National Zoological Park, located in Washington, D.C.; it came under the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, established in 2010. From an initial focus on the conservation biology of Neotropical songbirds, it now researches the role of disease in population declines in migratory birds, environmental challenges facing urban and suburban birds and their adaptation to changes in natural and anthropogenic habitats and climate, and the conservation biology of wetland birds. Their research group has long-term research programs dealing with migratory birds in both their breeding and non-breeding areas, with studies of how specific breeding and non-breeding populations are connected by migration. In 1998 it developed the Bird Friendly coffee program that fosters management practices at coffee farms that are good for birds while remaining marketable. Coffee grown under the program is certified as shade grown and organic, with purchases supporting the conservation of migratory birds. The criteria for Bird Friendly certification was developed from basic research on migratory bird-habitat relationships by Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center scientists. They sponsor advanced undergraduate and graduate students at collaborating institutions, as well as in-house post-doctoral fellowships. The center's education efforts include the creation of International Migratory Bird Day, a holiday which is celebrated on the second Saturday of May in the United States and Canada, and on the second Saturday of October in most of Latin America. Neighborhood Nestwatch, its community-based science and educational outreach program, involves volunteers in monitoring the reproductive success and survival of birds in their communities. Its Bridging the Americas/Unidos por las Aves program is an education program that partners elementary school classes in the Washington, D.C. area with classes in Latin America and the Caribbean. The goals of the program are # to teach students about the migratory birds that connect these two regions of the hemisphere and the need to protect their habitats, and # to stimulate an interest in learning about other countries and their cultures. Since 1993, over 17,000 students in grades 3 through 8 from 11 countries of the Americas have participated.

In general usage, the term \\"soil conditioner\\" is often thought of as a subset of the category soil amendments (or soil improvement, soil condition), which more often is understood to include a wide range of fertilizers and non-organic materials. Soil conditioners can be used to improve poor soils, or to rebuild soils which have been damaged by improper soil management. They can make poor soils more usable, and can be used to maintain soils in peak condition. Composition A wide variety of materials have been described as soil conditioners due to their ability to improve soil quality. Some examples include biochar, bone meal, blood meal, coffee grounds, compost, compost tea, coir, manure, straw, peat, sphagnum moss, vermiculite, sulfur, lime, hydroabsorbant polymers, and biosolids. Many soil conditioners come in the form of certified organic products, for people concerned with maintaining organic crops or organic gardens. Soil conditioners of almost every description are readily available from online stores or local nurseries as well as garden supply stores. Purpose =Soil structure= The most common use of soil conditioners is to improve soil structure. Soils tend to become compacted over time. Soil compaction impedes root growth, decreasing the ability of plants to take up nutrients and water. Soil conditioners can add more loft and texture to keep the soil loose. =Soil nutrients= For centuries people have been adding things to poor soils to improve their ability to support healthy plant growth. Some of these materials, such as compost, clay and peat, are still used extensively today. Many soil amendments also add nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, as well as beneficial bacteria. Additional nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, may be augmented by amendments as well. This enriches the soil, allowing plants to grow bigger and stronger. =Cation exchange= Soil amendments can also greatly increase the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils. Soils act as the storehouses of plant nutrients. The relative ability of soils to store one particular group of nutrients, the cations. The most common soil cations are calcium, magnesium, potassium, ammonium, hydrogen, and sodium. The total number of cations a soil can hold, its total negative charge, is the soil's cation exchange capacity. The higher the CEC, the higher the negative charge and the more cations that can be held and exchanged with plant roots, providing them with the nutrition they require. =Water retention= Soil conditioners may be used to improve water retention in dry, coarse soils which are not holding water well. The addition of organic material for instance can greatly improve the water retention abilities of sandy soils and they can be added to adjust the pH of the soil to meet the needs of specific plants or to make highly acidic or alkaline soils more usable. The possibility of using other materials to assume the role of composts and clays in improving the soil was investigated on a scientific basis earlier in the 20th century, and the term soil conditioning was coined. The criteria by which such materials are judged most often remains their cost- effectiveness, their ability to increase soil moisture for longer periods, stimulate microbiological activity, increase nutrient levels and improve plant survival rates. The first synthetic soil conditioners were introduced in the 1950s, when the chemical hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile was the most used. Because of their ability to absorb several hundred times their own weight in water, polyacrylamides and polymethacrylates (also known as hydroabsorbent polymers, superabsorbent polymers or hydrogels) were tested in agriculture, horticulture and landscaping beginning in the 1960s. Interest disappeared when experiments proved them to be phytotoxic due to their high acrylamide monomer residue. Although manufacturing advances later brought the monomer concentration down below the toxic level, scientific literature shows few successes in utilizing these polymers for increasing plant quality or survival. The appearance of a new generation of potentially effective tools in the early 1980s, including hydroabsorbent polymers and copolymers from the propenamide and propenamide-propenoate families, opened new perspectives. Application Soil conditioners may be applied in a number of ways. Some are worked into the soil with a tiller before planting. Others are applied after planting, or periodically during the growing season. Soil testing should be performed prior to applying a soil conditioner to learn more about the composition and structure of the soil. This testing will determine which conditioners will be more appropriate for the available conditions. Ecological concerns While adding a soil conditioner to crops or a garden can seem like a great way to get healthier plants, over-application of some amendments can cause ecological problems. For example, salts, nitrogen, metals and other nutrients that are present in many soil amendments are not productive when added in excess, and can actually be detrimental to plant health. (See fertilizer burn.) Runoff of excess nutrients into waterways also occurs, which is harmful to the water quality and through it, the environment.

To determine the number of decades between two frequencies (f_1 & f_2), use the logarithm of the ratio of the two values: *\\\\log_{10} (f_2/f_1) decades or, using natural logarithms: *\\\\ln f_2 - \\\\ln f_1\\\\over\\\\ln 10 decadesDavis, Don and Patronis, Eugene (2012). Sound System Engineering, p.13. . :How many decades is it from 15 rad/s to 150,000 rad/s? ::\\\\log_{10} (150000/15) = 4 dec :How many decades is it from 3.2 GHz to 4.7 MHz? ::\\\\log_{10} (4.7\\\\times10^6 / 3.2\\\\times10^9 ) = -2.83 dec :How many decades is one octave? ::One octave is a factor of 2, so \\\\log_{10} (2) = 0.301 decades per octave (decade = just major third + three octaves, 10/1 () = 5/4) To find out what frequency is a certain number of decades from the original frequency, multiply by appropriate powers of 10: :What is 3 decades down from 220 Hz? ::220 \\\\times 10^{-3} = 0.22 Hz :What is 1.5 decades up from 10? ::10 \\\\times 10^{1.5} = 316.23 To find out the size of a step for a certain number of frequencies per decade, raise 10 to the power of the inverse of the number of steps: :What is the step size for 30 steps per decade? :: 10^{1/30} = 1.079775 ‚Äì or each step is 7.9775% larger than the last. Graphical representation and analysis 1,10,100,1k,10k,100k using decades vs. 0,10,20,30,40,50 using linear scale Decades on a logarithmic scale, rather than unit steps (steps of 1) or other linear scale, are commonly used on the horizontal axis when representing the frequency response of electronic circuits in graphical form, such as in Bode plots, since depicting large frequency ranges on a linear scale is often not practical. For example, an audio amplifier will usually have a frequency band ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and representing the entire band using a decade log scale is very convenient. Typically the graph for such a representation would begin at 1 Hz (100) and go up to perhaps 100 kHz (105), to comfortably include the full audio band in a standard-sized graph paper, as shown below. Whereas in the same distance on a linear scale, with 10 as the major step-size, you might only get from 0 to 50. Bode plot showing the concept of a decade: each major division on the horizontal axis is one decade Electronic frequency responses are often described in terms of \\"per decade\\". The example Bode plot shows a slope of ‚àí20 dB/dec in the stopband, which means that for every factor-of-ten increase in frequency (going from 10 rad/s to 100 rad/s in the figure), the gain decreases by 20 dB. See also Other frequency ratio interval units include the cent (2^{1/1200}), the octave (2 = 1200 cents), and semitone (2^{1/12} = 100 cents). * * Octave * Savart Sources Category:Charts Category:Logarithmic scales of measurement ","title":"Decade (log scale)"},{"id":"2187252","text":"Ciphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably. A cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than , then this adversary is considered to have an \\"advantage\\" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.  Formal definitions  Security in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker. It is normally presented as a game, where the cryptosystem is considered secure if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly. The most common definitions used in cryptography are indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (abbreviated IND-CPA), indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1), and indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2). Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA1 secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA1 and IND-CPA secure. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the three definitions of security. = Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) = For a probabilistic asymmetric key encryption algorithm, indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger. For schemes based on computational security, the adversary is modeled by a probabilistic polynomial time Turing machine, meaning that it must complete the game and output a guess within a polynomial number of time steps. In this definition E(PK, M) represents the encryption of a message M under the key PK: #The challenger generates a key pair PK, SK based on some security parameter k (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes PK to the adversary. The challenger retains SK. #The adversary may perform a polynomially bounded number of encryptions or other operations. #Eventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts \\\\scriptstyle M_0, M_1 to the challenger. #The challenger selects a bit b \\\\scriptstyle \\\\in {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the challenge ciphertext C = E(PK, \\\\scriptstyle M_b) back to the adversary. #The adversary is free to perform any number of additional computations or encryptions. Finally, it outputs a guess for the value of b. A cryptosystem is indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attack if every probabilistic polynomial time adversary has only a negligible \\"advantage\\" over random guessing. An adversary is said to have a negligible \\"advantage\\" if it wins the above game with probability \\\\scriptstyle \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\epsilon(k), where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\epsilon(k) is a negligible function in the security parameter k, that is for every (nonzero) polynomial function \\\\scriptstyle poly() there exists \\\\scriptstyle k_0 such that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\epsilon(k) \\\\;<\\\\; \\\\left\\\\frac{1}{poly(k)}\\\\right for all \\\\scriptstyle k \\\\;>\\\\; k_0. Although the adversary knows \\\\scriptstyle M_0, \\\\scriptstyle M_1 and PK, the probabilistic nature of E means that the encryption of \\\\scriptstyle M_b will be only one of many valid ciphertexts, and therefore encrypting \\\\scriptstyle M_0, \\\\scriptstyle M_1 and comparing the resulting ciphertexts with the challenge ciphertext does not afford any non- negligible advantage to the adversary. While the above definition is specific to an asymmetric key cryptosystem, it can be adapted to the symmetric case by replacing the public key encryption function with an encryption oracle, which retains the secret encryption key and encrypts arbitrary plaintexts at the adversary's request.  Symmetric IND-CPA Game, Formalized  The adversarial process of performing a chosen-plaintext attack is usually outlined in the form of a Cryptographic Game. To test for symmetric IND-CPA, the game described above is defined. Let \\\\mathcal{K} be a key generation function, \\\\mathcal{E} be an encryption function, and \\\\mathcal{D} be a decryption function. Let \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\mathcal{E} = (\\\\mathcal{K}, \\\\mathcal{E}, \\\\mathcal{D}) be a symmetric encryption scheme. The game Guess is defined as: 300x300px As many times as it would like, an adversary selects two plaintext messages of its own choosing and provides them to the LR oracle which returns a ciphertext encrypting one of the messages. An adversary's advantage is determined by its probability of guessing the value of b, a value chosen at random at the beginning of the game which determines the message that is encrypted in the LR oracle. Therefore, its advantage is defined as: 456x456px = Indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack/adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1, IND-CCA2) = Indistinguishability under non- adaptive and adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA1, IND-CCA2) uses a definition similar to that of IND-CPA. However, in addition to the public key (or encryption oracle, in the symmetric case), the adversary is given access to a decryption oracle which decrypts arbitrary ciphertexts at the adversary's request, returning the plaintext. In the non-adaptive definition, the adversary is allowed to query this oracle only up until it receives the challenge ciphertext. In the adaptive definition, the adversary may continue to query the decryption oracle even after it has received a challenge ciphertext, with the caveat that it may not pass the challenge ciphertext for decryption (otherwise, the definition would be trivial). #The challenger generates a key pair PK, SK based on some security parameter k (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes PK to the adversary. The challenger retains SK. #The adversary may perform any number of encryptions, calls to the decryption oracle based on arbitrary ciphertexts, or other operations. #Eventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts \\\\scriptstyle M_0,\\\\, M_1 to the challenger. #The challenger selects a bit b ‚àà {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the \\"challenge\\" ciphertext C = E(PK, \\\\scriptstyle M_b) back to the adversary. #The adversary is free to perform any number of additional computations or encryptions. ##In the non-adaptive case (IND-CCA1), the adversary may not make further calls to the decryption oracle. ##In the adaptive case (IND-CCA2), the adversary may make further calls to the decryption oracle, but may not submit the challenge ciphertext C. #Finally, the adversary outputs a guess for the value of b. A scheme is IND-CCA1/IND- CCA2 secure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage in winning the above game. = Indistinguishable from random noise = Sometimes we need encryption schemes in which the ciphertext string is indistinguishable from a random string by the adversary. If an adversary is unable to tell if a message even exists, it gives the person who wrote the message plausible deniability. Some people building encrypted communication links prefer to make the contents of each encrypted datagram indistinguishable from random data, in order to make traffic analysis more difficult. Some people building systems to store encrypted data prefer to make the data indistinguishable from random data in order to make data hiding easier. For example, some kinds of disk encryption such as TrueCrypt attempt to hide data in the innocent random data left over from some kinds of data erasure. As another example, some kinds of steganography attempt to hide data by making it match the statistical characteristics of the innocent \\"random\\" image noise in digital photos. To support such deniable encryption systems, a few cryptographic algorithms are specifically designed to make ciphertext messages indistinguishable from random bit strings. Most applications don't require an encryption algorithm to produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits. However, some authors consider such encryption algorithms to be conceptually simpler and easier to work with, and more versatile in practice‚Äîand most IND- CPA encryption algorithms apparently do, in fact, produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits.  Equivalences and implications  Indistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of non-malleability under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete. The notation \\\\scriptstyle A \\\\;\\\\Rightarrow\\\\; B means that property A implies property B. \\\\scriptstyle A \\\\;\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\; B means that properties A and B are equivalent. \\\\scriptstyle A \\\\; ot \\\\Rightarrow\\\\; B means that property A does not necessarily imply property B. * IND-CPA \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Leftrightarrow semantic security under CPA. * NM-CPA (non-malleability under chosen plaintext attack) \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Rightarrow IND-CPA. * NM-CPA (non-malleability under chosen plaintext attack) \\\\scriptstyle ot \\\\Rightarrow IND-CCA2. * NM-CCA2 (non-malleability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Leftrightarrow IND-CCA2.

A medicine is injected into the vessels, which makes them shrink. It is used for children and young adults with vascular or lymphatic malformations. In adults, sclerotherapy is often used to treat spider veins, smaller varicose veins, hemorrhoidsWilliam R. Finkelmeier, Sclerotherapy, Ch. 12, ACS Surgery: Principles & Practice, 2004, WebMD (hardcover book) and hydroceles.Darren T Beiko, Aspiration and Sclerotherapy versus hydrocelectomy for treatment of hydroceles, Urology Vol 61, Issue 4 (Apr 2003) Sclerotherapy is one method (along with surgery, radiofrequency and laser ablation) for the treatment of spider veins, occasionally varicose veins, and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy, ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. Sclerotherapy often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities have been diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. Sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants has been shown to be effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions. Padbury A, Benveniste G L, Foam echosclerotherapy of the small saphenous vein, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Phlebology Vol 8, Number 1 (Dec 2004) However, some authors believe that sclerotherapy is not suitable for veins with reflux from the greater or lesser saphenous junction, or for veins with axial reflux. This is due to the emergence of more effective technologies, including laser ablation and radiofrequency, which have demonstrated superior efficacy to sclerotherapy for treatment of these veins.  Historical aspects  Sclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of spider veins and occasionally varicose veins for over 150 years. Like varicose vein surgery, sclerotherapy techniques have evolved during that time. Modern techniques including ultrasonographic guidance and foam sclerotherapy are the latest developments in this evolution. The first reported attempt at sclerotherapy was by D Zollikofer in Switzerland, 1682 who injected an acid into a vein to induce thrombus formation.Goldman, M., Sclerotherapy Treatment of varicose and telangiectatic leg vein, Hardcover Text, 2nd Ed, 1995 Both Debout and Cassaignaic reported success in treating varicose veins by injecting perchlorate of iron in 1853.Sharmi S, Cheatle T. Fegan's Compression Sclerotherapy of Varicose Veins, Hardcover Text, 2003. Desgranges in 1854 cured 16 cases of varicose veins by injecting iodine and tannin into the veins. This was approximately 12 years after the probable advent of great saphenous vein stripping in 1844 by Madelung. However, due to high rates of side-effects with the drugs used at the time, sclerotherapy had been practically abandoned by 1894.Coppleson VM, The Treatment of Varicose Veins by Injection, Hardcover text,2nd Ed 1929. With the improvements in surgical techniques and anaesthetics over that time, stripping became the treatment of choice. Work continued on alternative sclerosants in the early 20th century. During that time carbolic acid and perchlorate of mercury were tried and whilst these showed some effect in obliterating varicose veins, side-effects also caused them to be abandoned. Prof. Sicard and other French doctors developed the use of sodium carbonate and then sodium salicylate during and after the First World War. Quinine was also used with some effect during the early 20th century. At the time of Coppleson's book in 1929, he was advocating the use of sodium salicylate or quinine as the best choices of sclerosant. Further work on improving the technique and development of safer more effective sclerosants continued through the 1940s and 1950s. Of particular importance was the development of sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) in 1946, a product still widely used to this day. George Fegan in the 1960s reported treating over 13,000 patients with sclerotherapy, significantly advancing the technique by focussing on fibrosis of the vein rather than thrombosis, concentrating on controlling significant points of reflux, and emphasizing the importance of compression of the treated leg. The procedure became medically accepted in mainland Europe during that time. However it was poorly understood or accepted in England or the United States, a situation that continues to this day amongst some sections of the medical community. The next major development in the evolution of sclerotherapy was the advent of duplex ultrasonography in the 1980s and its incorporation into the practise of sclerotherapy later that decade.

Nouvelle technique d'obtention de la sclero-mousse, Phlebologie 1997; 53:129 further revolutionised the treatment of larger varicose veins with sclerotherapy. This has now been further modified by Whiteley and Patel to use 3 non-silicone syringes for more long lasting foam.  Methods  Injecting the unwanted veins with a sclerosing solution causes the target vein to immediately shrink, and then dissolve over a period of weeks as the body naturally absorbs the treated vein. Sclerotherapy is a non- invasive procedure taking only about 10 minutes to perform. The downtime is minimal, in comparison to an invasive varicose vein surgery. Sclerotherapy is the \\"gold standard\\" and is preferred over laser for eliminating large spider veins (telangiectasiae) and smaller varicose leg veins.Sadick N, Sorhaindo L, Laser Treatment of Telangiectatic and Reticular Veins, Ch 16, p157. The Vein Book / editor, John J. Bergan, 2007. Unlike a laser, the sclerosing solution additionally closes the \\"feeder veins\\" under the skin that are causing the spider veins to form, thereby making a recurrence of the spider veins in the treated area less likely. Multiple injections of dilute sclerosant are injected into the abnormal surface veins of the involved leg. The patient's leg is then compressed with either stockings or bandages that they wear usually for one week after treatment. Patients are also encouraged to walk regularly during that time. It is common practice for the patient to require at least two treatment sessions separated by several weeks to significantly improve the appearance of their leg veins. Sclerotherapy can also be performed using microfoam sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great and small saphenous veins.Paul Thibault, Sclerotherapy and Ultrasound-Guided Sclerotherapy, The Vein Book / editor, John J. Bergan, 2007 After a map of the patient's varicose veins is created using ultrasound, these veins are injected whilst real-time monitoring of the injections is undertaken, also using ultrasound. The sclerosant can be observed entering the vein, and further injections performed so that all the abnormal veins are treated. Follow-up ultrasound scans are used to confirm closure of the treated veins, and any residual varicose veins can be identified and treated.  Foam sclerotherapy  Foam sclerotherapyUltrasound Guided Sclerotherapy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkl6btffR0A is a technique that involves injecting ‚Äúfoamed sclerosant drugs‚Äù within a blood vessel using a pair of syringes ‚Äì one with sclerosant in it and one with gas (originally air). The original Tessari method has now been modified by the Whiteley-Patel modification which uses 3 syringes, all of which are silicone free. The sclerosant drugs (sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol) are mixed with air or a physiological gas (carbon dioxide) in a syringe or by using mechanical pumps. This increases the surface area of the drug. The foam sclerosant drug is more efficacious than the liquid one in causing sclerosis (thickening of the vessel wall and sealing off the blood flow), for it does not mix with the blood in the vessel and in fact displaces it, thus avoiding dilution of the drug and causing maximal sclerosant action. It is therefore useful for longer and larger veins. Experts in foam sclerotherapy have created ‚Äútooth paste‚Äù like thick foam for their injections, which has revolutionized the non-surgical treatment of varicose veins and venous malformations, including Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.  Clinical evaluations  A study by Kanter and Thibault in 1996 reported a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution. Padbury and Benveniste found that ultrasound guided sclerotherapy was effective in controlling reflux in the small saphenous vein. Barrett et al. found that microfoam ultrasound guided sclerotherapy was \\"effective in treating all sizes of varicose veins with high patient satisfaction and improvement in quality of life\\". A Cochrane Collaboration review of the medical literature concluded that \\"the evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery and thread veins.\\" A second Cochrane Collaboration review comparing surgery to sclerotherapy concluded that sclerotherapy has greater benefits than surgery in the short term but surgery has greater benefits in the longer term. Sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed. A Health Technology Assessment found that sclerotherapy provided less benefit than surgery, but is likely to provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux from the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions. It did not study the relative benefits of surgery and sclerotherapy in varicose veins with junctional reflux. This Health Technology Assessment monograph includes reviews of the epidemiology, assessment, and treatment of varicose veins, as well as a study on clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery and sclerotherapy The European Consensus Meeting on Foam Sclerotherapy in 2003 concluded that \\"Foam sclerotherapy allows a skilled practitioner to treat larger veins including saphenous trunks\\". A second European Consensus Meeting on Foam Sclerotherapy in 2006 has now been published.  Complications  Complications, while rare, include venous thromboembolism, visual disturbances, allergic reaction, thrombophlebitis, skin necrosis, and hyperpigmentation or a red treatment area. If the sclerosant is injected properly into the vein, there is no damage to the surrounding skin, but if it is injected outside the vein, tissue necrosis and scarring can result. Skin necrosis, whilst rare, can be cosmetically \\"potentially devastating\\", and may take months to heal. It is very rare when small amounts of dilute (<0.25%) sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is used, but has been seen when higher concentrations (3%) are used. Blanching of the skin often occurs when STS is injected into arterioles (small artery branches). Telangiectatic matting, or the development of tiny red vessels, is unpredictable and usually must be treated with repeat sclerotherapy or laser. Medscape. William R. Finkelmeier, What's New in ACS Surgery: Sclerotherapy. ACS Surgery 2003. [free signup required] Most complications occur due to an intense inflammatory reaction to the sclerotherapy agent in the area surrounding the injected vein. In addition, there are systemic complications that are now becoming increasingly understood. These occur when the sclerosant travels through the veins to the heart, lung and brain. A recent report attributed a stroke to foam treatment, although this involved the injection of an unusually large amount of foam. More recent reports have shown that bubbles from even a small amount of sclerosant foam injected into the veins quickly appear in the heart, lung and brain. The significance of this is not fully understood at this point and large studies show that foam sclerotherapy is safe. Sclerotherapy is fully FDA approved in the USA. Contraindications include: bed rest, severe systemic diseases, poor patient understanding, needle phobia, short life expectancy, late stage cancer, known allergy to the sclerosing agent, and treatment with tamoxifen.

It features Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, other regulars Thom Huge and Gregg Berger, and guest star Wolfman Jack. It originally aired on CBS on May 27, 1986. This was the fifth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. The story concerns the characters visiting a tropical vacation destination. The special was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and has been released on DVD.  Plot  Jon Arbuckle and Garfield take their third class airline trip to Paradise World, a cheapskate's version of Hawaii. When they arrived on the island, Jon and Garfield check in at a deserted motel and are soon disappointed to find out that there is no beach within sight of the motel, and only an empty swimming pool in the back. When Jon and Garfield enter their room, they find Odie hiding in their luggage. None of the trio has any fun until Jon, Garfield, and Odie plan to rent a car and search for a beach around the island. For a cheap price, they get a really nice and classic Chevrolet Bel Air to hit the beach and later begin to choose where to go when their car mysteriously speeds into a jungle on its own, stopping in the middle of a native village. Jon, Garfield, and Odie presume that they are in trouble until the natives begin kowtowing to their car. They meet the tribal chief (The High Ramma-Lamma) who explains that the villagers (The Ding-Dongs) learned English \\"from watching a lot of beach movies\\". In 1957, the Cruiser, a James Dean/Fonzie-styled legend, drove his car into the village and introduced the people to the 1950s pop culture. The Cruiser eventually saved the village by sacrificing himself and driving his car into a nearby volcano to prevent it from erupting. The village is now devoted to a 1950s lifestyle and believes that Jon's rental car is actually the same one the Cruiser owned. In the village, Jon and Garfield find romance with the tribal princess, Owooda, and her cat, Mai-Tai. Meanwhile, the chief orders the village idiot, Monkey, to fix the car with Odie's assistance. Suddenly, the volcano begins to erupt and Owooda tells Jon that she and Mai- Tai must sacrifice themselves to save the village. However, the volcano rejects Owooda and Mai-Tai, and the village shaman, Pigeon, interprets that it wants the car instead, and if it does not have the car within thirty seconds, it will blow the island to pieces. Monkey and Odie make their last attempt to get the car fixed, which still does not work until Odie successfully taps the distributor cap with a hammer. The car finally starts and zooms through the village and up the volcano with Monkey driving and Odie hanging onto the hood. The car plummets into the crater, the volcano finally erupts, and the Cruiser's spirit and car's ghost drift out, speed off, and vanish into the night sky; the volcano is now at peace. Monkey and Odie are presumed dead until Garfield sees them climb out of the crater unharmed. Jon, Garfield, and the other villagers carry Monkey and Odie back to the village in a hero's fashion.

It lies along Arkansas's National Scenic 7 Byway between Harrison and Jasper. The Marble Falls Post Office is located in the parking lot of the now defunct theme park called Dogpatch USA. For a time, the town was known as Dogpatch to promote the theme park. Marble Falls is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area. History =Settlement= A Choctaw Indian named Ah-Che-To-Mah was the first settler known to have acquired title to land in the vicinity of Marble Falls. The waterfall once supplied power for a flour mill, cotton gin, and a saw mill. Peter Beller built the original water-powered grist mill there circa, and this mill was later rebuilt and remodeled by several different owners. =Marble City, Arkansas (1840 to 1883)= The community was originally named Marble City, after the marble that was quarried nearby. Marble City became known as a health resort in the 1880s, through the advertisements of businessmen such as Dr. Silas Scruggs Stacey, proprietor of the Stacey family store and provider of Dr. S. S. Staceys Sulpher Mountain Bitters (which sold briskly for $1 per bottle). In 1836, William Harp and his brothers, Elijah and Samuel, with Peter Bellah quarried a large block of marble at Marble City by drilling and wedging. They put the marble on a log wagon and, with ten yoke of oxen to pull it, moved it 60 miles across the Boston Mountains to the Arkansas River near Clarksville, where it was shipped to Washington, D.C. The block of marble (with\\" Arkansas\\" chiseled on it), along with other memorial stones, is located on the 30 foot level of the Washington Monument. =Willcockson, Arkansas (1883-1934)= The first post office was established September 24, 1883, and the first postmaster, Mander Willcockson, officially renamed the community Willcockson. On October 29, 1917, Ida T. Chesbro was appointed U. S. Postmaster of Willcockson. Absalom C. Phillips,a local preacher, added the cotton gin about 1890. After 1900, the town began to fade away, and the mills and gin were destroyed sometime in the early 1900s. By 1915, many began to leave the area due to economic depression. =Marble Falls, Arkansas (1934-1966 and 1997 to present)= Albert Raney, Sr., who became postmaster in 1934, had the official name changed to Marble Falls.Lackey, Walter F. History of Newton County, Arkansas, Point Lookout, MO: S of O Press, 1950. =Dogpatch, Arkansas (1966-1997)= When the Raney property was purchased in 1966 by the developers of Dogpatch USA, Governor Orval Faubus and some developers had the area's postal designation changed to Dogpatch, and it would appear that way on highway maps. The theme park closed in 1993, and in 1997 the citizens of the area voted unanimously to change the postal designation back to Marble Falls, the name it has today. =Skiing (1972-1980s)= The only lift serviced skiing ever in Arkansas was offered at the Marble Falls Resort beginning circa 1972 and lasting until the 1980s.

Colt manufactured the launcher for field testing during the Vietnam era. After problems with the experimental design were discovered, the XM148 was replaced by AAI Corporation's conceptually similar M203 design, currently the primary grenade launcher used by the US armed forces and others today. Description AR-15 rifle. The Colt XM148 grenade launcher was created by Colt's Design Project Engineer, gun designer Karl R. Lewis. The May 1967 \\"Colt's Ink\\" newsletter announced that he had won a national competition for his selection and treatment of materials in the design. The newsletter stated in part, \\"In only 47 days, he wrote the specifications, designed the launcher, drew all the original prints, and had a working model built.\\" The weapon was designed for installation below the barrel of M16-type rifles, and was intended to replace the stand-alone M79 correcting the problem of grenadiers relying on pistols as a secondary weapon. In July 1966 the US Government contracted Colt Firearms to provide nearly 20,000 XM-148s with the weapon arriving in South Vietnam in December 1966. The weapon was pulled from service in the fall of 1967.p. 38 Walter, John Rifles of the World Krause Publications, 25 Mar. 2006 Originally made for use with the M16 Rifle, the XM148 was used by US Special Forces in conjunction with the XM177E2 and the Australian Special Air Service Regiment in conjunction with the modified L1A1 and Sterling Submachine Gun.Neville, Leigh Guns of the Special Forces 2001 ‚Äì 2015 Casemate Publishers, 31 Mar 2016 The weapon was also adopted by the United States Air Force Security Forces in 1968. Problems The launcher's barrel could slide forward to accept a single 40 mm round into the breech. It came with a primitive version of the quadrant sight later used with the M203. It differed from the later model by featuring an external cocking handle and an extended trigger that allowed the weapon to be fired without removing the hand from the rifle's pistol grip. This same extended trigger was also one source of the weapon's problems as it allowed accidental discharges of a loaded weapon if caught by tree branches, gear, or anything else capable of overcoming the 6 to 11 pound trigger pull. Another problem with the weapon was that it was overcomplicated compared to the M203. It was difficult to disassemble and had many small parts that could be easily lost while cleaning the weapon in the field. Where the M203 broke down into receiver group, barrel group, hand guard group and quadrant sight (the quadrant sight being the smallest piece), the XM148 broke down into barrel, pistol grip, receiver, hand guard, quadrant sight, and several small pins and clips. These issues led the U.S. military to adopt the M203 over the XM148, though the U.S. Air Force did keep a number of the XM148s. In fact U.S. Air Force Security Forces were still being trained on the XM148 in lieu of the M203 as late as 1989. Some security police units still had them in their armories until the 1990s.

My Life with Master is a game about role-playing the servants or minions of an evil Master or Mistress. The game won several awards, and reviewers recognized it as well-written. As of 2018, the game is only available as a PDF file download from the publisher. Gameplay The prototypical setting of the role-playing game is in an unspecified Central European country in the early 19th century. Players in the game portray the Igor-like minions of an evil Master (or Mistress) who preys on the nearby Townsfolk. Like most role-playing games, there is a Gamemaster (GM). In this case the GM plays the part of the Master. However, the GM and players together are supposed to \\"design\\" the Master, in terms of defining his \\"Wants\\", \\"Needs\\", \\"Aspect\\", and \\"Type\\". These traits have no explicit mechanical effect, but are used to define the desires and mannerisms of the Master and how he interacts with the Townsfolk and his minions. Masters have two game statistics, \\"Fear\\" (a measure of his power over minions) and \\"Reason\\" (how much minions and Townsfolk can resist the Master's control over them). In contrast, the Master's minions, the characters portrayed by the players, are defined (in terms of game statistics) by their levels of \\"Weariness\\" and \\"Self-loathing\\", and the connections of \\"Love\\" that they have (successfully or unsuccessfully) tried to make with the Townsfolk. Self-loathing is a measure of the power that a minion has to intimidate the Townsfolk, while Weariness limits their abilities to complete their tasks. Love allows minions to resist their Master and his demands on them. Gameplay is generally resolved through a series of \\"scenes\\". A player describes what their minion is trying to do, be it carrying out their Master's wishes or trying to resist him, interacting with the Townsfolk, attempting an act of Love (which could result in increasing their \\"Love\\" trait, or increasing their \\"Self-loathing\\" if the attempt fails), etc. A series of dice rolls are used to determine success or failure, and then the scene is played out according to that outcome. Unlike other role-playing games that may have long campaigns, My Life with Master games are typically designed to end after a small number of playing sessions. As one reviewer stated, My Life with Master \\"strives to tell a story, and stories have endings.\\" Usually, a game culminates with the death of the Master at the hands of one (or more) of his minions. Sometimes, the Master dies because the Townsfolk are \\"sick of his predations\\" and \\"storm his domicile -- pitchforks in hand and torches aflame\\". Some or all of the players' characters might also meet their end in the hands of the Townsfolk, or the Master kills them as they try to resist his commands and suffer the consequences of their failure. Critical reception My Life with Master won the 2004 Diana Jones Award. In addition, it also won the 2003 Out of the Box Award for Best Sui Generis RPG and the 2003 Indie Roleplaying Game of the Year. Steve Darlington, in his review, stated that \\"even if you never play this game, you will be smarter simply for having read it\\" since \\"it quickly becomes hard to distinguish [Czege's] choice of attributes from a high-level academic deconstruction of the character tropes in gothic horror films at a level which could easily be found on a college reading list.\\" He also said that it is \\"one of the very few horror games that may actually need disclaimers, and maybe even safe words too\\" for its \\"darker subtext\\" about escaping from abusive relationships. According to Heather Barnhorst \\"Czege writes with wit and doesn't fear to let his understanding of game theory shine through. Colin Theriot's illustrations evoke exactly the right mood for the setting and are enjoyable as stand-alone art.\\" Reviewer Matthew Pook warned that \\"Despite the simplicity of the [game] mechanics ... they are not as clearly written as they need to be ... The GM will need to make a close read of the otherwise well- written text to help grasp how the outcome of a scene will alter a minion's statistics.\\" He concluded his review stating \\"although not going to be everyone's cup of tea, My Life With Master is the most interesting roleplaying game released this year [2003] and perhaps the most challenging.\\" Game designer Greg Costikyan has praised My Life with Master for the way it \\"evokes emotions and feelings rare in games\\", and considers it to work in part because the Gothic horror theme has \\"a defined narrative arc: hubris and terror, followed by a fall\\".

It is Campbell's feature film directorial debut. The film was co-written by David Goodman and co-stars Ted Raimi.  Plot  Bruce Campbell plays William Cole, the wealthy CEO of a U.S. drug company who travels to Bulgaria with his wife, Jackie in the hopes of diversifying his company's financial interests. Cole is a stereotypical ugly American who constantly complains about the lack of Americanization of the former communist country. They're driven to a hotel by a taxi driver, and former KGB agent, named Yegor Stragov, in which Yegor gives William a ring to give to Jackie. While William is at the construction of a subway, Jackie secretly cheats on William with Yegor. William gets back to the hotel and bumps into the hotel maid and gypsy, Tatoya, who kills men that date and dump her. Jackie then comes in, catches William kissing Tatoya and dumps him. William chases Tatoya, who had taken William's money and ring (which is revealed to be Tatoya's that she gave to Yegor when they dated), and Tatoya knocks him in the head with a pipe outside the hotel. Yegor witnesses this and so Tatoya kills Yegor with his own gun. A vengeful Jackie has Cole's life support plug pulled in hospital, and then goes to Gypsy Town where Tatoya lives and attempts to kill her, only to have Tatoya kill her by throwing her down a flight of stairs. Meanwhile, William wakes up in the warehouse of a Russian scientist named Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, and his idiotic assistant Pavel, who had taken damaged parts of William's brain and replaced it with healthy tissue from Yegor's. When William runs out of the warehouse, he discovers he can hear Yegor's voice in his head, and they both plan to \\"get the woman that killed us both\\". Jackie, who had also been picked up by Dr. Ivanov and Pavel, has her brain put inside a robot, and so she escapes and also plans to exact revenge on Tatoya. William/Yegor and Robo-Jackie chase Tatoya around town. William gets involved in a car crash with his foot underneath a car and Tatoya makes another attempt to kill William by setting the leaking car gasoline alight. Jackie saves him and is presumed dead in the explosion. After avoiding some bar punks that believe William \\"raped Tatoya on her wedding day\\", William/Yegor begin suffering brain damage due to their cells not able to coexist in the same head. Jackie, who had survived the explosion, appears and attempts to kill Tatoya by throwing her off a bridge, until Jackie stabs her brain, causing her to malfunction, and has Jackie thrown off the bridge. William chases Tatoya through the subway construction and the sewer and finally kills Tatoya by dropping her in sewer river, after obtaining the ring back. William and Jackie then confess their love for each other before Jackie's batteries finally die, as does William due to the brain cells of him and Yegor. Pavel brings William, Jackie and Tatoya's body back to Dr. Ivanov to fix them, as he had earlier found a way to make William and Yegor's brain cells coexist in the same head. The movie ends with William back in the U.S. six months later, still sharing his body with Yegor's brain. He goes to a brain trauma benefit with Jackie, whose brain had been transferred into Tatoya's body.

It was originally supposed to take place in East L.A., but after the fall of communism it was shot in Bulgaria instead, in order to save production costs.  Release  The production was financed in part by the Sci Fi Channel, where it was aired for the first time on television on September 25, 2005. It premiered on April 3, 2005 at the IHouse in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was supposed to premiere that same night at the Broadway Theater in Pitman, New Jersey; however, that theater went bankrupt earlier in the week and a new venue was found (the IHouse). Campbell then took the film with him on his book tour and it was shown at a limited number of theaters throughout the summer of 2005.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 33% of 12 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.9/10. Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"The story is pretty ridiculous from start to finish, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since the film doesn't take itself seriously at all.\\" Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"a decent and diverting piece of work from perhaps the hardest-working man in movies.\\" Negative reviews came from Dennis Harvey of Variety, who called it \\"a comedy that doesn't build, lacks structural integrity, and often falls flat. But it's also winningly loopy, with bizarre incidental ideas and performance riffing making for a series of parts that almost make up for the faults of the whole\\", and Mark de la Vi√±a of San Jose Mercury News, who called it \\"an unapologetically sloppy jumble of Roger Corman-style antics that could only hope to inspire their own drinking game.\\" Adaptations Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comic book series based on the film.

It consists of a number of elements, for example; warning/evacuation, search and rescue, providing immediate assistance, assessing damage, continuing assistance and the immediate restoration or construction of infrastructure (i.e. provisional storm drains or diversion dams).The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food, to establishing semi-permanent settlement in camps and other locations. It also may involve initial repairs to damaged or diversion to infrastructure. The focus in the response phase is on putting people safe, prevent next disasters and meeting the basic needs of the people until more permanent and sustainable solutions can be found. The main responsibility to address these needs and respond to a disaster lies with the government or governments in whose territory the disaster has occurred. In addition, Humanitarian organizations are often strongly present in this phase of the disaster management cycle, particularly in countries where the government lacks the resources to respond adequately to the needs.  Definition  A \\"disaster\\", noun, is defined as a calamitous event, especially one occurring suddenly and causing great loss of life, damage or hardship such as a flood, aircraft crash or an angry person. \\"Response\\" is defined (in this context) as: Noun: An answer or reply, as in words or in some action. The Business Dictionary provide a more comprehensive definition for \\"disaster response\\";Definition: disaster response, BusinessDictionary.com. Aggregate of decisions and measures to (1) contain or mitigate the effects of a disastrous event to prevent any further loss of life and/or property, (2) restore order in its immediate aftermath, and (3) re-establish normality through reconstruction and re- rehabilitation shortly thereafter. The first and immediate response is called emergency response. The Johns Hopkins and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)Public Health Guide for Emergencies, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2013. state: \\"The word disaster implies a sudden overwhelming and unforeseen event. At the household level, a disaster could result in a major illness, death, a substantial economic or social misfortune. At the community level, it could be a flood, a fire, a collapse of buildings in an earthquake, the destruction of livelihoods, an epidemic or displacement through conflict. When occurring at district or provincial level, a large number of people can be affected.\\"24 Disaster Definitions, The Johns Hopkins and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. A recent case study of a disaster response undertaken by the IFRC can be viewed here.Haiti case study, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The level of disaster response depends on a number of factors and particular situation awareness. Studies undertaken by Son, Aziz and Pe√±a-Mora (2007) shows that \\"initial work demand gradually spreads and increases based on a wide range of variables including scale of disaster, vulnerability of affected area which in turn is affected by population density, site-specific conditions (e.g. exposure to hazardous conditions) and effects of cascading disasters resulting from inter-dependence between elements of critical infrastructure\\". In the British Government's Emergency Response and Recovery guidance, disaster response refers to decisions and actions taken in accordance with the strategic, tactical and operational objectives defined by emergency responders. At a high level these will be to protect life, contain and mitigate the impacts of the emergency and create the conditions for a return to normality. Response encompasses the decisions and actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days‚Äîrapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (e.g. fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (e.g. disruption, media interest).Emergency Response and Recovery, Cabinet Office, 29 October 2013. Common objectives for responders are: * saving and protecting human life; * relieving suffering; * containing the emergency ‚Äì limiting its escalation or spread and mitigating its impacts; * providing the public and businesses with warnings, advice and information; * protecting the health and safety of responding personnel; * safeguarding the environment; * as far as reasonably practicable, protecting property; * maintaining or restoring critical activities; * maintaining normal services at an appropriate level; * promoting and facilitating self-help in affected communities; * facilitating investigations and inquiries (e.g. by preserving the scene and effective records management); * facilitating the recovery of the community (including the humanitarian assistance, economic, infrastructure and environmental impacts); * evaluating the response and recovery effort; and * identifying and taking action to implement lessons identified.  Disaster response planning  The United States National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600 Standard (NFPA, 2010) specify elements of an emergency response, as: defined responsibilities; specific actions to be taken (which must include protective actions for life safety); and communication directives. Within the standard, NFPA recognize that disasters and day-to-day emergencies are characteristically different. Nevertheless, the prescribed response elements are the same. In support of the NFPA standard, Statoil's (2013) practical application of emergency response is across three distinct \\"lines\\" that incorporate NFPA's elements. Line 1 is responsible for the operational management of an incident; line 2, typically housed off-site, is responsible for tactical guidance and additional resource management. Finally, in the case of major incidents, line 3 provides strategic guidance, group resource management, and government and media relations. While it is impossible to plan for every disaster, crisis or emergency, the Statoil investigation into the terrorist attacks on In Amenas place emphasis on the importance of having a disaster response. The report concludes that a disaster response framework may be utilized in an array of disaster situations, such as that at In Amenas.  Organizations  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); is responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies that require an international response. OCHA plays a key role in operational coordination in crisis situations. This includes assessing situations and needs; agreeing common priorities; developing common strategies to address issues such as negotiating access, mobilizing funding and other resources; clarifying consistent public messaging; and monitoring progress. The organisation in the United Kingdom for the provision of communications disaster response is RAYNET. The UK organisation for the provision of disaster response by off-road vehicles is 4x4 Response. In Canada, GlobalMedic was established in 1998 as a non-sectarian humanitarian-aid NGO to provide disaster relief services to large scale catastrophes around the world.Czekaj, Laura. \\"Ready for the World: Paramedics Train for International Disasters\\", Ottawa Sun, 5 November 2006. Time magazine recognized the work of GlobalMedic in its 2010 Time 100 issue. It has a roster of over 1,000 volunteers from across Canada that includes professional rescuers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics who donate their time to respond to international disasters. Their personnel are divided into Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) that operate rescue units, Water Purification Units (WPUs) designed to provide safe drinking water; and Emergency Medical Units (EMUs) that use inflatable field hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment. Since 2004, GlobalMedic teams have deployed to over 60 humanitarian disasters around the world. In India, the National Disaster Management Authority is responsible for planning for mitigating effects of natural disasters and anticipating and avoiding man-made disasters. It also coordinates the capacity-building and response of government agencies to crises and emergencies. The National Disaster Response Force is an inter- government disaster response agency that specializes in search, rescue and rehabilitation. In the US, the Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinates federal operational and logistical disaster response capability needed to save and sustain lives, minimize suffering, and protect property in a timely and effective manner in communities that become overwhelmed by disasters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer information for specific types of emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters and severe weather, as well as chemical and radiation accidents. Also, the Emergency Preparedness and Response Program of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations. Among volunteers, the American Red Cross is chartered by Congress in 1900 to lead and coordinate non-profit efforts.A Brief History of the American Red Cross, RedCross.org website. They are supported by disaster relief organizations from many religious denominations and community service agencies.Disaster Relief Agencies, RedCross.org website. Licensed amateur radio operators support most volunteer organizations, and are often affiliated with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). = Disaster response organizations = In addition to the response by the government, a great deal of assistance in the wake of any disaster comes from charities, disaster response and non-governmental organizations. The biggest international umbrella organizations are the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the International Council of Voluntary Agencies. Humanitarian OSM Team works to update and provide map in areas struck by disaster.  Disaster response technologies  Smart Emergency Response System (SERS)Smart Emergency Response System , team website. prototype was built in the SmartAmerica Challenge 2013-2014,SmartAmerica Challenge , website. a United States government initiative. SERS has been created by a team of nine organizations led by MathWorks. The project was featured at the White House in June 2014 and described by Todd Park (U.S. Chief Technology Officer) as an exemplary achievement. The SmartAmerica initiative challenges the participants to build cyber-physical systems as a glimpse of the future to save lives, create jobs, foster businesses, and improve the economy. SERS primarily saves lives. The system provides the survivors and the emergency personnel with information to locate and assist each other during a disaster. SERS allows to submit help requests to a MATLAB-based mission center connecting first responders, apps, search-and-rescue dogs, a 6-feet-tall humanoid, robots, drones, and autonomous aircraft and ground vehicles. The command and control center optimizes the available resources to serve every incoming requests and generates an action plan for the mission. The Wi-Fi network is created on the fly by the drones equipped with antennas. In addition, the autonomous rotorcrafts, planes, and ground vehicles are simulated with Simulink and visualized in a 3D environment (Google Earth) to unlock the ability to observe the operations on a mass scale.Video Smart Emergency Response System The International Charter Space and Major Disasters provides for the charitable retasking of satellite assets, providing coverage from 15 space agencies, etc. which is wide albeit contingent. It focuses on the beginning of the disaster cycle, when timely data is of the essence. Digital technologies are increasingly being used in humanitarian action, they have shown to improve the health and recovery of populations affected by both natural and man-made disasters. They are used in humanitarian response to facilitate and coordinate aid in various stages including preparedness, response, and recovery from emergencies. More specifically, mobile health (mHealth), which is defined as the use of communication devices such as mobile phones for the purpose of health services information. Nowadays, millions of people use mobile phones as a means of daily communication and data transference, out of which 64% live in developing countries. One of the most important characteristics of disasters are the harms caused to infrastructures, accessibility issues, and an exponential need of medical and emergency services. In such situations, the use of mobile phones for mHealth can be vital, especially when other communication infrastructures are hindered. In such conditions, the abundance of mobile technology in developing countries provide the opportunity to be harnessed for helping victims and vulnerable people. Mobile health information technology platforms, in the acute phase of disaster response, create a common operational framework that improves disaster response by standardizing data acquisition, organizing information storage, and facilitating communication among medical staff. One of the challenges in disaster response is the need of pertinent, effective and continuous analysis of the situation and information in order to evaluate needs and resources. mHealth has been shown to provide effective disaster preparedness with real time collection of medical data as well as helping identify and create needs assessments during disasters. Using mobile technology in heath has set the stage for the dynamic organization of medical resources and promotion of patient care done through quick triage, patient tracking, and documentation storage and maintenance. Managing an effective and influential response requires cooperation, which is also facilitated through mHealth. A retrospective study demonstrated that applying mHealth can lead to up to 15% decrease of unnecessary hospital transfers during disasters. In addition, they provide field hospital administrators with real-time census information essential for planning, resource allocation, inter-facility patient transfers, and inter-agency collaboration. mHealth technology systems can improve post-operative care and patient handoffs between volunteer providers. Data entry with mobile devices is now widely used to facilitate the registration of displaced individuals, to conduct surveys, identify those in need of assistance, and to capture data on issues such as food security, vaccination rates, and mortality. Above all, mHealth can harness the power of information to improve patient outcomes. Efforts lead by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and Operational Medicine Institute during the Haiti earthquake resulted in the creation of a web-based mHealth system that created a patient log of 617 unique entries used by on-the-ground medical providers and field hospital administrators. This helped facilitate provider triage, improve provider handoffs, and track vulnerable populations such as unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, traumatic orthopedic injuries and specified infectious diseases. Also, during the Haiti earthquake, the International Red Crescent sent more than 45 million SMSs to Viole mobile phone users. This resulted in 95% of the receiver reporting they had gained useful information, and out of these 90% reported the SMS helped in their preparedness. Collective communication and behaviour When a disaster occurs, prompt and reliable information exchange, coordinated behaviour and self-sacrifice play a role in individual and collective safety. A study published in 2020 showed that social networks can function poorly as pathways for inconvenient truths that people would rather ignore and that the interplay between communication and action may depend on the structure of social networks. It also showed that communication networks suppress necessary \\"evacuations\\" in test-scenarios because of spontaneous and diffuse emergence of false reassurance when compared to groups of isolated individuals and that larger networks with a smaller proportion of informed subjects suffered more damage due to human-caused misinformation. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

It covers an area of . The neighbourhood is served by Ambattur railway station of the Chennai Suburban Railway. Ambattur has its origins in a village of the same name which can be located at present as areas opposite to Ambattur telephone exchange. Ambattur was a village with large extents of agricultural farm lands irrigated by the once-sprawling Ambattur Lake. In 2011, the neighbourhood had a population 466,205. During the 2015 floods when most areas of Chennai was stranded in water, Ambattur was not much flooded like other neighbourhood of Chennai City. Etymology This place is one of 108 Shakthi Sthals in the country. The Amman temple (for the Hindu deity Durga) here is the fifty-first in the order, giving the locality the Tamil name \\"aimbaththu onraam oor\\" (‡Æê‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æí‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æä‡Æ∞‡Øç), meaning fifty-first place/temple village, which later transmuted as Ambattur. The goddess is worshiped in the form of Vaishnavi. Ambattur is also called so because it was a collaboration of 50 small towns (ambathu oor in Tamil), from which the name Ambattur was derived. History Sir Ivan Stedeford, chairman of Tube Investments, United Kingdom, was instrumental in starting the TI factory and TII complex in the country. Sir Ivan signed a joint venture agreement with A. M. Murugappa Chettiar of the Murugappa Group, which was then a small business house manufacturing sandpaper and abrasives for the war effort and also trading war surplus. It was the first joint venture agreement to be signed in South India after Independence. This resulted in the establishment of the TI Cycle factory in a mango grove in Ambattur by 1951, and manufacture of the 'Hercules India' bicycle soon began. By 1954, the word 'India' was dropped from the name when international quality standards were met. In 1954, Sir Ivan signed his second joint venture, Tube Products India, with the Murugappa family. The factory was established on what had been the British Government of Malaya's Immigration Camp. By 1956, production was started in the new factory and soon resulted in the establishment of other TI factories in the Ambattur- Avadi industrial stretch. This led to a rapid growth in population in the region and several public amenities were established in Ambattur by TI company, such as the Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar Higher Secondary School (named after the person who had initially introduced the partners to each other), a post office and a bank. When the growing population demanded a hospital, the company established one between Ambattur and Avadi in 1966 from a gift of around ¬£5,000 from Sir Ivan. The hospital was named the Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital in his honour. Administration Ambattur comes under the Sriperumbudur Parliamentary constituency. It was previously under the North Chennai parliamentary constituency, and, along with Villivakkam, it was the largest assembly constituency in India. The Fame organisation sangam originated here. The delimitation process of assembly constituencies had given Ambattur a new identity of its own: Constituency No. 8, Tamil Nadu. Once a major panchayat, Ambattur was made a township in the 1960s and a selection- grade municipality from April 1975. In May 1992, it was raised to special- grade municipality. It was a municipality till October 2011. It had been divided into 52 wards. Ambattur Municipality included Padi, Korattur, Mogappair, kallikuppam, Ayapakkam TNHB and the Ambattur Industrial Estate areas. On 15 June 2011, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister of India to expand the city limits of Chennai by which the Ambattur Municipality would come under the new scheme. Since 2011, it is part of Chennai Corporation as Zone 7 with 15 wards (Ward Nos. 79 to 91, 93). OneIndia. Demographics According to the 2011 census, Ambattur had a population of 466,205 with a sex-ratio of 985 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 48,444 were under the age of six, constituting 24,829 males and 23,615 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 11.49% and 0.33% of the population, respectively. The average literacy of the town was 82.61%, compared with the national average of 72.99%. The town had 120,248 households. There were 184,390 workers, comprising 1,252 cultivators, 1,128 main agricultural labourers, 2,467 in house hold industries, 159,242 other workers, 20,301 marginal workers, 507 marginal cultivators, 453 marginal agricultural labourers, 641 marginal workers in household industries and 18,700 other marginal workers. As per the religious census of 2011, Ambattur had 86.53% Hindus, 3.68% Muslims, 8.95% Christians, 0.05% Sikhs, 0.04% Buddhists, 0.17% Jains, 0.57% following other religions and 0.01% following no religion or did not indicate any religious preference. During 2001‚Äì2011, Ambattur registered a population growth of 54%. Waterbodies A section of the Ambattur Lake Ambattur has two main waterbodies, namely the Ambattur Eri and the Chithu Oragadam Lake and the bigger Puzhal eri on the outskirts. The upkeep of the Ambattur Eri is plagued by problems such as dumping of garbage,Chennai Online water mining and construction of buildings and the Chithu Oragadam (Thangal) Eri suffers due to pollution by sewage.The Hindu The local body generates nearly 250 tonnes of garbage daily.Garbage burning sets off problems for Ambattur Ambattur has a stormwater drain network of 177.95 km, the largest of the eight zones newly added to the Corporation of Chennai in 2011. Economy The economy of Ambattur is mainly industrial. It was well known as an auto ancillary hub. However, in the late 2000s many IT companies have come up in Ambattur. One Indiabulls Park, Ambattur =Ambattur Industrial Estate= The Ambattur Industrial Estate, spread over an area of 1,430 acres (4.9 km2), houses about 1,800 unitsArterial roads in Ambattur Estate to be widened soon and is the biggest small scale industrial estate in South Asia. It was commissioned in the year 1964 by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Companies like Britannia Industries, TI Cycles of India, Dunlop, and TVS have their plants in Ambattur. Tata Communications has its satellite earth station at the Ambattur‚ÄìRed Hills road, known as wireless among the locals. Jaya TV, Vijay TV, Asianet and Kairali relay signals from this facility. The Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF), which manufactures military tanks, is just 5 km from this place, adding to its importance. A railway concrete sleeper manufacturing company is located near the Ambattur railway station. Textile industries such as Ambattur Clothing Limited (ACL) and Bombay Fashions have their facilities here and employ thousands of women. The units in the Industrial Estate generate a combined annual revenue of over 35,000 million. The Industrial Estate has a bus terminus. The Ambattur Estate terminus and the maintenance centre with a capacity of 100 buses were opened in 1967. However, , the centre handles 125 buses a day, with a staff count of 1,100. IT parks The Ambit IT Park with CMA CGM, iOpex Technologies and CSS Corp Ambattur Industrial Estate has attracted a lot of IT companies due to its proximity to residential neighbourhoods and the lower rentals. The lease rentals of IT Parks in Ambattur are half of those in the city. Information Technology (IT) companies such as MilesTs, HCL Technologies, Dell and Tata Consultancy Services have their development centres here. Out of the 22 facilities that HCL Technologies has in Chennai, six are in Ambattur. There are also a few BPO centres such as Perot Systems, Telebuy, Polaris BPO, Serco, First Source & iOPEX Technologies. Prince Info Park, Kochar Technology Park, Ambit IT Park. Chennai Tech Park, a , state-of-the-art, futuristic IT park, on of land is commissioned since 2009 by IndiaLand Park. Now that 10 acres commercial building is bought by Indiabulls Securities Ltd for Rs 600 crores and renamed it as One IndiaBulls Park, current occupiers of the complex include Royal Bank of Scotland, Kone, Britannia Industries, Ajuba, Covenant, Telebuy, Ibox, Bean Balls, Germany's Modisch, Yes Bank and Etisalat. One IndiaBulls park is one of the major IT parks in Ambattur. As a remarkable mile stone, CMA CGM, world's 3rd largest liner started their documentation centre along with Regional eCommerce Team in AMBIT park. However, the demand for commercial space in Ambattur is not as robust as Rajiv Gandhi Salai which is marketed extensively by the government. While IT and ITeS firms in Ambattur have brought in a new image to the industrial belt that has been known for its garment and auto-ancillary units, it has increased the real estate prices. Transport =Road= The Chennai- Tiruvallur High Road (CTH Road or NH205) passes through Ambattur and the Chennai-Kolkata highway is just about 7 km from the place making it a strategic location. On an average, about 40,000 passenger car units use the CTH Road. The new Chennai Bypass road between Maduravoyal and Madhavaram passes through Ambattur Industrial Estate. It connects NH4 with NH5 and NH205 via Ambattur Industrial Estate. The Ambattur bus terminus is located adjacent to the MTH Road and has MTC (city buses) connecting Ambattur with various points in Chennai city. Ambattur does not have a proper bus terminus despite being one of the biggest localities of Chennai. A lot of buses from Avadi and the outskirts of Chennai also pass through Ambattur, offering good connectivity. There are also a few buses operating to Nagercoil, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Vellore and other parts of Tamil Nadu from here. Buses to the famous pilgrim centre of Tirupathi can also be availed from Ambattur. On 4 October 2013, the Tamil Nadu Highways department issued a GO extending the entire stretch of the road till Tirutani to 6 lanes at a cost of 1,680 million, by means of land acquisition from 12 villages. In the first phase, the road will be widened to 100 ft (4 lanes) with centre median at a cost of 980 million. =Rail= The Chennai Central-Arakkonam railway line passes through Ambattur and has two railway stations in the neighbourhood. Ambattur railway station serves the residential areas and Pattaravakkam railway station serves the Ambattur Industrial Estate, kallikuppam and Karruku neighbourhood areas. Suburban Broad Gauge EMU trains operate daily from Chennai Central and Chennai Beach to Avadi, Tiruvallur, Patabiram Military Siding, Arakkonam, Vellore, Tirupathi, and Tiruttani via Ambattur. By rail, Ambattur is 30 minutes from Chennai Central, 20 minutes from Perambur and 10 minutes from Villivakkam. Many fast EMU locals (suburban trains) towards Tiruvallur, Arakkonam and Tiruttani, stop at Ambattur railway station, But fast local trains towards Chennai central do not halt at Ambattur because non availability of platform in fast line. By fast local train it takes 25 minutes from Chennai Central. Ambattur having Passenger Reservation Centre Timing 8.00Hrs to14.00Hrs. There is a pending request to extension of Platform length to accommodate express trains, Increase timing of Passenger Reservation Centre, subway, and overbridge at Ambattur Educational institutions =Day Cares= *Maple kids play school & Daycare *Mummy's Child care & Playschool =Schools= * Sri Sathya Sai Nursery and Primary School (Shoba Nagar, Near Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital) * Velammal NEWGEN Park -CBSE IIT, Surapet * Velammal Vidhyashram - CBSE & IIT (Oragadam, Ambattur) *Annai Violet International School (CBSE) *Sri Mahaganesa Vidhyasala * Sri Venkateswara Matric.

The unit is similar to the units dBov and decibels relative to overload (dBO). The level of 0dBFS is assigned to the maximum possible digital level. For example, a signal that reaches 50% of the maximum level has a level of ‚àí6dBFS, which is 6dB below full scale. Conventions differ for root mean square (RMS) measurements, but all peak measurements smaller than the maximum are negative levels. A digital signal that does not contain any samples at 0dBFS can still clip when converted to analog form due to the signal reconstruction process interpolating between samples. This can be prevented by careful digital-to- analog converter circuit design. Measurements of the true inter-sample peak levels are notated as dBTP or dB TP (\\"decibels true peak\\").  RMS levels  Since a peak measurement is not useful for qualifying the noise performance of a system, or measuring the loudness of an audio recording, for instance, RMS measurements are often used instead. A potential for ambiguity exists when assigning a level on the dBFS scale to a waveform rather than to a specific amplitude, because some engineers follow the mathematical definition of RMS, which is ‚àí3dB below the peak value, while others choose the reference level so that RMS and peak measurements of a sine wave produce the same result. \\\\- Allows \\"0dB = FS Sine Wave\\" or \\"0dB = FS Square Wave\\" \\\\- \\"0 Db\\" reference can be either \\"FS Sine Wave\\" or \\"FS Square1 1Wave\\" The unit dB FS or dBFS is defined in AES Standard AES17-1998, IEC 61606, and ITU-T Recs. P.381 and P.382, such that the RMS value of a full-scale sine wave is designated 0dB FS. This means a full-scale square wave would have an RMS value of +3dB FS.Digital and Analog Measurement Units for Digital CMOS Microphone Preamplifier ASICs (Analog Devices) - \\"The definition of 0 dBFS as a full-scale sine wave is used by several audio analyzers, and the rms and peak values in the digital domain for a sine wave are equal for these analyzers. ‚Ä¶ Thus, a square wave whose top and bottom are at the maximum digital codes has an rms value of 1.414 FFS or 3.01 dBFS\\" This convention is used in Wolfson and Cirrus Logic digital microphone specs, etc. The unit dBov is defined in the ITU-T G.100.1 telephony standard such that the RMS value of a full-scale square wave is designated 0dBov. All possible dBov measurements are negative numbers, and a sine wave cannot exist at a larger RMS value than ‚àí3 dBov without clipping. This unit can be applied to both analog and digital systems. This convention is the basis for the ITU's LUFS loudness unit, and is also used in Sound Forge and Euphonix meters, and Analog Devices digital microphone specs (though referred to as \\"dBFS\\").  Dynamic range  The measured dynamic range of a digital system is the ratio of the full scale signal level to the RMS noise floor. The theoretical minimum noise floor is caused by quantization noise. This is usually modeled as a uniform random fluctuation between ‚àí LSB and + LSB. (Only certain signals produce uniform random fluctuations, so this model is typically, but not always, accurate.) As the dynamic range is measured relative to the RMS level of a full scale sine wave, the dynamic range and the level of this quantization noise in dBFS can both be estimated with the same formula (though with reversed sign): : \\\\mathrm{DR} = \\\\mathrm{SNR} = 20\\\\log_{10}{\\\\left(2^n \\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{3}{2}}\\\\right)} \\\\approx 6.0206 n + 1.761 The value of n equals the resolution of the system in bits or the resolution of the system minus 1bit (the measure error). For example, a 16-bit system has a theoretical minimum noise floor of ‚àí98.09dBFS relative to a full-scale sine wave: : \\\\mathrm{DR} = \\\\mathrm{SNR} = 20\\\\log_{10}{\\\\left(2^{16} \\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{3}{2}}\\\\right)} \\\\approx 6.0206 \\\\cdot 16 + 1.761 \\\\approx 98.09\\\\, In any real converter, dither is added to the signal before sampling. This removes the effects of non-uniform quantization error, but increases the minimum noise floor. History The phrase \\"dB below full scale\\" has appeared in print since the 1950s, and the term \\"dBFS\\" has been used since 1977. Although the decibel (dB) is permitted for use alongside units of the International System of Units (SI), the dBFS is not.Taylor 1995, Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI), NIST Special Publication SP811  Analog levels  dBFS is not defined for analog levels, according to standard AES-6id-2006. No single standard converts between digital and analog levels, mostly due to the differing capabilities of different equipment.

History  In early 2000, WCW decided that Kevin Sullivan's booking style was not as successful as they had hoped. So, they decided to bring back former WCW president Eric Bischoff and former head of creativity Vince Russo, putting them together to run WCW with the thought that they could keep each other's failures in check. On-screen, Bischoff and Russo took over and declared all WCW championships vacant on April 10, 2000. They also declared a new stable with both of them at the helm called The New Blood. It consisted of most of the younger, up-and-coming wrestlers in WCW along with longtime talent that had never been pushed for years. Their main enemies became known as the Millionaire's Club, the older veteran stars of the company whom they claimed held back the younger talent. The idea was to get the younger talent over and generate more interest among the younger fans that watched the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) instead of WCW, although it later evolved into an nWo rehash. Many argue that a primary reason the WWF defeated WCW in the Monday Night Wars is because they greatly put over new talent rather than relying so heavily on long-established veterans. As such, this was seen as an overly extreme and late attempt at that strategy. On April 16, 2000, at Spring Stampede in Chicago, Illinois, all of the titles were filled with matches between the New Blood and the Millionaire's Club. The feuds continued for another month or so before both factions disbanded due to WCW management deciding the angle was not working due to it backfiring, as the Millionaire's Club got most of the positive fan reaction. The true end of the angle occurred on July 9, after the infamous Vince Russo's worked shoot promo, which caused Hogan and Bischoff to leave the promotion.

He is known mainly for resigning from the Carter administration because of a scandal during his first year in office. However, he was later cleared of all charges. Early life Lance was born in Gainesville, Georgia. His father, Thomas Jackson Lance, had served as president of Young Harris College, in northeastern Georgia, and in 1941, the family relocated to Calhoun, Gordon County, when Lance's father became superintendent of Calhoun schools. After graduating from Calhoun High School in 1948, Lance attended Emory University for two years before he transferred to the University of Georgia. In 1950, he married LaBelle David, whose family owned the Calhoun First National Bank; they had four sons. Under pressure to support his wife and their first son, Lance dropped out of the University of Georgia, where he had been a member of Sigma Chi, before graduating. He became a teller at the bank and, within a decade ascended to its presidency after he had acquired a controlling stake with a consortium of investors in 1958. Meanwhile, he completed American Bankers Association-accredited executive education programs at Louisiana State University's School of Banking of the South (1952‚Äì1954) and the Stonier School of Banking at Rutgers University (1961‚Äì1963). He later served as president of the National Bank of Georgia in Atlanta from 1975 to 1977. Carter administration Lance became acquainted with Jimmy Carter during the latter's time as Governor of Georgia and served as State Highway Director during his administration. Lance ran to succeed Carter in 1974 but lost a bid for the Democratic nomination, finishing third in the first primary behind Lester Maddox and the eventual winner, George Busbee. During the campaign, Lance accrued campaign debts of nearly $600,000.Anchorage Daily News January 16, 1979 Lance (center) with National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and Defense Secretary Harold Brown Lance was an adviser to Carter during his successful 1976 presidential campaign. After Carter's victory over President Gerald Ford, Lance was named Director of the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB). According to former OMB officials, it was well known in the department that Bert Lance and President Carter prayed together every morning. Within six months, questions were raised by the press and Congress about mismanagement and corruption when Lance was chairman of the board of Calhoun First National Bank of Georgia. William Safire's article written during this time, Carter's Broken Lance, earned a Pulitzer Prize in 1978. It was an embarrassment for Carter's administration, particularly as it took place soon after President Nixon's Watergate scandal and President Ford's pardon of Nixon just before he could be tried for any crimes. To ensure there was no hint of similar impropriety in the Carter administration, Lance resigned his position. Later, after a well-publicized trial in 1980, a jury acquitted Lance on nine charges, and did not decide two others. In 1981, Lance returned to the Calhoun First National Bank as chairman; he left in 1986. He then made something of a political comeback in 1982 when he was elected Chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party. In 1984, Walter Mondale ‚Äì who was the Democratic candidate for U.S. President at the time ‚Äì sought to name Lance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but was forced to withdraw his name after opposition from Democratic party members. Lance's appointment as general manager of the 1984 campaign lasted only a few weeks. Lance was an advisor to Jesse Jackson during Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign.  \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\"  Lance is credited with popularizing the phrase \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\", which he was quoted as saying in the May 1977 issue of the magazine Nation's Business. The expression became widespread, and William Safire wrote that it \\"has become a source of inspiration to anti-activists.\\" BCCI scandal Lance was implicated in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was involved in deals with notable BCCI luminaries Agha Hasan Abedi, Mochtar Riady, and Ghaith Pharaon and with BCCI's largest borrower, Ponnapula Sanjeeva Prasad, Docket Numbers 90-1825,90-1844, Reporting Judge 60 USLW 2358 and joined with Arkansas-based power investor Jackson Stephens in facilitating BCCI's takeover of Financial General Bankshares. Lance and Stephens made millions in the wake of BCCI's collapse. During Carter's run for office, Lance had helped him secure funding by using stored peanuts at Carter's peanut business. It was alleged that there were no peanuts in the storage facilities. In January 1978, Lance sold his stock in National Bank of Georgia to Pharaon, and on the same day, BCCI founder Abedi paid off Lance's $3.5 million loan at the First National Bank of Chicago. Meanwhile, the Chicago bank was making huge loans to the Soviet Union with open lines of credit. The next month, Lance helped BCCI's hostile bid for Financial General Bankshares of Washington. The attempt failed, but three years later, BCCI secretly acquired the bank and renamed it First American Bankshares by using 15 Arab investors as nominees. The next year, Lance introduced Carter to Abedi. In 1987, First American Bankshares acquired National Bank of Georgia from Pharaon. BCCI was terminated in 1991, and it was subsequently revealed that the bank had engaged in many illegal activities, including secretly controlling several US banks, in violation of federal banking statutes. In popular culture On Saturday Night Live, September 24, 1977, the day Lance resigned from the Carter administration, John Belushi (playing Lance) and Dan Aykroyd (playing Carter) appeared in an advertising parody of an American Express credit card commercial. In a Season 5 episode of Good Times (1977), JJ references Bert Lance while offering to make out a check for the family budget, knowing they have no money. In \\"Making Out\\", a 1979 episode of the sitcom What's Happening!, Rerun (played by Fred Berry) confuses Bert Lance with Cyrus Vance while trying to impress a date who is a political science major. A stretch of Interstate 75 in Georgia has been named for Lance. Death Lance died on August 15, 2013, at his home in northwest Georgia at age 82. He had been in hospice care due to recent declining health, caused by aging. Works * References Further reading *Biography Index. A cumulative index to biographical material in books and magazines.

It was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp for Confederate officers captured during the American Civil War. Initially, Johnson's Island was the only Union prison exclusively for Confederate officers but eventually held privates, political prisoners, persons sentenced to court martial and spies. Civilians who were arrested as guerrillas, or bushwhackers, were also imprisoned on the island.Johnson's Island Confederate Civil War Prison Cemetery During its three years of operation, more than 15,000 men were incarcerated there. The island is named after L. B. Johnson, the owner of the island beginning about 1852. It was originally named 'Bull's Island' by its first owner, Epaphras W. Bull, around 1809 (later misspelled \\"Epaproditus\\" Bull, by local-historians.History of Ottawa County (Ohio) 175 years; Patty O'Keeffe, 2016). 200px Civil War years In late 1861, Federal officials selected Johnson's Island as the site for a prisoner of war camp to hold up to 2,500 captured Confederate officers. The island offered easy access by ship for supplies to construct and maintain a prison and its population. Sandusky Bay offered more protection from the elements than on other nearby islands, which were also closer to Canada in the event of a prison break. Woods of hickory and oak trees could provide lumber and fuel. The U.S. government leased half the island from private owner Leonard B. Johnson for $500 a year, and for the duration of the war carefully controlled access to the island. The prison opened in April 1862. A wooden stockade surrounded 12 two-story prisoner housing barracks, a hospital, latrines, sutler‚Äôs stand, three wells, a pest house, and two large mess halls (added in August 1864). More than 40 buildings stood outside the prison walls, including barns, stables, a limekiln, forts, barracks for officers, and a powder magazine. They were used by the 128th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, which guarded the prison. The prisoners had a lively community, with amateur theatrical performances, publishing, and crafts projects available. After the unraveling of a Confederate espionage ring which had been plotting the seizure of the Great Lakes warship USS Michigan and a mass breakout of prisoners, Forts Johnson and Hill were constructed over the winter of 1864‚Äì65. They were not operational until March 1865, in the war's final months, when the prisoner population peaked at 3,200. More than 15,000 men passed through Johnson's Island until it was closed in September 1865. About 200 prisoners died as a result of the harsh Ohio winters, food and fuel shortages, and disease. Johnson's Island had one of the lowest mortality rates of any Civil War prison. Confederates made many escape attempts, including efforts by some to walk across the frozen Lake Erie to freedom in Canada, but only a handful of escapes were successful. Among the prominent Confederate generals imprisoned on Johnson's Island were Isaac R. Trimble and James J. Archer (both captured at the Battle of Gettysburg), William Beall, Thomas Benton Smith, Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson and Missouri cavalrymen M. Jeff Thompson and John S. Marmaduke, William Lewis Cabell later Mayor of Dallas and Lieutenant Christopher Columbus Nash, later the sheriff of Grant Parish, Louisiana, who directed the Colfax riot in 1873, was also imprisoned at Johnson's Island. Postbellum After the war, the prison camp was abandoned. Most of the buildings were auctioned off by the Army, and some were razed after falling into disrepair. The last antebellum house burned down by accident in 1901.Sandusky Daily Star (newsp.) July 14, 1901 About 1894, a summer resort was established at the eastern end of the island, but its pavilion burned in 1897 and, although the pavilion was later rebuilt, the resort failed. The land was used for farming and rock quarrying. Many lakeside homes have since been built, and the island is now quite developed with two subdivisions. As a result of this development, most of the Civil War-related sites have been razed. On June 8, 1910 Moses Ezekiel's statue Southern (or the Lookout), a monument to the Confederate prisoners held on the island, was unveiled.https://siris- artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=150U523774DY2.2784&profile;=ariall&source;=~!siartinventories&view;=subscriptionsummary&uri;=full=3100001~!375887~!56&ri;=3&aspect;=Browse&menu;=search&ipp;=20&spp;=20&staffonly;=&term;=Ezekiel,+Moses+Jacob,+Sir,+1844-1917,+sculptor.&index;=AUTHOR&uindex;=&aspect;=Browse&menu;=search&ri;=3 In 1990 Johnson's Island was designated a National Historic Landmark. A causeway was built to connect it with the mainland. The Confederate cemetery, as well as Fort Hill in the interior of the island, are accessible to the public.

Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2003. Even in modern times the professional core of the United States Army continues to be called the Regular Army. From the time of the American Revolution until after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, state militias and volunteer regiments organized by the states (but thereafter controlled by federal authorities and federal generals in time of war) supported the smaller Regular Army of the United States. These volunteer regiments came to be called United States Volunteers (USV) in contrast to the Regular United States Army (USA). During the American Civil War, about 97 percent of the Union Army was United States Volunteers. In contemporary use, the term Regular Army refers to the full-time active component of the United States Army, as distinguished from the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. A fourth component, the Army of the United States, has been inactive since the suspension of the draft in 1973 and the U.S. armed forces became an all-volunteer armed force.Bailey, Beth, \\"America's Army: Making the All-Volunteer Force\\", Belknap Press; (November 23, 2009) The American military system developed from a combination of the professional, national Continental Army, the state militias and volunteer regiments of the American Revolutionary War, and the similar post-Revolutionary War American military units under the Militia Act of 1792. These provided a basis for the United States Army's organization, with only minor changes, until the creation of the modern National Guard in 1903.Wright, Jr., Robert K. and Morris J. MacGregor, Jr. Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution, Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 1987, First Printing-CMH Pub 71-25. Retrieved September 28, 2010. The Militia Act provided for the use of volunteers who could be used anywhere in time of war, in addition to the State militias who were restricted to local use within their States for short periods of time. Even today's professional United States Army, which is augmented by the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, has a similar system of organization: a permanent, professional core, and additional units which can be mobilized in emergencies or times of war. Continental Army The United States Army traces its origin to the founding of the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, when the Continental Congress authorized a one-year enlistment of riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia to join the New England militia army besieging Boston.Hogan, Jr., David W., U. S. Army Center of Military History, Centuries of Service, The U.S. Army, 1775‚Äì2004, pamphlet, Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 2004, CMH Pub 70‚Äì71‚Äì1, p. 4. http://www.history.army.mil/books/cos/3-9.htm, retrieved September 28, 2010; http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/branches.html, retrieved September 28, 2010; Late in 1776, Congress called for the Continental Army to serve for the duration of the war. The army was to consist of 88 battalions raised and equipped by the states, with officers appointed by the states. Appointment of officers actually continued to be a collaboration between Congress, the Commander in Chief, George Washington, and the states. The number of battalions was to be apportioned to the states according to their populations.Mahon, John K. and Romana Danysh INFANTRY Part I: Regular Army, p. 6. Office of the Chief of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 1972, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 74-610219. Retrieved September 28, 2010. While the initial number of battalions approached the authorized strength, by 1 January 1787 the Continental infantry was only able to maintain enough regiments for fifty battalions.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 7 During the Revolutionary War, battalions and regiments were essentially the same. By October 19, 1781 when the British army under General Cornwallis surrendered to the American and French forces at Yorktown, the Continental Army had grown to sixty battalions.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 11. For varying short periods of time during the war, many state militia units and separate volunteer state regiments (usually organized only for local service) supported the Continental Army. Although training and equipping part-time or short-term soldiers and coordinating them with professionally trained regulars was especially difficult, this approach also enabled the Americans to prevail without having had to establish a large or permanent army.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, pp. 10‚Äì11. Because of the inability of Congress to raise much revenue under the Articles of Confederation, American suspicion of standing armies and perceived safety from foreign enemies provided by large oceans effectively controlled by the then non-threatening British Navy, Congress disbanded the Continental Army after the Treaty of Paris, the peace treaty with Great Britain, became effective. Congress retained 80 caretaker soldiers to protect arms and equipment at West Point, New York and Fort Pitt and called on the States to furnish 700 men from their militias for one year of service on the frontier.Hogan, Jr., 2004, p. 6; Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 11. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 recognized the need for a more permanent military establishment and provided for a national regular army and navy and a militia under state control, subject to civilian control through congressional control of appropriations and presidential leadership as commander in chief of the regular forces and of the militia when called into federal service.Hogan, Jr., 2004, pp. 6‚Äì7 On June 3, 1784, the day after the Continental Army was reduced to 80 men, the Congress established a regiment which was to be raised and officered by obtaining volunteers from the militia of four of the states.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 12 This unit, the First American Regiment was commanded until 1 January 1792 by Josiah Harmar of Pennsylvania, gradually turned into a Regular regiment known as the 1st Infantry in 1791, and in 1815 was it redesignated as the 3d Infantry in the reorganization of the army following the War of 1812. Congress gradually increased the military establishment from 700 men in 1784 to 5,104 in 1793. Legion of the United States The United States military realised it needed a well-trained standing army following St. Clair's Defeat on November 4, 1791, when a force led by General Arthur St. Clair was almost entirely wiped out by the Western Confederacy near Fort Recovery, Ohio.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 13. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox, Secretary of War, would lead to the creation of the Legion of the United States. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of Henry Bouquet, a professional Swiss soldier who served as a colonel in the British Army, and French Marshal Maurice de Saxe. In 1792 Anthony Wayne, a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of Major General. The Legion, which was recruited and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was formed around elements of the 1st and 2nd Regiments from the disbanded Continental Army. These units then became the First and Second Sub-Legions. The Third and Fourth Sub-Legions were raised from additional recruits. From June 1792 to November 1792, the Legion remained cantoned at Fort LaFayette in Pittsburgh. The new command was trained at Legionville, near present-day Baden, Pennsylvania. The base was the first formal basic training facility for the United States military. Throughout the winter of 1792-93, existing troops along with new recruits were drilled in military skills, tactics and discipline. The Legion then went on to fight the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between American Indian tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy in the area south of the Ohio River. The overwhelmingly successful campaign was concluded with the decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. The training the Legion received at Legionville was seen as instrumental to this victory. However, after Wayne's death, Brigadier General James Wilkinson, who was once Wayne's second-in-command of the Legion, began disbanding his former superior's organization in December 1796. His policy was to re-establish a military model based on a regimental system. Wilkinson, who was later found to be a paid agent for the Spanish Crown, tried to rid the US Army of everything Wayne had created. This resulted in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Sub-Legions becoming the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Regiments of the United States Army. Nevertheless, the new regiments honored their foundations: * Part of the shield in the coat-of- arms of the 1st US Infantry Regiment is red in honor of the 2nd Sub-Legion. * The Distinctive Unit Insignia worn on the uniform epaulette and beret by the 3rd US Infantry (The Old Guard) show a golden cocked hat with plume. This insignia represents the crest of the Old Guard's coat of arms which shows a black cocked hat with white, which were the colors of the 1st Sub-Legion. * The coat-of-arms of the 4th US Infantry Regiment is green and white in honor of the 4th Sub-Legion. In 1808, Congress agreed to the expansion of the Regular Army. This led to the establishment of the 5th, 6th and 7th Regular infantry regiments, and a Regiment of Riflemen. The decision was undertaken partly due to British aggression on the high seas. But it was also motivated by fears that the British were offering military support to the American Indians who were offering armed resistance to the expansion along the Northwest American frontier.Jasper M. Trautsch, \\"The Causes of the War of 1812: 200 Years of Debate,\\" Journal of Military History (Jan 2013) 77#1 pp 273‚Äì293. There was also a powerful motivation for the American government to uphold national honor in the face of what they considered to be British insults (such as the Chesapeake affair in 1807).Norman K. Risjord, \\"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor.\\" William And Mary Quarterly 1961 18(2): 196‚Äì210. in JSTOR War of 1812 In January 1812, with the threat of war with Britain looming larger, Congress authorized the army to add ten more regiments of infantry, which were to be larger than the existing regiments and authorized the President to call 50,000 militiamen into service, but in June 1812 Congress authorized a total of 25 infantry regiments of equal strength for the Regular Army.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, pp. 13‚Äì14. All the while the States competed with the Federal government for soldiers with shorter terms of enlistment for their regiments. Congress then directed the creation, in January 1813, of twenty new infantry regiments enlisted for just one year. Nineteen of them were raised.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 14. Early in 1814 four more infantry regiments and three more regiments of riflemen were constituted. These 48 regiments of infantry and 4 rifle regiments were the greatest number of infantry units included in the Regular Army until the First World War. Despite this increase in Regular Army units, nine out of ten infantrymen in the War of 1812 were militiamen.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 24. At the end of the war, by an act of March 1815, Congress set the peace establishment of the Regular Army at 10,000 men, divided among 8 infantry regiments, 1 rifle regiment; and a corps of artillery, but no cavalry regiments.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 16. In effect, most of the new regiments raised for the War of 1812 were treated as if they were volunteer regiments raised for the duration of the war and disbanded at its end. Seminole Wars In 1821 Congress felt safe enough to cut expenses by disbanding the Rifle Regiment and the 8th Infantry and reducing the size of companies to fifty-one enlisted men, the smallest ever.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 17. This arrangement endured for fifteen years when the Indians forced an enlargement. A mostly militia force won the Black Hawk War of 1831‚Äì1832. However, the Regular Army needed to be increased by 39 men per company plus one infantry regiment and volunteer and militia units had to be used, at least at first, in order to win the Seminole Wars in Florida, which began in December 1835 and lasted until 1842. After the war, the companies were reduced to minimum size but the second regiment of dragoons which had been added to the army was turned into a regiment of riflemen. When they were reconverted to dragoons after a year, the rifle corps disappeared.Mahon and Danysh, 1972, p. 18. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War At the start of the Mexican War, Congress tried to get along with just eight infantry regiments of Regulars, but gave the President power to expand their companies to one hundred enlisted men during the war. After hostilities commenced, Congress had to add nine new regiments with the same organization as the old ones to the Regular infantry. The cavalry of the U.S. Regular Army consisted of two light regiments trained to fight mounted or dismounted and designated as dragoons.Carney, Stephen A., The Occupation of Mexico, May 1846 - July 1848, p. 9, CMH PUB 73-3, U.S. Army Center of Military History, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., Last updated 23 May 2006. . Retrieved September 28, 2010. Although raised as Regulars, the nine new infantry regiments created during the Mexican War were disbanded when the war was over. By contrast to the army of mainly militiamen who fought the War of 1812, in the Mexican War, one of every ten soldiers was a militiaman, three were Regulars and six were war volunteers. During the Mexican War, some 73,260 volunteers enlisted, although fewer than 30,000 actually served in Mexico.Carney, 2006, p. 11. Congress added two new regiments to the Regular Army in 1855 because of the need to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico. American Civil War During the American Civil War, the Union Army consisted of a very small contingent of pre-war U.S. Army or \\"Regular Army\\" personnel combined with vast numbers of soldiers in state volunteer regiments raised and equipped by the States before being \\"federalized\\" and led by general officers appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. In many ways, these regiments resembled and might be analogized to the modern day National Guard. Due to their pre-war experience, they were considered by many to be the elite of the Union Army, and during battles regular army units were often held in reserve in case of emergencies. Officers during the Civil War from the state forces were known by the rank suffix \\"of volunteers\\"; if Regular Army, these officers were known by the rank suffix \\"USA\\". Thus, a state regiment colonel would be known as \\"colonel of volunteers\\" while a Regular Army captain would be known as \\"Captain, USA\\". Regular Army officers of the Civil War could accept commissions in volunteer forces and could also be granted brevet ranks (higher ranks than the permanent commission). In some cases, officers held as many as four ranks: a permanent rank (called \\"full rank\\") in the Regular Army, a full rank in the volunteers, and brevet ranks in both as a result of battlefield promotion, meritorious service or Congressional action. The officers typically would only refer to themselves by the highest rank they held. An example is Union Army officer James Henry Carleton who was a \\"full\\" captain, a brevet major in the regular army, a colonel of volunteers, and a brevet brigadier general. After the Civil War ended in 1865, the term Regular Army was used to denote an officer's permanent rank only when a brevet commission had also been received. Such was the case with George Custer who was a brevet major general of volunteers and a brevet Regular Army brigadier general while holding the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army. If no brevet rank was held, the officer was simply referred to by his permanent rank and the suffix \\"USA\\". Enlisted personnel could not hold brevet ranks and were all considered simply as United States Army personnel. The Confederate Army had its own approximate of the Regular Army, this known as the \\"Army of the Confederate States of America\\" or the \\"ACSA\\". The ACSA was considered the professional military while, as in the Union Army, the Confederacy mustered massive numbers of state volunteers into the \\"Provisional Army of the Confederate States\\" or the \\"PACS\\". Nearly all Confederate enlisted personnel were PACS while most senior general officers held dual commissions in the ACSA and PACS. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, for instance, was a lieutenant general in the PACS while holding the permanent rank of major of artillery in the ACSA. The ACSA concept was also used to ensure that none of the senior Confederate officers could ever be outranked by militia officers, considered subordinate to the PACS. World War I During World War I, with the founding of the National Army, the term Regular Army was used to describe a person's peacetime rank in contrast to the commissions offered to fight in the First World War. The Regular Army, as an actual U.S. Army component, was reorganized by the National Defense Act of 1920 (amending the National Defense Act of 1916), when the large draft force of the National Army was demobilized and disbanded. The remaining Army force was formed into the peacetime Regular Army (which included inactive units in the Regular Army Inactive [RAI]), augmented by the Organized Reserve (created by combining the Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) and the Enlisted Reserve Corps (ERC) authorized by the 1916 act), predecessor to the United States Army Reserve. Interwar years During the 1920s and 1930s, the Regular Army was badly underfunded and ranked 16th in the world. Promotions within the Regular Army were also very slow. Commissioned officers could easily spend 10 to 15 years in the junior grades. Enlisted personnel would often never rise above the rank of private. Dwight Eisenhower, for instance, spent sixteen years as a major before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1936. World War II During World War II, the Regular Army served as a corps of professionals who helped formed the initial leadership of the Army of the United States. Regular Army officers would sometimes hold two ranks: a permanent rank in the Regular Army and a temporary rank in the Army of the United States. Promotions within the Army of the United States were also very rapid and some officers were known to hold the permanent Regular Army rank of captain while serving as a colonel in the Army of the United States. The Army of the United States rank could also be revoked (sometimes known as \\"loss of theater rank\\") meaning that an officer would revert to Regular Army rank and, in effect, be demoted. Enlisted personnel did not hold dual ranks; rather, they were soldiers either in the Regular Army or the Army of the United States. To be a Regular Army soldier was also seen as a point of honor because they had voluntarily enlisted rather than being drafted. Enlisted Regular Army personnel were known by the \\"RA\\" abbreviation before their service numbers in contrast to the \\"AUS\\" of the Army of the United States. Post-war years After the demobilization of the Army of the United States in 1946, the United States Army was divided into the Regular Army (RA) and the Army Reserve (USAR). During the Korean War, the Army of the United States was reinstated but had only enlisted draftees. Officers after this point held Regular Army rank only, but could hold an additional \\"temporary\\" rank in addition to their permanent rank. Temporary Regular Army ranks were not as easily revoked as the former AUS ranks. Since the Vietnam War, officers' permanent rank is their RA rank. Active duty officers can hold an RA commission and rank and may also hold a higher rank with a USAR commission. Reserve officers hold only a USAR commission, but may serve in either the reserve component or on active duty. That is, all non-permanent ranks (including theater rank, temporary rank, battlefield promotions, etc.) are handled through USAR commissions. Those officers without RA commissions do not have a permanent rank. Enlisted ranks are all permanent RA ranks. After Vietnam, most Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and Officer Candidate School (OCS) graduates, and those receiving direct commissions were commissioned as RA, US Army Reserve (USAR), or into the Army National Guard of the United States (ARNG). USAR officers could be assessed into the basic USAR component; that is, officers who served one weekend a month and two weeks a year for training, or as an Other Than Regular Army (OTRA) officer. RA and OTRA officers were those who came on active duty and were expected to serve their full commission service obligation or until retirement. At promotion to major, OTRA officers had the option of requesting integration into the RA or remaining OTRA. If not selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel, OTRA majors were required to retire at 20 years unless the Secretary of the Army authorized further service as part of the Voluntary Indefinite (VOLINDEF) program. In the late 1990s, as part of a series of officer management regulatory changes, upon promotion to major all OTRA officers were required to integrate into the RA or exit service within 90 days. Recently, OTRA is rarely used with virtually all new officers being commissioned RA, USAR, or into the National Guard as appropriate. After the abolition of the draft, the Regular Army became the primary component of the United States Army, augmented by the Army Reserve and Army National Guard of the United States. In the early 1980s, the use of temporary Regular Army ranks was suspended. Since passage of the 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), all active duty officers are commissioned in the regular army. Eligible commissioned officers serving on active duty were automatically converted to RA on/or after Veteran's Day, 11 November 2005.US Army Human Resources Command. Hrc.army.mil (2012-01-25).

Its offices are on Lexington Street in Soho. The magazine was edited for fourteen years by veteran journalist Auberon Waugh. The current editor is Nancy Sladek. The magazine reviews a wide range of published books, including fiction, history, politics, biography and travel, and additionally prints new fiction. It is also known for the annual Bad Sex in Fiction Award it has run since 1993. Bad Sex in Fiction Award Each year since 1993, Literary Review has presented the annual Bad Sex in Fiction Award to the author it deems to have produced the worst description of a sex scene in a novel. The award is symbolically presented in the form of what has been described as a \\"semi- abstract trophy representing sex in the 1950s\\", depicting a naked woman draped over an open book. The award was established by Rhoda Koenig, a literary critic, and Auberon Waugh, then the magazine's editor. The aim of the award is \\"to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it\\". The enduring relevance of this rationale has been questioned, based on concerns about censorious public shaming (including online) of authors of serious literary fiction. =Winners= * 1993: Melvyn Bragg, A Time to Dance * 1994: Philip Hook, The Stonebreakers * 1995: Philip Kerr, Gridiron * 1996: David Huggins, The Big Kiss: An Arcade Mystery * 1997: Nicholas Royle, The Matter of the Heart * 1998: Sebastian Faulks, Charlotte Gray * 1999: A.

Ripe berries and cooked leaves of edible strains are used as food in some locales, and plant parts are used as a traditional medicine. A tendency exists in literature to incorrectly refer to many of the other \\"black nightshade\\" species as \\"Solanum nigrum\\". Solanum nigrum has been recorded from deposits of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic era of ancient Britain and it is suggested by the botanist and ecologist Edward Salisbury that it was part of the native flora there before Neolithic agriculture emerged. The species was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the first century AD and by the great herbalists, including Dioscorides. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus described six varieties of Solanum nigrum in Species Plantarum. Description Black nightshade flowers Black nightshade is a common herb or short-lived perennial shrub, found in many wooded areas, as well as disturbed habitats. It reaches a height of , leaves long and wide; ovate to heart-shaped, with wavy or large- toothed edges; both surfaces hairy or hairless; petiole long with a winged upper portion. The flowers have petals greenish to whitish, recurved when aged and surround prominent bright yellow anthers. The berry is mostly in diam., dull black or purple-black. In India, another strain is found with berries that turn red when ripe. Sometimes S. nigrum is confused for the more toxic deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), which is in a different genus within Solanaceae. A comparison of the fruit shows that the black nightshade berries grow in bunches, whereas the deadly nightshade berries grow individually. Another distinction is black nightshade flowers have white petals. =Growth habit= The suited soil pH value of black nightshade is between 5.5 and 6.5. It is rich in organic matter, water and fertility on the strong soil growth, in the lack of organic matter, poor ventilation clay, its roots will be stunted, plant growth is weak, commodity is poor. It is difficult to grow under the condition of high temperature and high humidity, the plant grows slowly, the tender shoot is easy to aging fiber, and the commodity is poor. Taxonomy Solanum nigrum is a highly variable species with many varieties and forms described.Solanum nigrum Factsheet, South Australian Government The recognized subspecies are: 1. S. nigrum L. subsp. nigrum ‚Äî glabrous to slightly hairy with appressed non-glandular hairs 2. S. nigrum L. subsp. schultesii (Opiz) Wessley ‚Äî densely hairy with patent, glandular hairs The Solanum nigrum complex ‚Äî also known as Solanum L. section Solanum ‚Äî is the group of black nightshade species characterized by their lack of prickles and stellate hairs, their white flowers, and their green or black fruits arranged in an umbelliform fashion. The Solanum species in this group can be taxonomically confused, more so by intermediate forms and hybridization between the species. Some of the major species within the S. nigrum complex are: S. nigrum, S. americanum, S. douglasii, S. opacum, S. ptychanthum, S.retroflexum, S. sarrachoides, S. scabrum, and S. villosum. Toxicity Leaves, flowers and fruit of S. nigrum Solanine levels in S. nigrum can be toxic. Children have died from poisoning after eating unripe berries. However, the plant is rarely fatal, with ripe berries causing symptoms of mild abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea. Poisoning symptoms are typically delayed for 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms of toxicity include fever, sweating, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, and drowsiness. Death from ingesting large amounts of the plant results from cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure. Livestock have also been poisoned from nitrate toxicity by grazing the leaves of S. nigrum. All kinds of animals can be poisoned after ingesting nightshade, including cattle, sheep, poultry, and swine. However, in central Spain, the great bustard (Otis tarda) may act as a seed disperser of European black nightshade (Solanum nigrum). Black nightshade is highly variable, and poisonous plant experts advise to avoid eating the berries unless they are a known edible strain. The toxin levels may also be affected by the plant's growing conditions. The toxins in S. nigrum are most concentrated in the unripe green berries, and immature fruit should be treated as toxic. Most cases of suspected poisoning are due to consumption of leaves or unripe fruit. There are ethnobotanical accounts of S. nigrum leaves and shoots being boiled as a vegetable with the cooking water being discarded and replaced several times to remove toxins. Uses Ripe berries of the \\"Red Makoi\\" variety of S. nigrum are edible Some of the uses ascribed to S. nigrum in literature may actually apply to other black nightshade species within the same species complex, and proper species identification is essential for food and medicinal uses (See Taxonomy section). =Culinary usage= S. nigrum has been widely used as a food since early times, and the fruit was recorded as a famine food in 15th-century China. Despite toxicity issues with some forms, the ripe berries and boiled leaves of edible strains are eaten. The thoroughly boiled leaves ‚Äî although strong and slightly bitter flavoureds ‚Äî are used like spinach as horta and in fataya pies and quiches. The ripe black berries are described as sweet and salty, with hints of liquorice and melon. In Kenya, among the Abagusii, S. nigrum (rinagu- singular; amanagu- plural) is a vegetable delicacy which when blanched and sauteed or boiled to soften and then salted or sauteed and eaten with Ugali (a corn meal product). In the rest of Kenya, S. nigrum (managu) is eaten in a similar way. In Tanzania, S. nigrum (mnafu or mnamvu in Kiswahili) is a popular green vegetable. Saut√©ed with chicken or pork, eaten with Ugali, it is both delicious and expensive meal in most restaurants in urban areas. Traditionally, the Iraqw people in northern Tanzania have used S. nigrum (manakw) as vegetable for generations, eaten with special ‚Äòugali‚Äô (xwante), stiff porridge made with corn, millet or sorghum flour. In India, the berries are casually grown and eaten, but not cultivated for commercial use. In South India, the leaves and berries are routinely consumed as food after cooking with tamarind, onion, and cumin seeds. The berries are referred to as \\"fragrant tomato\\". Although not very popular across much of its growing region, the fruit and dish are common in Tamil Nadu (‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Æø in Tamil), Kerala, southern Andhra Pradesh, and southern Karnataka. In Ethiopia, the ripe berries are picked and eaten by children in normal times, while during famines, all affected people would eat berries. In addition, the leaves are collected by women and children, who cook the leaves in salty water and consume them like any other vegetable. Farmers in the Konso Special Woreda report that because S. nigrum matures before the maize is ready for harvesting, it is used as a food source until their crops are ready. The Welayta people in the nearby Wolayita Zone do not weed out S. nigrum that appears in their gardens since they likewise cook and eat the leaves. In Ghana, they are called kwaansusuaa, and are used in preparing various soups and stews, including the popular palm nut soup commonly eaten with banku or fufu'. Ripe and unripe S nigrum berries on the same stalk In South Africa, the very ripe and hand-selected fruit (nastergal in Afrikaans and umsobo in Zulu) is cooked into a beautiful but quite runny purple jam. In Greece and Turkey, the leaves are called istifno, and in Crete known as stifno. They are one of the ingredients included in the salad of boiled greens known as horta. In Indonesia, the young fruits and leaves of cultivated forms are used and are known as ranti (Javanese) or leunca (Sundanese). The fruit and leaves are eaten raw as part of a traditional salad lalapan, or the fruit is cooked (fried) with oncom. It was imported into Australia from Mauritius in the 1850s as a vegetable during the gold rush, but S. nigrum is now prohibited for trade as a food by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. During ancient times in Hawaii young shoots, leaves, small white flowers, and small black berries were eaten. The leaves, among other greens, were cooked by rolling hot stones among them in a covered gourd.Thrum, Manoa Valley, Hawaiian Annual 1892 =Medicinal usage= The plant has a long history of medicinal usage, dating back to ancient Greece. \\"... In the fourteenth century, we hear of the plant under the name of Petty Morel being used for canker and with Horehound and wine taken for dropsy.\\" It was a traditional European medicine used as a strong sudorific, analgesic and sedative with powerful narcotic properties, but was considered a \\"somewhat dangerous remedy\\". Internal use has fallen out of favor in Western herbalism due to its variable chemistry and toxicity, but it is used topically as a treatment for herpes zoster. There is much disagreement as to whether the leaves and fruit of S. nigrum are poisonous. But many countries grow this plant as a food crop. The toxicity of S. nigrum may vary by the region and species where it grows. S. nigrum is an important ingredient in traditional Indian medicines. Infusions are used in dysentery, stomach complaints, and fever. The juice of the plant is used on ulcers and other skin diseases. The fruits are used as a tonic, laxative, appetite stimulant, and for treating asthma and \\"excessive thirst\\". Traditionally the plant was used to treat tuberculosis. It is known as peddakasha pandla koora in the Telangana region. This plant's leaves are used to treat mouth ulcers that happen during winter periods of Tamil Nadu, India. It is known as manathakkali keerai (‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Æø ‡Æï‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Øà)in Tamil Nadu and kaage soppu in Karnataka, and apart from its use as a home remedy for mouth ulcers, is used in cooking like spinach. In North India, the boiled extracts of leaves and berries are also used to alleviate liver-related ailments, including jaundice. In Assam, the juice from its roots is used against asthma and whooping cough. S. nigrum is a widely used plant in oriental medicine where it is considered to be antitumorigenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, diuretic, and antipyretic. Some experiments indicate that the plant inhibits growth of cervical carcinoma in mice. The active ingredient of the plant, solanine, inhibits the proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro, such as breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.Its anti-tumor mechanism is mainly through the induction of different cell and molecular pathways, leading to apoptosis and autophagy of cells and molecules, and inhibiting tumor metastasis. Water extracts of Solanum nigrum have shown a citotoxic activity in reducing ROS generation of the human MM cell line A-375. Solanum nigrum is known to contain solasodine (a steroidal glycoalkaloid that can be used to make 16-DPA progenitor); a possible commercial source could be via cultivating the hairy roots of this plant. It is also a treatment of gastric ulcer. Through experiments on mice gastric ulcer model and control group, the results showed that the extract of black nightshade powder and methanol could significantly affect the secretion of gastric acid and protease in mice, thus significantly reducing the gastric ulcer index of mice. Solanum nigrum, Tasmannia pepper leaf, anise myrtle and lemon myrtle share a high concentration of polyphenols and polysaccharides, which take a role in inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 activities, resulting \\"a viable approach to inhibit inflammation and carcinogenesis and to prevent cancer.\\" Cultivation Black nightshade is cultivated as a food crop on several continents, including Africa and North America. The leaves of cultivated strains are eaten after cooking. A garden form with fruit diam. is occasionally cultivated. = Soil preparation = Select fertile, loose and easy to drain and irrigate strong seedlings. Use the plots of the previous crops that have not planted fruit and vegetables as seedbed. Dig deep and make a seedling bed with a width of 1m and a height of 15 cm with a fine rake.Before sowing, fill the seedbed with water, mix the seeds with fine sand and mix them evenly. Sow them sparsely to cultivate strong seedlings. Cover soil 0.5 cm after sowing.In winter and spring, seedlings should be raised in the small arch. In summer and autumn, seedlings can be raised in the small arch covered with sunshade net.When the seedlings 3-4 true leaves, thinning the growth potential of the weak seedlings, and timely weeding. Weed Black nightshade can be a serious agricultural weed when it competes with crops. It has been reported as a weed in 61 countries and 37 crops. Herbicides are used extensively to control it in field crops such as cotton.

Route The canal left the Hollinwood Branch Canal at Fairbottom Junction immediately above lock 22. It was just over one mile long (1.82 km) and it was lock free. It terminated at Fenny Fields Bridge, Bardsley, which is situated in the Medlock Valley between Ashton-under-Lyne and Oldham. History Although this canal was mainly rural, its main purpose was to carry coal so there was a loading stage for coal and a short private branch for the same purpose. There was also a mill. Immediately north east of the terminus at Fenny Fields Bridge an industrial community was founded at Park Bridge and a tramway, which included a small-bore tunnel long, connected the two together. This community was founded in 1783 by Samuel Lees to make rollers for the textile industry. This community expanded rapidly as the demand for textile machinery increased. Following the premature death of Samuel in 1804 the factory was successfully run by his widow Hannah Lees n√©e Buckley and in later years the company was renamed Hannah Lees & Sons in her honour. The last part of this works closed in 1963 due to the decline in the textile industry. left Around 1800, water was being supplied to this canal by Fairbottom Bobs, a Newcomen engine working for mine drainage. At first, waggon haulage on the tramway was by means of horses but early in the 1840s a steam locomotive called ‚ÄòThe Ashtonian‚Äô replaced them. Because of the narrow-bore tunnel, the driver needed to be of short stature and even then he had to kneel down to pass through the tunnel. The locomotive‚Äôs funnel also had to be removed. This tramway remained operational into the 1880s. In the early 1930s two leakages occurred that made it necessary to lower the water level in the canal and this, coupled with mining subsidence, caused its unofficial closure in 1932. By 1948 the canal was completely unnavigable but it did remain in water. Much of the line of the former canal remained intact and there are now plans to re-open part of it again as an amenity canal along with much of the Hollinwood Branch Canal.

Career McFarlane and Campsie originally met in California in 1978 and began working together when they returned to England, teaming up with guitarist/keyboardist Ivan Penfold and drummer Graham Broad. Augmented by guitarists Rob Greene and Danny McIntosh Jr., the band initially christened themselves Grand Hotel and in early 1979 released one album for CBS UK under the title Do Not Disturb. Later that year, Campsie and McFarlane resurfaced as The Quick. Their debut single, \\"Sharks Are Cool, Jets Are Hot\\" was released on CBS affiliate Epic Records in 1979. In 1981, the duo's single \\"Hip Shake Jerk\\" became a hit in Australia, reaching No. 12, and their first album On the Uptake was quickly released there. Remixed and repackaged as One Light in a Blackout (in Canada) and Fascinating Rhythm (in Europe) the album was released to the rest of the world in 1982, scoring a U.S. dance hit with \\"Zulu\\". The single \\"Rhythm of the Jungle\\" was another Top 20 success in Australia, reaching No. 13, and also became a hit in Europe. Stylistically, this inaugural period for the band was characterized by a hybrid of popular funk, dance, and new wave influences with an emphasis on bass and keyboards. By the early 1980s, McFarlane and Campsie had also started doing studio work for other musicians, producing an album for Endgames among others. The Quick's second album, International Thing, released by Epic in 1984, showed the band moving away from their earlier dance-friendly roots and adopting a more mainstream AOR approach and incorporating a variety of styles that expanded their previous boundaries to include a harder-edged rock sound. During this period, Campsie and McFarlane maintained a close friendship and professional alliance with British duo Go West. The Quick's final album, Wah Wah, released in 1986 on A&M; Records, was produced by The Cure bassist Phil Thornalley and saw the band moving sonically in an even heavier rock direction while still maintaining melodic pop sensibilities. Under Thornalley's direction, \\"Wah Wah\\" features dense 'wall of sound' production and heavy processing of instrumentation akin to that heard on the Trevor Horn-produced 90125 album by Yes (1984). McFarlane and Campsie returned to Los Angeles for their next project, teaming up with producer Gardner Cole, resurfacing as Giant Steps in 1988 and releasing their sole album The Book of Pride through A&M.; Book of Pride found Campsie and McFarlane returning to their dance/funk roots but with an updated rhythmic sense and keyboard-dominated sound displaying the influences of artists such as Prince, Morris Day & The Time, and Ready for the World. Working with R&B; producer Preston Glass, Campsie and McFarlane recorded three new Giant Steps songs in 1989; the ballad \\"Lonely 4 U\\", \\"Paint the Town Blue\\", and the uptempo \\"What We're Made Of\\" (featuring Larry Graham guesting on bass and vocals). A second Giant Steps album never materialized. From 1990 to 2010, Campsie was married to British vocalist Beverley Craven. Through his London-based company Song-Creator, McFarlane continues to be active as a songwriter, music producer, programmer, arranger and songwriting consultant, and has written music for television shows including CSI NY, The Late Show with David Letterman, Two and a Half Men, Sex and the City, American Idol, Good Morning America, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, among others. Girls Can't Help It In the early 1980s, Campsie and McFarlane put together a pop act, made up of Belinda ‚ÄúBillie‚Äù Adams, Katy Lynne and Peggy Sue Fender, and called them Girls Can't Help It.https://boogie80.com/playlist/girls-cant-help-it-baby-doll/ After their debut single \\"Baby Doll\\" was a top ten hit on Billboard's Disco/Dance chart, they signed to Sire Records and released a version of \\"Rhythm of the Jungle\\".

He was a first cousin of Emperor Akihito. Originally known as Prince Yoshihito of Mikasa, he received the title Prince Katsura (Katsura-no-miya) and authorization to start a new branch of the Imperial Family on 1 January 1988 at age 39. He died of a heart attack on 8 June 2014, aged 66.  Early life and education  Prince Tomohito, his mother Princess Mikasa, and his sister Princess Yasuko, c. 1950 The Prince was born at the Mikasa Family Home at Kami≈çsaki, Shinagawa, Tokyo. He graduated from the Department of Political Studies in the Faculty of Law of Gakushuin University in 1971. Between 1971 and 1973, he studied at the Graduate School of the Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia. After his return to Japan, he worked as an administrator at the Japan Broadcasting Corporation from 1974 to 1985.  Public service  In 1982, the Prince returned to Australia as part of the Japanese delegation in honor of the tenth anniversary of the Australia-Japan Society. He also visited New Zealand to strengthen ties and friendly diplomatic relations. Despite his disabilities following a series of strokes in 1988, he took an active role in public service, and appeared regularly at award ceremonies, diplomatic events, and as President of various charity organizations. In July 1997, Prince Katsura again visited Australia, to help promote an exhibition of the traditional sport of sumo, with exhibition matches held in Sydney and Melbourne.  Health issues and death  Prince Katsura suffered a series of strokes in May 1988 and had surgery for acute subdural hematoma. Finally he became paralyzed from the waist down, forcing him to use a wheelchair. Despite this, he remained active in public life and appeared regularly at award ceremonies, diplomatic events, and as president of various charity organizations. However, he had been hospitalized on and off since 2008 due to sepsis. In early 2014, the Prince was diagnosed with an unspecified illness that affected and deteriorated his heart. In the early morning hours of 8 June 2014, he suffered a massive heart attack, and despite best efforts he was pronounced dead at 10:50 AM local time. He was 66 years old. On 17 June 2014, the main funeral service for Prince Katsura, called \\"Renso no Gi\\", was held at Toshimagaoka Imperial Cemetery in Tokyo. About 560 dignitaries including the members of Imperial Family attended the funeral. Prince and Princess Mikasa, Prince Katsura's parents, acted out the duty of chief mourners and his niece, Princess Akiko, hosted the ceremony. =Significance= Prince Katsura never married and left no legitimate children. As his brothers only had daughters themselves, his death marked the end of his father's branch of the Imperial Family and also his own branch. As a result, the number of households in the Imperial family dropped to four, excluding those led by Emperor Akihito and Crown Prince Naruhito. He was survived by his parents.

It is the deepest gorge in the world. The upper part of the gorge is also called Thak Khola after the local Thakali people who became prosperous from trans-Himalayan trade. Geologically, the gorge is within a structural graben. Background The gorge separates the major peaks of Dhaulagiri () on the west and Annapurna () on the east. If one measures the depth of a canyon by the difference between the river height and the heights of the highest peaks on either side, the gorge is the world's deepest. The portion of the river directly between Dhaulagiri and Annapurna I (7 km downstream from Tukuche) is at an elevation of , lower than Annapurna I.Annapurna (1:100,000 map), Nepal-Kartenwerk der Arbeitgemeinschaft f√ºr vergleichende Hochgebirgsforschung Nr. 9, Nelles Verlag, Munich, 1993.

This region is known for shaligram fossils, revered as one of five non-living forms of Lord Vishnu. The Kali Gandaki river source coincides with the Tibetan border and Ganges- Brahmaputra watershed divide. The river then flows south through the ancient kingdom of Mustang. It flows through a sheer-sided, deep canyon immediately south of the Mustang capital of Lo Manthang, then widens as it approaches Kagbeni where high Himalayan ranges begin to close in. The river continues southward past Jomsom, Marpha, and Tukuche to the deepest part of the gorge about 7 km south of Tukuche in the area of Lete. The gorge then broadens past Dana and Tatopani toward Beni. The Kali Gandaki gorge has been used as a trade route between India and Tibet for centuries. Today, it is part of a popular trekking route from Pokhara to Muktinath, part of the Annapurna Circuit. The gorge is within the Annapurna Conservation Area.Nepal Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation website The pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki Gorge: Its 19th-century name was Kore La.

He was also known as \\"Mr. Magnificent\\" Kevin Kelly in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the 1980s. Professional wrestling career =Early Career (1982-1986)= Kevin Wacholz started wrestling in 1982 after winning a Toughman Contest. He wrestled in various territories in Tennessee, Montreal, Central States, and the Pacific Northwest. In 1985 he wrestled as Thor for World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas. Had feuds with Bobby Fulton and Brian Adias. That same year he worked with the same gimmick for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. In 1986 he worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling. =American Wrestling Association (1984-1988)= Wacholz debut in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) as Kevin Kelly in 1984, as a babyface midcarder. By 1986, he was a top heel and challenged for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship. He used the moniker, \\"Mr. Magnificent\\" Kevin Kelly. In 1987, he was managed by Sherri Martel and regularly issued arm wrestling challenges. This led to a feud with Tommy Rich, who answered one of his challenges on an edition of AWA Championship Wrestling on ESPN. Rich appeared to have the contest won, when Martel interfered on Kelly's behalf. In retaliation, Rich tore off her dress. Rich would then dominate a series of matches between the two. After Martel left the AWA, Kelly took Madusa Miceli as his manager. He often teamed with Nick Kiniski as \\"The Perfect Tag Team\\" to contend for the AWA World Tag Team Championship. He left the AWA in 1988, before it folded in 1991. =Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling (1990)= In June 1990, Kelly returned to Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling where he had a feud with Dick Murdoch. =World Wrestling Federation (1989-1992)= Wacholz, still performing under the name Kevin Kelly, received a tryout match on June 6, 1989 at a WWF Superstars taping in Madison, WI, defeating Tim Horner.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm A night later he defeated Jim Powers at a Wrestling Challenge taping, but was not signed to a contract that year. After the AWA folded, Wacholz received another tryout match, this time at a WWF Superstars taping on May 6, 1991, defeating Brian Costello. The following night at a Wrestling Challenge taping he defeated Gary Jackson in a dark match. In 1992, Wacholz debuted in the WWF as Nailz, an ex-convict who, in a series of promos, alleged he was abused by former prison guard Big Boss Man during his incarceration. He also claimed to be innocent of his (unspecified) crimes. Following Big Boss Man's squash of Dave Roulette on the May 30 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Nailz (dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit) attacked Boss Man, handcuffing him to the top rope before repeatedly hitting and choking him with his own nightstick., 8/29/08 Nailz easily defeated numerous jobbers en route to defeating Boss Man's ally Virgil at SummerSlam. He attacked Sgt. Slaughter before a match went ended in a no contest in September 1992. He continued to feud with Boss Man, who had recovered from Nailz's beating. The feud came to its climax when Big Boss Man defeated Nailz in a nightstick match at Survivor Series. Before Nailz finished the feud with Boss Man, he began another feud, this time with The Undertaker. The two had a stare down on the October 24 episode of Superstars, a photo of which was used as the cover of the January 1993 issue of WWF Magazine. He had a few matches losing to WWF Champion Bret Hart. Also he had a short feud with The Ultimate Warrior. However, Wacholz was released from his WWF contract in December 1992, after he allegedly attacked Vince McMahon in his office over a financial dispute, while John Nord watched the door. Bret Hart recalled in his autobiography that Wacholz \\"cornered Vince in his office and screamed at him for fifteen minutes\\". Hart claims he was just down the hall from the office when he heard a loud crash, which was Wacholz \\"knocking Vince over in his chair, choking him violently\\". The incident led to a series of lawsuits between Wacholz and the WWF. Wacholz alleged McMahon had given him steroids on a number of occasions; McMahon denied the claim. Wacholz then filed a wrongful termination lawsuit claiming McMahon sexually assaulted him.https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/top-15-shocking-accusations-made- against-vince-mcmahon/ The WWF filed a counterclaim against Wacholz, but both suits were later dropped. In 1994, Wacholz testified against McMahon during his trial on charges of supplying steroids to WWF wrestlers. He claimed McMahon had told him to take steroids.Nailz the Wrestler Testifies He Was Told to Use Steroids The New York Times (July 12, 1994). =Post-WWF (1993-2001)= After getting fired from the WWF, Wacholz began working in the independent circuit. Wacholz appeared at World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Slamboree event in 1993 as The Prisoner (looking identical to his Nailz persona), losing to Sting. From 1993 to 1997 he worked for Pro Wrestling America in Minnesota where he feuded with Road Warrior Hawk. He was World Wide Wrestling Alliance's heavyweight champion in 1994. He dropped the title to Brutus Beefcake on April 16. He wrestled in Jim Crockett's short-lived promotion, WWN, in 1994, as The Convict.

It lies six miles (10 km) south of Solihull and ten miles (16 km) northwest of Warwick. Lapworth boasts an historic church, the Church of St Mary the Virgin, a chapel and two National Trust sites: Baddesley Clinton, a medieval moated manor house and garden; and Packwood House, a Tudor manor house and yew garden with over 100 trees. The church is a building largely of the 13th and 14th centuries. It includes several unusual features: the steeple is connected by a passage to the north aisle and is built sheer with a projecting stair; the clerestory has square-headed windows; and there is a two-storey annex at the west end.Betjeman, John, ed.

At Kingswood Junction, the Grand Union Canal joins the Stratford-upon- Avon Canal, which has a major flight of locks. Catesby Lane in Lapworth is named after William Catesby (the father of Robert Catesby of Gunpowder Plot fame), whose family had been settled at Bushwood Hall, in the neighbouring parish of Bushwood, since the 14th century. The manor house was probably at Lapworth Hall, today Ireland's Farm, and in the 17th and 18th centuries the house of the Mander family of Wolverhampton. The furniture designer and maker Hugh Birkett worked from the late 1940s until 1966 in the garage at his parents' home in Lapworth. Examples of his work can be seen at Cheltenham Museum.  Transport  Lapworth railway station is on the Chiltern line from London to Birmingham. Originally called Kingswood, the station name was changed to Lapworth to avoid confusion with Kingswood station in Surrey. Junction 16 of the M40 motorway has only northbound entry and southbound exit to prevent traffic diverting through Hockley Heath as a shortcut to and from nearby junction 4 of the M42.

Owned by Broadway Media, the station's studios are located in Downtown Salt Lake City and its transmitter site is located southwest of the city on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains. History =KFMC= KOVO, Inc., received the construction permit for a radio station on 96.1 MHz in Provo on May 9, 1966. The new FM outlet took the call letters KFMC and signed on February 14, 1968. KOVO and KFMC were placed in receivership in 1973, after Glenn C. Shaw sued co-owner Ashley J. Robison asking for a financial accounting of KOVO, Inc.'s operations; when the case could not be settled, the stations were ordered into receivership and bids were accepted to buy the company. Both owners placed bids, but they were beaten out by First Media Corporation of Washington, D.C., whose principal was a former Utah resident and which also had J.W. Marriott Jr. as an investor. However, First Media did not become the owner of KOVO-KFMC until 1976 because the other parties appealed the district court's decision all the way to the Utah Supreme Court. =KAYK-FM and KFMY= First Media immediately made a mark on the operations of both stations, changing the call letters of KFMC to KAYK-FM on June 1, 1976. KAYK-AM-FM simulcast as adult contemporary outlet \\"K-96\\". The stations remained a simulcast until 1980, when 960 AM broke off as KDOT. The call letters were changed to KFMY in 1981, but the station moved in a contemporary hit radio direction. K-96 was Glenn Beck's first job out of high school; Beck worked at the station for six months in 1983 before leaving Provo. In 1987, First Media announced it would sell its 11 radio stations, including KFMY-AM-FM, to a partnership of Alaskan Eskimos and New York investors, known as Cook Inlet; this gave First Media a tax break under policies that promoted minority ownership of radio stations. =KZOL= Under Cook Inlet, KFMY-FM flipped to oldies in 1988 as KZOL. The Great Stock Company of Vast International Import acquired KFMY-KZOL in 1990 from Cook Inlet for $972,000. =KXRK= The slumping KZOL, however, went through a major change in 1992, precipitated as much by events at another Salt Lake City-area station as by its own poor performance. In late 1991, 23 of the 25 disc jockeys at alternative outlet KJQN-FM (95.5), known as \\"KJQ\\", quit after the station hired a new general manager, making them question the ownership's commitment to its \\"modern music\\" format. The result was that on February 13, 1992, with the financial backing of concert promoter J. C. McNeil, many of the former KJQ airstaff, organizing as the Acme Broadcasting Company, started a new alternative rocker on the former KZOL as KXRK \\"X96\\". The Great Stock Company said that because of KZOL's unsatisfactory ratings performance as an adult contemporary outlet, it was willing to entertain brokering the station to Acme, which retained KZOL's sales and office staff but none of its air personalities. The result was an unusual format war between \\"new rock outlets\\" which ended when KJQN-FM flipped to CHR in October. Ex-KJQ DJs on the new X96 included Bill Allred (mornings), Dom Casual (mornings), Andrea Gappmayer (mid- day), Mike Summers (afternoon), Todd Nuke'em (evening) and Chet Tapp (overnight). Acme acquired the station from Great Stock in 1993 for $925,000; the application included a copy of a lawsuit filed by the former KJQN-FM, alleging that its former employees took equipment, including a live truck known as the \\"Milk Beast\\", when they defected, and that the ex-KJQ staffers used KJQN-owned trademarks and made defamatory remarks about their former station. Since fall 1995, X96 has hosted an annual all-day music festival called the Big Ass Show (BASh) featuring nationally touring alternative and punk bands, as well as providing a stage for local bands. In 1996, X96 underwent a major technical overhaul, moving to 96.3 MHz from a transmitter on Farnsworth Peak, increasing its coverage area (particularly in Utah County). In April 1998, Acme sold KXRK to Simmons Media Group. Simmons moved X96 to studios located on the corner of Broadway and 2nd West in Salt Lake City. In its 2006 summer double issue, Rolling Stone named KXRK one of five \\"awesome rock outlets\\" that were thriving in their markets despite a recent contraction in rock radio stations across the United States. In 2014, Broadway Media acquired Simmons Media Group for $11 million after having taken over operations the previous year. Broadway moved X96 and its sister stations to new studios on 50 W. Broadway (300 S.) in downtown Salt Lake City; the company currently houses seven stations at this location.

It was to leave the Stockport Branch Canal in South Reddish and it was to be lock free but with a short tunnel. It was to follow the contour above the right bank of the River Tame, firstly in a northerly direction and then easterly as it followed the meandering course of the river upstream. It was to terminate at or near to the coalmining hamlet of Beat Bank in Denton where it could also secure supplies of coal from nearby mines at Haughton Green. History The Stockport Branch Canal and the Beat Bank Branch Canal were both authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained by the Proprietors of the Ashton Canal in March 1793, just nine months after the Act which authorised the main line of the canal. This second Act also authorised the Hollinwood Branch Canal, and allowed the Proprietors to raise ¬£30,000 to fund the construction of all three branches. The Hollingwood branch opened in late 1796, and the Stockport branch followed in January 1797. Construction of the Beat Bank branch was difficult, as it was on a clay slope at the edge of the Tame Valley, which was liable to slippage, and once the Ashton Canal Company had secured an adequate coal- carrying business on the Hollinwood Branch Canal and the Fairbottom Branch Canal, they decided to suspend all work on the unfinished Beat Bank Branch Canal. They informed William Hulton, the owner of the coal mines at Denton, that they could not afford to complete the work. An Act of Parliament obtained in 1798 allowed the Canal Company to raise further money and abandon the unfinished canal. Its progress through Parliament was opposed by Hulton, who declined an initial offer of the unfinished canal, but he was unsuccessful in his opposition. Some of the money raised was used to pay compensation to land and property owners along the line of the canal for loss or damage caused by the activities of the Canal Company. Route Only a very short length of the canal was put in water at Reddish and this was known as the Beat Bank or Reddish Private Branch. Just beyond the watered section, the plans showed a tunnel, but construction of this was not started. Beyond the tunnel, most of the bed was excavated for a distance of around . No work was done on the section between there and the site of a proposed reservoir, and then another section of around was built, but the final length to the collieries was not. Sections of this canal still remain along Reddish Vale Allotments, to the right of Ross Lave Lane and past the M60 viaduct. The engineers who built the M60 viaduct used the same contours as those who built the Beat Bank branch canal and subsequently severed it. The 1848 Ordnance Survey map shows about of canal running from the junction towards the site of the tunnel, but there are no buildings to indicate what it might have been used for.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1848 By 1893, only about half of it was left,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1893 and by 1907, an engineering works had been built beside the railway, and the remains of the canal are shown as little more than a widening of the main line at the location of the former junction.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1907 Points of interest See also * Canals of the United Kingdom * History of the British canal system Bibliography * * =References= Category:Canals in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport Category:Canals in Tameside ","title":"Beat Bank Branch Canal"},{"id":"2187562","text":"The 2000 Pacific hurricane season was an above-average Pacific hurricane season, although most of the storms were weak and short-lived. There were few notable storms this year. Tropical Storms Miriam, Norman, and Rosa all made landfall in Mexico with minimal impact. Hurricane Daniel briefly threatened the U.S. state of Hawaii while weakening. Hurricane Carlotta was the strongest storm of the year and the second-strongest June hurricane in recorded history. Carlotta killed 18 people when it sank a freighter. Overall, the season was significantly more active than the previous season, with 19 tropical storms. In addition, six hurricanes developed. Furthermore, there were total of two major hurricanes, Category 3 or greater on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. It officially started on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30, 2000. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. Seasonal activity began on May 22, when Hurricane Aletta formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. Two storms formed in June, though the season became slowly active in July when three named storms developed, including Hurricane Daniel which was the second-strongest storm of the season. During August, Hurricanes Gilma and Hector formed, as well as four other storms. September was a relatively quiet month with two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane. Two storms developed in October including Tropical Storm Olivia and only formed in November; when one tropical storm developed in the basin during the month. __TOC__ Seasonal summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2000 till:01/12/2000 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2000 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:20/05/2000 till:28/05/2000 color:C2 text:\\"Aletta (C2)\\" from:13/06/2000 till:17/06/2000 color:TS text:\\"Bud (TS)\\" from:18/06/2000 till:25/06/2000 color:C4 text:\\"Carlotta (C4)\\" from:06/07/2000 till:07/07/2000 color:TD text:\\"Four-E (TD)\\" from:20/07/2000 till:23/07/2000 color:TS text:\\"Upana (TS)\\" from:22/07/2000 till:23/07/2000 color:TD text:\\"Five-E (TD)\\" from:23/07/2000 till:05/08/2000 color:C3 text:\\"Daniel (C3)\\" barset:break from:26/07/2000 till:30/07/2000 color:TS text:\\"Emilia (TS)\\" from:03/08/2000 till:08/08/2000 color:TS text:\\"Fabio (TS)\\" from:05/08/2000 till:11/08/2000 color:C1 text:\\"Gilma (C1)\\" from:10/08/2000 till:16/08/2000 color:C1 text:\\"Hector (C1)\\" from:13/08/2000 till:17/08/2000 color:TS text:\\"Ileana (TS)\\" from:15/08/2000 till:17/08/2000 color:TS text:\\"Wene (TS)\\" from:28/08/2000 till:01/09/2000 color:TS text:\\"John (TS)\\" barset:break from:31/08/2000 till:03/09/2000 color:TS text:\\"Kristy (TS)\\" from:05/09/2000 till:14/09/2000 color:C2 text:\\"Lane (C2)\\" from:15/09/2000 till:17/09/2000 color:TS text:\\"Miriam (TS)\\" from:20/09/2000 till:22/09/2000 color:TS text:\\"Norman (TS)\\" from:02/10/2000 till:10/10/2000 color:TS text:\\"Olivia (TS)\\" from:25/10/2000 till:29/10/2000 color:TS text:\\"Paul (TS)\\" from:03/11/2000 till:08/11/2000 color:TS text:\\"Rosa (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2000 till:01/06/2000 text:May from:01/06/2000 till:01/07/2000 text:June from:01/07/2000 till:01/08/2000 text:July from:01/08/2000 till:01/09/2000 text:August from:01/09/2000 till:01/10/2000 text:September from:01/10/2000 till:01/11/2000 text:October from:01/11/2000 till:01/12/2000 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" The accumulated cyclone energy index for the 2000 Pacific hurricane season, is 95.35 units. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of . The season officially started on May 15, 2000 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 2000 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2000. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This season had an above average number of storms. However, it had a below-average number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. There were also two tropical depressions that did not reach storm strength. In the central Pacific, two tropical storms formed. The first storm formed on May 22 and the last storm dissipated on November 8. Systems =Hurricane Aletta= A tropical wave crossed Central America and entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec on May 20. Deep convection developed near a center, and the system became the first tropical depression of the season on May 22 while located south of Acapulco, Mexico. A mid-level ridge forced a west-northwest track away from the Mexican coast. It intensified into Tropical Storm Aletta early on May 23 while located south of Zihuatanejo, Mexico, becoming the first May tropical storm in four years. As it turned westward, it continued a slow intensification trend, before strengthening more quickly due to decreased wind shear. On May 24, Aletta attained hurricane status, and shortly thereafter reached peak winds of ; this made it a Category 2 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, Aletta began a weakening trend due to increasing wind shear. At around the same time, a trough eroded the ridge that was steering the movement of Aletta, causing the hurricane to remain almost stationary for the next two days. The lack of motion resulted in upwelling which imparted additional weakening, and Aletta weakened to tropical storm status on May 27. It quickly deteriorated that day, and on May 28 the system dissipated well south of Cabo San Lucas after it began a slow north drift. The remnants lingered in the same area for the next several days. Aletta caused no known damages or casualties. Hurricane Aletta was the second- strongest May hurricane by pressure, as well as the fourth strongest May hurricane by winds. =Tropical Storm Bud= A tropical wave that eventually became Tropical Storm Bud was first identified off the coast of Africa on May 22. It moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, then into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 6 with little development. The tropical wave remained disorganized until June 11 when a broad low-pressure area developed southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The wave was only intensifying slowly, and on June 13, it became strong enough to be designated as a tropical depression. It quickly strengthened to tropical storm intensity six hours later, and moved to the northwest. It was forecast to strengthen to a strong tropical storm with winds reaching , but the storm only reached a peak intensity of early on June 14. Bud turned to the north-northwest, and slowly weakened from June 15 onwards, due to increasing vertical wind shear and cooler ocean water temperatures. The storm's forward speed decreased and began to meander, as the ridge to the north of Bud weakens and a trough develops over the western United States. It drifted erratically while located just north of Socorro Island, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on June 16. By the next day, it dissipated into an area of low pressure; however, it continued to exist until June 19. Bud passed near Socorro Island on June 15, with estimated one-minute winds of , and caused large waves along the western coast of Mexico. However, no reports of damage or casualties were received. =Hurricane Carlotta= A tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean acquired a closed circulation and became a depression on June 18. It strengthened into a storm June 19 and a hurricane the next day. Carlotta then began explosively deepening, and it strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on June 21. It then began to reduce its forward speed and slowly weaken as its path paralleled the Pacific coast of Mexico. Carlotta weakened to a storm on June 24 and a depression June 25. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. Though it never made landfall, Carlotta killed 18 people when it sank the Lithuanian freighter M/V Linkuva. Carlotta is also the third-most intense June tropical cyclone in the east Pacific; only Ava of 1973 and Celia of 2010 were stronger. =Tropical Depression Four-E= Tropical Depression Four-E was a short-lived storm that formed from the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Depression Two in the Atlantic Ocean. The tropical wave crossed Central America between June 30 and July 1, continuing to move westward into the Pacific Ocean. The wave became more organized on July 6 and the National Hurricane Center started issuing advisories on the newly developed tropical depression later that day. The hurricane center predicted that the depression will reach tropical storm intensity, as there was a lack of vertical wind shear around the system and sea surface temperatures were warm enough for intensification to occur. The depression lacked any deep convection, however, and it began weakening on the next day. It was dissipating late in the day as the storm moved into an area of stronger wind shear. =Tropical Storm Upana= A tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression One-C on July 20 while located southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. It strengthened slowly and moved nearly due west, before reaching storm strength later on July 20. The storm was named Upana, which is Hawaiian for \\"Urban\\". Despite a favorable environment, Upana strengthened little, reaching a peak intensity on July 21 with winds of . The storm had no deep convection in its circulation on July 22, and was downgraded to a tropical depression in the afternoon. Late on July 23, deep convection flared up, briefly strengthening the storm, but failed to become a tropical storm again, as it remained poorly organized. It dissipated on July 24, despite a low-shear environment favorable for development. Upana is the first storm in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility to be named in July, and the first tropical storm to develop in the region since Tropical Storm Paka in the 1997 season. Upana's remnants continued moving to the west, where JMA classified its remnants a tropical depression, but east of the International Date Line on July 27. It crossed the International Date Line later that day. The remnants encountered a favorable environment just west of the dateline, and developed into Tropical Depression 12W. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Chanchu. The name chanchu, submitted by Macau, is a Cantonese word for pearl. Chanchu moved north, and had dissipated by July 30. Gary Padgett suggested that there was good evidence Chanchu was actually a regeneration of Upana. The official policy is that dateline crossers keep their name. However, there was supposedly some doubt at the time so Chanchu and Upana were officially treated as distinct tropical cyclones. Also, since Upana had dissipated several days earlier, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center had already assigned a new number for the system, Gary Padgett deemed it likely that the Japan Meteorological Agency's decision to rename the cyclone was the best choice. =Tropical Depression Five-E= The origins of Tropical Depression Five-E were first identified on July 8 when a tropical wave moved off the west African coast. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16 after tracking over the Caribbean Sea. The wave developed to a tropical depression on July 22. It lacked any deep convection and it was moving over cold waters, so it never intensified further to a tropical storm. The depression dissipated late on July 23, one day after it formed to a depression. =Hurricane Daniel= Hurricane Daniel reached Category 3 intensity and briefly threatened Hawaii as a tropical storm, but veered to the northwest as it approached the islands. No casualties or damaged was reported in association with Hurricane Daniel, despite the system's passing close enough to Hawaii to require tropical storm warnings. It still produced heavy surf conditions along the northern shores of the Hawaiian Islands. Daniel was the first tropical cyclone to be a significant threat to Hawaii since 1994. =Tropical Storm Emilia= On July 11, a tropical wave moved off the African coast, and moved to the Lesser Antilles one week later. It passed over Central America near Panama on July 22 without any increase in organization. On July 25, the wave began to show curved banding, showing that it had become better organized. It intensified to a tropical depression on July 26 while located south southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, designated as Tropical Depression Seven-E. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Emilia later that day while moving northwest, steered by a mid-level ridge to its north. During this time, Emilia was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane within two days, due to the system moving over warm waters. However, late on July 27, the storm began to accelerate, meaning that it will move into cooler waters sooner than firstly anticipated, therefore, only allowing the storm to intensify within a few hours before weakening. Emilia moved near Socorro Island and its intensity peaked with wind speeds of , with an eyewall beginning to form. A few hours later, the storm moved into cooler waters and drier air, and Emilia's deep convection dissipated, weakening the storm. Late on July 28 deep convection redeveloped near the storm's center, but wind shear prevented Emilia from strengthening. It turned to the west and weakened below tropical storm intensity on July 29, as the deep convection in the storm diminished again. It shortly dissipated while located several hundred miles west south-west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. =Tropical Storm Fabio= A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on July 19, and entered into the Pacific on July 27. Minimal development occurred in the west-northwestward moving wave until August 1. It was then that the tropical wave began developing a low-level circulation and convective organization was seen to the south of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. The system continued to become better organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Eight-E, which was centered about west-southwest of Manzanillo on August 3 at 1200 UTC. The depression initially moved west-northwestward about , and later slowed and turned westward on August 4. As the depression had curved westward, it had intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Fabio. Despite the presence of wind shear, Fabio continued to strengthen and reach a peak intensity of later that day. Fabio turned toward west-southwest while weakening on August 5. Fabio weakened back to a tropical depression on August 6 and dissipated two days later about west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The remnant swirl of low clouds persisted for several more days, eventually undergoing a Fujiwhara interaction with the remains of Hurricane Gilma. =Hurricane Gilma= Gilma was a Category 1 hurricane (on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale) that took a climatological west-northwesterly track over the open waters of the eastern North Pacific. =Hurricane Hector= In the middle of August, two tropical storms developed off the Mexican coastline. Hector became a hurricane and moved out to sea, and Ileana became a strong tropical storm that neared, but never made landfall on the Mexican coastline. Hector formed southwest of Mexico, moved westward and dissipated over colder water southwest of Baja California. The remnants of Hector passed over the Hawaiian Islands several days later, producing heavy rain over most of the island chain. =Tropical Storm Ileana= Ileana was a strong tropical storm that briefly threatened the southwest coast of mainland Mexico and the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula before abruptly turning away from Baja California and dissipating over open water. =Tropical Storm Wene= A tropical disturbance developed in the Western Pacific Ocean along the eastern periphery of the monsoon trough in mid-August. Located at 33¬∞ north, it steadily organized, and became Tropical Depression Sixteen-W on August 15 while located to the northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. It moved eastward along the west-east oriented surface pressure trough, and crossed the International Date Line later on August 15. Abnormally warm sea surface temperatures allowed the system to intensify despite its unusually high latitude, and it became Tropical Storm Wene on August 16. It quickly attained a peak intensity of , but weakened due to colder sea surface temperatures and wind shear. Wene continued to weaken, and dissipated when the storm merged with an extratropical cyclone. As a depression, Wene was the first Western Pacific tropical cyclone to cross the dateline since the 1996 season. The name Wene is Hawaiian for \\"Wayne\\". The system formed at the second-northernmost latitude of any storm in the East Pacific basin. =Tropical Storm John= John originated on August 28 from an area of disturbed weather that was associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) near just outside the Central Pacific basin. Developing near the Central Pacific basin, John eventually entered early on August 30 and was then also monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. that was a tropical storm for several days and moved from the eastern to the central Pacific basin. Thereafter entering the central Pacific region, Tropical Storm John approached hurricane status while meandering erratically east-southeast of Hawaii. John eventually encountered strong wind shear, and dissipated on September 1. Tropical Storm John did not cause any damage or fatalities, as there were no reports of any land being affect. =Tropical Storm Kristy= Part of the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Storm Chris in the Atlantic uneventfully crossed the rest of the Atlantic and passed far out to sea into the Pacific before it organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 31. Despite significant shear, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kristy as it meandered far from land over the open ocean. Wind shear then dissipated the system on September 3, just 210 kilometers from where it first organized. =Hurricane Lane= The precursor to Lane was a tropical wave that formed in the Atlantic Ocean on August 20. The wave moved across the Atlantic basin without development and crossed Central America on August 29. By September 1, the system was beginning to organize south of Mexico. On September 4, the system became a tropical depression southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The next day the tropical depression became Tropical Storm Lane. After becoming a tropical storm, Lane executed a counter-clockwise loop, during that maneuver, the storm crossed its own wake and weakened slightly. After the storm finished the loop, it continued to move westward where it reached hurricane strength on September 9 while passing over Socorro Island. By September 11, Lane encountered cooler waters which weakened the hurricane back to tropical storm strength. Lane then encountered a trough that had formed off the western United States coastline. The interaction with the system caused Lane to curve northeast towards the West Coast of the United States. On September 13, Lane passed over cooler waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression. Lane then dissipated on the next day. On September 9, forecasters predicted that the storm would remain offshore and its rainbands would bring heavy rains and gusty winds across the Baja California. However, because forecasters predicted that the storm would stay offshore, and so no warnings or watches were issued. Lane passed directly over Socorro Island where a weather station recorded a pressure of 973 mb. Although the center of Lane was well offshore, it still brought heavy surf that closed several ports in Mexico. In an Jose del Cabo, Mexico, a weather station reported winds of . Lane remnants then affected the Western United States. The moisture from Lane produced thunderstorms in California. At all locations, effects were minimal, with no reports of damage or casualties. =Tropical Storm Miriam= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 29. It remained weak as it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and entered the Pacific Ocean on September 9. As it moved west-northwestward, it organized, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on September 15 while east-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. Banding features became more pronounced, though convection remained intermittent. On September 16, the depression briefly became Tropical Storm Miriam, though quickly weakened back to a tropical depression as it continued north-northwestward. Miriam dissipated on September 17 while northeast of Cabo San Lucas. Tropical storm force winds were never reported, and it is possible Miriam never attained tropical storm status. Miriam dropped lighter than average rainfall upon Mexico, peaking at at La Cruz/Elota. Total damages from the storm amounted to $7.2 million (MXN; $558,000 in 2000 USD, $ in USD). By October 24, a national disaster declaration was signed for areas affected by Tropical Storm Miriam in Baja California Sur. =Tropical Storm Norman= The same tropical wave that spawned Atlantic Hurricane Gordon organized into an area of low pressure in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on September 18. Its convection slowly organized while south of Mexico, and a tropical depression formed on September 20 while south-southeast of Manzanillo, Colima. Weak steering currents forced the depression to drift slowly northward, and later on September 20 it strengthened into Tropical Storm Norman. Norman quickly reached peak winds of before making landfall in western Mexico. The storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over land, but Norman maintained its circulation and some deep convection as it turned to the northwest. It emerged over water on September 22, but turned to the northeast, made landfall again in Mexico, and dissipated later that day. Norman produced heavy rainfall across western Mexico, peaking at nearly in the stacote of Colima. In all, Norman caused $13.3 million (2000 USD; $ USD) in damage. =Tropical Storm Olivia= Olivia was a tropical storm that formed off the southwest coast of mainland Mexico, and generally tracked west- northwestward and remained over open water. After dissipating as a tropical cyclone, the remnant low-level circulation tracked across central Baja California, northwest Mexico and the desert southwest United States. =Tropical Storm Paul= An area of disturbed weather emerged from the ITCZ on October 22. Located several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, convection gradually organized and increased, and by October 25 satellite images indicated the development of the eighteenth tropical depression of the season. Operationally it was not classified until 15 hours later. The depression moved westward throughout its duration, and based on Dvorak estimates, intensified into Tropical Storm Paul on October 26. Despite increasing wind shear ahead of the storm, the National Hurricane Center predicted steady intensification to near hurricane status, although Paul only attained peak winds of . As wind shear increased and convection became disorganized, Paul weakened. A trough briefly curved it to the northwest, before resuming its westward motion. Although the convection was becoming displaced from the low-level circulation, the National Hurricane Center continued to predict strengthening. However, the thunderstorms became minimal, and Paul weakened to a tropical depression early on October 28. The circulation center deteriorated, and although there were bursts in convection, Paul dissipated early on October 29, as it was becoming indistinguishable in the ITCZ. The remnants continued westward, and interacted with an upper-level low, affecting Hawaii with heavy rainfall in early November. The flooding caused $70 million in damage, and the highest rainfall total was at Kapapala Ranch. That rainfall total makes Paul the third rainiest tropical cyclone in Hawaii, behind only Hurricane Hiki and Hurricane Lane of 1950 and 2018, respectively. =Tropical Storm Rosa= The origins of Tropical Storm Rosa can be traced to a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 18. It showed signs of development in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, though moved into the East Pacific Ocean on November 1 before being able to develop further. Favorable conditions allowed the system to quickly organize, and the wave formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 3 while south of the El Salvador‚ÄìGuatemala border. A ridge of high pressure to its north forced the depression westward, where it slowly organized into a tropical storm on November 5. A mid-level trough eroded the high pressure system, allowing Rosa to turn more to the north. On November 6, the storm reached a peak of , though Rosa slowly weakened as it accelerated to the northeast. On November 8, the storm made landfall on the southern coast of Mexico with winds of , and quickly dissipated. Rosa dropped moderate rainfall across Mexico, peaking at near the Mexico/Guatemala border. Damage was minimal, totaling to only $15,000 (2000 USD; $ USD). Rosa was the first November storm since Hurricane Rick in the 1997 season. Other storms =Tropical Depression Chanchu= On July 26, a tropical depression formed east of the International Date Line from the possible remnants of Upana, and it quickly exited the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. However, this storm was not included in the CPHC database. As it crossed into the western Pacific, it strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name Chanchu. Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2000 USD. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 2000. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray No names were retired, so it was used again in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.

The Hollywood Reporter called him \\"a television and nightclub mainstay for more than six decades\\" who made thousands of nightclub and television appearances.  Early life  Charles Taylor Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Elizabeth Sue Evans (1911‚Äì2000),https://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/28/comedian-mourns-his- mother-but-the-show-goes-on/ a waitress and former government clerk, and Charles Elmer Taylor (died 1933), a musician. His father died when he was 2 years old. As described in his 2010 one-man show It Ain't All Confetti, Taylor had a tough childhood, which included being molested while in foster care and having to deal with bullies in school. As a teenager he attended Capitol Page School. Taylor worked as a congressional page before serving in the Korean War; he was in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Although assigned to the Corps, he was sent to Special Services, the entertainment wing of the military, where he performed for the troops in Tokyo and Korea.  Career  = Early career = Taylor's career in show business began when he joined the U.S. Army, where he started performing stand-up in clubs and restaurants abroad while also performing for the troops. After his military service, and back in the U.S., he focused on a nightclub career. His mainstay material was \\"pantomiming records, his favorites were Yiddish folk songs and Spike Jones tunes.\\" He said that ended one day when the record player broke, \\"I haven't shut up since.\\" In the mid-1950s he worked the strip clubs all along the Eastern coast of the U.S. Although a lot of his material were jokes stolen from acts he saw in USO shows, his first signature piece would be to pretend to cry while begging the audience for laughs. He found he could get a bigger response that way. His bookings started to get more upscale and he played all over Miami Beach, Florida, which had become a winter destination for the wealthy. Taylor was also a mainstay in the summer playground of the wealthy in the Catskills Mountains. A booking agent from The Ed Sullivan Show attended his show one night. Taylor would spend a week's salary on champagne to get the audience boisterous. He first appeared on the show in 1961 and made about twenty appearances. Sullivan would forget his name, saying \\"Get me the crying comedian.\\" = Television and film = In addition to the Ed Sullivan Show, Taylor appeared on The Jackie Gleason Show in several guest appearances during the 1963‚Äì1964 season as \\"the crying comedian\\". Taylor's signature confetti tossing gag came from an appearance in the 1960s The Merv Griffin Show where he was bombing as a stand-up comedian. \\"I did props and I was 'The Prop Comedian.' I was dying like hell on Merv Griffin's show. The jokes were dumb, and I tore the five by eight cards, threw them up in the air and it became confetti,\\" he recalled. \\"I knocked over his desk, walked up the aisle, went to Sardi's and said, 'Well, that's the end of my television career.' I went home that night. Their switchboard had lit up. They said, 'Get the guy that went crazy!'\\" Taylor became somewhat of a fixture in Las Vegas. He was the opener for Eleanor Powell's dance-focused revue, and would go on to warm up audiences for headliners \\"Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Ann-Margret, Debbie Reynolds, Frankie Laine, Judy Garland and The Kingston Trio\\". In the 1970s he won Las Vegas Entertainer of the Year three times. He appeared in two 1968 episodes of The Monkees as well as having a cameo in their 1969 special Revolutions per Monkee. He continued to work as a voice performer in the 1970s cartoon series Here Comes the Grump, as the title character, and in the second edition of The Addams Family cartoon series in 1992, as the voice of Uncle Fester. Throughout the 1970s, Taylor was a frequent celebrity guest panelist on television game shows such as Hollywood Squares, To Tell the Truth, and The Gong Show, and substituted for Charles Nelson Reilly on Match Game. He became a regular on Sid and Marty Krofft's Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, playing Sheldon, a sea- genie who lived in a conch shell. In addition, Taylor was also a regular on The Brady Bunch Hour, playing the role of neighbor/performer Jack Merrill. He also hosted a short-lived send-up of beauty pageants titled The $1.98 Beauty Show, created by Chuck Barris in 1978, producer/host of The Gong Show. Taylor appeared as a celebrity on the 1990 version of Match Game. In 1979, he was the voice of C.J. from the Hanna-Barbera television movie Scooby Goes Hollywood. Taylor's other appearances also include The Kids in the Hall; referred to as Uncle Rip by Buddy Cole, the show's most flamboyantly gay character. He also appeared as himself in the movie Wayne's World 2, one of the special guests invited to \\"WayneStock\\" after being visited in a dream by Jim Morrison. Taylor made \\"dozens of mayhem-filled appearances\\" on both The Tonight Show and The Mike Douglas Show. In 1990, he voiced the genie in DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp.

In the early 2000s, Johnny Knoxville asked Taylor to be in the film Jackass: The Movie (2002). and in the final scene, he wielded a pistol that, when fired, released a sign that read \\"The End.\\" He did the same thing at the ending of Jackass Number Two, and Jackass 3D. In the credits of the 2005 remake of The Dukes of Hazzard, Taylor shows up in the blooper reel. Taylor made occasional appearances in movies, usually in broad comedies like The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington (1977) and the R-rated Deep Throat parody Chatterbox (1977). In Cheech & Chong's Things Are Tough All Over (1982), he picks them up in the middle of nowhere driving a convertible full of props. He then proceeds to drive them to Las Vegas and telling jokes the whole way and moving Chong to tears from laughter (and, later, tears because he won't stop). In Amazon Women on the Moon (1987) a funeral service turns into a celebrity roast when guest Rip Taylor shows up to \\"honor\\" the deceased.

In 990 Arduin became Margrave of Ivrea and in 991 Count of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran in Rome. In 1002, after the death of Emperor Otto III, the Italian nobles elected him King of Italy in the Basilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, making him the first non-German on the Italian throne in 41 years. Arduin was considered the choice of the nobility and opposed by the episcopate, but he was initially supported by the Archbishop of Milan. In Germany, however, Henry II was elected to succeed Otto, and he contested Arduin's election in Italy. In 1004, Henry invaded Italy, defeated Arduin and was crowned king in Pavia. He soon withdrew back to Germany, and Arduin was able to reassert his authority at least in the northwest of Italy for the next decade. Henry II invaded Italy again in 1014 and was proclaimed Emperor in Rome, at which point Arduin was finally forced to relinquish his crown. He died soon after at the Abbey of Fruttuaria, ending the independence of the Kingdom of Italy from Germany. The study of Arduin's reign has been bedeviled by the many forged diplomas in his name. These caused older scholarship to overrate his importance after Henry's first expedition in 1004, but it is now clear that Arduin's sphere of influence was restricted to a small part of Italy after that. He did, however, have continuing support in Pavia. Background Arduin was born around 955 in Pombia during a period in which the Kingdom of Italy was struggling to maintain its independence from the ambitions of the Holy Roman Empire. Italy was conquered in 961 by Emperor Otto I, and the Italian King Berengar II was deposed. Arduin, Berengar's grand-nephew, was only a boy when this happened. Although Otto unified the crowns of Italy and Germany, this did not erase the influence of Berengar's Anscarid dynasty in northern Italy, as the March of Ivrea was inherited by Berengar's third son Conrad. In the subsequent years, the political situation in Northern Italy was marked by the struggle between the bishops (who at the time were high-ranking nobles appointed by the Emperor himself to rule the largest fiefs, and who thus owed their fortune to their personal relationship with him) and the minor nobles, whose only source of livelihood were small, rural fiefs, and who were threatened by the expansionism of the bishops. Biography =Margrave of Ivrea= Arduin was born around 955 in Pombia and named after his maternal grandfather, Arduin Glaber. His father, Dado, Count of Pombia, was a nephew of King Berengar II. Arduin married Bertha, who is often said to be the daughter of Otbert II, Margrave of Milan. They had three sons: Arduin (sometimes called Ardicino), Otto, and Guibert. From them descended the later counts of Ivrea and in turn those of Agli√®, Brosso, Castellamonte, Front and Rivarolo. In 990, Arduin succeeded his kinsman Conrad in the March of Ivrea. Conrad was Berengar II's son and was married to a daughter of Arduin Glaber. It is unclear if Arduin was appointed to Ivrea by the king‚Äìemperor Otto III or if he succeeded as Conrad's heir. The March of Ivrea, since its restructuring under Berengar II in 950, consisted of the counties of Burgaria, Ivrea, Lomello, Ossola, Pombia, Stazzona and Vercelli, and the dioceses of Ivrea, Novara, Vercelli, and Vigevano, plus part of the dioceses Pavia and Milan. Arduin became Count of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran in Rome in 991. During his rule in Ivrea, Arduin backed the claims of the monastic orders and of the minor nobles, a policy that inevitably led to clashes with the imperially appointed bishops. The hostility turned into open conflict in the year 997, when the Emperor Otto III granted to Pietro, Bishop of Vercelli, the fief of Caresana. Arduin did not recognise the donation. There were riots in the city of Vercelli between the knights and the bishop's followers, during which the bishop was killed. Arduin intervened in the city, formally to restore order; during the clashes, the cathedral, where the bishop had been interred, was burned. The bishop-count Warmund of Ivrea condemned Arduin for the killing of Pietro, excommunicated him, and obtained from the Emperor a proclamation that the city of Ivrea, along with the land for three miles outside the walls, was free from Arduin's rule. In the year 1000 Arduin was in Rome to explain his position to the newly appointed Pope Sylvester II. Otto III was also present in the city, and Warmund and Leone, successor of Pietro as the bishop of Vercelli, probably were as well, and the pope confirmed Arduin's excommunication and demanded he abdicate to his title in favor of his son. Arduin did not accept the sentence. He returned in his lands, and, instead of abdicating, expelled Warmund from Ivrea and rapidly conquered the cities of Vercelli and Novara, while his followers took control of Como and several cities of the Piedmont. The fortified church of Santa Croce at Sparone, also known as the Rocca di Sparone or Rocca di Arduino, is the site where, according to tradition, Arduin held out against the besieging Emperor Henry =King of Italy= At that point a clash with the Emperor seemed inevitable, but Otto III suddenly died near Rome on 23 January 1002 without leaving a direct heir, throwing the empire into a succession crisis. On 15 February, a diet of feudal lords and knights in Pavia acclaimed Arduin King of Italy. According to the chronicler Arnulf of Milan,Arnulf, Liber gestorum recentium, I.14 Arduin was \\"elected by the Lombards in Pavia and was called 'caesar' [emperor] by all\\". He then made the rounds of the kingdom with the Archbishop of Milan publicly at his side. However, while Arduin had the loyalty of the minor nobles, that of the bigger landlords, more tied to the imperial power, was much more questionable, and opposition to his rule was instigated by the bishops, led by Frederick, Archbishop of Ravenna. In Germany, Henry II was acclaimed king on 7 June 1002, and he did not recognize Arduin's coronation. Henry granted the March of Verona to Duke Otto I of Carinthia, and then sent Otto to Italy to depose Arduin; but in the spring of 1003, Arduin defeated Otto in a pitched battle at Fabrica near the Brenta River. This was only the beginning. Henry personally invaded Italy with a large force that left Germany in March 1004 and arrived at Trento on 9 April 1004. He met Arduin outside Verona, where Arduin was disappointed by a poor showing from his erstwhile supporters. Henry entered Pavia, the traditional Lombard capital, and had himself crowned King of Italy on 14 May in San Michele in the face of a disapproving crowd. Then he burned the city that had given shelter to Arduin to the ground. This had its effect: \\"All of Italy was horrified by this and likewise extremely fearful. As confidence in Arduin waned from this time on, Henry's power prevailed everywhere.\\"Arnulf, Liber gestorum recentium, I.16 =King in the northwest= At this point, Henry was satisfied by his formal recognition as ruler of Italy and returned to Germany in the early summer of 1004. Arduin had withdrawn to his stronghold in the Orco Valley, and Henry chose not to pursue him with the main body of his army. Some imperial forces besieged the valley until the winter 1004-1005 but then withdrew; afterwards, Arduin rapidly regained control of all of his previous possessions. Arduin's rule lasted until 1014, when Henry descended into Italy again, this time to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Pope Benedict VIII. There were several skirmishes between Henry's army and Arduin's followers, both in Rome and as Henry began to withdraw back into Germany. But at that point the old king, probably sick and tired, chose to abdicate the Italian throne. He secured the possession of the main part of the March of Ivrea for his son Arduin II (the March was dissolved, but the younger Arduin was appointed Count of Ivrea), renounced all of his titles, and retired to the Benedectine Abbey of Fruttuaria, which he had founded in 1003. He died there on 14 December 1015. Coinage Arduin's coinage was designed to resemble that of Otto III as closely as possible. Unusually, the character ‚àÇ, a rounded minuscule D, was used in his name to make it resemble Otto's monogram. Two types of denarius, both minted at Pavia, are known for Arduin. The first bears the inscription AR‚àÇO +HINVS REGEM (Arduin king) on the obverse and +IHPERATOR (emperor) on the reverse. It is not clear if the latter is simply a holdover from Otto III's coinage or represents Arduin's anticipation of a future imperial coronation. The second type reads AR‚àÇO IN GRACIA DI REX (Arduin in the grace of God king) and PAPIA CIVITAS +GLORIO (Pavia glorious city). Arduin may have been able to mint coins in Pavia after Henry returned to Germany in 1004. There are no known coins of Henry II from the period before 1014, although coins of Otto III may have continued to be struck in the confusion.

High school career Dawson attended Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas and was a letterman in football. In a 1992 playoff game at Texas Stadium against Nacogdoches High School, Dawson kicked a 52-yard field goal as time expired to beat Nacogdoches 31-28. He graduated in the class of 1993; the Baltimore Ravens placekicker Matt Stover attended the same high school, graduating in 1986. As a senior, he was a starter at both kicker and offensive tackle until he hurt his knee in a preseason scrimmage. He thought he might have to have season-ending surgery, but he gutted it out, stuck to kicking, and was named as an All-American and the Southwest Region Offensive Player of the Year by SuperPrep. College career Dawson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year letterman in football. After redshirting his freshman year, he scored 80 points his first year of playing. He also tied a school record with 54 consecutive extra points. The following season, he made honorary All- America honors while leading the Longhorns in scoring. He made first-team All- America his junior and senior years, while simultaneously making All-Big 12. He earned a B.A. in political science. Dawson is famous for his 1995 game- winning field goal against the University of Virginia, booting a 50-yarder against a 30-MPH wind to give Texas a dramatic 17-16 victory as time expired. Professional career Dawson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Oakland Raiders, who then waived him. He was picked up by the New England Patriots and assigned to the practice squad, but never appeared in a game for them. =Cleveland Browns= Dawson in 2011 The Cleveland Browns signed him as a free agent in March 1999, and he remained with the team for 14 years until he joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2013. (He was the only player left from the 1999 Browns squad). Dawson holds the Browns record for most consecutive field goals made (29) and most field goals in a game (6). Dawson is currently the 7th most accurate kicker in the NFL. On October 10, 2010, Dawson tied Lou Groza for the Browns' career field-goal record with 234. Dawson scored the first points in the history of the \\"new\\" Cleveland Browns in 1999. On October 10 of that year, he scored the only touchdown of his career on a fake field goal against the Bengals in an 18-17 loss. On November 17, 2008, Dawson hit a 56-yard field game-winning field goal against the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football. Dawson would have become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2010 season, but he was given the franchise tag on February 22, keeping him for the 2011 season. =San Francisco 49ers= Dawson in 2014 Dawson signed with the San Francisco 49ers on March 19, 2013. He made a career record 27 consecutive field goals during the 2013 season, until the streak was snapped by a 24-yard field goal miss against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17. He finished his first year in San Francisco with the second-most points (140) and field goals (32-of-36) in the team's history. Dawson kicked the game- winning field goal in the 49ers Wild Card playoff game against the Green Bay Packers on January 5, 2014, giving the 49ers a 23-20 victory. On September 26, 2013, Dawson attempted and missed a 71-yard fair catch kick in the last seconds of the second quarter of a game against the St. Louis Rams. On March 11, 2014, Dawson signed a new two-year contract to remain with the 49ers. Dawson re-signed with the 49ers on a one-year contract on March 12, 2016. He made his 400th career field goal on November 20, 2016 against the Patriots. =Arizona Cardinals= On March 10, 2017, Dawson signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals. On September 10, 2017, in the season opening 35‚Äì23 loss to the Detroit Lions, Dawson made his debut as a Cardinal. He converted two extra points and a field goal in the loss. On September 17, 2017, Dawson converted three field goals, including a 40-yarder to force overtime and a 30-yarder in overtime to win, in the 16‚Äì13 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. On November 26, 2017, Dawson hit a 57-yard field goal with one second left to beat the favored Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the longest made field goal of Dawson's career (although he made a 59-yard field goal during a 2010 preseason game with the Browns). He converted four field goals in the game, including the 57-yard game-winner, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Dawson became the 11th player in NFL history to appear in 300 career games. On November 26, 2018, Dawson was placed on injured reserve with a hip injury. = Retirement = Dawson announced his retirement after 21 seasons on August 1, 2019, after signing a one-day ceremonial contract with the Browns to retire as a member of the team. After Dawson‚Äôs retirement, Adam Vinatieri became the sole remaining active player from the 1990s. The \\"Phil Dawson Rule\\" Dawson had a rule named after him after a missed call by referees. On November 18, 2007, Dawson attempted a 51-yard field goal in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter to tie the game against the Baltimore Ravens. The kick carried through the air and hit the left upright and then the rear curved support post (stanchion), which bounced the football over the crossbar and into the end zone, in front of the goalpost. The kick was originally ruled no good. Under NFL rules, the play was not reviewable.ESPN - Replay on all field goals probably a long shot - NFL Officials discussed the play among themselves for several minutes and decided that, since the ball had indeed crossed the crossbar within the goal, whatever happened afterward to the ball did not matter. The kick was considered good, as announced by referee Pete Morelli. However, as the play is not technically reviewable, referee Pete Morelli announced that the play was reversed \\"after discussion,\\" as opposed to \\"after further review,\\" as is usually stated. At this point the Ravens, already celebrating in the locker room (they would have won 30-27 if the field goal was no good), were called back out onto the field to proceed to an overtime period. The Browns went on to win the game, 33-30 in overtime, as Dawson came through again with a more visible 33-yard field goal. Dawson finished 4 for 5 in FGs whereas fellow Lake Highlands High School alumnus Matt Stover finished 3 for 3 in FGs for the Ravens.Box Score Notably, later in the season on December 16, in driving snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph, Dawson kicked another field goal, an improbable 49-yarder, that hit the same center support post. This field goal helped the Browns achieve an 8-0 win over the Buffalo Bills in blizzard conditions. Hitting this same structure twice in the same season has led some members of the Cleveland press to begin referring to the support post as \\"The Dawson Bar.\\"http://halftimeadjustments.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/the-dawson-bar/ Prior to the 2008 season, the rule was changed to allow field goal and extra point attempts that hit the uprights or crossbar to be reviewed. This new rule is dubbed the \\"Phil Dawson Rule.\\" Personal life Dawson resides in Austin, Texashttp://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2012/01/cleveland_browns_facing_five_i.html with his wife, Shannon, and 3 kids, Dru, Beau, and Sophiann. As of 2018, Dru is the starting varsity QB at Vandegrift High School as a junior while other son Beau is also on the varsity as a freshman backup. Dawson kicks right- footed but throws left-handed. His wife Shannon is a singer-songwriter and produced her first album \\"Redemption\\" in 2013. On March 6, 2020, Dawson was named Special Teams Coordinator at Lipscomb Academy in Nashville, TN.

The season officially began on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; in both basins, it ended on November 30\\\\. These dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone of the season, Hurricane Adrian, developed on June 18, while the final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Irwin, dissipated on October 11\\\\. No storms developed in the Central Pacific during the season. However, two storms from the Eastern Pacific, Dora and Eugene, entered the basin, with the former entering as a hurricane. The season produced fourteen tropical cyclones and nine named storms, which was well below the average of sixteen named storms per season; this was largely due to a strong La Ni√±a taking over much of the Pacific. However, the total of six hurricanes and two major hurricanes during the season was near the averages of eight and three, respectively. Although it remained offshore, Hurricane Adrian caused 6 deaths from flooding and rough surf in Mexico. Hurricane Dora was a long-lived and intense cyclone, which had the second longest track of a Pacific hurricane on record. The storm brought minor impacts to the island of Hawaii; however, no deaths or damage was reported. The deadliest tropical cyclone, Hurricane Greg, killed 10 people from flooding in Mexico.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The 1999 Pacific hurricane season was well below average, due to the strong La Ni√±a that was occurring at the time, which causes wind shear to be increased and water temperatures to decrease, resulting in conditions less conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 14 cyclones in total, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 9 became a tropical storm, while 6 reached hurricane status. Further, 2 of these became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Tropical cyclogenesis began with Hurricane Adrian, which developed on June 18\\\\. Although it remained offshore, Adrian brought rough surf and flooding to Mexico, which resulted in 6 fatalities. The storm peaked as a Category 2 before dissipating on June 22\\\\. No other tropical cyclones formed in June. Activity halted until July 9, when Hurricane Beatriz developed. Though it peaked as a Category 3 hurricane before dissipating on July 17, the storm caused no damage on land because it remained well offshore. The next system, a short-lived Tropical Depression Three-E, did not result in impact as a tropical cyclone, though the precursor brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to Central America. Tropical Depression Four-E, was the first of three cyclones to cross into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, which is between 140¬∞W and the International Date Line. Two other short-lived system in July, Tropical Storm Calvin and Tropical Depression Six-E, caused no damage. In August, Hurricane Dora, the strongest storm of the 1999 Pacific hurricane season, produced gusty winds and large waves on Johnston Atoll and the island of Hawaii, though minimal damage was left in its wake. After crossing the International Date Line on August 20, Dora became the first tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the North Pacific - Eastern, Central, and Western - since Hurricane John in 1994. Hurricane Eugene also existed in the Eastern and Central Pacific, but dissipated on August 15 while south of the main Hawaiian Islands, well before reaching the International Date Line. Nonetheless, it produced up to of rainfall on the Big Island of Hawaii. In the remainder of August, there was a series of short-lived tropical cyclones that did not effect land, including Tropical Depression Nine-E, Tropical Storm Fernanda, and Tropical Depression Eleven-E. During the month of September, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season, Hurricane Greg, was spawned near the Pacific coast of Mexico. Greg which killed 10 people when it made landfall on southern Baja California. The hurricane and its precursor produced heavy rainfall across much of Mexico, with the highest total reaching 22.23 in (566.9 mm). The heavy rains damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes. The remnant moisture from the system, combined with an area of low pressure, resulted in strong thunderstorms across California, which led to numerous power outages, damage to homes and vehicles, and started many wildfires. The other in the month of September was Hurricane Hilary, a storm that approached Baja California, but dissipated offshore on September 21, resulting in no impact. The final system, Tropical Storm Irwin, produced scattered areas of heavy rainfall over Mexico in October, but caused no significant flooding. It dissipated on October 11, over a month and a half before the official end of the season on November 30. In addition to the systems observed by the CPHC and NHC, a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on August 19, and quickly exited CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database. Systems =Hurricane Adrian= A broad area of low pressure developed into Tropical Depression One at 0600 UTC on June 18, while situated 290 miles (465 km) southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero. Moving towards west-northwestward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian about 12 hours later. Favorable levels of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures (SST's) caused the storm to strengthen further. Early on June 20 Adrian intensified into a hurricane, while located about 420 miles (680 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. About 24 hours later, Adrian reached its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 973 mbar (28.73 inHg). After reaching peak intensity on June 21, Adrian began weakening due to colder SST's and higher wind shear. Adrian fell to tropical storm status late on June 21, and further weakened to a tropical depression on June 22\\\\. Six hours later at 1800 UTC, Adrian degenerated into a swirl of low clouds while situated 300 mi (480 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Heavy rainfall produced from the storm caused minor flooding throughout Mexico. Two fatalities were directly attributed to the floods, while another person was listed as missing. Four other people were killed when they drowned in rough seas produced offshore the Mexican coastline. There is no damage estimate from the heavy rainfall or rough seas associated with the hurricane. =Hurricane Beatriz= A tropical wave developed into by 0600 UTC on July 9, while situated roughly 300 mi (480 km) south of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Mexico. At this time, the depression was in an environment of strong upper-tropospheric outflow, resulting in gradual intensification. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beatriz at 1200 UTC on July 9\\\\. Steady strengthened continued and about 48 hours later, Beatriz became a Category 1 while situated roughly 560 miles (900 km) south- southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Moving westward around the southern periphery of a ridge to the north, it continued to intensify. A well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery early on July 12\\\\. Microwave imagery a few hours later revealed that Beatriz was likely undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and was complete by 1700 UTC. Further intensification occurred, and Beatriz became the first major hurricane of the season at 1800 UTC on July 12\\\\. At 0600 UTC the following day, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955 mbar (28.20 inHg) while situated roughly 800 miles (1300 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Curving towards the west-northwest, Beatriz began to encounter an area of cooler sea surface temperatures, which led to gradual weakening. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 16, and further to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC that day. At 0600 UTC on July 17, Beatriz degenerated into a swirl of clouds. =Tropical Depression Three-E= A tropical wave moved across the Atlantic and Caribbean in early July. While crossing Central America on July 11 and July 12, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, especially in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico, where precipitation reached in Coyutla, Veracruz. By July 13, the wave and associated low pressure area emerged into the Pacific Ocean. The system organized further and developed into Tropical Depression Three-E at 1200 UTC on July 14, while located about west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. It initially headed west-northwestward until July 15, when it curved west- southwestward. The depression failed to strengthen further and dissipated at 1800 UTC on July 15, while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. =Tropical Depression Four-E= On July 15, a tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. Over the following days, slow organization occurred, and it is estimated that the system became developed into Tropical Depression Four-E at 0000 UTC on July 23\\\\. Later that day, the depression reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1007 mbar (29.74 inHg), having failed to reach tropical storm status. While moving westward, the depression entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on July 24. By this time, however, the depression was already becoming disorganized and dissipated early on the following day. =Tropical Storm Calvin= A tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea between early and mid-July. Later in the month, the wave acquired a low-level circulation. Thus, Tropical Depression Five-E developed at 0600 UTC on July 25, while situated about south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Due to further organization on satellite imagery, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Calvin six hours later. However, wind shear exposed the low-level circulation and halted intensification. Calvin continued west-northwestward as a sheared cyclone. According to satellite classifications, it is estimated that Calvin weakened back to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on July 26\\\\. There was a convective burst late on July 26, though the storm did not re-strengthen. Around that time, Calvin turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric trough. The burst in convection did not persist and the depression dissipated by 1200 UTC on July 27, while located well west-southwest of Baja California. A low-cloud swirl remained and subsequently continued on a west-northwesterly course for a few days. =Tropical Depression Six-E= A tropical wave that previously crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea reached the eastern Pacific basin until late July. The system developed a surface circulation on July 26, while microwave imagery data indicated wind speeds of . As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Six-E developed at 1800 UTC, while located nearly west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California and about southwest of Tropical Depression Calvin. The depression moved toward the west-northwest and encountered strong vertical wind-shear. Despite a few convective bursts, the depression remained weak and degenerated into a swirl of low clouds at 0000 UTC on July 28. =Hurricane Dora= A tropical wave moved off Africa on July 23 and crossed the Atlantic Ocean without development. However, the wave quickly increased in organization after entering the Eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4, and was designated Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6\\\\. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dora later that day. Dora continued to intensify despite upper-level wind shear, and became a hurricane on August 8\\\\. Shortly after, the hurricane moved westward into a more favorable environment and began to intensify more quickly, reaching Category 4 strength on August 10. It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved almost due west. Dora weakened to Category 1 strength as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 14\\\\. However, it briefly restrengthened into a Category 3 as it passed south of Hawaii on August 16\\\\. Dora then began weakening for the final time as it passed south of Johnston Atoll on August 18. At the atoll, Dora produced large waves and wind gusts between 40 and 45 mph (75 and 85 km/h). In Hawaii, heavy surf on the Big Island forced the closure of beaches, campsites, and hiking trails in the districts of Kau and Puna. On August 20, Dora crossed the International Date Line, shortly before weakening to a tropical storm. Due to vertical wind shear, it did not re-strengthen in the western Pacific basin. The storm weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity early on August 22\\\\. Dora dissipated late on the following day, while situated several hundred miles east of Wake Island. =Hurricane Eugene= A tropical wave crossed Central America between July 28 and July 29, before entering the Pacific Ocean and slowly organizing. After the cloud pattern consolidated, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Eight-E developed at 0600 UTC on August 6, while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Twelve hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene. It continued to deepen, reaching hurricane status late on August 8\\\\. About 24 hours later, Eugene peaked as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). The storm began to weaken and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane early on August 11. Eugene continued westward, and on August 11, it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. It continued to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 13\\\\. Eugene passed south of the Hawaiian Islands on August 14, with minimal impact noted. Minor surf occurred along the east and southeast shores of the Big Island. Additionally, 24‚Äëhour rainfall totals over windward sections of Maui and the Big Island were near . The storm weakened to a tropical depression by late on August 14\\\\. At 0000 UTC on August 16, Eugene dissipated while located about southeast of Johnston Atoll. =Tropical Depression Nine-E= A tropical wave moved off the African coast on July 27 and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 6\\\\. The system continued westward without development until August 11, when convection began to increase. By 1200 UTC on August 13, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Nine-E. Due easterly wind shear, the depression did not further intensify as it moved on a generally west-northwesterly track. The depression had dissipated by August 15. =Tropical Storm Fernanda= A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E at 0600 UTC on August 17, while located about in south- southwest of Socorro Island, Mexico. The depression intensified gradually due to favorable conditions. At 0000 UTC on August 18, the cyclone was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fernanda while centered about southwest of Socorro Island. The storm continued to slowly strengthened and 1200 UTC on August 19, Fernanda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Around the time of peak intensity on August 19, Fernanda curved west-southwest track, a motion which persisted for the remainder of its duration. While this track carried the storm over warmer SST's, increasing easterly wind shear caused Fernanda to weaken. By early on August 21, Fernanda weakened to a tropical depression. After weakening slightly further, the storm degenerated into a remnant low cloud swirl at 0000 UTC on August 23\\\\. The remnants of Fernanda persisted until finally losing its identity about west-southwest of Socorro Island on August 28. =Tropical Depression Eleven-E= A tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 15 and formed a surface low pressure area south of Mexico on August 19\\\\. After consolidating and organizing somewhat, the system became Tropical Depression Eleven-E late on August 23\\\\. However, colder SST's caused convection to diminish almost immediately, while moving parallel to the southern coast of Baja California. as thunderstorm activity slowly decreased due to cool SST's. By 1200 UTC on August 24, the depression dissipated just west of the tip of Baja California, having lasted for less than 24 hours. The highest rainfall total reported in Mexico was at Los Cabos, Baja California Sur. =Hurricane Greg= The northern portion of a tropical wave in the Atlantic spawned Tropical Storm Emily, while the southern portion headed westward and crossed Central America between August 31 and September 1\\\\. Thereafter, the system emerged into the Pacific Ocean and began to organize. By 1200 UTC on September 5, Tropical Depression Twelve-E developed near Manzanillo, Mexico. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Greg. Further intensification occurred, and late on September 6, Greg was upgraded to a hurricane as winds reached 75 mph (120 km/h). However, Greg weakened to a tropical storm on September 7, while approaching Baja California. At 2100 UTC that day, it made landfall near Cabo San Lucas. The storm then curved westward and weakened over colder SST's, until dissipating on late September 9. Both Gerg and its predecessor disturbance brought heavy rain to much of Mexico. The highest report was of 22.23 inches (566.9 mm) in Tecom√°n, Colima. Precipitation from Greg caused flooding in the states of Colima, Michoac√°n, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco. It was most severe along the Los Mezcales River. The flooding killed ten people. In addition, 2,000 people were rendered homeless and 2,000 others were affected in some way. The remnants of Greg produced thunderstorms in California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, there was widespread power outages and isolated damage to houses and vehicles, as well as causing several small wildfires. Overall damage was relatively limited, however. =Hurricane Hilary= A tropical wave moved off the coast of western Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August 29\\\\. It continued to move westward through the tropical waters of the Atlantic into the Caribbean. It still remained a tropical wave as it moved over Central America and began to acquire more convection and organization, from September 10 through September 11\\\\. Visible satellite imagery showed low level circulation and more organized deep convection as it became a tropical depression on September 17, while located about south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The system strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary at 1200 UTC on September 18\\\\. Due to the development of an eye feature and large increase in deep convection, Hilary was upgraded to hurricane on September 20, while located about southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. However, later that day, Hilary weakened back to a tropical storm. The storm fell further to tropical depression status on September 21\\\\. Hours later, the storm degenerated into a swirl of low-level clouds, as it bypassed Baja California on September 21. =Tropical Storm Irwin= The southern portion of the tropical wave that previously spawned Tropical Depression Eleven in the Gulf of Mexico entered the Pacific Ocean in early October. After becoming better organized, the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E at 1200 UTC on October 8, while situated about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression initially moved slowly north-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Irwin about six hours later. After a strong mid-tropospheric ridge developed over northern Mexico, Irwin moved northwestward and remained offshore Mexico. Early on October 9, the center of the storm passed within about of the coastline between Manzanillo and Cabo Corrientes. The storm then curved west-northwestward and at 1800 UTC on October 9, Irwin attained peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Stable air and increasing wind shear caused Irwin to weaken and fall to tropical depression intensity early on October 11\\\\. About 12 hours later, the storm dissipated while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. While passing offshore, Irwin brought patches of heavy rainfall to some areas of Mexico, peaking at in Coahuayutla de Guerrero, Guerrero. Storm names The following names were used for named storms in the Pacific in 1999. This is the same list used in the 1993 season. No new names were used for the first time in the Pacific Basin. No storms were retired during the season, thus this same list was used again in the 2005 season. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Adrian * Beatriz * Calvin * Dora * Eugene * Fernanda * Greg * Hilary  * Irwin   *    * * } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140¬∞W and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1999 are shown below, however none of them were used. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  *  *  *  * } Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1999 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1999 USD.

Located below the auditorium is the Sokol Underground, where numerous concert promoters such as Hunt Industries host many rock and hip hop concerts. History Sokol Auditorium was built in 1926 at the corner of South 13th Street and Martha Street to house many of Omaha's Czech community‚Äôs social activities. Sokols were fraternal (and sororal) organizations founded in Bohemia to promote equality, harmony, and fraternity. As one of four in Omaha, the Sokol Auditorium was utilized for meetings by twenty-five Bohemian lodges as well as ethnic Italians and American groups. The hall also offered recreation classes for its members.Mead & Hunt, Inc. (2006) Reconnaissance Survey of Portions of South Central Omaha, Nebraska: Historic Buildings Survey. Nebraska State Historical Society. p. 6. Retrieved 6/17/07. The Sokol Auditorium in Omaha was one of many such buildings built as part of the Sokol movement. In 1862, a highly educated young intellectual, Dr. Miroslav Tyr≈° (1832-1884) founded Sokol. His goal was to develop physically strong and mentally alert citizens, and to instill in them a deep love for national freedom from volunteer exercise and discipline. Sokols have been prominent in the Olympic Games for many years. Sokol Omaha sent Phil Cahoy and James Hartung as members of the 1980 Olympic team; Hartung competed again in 1984. Legacy The Sokol Auditorium has been mentioned specifically in a number of songs from the last twenty years. The Faint mentions the Sokol in the song, \\"Amorous in Bauhaus Fashion,\\" from the album Media. They Might Be Giants wrote the song, \\"Sokol Auditorium,\\" about the venue. Neva Dinova's music video for \\"Yellow Datsun,\\" was filmed at the Auditorium, and Johnny Rioux of the Street Dogs collapsed on stage on February 27, 2007 of an apparent seizure while his band was opening for Flogging Molly.

He became a rubber and an early thermoplastics manufacturer. For over 20 years Spill had pursued the goal of making a successful business from Alexander Parkes' invention Parkesine, the first man- made plastic. Career Although he trained as a doctor he joined the business of his brother George. The firm of George Spill & Co. manufactured waterproof textiles in Stepney Green, East London Trade Card,Science Museum accessed 23 Dec 2007 by spreading rubber onto cloth. The material was much in demand for capes and groundsheets for soldiers in the wet conditions of the Crimean War. Spill became aware of Parkes' claim for the waterproof qualities of Parkesine probably at the 1862 exhibition.Plastic:the Making of a Synthetic Century, Stephen Fenichell (Harperbusiess,NY 1996) Negotiations led to an agreement not only to use it for waterproofing but also to develop Parkesine in the works of George Spill at Hackney Wick. A provisional patent was granted in 1863 to the Spill brothers and Thomas James Briggs concerning \\"improvements in the manufacture of driving straps or bands and of flexible tubes or hose\\"Newton's London Journal of Arts 1863 accessed 23 Dec 2007 In 1866, the Parkesine Company was established with Daniel Spill as works manager and Parkes as managing director. The Company did not prosper and was wound up in 1868, Spill taking over most of the stock. He formed the Xylonite Company in 1869 to carry on the business but that did not fare much better and was wound up in 1874. Undaunted by these failures, Spill established Daniel Spill & Co. in Homerton, continuing to make Xylonite and Ivoride. This enterprise succeeded in that others entered into an agreement with Spill in 1877 to form the British Xylonite Company in purpose-built premises at Brantham. This company did go on and prosper, going on to employ 1,160 people by 1902 and changed its name to BX Plastics. Spill's later years were largely occupied in a long legal battle in America with John Wesley Hyatt and the Celluloid Manufacturing Company for infringement of his patents. The lawsuit which was filed in 1875, was first found in his favour in 1880 even after Parkes testified on behalf of Hyatt, but reversed in 1884. Spill returned to England and in 1887 died of diabetes at the age of 55. Personal life He married at the age of 18; his bride was 15. In 1881 Spill was listed as a retired manufacturer in the 1881 census of Leyton High Street, living with his wife and daughter and his nephew George, an India Rubber Manufacturer.

It had six major hurricanes, which was well above average. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11, about ten days later than the normal start of the season. The final storm of the year, Hurricane Madeline, dissipated on October 20. Storm activity in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's warning zone was low, with just one tropical depression observed in the region. Two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific (Darby and Estelle) also entered the central Pacific; the former did so as a hurricane. The most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars. It later produced sporadic rainfall in the southwestern United States, leading to some traffic accidents. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms, all of which remained offshore. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala. Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to the southwestern United States, and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas.

However, the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three. Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ, which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico, making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures, hence limiting the number of storms that formed during the season. Although a semi-permanent anticyclone persisted through the summer of 1998, causing most of the storms to remain at sea, some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the anticyclone. Except for Hurricane Kay, all of the storms of the season originated from tropical waves. Accumulated Cyclone Energy is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of a storm multiplied by its duration, so longer-lived hurricanes have higher ACEs. The total ACE for the season was 133.97 √ó 104 kt2. Because several storms in 1998 were long-lasting or intense, the season's ACE was near-normal. Hurricane Howard had the highest ACE, measuring 29.27 x 104 kt2.  Systems  = Tropical Storm Agatha = A poorly defined tropical wave crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 8. As it tracked westward under the influence of a ridge to its north, a broad circulation developed. Gradually, the dominant center of circulation became better defined, with increasingly organized convection and developing banding features. By early on June 11, the center became sufficiently associated with the convection for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One-E. This occurred while the area of unsettled weather was about 460 miles (765 km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The center of the depression was not initially well defined, with restricted outflow in the eastern half of the circulation. As such, the depression failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its formation. Later, an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression, resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization. By June 13, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and gave it the name \\"Agatha\\". Agatha was about 650 miles (1050 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas when it became a tropical storm. As Agatha became a tropical storm, forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further, due to its forecast track passing over cooler waters. However, Agatha quickly strengthened, developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center, and early on June 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) while about 615 miles (985 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Agatha maintained peak winds for about 12 hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening. On June 15, it degenerated back into a tropical depression, and a day later, it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. The storm never affected land. = Tropical Depression Two-E = A few days later, another westward-moving tropical disturbance paralleled the southern coast of Central America and Mexico. Convection in the area organized steadily, and late on June 19, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E about 260 miles (420 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. On becoming a tropical depression, the system maintained a large, elongated, low-level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to wind shear. The National Hurricane Center first predicted that the depression would intensify, reaching winds of 50 mph (80 km/h), though two computer models projected it to quickly dissipate. Under the influence of a ridge over Mexico, the depression moved to the west-northwest, and, under the influence of increasing wind shear, the depression failed to organize significantly. By June 20, the circulation center was partially exposed, and was located to the northeast of the primary convection ‚Äì traits that signal a weak storm. Two-E approached tropical storm status, though deep convection waned after the system moved over cooler waters. On June 21, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the depression, stating that the depression maintained a very well-defined, low-level circulation, but had no convection associated with the system. Locally heavy rains fell across southwest Mexico in association with this system, peaking at at Las Gaviotas/Compostela. = Hurricane Blas = On June 8, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. The wave remained weak and nondescript as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 19. An area of convection developed and organized along the wave's axis, and the National Hurricane Center began to employ Dvorak classifications on June 20. Convective banding features increased as the broad circulation became better defined, and on June 22, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-E about 575 miles (925 km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Well-defined steering currents resulted in a general west- northwestward movement. Deep convection concentrated near the center, and about 12 hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Blas about 400 miles (640 km) south of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca. Tropical Storm Blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to the Mexican coast. Banding features increased, and on June 23 the storm attained hurricane status about 345 miles (555 km) southwest of Acapulco. The next day, an eye developed and became apparent on satellite imagery, while upper-level outflow became better defined. Blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on June 25, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), while about 575 miles (925 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Temperatures warmed in the convection around the eye, though the eye remained visible for several days as Blas turned west under the influence of a ridge to its north. On June 28, it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water. Blas weakened to a tropical depression on June 30, and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near the center. A remnant low-level cloud swirl persisted for several days, passing well to the south of Hawaii on July 5 before dissipating. The Associated Press attributed 4 deaths from a mudslide in Michoac√°n to Blas. However, as the primary convection remained offshore, the National Hurricane Center did not consider the deaths related to the hurricane. The threat of Blas prompted officials in Acapulco to close the port to all navigation. = Tropical Storm Celia = On July 1, another tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. It moved westward due to strong wind shear without further organization, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11. An area of organizing convection developed along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications began on July 13, while the tropical wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The cloud pattern soon became disorganized, and the area of disturbed weather continued west- northwestward. On July 16, convection increased and organized into banding features; early on July 17, the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E about 150 miles (240 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Soon after becoming a tropical depression, the storm rapidly organized and intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression. The tropical storm initially moved northwestward, and briefly threatened southern Baja California. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning on July 18 for La Paz southward. Shortly thereafter, a mid- to upper- level anticyclone turned Celia to the west-northwest and forced it to pass about 150 miles (240 km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. On July 19, Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 20, and Celia dissipated early on July 21, well away from the Mexican coastline. The precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along the south coast of Mexico. Authorities in Mexico closed the port at Acapulco to small fishing and recreational boats, and advised larger craft to use caution. Damage from the storm, if any, is unknown. = Hurricane Darby = A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 4. It tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with little increase in convection, and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on July 16. Three days later, convection began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of Acapulco, Mexico. On July 21, Dvorak classifications began as the cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images. Convective banding features gradually developed, and it is estimated that the system organized into Tropical Depression Five-E early on July 23 about 720 miles (1160 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Under the influence of a mid- to upper-level ridge to its north, the depression tracked west-northwestward. Convection became more concentrated as outflow organized further, and 18 hours after the depression first developed, it intensified into Tropical Storm Darby. Located in an area conducive to further development, Darby attained hurricane status on July 24, subsequent to the development of a 17-mile (27 km)-wide eye. The eye became more distinct while surrounded by an area of deep convection, and on July 25 the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) about 850 miles (1370 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The eye soon disappeared on satellite imagery, believed to be from an eyewall replacement cycle, and Darby's winds weakened to about 105 mph (170 km/h). A 25-mile (40 km) eye next developed, and on July 26, the hurricane re-intensified to reach peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). For a 30-hour period, Darby attained the characteristics of an annular hurricane, retaining a well-defined structure with few banding features for an extended period. The hurricane began to weaken while entering an area of cooler water and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, Darby weakened to a tropical storm on July 29. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 31, and early on August 1, Darby dissipated a moderate distance north of the Hawaiian Islands. It never affected land. = Hurricane Estelle = On July 18, a tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa, and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean with sporadic convection but no development. The wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico before crossing Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 28. Early on July 29, Dvorak classifications began on the system, and subsequent to the formation of banding features and a surface circulation, the system developed into Tropical Depression Six-E about 170 miles (275 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression continued to organize, with increasing convection and distinct upper-level outflow, and early on July 30 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle. Tropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion caused by a large anticyclone to its north. On July 31, the storm attained hurricane status about 550 miles (885 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Its intensification continued as a well-defined eye about 30 miles (48 km) in diameter became visible on satellite imagery, and on August 2 Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h). The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the eye disappeared on satellite imagery. Two days after peaking in intensity, Estelle weakened to tropical storm status. Late on August 4, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, and the next day the storm weakened to tropical depression status. Convection briefly re-developed on August 6, though increased wind shear and cooler water weakened the depression further. Two days later, Estelle dissipated about 400 miles (645 km) east-northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. High surf from Estelle impacted southern California, resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues. The storm disrupted the trade winds around Hawaii, resulting in light winds and rain showers on Kauai and Oahu. = Tropical Storm Frank = On July 19, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. A mid-level circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22, though the wave became less distinct as it continued westward. The wave axis crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31. Convection steadily increased, though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to organize. Dvorak classifications began on August 4, and subsequent to the formation of a low-level circulation the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 about 550 miles (885 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression tracked generally northward, under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid- level trough to its west. The center of the depression was initially elongated, with northerly wind shear impacting the structure of the cyclone. This at first prevented further strengthening, though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water. On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank, and it soon turned to the north-northwest, brushing the western coastline of Baja California. On August 9, Frank reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) about 105 miles (170 km) west-northwest of Ciudad Constituci√≥n. It turned to the northwest, with a portion of the circulation of the land, and steadily weakened after moving over cooler water. On August 10, Frank dissipated a short distance off Baja California. On August 8, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for portions of the southwestern Baja California Peninsula. Officials ordered the evacuation of some residents near Cabo San Lucas, whose port was closed, due to the threat of mudslides. Gusty winds and moderate rainfall were reported in a localized area of Baja California Sur, with rainfall peaking at 9.61 inches (244 mm) at Santa Anita, near Los Cabos. Moisture from Frank extended into the southwestern United States, producing more than 2 inches (50 mm) of rain in southern California and Arizona. One news agency attributed three deaths to the storm, though elsewhere there were no reports of damage. = Hurricane Georgette = A tropical wave was first observed in the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4 in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It tracked westward, and by August 9 a low-level circulation formed well to the south of Mexico. Banding features increased as the system detached from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and on August 11, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight-E about 730 miles (1170 km) southwest of Acapulco. On becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near the center. The National Hurricane Center initially predicted that the depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) within 72 hours. For much of the rest of the storm's duration, the National Hurricane Center underestimated the intensity of the cyclone. The depression tracked steadily northwestward, caused by its location along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. It would retain that direction for most of its remaining duration. Late on August 11, it intensified into Tropical Storm Georgette, and two days later it attained hurricane status after developing a 40-mile (65 km) eye about 615 miles (990 km) south- southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The eye became increasingly distinct while banding features became very well organized. Georgette attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) while centered 690 miles (1110 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The hurricane soon moved over cooler water, and began to weaken as convection warmed and decreased. On August 16, it degenerated into a tropical storm, and Georgette dissipated on August 17 without ever affecting land. = Tropical Depression One-C = An area of convection developed in association with a northward bulge of the near- equatorial convergence zone. It tracked west-northwestward under the influence of a ridge to its north, and organized into Tropical Depression One-C on August 19, about 1000 miles (1600 km) southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. The depression failed to organize significantly as it turned westward. High wind shear from an upper-level trough continually weakened the system, and on August 19, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on the tropical depression about 365 miles (585 km) south of Hilo on the island of Hawaii. It never affected land. = Hurricane Howard = A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 7. As it moved across the Atlantic Ocean, it failed to organize. On reaching the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 17, however, an area of convection developed along the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began the next day, and a broad center of circulation gradually formed. Convection was intermittent at first, though it gradually organized and persisted near the center, and on August 20, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Nine-E about south of Puerto Angel, Mexico. It tracked generally west-northwestward, developing more pronounced banding features, and on August 21, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard. The center of Howard became embedded within the deep convection, and the storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on the 21st. An eye developed as outflow organized further, and Howard began to rapidly intensify to reach peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) about 600 miles (965 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. At the time of its peak intensity, the eye was small and located within a very cold central dense overcast. Shortly after peaking in intensity, the eye of Hurricane Howard gradually became larger, resulting in a slight weakening trend. After weakening to winds of 125 mph (200 km/h), the eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles (50 km), and the structure of the hurricane transitioned into that of an annular hurricane, similar to that of Darby earlier in the season. Howard strengthened again into a Category 4 hurricane on August 25 before weakening slightly the following day. The hurricane retained annular characteristics for about 48 hours before moving over cooler water. On August 28, it weakened to a tropical storm, and early on August 30, Howard was considered to have dissipated. A small, low-level swirl of clouds devoid of convection persisted for a few days before dissipating. Howard never affected land. = Hurricane Isis = Isis developed on September 1 out of the interaction between a tropical wave and a large, low-level circulation to the southwest of Mexico. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California Peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California. Isis made landfall at Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa on September 3 and quickly lost its low-level circulation. The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the US state of Idaho. In Mexico, Isis destroyed more than 700 houses and killed 14 people, primarily due to heavy rainfall of more than 20 inches (500 mm) in southern Baja California Sur. The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways, stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States, resulting in light rainfall, dozens of traffic accidents, and power outages for thousands of residents in San Diego County. = Tropical Storm Javier = Javier is believed to have originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 22. A convective disturbance along the northern portion of the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Danielle on August 24, while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward. The wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic. On September 3, an area of convection began to develop near Acapulco, at the same time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation. The disturbance became better defined on September 5 as it tracked west-northwestward, and on September 6 the convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, while it was located about 200 miles (330 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Easterly wind shear initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern edge of the convection. The subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a general west-northwest motion, and the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Javier late on September 7. Banding features in the system did not organize significantly, and on September 8, Javier attained a peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h), which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over the center. Steering currents soon weakened, and the storm turned to the east while convection quickly decreased. By September 9, the center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection, and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression. On September 11, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on Javier, though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward. At times, it became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific, though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40 mph (65 km/h) indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on September 12. It turned to the northeast, and reached winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) before weakening due to waning convection. Javier made landfall about 35 miles (55 km) east-southeast of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco early on September 14, and dissipated within 12 hours of moving ashore. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along coastal areas of Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm. Javier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of Mexico, including a 24-hour peak of 7.36 inches (187 mm) in Colima, 6.69 inches (170 mm) in Michoac√°n, and 3.34 inches (85 mm) in Jalisco. Puerto Vallarta reported the highest total rainfall, at 17.33 inches (440 mm).Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (2007). Tropical Storm Javier. Retrieved on February 12, 2007. Damage, if any, is unknown. = Tropical Depression Twelve-E = A tropical disturbance developed persistent convection in association with a low-level circulation, and organized into Tropical Depression Twelve-E late on October 1 about 350 miles (565 km) west- northwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the depression was initially forecast to track slowly west- northwestward and reach winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), but instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to the west. The depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance. Early on October 2, two ships reported southwest winds much further to the north, with the National Hurricane Center indicating that either the center was exceedingly small, that no center existed at the time, or that the center was located far to the north of the thunderstorm activity. Operationally, the center was relocated further to the north, then relocated about to the south six hours later based on visible satellite images, then again relocated to the north, coinciding with officials issuing the last advisory on the system. By early October 3, the depression possessed only intermittent convection, and later that day it dissipated to the southwest of the Baja California peninsula. Heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across southwest Mexico, with a maximum total of at Las Gaviotas/Compostela. = Hurricane Kay = A small, low-level circulation separated itself from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on October 10, several hundred miles southwest of Baja California. The circulation was well defined, though its convection was initially minimal and disorganized. On October 12, the convection increased greatly, and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on October 13, about 715 miles (1150 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35 mph (55 km/h). Operationally, the depression was forecast to intensify to reach peak winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) while tracking steadily west-northwestward. The storm center was at first ill- defined, and post-season analysis estimates that it intensified into Tropical Storm Kay about 6 hours after developing. After becoming a tropical storm, Kay rapidly organized as it tracked generally westward. A pinhole eye developed in the center of the convection, and Kay attained hurricane status late on October 13, about 18 hours after developing. After remaining a hurricane for about 12 hours, the eye disappeared and the convection weakened, and early on October 14 Kay degenerated into a tropical storm. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the storm turned to the southwest, then to the south, after weakening to a tropical depression on October 15. Convection sporadically redeveloped, but failed to persist. Kay turned to the southeast and later to the east, and the system dissipated on October 17, about 330 miles (530 km) south-southwest of its origin. Kay never affected land. = Hurricane Lester = A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 29, and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America convection increased as it tracked northwestward, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 15, about 200 miles (320 km) south of Guatemala. It moved northwestward and late on the 15th it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester, about 115 miles (185 km/h) south of the border of Mexico and Guatemala, before attaining hurricane status on October 16. Lester continued westward and strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) on October 22. Late on October 23, it degenerated into a tropical storm, and several days later, Lester dissipated on October 26. Early in its lifetime, Lester produced heavy rainfall across southwestern Guatemala. The rainfall destroyed some houses and killed livestock, and a mudslide from the heavy precipitation killed two children. In Honduras, rainfall from the hurricane destroyed a bridge in Tegucigalpa, affecting about 1,000 people. Moisture brought around the northeast periphery of the Sierra Madre Occidental led to a narrow band of heavy rainfall along the upslope side of the mountain range, with a local precipitation maximum exceeding 14 inches (360 mm).Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (2007). Hurricane Lester. Retrieved on February 12, 2007. Though no surface reports are available, it is estimated that tropical-storm-force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern Mexico. = Hurricane Madeline = A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 25, and remained disorganized while crossing the Atlantic Ocean before crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean. It continued westward, and on October 15 began to steadily organize until developing into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 16, about 230 miles (370 km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. At the western end of a mid-level ridge, the depression tracked north-northwestward. 12 hours after first developing, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Madeline. Banding features gradually improved in organization, and late on October 17, Madeline attained hurricane status. On October 18, Madeline attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) about 95 miles (150 km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit. Late on October 19, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and early on October 20, Madeline dissipated in the southern portion of the Gulf of California. Some of the rainbands from Madeline moved over portions of southwest Mexico, with close to 9 inches (560 mm) falling at Cabo Corrientes.Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (2007). Hurricane Madeline. Retrieved on February 12, 2007. No damage or casualties were reported as a result of the storm in Mexico. Moisture from Madeline contributed to heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, reaching over 22 inches (560 mm) in some locations. Thirty-one people died due to the flooding, and damage totaled $750 million (1998 USD).  Storm names  The following names were used to name storms that formed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean during 1998.

Introduction The book is the result of five years of research by the authors, which also included several thousand interviews, and examination of a series of publicly available documents and relevant materials. These became the basic materials for presenting the story of the birth of the modern state of Israel. The book O Jerusalem! endeavors to present events from all sides who were parties to the conflict and the events which are the subject matter of the book: the Arabs, the Jews--from the simple soldiers and rabbinical students to the commanders like David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir--and the British. Presentation The book has forty-six chapters, grouped into four parts: *Part One: A Time to Mourn and a Time to Dance has six chapters. *Part Two: A House Against Itself has eleven chapters. *Part Three: A City Besieged has thirteen chapters. *Part Four: A City Divided has sixteen chapters. The book begins with a prologue, and ends with an epilogue, index, and certain relevant information categorized under biographical note acknowledgements, a bibliography, chapter notes, and photograph credits. Background information In 1917, during World War I, Britain defeated the Ottoman Turks and Palestine and Jordan were put under its control. They came under official British mandate in 1922 by League of Nations approval. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, named after British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, promised that Britain would assist the Jewish people in building their state in the Middle East (\\"Balfour Doctrine,\\" Britannica). However, Britain also promised to give the Palestinian Arabs independence in the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence. Britain denounced the Husayn-McMahon correspondence with the Churchill White Paper, declaring Britain's favor of the Balfour Doctrine over the Husayn-McMahon correspondence. The 1930 Passfield White Paper reversed this policy with its pro-Husayn-McMahon policy. This White Paper was met with outrage in the Jewish community and Britain quickly reverted its policies back to the 1922 Churchill White Paper. Arabs responded with a strike, followed by a revolt (lasting until 1939) in 1936. In 1939 Britain released the 1939 White Paper, which acceded to Arab demands. The White Paper promised an end to Jewish immigration, and independent Arab Palestine. The League of Nations and the Jews of Palestine rejected the White Paper as entirely outside Britain's mandate. After World War II Britain asked the United Nations to solve the Zion-Arab conflict. On November 29, 1947, the UN voted to partition the British mandate of Palestine to include a Jewish state as well as an Arab Palestinian state (\\"Palestine\\" Britannica). Synopsis The book begins immediately after the partition decision was announced. The Jews flooded the streets of Palestine, celebrating. However, the Jewish leaders immediately began planning for war. Ehud Avriel was sent to Prague to buy arms in the name of Ethiopia. Meanwhile, the Jews built an army and air force from scratch. The Jewish leaders, like David Ben-Gurion, knew that, due to military shortcomings, the conflict could only be won through intelligence warfare. The Arabs vowed to put Jerusalem under siege, and did. For many months Jerusalem survived on very limited foodstuffs. On the Arab side, Captain Abdul-Aziz Kerine bought arms in Prague in the name of Syria, the only sovereign Arab nation at the time. The Arab countries (Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Transjordan) discussed their plan of action. They agreed to work together, but everyone, especially King Abdullah of Transjordan, had their own agenda. In the end, the Arab states' lack of cooperation led to their downfall. There was a lot of disorganization and non-cooperation on the Jewish side as well. The main Jewish army was the Haganah; however, the Stern Gang and Irgun were other Jewish militant groups. The groups had conflicting ideals (for example: the Haganah was willing to internationalize Jerusalem in order to have a unified, peaceful state, but Jerusalem was of the utmost importance to the Stern Gang and the Irgun), but they managed to retain more organization and cooperation than the Arab armies. In the main text of O Jerusalem!, it is related that the Stern Gang and the Irgun massacred the Arab village of Deir Yassin, outraging Arabs. The Haganah denounced the massacre, but the Arabs believed the Haganah to be responsible and retaliated at the Jewish kibbutz of Kfar Etzion. As May 15 drew closer, the two peoples continued preparing for war. However, the Jewish intelligence learned that, although the mandate was set to expire on May 15, the British were planning to leave on May 14. Prepared for the early departure, the Haganah mobilized quickly and managed to capture many British buildings before the Arabs even realized that the British had left. Not privy to this intelligence, the Arab armies activated on May 15. The Jewish homeland of Israel was declared on Iyar 5, 5708 Hebrew, or May 14, 1948, Gregorian. Today, this day is celebrated as Yom Ha'atzmaut, or Israeli Independence Day. After the expiration of the mandate, war befell the region. The Arab armies underestimated the Haganah's strength and were not prepared for a strong foe. Both the Arab and Jewish armies suffered major shortcomings in ammunition and manpower. The situation in Jerusalem worsened, leaving Jewish Jerusalemites near starving. On June 11, 1948, a UN sanctioned cease-fire began. Jerusalem's starving were saved by a temporary end to the siege. Jerusalem's storerooms and stomachs were filled again. By cease-fire agreement, neither army was allowed to re-arm itself, but the Haganah was able to buy arms through the black market. The Arab armies, however, were not. After four weeks, the fighting began again, followed by another cease-fire beginning on July 19 (July 17 in Jerusalem), 1948 (O Jerusalem! Collins). Historical value The authors spent three years interviewing, researching, and reading public documents in order to create an interesting, readable account of the birth of Israel and the lives and deaths of the countless, often nameless, people involved. This perspective gives justice to some of the most compelling factors of the conflict. There are some omissions in their narrative such as the shooting of Thomas C. Wasson which occurred in Jerusalem on 20 May 1948. References *Collins, Larry and Lapierre, Dominique (1972): O Jerusalem!, Simon & Schuster, .

With hundreds of deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, this season was one of the costliest and deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons. This was due to the exceptionally strong 1997‚Äì98 El Ni√±o event. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Several storms impacted land. The first was Tropical Storm Andres which killed four people and left another two missing. In August, Tropical Storm Ignacio took an unusual path, and its extratropical remnants caused minor damage in the Pacific Northwest and California. Linda became the most intense east Pacific hurricane in recorded history, a record it maintained until it was surpassed by Hurricane Patricia in 2015. Although it never made landfall, it produced large surf in Southern California and as a result five people had to be rescued. Hurricane Nora caused flooding and damage in the Southwestern United States, while Olaf made two landfalls and caused eighteen deaths and several other people were reported missing. Hurricane Pauline killed several hundred people and caused record damage in southeastern Mexico. In addition, Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka originated in the region before crossing the International Date Line and causing significant damage in the western Pacific. There were also two Category 5 hurricanes: Linda and Guillermo. Activity in the season was above average. The season produced 17 named storms, which was a little above normal. The average number of named storms per year is 15. The 1997 season also had 9 hurricanes, compared to the average of 8. There were also 7 major hurricanes compared to the average of 4.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This season exceeded these boundaries appreciably, as Tropical Storm Paka formed December 2, and dissipated nineteen days later after crossing the International Dateline and then moved into the Western Pacific. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was fairly active, due to the strong El Ni√±o that was occurring at the time. El Ni√±o causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140¬∞W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific. The first hurricane of the year was Hurricane Dolores, and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique. Most months during the year had several storms, but no records were set for storms in any particular month. Linda became the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the basin at the time, but was surpassed by Hurricane Patricia in 2015. Activity in the central Pacific was also above average. Two tropical storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season. The National Hurricane Center uses Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. This season has a total of 17 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. The total ACE of this season is 160*104 kt2 in the east Pacific proper. This qualifies this season as above-normal. Systems =Tropical Storm Andres= Andres originated from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm status as a second circulation formed north- northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After a brief period of a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter. Among the casualties were two fishers who were reported missing. Andres caused power outages, flooding rivers, several car crashes, and damage to roughly ten homes. The highest rainfall report from Mexico was at Mazatan. Damage was noted in parts of Nicaragua. Andres also killed four people in Usulut√°n, El Salvador due to heavy flooding. =Tropical Storm Blanca= Tropical Depression Two-E formed from a broad area of low pressure on June 9. Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca. This system developed a good outflow, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). However, its circulation was not well-defined and a weakening trend began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression on June 12. It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated. Blanca briefly threatened land on June 10 as warnings and watches were established by the Mexican Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional. Shortly thereafter, a ridge of high pressure turned Blanca away from the coast. As Blanca moved just south of the Mexican coast, it dropped a total of of rainfall at Fincha Chayabe/Maragaritas. There were no major damage or casualties as Blanca's impact was generally minimal. =Tropical Depression Three-E= Tropical Depression Three-E formed June 21. Moving rapidly westward, it never strengthened and the winds of the depression soon decreased. It dissipated early on June 24. The depression never impacted land. =Tropical Storm Carlos= On June 22, showers increased associated with a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained for a couple of days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported. =Tropical Depression Five-E= On the afternoon of June 29, Tropical Depression Five-E formed. It erratically moved westward. On July 1, the depression weakened slightly, but quickly reintensified. It dissipated on July 4, without even threatening land. =Hurricane Dolores= In early July, shower activity increased in association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures lower than normal for a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed. Dolores continued to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores became the first hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125¬∞W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140¬∞W) while producing minimal shower activity. It dissipated on July 12. The hurricane was not a threat to any land. =Hurricane Enrique= The first major hurricane of the season originated from a broad area of low pressure on July 8 near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The thunderstorms gradually became more concentrated and a tropical depression formed on July 12. It strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later, and then began to rapidly intensify as convection increased further near the center. It became a hurricane on July 13. Enrique continued to steadily intensify and became a Category 2 hurricane on July 14. The next day, Enrique reached its peak intensity of and peak pressure 960 mbar (hPa) on July 14. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane outflow became asymmetrical and it began to weaken over cool waters. It weakened fairly quickly and was downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane on July 15. It then lost hurricane intensity later that day. On July 16 the winds had decreased further to . Enrique weakened into a depression the next day, and degenerated into a swirl of clouds shortly thereafter. The system never threatened land. =Hurricane Felicia= A large area of disturbed weather formed on July 13. It then organized into a depression south of Manzanillo, Colima, on July 14. Intensification was delayed by wind shear due to its proximity to Enrique for about two days. However, it became a tropical storm late July 15 as it moved west- northwestward. Continuing to intensify, an eye formed. Based on this, Felicia was upgraded into a hurricane on July 17. Its development was again halted by increased wind shear, and as such it leveled off in intensity. After the shear decreased, Felicia began to intensify and the hurricane's winds reached and its pressure fell to 948 mbar (hPa), making it a moderate low-end Category 4 hurricane. Shear increased for the third time, and then moved into cooler waters. It began to weaken as it moved west-northwest. On July 20, it lost major hurricane intensity. Shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm, it crossed 140¬∞W. A strong wind shear took toll on Felicia and it was downgraded into a tropical depression July 22. No damage or deaths were reported in wake of the hurricane. =Tropical Depression One-C= Tropical Depression One-C formed on July 26 from a disturbance that had been showing signs of organization for the past three days. It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of July 27, it dissipated due to strong wind shear caused by an upper-level trough. The system never impacted land, thus no damage was reported. =Hurricane Guillermo= A tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean on July 27. It organized into a depression July 30 and was named Tropical Storm Guillermo the next day. It quickly intensified, reaching hurricane status on August 1. Guillermo became a major hurricane August 2. It reached Category 4 intensity on August 3. Continuing to rapidly intensify, Guillermo attained Category 5 strength August 4. The tropical cyclone peak intensity was 919 mbar (hPa) and . Guillermo then weakened slowly, becoming a tropical storm August 8. It crossed 140¬∞W and entered the Central Pacific. It weakened to a depression late August 10, but restrengthened back into a storm 24 hours later when it encountered a small area of warmer water. It weakened to a depression for the second and final time August 15 and became an extratropical cyclone early the next day. The storm's remnants recurved over the far northern Pacific. They were tracked to a point west of Vancouver Island. The remnants persisted for a few more days and drifted south before being absorbed by a mid-latitude cyclone August 24 off the coast of California. =Tropical Storm Hilda= A tropical wave that had showed signs of development emerged into the East Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 10. Despite some wind shear, the depression managed to become a tropical storm late on August 11. Hilda reached its peak intensity as a moderate 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm the next day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, it gradually weakened due to increasing wind shear On August 14, shear weakened Hilda to a depression and the cyclone dissipated early the next morning. Hilda was no threat to land and caused no known damage or deaths. =Tropical Storm Ignacio= Tropical Storm Ignacio formed first as a depression in an area of disturbed weather on August 17. Twelve hours later, it organized into a tropical storm. Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio never intensified beyond 40 mph (65 km/h) and then was downgraded into a depression on August 18. It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours later. It was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo. Ignacio's remnants moved north, bringing gusty winds to California coastal waters before dissipating. Severe flooding was recorded along Highway 97 with a debris flow estimated at and deep. They caused rainfall as far north as the U.S. state of Washington. Thunderstorms caused power outages in central California. =Hurricane Jimena= During the third week of August, a tropical disturbance formed far from land. Although the system was located over warmer than average sea surface temperatures, the upper-level environment was initially unfavorable. However the environment gradually became more conducive for tropical cyclone formation and Tropical Depression Twelve-E formed August 25 from an area of disturbed weather in a rather easterly location. It became a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane on August 27. Intensification was rapid, with winds increasing from to in just 6 hours. Continuing to rapidly intensify, it reached its peak intensity as a low-end category 4 hurricane. After maintaining peak intensity for 30 hours, it moved north-northwest and encountered increasing wind shear which reduced its winds from to in just 24 hours. Jimena completely dissipated on August 30, not long after entering the Central Pacific Basin. Hurricane Jimena was of no threat to land. =Tropical Storm Oliwa= Tropical storm Oliwa began as a tropical disturbance that had meandered south of Johnston Atoll. It organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on September 2. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Oliwa (Hawaiian for Oliver) as it slowly moved towards the west. It crossed the dateline late on September 3 and entered the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Area of Responsibility.) In the Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclones are not renamed when they cross basin boundaries, so Oliwa kept its name. Oliwa passed south of Wake Island on September 6, where it caused heavy rains but no damage. On September 7, Oliwa started a period of rapid strengthening, becoming a typhoon on September 8 and a Super Typhoon eight hours later. Oliwa stayed at that intensity for over two days. While still a strong typhoon, Oliwa passed near the Northern Marianas Islands. It then started weakening as it curved towards Japan. It made landfall as a minimal typhoon September 16. It quickly dissipated later that same day. Typhoon Oliwa caused 12 fatalities and left 30,000 people homeless. Damage totaled to 4.36 billion yen ($50.1 million USD). =Tropical Storm Kevin= Tropical Storm Kevin, first displayed hints of development while located near Panama, and developed a well-defined circulation after emerging into the Pacific. It was classified as a tropical depression in the Pacific on September 3 while located south-south west of Baja California. Convection increased and the outflow of the storm became better defined. As such, it became a tropical storm on the morning of September 4. Gradually intensifying, it reached it peak intensity as a mid-level tropical storm on September 5. As it moved westbound, it maintained its intensity for 12 hours. The environment was unfavorable, and two days later, Kevin weakened to a depression when deep convection ceased. It dissipated early on September 7, having never posed a threat to land. =Hurricane Linda= A tropical disturbance formed on September 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E later that day. The cyclone moved northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on September 10. Linda then rapidly intensified, reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed. On September 12, Linda reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of ‚Äîmaking it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale‚Äîand a minimum pressure of 902 mbar (902 hPa), making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia surpassed it in 2015. However, Linda soon moved over cooler waters, and began to weaken, falling below hurricane intensity on September 16. It then slowly weakened and dissipated on September 17. Linda passed very near Socorro Island. In addition, early forecasts predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were not necessary for any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a jetty. Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California that destroyed or damaged 79 houses. =Tropical Storm Marty= An area of disturbed weather formed early on September 10. It became better organized two days later as convection increased, and then organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E late on September 12. Moving slowly in a westward direction, it strengthened into a tropical storm in the morning of September 14. Later that day, the system reached its peak intensity of . Meanwhile, the storm's forward speed slowed down even more, and it turned to the south. It then encountered an area of strong wind shear, and it weakened into a depression on September 15 as the center of circulation became displaced from the deep convection. The shear continued to weaken, and the tropical cyclone dissipated late on September 16. There were no deaths or damage. =Hurricane Nora= A large area of disturbed weather moved into the Pacific on September 12. It then organized into Tropical Depression Sixteen-E on September 16 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. Early on September 18, a poorly defined and ragged eye appeared on infrared imagery. Shortly thereafter, its winds reached . Nora eventually peaked at Category 4\\\\. It then encountered water temperature anomalies, and fluctuated in strength. Then, a trough pulled Nora northward and accelerated the storm. After weakening to a Category 1, Nora made landfall in northern Baja California and stayed a tropical storm as it entered the United States. At that time, however, most of the deep rest convection was displaced to the northeast. Nora dissipated over Arizona, but its remnants kept going north. Hurricane Nora was the first Pacific hurricane to bring gale-force winds to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. In Mexico, Nora produced high waves, flooding, and heavy damage. Many homes were destroyed. In the United States, rains were heavy, and damage amounted to several hundred million dollars. Several hundred people were rendered homeless, and there was wind and flood damage in Arizona. Nora killed two people in Mexico, and several indirect deaths were reported in California. =Tropical Storm Olaf= A tropical disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to a tropical storm several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. Olaf, as a tropical depression, moved westward, far out to sea. Operationally, Olaf was believed to have dissipated for six days. however, in the Tropical Cyclone Report, a report issued several months after the hurricane's duration, it was believed to have remained a tropical cyclone the entire time. After restrengthening slightly, Olaf moved southeast on October 5 due to the influence of Hurricane Pauline. Olaf then turned north, and on October 12 made a second landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, as a tropical depression. Olaf's surface circulation weakened, and its remnants moved back out to sea, but did not redevelop. Olaf resulted in some reports of damage and flooding in Mexico and Guatemala. During two time frames, from September 27 through October 2 and 10 through October 16, a total of of rainfall fell in association with Olaf in Soyalapa/Comaltepec. Several people were reported missing. Most of its damage was from its first landfall. Throughout southern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, flooding caused by Olaf was blamed for eighteen deaths. =Hurricane Pauline= On October 3, a distinct area of disturbed weather formed. It drifted eastbound, and a well- defined low pressure soon formed. It became Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on October 5. Early the next day it intensified into tropical Storm Pauline. An eye feature developed on October 7 and as such Pauline was upgraded into a hurricane. In a favorable environment, the cyclone rapidly intensified, reaching Category 4 intensity. After fluctuating in intensity, interaction with land weakened Pauline to a Category 2 by the time it made landfall on October 9. It accelerated to the northwest, and passed over a mountainous region. The mountains disrupted Pauline's circulation, and squeezed the moisture from the hurricane. Pauline dissipated on October 10 while over Jalisco. Hurricane Pauline was the deadliest storm of the season. Landslides and flooding caused by heavy rain caused tragic loss of life and left thousands homeless. There were at least 230 casualties. The Red Cross reported that 400 people died, but this was disputed by Mexican officials. Pauline was Mexico's deadliest hurricane since 1976's Liza. In addition, the hurricane caused $447.8 million in damage (1997 USD; $473 million 2008 USD).Estad√≠sticas sobre los Riesgos a atenuar de Fen√≥menos Perturbadores =Tropical Depression Three-C= A tropical disturbance formed near 140¬∞W. It became Tropical Depression Three-C on October 6. The waters were very warm, and there was only moderate wind shear. However, the depression slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day. =Tropical Depression Four-C= A tropical disturbance formed in late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well southwest of Hawaii. Although the waters were very warm, some dry air was located north of the system. It slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day as the circulation became exposed. =Hurricane Rick= The first hurricane in November since 1991 formed from a tropical disturbance. Although the circulation was initially poorly defined, it later acquired enough organization and was classified as a tropical depression on November 7. It moved north until a trough of low pressure turned it to the northeast. It was named on November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) and 973 mbar (hPa). Rick made landfall in Oaxaca ‚Äì the same area devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier ‚Äì and quickly weakened, dissipating early on November 11. The storm downed trees, washed out recently repaired roads, and disrupted communications in some small population centers. A total of of rain was reported at Astata/San Pedro Huameluca near the point of landfall in Mexico. No one was killed. Rick is one of only eight known hurricanes to form in the Pacific Ocean east of the dateline in the month of November. The other ones are Nina, Tara, Iwa, Nora, Sergio, Kenneth, and Sandra of which only Rick, Tara, and Iwa directly impacted land. It was also the second-latest landfalling Pacific hurricane. =Tropical Storm Paka= Tropical Depression Five-C formed on December 2, two days after the season ended. It was the second December tropical depression east of the dateline; 1983's Hurricane Winnie was the only other one. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paka (Hawaiian for Pat) while west of Palmyra Atoll. The system began to move westward at a steady pace. As Paka moved westward, dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on December 6. After entering the Western Pacific, the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment, resulting in rapid intensification. It became a typhoon on December 10 and passed near Kwajalein with winds of . It strengthened further, twice reaching Category 5 intensity. While a super typhoon, Paka passed close to Guam on December 17, causing major damage. Afterwards, Paka encountered a hostile environment and had completely dissipated by the evening of December 22. Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1997 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1997 USD. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1997. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2003 season. This is the same list used for the 1991 season except for Felicia, which replaced Fefa. A storm was named Felicia for the first time in 1997. Also, the name \\"Dolores\\" was misspelled \\"Delores\\" in the 1991 season; in this and subsequent seasons, the typo was corrected. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Andres * Blanca * Carlos * Dolores * Enrique * Felicia * Guillermo * Hilda  * Ignacio * Jimena * Kevin * Linda * Marty * Nora * Olaf * Pauline  * Rick   * } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.

It was a below average season that produced 9 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. It officially began May 15, 1996, in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1, 1996, in the central north Pacific. It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season slightly exceeded these bounds when tropical storm One-E formed on May 13. Few storms formed this season, but it was very eventful. Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.

In the eastern north Pacific, eleven tropical cyclones formed. Of these, four became hurricanes, one of which were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The remainder were tropical storms. In addition, one Atlantic hurricane, Hurricane Cesar, crossed into this zone from the Atlantic Ocean and was renamed Douglas. None of the systems in the eastern north Pacific crossed 140¬∞W and entered the central Pacific. The last time that happened was in the 1979 season. In the central north Pacific, one tropical depression formed. In addition, a depression crossed the dateline from the western Pacific before dissipating in this basin. None of these two systems reached tropical storm strength. In addition, data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on September 1 Tropical Depression Rick crossed the International Dateline, entering into CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database. The storm eventually became extratropical on September 3 over open waters. In terms of the number of storms, the season was below average. Despite this, there were a large number of landfalls. Of note is the fact that three tropical cyclones approached close to, or made landfall on, Mexico during a ten-day span from June 23 to July 3. In all, a record-setting four hurricanes (Alma, Boris, Fausto, and Hernan) struck the coastline. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of how active a season is. It is found by taking a tropical storm or hurricane's windspeed in knots every six hours, squaring it, adding up the results, and dividing the total by 104. The ACE of this season makes it a below-normal season. It is one of the lowest totals ever recorded, with only the 2007, 1977 and 2010 seasons had lower totals. Systems =Tropical Storm One-E= The season had an early start on May 13 when a tropical wave in the open ocean organized into Tropical Depression One-E. The depression moved west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on May 14. On that day, the tropical storm reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds at and a minimum central pressure of . Wind shear steadily weakened the cyclone until it dissipated early on May 17. This system was the only tropical storm to form in May during the period from 1992‚Äì99. Tropical Storm One-E was not assigned a name because it was determined to be a tropical storm after the season was over. The storm was initially forecast to become a tropical storm, but information available at the time did not warrant the upgrade. Subsequently, wind reports relayed from the US Coast Guard to the National Hurricane Center suggested that this cyclone was a tropical storm. This tropical cyclone impacted two ships. The first ‚Äî called the True Blue ‚Äî was near the fringes of the storm and escaped. The other ‚Äî the trimaran Solar Wind ‚Äî provided wind observations until communications with the vessel were lost after 0600 UTC on May 14. Despite a search by the US Coast Guard, the ship and its two-person crew were never found. =Tropical Depression Two-E= On May 15 an area of disturbed weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into a tropical depression. The disturbance was not readily traceable back to a tropical wave from the Atlantic. On its first day of its existence, Tropical Depression Two-E was a well-organized system with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . As it slowly moved west, Two-E experienced a few intermittent bursts of convection. However, the depression gradually became less organized during the remainder of its life. On May 18, the cyclone's organization deteriorated markedly until it dissipated the next morning. Tropical Depression Two-E never threatened land. Consequently, there were no reports of deaths or damage. =Hurricane Alma= On June 20, the southern part of the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic overcame shear to strengthen into Tropical Depression Three-E. It reached tropical storm intensity that same day. When the shear relaxed, Alma strengthened into a hurricane. Weak steering currents sent Alma towards the Mexican coast. It made landfall near L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n on June 23 and almost immediately went back out to sea. Alma slowly paralleled the coast as the topography disrupted the cyclone's circulation. Alma weakened to tropical storm intensity on June 24 and to tropical depression intensity on June 26. It dissipated the next day. Alma's maximum winds were 105 mph (165 km/h) and Alma's minimum pressure was . Hurricane Alma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to, or make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. At least three, and possibly twenty, people were killed. Three were killed when a house near L√°zaro C√°rdenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in the state of Puebla caused by Alma's rains. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with debris throughout the affected area. =Hurricane Boris= On June 27, a tropical wave developed convection and became Tropical Depression Four. It moved north and slowly intensified. The rate of intensification increased and the depression became a tropical storm on June 28. Boris reached hurricane intensity on June 28 and peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a central pressure of . Boris then made landfall on June 29 about midway between L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Acapulco. Boris then moved offshore after turning to the southwest and dissipated on July 1 while south of Puerto Vallarta. Hurricane Boris was, in general, a well-forecast storm. Due to the short time when the system was at or above tropical storm intensity, long-range forecasts were not verified. The average errors were at one and a half days in the future. Boris caused at least five deaths. One person was killed in Tecpan. Nearby, three other people drowned and five fishers were missing. In Acapulco, a child was killed when a roof collapsed. Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region, with the highest totals in Guerrero. The highest total was at Paso de San Antonio, to the east of the point of landfall. =Tropical Storm Cristina= On July 1, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Five-E. The location of the depression was the easternmost since the depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul in the 1982 season. Five-E strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristina on July 2 as it continued its west- northwest track. Cristina was almost a hurricane at the time of its landfall near Puerto Angel on July 3. It peak strength, which occurred at landfall, was and . Cristina dissipated over the mountains of Mexico on July 3. As a whole, both Cristina's intensity and track were well-forecast. However, the tropical cyclone's short life made verification of a small number of forecasts limited. When Cristina was approaching, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm warning for the coast between Tapachula and Punta Maldonado on July 2. Tropical Storm Cristina killed one person, a fisherman, who was aboard a boat caught at sea. Another person from that boat was missing, and a third individual was rescued. Eleven other fishing boats, with a total of twenty-two people aboard, were missing. Their fate is unknown. The National Hurricane Center received no reports of damage due to Tropical Storm Cristina; however, there was flooding due to storm surge and damage from wind. It also produced rain. =Tropical Depression Six-E= On July 4, a persistent area of thunderstorms organized into a tropical depression. Weak steering currents slowly moved it northwest. Easterly wind shear inhibited the development of the system. Despite the wind shear, Six-E was forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm, but it instead weakened to a swirl of clouds and advisories were ended on July 5. Tropical Depression Six-E dissipated on July 6. At its peak strength, Six-E had winds of and a central pressure of . This cyclone never came ashore. Consequently, no reports of damage or deaths were received by the National Hurricane Center. =Hurricane Douglas= Hurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar, which crossed Central America. Continuing Cesar's nearly due-west heading, it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29, and quickly regained hurricane status. Douglas strengthened over the next two days as it turned west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. It reached its peak intensity on August 1, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane of the season at a Category 4 strength. It slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters, and it officially dissipated on August 6, though like many Pacific hurricanes, a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward. Compared with the long-term average, Hurricane Douglas was a well-forecast storm. The cyclone passed close enough to Mexico to necessitate a tropical storm warning starting on July 29 for the coast from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, with a watch along a further section of coast. The watches and warnings were discontinued on July 30. Hurricane Douglas brought up to 6 in (150 mm) of rain on the south coast of Mexico and resulted in a 4-ft (1.2-m) storm surge. No deaths or damages were attributed to the Douglas portion of Hurricane Cesar-Douglas. =Tropical Depression Seventeen-W= A tropical depression, which formed August 13 from a cutoff area of low pressure area, crossed the dateline on August 14. It continued to head east, passing close to Midway Island. It dissipated on August 14, although the remnants of the system hung around the area for a few more days. At its strongest in the central north Pacific, Tropical Depression Seventeen-W had winds of and a pressure of . Seventeen-W brought light winds, with gusts reaching gale-force, to Midway Island. It also brought about 2.5 in (63.5 mm) of rain. After the cyclone dissipated, showers and gusty winds continued to occur on Midway and Kure for a few more days. Seventeen-W was the first tropical cyclone to cross the international dateline in either direction since Typhoon John in the 1994 season. =Tropical Depression Dolly= Hurricane Dolly struck eastern Mexico and managed to hold together, remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean late on August 24. Although Tropical Depression Dolly entered the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center did not re-classify the system. No re- intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern Pacific, and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day, about 40 mi (65 km) west of San Juanito in the Islas Mar√≠as. =Tropical Storm Elida= A tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 30. The cyclone paralleled the coast of Mexico and also gradually decelerated. Despite some wind shear, Eight-E strengthened into a tropical storm on September 2 and was named Elida. On September 3 and 4, Elida came close to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula at its peak intensity of and winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The cyclone then drifted into cooler waters, was devoid of deep convection on September 5, and dissipated the next day. The storm was forecast slightly better than the long-term averages for the eastern North Pacific. Elida posed enough of a threat to the Baja California Peninsula to require a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula south of Cabo San L√°zaro on September 3. The warning was lifted on September 5 after the threat ended. Moderate to heavy rains fell in association with the tropical cyclone across southwest Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula, with the maxima falling at San Marcos/Compostela in southwest mainland Mexico, which measured , and a maximum for Baja California of at La Poza Honda/Comondu. While passing offshore, the tropical storm killed six people and affected 1,200 others, but Elida caused no known damage. =Hurricane Fausto= The precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31, and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran. By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific; it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10. Fausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the September 12, peaking with sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 955 mb. The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm; this same trough also turned the storm north on the September 13, where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane on Baja California that day. On September 14, the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California, and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane. Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas, but otherwise soon lost their identity. Heavy rainfall was accompanied with the passage of this cyclone, with a storm total of 18.50 inches (470 mm) reported at San Vicente de la Sierra. Damage in Mexico was relatively minor, with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line. Damage totaled to around $800,000 (1996 USD). =Tropical Depression One-C= A tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression on September 15. It headed west until September 17. That day, it turned to the west for two days before heading back west-northwest on September 19. It soon began to weaken and dissipated the next day. At its most intense, Tropical Depression One-C had winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and unknown pressure. The tropical cyclone caused no known impact and never came near land. =Tropical Storm Genevieve= In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, an area of disturbed weather containing convection formed on September 23. It moved westward without incident until September 27, when it developed stronger convection and became Tropical Depression Ten-E. Immediately thereafter, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Genevieve while it continued its westward track. Genevieve slowly got better organized, and reached its peak intensity of and 50 mph (85 km/h) on September 29. The tropical storm then turned to the west-southwest as steering currents collapsed. The cyclone began a time of erratic motion, which included two loops. The erratic motion also exposed Genevieve to wind shear, and the tropical storm weakened to a tropical depression on October 1. On October 6, the shear temporarily weakened, and Tropical Depression Genevieve restrengthened into a tropical storm. The cyclone's wandering continued, and it entrained dry air. This dry air weakened the system to a depression for a second time on October 8, and Genevieve dissipated the next day. Brief flare-ups of convection could still be seen for a few days thereafter. Tropical Storm Genevieve was a rather poorly forecast storm. Most tropical cyclone prediction models indicated a northwesterly track that never happened, and also over-intensified the system. In addition, advisories on Tropical Depression Genevieve were discontinued on October 3, and only resumed three days later. Later analysis determined that Genevieve had been a tropical depression for this whole time. Tropical Storm Genevieve never came near land, and consequently no watches or warnings were required for any location. The tropical cyclone had no impact on any land. =Hurricane Hernan= On September 30, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E. Gradual strengthening ensued, and the depression strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later and was named Hernan. Hernan's initial track was to the west, but the system gradually started to recurve. Its center of circulation reformed, and Hernan briefly turned to the northwest again. By October 2, and Hernan was close to the coast. It strengthened into a hurricane that day. Late on October 2 and early on October 3 Hernan closely paralleled the coast. Interaction with land weakened the cyclone, and when Hernan made landfall on October 3 near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, it was only a minimal hurricane. Land weakened the cyclone, and by the time it emerged into the ocean north of Puerto Vallarta, it was so disorganized that it dissipated on October 5. At its strongest, Hurricane Hernan had winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of . The National Hurricane Center forecasts on the Hurricane were generally forecast slightly worse than the \\"average\\" system. Errors by tropical cyclone prediction models were attributed mainly to Hernan's recurvature. In terms of intensity, this system was correctly predicted to become a hurricane although advisories underforecast its eventual intensity. For the coast from Acapulco to Manzanillo, a tropical storm warning was issued on October 1. A hurricane watch was issued from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo on October 2. It was upgraded to a warning later that day. Also on October 2, the coast from Manzanillo to San Blas was placed under a tropical storm warning. Meanwhile, the hurricane warning was extended to Cabo Corrientes. On October 3, the hurricane warning was extended to San Blas and the tropical storm warning was extended to Mazatl√°n. Because it made landfall in a sparsely populated area, Hernan killed no one. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Flooding occurred in Melaque, Jalisco. Flooding also caused washed- out roads along Mexico Route 200 and 80. In many areas, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Along the coasts of Colima and Jalisco, waves caused by Hernan reached 13 ft (3.9 m) in height. =Tropical Depression Twelve-E= A system acquired enough convection and became organized enough to be considered a tropical depression on November 7. Although the environment was initially favourable and the system was almost upgraded into a tropical storm as was forecast, wind shear kept the cyclone weak. Its convection was eventually destroyed and advisories were ended on November 10. Twelve-E dissipated on November 11 and no deaths or damages were reported. Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1996 USD. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1996. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 2002 season. This is the same list used for the 1990 season, except for Winnie, which had interchanged with Wallis. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Alma * Boris * Cristina * Douglas * Elida * Fausto * Genevieve * Hernan  * Iselle (unused) * Julio (unused) * Kenna (unused) * Lowell (unused) * Marie (unused) * Norbert (unused) * Odile (unused) * Polo (unused)  * Rachel (unused) * Simon (unused) * Trudy (unused) * Vance (unused) * Winnie (unused) * Xavier (unused) * Yolanda (unused) * Zeke (unused) } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.

He last played for Toronto FC in Major League Soccer as a forward, and is now the head coach of the Toronto FC Academy U19 team, as well as an analyst for Sportsnet and Fox Soccer News. Dichio had the honour of scoring the first goal in Toronto FC history against the Chicago Fire on 12 May 2007. Later in that same game he became the first player in club history to be red-carded. Playing career =Europe= Born in Hammersmith, London, to an English mother and an Italian father, Dichio began his career at Queens Park Rangers, joining as an apprentice in June 1991 and turning professional in May 1993. The sale of Les Ferdinand to Newcastle United in the summer of 1995 provided Dichio with the opportunity to break into QPR's first team in the 1995‚Äì96 Premier League season. He scored on his league debut for QPR against Aston Villa, and forged a strike partnership with Kevin Gallen throughout the remainder of the season. Prior to his QPR debut, he played on loan at Barnet and Welling United. Dichio moved to Italy's Serie A with Sampdoria in the close season of 1996, and soon after had a loan spell at Lecce. He returned to England to join Sunderland in January 1998, helping them win promotion to the Premiership as Division One champions with 105 points in his first full season (1998‚Äì99), and finish seventh in the Premiership in the next two seasons. While at Sunderland, Dichio went on loan to West Bromwich Albion at the start of the 2001‚Äì02 season. The spell was a successful one, with Dichio scoring on his debut away at Sheffield Wednesday on 25 August 2001 and again on his home debut in a 1‚Äì0 win against Gillingham two days later. He joined the Midlands side permanently in November 2001 in a ¬£1.25 million deal, and helped them to achieve promotion. In Albion's first Premiership campaign the following season, Dichio was their joint top scorer in the league (with Scott Dobie), though with just five Premiership goals, not enough to prevent relegation. He finished as top scorer overall by virtue of his FA Cup hat- trick against Bradford City. The following season saw Dichio move himself and his family up to the Midlands, having previously commuted from London. Despite settling in the area, however, he failed to regain a starting place in the team and in October 2003, he joined Derby on loan, scoring once against Ipswich Town. He then had another loan spell, this time at Millwall, whom he later joined on a permanent deal. Dichio was unable to play in the 2004 FA Cup final for Millwall, due to suspension. He scored 10 goals in 27 starts for Millwall in the 2004‚Äì05 season. In the summer of 2005, he moved to Preston North End, but did not score in the league in his first season. In the summer of 2006, he was the subject of a bid from Brighton. Although a fee was agreed, Dichio chose to stay at Preston and fight for his place. On 14 October 2006, he scored his first league goal for Preston in a 4‚Äì1 win over Sunderland. Dichio, despite a difficult start to his Preston career, won over the fans at Deepdale causing many to be greatly upset as the news broke that his move to Toronto was to be finalised. =Toronto FC= In April 2007, Dichio was released from his contract to let him join the newly created MLS club Toronto FC. Over the next three seasons, Dichio made 59 league appearances for Toronto in the MLS, Canadian Championship and CONCACAF Champions League games. He scored 14 goals, including the club's first ever goal and the club's last goal of its inaugural season. He managed five goals in five shots on target to start the 2008 Major League Soccer season. That same year, Dichio also cemented his association with the Thornhill Soccer Club, a non-profit club that organises soccer leagues for age groups 4 and up, including adult leagues. On 18 March 2009, he announced his intention retire after the 2009 Major League Soccer season and to continue living in Toronto while also pursuing coaching opportunities. However, on 9 September 2009, Dichio officially announced his retirement with six games remaining on Toronto FC's season schedule. His new role with the team will be as Toronto FC Team Ambassador, participating in local community appearances, and Academy Coach, where he will \\"assist coaches on all three Toronto FC teams while beginning to learn about the nuances of MLS\\". He remains much beloved of Toronto fans, who sing a song in his honour in the 24th minute of each game, commemorating his inaugural goal for the franchise (scored at 23:13 on 12 May 2007 vs. Chicago Fire). He became a permanent resident of Canada in April 2009. In mid-2009, he began working with the Toronto FC Academy. Managerial career Following the firing of head coach Preki in September 2010, Nick Dasovic was named interim head coach, and Dichio became an assistant coach. With new management put in place during the off season-Aron Winter as head coach and Bob de Klerk as assistant-Dichio moved within the club and was named head coach of the TFC Academy U-18 team. Dichio replaced former coach Jason Bent, who was with the Academy for three years before being promoted as Winter's second assistant. Dichio is also the Technical Director for Thornhill Soccer Club.

He played college football at Rice University. Early years Dial was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma, but grew up in Magnolia, Texas. He attended Magnolia High School, where he played six-man football, while being a three-time All-District End and linebacker. He helped his team achieve district titles in his junior and senior years, although they lost the class B regional championship to Sugar Land High School in 1953 and to Barbers Hill High School in 1954. In 2002, he was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame. College career Dial attended Rice University and played as a two-way end on the football team. In 1956, he had 21 receptions for 357 yards, five touchdowns, and was selected sophomore lineman of the year in the Southwest Conference. In 1957, he made 21 receptions (which led the Southwest Conference) for 508 yards, four touchdowns, and was named All-Southwest Conference. He contributed to Rice winning the conference championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and was named to the All-Bowl All-Star team. In 1958, he caught 19 passes for 264 yards and four touchdowns. He was the team's co-captain and Most Valuable Player. He also received consensus All-American and the Columbus Touchdown Club Lineman of the Year honors. Dial recorded 61 receptions for 1,129 yards in his college career. He also posted 13 career receiving touchdowns, tying the school record set by James \\"Froggie\\" Williams. In 1971, he was inducted into the Rice Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career =New York Giants= Dial was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (22nd overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft. He was waived before the start of the season on September 22, 1959. =Pittsburgh Steelers= On September 24, 1959, Dial was claimed off waivers by the Pittsburgh Steelers, teaming him with quarterback Bobby Layne. In 1960, Dial set a team record by having a 24.3-yard average per reception. He tallied 40 receptions for 972 yards and nine touchdowns. In 1961, Dial registered 53 receptions (tied for eighth in the league) for 1,047 yards (fifth in the league), a 19.8-yard average (third in the league), and 12 touchdowns (second in the league and a Steelers franchise record). He became the first player in team history to gain 1,000 receiving yards and also set a team record with 235 receiving yards in the sixth game against the Cleveland Browns, including the longest pass play in Steelers history (88 yards). He set a franchise record by scoring at least one touchdown in 11 consecutive games. In 1962, he recorded 50 receptions for 981 and six touchdowns. After scoring a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys, a loud cannon charge was set off in front of him (a Steelers tradition) as he ran into the endzone; this was memorialized by NFL Films as one of the league's greatest follies. The team made the Playoff Bowl, losing 10-17 against the Detroit Lions. In 1963, he collected 60 receptions (fifth in the league) for 1,295 yards (second in the league and breaking his club record), a 21.6-yard average (led the league) and 9 touchdowns (tied for seventh in the league). On January 1, 1964, with the team looking to shore up its defense, Dial was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for first-round draft choice Scott Appleton, who was selected by the Cowboys after previously agreeing to the deal with the Steelers. Appleton ended up signing with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League, who had also drafted him in the first round. The persistence both teams showed in their attempts to sign Appleton became known as the \\"Buddy Dial for Nothing\\" trade. Dial left with team records of 229 receptions for 4,723 receiving yards, 42 touchdown receptions, single-season touchdown receptions (12), single-game receiving yards (235), single-season receiving yards (1,295), career yard-per-reception average (21.6) and single-season yards-per-reception (24.3). He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection. In 2018, he was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor. =Dallas Cowboys= In 1964, Dial started in one game, after being limited with a thigh injury he suffered in training camp that required surgery. He registered 11 receptions for 178 yards and one touchdown. His best game came against the Steelers, in which he tallied five receptions for 100 yards. In 1965, he started seven games, before being passed on the depth chart by second-year player Peter Gent. Dial recorded 17 receptions for 283 yards and one touchdown in the season. In 1966, he was a backup behind Gent, starting in three games, while making 14 receptions for 252 yards and one touchdown. In 1967, he was placed on the injured reserve list after having back surgery. He announced his retirement in 1968. Dial finished his career with 261 receptions for 5,436 yards, a 20.8-yard average (second in league history), 44 touchdowns, and four carries for 14 yards. Personal life Dial started Christian devotional services with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys. While playing for the Steelers, he recorded an album of inspirational songs called \\"Buddy Dial Sings on Word Records.\\" In 1966, he recorded a single with Challenge Records 59352, \\"Baby\\" b/w \\"Back in the Old Days\\". It became a hit in various regional areas, topping the Dallas KLIF radio charts in late 1966 and early 1967, but failed to make the national charts. Injuries during his NFL career led to significant health problems brought on by the abuse of painkilling drugs (eventually losing a kidney), before receiving treatment in the late 1980s. On February 29, 2008, he died at the age of 71, of complications from prostate cancer and pneumonia.

Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, with the most notable storm of the season being Hurricane Ismael, which killed at least 116 people in Mexico. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), but did not significantly affect land. Hurricane Adolph was an early-season Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Henriette brushed the Baja California Peninsula in early September. The season officially started on May 15, 1995, in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1995, in the Central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1995. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven of these storms attained hurricane status, three of them becoming major hurricanes. There were fewer tropical storms than the average of 16, while the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average. The season marked the beginning of a multi-decade period of low activity in the Eastern Pacific.

Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h). The seasonal activity during 1995 was below normal, and marked the first of several seasons with lower than normal activity. Four tropical cyclones affected Mexico: first, Hurricane Flossie passed within 75 miles (120 km) of Baja California Peninsula, producing moderate winds and killing seven people. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Gil dropped heavy rainfall in Southern Mexico early in its life, though caused no damage. Hurricane Henriette later made landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), resulting in moderate damage but no deaths. Finally, Ismael struck the state of Sinaloa as a minimal hurricane. Offshore, fishermen were caught off guard by the hurricane, causing 57 of them to drown. On land, Ismael destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 homeless and killing another 59. Both Hurricanes Flossie and Ismael also produced moisture and localized damage in the Southwestern United States. Activity in the Central Pacific Ocean was below normal, as well. No tropical storms formed in the basin. For the first time in four years, Barbara was the only tropical cyclone to exist within the basin, but it formed in the Eastern Pacific. It entered as a weakening tropical storm, and quickly dissipated, without affecting land. It was the least activity in the basin since 1979, when the basin was completely quiet, as no storms entered the basin that year. Systems =Tropical Depression One-E= A westward-moving tropical wave entered the Pacific Ocean in mid-May. Convection within the disturbance became more concentrated and organized on May 19 while the wave was located a short distance south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The deep convection concentrated around a low-level circulation with expanding outflow, and the system developed into Tropical Depression One-E on May 21, while located about 400 mi (645 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Initially the depression was forecast to strengthen to reach winds of 55 mph (90 km/h) as it moved westward under the influence of a high-pressure system to its north. Outflow increased as the storm moved through an area of warm waters and a favorable upper-level environment, and two satellite classifications indicated the system was at tropical storm status around nine hours after forming. Despite the favorable environment and satellite classifications of tropical storm status, the depression failed to organize further. The convection and organization continued to decrease, and on May 23 the depression dissipated. While it was developing, locally moderate to heavy rainfall fell across southern Mexico along the disturbance's northern periphery, with rainfall totals peaking at at Vallecitos/Petatlan. =Hurricane Adolph= An area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave organized off the southwest coast of Mexico during the middle of June. Banding features developed as a circulation persisted on the northeast side of its deep convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E on June 15. Under weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly northward, and with deep convection organizing near its center, the depression intensified to Tropical Storm Adolph on June 16. Located in an area of warm waters, Adolph exhibited a well-defined outflow pattern, and rapidly strengthened to attain hurricane status on June 17 as a banding-type eye developed. Hurricane Adolph turned to the northwest and attained major hurricane status late that same day. The small eye of the hurricane continued to organize, as very deep convection surrounded the eyewall, and Adolph reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h) on June 18, making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened, as the upper-level environment became more hostile, and the system moved over progressively cooler waters. On June 19, Adolph turned to the west, and degenerated back into a tropical storm later that day. On June 20, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and on June 21, Adolph began to dissipate as its center became devoid of deep convection. As Adolph moved north towards Mexico while about 290 mi (465 km) off the coast, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. When the storm turned to the northwest and later to the west, the government discontinued the warnings as it was determined the storm would not be a threat to land. No damage or casualties were reported. =Hurricane Barbara= A few days later, on June 24, another weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. It moved steadily westward through the Atlantic Ocean without any development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 5. At this point, convection developed along the wave axis, and the system gradually organized. A circulation developed as it passed through an area of warm waters, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E on July 7, while located about 600 miles (965 km) south of Manzanillo, Colima. Although the outer rainbands warmed slightly in the hours after the formation, the convection near the center deepened further with favorable upper-level outflow, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Barbara early on July 8. Barbara steadily intensified, and following the development of a ragged eye that night, Barbara strengthened into a hurricane on July 9, while located about 700 miles (1130 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. After moving into an area of light vertical shear and warm water temperatures, Barbara quickly intensified to reach major hurricane status on July 10. The eye continued to become better organized, and Barbara attained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) later on July 10. After maintaining its intensity for 24 hours, increased wind shear from an upper- tropospheric trough degraded the appearance of the deepest convection, and the eye became obscured from satellite images. After weakening to a 115 mph (185 km/h) hurricane, Barbara maintained its intensity for 30 hours before moving into an area with very warm waters and a favorable upper-level environment. On July 13, the hurricane re-organized, a distinct eye again developed, and Barbara strengthened to reach its peak intensity of 140 mph (225 km/h) later that day. Barbara continued westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north, and began to steadily weaken on July 14 as it moved into an area of cooler water temperatures. The hurricane degraded to a tropical storm on July 16, and a day later it deteriorated to a tropical depression. As a depression with little to no convection near its center, Barbara continued west-northwestward until dissipating on July 18 while located 720 mi (1160 km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Barbara remained away from land for its entire lifetime, and it did not cause any damage or deaths. =Hurricane Cosme= As Barbara moved away from land, another area of disturbed weather moved off the coast of Central America on July 11. Moving westward, this area slowly organized, and developed a low-level circulation on July 22. The convection developed into curved rainbands, and based on Dvorak classifications of 35 mph (55 km/h), the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 17, while located about 400 mi (645 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. As the depression was situated in an area with warm waters and moderate upper-level outflow, the system was forecast to slowly intensify to a 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm. Initially, the depression followed the forecasts, and it intensified into a tropical storm about 30 hours after developing, receiving the name \\"Cosme\\". Cosme was expected to strengthen only slightly due to predicted cooler waters and increased shear. On July 18, contrary to the predictions, Cosme became much better organized, and well-defined banding features were visible on satellite imagery. The storm continued to steadily intensify, and subsequent to the development of an eye, Cosme strengthened into a hurricane late on July 19, while located 380 miles (615 km) west- southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. After maintaining hurricane status for 18 hours, Cosme weakened back to a tropical storm on July 20. Cooler water temperatures deteriorated the convection near the center, resulting in Cosme quickly weakening to a tropical depression on July 21. After turning to the west-southwest, Cosme dissipated on July 22. Cosme never affected land, and as a result caused no damage or fatalities. However, the intensity of the storm is still uncertain; late on July 18, a ship to the east of Cosme reported winds of 17 mph (27 km/h), despite that a normal 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm would produce tropical storm force winds for locations within at least 70 mi (110 km) of the center. =Tropical Storm Dalila= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 11. It moved westward and quickly developed two areas of convection along the wave axis. One of the areas nearly developed into a tropical depression after moving northwestward, though it failed to organize further and dissipated. The southern area continued westward and ultimately entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 21. Thunderstorms along the wave axis became more concentrated a few hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Five-E on July 24 while located 500 mi (800 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Located in an area of weak steering currents and easterly wind shear, the tropical depression drifted to the north-northeast while the convection was displaced up to 70 mi (110 km) west of the circulation. Slightly strengthening occurred, and on July 25 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dalila. The storm turned to the northwest, and later to the west-northwest, and remained a minimal tropical storm until July 28 when a decrease in wind shear allowed Dalila to strengthen. A strong anticyclone developed to the north of the system, causing Dalila to accelerate to the northwest. Late on July 28, Dalila reached a peak intensity of 65 mph (105 km/h) at a position 570 mi (915 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Tropical Storm Dalila slowly weakened after moving over progressively cooler water temperatures, and on August 1 it degenerated into a tropical depression. Dalila turned to the southwest after much of the convection waned, and the system dissipated on August 2. =Tropical Storm Erick= On July 17 a tropical wave exited the coast of Africa, and moved westward. An area of convection along the wave organized slightly on July 18, though the next day the convection diminished. After moving through the Windward Islands on July 23, deep convection again increased. The system failed to organize further, though convection continued to develop upon entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 27. The cloudiness and thunderstorms became more consolidated off the coast of southern Mexico, and on July 31 Dvorak classifications began on the system. A circulation developed, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Six-E on August 1 while located about 520 mi (835 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. Initially, the depression was a small system with moderate amounts of easterly wind shear. It organized slowly, and after moving to the southwest for 24 hours it turned to the northwest. Subsequent to an increase in convection over the center, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Erick on August 4. Erick gradually strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest, and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) on August 5 while located about 720 miles (1160 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Operationally, the storm was forecast to continue to strengthen to reach hurricane status, though this did not occur. The mid-level ridge which had been tracking Erick westward weakened, resulting in Erick to turn to the north over cooler waters. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression on August 6, and after turning to an eastward drift Erick dissipated on August 8 while located 700 mi (1130 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. Erick never affected land. =Hurricane Flossie= A large circulation with an area of low pressure persisted in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean in early August. The large circulation was well-developed by August 7, and the convection concentrated a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco. Based on its organization, the National Hurricane Center designated the system Tropical Depression Seven-E. On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie, based on ship reports. The storm paralleled the coast of Mexico as it moved northwestward, and after a decrease of wind shear Flossie developed very deep convection over its center. It intensified into a hurricane on August 10, reaching peak winds of as an embedded warm spot appeared in the center of the storm. After maintaining its peak intensity for 18 hours and passing within of Baja California Peninsula, Flossie weakened over cooler waters and degenerated to a tropical storm on August 12. The storm continued to weaken, and early on August 14 Flossie dissipated. The government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes early in its life, though it was discontinued shortly thereafter. Officials issued a tropical storm watch and later a warning for Baja California Sur south of La Paz, which was later extended from Loreto on the east coast to San Juanico on the west coast. The large circulation of Hurricane Flossie produced gusty winds along the west coast of Mexico and southern Baja California Peninsula. Cabo San Lucas reported a gust of 55 mph (90 km/h), and San Jos√© del Cabo recorded a gust of 65 mph (105 km/h). The storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at at San Felipe/Los Cabos. Seven people died in Mexico from the storm, including two that drowned in Cabo San Lucas. A monsoon surge moving around its eastern periphery produced heavy rainfall in the American Southwest. Flooding from the rainfall killed one person and left eleven motorists stranded. Thunderstorms in Tucson, Arizona, produced hurricane-force wind gusts which caused widespread power outages and damage. Damage from the storm in Arizona totaled to $5 million (1995 USD; $ USD), although damage in Mexico, if any, is unknown. =Tropical Storm Gil= An area of disturbed weather, possibly related to a tropical wave, persisted and gradually organized in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A circulation developed within its deep convection, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 19 while located about 115 mi (185 km) southeast of Acapulco. Operationally, it was not until 15 hours later that the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the system. The depression moved westward and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. A nearby ship confirmed the existence of tropical storm force winds, and Gil reached winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) early on August 21. With well- defined outflow and continually developing convection, forecasters predicted Gil to strengthen more and attain hurricane status within two days of becoming a tropical storm. However, increased northeasterly wind shear initially prevented further strengthening. On August 22, the cloud pattern of Gil became better organized, though the low-level circulation was located to the northeast of the deep convection due to the wind shear. The shear also limited outflow to the east, preventing further strengthening. Gradually the convection developed nearer to the center. After Gil turned to the northwest, the deep convection organized into a central dense overcast, and it strengthened to reach winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on August 24. Later that day the storm attained a peak strength of 65 mph (105 km/h) while located 380 mi (610 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. After maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours, Gil moved over progressively cooler waters, and weakened to a tropical depression on August 26. The depression drifted westward and later turned to the north, and dissipated on August 27 while located 670 mi (1075 km) to the west of Cabo San Lucas. While located a short distance off of Mexico, Gil produced heavy rainfall near the coast. However, there were no reports of casualties or damages in association with the storm. =Hurricane Henriette= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low- level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170 mi (270 km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220 mi (350 km) west of Manzanillo. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135 mi (235 km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Late on September 3, an eye began to form in the center of the deep convection as Henriette turned to the northwest. The eye became better defined the next day, and Henriette attained a peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) as the northern portion of the eyewall moved over southern Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane quickly crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula and re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean. Convection gradually waned as the hurricane moved over progressively colder waters, and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression. On September 2, a few hours after Henriette became a tropical storm, the government of Mexico issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches for Baja California Peninsula. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route. Winds of up to in southern Baja California Sur left much of Cabo San Lucas without water or power. 2,000 people were directly affected by the hurricane. A strong storm surge produced flooding and heavy road damage in the state. 800 people were forced from their homes, and crop damage was reported. No damage estimates are available, and no deaths were reported. =Hurricane Ismael= Hurricane Ismael developed from a persistent area of deep convection on September 12, and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210 mi (340 km) off the coast of Mexico. It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of Baja California Peninsula it made landfall on Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. The remnants entered the United States and extended eastward into the mid-Atlantic states. Offshore, Ismael produced waves of up to 30 ft (9 m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared by the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, and as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people homeless. On land, Ismael caused 59 casualties in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26 million in damage (1995 USD; $ USD). Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico. =Hurricane Juliette= Hurricane Juliette was the strongest and final hurricane of the season. It formed on September 16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and moved west-northwest for the early part of its duration. Juliette was smaller than usual tropical cyclones, and as a result it intensified quickly, reaching hurricane status on September 18 and major hurricane status a day later. On September 20, Juliette reached peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), a Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. It subsequently began a slow weakening trend and turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula. Instead, strong wind shear overcame the storm, and Juliette dissipated on September 26 without significantly affecting land. =Other systems= According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), on January 4 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on January 4, and three days later it exited CPHC's area of responsibility. According to the JTWC and Japan Meteorological Agency, on November 10 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on November 10, and soon it exited CPHC's area of responsibility. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 1995. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2001 season. This is the same list used for the 1989 season with the exception of Wallis, which switched places with Winnie, the original \\"W\\" name on this list. The name Dalila was used for the first time in 1995; in the 1989 season, it was Dalilia, though an error in documents prior to the season changed it. The name change has remained. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Adolph * Barbara * Cosme * Dalila * Erick * Flossie * Gil * Henriette  * Ismael * Juliette * Kiko (unused) * Lorena (unused) * Manuel (unused) * Narda (unused) * Octave (unused) * Priscilla (unused)  * Raymond (unused) * Sonia (unused) * Tico (unused) * Velma (unused) * Wallis (unused) * Xina (unused) * York (unused) * Zelda (unused) } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.

Charlton Heston played a supporting role as Andrew Jackson, the second time that Heston played Jackson, having portrayed him earlier in the 1953 film The President's Lady. The film was shot in Technicolor and VistaVision, the story takes place during the War of 1812, telling a heavily fictionalized version of how the privateer Lafitte helped in the Battle of New Orleans and how he had to choose between fighting for America or for the side most likely to win, the United Kingdom. The movie's supporting cast featured Inger Stevens, Henry Hull, E. G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Ted de Corsia, Ed Hinton, Douglass Dumbrille and Majel Barrett. Ty Hardin was uncredited) Anthony Quinn directed the film. Possibly as a film tie-in, Johnny Horton had a big success at the time with his version of the song The Battle of New Orleans.

Quinn was given five stars, fifty-five featured actors, 100 bit actors, 12,000 extras, 60,000 props, $100,000 worth of antique furniture, Spanish moss, and cypress trees. Historical inaccuracy Claiborne's only surviving daughter, Sophronie (or Sophronia) Louise Claiborne, was only two years old at the time of the battle. The romance with Lafitte is complete fiction. 1938 film The film is a remake of the 1938 film of the same name which starred Fredric March and Akim Tamiroff (Boyer played Tamiroff's role in the remake). The 1938 version was produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, but he was seriously ill by the time the 1958 version was made, so he was only the executive producer of that version, leaving his then son-in-law, Anthony Quinn, to direct. It was the only film that Quinn ever directed. Henry Wilcoxon, DeMille's longtime friend, who made frequent appearances in his films, was the actual producer, and DeMille did received screen credit as \\"supervised by Cecil B. Demille\\", though students of his films would probably find that his touch is obvious throughout the film. Reception =Critical response= Staff writers for Variety wrote in their review: \\"Continuity-wise, Buccaneer is a scrambled affair in the early reels. Open to question, also, are the story angles in the screenplay which derives from a previous Buccaneer scenario put out by DeMille in 1938 and, in turn, from an adaptation of the original book, Lafitte the Pirate, by Lyle Saxon.\\" In his book, Success in the Cinema Money Making Movies, John Howard Reid, states most reviews of the film left out the director's name, Quinn, like Time and Newsweek. The Time review states: \\"What (Henry) Wilcoxon and Quinn have produced is just a half-deflated imitation of the old man at his overblown best.\\" The Newsweek review stated without criticizing anyone: \\"two hours of the most pretentious nonsense to lay claim to a moviegoer's spending money.\\" =Release= The Buccaneer was released in New York City theatres during Christmas week of 1958. The film was released on DVD ON February 28, 2012, by Olive Films.

Born in Najaf, Iraq, Fadlallah studied Islam in Najaf before moving to Lebanon in 1952. In the following decades, he gave many lectures, engaged in intense scholarship, wrote dozens of books, founded several Islamic religious schools, and established the Mabarrat Association. Through the aforementioned association, he established a public library, a women's cultural center, and a medical clinic. Fadlallah was sometimes called the \\"spiritual mentor\\" of Hezbollah in the media, although this was disputed by other sources. He was also the target of several assassination attempts, including the 1985 Beirut car bombing. His death was followed by a huge turnout in Lebanon, visits by virtually all major political figures across the Lebanese spectrum, and statements of condolence from across the greater Middle East region; but it also led to controversy in the west and a denunciation in Israel.https://www.haaretz.com/1.5144427  Early life Fadlallah was born in the Iraqi Shia shrine city of Najaf on 16 November 1935. His parents, Abdulraouf Fadlullah and al-Hajja Raoufa Hassan Bazzi, had migrated there from the village of 'Aynata in south Lebanon in 1928 to learn theology. By the time of his birth, his father was already a Muslim scholar.  Education Fadlallah went first to a traditional school (KuttƒÅb) to learn the Quran and the basic skills of reading and writing. He soon left and went to a more \\"modern\\" school that was established by the publisher Jamiat Muntada Al-Nasher where he remained for two years and studied in the third and fourth elementary classes. At these schools he began studying the religious sciences at a very young age. He started to read the Ajroumiah when he was nine years old, and then he read Qatr al-Nada wa Bal Al-Sada (Ibn Hisham). He completed Sutouh in which the student reads the book and listens to his teacher's explanation. He also studied the Arabic language, logic and Jurisprudence, and did not need another teacher until he studied the second part of the course known as Kifayat at Usul which he studied with an Iranian teacher named Sheikh mujtaba Al-Linkarani. He attended the so-called Bahth Al-Kharij in which the teacher does not restrict himself to a certain book but gives more or less free lectures. Fadlallah published a minor periodical before going to Lebanon. At the age of ten, he put out a handwritten literary journal with some of his friends.  Return to Lebanon  After 21 years of studying under the prominent teachers of the Najaf religious university he concluded his studies in 1966 and returned to Lebanon. He had already visited Lebanon in 1952 where he recited a poem eulogizing Muhsin al Amin at his funeral. In 1966 Fadlallah received an invitation from a group who had established a society called \\"Usrat Ataakhi\\" (The family of Fraternity) that became the Islamic Dawa Party in Lebanon to come and live with them in the area of Naba'a in Eastern Beirut. He agreed, especially as the conditions at Najaf impelled him to leave. In Naba'a Fadlallah began his work, by organising cultural seminars and delivering religious speeches that discussed social issues as well. Nevertheless, Fadlallah's main concern was to continue to develop his academic work. Thus he founded a religious school called the Islamic Sharia Institute in which several students enrolled who later became prominent religious scholars including Sheikh Ragib Harb. He also established a public library, a women's cultural centre and a medical clinic. When the Lebanese Civil War forced him to leave the area, he moved to the Southern Suburbs where he started to give priority to teaching and educating the people. He used the mosque as his centre for holding daily prayers giving lessons in Qur'anic interpretation, as well as religious and moral speeches, especially on religious occasions such as Ashura. He soon resumed his academic work and began to give daily lessons in Islamic principles, jurisprudence and morals. In 1982 Dawa unites with other Islamic Shia armed organizations (Islamic Amal, Islamic Jihad Organization, Jundallah and Imam Hussein suicide squad) to found Hezbollah.  Assassination attempts  As one of the alleged leaders of Hezbollah, a status both he and the group denied he was the target of several assassination attempts, including the allegedly CIA-sponsored and funded 8 March 1985 Beirut car bombing that killed 80 people. On 8 March 1985, a car bomb equivalent to of dynamite exploded 9‚Äì45 metres from his house in Beirut, Lebanon. The blast destroyed a 7-story apartment building and a cinema, killed 80 people and wounded 256. The attack was timed to go off as worshippers were leaving Friday Prayers. Most of the dead were girls and women who had been leaving the mosque, though the ferocity of the blast \\"burned babies in their beds,\\" \\"killed a bride buying her trousseau,\\" and \\"blew away three children as they walked home from the mosque.\\" It also \\"devastated the main street of the densely populated\\" West Beirut suburb. but Fadlallah escaped injury. One of his bodyguards at the time was Imad Mughniyeh, who was later assassinated in a car-bombing in February 2008. According to Bob Woodward, CIA director William Casey was involved in the attack, which he suggests was carried out with funding from Saudi Arabia. \\"In his book Woodward portrays Casey as a wily and aggressive director who made the CIA his personal instrument of foreign policy. In early 1985 Woodward reports, Casey went \\"off the books\\" to enlist Saudi help in carrying out three covert operations. One was the attempted assassination of Sheik Fadlallah, who had been linked to the bombings in Beirut. After that plot failed, Woodward writes, the Saudis offered Fadlallah a $2 million bribe to cease his terrorist attacks. He accepted, and the attacks stopped. Woodward's account of the incident was denied last week by the Saudi press agency and by Fadlallah's office.\\" Former Lebanese warlord and statesman late Elie Hobeika was accused as one of those likely responsible for the actual operation. During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Israeli warplanes bombed his two-story house in Beirut's southern Haret Hreik neighborhood. Fadlallah was not at home at the time of the bombing, which reduced the house to rubble. Hezbollah connection He has been variously attributed by the media as being the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Al Manar said he had at least \\"inspired the leaders\\" of the group. It added that \\"From the pulpit of the Imam Rida mosque in the Bir al-Abd neighborhood, Sayyed Fadlullah's sermons gave shape to the political currents among mainly the Muslim Shiite sect [of Lebanon], from the latter half of the 1980s till the last days of his life.\\" Other sources, such as journalist Robert Fisk, also refuted such claims that he was affiliated with the group.  Views  He supported the Iranian Islamic Revolution. In his sermons, he called for armed resistance to the Israeli occupations of Lebanon, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, along with opposition to the existence of Israel. He held relatively liberal views on the status of women. When he died in 2010, TIME magazine wrote about his contrarian stance: \\"Fadlallah had broken with Hizballah and the toxic legacy of his early edicts. He criticized Iran's clerical rule, supported women's rights and insisted on dialogue with the West.\\" = U.S. foreign policy = He has asked for a boycott of American products. This boycott should become an overwhelming trend that makes these two states feel that their economies are in a real and actual danger.)) In November 2007, Fadlallah accused the United States of trying to sabotage the election in Lebanon: \\"The insanity of the U.S. president and its administration is reflected in Lebanon by their ambassador pressuring the Lebanese people and preventing them from reaching an agreement over the presidential election.\\" Though he welcomed the election of Barack Obama as the American president, the following year he expressed disappointment with Obama's lack of progress in the Middle East peace process saying he appeared to have no plan to bring peace to the region.  9/11 criticism  Despite his criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, he condemned the September 11 attacks in the United States as acts of terrorism. =Israel= Fadlallah made statements in favour of suicide bombings against Israeli citizens. In a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said: His support for suicide bombings against Israel were based on the grounds that the latter uses advanced weaponry; it was also claimed that he wished that the state of Israel would cease to exist. Following the Mercaz HaRav massacre, Fadlallah called the attack \\"heroic.\\" Western sources also cite his favour for suicide bombings against Israeli citizens. Fadlallah explained the religious basis for suicide attacks in an interview with Daily Star.\\"Fadlallah explains religious basis for suicide attacks \\" by Ibrahim Mousawi, 8 June 2002 In September 2009, Fadlallah issued a fatwa banning normalisation of ties with Israel. He also objected to any territorial settlement, saying \\"the entire land of Palestine within its historical borders is one Arab-Islamic country and no one has right to spare on[e] inch of it.\\" Another English translation (from the Arabic in Al Akhbar) was given in The Daily Middle East Reporter.Fadlallah Bans \\"Any Form of Normalization\\" with Israel 15 September 2009 =Islamic governance= Despite his ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Fadlallah distanced himself from the Ayatollah Khomeini's legacy of Veleyat-e Faqih as theocratic rule by Islamic clerics was said to argue that \\"no Shia religious leader, not even Khomeini‚Ä¶ has a monopoly on the truth.\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 181 He also first endorsed Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani rather than Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the marja for Shia in matters of religion, before claiming the role for himself.Wilfried Buchta, \\"Die Islamische Republik Iran und die religi√∂s-politische Kontroverse um die marja'iyat\\", Orient 36, 3 (1995): 459-60 In a 2009 interview, Fadlallah said that he did not believe wilayat al- faqih has a role in modern Lebanon. = Women = Fadlallah was known for his relatively liberal views on women, whom he sees as equal to men. He believed that women have just as much of a responsibility towards society as men do, and women should be role models for both men and women. But almost all of the mainstream faqihs say the same thing as does the Quran so he wasn't giving anything new on the role of women in society and family. Fadlallah also believed that women have the same exact ability as men to fight their inner weaknesses. He saw the hijab as something that makes a man see a woman not as a sex object, but instead as a human being. He believes, like all of his peers in the Islamic seminary that women should cover their entire body except for their face and hands, and that they should avoid wearing excessive makeup when they go out in public. Fadlallah also issued a fatwa on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that supports the right of a woman to defend herself against any act of violence whether social or physical. The fatwa reaffirms the rights of women, both at their workplace and at home, and states that Islam forbids men from exercising any form of violence against women and forbids men from depriving women of their legal rights. In his words \\"physical violence in which women are beaten, proves that these men are weak, for only the weak are in need of unjust violence\\". He also issued fatwas forbidding female circumcision and honour killings. Yet, almost all of the leading Fiqih leaders believe in the same treatment and honor of women within Islam. = Abortion = He was opposed to abortion in most cases; however, when the women is in an abnormal amount of danger by the pregnancy, he believed it was permissible. =Amman Message= He was one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy. Controversial views regarding Islamic doctrine Fadlallah held controversial views regarding Islamic doctrine, as espoused in some of his works and speeches.https://hubeali.com/articles/Fadlollahs-Devious- Beliefs.pdf He also issued many fatwas and opinions that courted controversy, for which he was condemned and not supported by other eminent Islamic scholars, including a representative of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani,Lebanon: Sistani deputy refuses to meet Fadlallah due to stance on Fatimah Az-Zahraa (A), by Karim Tellawi, Jafariya News the office of Grand Ayatollah Mirza Jawad Tabrizi, in the holy city of Qom, released a statement that \\"any help to or cooperation with him in publishing his writings is not legal with respect to Islam\\".http://www.jafariyanews.com/2k7_news/may/10Fadhlullah_Dhaal.htm He was also condemned by Grand Ayatollahs Bashir al-Najafi, Hossein Waheed Khorasani, Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi, Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi and others. Students *Yasser Awdeh  Social work  Fadlallah was quoted as saying, \\"We have to improve our education and gain more scientific knowledge. If we do not make the best of our time now, we will not be able to build our future or develop in the future.\\" In addition to the academic work that Fadlallah did, he also opened up schools, Islamic centres, and orphanages: = Schools = # The Imam Al-Khoei Orphanage, Beirut (Dawha) # Imam Al-Baqir Secondary school, Beka\`a (Hirmil) # Imam Al-Jawed Secondary school, Beka\`a (Ali Nahri) # Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib school, South Lebanon (Ma\`roub) # Imam Hassan Secondary school, Beirut (Ruwais) # Al-Mujtaba Secondary School, Beirut (Hay Al-Salum) # Imam Ja\`afar As-Sadiq school, South Lebanon (Jwaya) # Al-Kauther Secondary school, Beirut (Bir Hassan) # Imam Hussein School, Beka\`a (Suh\`mour), under construction # Ali Al-Akbar Vocational Institute Beirut (Doha) = Islamic centres = # The large Islamic Center, Beirut (Haret Hreik)Consists of the Al-Imamain Hassnian Mosque, the Zah\`ra Hall and the Islamic Cultural Center. # Imam Hasan Askari Center Beka\`a'(Sira'in) # Imam Hussein Center-Beka\`a(Jlala) # Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib center South Lebanon.(AL-Hawzah-Sour) # Ahl Al-Beit Mosque Beka\`a' (Rayak) # Imam Ja'far Al-Sadiq Mosque Beka\`a (Hirmil) # Ahl Al- Beit Center, North Lebanon (Tripoli) # Sayyida Zaynab Mosque, Beka\`a (Baalbeck) = Orphanages = # Imam Al-Khoei Orphanage (Beirut-Doha) # Imam Zein Al-Abidine (A.S.)

Death Fadlallah was hospitalized several times in the months before his death, suffering from internal bleeding. His frailty prevented him from delivering Friday sermons in the weeks preceding his death. Fadlallah's media office announced his death at Al- Hassanein Mosque in the southern Beirut suburb of Haret Hureik on 4 July 2010. He was 74. His office said the funeral was scheduled for 6 July at 13:30 p.m. leaving from his house, his burial to be in Al-Hasanein Mosque. His family received condolences at the mosque. The day was also declared by Lebanon as a day of national mourning. The cabinet's General Secretariat said all public institutions and administrations, headquarters of municipalities, private and public schools and universities would be closed. The Lebanese flag would be lowered to half-mast in public institutions and administration and the headquarters of municipalities. Radio and television programmes would also be \\"adjusted in line with the painful occasion.\\" At his funeral, his supporters carried his body around Shia neighbourhoods in southern Beirut, then marched to the spot of his 1985 assassination attempt before returning to Imam Rida Mosque, where he was laid to rest. Thousands of mourners gathered at the mosque for prayer services before the funeral procession. Delegations included representatives from Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Syria and Iran. Thousands of his followers also gathered outside his mosque in Haret Hreik. Al-Manar broadcast the funeral. They said thousands of his followers took part in his funeral and told \\"his eminence for the last time their 'own secrets' and vowing to stay committed to his path. They told him that even if he has died, he will remain the ideal and the model for them, that even if he has died, his eminence will remain a great man in the eyes of all those who had the chance to know him, and his views will continue to circulate from one generation to another\\". Al- Manar said his followers \\"launched a school of beliefs and thoughts, a school that would always be committed to the main causes of Islam, from Jihad to Resistance, and face all foreign threats against the region.\\" It claimed that Fadlallah \\"committed to the central cause, Palestine, calling to fight occupation through all possible means. His eminence issued different 'fatwa's calling to fight Israel and boycott American goods and ban normalizing of relations, and was a 'true supporter' of Islamic unity all over his life. In his last moments before his death, Sayyed Fadlullah was still preoccupied with the cause. He was asking about the dawn prayers and telling his nurse that he wouldn't rest before Israel's vanishing.\\" =Reactions= * Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri, called him \\"a voice of moderation and an advocate of unity\\" for the Lebanese people. Hezbollah declared three days of mourning and Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah vowed to stay faithful to the \\"sacred goals\\" he had \\"sacrificed his life to achieve.\\" He added that \\"we have lost a compassionate father, a wise guide, a fortified shelter, and a strong support that was present at all stages. [He] was all the above mentioned for us and for the whole religious and resistant generation since we were youngsters praying behind him. This is what his eminence was to us, and to all this faithful, struggling, and resisting generation, since the time we were youths praying in his assembly (congregational prayers), guided by his words, and learning beneath his pulpit. In his school, he taught us to advocate with wisdom and kind preaching, to be people of dialogue with others, to reject tyranny, to resist occupation, to adore meeting God the Almighty with certitude, and to be people of patience, steadfastness, and determination even with all the calamities, hardships, and distress we face. To us, he was the teacher, instructor, the knowledge, and the light that lights up our way through every hardship. His pure soul, enlightened intellect, kind words, compassionate smile, chaste biography, and firm stances will remain within us as a guide, conduit, and progressing strong motive that pushes us forth to continuous hard work and jihad.\\" He visited Fadlallah's family to express condolences on behalf of Hezbollah. The Loyalty to the Resistance bloc offered its condolences to the country adding that the country \\"loyal to his eminence's values and principles would continue his path with more enthusiasm to achieve his human goals of freedom and justice.\\" The Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri said the Islamic nation has lost \\"a leading advocate of Muslim unity and a resounding voice supporting what is right and just, and resisting injustice and aggression\\". He praised Fadlallah as one of the most prominent pillars of coexistence among cultures and religions in Lebanon, calling him a \\"backer of the resistance until his last breath\\". A delegation from his parliamentary Liberation and Development parliamentary bloc also visited the clerics' family. Phalange leader Amin Gemayel and a delegation of his party's MPs, former Premier and Sidon MP Fouad Siniora, the Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Abdel-Karim, Lebanese Army commander General Jean Kahwaji, head of the Free Patriotic Movement and Kesrouan MP Michel Aoun, accompanied by a delegation from his Change and Reform bloc and Beirut Metropolitan for Greek Orthodox Bishop Elias Audi, heading a number of religious figures. paid their respects at Fadlallah's death as well. Fadlallah's followers remembered him fondly for his compassion, his support of women's rights, and his teachings on topics such as sex and smoking. The day after the funeral Mufti Mohamad Rashid Qabbani, former Prime Minister Omar Karame, the head of the Marada movement Suleiman Franjieh, former Iraqi Prime Ministers Ibrahim Jaafari and Iyad Allawi, the head of the Lebanese Democratic Movement Talal Arslan, the Egyptian ambassador Ahmad Badyawi, MP's Gebran Bassil, Ibrahim Najjar, Salim Warde, and George Odwan came to the mosque to offer their condolences. Additional visitors included Ali al-Adib on behalf of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Sami al-Jawad representing former Speaker Kamel al-Asaad, Director General of Internal Security Forces Major General Ashraf Rifi, Bishop Elias Kfouri. Nasrallah also received the Grand Mufti of the Lebanese Republic Sheikh Mohammad Rashid Qabbani who offered his condolences. A statement released by Hezbollah said the two discussed Fadlallah's \\"glorious deeds and the big loss caused by his death to Lebanon and the nation.\\" Although representatives of Shia, Sunni, Druze, Christian, and other non-religious figures expressed regret at Fadlullah's death, the conspicuous absence of Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir was viewed as a \\"boycott\\" by Al-Akhbar, because of Fadlallah's response to Sfeir's comments about the rule of the majority and the opposition of the minority in Lebanon. **Al Manar had its own tribute for him saying \\"Dubbed by the media as the \\"Spiritual Leader\\" of the Islamic resistance \\"Hezbollah\\", in Lebanon, Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlullah inspired the leaders for the resistance group, and served as a highly influential beacon of truth for all the oppressed peoples of the world.\\" Adding that \\"Fadlullah was not only a Muslim reference and authority but rather one of the most prominent contemporary religious authorities in the Islamic World. His great experience in teaching jurisprudence as well as his constant monitoring of the latest trends and literature of the major religious schools have enabled him to launch his own school and to be followed by thousands of Muslim believers in Lebanon and the region\\". They added that Fadlallah united Lebanon after his death, saying he was \\"able to deliver a message of unity and peace to all Lebanese, a message of commitment to all values and principles, at the top of which comes the recognition of the patriots. Through his sorrowful death, Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Mohamad Hussein Fadlullah accomplished his mission and joined Lebanese, all Lebanese regardless of their identities and sects, around him. With his sad death, Ayatollah Sayyed Fadlullah made the headlines in Lebanon and the region as his lovers and supporters were unable to believe that this great man has actually passed away.\\" Other media outlets in Lebanon also offered tributes to Fadlallah. Assafir noted the religious diversity of people at his funeral as well delegations from Syria, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Iraq, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and other countries that were present. Al-Liwa, Asharq, and Addiyar also had headline articles on his death. ***His family thanked Hezbollah's Secretary General and leadership for the consolations they expressed. * The Organisation of the Islamic Conference issued a statement lamenting the death with great affection and sorrow. \\"Sayyed Fadlullah's death represents a great death to the Islamic nation, where he lived loyal in serving his country and his nation's issues, presenting a symbol in rapprochement between sects. With his death, the Islamic nation loses one of the most prominent Islamic figures, who played a great role in supporting the Islamic solidarity.\\" * King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa also sent his to Fadlallah's family expressing his sincere condolences to the family, and prayed for the Fadlallah's soul to rest in eternal peace. He also praised Fadlullah's scientific and religious contributions in the service of Islam and Muslims. * In Iraq, Ali al-Adeeb, a senior member of the Dawa party, called his death a major loss to the Islamic world adding that: \\"It will be hard to replace him\\". In Fadlallah's birthplace, however, his death was met with a chilly reception without banners or open displays of mourning as clergy in Najaf expressed discomfort over his legacy and liberal values. * The Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei cabled his condolences to Fadlullah's family and his supporters saying \\"This great intellectual and Mujahid had a huge impact and influence in the political and religious scenes in Lebanon. We won't forget his numerous favors and blessings throughout the years. Sayyed Fadlullah was loyal to the path of the Islamic Revolution and proved this through words and actions throughout the Islamic Republic's thirty years.\\" The Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran. Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Fadlallah was an ideal fit to the Hadith that says \\"The death of a religious scholar causes such a void in Islam that nothing can fill up.\\" Adding that he was an ideal struggler scholar, and the number of assassination attempts he faced for his path are the biggest honour. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his condolences to Lebanese President Michel Suleiman saying \\"The brilliant and valuable service of the honourable cleric for national unity and his perseverance with the resistance will live on in the history of Lebanon.\\" Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki sent his condolences to Lebanese officials such as Hasan Nasrallah, Nabih Berri, his Lebanese counterpart Ali Shami, and Fadlallah's son, Ali Fadlallah, expressing his condolences to the Lebanese government and people, as well as to Fadlallah's family. Parliamentary Speaker Ali Larijani issued a statement emphasizing that Fadlallah \\"spent his blessed life in favor of Islam and the Lebanese people,\\" while noting that he used to observe situations with a critical view and bright mind, while enlightening Muslims at the right times, he also used to build an obstacle for the enemy. An Iranian delegation headed by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati was present for the funeral. * An Israeli spokesman said Ayatollah Fadlallah was \\"unworthy of praise\\". They also criticised Britain's ambassador to Lebanon for eulogising him. * Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al- Jaber Al-Sabah also sent his condolences to the family of Fadlallah saying he prayed to Almighty Allah to have mercy on the soul of the deceased. National Assembly Speaker Jassem Mohammed Al-Khorafi also sent a cable of condolences to his Lebanese counterpart consoling him on the death of Fadlallah. Al- Khorafi expressed his heartfelt sorrow at the news, asking God to have mercy on the soul of the deceased. He also sent a similar cable to the family of Fadlullah. * President Mahmoud Abbas sent his condolences to his Lebanese counterpart. The head of Hamas' Political Bureau, Khaled Meshaal, sent a letter to Fadlallah's son lamenting the loss of his father. \\"The dear deceased was one of the nation's special and great figures, with his knowledge, grace, moderation, mediation, forgiveness and openness to others, in addition to his courageous stances regarding the nation's issues, especially towards the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Zionist struggle. His eminence was one of the greatest symbols and scholars defending the choice of resistance and Jihad against the occupation, in support of the Palestinian strife and our people's right to freedom, liberty and liberation.\\" An Hamas delegation from Gaza headed by Marwan Abu Ras was also present at the funerary services. * Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani offered condolences to the Lebanese people on behalf of Qatar, its Emir, government and people. Upon arrival in Beirut, al- Thani praised the \\"commendable attributes of Fadlallah and his relentless efforts in seeking rapprochement and conciliation among various Muslim sects.\\" * Saudi Arabia sent a delegation for the funeral. * Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to offer his condolences and asked to relay them to Fadlallah's family and the Lebanese people. Nasrallah responded in appreciation and for Erdogan's stance on the Palestinian issue. * The British ambassador to Lebanon, Frances Guy, also wrote: \\"I remember well, when I was nominated ambassador to Beirut, a Muslim acquaintance sought me out to tell me how lucky I was because I would get a chance to meet Sayyed Mohamad Hussein Fadlullah. Truly he was right...I usually avoid answering by referring to those I enjoy meeting the most and those that impress me the most. Until yesterday my preferred answer was to refer to Sayyed Mohamad Hussein Fadlullah. When you visited him you could be sure of a real debate, a respectful argument and you knew you would leave his presence feeling a better person.

It lived during the Albian and Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous. The type and only species is Arkansaurus fridayi. History In August 1972, Joe B. Friday, who owned a service station in Locksburg, Arkansas, noticed some vultures circling above his land. Checking his cows, he noticed that fossil bones were visible in a ditch near the road where some gravel had been removed recently for the reconstruction of Arkansas Highway 24. He removed them and for some months displayed the fossils in his station. At the time, nobody recognised them for dinosaur bones.McDonnold, Paul, 2014, \\"Them Dry Bones\\", Arkansas Life, September 2014, pp 80‚Äì85 A geology professor at the University of Arkansas and former resident of the nearby town of Nashville, Doy Zachry Jr., took the bones to his colleague at the University of Arkansas, paleontologist Dr. James H. Quinn, to view. Quinn recognized the fossilized remains as dinosaurian and prepared the bones. He took the remains to the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Lincoln, Nebraska in the fall of 1972. Once there, the bones were examined by experts from both the US and Europe. They were thought to be related to Ornithomimus. Quinn first presented on the fossils in 1973 at the Geological Society of America Meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas. In March 1973, Dr. Quinn and Benjamin Clardy of the Arkansas Geological Commission went to the area on the Friday farm where the remains had been discovered, hoping to find more remains. The site was a pit that had been dug for road construction and the fossils had been taken from the Early Cretaceous Trinity Group. Unfortunately, all the scientists were able to find was a toe bone. They speculated that the bones had either been scattered when they were buried or during the road construction. In all there were three metatarsals, four phalanges, and three claws found of Arkansaurus. Four casts of the bones were made. These casts were given to the Friday Family, the University of Arkansas, the Arkansas Geological Commission, and the Arkansas Museum of Science and Natural History. The University cast is hanging in a classroom in Ozark Hall. The Museum of Science and Natural History actually had a large statue of the dinosaur constructed to go along with their cast, and it was on display for many years when the museum was located at the Tower Building. The original bones, donated to the university by Friday, currently reside at the University of Arkansas Museum Collections, now housed at the Arkansas Archaeological Survey in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Quinn intended to name the species \\"Arkansaurus fridayi\\" but in 1977 made a fatal fall when prospecting for fossils in Nebraska. The name Arkansaurus first appeared in print in a popular-science book by Helen Roney Sattler in 1983,Sattler, H.R., 1983, The Illustrated Dinosaur Dictionary, New York: Lothrop, Lee, and Shepard Books NY, 315 pp. remaining an invalid nomen nudum. The full species name was first published by Angela K. Braden in 1998, mentioning that Quinn had informally used the combination \\"Arkansaurus fridayi\\".Braden, A.K., 1998, \\"The Arkansas dinosaur \\"Arkansaurus fridayi\\" \\", Brochure Arkansas Geological Commission In January 2017 Rep. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, submitted a bill to the Arkansas Legislature to designate Arkansaurus the State Dinosaur, along with several cosigners. The original idea of the bill came from high school student Mason Cypress Oury, who, accompanied by Rep. Leding, presented a modified version of the bill to a House panel, and answered questions. Among his reasoning for adopting the Arkansaurus as the state dinosaur Oury pointed out that Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri all have listed state dinosaurs, and Arkansas already has 24 designated state symbols, and since it was the 25th state to be admitted to the union, it made sense to add one more.Arkansas Online January 23, 2017 The bill was approved by the governor February 17, 2017. Arkansaurus was declared the official Arkansas state dinosaur in 2017.http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/2017R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=HCR1003 The dinosaur was discovered in Lockesburg, Arkansas, and was a bipedal ornithomimosaur dinosaur. A near relative is the ornithomimosaur Nedcolbertia. It is named for the state of Arkansas and its discoverer Joe B. Friday, who found the dinosaur's fossilized foot on his land in 1972. It is the only dinosaur fossil currently described from Arkansas. The fossil was officially described in 2018 by paleontologists ReBecca Hunt-Foster and James Harrison Quinn in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The official description of this dinosaur was published on March 19, 2018 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology by paleontologists ReBecca Hunt-Foster and, posthumously, James H. Quinn. The study determined that the fossils contain a combination of unique anatomical details, such as differentiated pedal unguals, a laterally compressed third metatarsal that is ovoid in proximal view, and a distal ungual with a very weak flexor tubercle, lacking spurs. The condition of this third metatarsal suggests that Arkansaurus fridayi is more basal than Asiatic ornithomimosaurs of similar age, but consistent with older North American forms, such as Nedcolbertia. Description Arkansaurus was probably a fast moving omnivore between tall. Its long arms would likely have ended in three fingered grasping hands. A single autapomorphy, unique derived trait, was indicated: the strong curvature of the foot claws. These are normally rather flat with ornithomimosaurians. Phylogeny Arkansaurus was placed in the Ornithomimosauria in a basal position, outside of the Ornithomimidae. Paleobiology Ornithomimisaur tracks of similar age are known from north of Moab, Utah, at the Mill Canyon Dinosaur Tracksite, in the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation (Early Cretaceous). This tracksite also preserves the tracks of ankylosaur, hadrosaur, sauropod and several size classes of theropod dinosaurs, along with crocodiles and birds. A similar fauna has been noted from the Trinity Group in Arkansas.

The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11, over a month after the traditional start of the season. The final named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Norma, dissipated on October 14. The Central Pacific Ocean saw very little tropical activity, with only one cyclone, Hurricane Keoni, developing in that particular region. However, many storms out of the season crossed the threshold into the Central Pacific, many as hurricanes, and even major hurricanes. The season produced fifteen named storms, which was slightly below the average of sixteen named storms per season. However, the total of eleven hurricanes during the season was slightly above average, and the total of nine major hurricanes was significantly higher than the average of three. The deadliest storm was Hurricane Calvin, which killed 37 people in Mexico.

Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h). The most intense cyclone of the season was Hurricane Lidia, a powerful Category 4 hurricane that made landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2. Killing seven people, Lidia also caused extensive property damage in Mexico and the United States, as the remnants of the system combined with a cold front to produce Severe weather in Texas. However, the most notable storm of the season, in terms of fatalities, was Hurricane Calvin. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on July 4, it reached a peak intensity of before making an initial landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. Rapidly weakening due to land interaction with the Mexican coastline, the hurricane re-emerged into Pacific waters, though the storm did not strengthen, and continued to weaken as it moved northwestward. On July 8, Calvin made a second, and final, landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula before weakening to a tropical depression and dissipating on July 9. At least 34 deaths can be attributed to the system, as well as $32 million (1993 USD) or more in damage. Systems =Hurricane Adrian= On June 11, an area of shower and thunderstorm activity situated approximately intensified into a tropical depression. Embedded within a weak steering flow, the depression initially drifted towards the west, and began to organize above high Sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Eighteen hours after formation, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name Adrian, and becoming the first tropical storm of the season. Turning towards the northwest, Adrian gradually strengthened to attain hurricane status by 1200 UTC on June 15, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of early the next day. However, the system turned clockwise towards the southeast, wind shear began to take toll on the cyclone, and Adrian weakened to a tropical storm early on June 17. Becoming nearly stationary, Adrian further weakened to a tropical depression late the same day, and dissipated at 1800 UTC on June 19, without any effects to land. =Tropical Storm Beatriz= On June 14, satellite imagery revealed an increase in thunderstorm activity to the south of the Gulf of Tehuanpec. Moving little, a broad surface low developed with the cloud mass, and a tropical wave moved through the area. Although the disturbance remained disorganized, a second tropical wave moved into the region on June 18, when the cloudiness there became better concentrated. According to a post-storm analysis of satellite data and synoptic reports, it is noted that a tropical depression formed at 0600 UTC on June 18, while located approximately south- southeast of Huatulco, Mexico. Quickly strengthening, the depression intensified a tropical storm six hours later based on a ship report, earning the name Beatriz. Moving generally towards the northwest, partially due to Tropical Storm Arlene's large circulation in the Gulf of Mexico, Beatriz reached a peak intensity of by 1800 UTC on June 19. Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall near Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca and rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Beatriz dissipated at 0600 UTC on June 20, although the remnant cloudiness and associated convection from the storm spread across portions of the western Gulf of Mexico that same day. Beatriz caused extensive damage in southwest Mexico, especially from heavy rains and flooding, with highest rainfall totals of between five and ten inches occurring in Oaxaca, with even higher totals of 11.97 in (304 mm) and 15.46 in (393 mm) from Las Pilas and Salina Cruz. Six deaths were reported in the Mexican states of Morelos and Veracruz from flooding and downed trees attributed to Beatriz. =Tropical Depression Three-E= On June 12, a tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa, and crossed the Atlantic Ocean with little to any development. Moving into the Pacific Ocean, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 00 UTC on June 27. Initially moving towards the northwest, the depression, referred to as Three-E, became slightly better organized as it neared the Mexican coastline. Twenty-four hours later, the depression was approximately off the coast of Mexico, near Puerto Escondidio. Shortly thereafter, the depression began to weaken, likely due to land interaction. Turning towards the west-northwest, the depression accelerated in its forward motion, while remaining in a disorganized state. Shortly thereafter, the Three-E turned back towards the northwest, and began to organize once again. Satellite imagery on June 30 revealed that the depression was close to tropical storm strength, although the system still lacked the organized to be declared as such. For the next several days, Three-E transitioned in movement between north and northwest, and by July 1, the depression approached Baja California. However, likely due to cooler sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear, most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated before it reached the southern portion of Baja California. At 00 UTC July 2, the depression dissipated a short distance north of La Paz. Shortly before the formation of Tropical Depression Three-E, it is reported that locally heavy rains fell over portions of the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco, where 24-hour rainfall totals of ,, and were reported, respectively. In Atoyac and Acapulco, 24-hour rainfall totals of and were reported. Additionally, between June 26 and June 29, Acapulco reported a 4-day rainfall total of . Lastly, according to an Associated Press wire story, 300 families were evacuated in Mexico, although a specific location is unknown. No deaths or damage was reported in association with the tropical depression. =Hurricane Calvin= The deadliest storm of the season, Hurricane Calvin, was first identified as an area of disturbed weather near the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 2\\\\. Following the development of banding features, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression two days later, while situated southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Quickly intensifying, the depression was soon named Calvin as it attained gale-force winds. After initially tracking westward, Calvin turned north and attained hurricane status before reinstating a westward component. Situated just off the coast of Mexico, Calvin attained its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on July 7 before moving ashore. Substantially disrupted by the interaction with land, the hurricane rapidly weakened before emerging back over water as a minimal system. Now a tropical depression, Calvin made its final landfall in Baja California Sur before dissipating over cold waters in the region. Following Calvin's closest approach, the Mexican Weather Service station in Manzanillo recorded a minimum barometric pressure of, as well as surface winds as the center of Calvin passed a little to the west. The Instituto Oceanografico del Pacifico in Manzanillo reported a minimum central pressure of . Only two other reports of tropical storm force winds were reported on the Mexican mainland, besides Manzanillo, were reported in associated with Calvin. In Calimo, sustained winds of were observed at 1300 UTC. Shortly thereafter, near 1545 UTC, sustained winds of with gusts up to were reported in the same location. Several ships reported rough weather during Calvin's existence, with the Pacific Sandpiper reporting a maximum wave height of . In Acapulco, it is reported that waves in excess of moved through the city. In several states, heavy rainfall between to inches was recorded. However, in Las Pilas, the highest rainfall total was observed, at . According to The Miami Herald and the West Hawaii Today, Calvin is blamed for the 34 deaths, which includes both direct and indirect. Most of the fatalities came from heavy rainfall associated with the system. A state of emergency was declared in at least ten states in Mexico following Calvin's passage, and the Mexican Defense Department said that 42,063 people were evacuated in eleven states. Additionally, at least 1,600 people were left homeless. Finally, rough seas near L√°zaro C√°rdenas caused all 4,000 tons of sulfuric acid to leak aboard the previously beached cargo tanker, Betula. =Hurricane Dora= On June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa and crossed the Atlantic with no further development. On July 9, the wave entered the Eastern Pacific, depicted with little in the way of heavy thunderstorm activity. However, on July 11, deep convection significantly increase in association with the disturbance, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed three days later, at 1200 UTC. Embedded within an area of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Dora, six hours after formation. Moving towards the west, Dora attained hurricane status at 1800 UTC on July 15, and Category 2 status by early on July 16. Strengthening further, Dora reached major hurricane status early the following morning, and reached its peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of early on July 17. Moving west to west-northwest around the periphery of a subtropical high, the hurricane began to enter cooler sea surface temperatures (SST's) and higher wind shear. Thus, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm by 1800 UTC on July 18. The following afternoon, Dora weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated early on July 21. No deaths, damage, or associated impact because of the system was reported to the National Hurricane Center. =Hurricane Eugene= A tropical wave traversed the Atlantic and Caribbean, before reaching the Pacific Ocean in mid-July. Following the development of a low- level circulation about south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Six-E on July 15\\\\. After banding features improved, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene on July 16\\\\. The storm continued to strengthen and organize, reaching hurricane status early on July 17\\\\. Eugene attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at 1800 UTC on July 19. After peak intensity, Eugene began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and decreasing SST's, and was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 22. Eugene crossed 140¬∞W on July 22 and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Eugene weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 24. At 1200 UTC on July 24, Eugene made landfall near Pahala, Hawaii, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). After a buoy near the path of Eugene reported no abnormal weather on July 25, Eugene was declared dissipated at 0600 UTC, while located just southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Eugene brought much-needed rain to the major Hawaiian Islands. The storm caused no significant damage, only scattered minor blackouts and breaking of tree limbs; roads were also dangerous to drive on. The only fatality in associated with Eugene was the death of a 45-year-old fisherman, who was killed when his boat was destroyed in rough seas. =Hurricane Keoni= An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression One-C at 0000 UTC on August 9, near 12¬∞N, 144¬∞W. The depression remained disorganized and strengthened slowly over the next three days. Late on August 12, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Keoni. Thereafter, it moved in a move west-northwesterly direction. Keoni intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by late on August 14\\\\. Less than 24 hours later, it reached Category 2 intensity. On August 18, Keoni peaked as a 130 mph (215 km/h) Category 4. The storm passed about south of Johnston Atoll on August 18\\\\. As Keoni approached, about 1000 people evacuated the atoll. It brought rough seas and because the storm was compact, wind gusts reached only . By August 17, Keoni began to weaken and fell to Category 3 intensity. Six hours later, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. Keoni further fell to a Category 1 hurricane on August 18\\\\. Late on the following day, Keoni crossed the International Date Line and was re-classified as a typhoon. =Hurricane Fernanda= Fernanda formed from a tropical wave that moved off the west African coast on July 28 and crossed into the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The developing storm reached tropical storm status on August 9 while 635 mi (1,022 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California, and Fernanda strengthened into a hurricane the next day. Fernanda developed a large and well-defined eye, reaching its peak of 145 mph (235 km/h) on August 12 over the open eastern Pacific. Fernanda eventually crossed into the central Pacific on August 14, and passed as close as 300 mi (483 km) northeast of the Big Island of Hawaii as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Fernanda later began to curve slowly to the northwest on August 16 under the influence of an upper- level trough after approaching the Hawaiian Islands, becoming extratropical on August 19 after weakening due to shear and cooler waters, with the remnant circulation merging with the cold upper-level trough. Although it did not make landfall in the Hawaiian Islands, Fernanda's close approach prompted a hurricane warning for the Big Island and a hurricane watch elsewhere in the islands. Heavy surf and wave action affected the islands, with waves as high as between 15 (5 m) and 20 ft (6 m) reported on Kauai, causing damage to shoreline roads on all of the islands, allowing water intrusion into some homes, and washing one home several feet off its foundation. Many beach parks were also inundated, though evacuations prevented any deaths. In total, Fernanda caused $5 million (1993 USD, $ USD) in damage to the Hawaiian Islands, and moisture induced by the interaction of Fernanda and the cold-core trough also affected the islands, producing showers and thunderstorms on all of the islands and localized flooding on Kauai. =Hurricane Greg= On August 10, Tropical Storm Bret made landfall in Nicaragua with maximum sustained winds of . Moving quickly inland, Bret weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Central America. Moving off towards west, convection associated with the remnant area of cloudiness developed in intermittent bursts, but by August 14, a more steady trend of development was observed. While centered south-southeast of Manzanillo, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed around 0000 UTC August 15. According to the National Hurricane Center, satellite imagery on the 15th revealed a much better organized system than twenty-four hours previous, and the depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC, receiving the name Greg. Turning towards the west-northwest, the system continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status at 1200 UTC on August 16. At this time, hints of an eye feature was observable on satellite imagery. Rapid intensification then ensued, and Greg became a strong Category 2 hurricane by 1800 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of as a small and fairly well-defined eye became visible. However, shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured from view, an indication that Greg was on a weakening trend. A slowdown in forward motion occurred, and Greg turned towards the west before moving west- southwest, towards the general direction of Socorro Island. =Hurricane Hilary= The third in a series of intense August hurricanes, Hilary originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on August 14\\\\. By August 17, just three days after entering the Eastern Pacific, the wave was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Nine-E. Tracking westward, the depression gradually developed, attaining hurricane status two days later. By this time, a ridge situated over the Gulf of Mexico caused Hilary to turn northwestward, parallel to the Mexican coastline. Following the development of an 18 mi (29 km) wide eye on August 21, the storm further intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). By August 23, the hurricane nearly stalled as it underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with the newly developed Tropical Storm Irwin. Executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary degraded to tropical storm intensity and took a northerly track for the remainder of its existence. The storm made two landfalls in Mexico, one in Baja California Sur on August 25 and again near Hermosillo, Sonora the following day. The remnants of Hilary were last noted over the northern Gulf of California on August 27. Due to Hilary's proximity to Mexico on August 20, hurricane watches were issued for much of the southern coastline; however, they were later discontinued. Once the system began its northward track, further advisories were issued for the Baja California Peninsula as well as the Gulf of California coastline. Heavy rains, peaking at , accompanied the storm, though no damage or loss of life took place. The outer bands of the storm also brought localized downpours to parts of California, resulting in flash floods. =Tropical Storm Irwin= On August 20, convection increased south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, when a tropical wave, which is likely responsible for Tropical Storm Cindy's in the Atlantic, moved into the region. Satellite imagery on August 21 revealed an increase in organization associated with the disturbance, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 0600 UTC. Six hours later, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm after a surface wind was reported by the ship BT Nestor. Receiving the name Irwin, the system moved off towards the northwest, displaying a rather disorganized cloud appearance. Additionally, most satellite wind estimates never topped , with the exception being a estimate from the Air Force Global Weather Center at 0427 UTC on August 22. At 2100 UTC on August 21, tropical storm warnings issued from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes, Mexico in anticipation of the storm's arrival. Despite the system's disorganized cloud appearance, combined observations from nearby ships, as well as a report from Manzanillo, Mexico, reveals Irwin's maximum sustained winds may have been as high as with a minimum barometric pressure of , which was set as the storm's peak intensity at 00 UTC on August 22. Paralleling the southern Mexican coastline, Irwin quickly weakened as it began to be absorbed by Hurricane Hilary. By 1800 UTC on August 22, Irwin was fully absorbed by Hurricane Hilary, when the hurricane was situated west of Irwin. At this time, all tropical storm warnings were discounted for the Mexican coastline. While located to the south of Manzanillo, the cyclone generated sustained winds of in the city, as well as a minimum pressure of . At the same time, winds of were reported in the Manzanillo harbor by Peter Maxwell, an owner of the hotel at the time, although, according to the National Hurricane Center, these winds were likely overestimated. In Jala, a maximum rainfall total of was recorded. No deaths or associated damage was reported with the system. =Hurricane Jova= On August 14, a tropical wave moved off the east coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The wave moved westward, eventually entering the eastern Pacific Ocean. On August 26, signs of a circulation developing began to appear. The circulation gradually became better defined, and on August 29, the wave became a tropical depression while about 125 nautical miles south of the coast of Mexico. The depression moved northwestward, paralleling the coast of Mexico, becoming Tropical Storm Jova at 18:00 UTC. Early on August 31, Jova strengthened into a hurricane and shortly afterward began to rapidly intensify, reaching its peak intensity with sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) at 06:00 UTC on September 1. Afterward, the eye of the hurricane became clouded and ill-defined, resulting in a swift weakening trend that brought it to minimal hurricane strength on September 2. Jova briefly reintensified on September 3, but began weakening once again afterward. Early on September 4, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, and then to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC. Finally, at 00:00 UTC on September 6, Jova became a remnant low while well west of the Baja Peninsula. Because Jova remained offshore, no damage or deaths occurred as a result of the hurricane. The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall in southern Mexico, with no reported impact. =Hurricane Kenneth= On August 30, a cloud cluster just to the south of Panama was observed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Moving towards the west for several days, the disturbance remained relatively disorganized, but was classified as a tropical depression of 1200 UTC on September 5, after Satellite analysts at the NESDIS Synoptic Analysis Branch (SAB) and the NHC Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast (TSAF) unit classified the disturbance as a T1.5 by the Dvorak Technique at the time. Additionally, satellite imagery showed a typical banding type pattern, although the associated convection was loosely organized. However, by 0600 UTC September 6, convection had become more intense and better organized. Subsequently, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kenneth, while situated south of the southern tip of Baja California. At this time, a large circulation associated with Kenneth was evident, with the ship Silvie III reporting sustained winds, which was positioned away from the storm's center. On September 7, deep convection began to markedly increase near the center of circulation, and it estimated that Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 8. Continuing to strengthen, Kenneth attained Category 2 status at 0600 UTC on September 10, characterized by a distinct eye, and strengthened further to attain major hurricane status six hours later. Moving towards the northwest, Kenneth attained Category 4 status at 1800 UTC, and reached a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of at 0600 UTC on September 11. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken as high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures began to impede on the storm. Kenneth weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early on September 12, and a Category 2 hurricane by 1800 UTC. Moving towards the west-northwest, Kenneth became a minimal hurricane late on September 14, and weakened further to tropical storm status at 00 UTC on September 15. The system weakened to a tropical depression on September 16, and finally, after thirteen days as a tropical cyclone, Kenneth dissipated in the open Pacific, without any effects to land. =Hurricane Lidia= Forming from a tropical wave on September 8, Lidia steadily organized and became a hurricane on September 10. The hurricane continued to strengthen while developing a well-defined eye, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on September 11. However, it weakened considerably before making landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2 storm. Lidia dissipated near Austin, Texas on September 14 and was later absorbed by a cold front. Across Mexico, the hurricane killed seven people; over 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes. A total of 160 homes were destroyed and 10,000 people were left homeless because of the storm. In the United States, five people suffered injuries and storm damage totaled $8 million (1993 USD). =Tropical Depression Fourteen-E (Gert)= Moving across the mountainous terrain of mainland Mexico, Atlantic Hurricane Gert quickly weakened to a tropical depression upon its emerge into the Pacific, where it was reclassified as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. Initially moving towards the west, and eventually towards the west-northwest, it is possible that the depression could have been close to tropical storm status before turning towards the southwest, west of the southern tip of Baja California. Deep convection began to decrease on September 24, and two days later, the depression dissipated. There are no reports of deaths or damage associated with Tropical Depression Fourteen-E, although its processor caused many deaths and extensive damage in Mexico. =Tropical Storm Max= An area of convection, probably associated with a tropical wave from the Atlantic, strengthened a tropical depression at 00 UTC on September 30. Continuing to organize, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later, earning the name Max. However, shortly thereafter, strong wind shear removed convection from atop Max's low- level center, and the system weakened to a tropical depression. As a large upper-level anticyclone began to extend towards the west, the storm wind shear affecting Max resided, and it is estimated that the system reattained tropical storm status late on October 1, as deep convection redeveloped in associated with the cyclone. At 00 on October 2, Max reached its peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of . Embedded within a region of weak steering currents, Max meandered for a couple of days while weakening. The system was once again downgraded to a tropical depression during the afternoon hours of October 3, and was later absorbed by a larger Tropical Storm Norma by 00 UTC on October 4. Because the system strayed far from land, no deaths, damage, or effects to land were reported. =Tropical Storm Norma= On September 29, a large area of disturbed weather was first identified a few hundred miles to the south of Acapulco. Gradually organizing, the disturbance developed a closed, low-level center of circulation on October 2, and subsequently, was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC, while centered south of the southern tip of Baja California. Embedded within a region of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression quickly intensified to attain tropical storm status at 1200 UTC October 3, earning the name Norma. Moving towards the northwest, Norma attained a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of early on October 4. At this time, the smaller Max was absorbed into Norma's circulation, and the storm moved into an area of southwesterly upper-level flow. Subsequently, Norma began to weaken, and its low-level center became exposed to the southwest of the system's deep convection late on October 4. Weakening to a tropical depression at 00 UTC on October 5, Norma drifted towards the northwest as a swirl of low clouds, and dissipated during the afternoon hours of October 6, without any fatalities, damage, or effects to land. =Tropical Depression Seventeen-E= On October 11, the last tropical cyclone of the 1993 season developed several hundred miles to the southeast of Baja California. Under seemingly favorable conditions, the depression moved northwest and strengthened slightly to reach a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the depression began to enter cooler sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear, subsequently dissipating at 00 UTC on October 14, without any effects on land. =Other systems= According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on August 11 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and soon exited CPHC's area of responsibility. According to the JTWC, on October 12 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and 3 days later exited CPHC's area of responsibility. As it entered into western Pacific, it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name Hattie. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1993. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1999 season. This is the same list used for the 1987 season with the exception of Kenneth, which replaced Knut and was used to name a storm for the first time in 1993. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Adrian * Beatriz * Calvin * Dora * Eugene * Fernanda * Greg * Hilary  * Irwin * Jova * Kenneth * Lidia * Max * Norma * *    * * } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.

Early life Pearce grew up in Leyton, Essex, and was apparently a bright child. At the age of 11, he went to Nelson House preparatory school in Oxford and his parents hoped that this would be their son's key to a better life. But they were unable to pay the fees, and three years later he came back to the family home and attended Norlington Boys' School in Leyton. Pearce attended there for two years before leaving, at age 16, to go into the advertising industry. Mardi Gra bombings After a dispute with Barclays Bank, Pearce targeted six different branches on 6 December 1994 with home-made bombs. Two of them, in Hampstead and Ladbroke Grove, exploded, injuring two members of staff. From May 1995, Pearce was randomly sending bombs to different targets and addresses, including one to the Barclaycard headquarters in Northampton with a blackmail demand. In 1996 he targeted Barclays banks again, exploding two devices in the Ealing branch and one in Eltham from January to April. Three civilian injuries were caused by the last one in Ealing on 20 April. After 17 months of inactivity, Pearce resumed his blackmailing and bombing campaign, this time targeting Sainsbury's supermarkets, in the hope of obtaining money from them. He targeted five branches in November 1997 in the west and south- east London. A 73-year-old woman accidentally picked up a device left in West Ealing with her shopping. His last attack was in Eltham, south-east London, on 17 April 1998. In total, he planted 36 devices. At the time he was unemployed and divorced, living in the affluent Chiswick area of west London. Police believed the suspect was acting alone and possibly influenced by Ted Kaczynski, who was being sentenced in America at the time. On 28 April 1998, Pearce was arrested in Whitton, south-west London, after falling into a police trap whilst withdrawing cash, as his account was linked and being watched by the police. At his Chiswick home, police found home-made bombs. His terror campaign cost Sainsbury's ¬£640,000 in lost trade. Lawyers acting for Pearce claimed he suffers from Binswanger's disease, a rare form of dementia that can change the way people think. But following further medical reports, the judges at the Old Bailey rejected this. On 14 April 1999, he was convicted of 20 charges including causing an explosion, possessing firearms and wounding, and was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment.ref name=guardian-mardi-gra-bomber-is- jailed-for-224-years/> Pearce was labeled the Mardi Gra bomber because he often left a calling card containing the phrase \\"Welcome to the Mardi Gra experience\\".

The season also produced the second-highest ACE value on record in the basin, only surpassed by the 2018 season. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, these bounds were easily exceeded when Hurricane Ekeka formed on January 28 and again a couple months later with Tropical Storm Hali. The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki, which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands, primarily in Kauai, along with six casualties. Hurricanes Lester, Virgil, Winifred, and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people, but were significantly less destructive. Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico, without making landfall. Hurricane Tina was, in addition to being the strongest storm of the year, the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and north-central Pacific Ocean. However, the season wildly exceeded these bounds, as climatological effects including an El Ni√±o caused Hurricane Ekeka to form on January 26. It is also the only known time that multiple cyclones had formed before the season began. During the season, twenty-seven tropical cyclones formed in the Eastern Pacific (east of longitude 140¬∞W), and twenty-four developed further and became tropical storms. Both of these figures constitute records in the basin, as the 1992 season surpassed the season with the most tropical cyclones (1982, 26) and the season with the most named storms (1985, 22). Of these, fourteen reached hurricane strength and eight became major hurricanes‚Äîstorms that reach Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This season had five storms reach tropical storm intensity or higher in the month of October, the only time that had happened in this basin. In addition, Hurricanes or Tropical Storms Winifred through Zeke are the earliest twenty-first through twenty-fourth named storms in a season in the eastern north Pacific. The Central Pacific (between 140¬∞W and the International Date Line) saw similarly high levels of activity. Eleven tropical cyclones were tracked by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center throughout the hurricane season. Of those, eight developed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific, and three formed within the basin. Two of the storms strengthened to major hurricane status within the Central Pacific's boundaries. One of the crossover storms, Iniki, crossed into the basin as a tropical depression, strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane, and made landfall in Hawaii, becoming the most destructive hurricane in the state's history. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. The figures in parentheses are for storms in the Central Pacific basin west of 140¬∞W; those not in parentheses are for the Eastern Pacific basin. This season had the highest ACE of any season on record at the time, with an overall value of 295.492, until it was surpassed by the 2018 season. Systems =Hurricane Ekeka= The first storm of the season developed from an area of disturbed weather near Kiritimati in the Line Islands. The tropical disturbance had been tracked since January 23, and at 0600 UTC January 28, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system as Tropical Depression One-C. This was unusual, since the system was located well to the south of the area of normal tropical cyclone formation, further south than any other Pacific hurricane at the time, and the formation occurred well outside the climatological bounds of the hurricane season. The system intensified and reached tropical storm status 12 hours later, at which point it became known as Ekeka. The system continued intensifying until reaching hurricane status at 0000 UTC on January 30, and it reached major hurricane status on February 2, reaching maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, unfavorable wind shear began taking a toll on the storm, causing it to rapidly weaken. Ekeka crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk, before dissipating on February 9 about 310 mi (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. =Tropical Storm Hali= In late March, meteorological conditions similar to what allowed Ekeka to develop persisted in the central Pacific. An area of convection organized into Tropical Depression Two-C, just north of 5ÀöN, atypically close to the equator, and far to the southwest of Hawaii. Moving west-northwestward, it slowly intensified, intensifying into a tropical storm on March 29\\\\. Upon doing so, the CPHC gave it the name Hali. Later that day, the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), before increased southwesterly wind shear imparted weakening. Hali was downgraded to a tropical depression on March 30, and it dissipated shortly thereafter. It never affected land. Hali is notable as being the only known Pacific tropical cyclone east of the dateline to develop in the month of March. =Tropical Storm Agatha= On May 26, a tropical wave moved off the Central America, which began to show signs of organization on May 29. Early on June 1, the NHC classified it as a tropical depression while located southwest of Acapulco. Based on a combination of ship data and Dvorak intensity estimates, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2. Agatha steered toward the north while steadily intensifying. Around 1800 UTC June 2, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). Maintaining its peak intensity for 30 hours, Agatha gradually decelerated as it passed within southwest of the Mexican coast. The center of the storm promptly became less defined on June 3, simultaneously recurving to the west. By 0600 UTC June 5, the storm was downgraded back into tropical depression status prior to dissipating the next day. Agatha approached close enough to the coast of Mexico that watches and warnings were issued. An estimated 1,500 people were evacuated due to the storms' approach. Waves up to were reported along the coast of Mexico and torrential rains triggered flash flooding resulting in ten fatalities. =Tropical Storm Blas= A tropical wave crossed Central America from June 14-16. The system entered the Eastern Pacific basin without much convection. The northward portion of the wave developed a circulation in the mid-levels of the atmosphere, and despite moving over waters marginally suitable for cyclogenesis, the tropical wave organized into the fourth depression of the season on June 22 as deep convection developed near the center. At this time, the system was located south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Early on June 23, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Blas. Although the storm developed an impressive upper-level outflow and well- organized thunderstorm activity and was moving into an area sea surface temperatures of , the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast only slight intensification. Water vapor imagery also suggested that strong wind shear would introduce a weakening trend, and later that day, Blas weakened accordingly back into a depression, and dissipated at 0:00 UTC June 24. =Hurricane Celia= Celia formed from tropical wave that crossed over into the East Pacific basin around June 19. Dvorak Classifications were initiated on June 21, and a circulation developed the next day. The system was classified as a tropical depression while located west of Guatemala based on ship reports. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the storm formed further east than most Pacific hurricanes due to little wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures near Central America. Due to these conditions, meteorologists at the NHC were anticipating steady intensification. Although the storm initially appeared ragged on weather satellite imagery, the storm intensified into Tropical Storm Celia on 18:00 UTC June 23 as banding features improved. By the evening of June 24, Celia had developed a large area of convection near the center, and the NHC re-assessed the intensity at 65 mph (100 km/h). The storm was also forecast to become a moderate Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. Several hours later, Celia was upgraded into a hurricane based on intensity estimates via Dvorak Technique. Celia's rate of intensification accelerated and thus underwent a period of rapid deepening. Overnight, the storm developed an excellent upper-level outflow and very cold cloud tops. Late on June 25, an eye appeared, and the NHC classified the storm as a strong Category 1 hurricane. By midday June 26, Celia intensified into a Category 2 hurricane A well-defined eye soon developed, and the storm was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane later that day. Early on June 27, Celia became a Category 4 major hurricane with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimal pressure of . Celia maintained Category 4 intensity for about 24 hours and then started to gradually weaken. Late on June 28, Celia's eye became somewhat ragged, and the storm fluctuated in intensity over the next several days. At 00:00 UTC June 29, Celia weakened to winds of 85 mph (130 km/h). The system briefly re-intensified into a moderate Category 2 hurricane, but later resumed the weakening trend. Celia fell below hurricane status on 00:00 UTC July 2. Turing northwest, the tropical cyclone weakened back to tropical depression status the next day. Thereafter, Celia degenerated into a tight low to mid-level swirl of low-convection clouds that dissipated July 4. =Hurricane Darby= A tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Five-E on July 2. It strengthened and was named Darby the next day. Due to very strong steering currents, Darby accelerated as it paralleled the coast of Mexico, and the system strengthened into a hurricane on July 5 while also substantially increasing in size. Darby peaked as a strong Category 3 on July 6, before it began to steadily weaken thereafter as it passed over cooler waters. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on July 8 and to a depression the next day. Tropical Depression Darby lost all tropical characteristics on July 10, but moisture from Darby's remnants eventually spread over parts of the continental United States. During Darby's formation, flooding from the cyclone's rainbands killed three people in Acapulco, where 180 shops were damaged. Four fishermen were reported missing, fate unknown. Manzanillo, Colima, reported sustained winds just above tropical-storm force. The hurricane's remnants brought mainly light rain to the U.S. state of California. Cloud cover also delayed the landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for one day. South-facing beaches of that state were pounded with waves up to 7 feet (2.3 m) in height. A monetary value for damage is not available. Darby also caused a few shipping accidents. A pleasure craft, the Oasis, had an engine failure and was abandoned. The seven people aboard were rescued, but the boat was sunk. A smaller sailboat, the Hosanna, had difficulties but was towed to a safe location by a cutter from the United States Coast Guard. A fishing boat at an unspecified location also experienced difficulties. =Hurricane Estelle= The origins of Hurricane Estelle were from a tropical wave that began on June 23 off the African coast. After passing over northern South America, a large area of disturbed weather formed about west of Acapulco on July 9 and was classified as a tropical depression two days later. Eighteen hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Estelle as banding features increased. Gradually intensifying, the storm's outflow improved, and a burst of deep convection occurred over the center. Early on July 10, an eye developed, and based on this, Estelle was upgraded into a hurricane. Around that time, Estelle turned to the northwest. Although the eye briefly disappeared from satellite imagery later that day, a small and distinct eye quickly re-formed within very deep convection, and Estelle was respectively upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane. Later on July 11, the NHC reported that Estelle had intensified into a major hurricane. A few hours later, Estelle was upgraded into a Category 4 system as the storm continued to rapidly deepen. Moving northwestward due to interaction with a trough, Estelle began a weakening trend. By the afternoon, Estelle was downgraded into a Category 3 system. At 0000 UTC, winds fell below major hurricane force, only to re-intensify back to a major hurricane hours later. Hurricane Estelle quickly re-developed a well-defined eye and an impressive upper-level outflow and Estelle attained its peak intensity of 140 mph (230 km/h). However, the next day the thunderstorms around the eye began to warm. The storm gradually weakened over the next few days as it encountered cooler waters. By early on July 14, Hurricane Estelle was re-classified as a Category 3 hurricane, and shortly afterwards, winds fell below major hurricane strength several hundred miles west of the Baja California Peninsula. Turning west under shallow low- level steering currents, Estelle weakened into a tropical storm on July 15. It weakened into a tropical storm the next day. On 0800 UTC July 17, Tropical Depression Estelle had dissipated over west of Baja California Sur. =Hurricane Frank= The origins of Hurricane Frank were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on July 1\\\\. After reaching the Pacific, it developed an area of disturbed weather on July 9 off the southern Mexican coast. Continuing westward, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on July 13 about 660 mi (1070 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The depression intensified with favorable water temperatures and well-defined outflow. Based on estimates from satellite imagery, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank on July 14. For about a day, the storm tracked generally northwestward before turning to the west due to a building ridge north of the system. An eye developed within the Central Dense Overcast, a large mass of deep convection, late on July 14\\\\. Additional intensification was expected, and Frank was predicted to become a major hurricane within 48 hours. The next day, Frank attained hurricane status. Late on July 15, Hurricane Frank passed about 175 mi (280 km) south of Socorro Island. A station on the island reported winds of 67 mph (107 km/h), which indicated that the hurricane had a large wind field. Slow intensification continued, and Frank intensified into a major hurricane, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, on July 17. By that time, the eye had become well-defined, and later became surrounded by a ring of deep convection. On July 18, Frank reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) well to the west-southwest of the Baja California peninsula. By July 20, winds dropped below major hurricane intensity, and by the evening, Frank was just a Category 1 hurricane. Afterward, the hurricane turned northwestward over progressively cooler water temperatures, resulting in weakening. On July 21 Frank was downgraded to a tropical storm, after wind shear caused further weakening. The next day, it crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, with winds at the time of crossing over were estimated at 50 mph (85 km/h). Rapidly declining in strength, it weakened to a tropical depression on July 23\\\\. Later that day Frank dissipated about 800 mi (650 km) northeast of Hawaii. =Hurricane Georgette= A tropical wave left Africa in early July and crossed the Atlantic without development. It crossed into the eastern Pacific on July 13, and organized into Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 14. The system was located over warm waters, and moving west- northwest, the depression paralleled the coast of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Georgette on July 15. About 18 hours later, Georgette became a minimal hurricane after deep convection developed over the center. During its formative stages, Georgette brought higher than average humidity to California. The hurricane turned westward due to a ridge to the north, but a west-northwest track later resumed. On July 18, Georgette reached a peak of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum pressure of , although the NHC operationally estimated peak winds of . Shortly after its peak, the eye became less defined, only intermittently seen on satellite imagery. After wind shear increased, Georgette weakened for about two days, and on July 20 a ridge forced the hurricane southwestward. Similar to hurricanes Celia and Estelle earlier this season, Georgette re-intensified once it turned back toward the west and it regained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on July 21. Although meteorologists predicted the storm to intensify into a major hurricane, this did not occur. Strong upper-level winds weakened Georgette back to a tropical storm early on July 23. About 30 hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression, devoid of deep convection, and shortly thereafter entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Moving quickly westward, Georgette had difficulty maintaining a closed atmospheric circulation, and it dissipated late on July 26\\\\. Around that time, the system was south of Hawaii, and it brought locally gusty winds as high as to the northern part of the Big Island. Several large waterspouts were sighted early on July 26 off of a beach in the south Kohala district. Georgette's remnants later produced squally weather at Johnston Atoll. The remnants moved across the International Dateline into the western Pacific on July 29, and was still a weak tropical disturbance when it moved past Wake Island at the end of the month. =Tropical Storm Howard= On July 26 a tropical depression formed and became a weak tropical storm the next day. It steadily organized, ad reached it peak intensity as a strong tropical storm. It then began to weaken, despite being located over warm waters. Howard dissipated several days later without affecting land. =Tropical Storm Isis= Isis formed on July 28 as a depression and became a tropical storm the next day. Isis peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds on July 30. Due to cooler water, it weakened to a depression on the first and dissipated the next day. Isis degenerated to a broad area of low pressure on August 2. =Hurricane Javier= Hurricane Javier probably originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on July 17. While it showed some signs of organization off the west coast of Africa, most of the convection dissipated by time it was near the Lesser Antilles. Around the time it entered the Pacific on July 27, thunderstorm activity increased and became more concentrated. By July 30, the cloud pattern began to organize, though it was initially elongated. Moving westward, the system was declared a tropical depression on 1800 UTC July 30. Initially, the depression developed slowly and there was even uncertainty on whether it had an atmospheric circulation or not. It was not until 1200 UTC August 2 when the system was finally upgraded into a tropical storm. Around this time, Javier turned west- northwest, a direction it would maintain for days when a ridge north of the cyclone caused it turn to the west, and later, west-southwest. Shortly after turning west, Javier intensified into a hurricane. By 0000 UTC August 6, Hurricane Javier had attained peak wind speeds of . After hanging on to hurricane strength for a day, Javier rapidly lost deep convection and become much less organized. By August 7, winds were only . However, the weakening rate slowed somewhat once Javier before it moved CPhC's AOR on August 8. Tropical Storm Javier continued to diminish in strength while moving west- southwest. On August 9, the CHPC reported that Javier had weakened into a tropical depression. By 0000 UTC August 12, Javier had dissipated south of Hawaii. As a dissipating tropical depression, some rainfall and showers were recorded along the Hawaiian islands. =Tropical Depression Twelve-E= Twelve-E had a peak windspeed of 35 mph (55 km/h), and a pressure of . It formed on August 10, and dissipated on August 13. =Tropical Storm Kay= A depression formed on August 18. It became a tropical storm shortly after forming and was named Kay. Kay was a short lived system. Its peak intensity was only . However, Kay was a very small tropical storm. It dissipated on August 22. Kay never impacted land. =Hurricane Lester= Tropical Depression Fourteen-E formed on August 20 from a tropical wave that began to show signs of organized on August 19. At the time of the upgrade, it was located about 275 miles (445 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo. The depression slowly strengthened and steadily organized attained tropical storm status late on August 20. The next day, Lester turned to the north. Lester intensified into a hurricane late on August 22 while located about 240 miles (385 km) west of La Paz. The hurricane continued to organize and Lester attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 23 before making landfall as a minimal hurricane near Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur. After passing through the northern Gulf of California, it made a second landfall in the state of Sonora as a tropical storm. Lester entered Arizona as a tropical storm on August 24, the first time since 1967 that a Pacific hurricane entered the United States as a tropical storm. The low-level circulation subsequently dissipated over New Mexico, though the remnants transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and subsequently merged with the remnants of Hurricane Andrew and another frontal system on August 29. Hurricane Lester produced heavy rainfall across its path with a peak rainfall occurring in Mulege. Extensive flood damage was reported west of Hermosillo. A large highway was damaged and many communities were destroyed. Flash flooding from Lester caused 10,000 people to be evacuated from their homes. In addition, mudslides killed three people, and left 5,000 homeless. The remnants of Lester produced heavy rainfall across the Southwestern United States causing flash flooding of arroyos and moderate flooding in Denver. Snowfall from the storm generated traffic problems in mountainous areas. The remnants of Lester extended through the eastern United States, resulting in rainfall records in Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, and North Dakota. In all, Hurricane Lester resulted in $3 million (1992 USD) in damage. =Tropical Storm Madeline= Far in the open ocean, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 27. Banding and convection increased, and the depression became a tropical storm the next day. Development continued, and Madeline peaked with a minimum pressure of , and winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), on August 29. As the system progressed westward, it entered a region of strong wind shear and had dissipated on August 31. The system never came near land. =Tropical Storm Newton= Newton was a fairly short-lived storm. It formed from a tropical wave on August 27. It became a tropical storm, was named Newton 18 hours later, and dissipated four days later on August 31. Newton never impacted any land. =Hurricane Orlene= Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed September 2, rapidly intensifying to a tropical storm the next day, then a Category 1 hurricane late that day. Orlene peaked at Category 4 major hurricane status on September 6. The system held intensity for a day or so, with gradual weakening due to shear over the area, but the shear relaxed over the cyclone early on September 9, which brought about a quick restrengthening phase on September 9, although it stopped, and the weakening trend resumed later that day. Orlene weakened back to a tropical storm on September 10, and finally a depression on September 12, around the same time that it moved into the Central Pacific. It dissipated two days later, on September 14, after making landfall as a tropical depression on the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants caused downpours and washed out roads, and the damage was minimal, though some areas got up to of rain. =Hurricane Iniki= Forming on September 5 about 1,700 miles (2,700 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until September 8, when it strengthened into a tropical storm. Having been designated in the Central Pacific, the storm was given the name Iniki. Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470 miles (760 km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south- southwest of the island chain. As Iniki turned to the north, it continued to strengthen, reaching a peak of 145 mph (235 km/h) winds on September 11 while 170 miles (270 km) south-southwest of Kauai. It continued rapidly to the north-northeast, and made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. After crossing the island, Iniki weakened rapidly, and became extratropical on September 13 about halfway between Alaska and Hawaii. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance as the CPHC forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain until September 10, less than 24 hours before landfall that any warning was given to the public. Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oahu. Hurricane Iniki's high winds caused extensive damage in Kauai. 1,421 houses were completely destroyed, and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action. A total of 5,152 homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. Iniki's high winds also downed 26.5% of the island's transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800-mile (1300 km) distribution wire system. Some areas were without power for up to three months after the storm. More than 7,000 people were homeless after the storm's passage. One person died when struck by debris, while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her. Offshore, two humans died when their boat capsized. More than 100 injuries can be attributed to Iniki. Upon passing by Oahu, Iniki produced tides of 1.7‚Äì3 feet (0.5‚Äì0.9 m) above normal. Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oahu. In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage, and two deaths on Oahu. Overall, Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $3.1 billion in damage. In all, Iniki also was responsible for 6 deaths. During the aftermath of the storm, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help. though military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs. Amateur radio proved to be helpful during the three weeks after the storm, with volunteers coming from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery. Local operators assisted with the American Red Cross to provide disaster relief centers across Kauai. Many insurance companies left Hawaii after the storm, forcing Hawaii to launch a Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaii residents, but it was stopped in 2000. =Hurricane Paine= The tropical wave from which Paine originated moved off the coast of Africa on August 25, reaching the Caribbean on September 2, and eventually crossed Central America and the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The wave finally reached the Pacific on September 8, developing a mid-level circulation a short distance south of Manzanillo. The circulation finally organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Nineteen-E early on September 11, a couple hundred miles southwest of Baja California. The depression continued just south of due west for the next couple of days, under the influence of a deep-layer-mean anticyclone. The depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Paine around 1800 UTC on the September 11. Gradually intensifying, the storm approached hurricane intensity early on September 13. Upon the formation of an eye, Paine attained hurricane status. Meanwhile, the storm reached its peak intensity of 75 mph (120 km/h), a mid- level Category 1 hurricane. Paine then slowed to a forward speed of only , while executing a slow, erratic clockwise loop for the next three days. The loop was initially caused by an approaching trough, but was later caused by Paine's proximity to the approaching Hurricane Roslyn from the east. By 1800 UTC September 14, Paine weakened back to a tropical storm. By September 16, Paine had dissipated. The remnants of Hurricane Paine were later absorbed into Roslyn's larger circulation. =Hurricane Roslyn= On September 13, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-E, about south of Baja California. Despite initial disorganization, the system developed an eye-like feature the next day and was named Tropical Storm Roslyn, the storm also began to develop banding features, concurrent with the better establishment of upper-level outflow. Roslyn quickly intensified to just below hurricane status on the September 15, but began a short weakening trend, as it passed through the wake of Hurricane Paine, where it had begun intensifying on the 11th. By 1800 UTC that day, Roslyn began interacting with the weakening and nearby Paine, with centers of both systems being only a few hundred miles apart, and with this interaction, Paine was absorbed into Roslyn the next day, although this merger didn't affect Roslyn's intensity in the least. On the September 18, Roslyn had a brief period of strengthening. By September 21, deep convection began to rapidly increase, followed by a visible eye on satellite imagery the next day, which indicated that Roslyn had reached hurricane intensity. The hurricane peaked at moderate Category 2 status later on the September 22, with a quick decrease in strength thereafter. Roslyn was downgraded to a tropical storm just as it crossed into the Central Pacific two days later, and over the next several days, a trough to the west turned the weakening Roslyn to the northeast, and then to the north. The system finally dissipated on September 30, over two weeks after it formed. =Hurricane Seymour= On September 17, a tropical wave was upgraded into a tropical depression. The next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Seymour a couple hundred miles south of the southern tip of Baja California, and while continuing on a west-northwest and northwest track, Seymour reached hurricane strength on September 19. However, the system soon weakened to a tropical storm, due to the effects of a trough producing moderate shear, and cooler waters. This was short-lived. The trough soon moved out of the area and was replaced by a ridge, which steered Seymour to the west, and allowed it to regain hurricane status on the September 23, while Seymour had developed a broad and clear eye. However, Seymour only held hurricane intensity for a short period of time, and by that night, it had already weakened back to a tropical storm. After losing a significant amount of deep convection, it weakened to a depression two days later. Tropical Depression Seymour finally dissipated on September 27. Seymour never affected land, and no damage or deaths were reported. =Hurricane Tina= Tina was the strongest storm of the season and threatened land for a time. It formed from a tropical wave on September 17. It moved glacially towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane. A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then recurved Tina to the northeast and towards land, still moving slowly and gradually slowing down. The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge. Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea. It intensified into a Category 4 storm with a central pressure of . Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north. The stubborn Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11, shortly after entering the central Pacific. Similar to Hurricane Isabel, Tina displayed annular characteristics. Due to its erratic track and slow motion, Tina was alive from September 17 to October 11‚Äî a span of 24 days. This is the record for the eastern Pacific Ocean, smashing the east/central record of 20 days held by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season and surpassing Typhoon Rita's west Pacific 1972 record. It was itself surpassed just two years later by Hurricane John. =Hurricane Virgil= On October 1, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Three-E, a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast. Despite weak shearing over the system, it became Tropical Storm Virgil later that day, rapidly intensifying to a hurricane on the October 2, when a distinct and well defined eye appeared on satellite images. Virgil was originally on a slow northwest track, but a mid- upper level trough turned the hurricane to the north early on October 3. Despite the change in track, the hurricane reached a peak at minimal Category 4 status around the same time that it turned to the north that day. Virgil continued north until early on October 4, when it turned to the northwest and made landfall at high Category 2 strength, halfway between Manzanillo and L√°zaro C√°rdenas, and after landfall, the system was quickly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, passing to the north of Manzanillo late on the October 4. Shortly after passing over Manzanillo, it weakened below tropical storm strength, and early on October 5, the weakened Tropical Depression Virgil exited into the Pacific, but no regeneration was expected, as strong westerlies and the weakened state of the system prevented any regeneration, and it dissipated shortly thereafter. Because Virgil made landfall in a sparsely populated area, damage from storm surge was minimal. The chief effect was heavy rain and flooding, peaking at over in one location. =Hurricane Winifred= An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E a few hundred miles south of Acapulco. The next day, it was upgraded into Tropical Storm Winifred when satellite imagery showed increased convective banding features around the storm's center. Winifred was upgraded to a hurricane on October 8, subsequently an eye appeared on satellite imagery. Hurricane Winifred peaked at Category 3 status the next day, turning to the north-northeast just hours before landfall. Initially, the storm maintained major hurricane intensity; however, the eye had disappeared hours prior to landfall. Based on this, Winifred weakened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 9, it made landfall just east-southeast of Manzanillo. At the time it was a weak Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a central pressure of . After moving ashore, Hurricane Winifred rapidly weakened to a depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico by October 10, while continuing on a northeast track and finally degenerating to a remnant low later that day. Three people were killed by floods. Damage was concentrated in Colima and Michoac√°n. High waves flooded portions of Highway 200 between Zihuatenajo, Ixtapa, and L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Electricity and water systems was knocked out in Colima. About of farmland were damaged. Total damage in one state was estimated at 16000 pesos (1992 MXP) or $5 million (1992 USD, $ USD). The highest point maximum reported was of , recorded at L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n. Elsewhere, Winifred forced a temporary closure of the port of Acapulco. =Tropical Storm Xavier= On October 13, a tropical wave developed a visible low level circulation center, developing into Tropical Depression Twenty Five-E later that day, several hundred miles south of Baja California. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, while moving west at about . On October 17, Xavier dissipated several hundred miles south of the tip of Baja California, the remnants were tracked for several days, until it moved out of range of available satellites. Xavier was only the second tropical system to be named with an 'X' in the eastern Pacific basin, after 1985's Xina. Xavier formed at sea, and therefore, no deaths or damages are associated with it. =Tropical Storm Yolanda= On October 15 a tropical depression formed from the wave several hundred miles south of Manzanillo, and on October 16, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Yolanda. The storm turned to the northwest later that day, and maintained this track for the rest of its lifespan. Yolanda peaked as a strong tropical storm on October 19, but strong southwesterly shear removed all deep convection within the storm's circulation later that day, although there were several occasional flare-ups of convection for the next 12 hours or so. The storm weakened back to a depression the next day, while steering currents moved the weakening depression's center to the southwest, and then finally the west before dissipating in the Central Pacific on the October 22. Due to the fact that it formed at sea, no deaths or damages are associated with the storm. =Tropical Storm Zeke= On October 25, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Seven-E several hundred miles south of Baja California. It became Tropical Storm Zeke the next day, concurrent to developing banding features as well as good upper level outflow. A mid-upper level trough approached the west coast of the United States, which induced strong shear over the storm, separating deep convection from the center, and it was downgraded to depression status on October 27. However, the trough also forced Zeke north, then northeast, which resulted in the shear weakening, allowing it to re-develop, and the system was again upgraded to tropical storm status. Zeke reached peak intensity on the October 29, while on course for a potential landfall in Baja California. Despite reaching peak intensity, new westerlies spread over Zeke, which rapidly weakened the system, eventually dissipating on October 30. =Other systems= Tropical Depression Two-E developed during June 16, about to the southwest of Mexico City. Over the next few days the system moved north-westwards, but did not develop any further and dissipated on June 18. During September 24, a tropical disturbance developed within the trade-wind trough of low pressure, just to the east of the International Dateline. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it moved north-westwards, before it was classified as Tropical Depression 21W by the JTWC during September 26. The system subsequently moved out of the Central Pacific basin and into the Western Pacific, where it was immediately classified as a tropical storm by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency and named Ward by the former. During October 23, a tropical disturbance developed within the trade- wind trough of low pressure about to the south of Johnston Island. Over the next day atmospheric convection surrounding the systems low level circulation increased, as it moved towards the International Dateline. During October 24, it was classified as Tropical Depression 27W, by the JTWC in coordination with the CPHC because of its proximity to the Western Pacific basin. 27W subsequently gradually intensified further, before it was classified as a tropical storm and named Dan by the JTWC, just after it had moved into the Western Pacific basin. During November a small tropical disturbance developed, within a cloud mass over to the southwest of Hawaii's Big Island. Over the next few days, the system moved westwards and developed a closed circulation, before it was designated as Tropical Depression 03C by the CPHC during November 21. The system continued to move westwards over the next 24 hours but did not develop any further and dissipated during November 23. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeast Pacific Ocean in 1992. No eastern Pacific names were retired, so it was used again in the 1998 season. This is the same list used for the 1986 season. Storms were named Seymour, Tina, Virgil, Winifred, Xavier, Yolanda, and Zeke for the first time in 1992. Yolanda and Zeke were the first Y and Z names used in the Pacific basin. All names on the list were used this year. This is the second time that a Northeastern Pacific hurricane season had exhausted its list. The 1983 season also used every name on its list, but the list only went to the W name at the time. In addition, the 1985 season's list was lengthened while it was going on to prevent exhaustion. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Agatha * Blas * Celia * Darby * Estelle * Frank * Georgette * Howard  * Isis * Javier * Kay * Lester * Madeline * Newton * Orlene * Paine  * Roslyn * Seymour * Tina * Virgil * Winifred * Xavier * Yolanda * Zeke } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1992 are shown below. Three of them - Ekeka, Hali, and Iniki, were used throughout the course of the year. Also, a fourth system, Tropical Storm Ward, unofficially formed in the Central Pacific but received a name from the Western Pacific naming lists. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Ekeka  * Hali  * Iniki  * } =Retirement= One name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1992 season ‚Äì Iniki. It was replaced with Iolana. Later, in 2006, a name change for various Central Pacific names took place and a second name, Hali, was removed and replaced by Hene. Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1992 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals.

Typically, exempt property includes a family car, and a certain amount of cash (perhaps $10,000-$20,000), or the equivalent value in personal property. Exempt property calculations and provisions are determined on a state-by-state basis. This is important within the bankruptcy process, and may affect an individual's decision to file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. State exemptions vary from strict to generous. For example, Texas property exemptions are more lenient and include your homestead and up to $60,000 in personal property. Texas also exempts certain investments and insurance policies. Other states, such as Arizona, may exempt only $150 in a checking account comparatively speaking.

This has been attested in January 2013 by the ranking of the Global Go To Think Tanks Report (of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)): For the fifth consecutive time, DIE has been selected as one of the Top Ten influential think tanks and research institutions in the field of development policy worldwide. The German Development Institute / Deutsches Institut f√ºr Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) is one of only three European research institutes ranked in this Top Ten list. DIE improved its visibility in the international context in the current ranking on a wide scale, such as in the categories Top Think Tanks in Western Europe, Top Think Tanks ‚Äì Worldwide and Best Government Affiliated Think Tanks. Once again, DIE belongs to the Top 20 institutions among the Think Tanks with the Most Innovative Policy Ideas/Proposals. Furthermore, DIE was evaluated in a number of categories for the first time, e.g., within the category Think Tanks with Outstanding Policy-Oriented Research Programs) or in the field of knowledge marketing (Think Tanks with the Best External Relations/Public Engagement Program). The Institute is based in the UN-City of Bonn. DIE builds bridges between theory and practice and works within international research networks. The key to DIE‚Äôs success is its institutional independence, which is guaranteed by the Institute‚Äôs founding statute. The German DIE is a non-profit company with limited liability. The Institute‚Äôs institutional independence is guaranteed by its founding statute. The shareholders are the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Institute is headed by Prof. Dr. Dirk Messner (Director). At present, DIE has a staff of more than 100, two-thirds of whom are researchers. Since its founding in 1964, the German Development Institute / Deutsches Institut f√ºr Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) has based its work on the interplay between Research, Consulting and Training. These three areas complement each other and are the factors responsible for the Institute‚Äôs distinctive profile.  Research and consulting  DIE draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide, dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy. DIE‚Äôs research is theory- based, empirically backed, and application-oriented. It serves as the basis for the Institute‚Äôs consulting activities, which in turn provide the initiative for further research programmes. DIE‚Äôs Postgraduate Training Programme is an integral component of the Research and Consulting process. The many years of experience of the Institute‚Äôs professional staff as well as the creative impulses generated by the future development experts and managers trained at the Institute serve to reinforce one another. The policy advice and consulting services DIE provides are bearing on the framework conditions of development policy, including issues concerned with world economic policy, foreign policy, and security policy.  Training  The Institute‚Äôs Postgraduate Training Programme is concentrated on courses dedicated to development-related themes and issues bound up with shaping the process of globalisation as well as with improving trainee communicative and social skills. The cornerstone of the Postgraduate Training Programme ‚Äì field research carried out by small interdisciplinary groups in a developing country ‚Äì serves to provide trainees with an opportunity to gain practical experience with what they have learned by participating in concrete consulting-oriented research projects. Once they have completed the Postgraduate Training Programme, the graduates find career opportunities with development organisations in Germany and abroad. In addition to the Postgraduate Training Programme, the German Development Institute / Deutsches Institut f√ºr Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) offers Young Professionals from selected partner countries of Germany‚Äôs international cooperation the participation in the ‚ÄúGlobal Governance School‚Äù.

Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood, California, is an independent production lot providing stages and related services to television, movie and commercial production companies. Founded in 1919, the lot is one of the oldest production facilities in Hollywood and has played host to many notable productions, including such television shows as The Burns and Allen Show, I Love Lucy, The Addams Family, seasons 2-10 of Jeopardy! (1985-1994), The Rockford Files, The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show, MADtv, and The Suite Life on Deck, RuPaul's Drag Race and Raven's Home, as well as such movie productions as When Harry Met Sally... and The Player. It was previously known as Hollywood Center Studios. Sunset Las Palmas Studios continues to provide stage facilities for many television productions, including shows produced by Disney, NBC, Comedy Central and MTV. The lot features 12 sound stages, ranging in size from 4,400 square feet to 19,000 square feet, several of which are able to accommodate live audiences, as well as a virtual set stage for webcasts.  History  In 1919, John Jasper, a former associate of Charlie Chaplin, built exterior sets, three production stages and several bungalows on a 16.5 acre site in Hollywood and named it Hollywood Studios Inc. The first stages resembled hot houses with steel frames, cloth walls, glass roofs and clerestory windows. Outdoor sets included an \\"Americana\\" residential street, a massive New York street, and an elegant Spanish villa. Among the first tenants was comedian Harold Lloyd who produced some of his most successful films on the lot.Vincent, Roger (February 19, 2014) \\"L.A. developer bets on Hollywood revival with new office complex\\" Los Angeles Times The lot changed ownership and name several times during its early years while continuing to evolve and grow. In 1926, the then Metropolitan Studios began construction of one of the industry's first sound stages. A few years later, Howard Hughes took up residence on the lot and used it to shoot his World War I epic Hell's Angels (1930), known for its innovative use of sound and for the screen debut of Jean Harlow. Scores of films were produced on the lot during the 1930s and 1940s. They included the Mae West vehicles Klondike Annie and Go West, Young Man (both 1936), the 21-picture Hopalong Cassidy series, the Bing Crosby classic Pennies from Heaven (1936) and the Marx Brothers‚Äô A Night in Casablanca (1946). Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, Glenn Ford, Fredric March and Erich von Stroheim were among the stars who worked on the lot in the pre-World War II years. James Cagney made several films on the lot at a time when his brother William was a part owner. With the advent of television, production on the lot changed dramatically. In 1951, the lot made history when Stage 2 became home to I Love Lucy, the first prime-time comedy shot on film and produced before a live audience originating from the West Coast. From 1951 to 1953, it was the home of Desilu Productions, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz. The television version of actress Eve Arden's radio series Our Miss Brooks produced its first season on the stage adjacent to I Love Lucy. Both stages were known as the Desilu Playhouse seeing that a common entrance had been created at the rear of each sound stage. After the second season of I Love Lucy, Desilu moved to what is currently Red Studios Hollywood. Our Miss Brooks and other Desilu produced and filmed series moved with them. The floodgates soon opened and the lot became ground zero for television‚Äôs Golden Age. In the 1950s, General Service was the home of George Burns's McCadden Corporation (The Burns and Allen Show, The Bob Cummings Show, Panic, and The People's Choice); Ozzie Nelson's Stage Five Productions (The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet) and Jack Chertok Productions (Private Secretary). It later hosted a number of classic CBS comedies including Petticoat Junction, Green Acres and The Beverly Hillbillies. The Lone Ranger, Perry Mason, Mr. Ed, The Addams Family and Get Smart were also produced on the lot. George Burns maintained his office on the lot until his death. In 1980, director Francis Ford Coppola purchased the lot, intending to use it to produce a slate of films. Among them was the ambitious movie musical One from the Heart. For that film, Coppola transformed the entire lot into a giant set that included a replica of part of Las Vegas‚Äô McCarran Airport. During this time Mel Brooks's Brooksfilms also rented a stage on the lot to film Frances, starring Jessica Lange. Cost overruns on One From the Heart combined with its poor box-office performance caused Coppola to fall into financial difficulties and the lot was sold again, this time to Canadian real estate developers, the Singer Family. The Singers initiated a comprehensive modernization and refurbishing effort that sparked a revival of the lot‚Äôs fortunes and attracted a new generation of feature film and commercial filmmakers. The Singers also returned television production to the lot by adding control rooms and the infrastructure required for multi-camera video production. The lot again became home to some of the country‚Äôs most popular shows, including Jeopardy! (seasons 2-10), Star Search, Soul Train, The Man Show, and Pee-wee's Playhouse. In a multimillion-dollar investment, the lot‚Äôs control rooms, camera packages and infrastructure were upgraded to HDTV. This was done to support television clients such as Disney Channel, which produced a number of original series under their It's a Laugh Productions banner for Disney Channel and Disney XD lot. Three cyc stages were added, one dedicated to green screen production. A virtual set stage was also built to provide a cost-effective way to produce high-quality content for broadcast and the web. Additionally, production office space more than doubled, providing homes for independent companies. In May, 2017, a Los Angeles based real estate company, Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., purchased Hollywood Center Studios from the Singer family for $200 million, then immediately renamed the property as the \\"Sunset Las Palmas Studios.\\" References External links *Official website Category:1919 establishments in California Category:American film studios Category:Buildings and structures in Hollywood Category:Cinema of Southern California Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Hollywood history and culture Category:Television studios in the United States ","title":"Sunset Las Palmas Studios"},{"id":"2187742","text":"Harvest Home may refer to: * Harvest Home (Hilda Vaughan novel), a 1936 novel by Hilda Vaughan * Harvest Home (novel), a 1973 horror novel by Tom Tryon ** An abbreviated name for the 1978 television mini-series adapted from the novel, more properly :The Dark Secret of Harvest Home * Harvest Home (1995 film), a 1995 film * Harvest Home (2009 film), a 2009 film by Craig Whitney * \\"Harvest Home\\" (song), a 1982 song by Big Country * Mabon (Wicca) or Harvest Home, a holiday in the Wiccan Wheel of the Year * Harvest Home, a shipwreck off the coast of Newfoundland * Crop Over, a harvest festival originating in Barbados * Harvest Home, Irish folk tune See also * \\"Come Ye Thankful People, Come\\", a hymn ","title":"Harvest Home"},{"id":"2187753","text":"The 1990 Pacific hurricane season was a very active season which observed 21 named storms within the basin. The season also produced the fourth highest ACE index value on record. The season was officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, these bounds were slightly exceeded when Hurricane Alma formed on May 12. Hurricane Alma became the third earliest tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific basin since the satellite era began in 1966, while Trudy is the third strongest October eastern Pacific hurricane on record. Overall, the impact of this season was minimal. Tropical Storm Rachel made two landfalls in Mexico and brought rain to the United States. Hurricane Boris brought light showers to California.

All of the tropical cyclones of this year developed from westward-moving African tropical waves. The season established several tropical storm records for this basin and was marked by several strong hurricanes. There were 21 named tropical cyclones, seven below the record established by the 1992 Pacific hurricane season two years later, but four more than the long-term average. Sixteen of those named storms, twice the average and four more than the previous record, reached hurricane intensity. Only Cristina, Douglas, Aka, Rachel, and Simon did not reach hurricane strength. Six of those hurricanes reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricanes Hernan and Trudy were among the strongest ever observed in this area. Alma became the earliest named tropical cyclone for the eastern Pacific ocean east of the 140th meridian west. The eastern Pacific produced four tropical depressions that did not reach tropical storm status. With the exception of Marie and Polo, these systems developed between 5¬∞ and 15¬∞N, east of the longitude of Baja California in the climatologically favored area for tropical cyclogenesis. After their development, most of the tropical cyclones moved on a west to northwest track and dissipated over cool waters without affecting land. Rachel was the only system to make landfall. In addition, one tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific and eventually crossed the International Dateline before dissipating. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. The cumulative ACE for the Eastern Pacific this season fell within the official \\"Above Normal\\" grading, being one of the most active. This occurred because the season had many intense storms that lasted for a long period of time. Also it is important to note that this is the fourth highest ACE, only behind the 1992, 2015 and 2018 seasons respectively. Systems =Hurricane Alma= A tropical wave emerged from Africa on April 29. It then moved across the Atlantic, crossed northern South America, and entered the Pacific Ocean on May 9. Convection started to increase with the wave just to the south of Panama. The wave moved westward and continued to become better organized over the next few days. On May 12, the wave had become organized enough and was designated Tropical Depression One-E. Tropical Depression One-E moved slowly to the northwest while strengthening slowly due to easterly vertical wind shear. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma on May 14. The storm quickly strengthened once the vertical wind shear relaxed and was near hurricane force by the morning of May 15. Hurricane Alma reached its peak intensity early on May 16 with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). The hurricane entered an area of southwesterly wind shear caused by an upper-level ridge of high pressure. The increasing vertical wind shear and cooler water caused Alma to weaken to a tropical storm. On May 17, the storm continued to weaken and became a depression. The next day, the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone well west of mainland Mexico. Alma was the earliest named storm and hurricane in the satellite era in the east Pacific proper at the time; the storm was subsequently eclipsed by Adrian in 2017. =Hurricane Boris= A tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on May 20. The wave did not significantly develop as it moved west across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Once it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, cloudiness increased considerably with the system on May 31. It became well- enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Two-E on June 2. After becoming a depression, the system moved to the west-northwestward. Upper-level easterly vertical wind shear limited the amount of the initial strengthening. However, an increase in convective banding led to its upgrade to Tropical Storm Boris on June 4, southwest of Manzanillo. Further strengthening occurred due to an anticyclone aloft fostered additional development, and by June 5, Boris became a hurricane. The hurricane began to move to the north-northwest in response to a trough off of the West Coast of the United States. Strengthening continued, and the storm reached its peak strength with winds of and a minimum central pressure of . The hurricane's cloud pattern became elongated along a southwest-northeast axis on June 6 due to an increased amount of vertical wind shear. Boris was downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day on June 6. The deep convection of the tropical storm decreased, as Boris moved over cooler waters. It was downgraded to a tropical depression on June 7 due to these factors. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 8 as the system quickly lost its tropical characteristics. A small circulation remained in the cloud field offshore the northwest coast of Baja California for a few more days. The winds in the eyewall of Boris ripped off the sails of the Azure Dream sailboat. Outer rainbands from the storm produced moderate rain in several Mexican states. In Mexico, rainfall peaked at near San Lucas, Michoac√°n. The remnants of Boris also brought sporadic rainfall over the western United States, with precipitation being reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and Wyoming. The remnants of Boris were responsible for causing the wettest June in San Diego since records began in 1850; however, not even of rain fell at that location. Rainfall from the remnant system in the United States peaked at over the Santa Rita Mountains. No other direct damages or casualties were reported from Boris. =Tropical Storm Cristina= A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa on May 28. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, where convection organized with the system on June 6. The system became well-enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Three-E on June 8, while south of the southern tip of Baja California. The depression continued to strengthen, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Cristina on June 9. Cristina initially had well-established upper-level outflow. It failed to reach hurricane status, peaking with maximum sustained winds of due to movement of its associated upper-level anticyclone to the north over Mexico which caused Cristina to be exposed to easterly vertical wind shear. Cristina moved generally northwestward, which eventually placed the storm in cooler waters, and caused the deep convection of the system to dissipate. On June 14, Cristina diminished to a tropical depression. Cristina moved west-northwestward with the low-level flow. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 16, after a lack of deep convection for 48 hours. =Tropical Storm Douglas= A tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on June 5. It continued westward across the tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean on June 16, where it generated an area of increased cloudiness. Organization of thunderstorm activity increased late on June 18 and early on June 19. Tropical Depression Four-E formed on June 19, when it was south of Acapulco, Mexico after evidence of low-level circulation for the past 24 hours. The depression moved in a west-northwest direction, due to a subtropical ridge north of the depression. Satellite analysis indicated that the depression had reached tropical storm force strength, and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Douglas on June 19, while southwest of Acapulco. Douglas reached peak strength of on June 21 A tropical storm warning was issued on June 21, from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes before being discontinued on June 22. Tropical Storm Douglas brushed the western coast of Mexico. The center of circulation approached within of the coast of Mexico on June 22. Douglas then began to weaken because of interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. The system continued to weaken despite warm water temperatures and favorable upper-level conditions. Douglas dissipated early on June 24, while south-southeast off the southern tip of Baja California. The highest rainfall report from Mexico from Douglas totaled at La Huerta. No deaths or damage were reported. =Hurricane Elida= A tropical wave came off the coast of Africa into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June 10 and 11. The system moved across the Atlantic and entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The wave became a significant tropical system, with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system's cloudiness on June 25. The center of circulation was located south of Acapulco, Mexico. The system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered Tropical Depression Five-E on June 26. The depression quickly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Elida later that day. The track of Elida was west-northwestward to northwestward from June 27 through June 28. Some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern Mexico, but no flooding, damage, or casualties were reported as a result. Elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on June 28 passing directly over Socorro Island later in the day, right as Elida reached peak strength of , dropping of rain on the island. Some windows broke also as a result, and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island. A high-pressure area to the north forced Elida to move more westward on June 29. Convection began to decrease in the hurricane as it moved into cooler waters, and it weakened to a tropical storm later in the day. It then weakened to a tropical depression on July 1, and dissipated on July 2. =Tropical Depression Six-E= An area of disturbed weather south of Acapulco organized into Tropical Depression Six-E on June 29 and the system began to move northwest. Originally the system was expected to reach tropical storm strength and near hurricane intensity by late on July 2 or early on July 3, however persistent vertical wind shear over the system impeded its development. After convection began to merge into the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Tropical Depression Six-E, stating that the depression dissipated, and regeneration seemed unlikely. However, wind shear began to decrease, and convection associated with the remnants of Tropical Depression Six-E quickly began to increase. Although the low-level circulation was near the edge of the deep convection, the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on Tropical Depression Six-E by July 1. Intensification into a tropical storm was again predicted, but Tropical Depression Six-E remained poorly defined, and eventually dissipated on July 4. =Hurricane Fausto= A tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on June 19. The wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, into the warm waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, on July 2. An area of disturbed weather moved northwards towards the Gulf of Tehuantepec and became Tropical Depression Seven-E early on July 6. The depression moved northwest, and because of increased organization of deep convection, was designated Tropical Storm Fausto on July 7, south of Manzanillo, Mexico. A weakly defined eye formed on July 8, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Fausto, south of Cabo San Lucas. Fausto peaked in strength with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of on July 9. Fausto passed 40 mi (60 km) north of Socorro Island causing a northwest wind of 40 mph (60 km/h), and of rain at that location. The hurricane fluctuated in intensity on July 10, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day, west of Cabo San Lucas. The weakening Fausto moved over continuing cooler waters, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 11, west of Cabo San Lucas. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on July 13, and its low level circulation of clouds persisted for a few days. =Hurricane Genevieve= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 25 and moved across the Atlantic Ocean and central Caribbean Sea with little development. Within the western Caribbean Sea, convection developed with the wave on July 7. The system became better organized as it moved into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 11. The depression moved west-northwest, with a good outflow to the north, and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Genevieve later that day. Genevieve continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on July 13. The storm approached within of Socorro Island where a sustained wind of and gust of were reported, before the weather equipment on the island failed. The hurricane began to turn west because of the strengthening and growing ridge to its north. Increasing outflow aloft began to form, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 105 mph (170 km/h) with a well-defined eye at its center of circulation. Genevieve turned northwest on July 16 into an area with strong vertical wind shear and low water temperatures. The hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm on July 17 and then into a tropical depression on July 18. Genevieve dissipated as a tropical cyclone later in the day, reduced to a circulation in the stratocumulus cloud field. =Hurricane Hernan= A tropical wave that moved off the northwest coast of Africa on July 4 passed through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Pacific Ocean on July 15. Thunderstorm activity increased in the system between July 16 and 18 before rainbands became present within the tropical disturbance on July 19. Tropical Depression Nine-E formed later that day while 565 mi (910 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Tropical Depression Nine-E strengthened into Tropical Storm Hernan on July 21 while 684 mi (1,100 km) south of Cabo San Lucas. The tropical storm continued to strengthen and as it moved to the northwest, and became a hurricane late on July 21. Hernan continued to strengthen and as it passed 145 mi (230 km) southwest of Clarion Island. On July 23, Hernan reached its peak strength of 155 mph (250 km/h) and minimum pressure of as the center of circulation was 207 mi (335 km) south-southwest of Clarion Island. On July 24, concentric eyewalls (one eyewall located inside another) formed around the center of Hernan, which was the first time this pattern had been observed with an eastern Pacific hurricane. Hernan kept Category 4 hurricane intensity a few more days and hurricane strength for six days overall. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on July 28 as it moved over cooler waters. Hernan turned more to the west as its low level center became separated from its thunderstorm activity and was steering by a surface high-pressure system to its north. Hernan moved over cooler waters, dissipating as a tropical cyclone early on July 31. =Hurricane Iselle= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 7\\\\. The wave moved west, but it was not until it moved across the Caribbean Sea that the wave's convection organized. The system entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean with concentrated convection and a surface center of circulation while southeast of Acapulco. Moving west- northwest, Tropical Depression Ten-E formed on July 20 south of Puerto √Ångel, Mexico. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iselle. The storm continued strengthening while in the proximity of Hurricane Hernan, becoming a hurricane on July 22. The hurricane continued to move west-northwest through its duration, and reached its peak strength of on July 25\\\\. Iselle crossed Socorro Island, which recorded a sustained wind and heavy rain on July 25. The hurricane weakened on following days after it moved over cooler waters, downgraded to a tropical storm on July 28 and subsequently into a tropical depression on July 30\\\\. The depression dissipated later that day, after losing its low-level circulation southwest of San Diego. =Tropical Depression Eleven-E= On July 24 a tropical disturbance behind Hurricane Hernan strengthened into a tropical depression. Due to the close proximity of Hernan to its west, the development of the depression was hindered due to vertical wind shear from the outflow of Hernan. This wind shear dissipated the depression on July 26, and its remnants were absorbed by the nearby cyclone. No damages or casualties were caused by the depression as it was well out to sea. =Tropical Storm Aka= Tropical Storm Aka was the only tropical storm to form in the Central North Pacific during 1990. An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August 6. By August 7, the system became well-enough organized to become designated Tropical depression One-C. The depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving west, to the south of the Hawaiian Islands. On August 10, Tropical Storm Aka peaked with maximum sustained winds of . The storm continued to move west and approached Johnston Island, though the island's weather did not deteriorate. The tropical storm crossed the International Date Line on August 13. Aka weakened back into a depression and dissipated two days later on August 15. =Tropical Depression Diana= Hurricane Diana struck eastern Mexico and managed to hold together, remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean late on August 8. Although Tropical Depression Diana entered the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center did not re-classify the system. No re- intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern Pacific, and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day. The remnant tropical disturbance recurved through the Gulf of California while developing significant convection before it moved into northwest Mexico, which brought rainfall amounts of over to local areas within the state of Sonora. The remnant disturbance moved into the American Southwest on August 11. =Tropical Depression Two-C= Tropical Depression Two-C was the second and last tropical cyclone to develop within the north-central Pacific Ocean in 1990. The depression developed from a tropical disturbance well southeast of Hawaii, which became much better organized on the night of August 10. The tropical depression moved in a west northwest direction for the next 18 hours and then changed to a west-southwest track on August 11. As it turned more to the southwest, the depression weakened until it dissipated on August 13 about south-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. =Tropical Depression Twelve-E= A persistent area of thunderstorm activity southwest of Puerto Vallarta became better organized and strengthened into Tropical Depression Twelve-E on August 16. Moving northwest, the system developed slowly as it was embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Easterly shear kept the system from reaching tropical storm strength and caused its ultimate dissipation on August 19. No damages or fatalities were caused by this depression. =Hurricane Julio= A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The system entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and became well-enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on August 17 while centered south of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved on a west-northwestward track and strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Julio on August 18. Strengthening continued and Julio reached hurricane strength on August 19. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of on August 21. The storm turned westward and began weakening. Julio regained tropical storm status on August 23 and tropical depression status on August 24 before dissipating as a tropical cyclone later that day. No damage was reported from Julio. =Hurricane Kenna= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9, and spawned Tropical Storm Fran four days later, before it moved through the southern Windward Islands on August 14. While Fran dissipated shortly after that, the tropical wave progressed into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The wave spawned Tropical Depression Fourteen-E east-southeast of Hurricane Julio. The depression moved westward for the next several days. As Julio weakened, the depression began to increase in strength. It became Tropical Storm Kenna on August 22 and continued to strengthen into a hurricane on August 25, peaking with winds of the next day. On August 26, a strong frontal trough weakened the high pressure system to the storm's north, causing a turn to the north during the next few days. The hurricane weakened in response to cooler water and increasing vertical wind shear, which removed convection from its center. Kenna weakened back to tropical storm strength on August 28, then into a tropical depression on August 29. The system dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 30. =Hurricane Lowell= A tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August 11. After moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without development, the system moved through the Intertropical Convergence Zone of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The cloudiness moved northward toward the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August 22. The thunderstorm activity organized sufficiently for the system to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 23 while southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm 217 mi (350 km) south-southwest of Puerto Vallarta on August 25. The storm began to turn more westward due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and was upgraded to a hurricane on August 27 while southwest of Cabo San Lucas. As the high to the north continued to strengthen, the hurricane turned west-southwest. Thunderstorm activity with the hurricane began to weaken and Lowell was downgraded back to tropical storm status on August 28. The tropical storm then turned to a north-northwestward with the storm passing over cooler waters. On August 31, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, with only minimal amounts of deep convection remaining within its circulation. Lowell dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 1, though a low-level circulation of clouds could be seen on satellite imagery for the next few days. No damage or casualties was reported as a result of Lowell. =Hurricane Marie= A tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa on August 16. The wave moved west through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America and into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, on August 29. Isolated convection with the system increased while south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec as the system moved northwest parallel to the southwest coast of Mexico. Once convective activity increased, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Sixteen-E on September 7 while centered 659 mi (1,060 km) southwest of Clarion Island. A weaker than normal high pressure system controlled the movement of the depression, and the system moved slowly to the west through its duration. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Marie on September 8, and into a hurricane on September 9, while south-southwest of Clarion Island. Marie reached its peak intensity of on September 11. The hurricane crossed into the central North Pacific on September 14 as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . The hurricane weakened thereafter and on September 17 Marie regained tropical storm status. The system weakened into a tropical depression on September 19 and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 21 near the Hawaiian coast. No casualties or damages were caused by Marie. =Hurricane Norbert= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean and began to show signs of organized thunderstorm development. Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed on September 10 while centered south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression became better organized and strengthened into Tropical Storm Norbert later in the day. On September 12, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen-E which was in close proximity. Norbert strengthened as it moved north-northwestward. The tropical storm was upgraded to a hurricane on September 14, and formed an eye on September 15. The storm reached its peak strength of sustained winds that day. Turning north of due west, Norbert then weakened as it moved over cooler waters. It was downgraded to a tropical storm later on September 15, and then to a tropical depression on September 18. Norbert dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 19 after losing all its deep convection. =Tropical Depression Eighteen-E= On September 12, satellite images indicated that the eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Located in close proximity to Tropical Storm Norbert, the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures, and the National Hurricane Center noted that only very little intensification was possible. As predicted, Norbert hindered further intensification of Tropical Depression Eighteen-E. The National Hurricane Center noted six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into Norbert. The National Hurricane Center later believed that Tropical Depression Eighteen-E was \\"dominating\\" the interaction between the two systems, and was forecast to absorb Norbert. Unlike the latter prediction, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen-E later that day. =Hurricane Odile= A tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September 5, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of convection entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean a few hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. On September 23, Tropical Depression Nineteen-E formed from this convection, while south-southeast from the southern tip of Baja California. The depression moved on a west-northwestward track, rounding the southwest side of a strong high pressure system. The depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Odile on September 24 and into a hurricane on September 25. Its intensity peaked with maximum sustained winds of on September 26. The hurricane began to turn more northwestward in response to a high-pressure system weakening to its north. Odile began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters on September 28. The cyclone regained tropical storm status on September 29 while it slowly progressed northward. The system weakened into a tropical depression status on September 30. Once it lost its deep convection, Odile was steered southwestward by the low-level flow, before it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on October 2. Its remaining low-level circulation of clouds continued on a southwestward course thereafter. =Tropical Storm Rachel= In mid-September, a weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Northwest Africa. It moved westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean early on September 23. Cloudiness became concentrated with the system south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. On September 27, the organized thunderstorm area was upgraded to Tropical Depression Twenty One-E while south of Acapulco. The depression developed slowly, and became a tropical storm on September 30. As Rachel briefly moved northward, before re-curving and accelerating towards the Mexican coast. The storm passed over the southern portion of Baja California Sur on October 2. Rachel made its final landfall midway between Los Mochis and Culiac√°n, and became the only system to make landfall from the eastern north Pacific Ocean in 1990. Rachel decayed rapidly over land, and the final public advisory on Rachel was issued early on October 3. its remnants continued accelerating over Texas until they lost their identity. The highest rainfall total from the system in Mexico totaled at Santa Anita near the tip of Baja California. Across northern Mexico, thousands were homeless, and 18 people died. In Texas, Rachel's remnants caused heavy rain. Flooding occurred in the Big Bend area. =Hurricane Polo= Polo originated from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September 2 which spawned Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin. On September 14, the system increased in convection as it was moving to the west and approaching Central America. The southern extent of the wave crossed into the Pacific Ocean on September 18. The wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week. The convective system organized into Tropical Depression Twenty-E on September 28 nearly midway between Mexico and Hawaii. Initially, the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper-level trough located to its west. Polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on September 30, with its winds peaking at . Since the storm was very small, vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter. On October 1, Polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north Central Pacific basin. It dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day. There were no casualties or damages caused by Polo. =Tropical Storm Simon= A weakly defined tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on September 20, and crossed the northern portion of the tropical Atlantic and northern South America without significant organization. The wave moved into the northeastern Pacific waters, off the coast of Colombia on September 30. As the wave passed over southern Central America, rainbands and cloudiness increased with the system between October 1 and October 3, before the system merged with the ITCZ from October 4 to October 6. Signs of convective organization reappeared on October 8, and by October 9, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Twenty Two-E south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression continued to develop and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Simon on October 10 while south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Due to a high-pressure system to the north-northwest, Simon continued on a west-northwestward path. The tropical storm continued to strengthen to its peak intensity of by late on October 11. Simon passed over cooler waters and weakened back into a tropical depression on October 13. The depression moved on a westward course, and the low-level circulation was displaced from its deep convection during the following day. Simon then dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on October 15 across the open waters of the northeast Pacific. =Hurricane Trudy= The tropical wave that would become future Hurricane Trudy became identifiable on satellite imagery as early as September 30, emerging near the African coast off Cape Verde. However, the wave did not show any signs of development until October 16, when the wave developed into a tropical depression several hundred kilometers south of Acapulco. The tropical depression intensified significantly. The ship Maple Ace reported tropical storm-force winds about from the center at 1800 UTC on October 18. In less than 36 hours, at 1200 UTC on October 20, Trudy became a powerful hurricane with Category Four equivalent maximum winds of and a minimum pressure of according to satellite estimates. The hurricane was at least as intense as Hurricane Max three years earlier and Hurricane Hernan earlier in the year. Estimates state that Trudy may have been the strongest eastern Pacific hurricane since wind estimates have been available from satellite images. An upper-level trough forced Trudy to move northwards, increasing the risk of hurricane conditions to Baja California residents. The same trough caused an unfavorable environment that caused Trudy to weaken considerably. At that time, dynamically based numeral models forecasted Trudy to move northwards over Baja California and make landfall there. Authorities closed five ports on Baja California and the Pacific Ocean port of Mazatl√°n on October 22 as Hurricane Trudy was approaching the Mexican coast with gusts of up to . However, the trough progressed eastwards and was replaced by a ridge, sparing a landfall, but still causing locally heavy rainfall and high waves. Socorro Island reported hurricane-force winds for more than 7 hours. Moving away from land, Trudy then started to re-intensify, developing an unusually large eye of nearly in diameter. However, another deep trough approached Trudy and pulled the hurricane northwards, shearing it at the same time. Trudy dissipated on November 1 at 1800 UTC. Its remnant moisture spread over parts of Mexico and the United States. Trudy is the fourth-strongest Pacific hurricane in October, behind Kenna of the 2002 season, Rick of the 2009 season, and Patricia of the 2015 season. =Hurricane Vance= An area of disturbed weather, possibly related to a tropical wave, organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E on October 21. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Vance early on October 23 and then into a hurricane two days later. Vance moved parallel to the west coast of Mexico and approached the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Before it could strike land, a high-pressure area blocked Vance's path and forced the storm to transcribe a small clockwise loop over a two-day period. During the loop, Vance encountered wind shear and cool waters stirred up by Trudy as well as earlier in its duration. Vance weakened to a tropical storm on October 27 and a depression on October 30. The cyclone dissipated late on October 31. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1990. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. Since no names were retired, no new names were replaced for the 1996 season. This same list was used in the 1984 season. Wallis would trade years with Winnie in future seasons. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Alma * Boris * Cristina * Douglas * Elida * Fausto * Genevieve * Hernan  * Iselle * Julio * Kenna * Lowell * Marie * Norbert * Odile * Polo  * Rachel * Simon * Trudy * Vance * Wallis (unused) * Xavier (unused) * Yolanda (unused) * Zeke (unused) } = Central Pacific = For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.

He was the founder and the head of the Bektashi Sufi lodge (tekke) located in Taylor, Michigan, United States. Early life Baba Rexheb was born as Rexheb Beqiri, on 18 August 1901, into a family with strong Bektashi ties in Gjirokast√´r, southern Albania, at a time when Albania was still part of the Ottoman Empire. His father, Refat Beqiri, was a local mullah in the old neighbourhood of Dunavat, Gjirokast√´r. Refat‚Äôs family had originally migrated to southern Albania from the Kosovar town of Gjakova. His mother was from Elbasan in central Albania as was his murshid, his spiritual guide, Selim Baba Elbasani. He entered the Bektashi Order at the age of sixteen and was promoted to the rank of dervish at the age of twenty. A year later, he took an additional vow as a m√ºcerred (celibate) dervish. For the next twenty-five years he served in the Asim Baba Tekke, under the guidance of his maternal uncle, Baba Selim. During World War II, Dervish Rexhep followed the guidance of his murshid and went from village to village, telling the people that the communists \\"Din yok, vatan yok,\\" that is, \\"They have no religion, they have no homeland.\\" Because of this he was forced to flee in 1944 when the communists under Enver Hoxha came to power. He spent four years in a displaced persons camps in Italy. His dream was to serve Bektashis in America, but after World War II, it was very difficult to come to America. So instead he went to the Bektashi Kaygusuz Sultan Tekke in the Mokattam in Cairo, Egypt. He stayed there for four years until his number for the United States finally came up. He traveled to New York City where one of his sisters, Zejnep Cu√ßi, had preceded him.Trix, Frances. The Sufi Journey of Baba Rexheb. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology with University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009. Harabati Baba Tekke of Tetovo, Macedonia. Bektashi career In 1954, Baba Rexheb established the First Albanian American Bektashi Monastery outside Detroit, Michigan, where there was a group of Albanian Bektashis who supported him.Xhevat Kallaxhi. Bektashism & the Albanian Tekke in America. Babagan Books, 2010 (originally published in 1964). Baba Rexheb was joined by Baba Bajram, Dervish Arshi, and small number of other Bektashi clerics from Egypt and the Balkans. In the 1960s, Albanian Bektashi immigrants began to arrive the Detroit area from Macedonia and these strengthened the Bektashi community. At this time the Bektashi Teqe was also a working farm with orchards, fields, gardens, animals, and a large hen barn. Bektashis came from Canada and other parts of America to be with Baba. There were always many people at the long kitchen table for the main midday meal of the day. People gathered outside in the garden and many came days early for the holidays. In 1967 Baba Rexheb began his master work in Albanian, \\"Misticizma Islame dhe Bektashizma\\" (\\"Islamic Mysticism and Bektashism\\".) He published it in 1970. Later he was asked by Baba Qamil of Gjakova in Kosova to translate into Albanian Fuzuli's \\"Hadikat-i Su'ada,\\" a classic 16th century work in Ottoman Turkish, parts of which are read aloud at the holiday of Muharrem. Indeed, he was the only one in the world with the depth of Islamic learning and linguistic skills to do this. Baba was fluent in Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, modern Turkish, Greek, and Italian. He had passed the tests for the ulemma back in Albania, but more important, he had studied Arabic and Persian texts with Selim Baba Elbasani for twenty years. While he was in Egypt, he had also spent time in the Bektashi library reading more of these texts. Baba Rexheb taught in Turkish an American student, Frances Trix, who learned Albanian, for over twenty years. His prayers were sought by people of all backgrounds.Frances Trix, over 30 years with the Detroit Bektashi community and 25 years study with Baba Rexheb.Much of this is also in Trix, Frances. The Sufi Journey of Baba Rexheb. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology with University of Pennsylvania Press,2009. Baba Rexheb died on August 10, 1995 (Rabi' ul-Awwal 12, 1416 Hijrah). His t√ºrbe (mausoleum) is located on the tekke grounds and is open for pilgrims and truth-seekers of all walks.

Main ideas  Named after Eleftherios Venizelos, the key characteristics of Venizelism were: *Greek irredentism: The support of the Megali Idea. *Liberal democracy: Venizelists represented upcoming urban classes that reacted against the nepotism of the old conservative establishment, which also had close ties with the palace. *Pro-West: Alliance with Entente against the militarism of the Central Powers during WWI, and with the Allies during WWII. Also pro-West during the Cold War. *Republicanism: Despite Venizelos' moderation regarding the monarchy, most of his supporters were in favour of a Republic, on the French standards. *Mixed economic policies: from economic liberalism to social democracy policies.Eleftherios Venizelos: The Trials of Statesmanship, Paschalis M. Kitromilides, Eleftherios Venizelos: The Trials of Statesmanship, Edinburgh University Press 2008, p.285-306 *Anti-communism: Venizelos rejected the bolshevik system and was the main introducer of the Idionymon anticommunist law in 1929. In the contemporary sense the ideology incorporates national liberalism, civic nationalism, economic liberalism, liberal democracy, pro-Europeanism, republicanism, secularism, centrism, radical centrism and generally moves from centre-right to social democracy.  History  =Liberal Party= Eleftherios Venizelos Venizelos' liberal party ruled Greece from 1910 until 1916. That year, determined to enter World War I on the entente side, Venizelos rebelled against the king and formed a Provisional Government of National Defence in Thessaloniki. Venizelos regained full control of the country in 1917 and ruled until losing the 1920 elections. The strongest support for Venizelism came in the \\"New Greece\\" gained after the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 consisting of Crete, Thrace, Epirus, the North Aegean islands, and Macedonia.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.277-278 By contrast, people in \\"Old Greece\\" tended to be more much royalist. The fact that in 1916 King Constantine I had allowed the Bulgarians to occupy parts of Macedonia and had been willing to contemplate giving up all of recently gained \\"New Greece\\" in the north to the Bulgarians to weaken the Venizelist movement cemented the identification of people in northern Greece with Venizelism.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.278 Refugees from Turkey also tended be strongly VenizelistKostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.260., at least until the 1930s and the signing of the Greco-Turkish friendship agreement by Venizelos (1930). After a crisis period (including two short-lived pro-Venizelist military governments after Nikolaos Plastiras 1922 revolution) the liberals returned to power from 1928 until 1932. Venizelists Sophoklis Venizelos and Georgios Papandreou formed the core of the Greek government in exile during the Axis Occupation of Greece (1941‚Äì1944), and held power a number of times in the 1950s. =Centre Union= Georgios Papandreou, leader of the Centre Union. Georgios Papandreou created the Centre Union party in 1961, as a coalition of old Venizelists and progressive politicians. In 1963 the party was elected and held power until 1965, when its right wing broke ranks in the events known as the Apostasia. The current Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Centre Union. =Centrist Democratic Union= After the 1967-1974 Junta, Venizelists formed the Centre Union ‚Äì New Forces party, which then evolved into the Union of the Democratic Centre (). While the Venizelist legacy was still popular, election results were disappointing as the abolition of the monarchy, the dilution of support for Greek nationalism after the seven years of the junta and the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and Karamanlis' move towards the political centre had blurred the differences between the liberals and their former conservative opponents, while the socialist PASOK party was gaining support at the left side of the spectrum. Most members of the Centre Union ‚Äì New Forces party with their leader Georgios Mavros were absorbed by PASOK. Legacy Although the image of Venizelos is still very popular in Greece today, Venizelism is no longer a major force in Greek politics. Venizelos' prestige however and his ideology's connotations of republicanism, and progressive reforms means that most mainstream political forces claim his political heritage. There are few explicitly \\"Venizelist\\" movements today in Greece. In the 2004 elections for the European Parliament, the leading Venizelist party was the Union of Centrists, gaining only 0.54% of the Greek popular vote. An attempted revival of the original Liberal Party, under the same name, was founded in the 1980s by Venizelos' grandson, Nikitas Venizelos. Antivenizelism Against Venizelos' policies could be found politicians of different political orientation during the 1910s (monarchists, conservatives, part of the clergy, but also socialists/communists of the newly founded SEKE). Some points of disagreement included the Venizelos' extreme pro-Entente stance during the World War I and the National Schism (which led to the division of the country between a venizelist and a royalist government), his policy about the Megali idea and its results (regarding the relations with Turkey and the Greeks who were still under Ottoman sovereignty) and later the Treaty of Lausanne and the population exchange. With antivenizelism sided also the religious minorities in Greece (Muslim, Jewish etc), being in general of conservative political orientation.Isabelle D√©pret, \\"Ioannis Metaxas and Religion (1938-41): Historical Experience and Current Debates in Greece\\", Cahiers balkaniques, 42, 2014 In french Another common point of the antivenizelists was a criticism about the country's social and economical transformation/modernization, such as critics for political/economical mismanagement.

Design/history Though technically a wedge, pitching wedges are generally treated as if they were numbered irons. This is for a number of reasons: first, before the term \\"wedge\\" became common for high-loft short irons, the pitching wedge was actually numbered as the \\"10-iron\\" of a matched set, and to this day it follows the normal loft progression of the numbered irons. Also, even though it has been named a wedge, many matched iron sets for retail sale include the pitching wedge even when not including other wedges. Finally, the loft of modern irons has been reduced compared to older designs. This is both to compensate for cavity-back iron designs that launch the ball higher for a given loft, and to increase the distance carried by each club for the average golfer's clubhead speed. (Professionals now also use similar designs, preserving the gap in hitting distance between the amateur golfer and the pro.) As a result the loft of the pitching wedge decreased along with the numbered irons from a traditional loft of between 48‚Äì54¬∞ to between 45‚Äì50¬∞, similar to that of an older 8-iron. Many pitching wedges have a loft close to 50¬∞. Usage The pitching wedge is a very versatile club. Being on the cusp between numbered irons and wedges, the pitching wedge has generally accepted uses falling into either class. Used with a \\"full swing\\" similar to a short iron, a golfer can produce a high-trajectory shot that carries between (depending on a variety of factors such as swing and club design), then \\"bites\\" with little or no roll after initial impact. Used with an abbreviated \\"chipping\\" motion, the club can produce short () \\"lob\\" or \\"approach\\" shots. And with a \\"putting\\" motion, the club can lift the ball over rough or fringe onto the putting green from a short distance to the pin (). This last kind of stroke is commonly called a \\"bump and run\\" and can be done with many other irons, generally with a loft equal or higher than a 7-iron. These clubs are most commonly used with a full swing to produce high-altitude shots such as approaches to the green or lifting the ball over trees. They are also commonly used to \\"lay up\\" in front of a hazard or to create a better lie for the next shot, and for recovery from firmer rough or sometimes from sand when the ball is lying on top of the surface. The loft of a particular pitching wedge follows the progression of the numbered irons of the same set, and these sets can have subtle differences in the loft progression and starting loft of the set, so the loft of pitching wedges can vary widely between sets. The loft of a pitching wedge generally falls between 42 and 49 degrees, but the launch angle and the average carry distance of the club between sets are typically similar. Pitching wedges can also have between zero and 10 degrees of bounce, though most pitching wedges have very low bounce (only 2 or 3 degrees) as other wedges like gap wedges or sand wedges are more traditionally suited for play out of hazards or soft lies where high bounce is desired.

Inis M√≥r has a population of about 840, making it the largest of the Aran Islands in terms of population and largest island off the Irish coast with no bridge or causeway to the mainland. The island is famous for its strong Irish culture, loyalty to the Irish language, and a wealth of Pre-Christian and Christian ancient sites including D√∫n Aonghasa, described as \\"the most magnificent barbaric monument in Europe\\" by George Petrie. Name Prior to the 20th century, the island was more commonly called Inis Bant or as √Årainn na Naomh. The modern Irish name, √Årainn Mh√≥r, (which translates as \\"Great Aran\\" in English) leads to some confusion with Arranmore, County Donegal. The Irish word ' means \\"long ridge\\", presumably referring to the island's geography. √Årainn is the legal placename in Irish or English as declared in the Official Languages Act 2003.  Geology and geography  The island is an extension of the Burren. The terrain of the island is composed of limestone pavements with crisscrossing cracks known as \\"grikes\\", leaving isolated rocks called \\"clints\\". The limestones date from the Visean period (Lower Carboniferous), formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins and ammonites. Glaciation following the Namurian phase facilitated greater denudation. The result is that Inis M√≥r and the other islands are among the finest examples of Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the island overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier Karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any Karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and the island Karst is thus recent. Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of sub-terrainean drainage. =Towns and villages= *Cill R√≥n√°in (Kilronan) *Eochaill (Oghill) *Mainistir (Manister) *Cill Mhuirbhigh (Kilmurvy) *Iarairne (Eararna) *Cill √âinne (Killeany) *Gort na gCapall *Fearann an Choirce (Oatquarter) *Corr√∫ch *Creig an Ch√©ir√≠n *Bungabhla *Baile na Creige *Sruth√°n *Eoghanacht (Onaght) Flora and fauna The island supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side by side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are known for their unusual assemblage of plants and animals. The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids. Insects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges. Tourism Na Seacht dTeampaill (The Seven Churches), Inis M√≥r Inis M√≥r today is a major tourist destination, with bed and breakfast accommodation scattered across the island. Private minibuses, horse-drawn carriages and bicycles are the main methods of getting about for the numerous tourists who visit the island in the summer months. There is a small museum illustrating the history of D√∫n Aonghasa and its possible functions, while the Aran Sweater Market is also a focal point for visitors who can trace the culture and history associated with the Aran sweater through the on-site museum. Nearby are a Neolithic tomb and a small heritage park at D√∫n Eochla, featuring examples of a traditional thatched cottage and poteen distillery. The Tempull Breccain (Church of Brecan), commonly called the Seven Churches of Aran, is a complex of churches and other buildings dedicated to the 5th-century Saint Brecan, once a popular destination for pilgrims. In the centre of the island, at its highest point is the Inishmore Lighthouse, it was decommissioned in 1857 and replaced by the lights at Eeragh and Inisheer. The island plays host to Ted Fest each year. Established in 2004 it is a celebration of the television sitcom Father Ted. Festival goers dress as their favourite characters, watch their favourite episodes and take part in various Ted related events and competitions. Sport Some of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers. Diving is possible. A particularly popular location for this is Poll na bP√©ist (hole of worms/sea monsters), located at the southern coast of the island, which is a large naturally formed rectangular pool communicating via underground channels with the sea. Since 2012 Inis M√≥r has hosted an event as part of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series. Transport The island is serviced by Aran Ferries ferry from Rossaveal and Doolin. These are passenger-only ferries; cars and heavy goods are transported on unscheduled services. Aer Arann Islands runs daily scheduled flights from Inis M√≥r Aerodrome to Connemara Airport using Britten Norman Islander aircraft. In popular culture The island features heavily in Martin McDonagh's play The Lieutenant of Inishmore. Inis M√≥r was used as a recording location for the 1997 film The Matchmaker and the 2010 film Leap Year. The first story in These Precious Hours by Michel Corrigan has a scene set on Inis M√≥r. The island appeared on the premiere episode of The Amazing Race 12 with teams needing to find Teampall Bhean√°in after they arrived. The music video for Dermot Kennedy's \\"For Island Fires and Family\\" (video released 10 January 2019) was filmed entirely on Inis M√≥r.

A conditional factor demand function expresses the conditional factor demand as a function of the output level and the input costs.Varian, Hal., 1992, Microeconomic Analysis 3rd Ed., W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. New York. The conditional portion of this phrase refers to the fact that this function is conditional on a given level of output, so output is one argument of the function. Typically this concept arises in a long run context in which both labor and capital usage are choosable by the firm, so a single optimization gives rise to conditional factor demands for each of labor and capital. Since the optimal mix of input levels depends on the wage and rental rates, these rates are also arguments of the conditional demand functions for the inputs. This concept is similar to but distinct from the factor demand functions, which give the optimal demands for the inputs when the level of output is free to be chosen; since output is not fixed in that case, output is not an argument of those demand functions. Optimization problem Isocost v. Isoquant Graph With two inputs, say labor and capital, the optimization problem is to minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost can be obtained by using amounts of labor and capital such that the point on the given isoquant is on the lowest possible isocost curve--that is, at the point of tangency between the given isoquant and one of the cost curves. At the tangency the marginal rate of technical substitution between the factors (the absolute value of the slope of the isoquant at the optimal point) equals the relative factor costs (the absolute value of the slope of the isocost curve). This optimization can be formalized as follows: : \\\\text{Minimize}\\\\, wL + rK \\\\, \\\\, \\\\text{with respect to}\\\\,\\\\, L \\\\,\\\\, \\\\text{and} \\\\,\\\\, K, : subject to : f(L, K) = q, where L and K are the chosen quantities of labor and capital, w and r are the fixed unit costs of labor (wage rate) and capital (rental rate) respectively, f is the production function specifying how much output can be produced with any combination of inputs, and q is the fixed level of output required. The resulting factor demand functions are of the general form : L(w, r\\\\,; q) for labor demand, and : K(w, r\\\\,; q). for demand for physical capital. That the wage rate and capital rental rates affect the optimal input quantities can also be seen graphically because they both affect the slope of the isocost curves in the above graph, while the required quantity q of output affects them because it determines the relevant isoquant in the graph. Expansion path As the target level of output is increased, the relevant isoquant becomes farther and farther out from the origin, and still it is optimal in a cost-minimization sense to operate at the tangency point of the relevant isoquant with an isocost curve. The set of all such tangency points is called the firm's expansion path.

But when they all accepted Islam in c.613, Abu Hudhaifah was very angry and teamed up with Abu Jahl, another chief from that clan, to make up a plan to torture them. During a hot and sunny day, he tied them up outside and placed a big stone on top of them. Every day, Abu Jahl forced them to say bad things about Muhammad and say good things about their idol gods.

One day, Yasir was killed because of the extreme pain that they were giving him. The last one was their son, Ammar. They were giving him pain, day and night.

One of the last major battles of the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War, it was fought between Swedish and Imperial armies, each containing around 16,000 men. The more mobile and better led Swedes under Lennart Torstensson effectively destroyed their opponents, commanded by Melchior von Hatzfeldt. However, by this stage of the war, the devastated countryside forced armies to spend much of their time trying to support themselves, and the Swedes were unable to take advantage. By 1646, Imperial forces had regained control of Bohemia; combined with inconclusive campaigns in the Rhineland and Saxony, it was clear a military solution was no longer possible. Fighting continued, as participants tried to improve their positions, but it increased the urgency of negotiations leading to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Background Swedish commander Lennart Torstensson The Thirty Years War began in 1618 when the Protestant dominated Bohemian Estates offered the Crown to fellow Protestant Frederick of the Palatinate, rather than conservative Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II. Most members of the Holy Roman Empire remained neutral, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. An army of the Catholic League, dominated by Bavarians, then invaded the Palatinate and sent Frederick into exile. His replacement by the Catholic Maximilian of Bavaria changed the nature and extent of the war. It drew in Protestant German states like Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, as well as external powers like Denmark-Norway. In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Pomerania, partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the Baltic trade, which provided much of Sweden's income. Economic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, including Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 Treaty of Prague. The war lost much of its religious nature, and changed into a contest between the Empire and Sweden, who was supported by France, and George R√°k√≥czi, Prince of Transylvania. In 1637, Ferdinand III succeeded his father; he began peace talks in 1643, then delayed negotiations, pending a 1644 military offensive. This was unsuccessful; the Swedes defeated the Danes, who had re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at Freiburg in August, the Bavarians under Franz von Mercy could not prevent French troops capturing Philippsburg, and occupying Lorraine. Mercy withdrew into Franconia, establishing winter quarters at Heilbronn. For 1645, Swedish commander Lennart Torstensson proposed a three- part offensive, intended to compel Ferdinand III to agree terms. It envisaged three simultaneous attacks, in order to prevent Imperial forces supporting each other. While France attacked Bavaria, Torstensson would lead his army into Bohemia; they would be joined here by R√°k√≥czi, and their combined force would then move against the Imperial capital, Vienna. While the armies in Bohemia were roughly equal in numbers, the Swedes were far better integrated, and led; despite poor health, Torstensson was an energetic and experienced general, with capable officers. Although Von Hatzfeldt was competent, he lacked the ability to control his subordinates, Von G√∂tzen, and Von Werth. In addition, many of his troops were poorly equipped remnants from defeated armies, his best unit being 5,000 veteran Bavarian cavalry under von Werth. Battle In late January, Torstensson took advantage of the frozen ground to enter Bohemia, near Chomutov. The Imperial army had established winter quarters near Plze≈à; unsure of Swedish intentions, von Hatzfeldt held his position to protect Prague. On 18 February, the Swedes passed to the west, and the two sides spent the next three weeks tracking each other along either side of the Vltava river. In early March, a sudden freeze allowed Torstensson to cross near Star√© Sedlo; von Hatzfeldt followed, reaching T√°bor on 4 March, where he made contact with Swedish cavalry. On 5 March, he withdrew to the hills around Jankov, and prepared for battle the next day. Hatzfeldt selected a strong position; the hills and woods negated the superior Swedish artillery, his centre was protected by a stream, the right by a steep slope and deep forest. His left was the most vulnerable, with open ground directly to its front, overlooked by a hill to the south, known as 'Kappellhodjen' or Chapel Hill. In a conference the night before, Torstensson and his senior officers recognised the drawbacks, but agreed to an assault; their co-ordinated attack contrasted with command failures among the Imperial generals. Werth, whose charges nearly succeeded in preventing defeat The battle consisted of two parts, the first from dawn to midday, the second from early afternoon until nightfall. Around 6:00 am, a Swedish column under Robert Douglas feinted against the Imperial right, while their main force moved around their left. After ordering G√∂tzen to post a detachment on Chapel Hill, Hatzfeldt set off to assess Douglas' move, which he correctly deduced was a diversion. On his return, he discovered G√∂tzen had misinterpreted his orders, moving his entire force towards the hill; it became stuck in the woods and broken ground, giving the Swedes time to install artillery and infantry at the crest. After a furious argument, G√∂tzen launched a series of attacks, which were repulsed with heavy loss; just after 0915, he was killed, and his troops withdrew. Hatzfeldt moved troops from the centre to cover the retreat of G√∂tzen's men, but unlike the lighter Swedish guns, their artillery got stuck in the mud, and were captured by Arvid Wittenberg. Cavalry charges led by Werth kept the Swedes at a safe distance, and the two armies broke contact just before midday. Having cleared the road to Olomouc, Torstensson decided to allow the Imperial army to withdraw, hoping to re-organise his exhausted troops prior to setting off. However, Hatzfeldt felt the Swedes were too close for him to retreat in safety, and opted to hold his position until nightfall. Seeing this, Torstensson moved his guns forward, firing at close range into the helpless Imperial infantry. Werth charged and scattered the Swedish right, before his cavalry stopped to loot the baggage train, where they capturing Torstensson's wife. The Swedish cavalry reformed and counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties; only 1,500 of the 5,000 Bavarians made it back to Munich. Left isolated, the infantry surrendered, with 4,450 taken prisoner, including Hatzfeldt, with another 5,000 killed or wounded; of the 36 regiments involved, only 3,000 men were present in Prague a week later. Swedish losses were around 4,000 in total. Aftermath The failed Swedish-Transylvanian siege of Brno forced Torstensson to retreat Hearing of the defeat, Ferdinand and his brother Archduke Leopold quickly scraped together another army; by early May, Leopold had around 15,000 men. Although it could not match the Swedish veterans, 25 years of constant war had devastated the countryside; armies spent more time foraging, than fighting, drastically reducing their ability to sustain campaigns, or maintain positions. This forced Torstensson into an attempt on the strategically placed town of Brno, which had an Imperial garrison of 1,500 under de Souches, a French Protestant exile. The Swedes were joined there by 14,200 Transylvanian troops; mostly unpaid and unfed, this worsened the supply issues, and the besiegers lost over 8,000 men, from disease, hunger, and desertion. With the opening of the 1645 to 1669 Cretan War, the Ottomans withdrew their support from R√°k√≥czi; in return, Ferdinand renewed the Peace of Zsitvatorok, forcing the Transylvanians to make peace, and lifting the siege of Brno. The end of the Danish war in favour of Sweden encouraged Torstensson to make one last attempt on Vienna, but by October, fewer than 10,000 Swedes faced 20,000 Imperialists. He retreated into Saxony, and relinquished command to Wrangel on 23 December; by February 1646, the Swedes had been totally expelled from Bohemia. However, Ferdinand could not also support his allies in Bavaria and Saxony. While the French campaign in Bavaria ended in stalemate, Torstensson's three part strategy finally proved its worth when K√∂nigsmarck burst into Saxony; without hope of reinforcement, Elector John George agreed a six month truce in September 1645. Accepting a military solution was no longer possible, Ferdinand instructed his representatives at Westphalia to begin serious negotiations.

This shows the popularity of the God in the minds of the people of these districts. Each madappura has its own tradition. One interesting story relating to the God Muthappan is about the Nileshwar Muthappan Madappura. The Sree Muthappan temple near National Highway No 17 in Nileshwar has a rich heritage. It indicates philosophical, devotional and educational importance of Nileshwar. There is an interesting story regarding the construction of Sree Muthappan Temple. An elder member of the Koroth family regularly visited the place now known as the Muthappan temple and drank madhu, a kind of intoxicating drink. He was a famous scholar and got the title Ezhuthachan for his commendable achievement as a teacher. Before drinking madhu, as a devotee he poured several drops of madhu on the nearby jackfruit tree as an offering for the god Muthappan. He regularly repeated the practice. Several years after the death of the above-mentioned scholar the natives found serious problems and they called upon an astrologer for assistance. The astrologer reveal that as a result of the regular practice of giving madhu to the god Muthappan, the God started residing there. After the death of the scholar, he did not get the madhu, and piqued, he started creating disturbances in the area. To placate him, the natives erected a Muthappan temple there. Koroth family got the right of Koymma [ patron] in the temple. As a result of the formation of a committee and the great work done by the members of the committee the temple became famous, and daily hundreds of people visited there. There is a strong belief that the God will cure all diseases and will give prosperity to the devotees. The devotees will get Payakutti from the temple and stood developing as a great temple like the Sree Muthappan temple at Parassini kadavu.

MONUMENTS IN FRANCE ‚Äì page 338 The site of this telescope is near St Matthew's church in the district. The hill there is named for him and is called Halley's Mount. Halley's Observatory was in use from 1677‚Äì1678. Having returned to England in 1678, Halley published Catalogus Stellarum Australium in 1679, which included details of 341 southern stars. These additions to present-day star maps earned him comparison to Tycho Brahe. Halley was subsequently awarded his Master's from Oxford and Fellowship of the Royal Society. In 1686, Halley published the second part of the results from his Helenian expedition, being a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons. In this, he identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. He also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level. His charts were an important contribution to the emerging field of information visualisation. Future Astronomer Nevil Maskelyne visited Saint Helena in 1761 to observe a transit of Venus and built an observatory near the site of Halley's from the previous century. In the 19th/early 20th centuries, an observatory (in use 1840‚Äì1849) was situated in Longwood village and two further observatories were erected in the Hutt's Gate area: one in use from 1892‚Äì1924 and the second in use from 1925‚Äì1975. =Napoleon= Napoleon's Grave Napoleon's Grave (1838) It was the location of Napoleon's second exile from 1815 until his death on 5 May 1821.

It is used in conjunction with the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. It was developed by STAB, an Italian motor manufacturer, who still make the majority of USALS compatible motors. Software on the satellite receiver (or external positioner) calculates the position of all available satellites from an initial location (input by the user), which is the latitude and longitude relative to Earth. Calculated positions can differ ¬±0.1 degrees from the offset. This is adjusted automatically and does not require previous technical knowledge. Compared to DiSEqC 1.2, it is not necessary to manually search and store every known satellite position. Pointing to a known satellite position (for example 19.2¬∫E) is enough; this position will act as the central point, and the USALS system will then calculate visible satellites position within the offset. Receivers are aligned to the satellite most southern to their position in the northern hemisphere, or the northernmost in the southern hemisphere. As it is not an open standard, for a receiver to carry the USALS logo it must undergo a certification test by STAB's laboratories. If successful the manufacturer can include a USALS settings entry in its own menu, as well as place the logo on the front of their unit. However, a large number of manufacturers of both receivers and motors provide compatible modes which have not received certification, leading to use of unofficial terms. USALS is a program and not a communication protocol. The USALS calculates the dish angular position given by the dish longitude/latitude and the position of the satellite in geostationary orbit. It then sends the angular position to the positioner using the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. This calculation is straight on using geometric calculations.

It is not a single rite but a family of rites within the Latin Church, which comprised the majority use of most of Western Christianity for the greater part of the 1st millennium AD. The rites first developed in the early centuries as the Syriac-Greek rites of Jerusalem and Antioch and were first translated into Latin in various parts of the Western Roman Empire Praetorian prefecture of Gaul. By the 5th century, it was well established in the Roman civil diocese of Gaul, an early center of Christianity. Ireland too is known to have had a form of this Gallican Liturgy mixed with Celtic customs. History and origin The Gallican Rite was used from before the 5th century, and likely prior to the Diocletian reform in AD 293 Roman Gaul, until the middle or end of the 8th century. There is no information before the 5th century and very little then; and throughout the whole period there was, to judge by existing documents and descriptions, so much diversity that, though the general outlines of the rite were of the same pattern, the name must not be taken to imply more than a very moderate amount of homogeneity. The Rite of Iberia was used from the 5th century in Roman provinces within the Roman civil diocese of Hispania to the end of the 11th century, and lingered as an archaeological survival in chapels at Toledo and Salamanca. It was so nearly allied to the Gallican Rite that the term Hispano- Gallican is often applied to the two. But the Iberian Mozarabic Rite has, like the allied Celtic Rite, enough of an independent history to require separate treatment, so that though it will be necessary to allude to both by way of illustration, this article will be devoted primarily to the rite once used in what is now France. Of the origin of the Gallican Rite there are three principal theories, between two of which the controversy is not yet settled. These theories may be termed: the Ephesine, the Ambrosian, and the Roman. =Ephesine theory= The Ephesine theory, first put forward by William Palmer in Origines Liturgicae, was once very popular among Anglican scholars. According to it the Gallican Rite went back to one brought to Lyon from Ephesus by St. Pothinus and Irenaeus, who had received it through Polycarp from John of Patmos. The idea originated partly in a statement in the 8th- century tract in a manuscript, which refers the Service of the Gauls (Cursus Gallorum) to such an origin, and partly in a statement of Colm√°n of Lindisfarne at the Synod of Whitby (664) respecting the Johannine origin of the Quartodeciman Easter. This theory \\"may be dismissed as practically disproved,\\" according to Henry Jenner, in Catholic Encyclopedia. =Ambrosian theory= The second theory is that which Louis Duchesne puts forward in place of the Ephesine. He holds that Milan, not Lugdunum (Lyon), was the principal centre of Gallican development. He lays great stress on the incontestable importance of Mediolanum (Milan) as the capital of the Western Roman Empire from 286 to 402 and of the Church of Milan in the late 4th century, and conjectures that a liturgy of Oriental origin, introduced perhaps by Auxentius the Arian bishop of Milan from 355 to 374, spread from the capital city, Mediolanum, to the Roman provinces in Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia. Duchesne points out that \\"the Gallican Liturgy in the features which distinguish it from the Roman, betrays all the characteristics of the Eastern Orthodox liturgies,\\" and that \\"some of its formularies are to be found word for word in the Greek Orthodox texts which were in use in the Churches of the Syro- Byzantine Rite either in the fourth century or somewhat later,\\" and infers from this that, \\"the Gallican Liturgy is an Oriental liturgy, introduced into the West towards the middle of the fourth century.\\" Duchesne does not, however, note that in certain other important peculiarities the Gallican Liturgy agrees with the Roman where the latter differs from the Oriental. Controverting the third or Roman theory of origin, he stresses that Pope Innocent I (416) in a letter to Decentius, bishop of Gubbio, spoke of usages which Duchesne recognizes as Gallican (e.g. the position of the Diptychs and the Pax) as \\"foreign importations\\" and did not recognize in them the ancient usage of his own Church, and he thinks it hard to explain why the African Church should have accepted the Roman reforms, while Ambrose himself a Roman, refused them. He assumes that the Ambrosian Rite is not really Roman, but Gallican, much Romanized at a later period, and that the Gubbio variations of which Innocent I complained were borrowed from Milan. =Roman theory= The third theory is perhaps rather complicated to state without danger of misrepresentation, and has not been so definitely stated as the other two by any one writer. It is held in part by Milanese liturgists and by many others whose opinion is of weight. In order to state it clearly it will be necessary to point out first certain details in which all the Latin or Western rites agree with one another in differing from the Eastern, and in this we speak only of the Mass, which is of far more importance than either the canonical hours or the occasional services in determining origins. Invariability of the Priest's Part The Eastern Eucharists of whatever rite are marked by the invariability of the priest's part. There are, it is true, alternative anaphoras which are used either ad libitum, as in the Syro-Jacobite Rite, or on certain days, as in Byzantine and East Syrian, but they are complete in themselves and do not contain passages appropriate to the day. The lections of course vary with the day in all rites, and varying antiphons, troparia, etc., are sung by the choir; but the priest's part remains fixed. In the Western rites ‚Äì whether Hispano-Gallican, Ambrosian, or Roman ‚Äì a very large proportion of the priest's part varies according to the day, and these variations are so numerous in the Gallican Rite that the fixed part, even of the Prayer of the Consecration, is strangely little. Certain varying prayers of the Hispano-Gallican Rite have a tendency to fall into couples, a Bidding Prayer, or invitation to pray, sometimes of considerable length and often partaking of the nature of a homily, addressed to the congregation, and a collect embodying the suggestions of the Bidding Prayer, addressed to God. These Bidding Prayers have survived in the Roman Rite in the Good Friday intercessory prayers, and they occur in a form borrowed later from the Gallican in the ordination services, but in general the invitation to prayer is reduced to its lowest terms in the word Oremus. The Institution Another Western peculiarity is in the form of the Words of Institution. The principal Eastern liturgies follow Paul the Apostle's words in the First Epistle to the Corinthians () and date the Institution by the betrayal, and of the less important anaphoras, most either use the same expression or paraphrase it. The Western liturgies date from the Passion, Qui pridie quam pateretur, for which, though of course the fact is found there, there is no verbal Scriptural warrant. The Mozarabic of today uses the Pauline words, and no Gallican Recital of the Institution remains in full; but in both the prayer that follows is called (with alternative nomenclature in the Gallican) post- Pridie and the catchwords \\"Qui pridie\\" come at the end of the post-Sanctus in the Gallican Masses, so that it is clear that this form existed in both. These variations from the Eastern usages are of an early date, and it is inferred from them, and from other considerations more historical than liturgical, that a liturgy with these peculiarities was the common property of Gaul, Hispania, and Italy. Whether, as is most likely, it originated in Rome and spread thence to the countries under direct Roman influence, or whether it originated elsewhere and was adopted by Rome, there is no means of knowing. The adoption must have happened when liturgies were in rather a fluid state. The Gallicans may have carried to an extreme the changes begun at Rome, and may have retained some archaic features which had been later dropped by Rome. During the 4th century ‚Äì it has been conjectured that it was in the papacy of Pope Damasus I (366‚Äì384) ‚Äì liturgical reforms were made at Rome: the position of the Great Intercession and of the Pax were altered, the latter perhaps because the form of the dismissal of the catechumens was disused, and the distinction between the first part, the Mass of the Catechumens, and second part, the Mass of the Faithful, was no longer needed, and therefore the want was felt of a position with some meaning to it for the sign of Christian unity. The long and diffuse prayers were made into the short and crisp collects of the Roman type. It was then that the variable post-Sanctus and post-Pridie were altered into a fixed Canon of a type similar to the Roman Canon of today, though perhaps this Canon began with the clause which now reads \\"Quam oblationem\\", but according to the pseudo-Ambrosian tract De Sacramentis once read \\"Fac nobis hanc oblationem\\". This may have been introduced by a short, variable post-Sanctus. This reform, possibly through the influence of Ambrose, was adopted at Milan, but not in Gaul and Hispania. At a still later period, during the 5th and 6th centuries, changes were again made at Rome, principally attributed to Pope Leo I, Pope Gelasius I, and Pope Gregory I; these three popes are the eponyms of three varying sacramentaries. These later reforms were not adopted at Milan which retained the books of the first reform, which are now known as Ambrosian. =Summary of origins= Hence it may be seen that, roughly speaking, the Western or Latin Liturgy went through three phases, which may be called for want of better names the Gallican, the Ambrosian, and the Roman stages. The holders of the theory no doubt recognize that the demarcation between these stages is rather vague, and that the alterations were in many respects gradual. Of the three theories of origin, the Ephesine may be dismissed as practically disproved. To both of the other two the same objection may be urged, that they are largely founded on conjecture and on the critical examination of documents of a much later date than the periods to which the conjectures relate. But at present there is little else to go upon. It may be well to mention also a theory put forward by W. C. Bishop in Church Quarterly for July 1908, to the effect that the Gallican Liturgy was not introduced into Gaul from anywhere but was the original liturgy of that country, apparently invented and developed there. He speaks of an original independence of Rome (of course liturgically only) followed by later borrowings. This does not seem to exclude the idea that Rome and the West may have had the germ of the Western Rite in common. Again the theory is conjectural and is only very slightly stated in the article. =Later history of the Gallican Rite= The later history of the Gallican Rite until the time of its abolition as a separate rite is obscure. In Hispania there was a definite centre in Toledo whose influence was felt over the whole peninsula, even after the coming of the Moors. Hence it was that the Hispanic Rite was much more regulated than the Gallican, and Toledo at times, though not very successfully, tried to give liturgical laws even to Gaul, though probably only to the Visigothic part of it. In the greater part of France there was liturgical anarchy. There was no capital to give laws to the whole country, and the rite developed there variously in different places, so that among the scanty fragments of the service-books that remain there is a marked absence of verbal uniformity, though the main outlines of the services are of the same type. Several councils attempted to regulate matters a little, but only for certain episcopal provinces. Among these were the Councils of Vannes (465), Agde (506), Vaison (529), Tours (567), Auxerre (578), and the two Councils of M√¢con (581, 623). But all along there went on a certain process of Romanization due to the constant applications to the Holy See for advice, and there is also another complication in the probable introduction during the 7th century, through Columbanus's missionaries, of elements of Irish origin. The changes in the Roman Rite happened rather gradually during the course of the late 7th and 8th century, and seem synchronous with the rise of the Mayors of the Palace, and their development into kings of France. Nearly all the Gallican books of the later Merovingian period, which are all that are left, contain many Roman elements. In some cases there is reason to suppose that the Roman Canon was first introduced into an otherwise Gallican Mass, but the so- called Gelasian Sacramentary, the principal manuscript of which is attributed to the Abbey of St. Denis and the early 8th century, is an avowedly Roman book, though containing Gallican additions and adaptations. And the same may be said of what is left of the undoubtedly Frankish book known as the Missale Francorum of the same date. Duchesne attributes a good deal of this 8th- century Romanizing tendency to Boniface, though he shows that it had begun before his day. The Roman Liturgy was adopted at Metz in the time of Chrodegang (742‚Äì66). The Roman chant was introduced about 760, and by a decree of Pepin of Herstal, Mayor of the Palace, quoted in Charlemagne's Admonitio generalis in 789, the Gallican chant was abolished in its favour. Pope Adrian I between 784 and 791 sent to Charlemagne at his own request a copy of what was considered to be the Gregorian Sacramentary, but which certainly represented the Roman use of the end of the 8th century. This book, which was far from complete, was edited and supplemented by the addition of a large amount of matter derived from the Gallican books and from the Roman book known as the Gelasian Sacramentary, which had been gradually supplanting the Gallican. It is probable that the editor was Alcuin of York, Charlemagne's principal liturgical advisor. Copies were distributed throughout Charlemagne's empire, and this \\"composite liturgy\\", as Duchesne describes, \\"from its source in the Imperial chapel spread throughout all the churches of the Frankish Empire and at length, finding its way to Rome gradually supplanted there the ancient use.\\" More than half a century later, when Charles the Bald wished to see what the ancient Gallican Rite had been like, it was necessary to import Hispanic priests to celebrate it in his presence. Subsequently, with the Normans the Gallican rite in the Kingdom of Sicily is the official liturgy. =Other uses of the name Gallican= The name Gallican has also been applied to two other uses: *a French use introduced by the Normans into Apulia and Sicily. This was only a variant of the Roman Rite. *the reformed Breviaries of the French dioceses in the 17th to mid-19th centuries. These have nothing to do with the ancient Gallican Rite. Manuscripts and other sources There are no manuscripts of the Gallican Rite earlier than the later part of the 7th century, though the descriptions in the letters of Germain of Paris (555‚Äì76) take one back another century. The known manuscripts are: =Reichenau Fragments= The Reichenau fragments are described in L√©opold Victor Delisle's M√©moire sur d'anciens Sacramentaires. They were discovered by Franz Mone in 1850 in a palimpsest manuscript from the Abbey of Reichenau, in the library of Karlsruhe. The manuscript, which is late 7th century, had belonged to (760‚Äì781). It contains eleven Masses of purely Gallican type, one of which is a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre, but the others do not specify any festival. One Mass is written entirely in hexameter verse, except for the post-Pridie which is prose. =Peyron, Mai, and Bunsen Fragments= The Peyron, Mai, and Bunsen fragments are disjointed palimpsest leaves. Those fragments which are eponyms of Cardinal Angelo Mai and were found in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan, and those fragments which are an eponym of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen were found at the Abbey of Saint Gall. The Peyron fragment contains part of what looks like a Lenten Contestatio (Preface) with other prayers of Gallican type. The Bunsen fragment contains part of a Mass for the Dead (post-Sanctus, post-Pridie) and several pairs of Bidding Prayers and Collects, the former having the title \\"Exhortatio\\" or \\"Exhortatio Matutina\\". The Mai fragments begin with part of a Bidding Prayer and contain a fragment of a Contestatio, with that title, and fragments of other prayers, two of which have the title \\"Post Nomina\\", and two others which seem to be prayers ad Pacem. =Missale Gallicanum Vetus= The Missale Gallicanum Vetus (Gallicanum), described by Delisle, is a manuscript dating from the end of the 7th, or the early part of the 8th. Only a fragment, it begins with a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre, after which come prayers for the Blessing of Virgins and Widows, two Advent Masses, the Christmas Eve Mass, the expositio symboli and traditio symboli and other ceremonies preparatory to Baptism; also the Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday ceremonies and the baptismal service, Masses for the Sundays after Easter up to the Rogation Mass, where the manuscript breaks off. Masses, as in Gothicum, are Gallican in order with many Roman prayers. The Good Friday prayers are, with a few verbal variations, exactly as those in the Roman Missal. =Missale Gothicum= Missale Gothicum (Gothicum), described by Delisle, is a manuscript dating from the end of the 7th century and once belonging to the Petau Library. The name is due to a 15th-century note at the beginning of the book, and hence it has been attributed by Tommasi and Jean Mabillon to Narbonne, which was in the Visigothic Kingdom. Duchesne, judging by the inclusion of Masses for the feast of Symphorian and the feast of Leodegar (d. 680), attributes it to Autun. Masses are numbered, the manuscript beginning with Christmas Eve which is numbered III. Probably there were once two Advent Masses, as in Gallicanum. There are eighty-one numbered sections, of which the last is the first prayer of \\"Missa Romensif cottidiana\\", with which the manuscript breaks off. The details of Masses in this book are given in the section of the present article on the liturgical year. Masses are all Gallican as to order, but many of the actual prayers are Roman. =Luxeuil Lectionary= The Luxeuil Lectionary (Luxeuil) is a 7th-century manuscript discovered by Mabillon in the Abbey of Luxeuil, but because among its very few saints' days it contains the feast of Saint Genevieve, Germain Morin, it has been attributed to Paris. It contains the Prophetical Lessons, epistles, and Gospels for the year from Christmas Eve onwards. At the end are the lessons of a few special Masses, for the burial of a bishop, for the dedication of a church, when a bishop preaches, \\"et plebs decimas reddat\\", when a deacon is ordained, when a priest is blessed, \\"in profectione itineris\\", and \\"lectiones cotidianae\\". This lectionary is purely Gallican with no apparent Roman influence. The manuscript has not been printed in its entirety, but Mabillon, in De Liturgia Gallicana, gives references to all the lessons and the beginnings and endings of the text. =Letters of St. Germanus of Paris= The Letters of St. Germanus of Paris are from a manuscript at Autun. There appears to be no reason to doubt that they are genuine. They contain mystical interpretations of the ceremonies of the Mass and of other services. Duchesne says of the descriptions, on which the interpretations are based, that \\"We may reconstruct from the letters a kind of Ordo Gallicanus\\". =Celtic books= Much side light is thrown on the Gallican Rite by the Celtic books, especially by the Stowe Missal and Bobbio Missal. The latter has been called Gallican and attributed to the Province of Besan√ßon, but it is now held to be Irish in a much Romanized form, though of Continental provenance, being quite probably from the originally Irish Bobbio Abbey, where Mabillon found it. A comparison with the Ambrosian Liturgy and Rite may also be of service, while most lacunae in our knowledge of the Gallican Rite may reasonably be conjecturally filled up from the Mozarabic books, which even in their present form are those of substantially the same rite. There are also liturgical allusions in certain 5th and 6th century writers: Hilary of Poitiers, Sulpicius Severus, Caesarius of Arles, and especially Gregory of Tours, and some information may be gathered from the decrees of the Gallican councils mentioned above. The above are all that exist as directly Gallican sources, but much information may also be gleaned from the books of the transition period, which, though substantially Roman, were much edited with Germanic tendencies and contained a large amount which was of a Gallican rather than a Roman type. The principal of these are as follows. =Gelasian Sacramentary= There are three extant manuscripts of the Gelasian Sacramentary, one at Vatican City, one at Z√ºrich, and one at the Abbey of Saint Gall. The manuscripts are of the early 8th century. The groundwork is Roman, with Gallican additions and modifications. Evidence for the Gallican rites of ordination and some other matters is derived from this book. =Missale Francorum= The Missale Francorum (Vat. Reg. Lat. 257) is a fragment of a sacramentary similar to the Gelasian Sacramentary, though not identical with it. =Gregorian Sacramentary= There are many manuscripts of the Gregorian Sacramentary. It represents the sacramentary sent by Adrian I to Charlemagne, after it had been rearranged and supplemented by Gelasian and Gallican editions in France. The Liturgical Year The Luxeuil Lectionary, Missale Gothicum and Missale Gallicum, and the Gallican adaptations of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum are the chief authorities on this point, and to these may be added some information to be gathered from the regulations of the Council of Agde (506), Fourth Council of Orl√©ans (541), Council of Tours (567), and Second Council of M√¢con (581), and from Gregory of Tours' Historia Francorum, as to the Gallican practice in the 6th century. It is probable that there were many variations in different times and places, and that the influence of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum brought about gradual assimilation to Rome. The year, as is usual, began with Advent. The Council of M√¢con arranged three fasting days a week during Advent and mentioned St. Martin's Day as the key-day for Advent Sunday, so that, as a present in the Mozarabic and Ambrosian Rites, there were six Sundays of Advent (but only two Advent Masses survive in Gallicanum). Gothicum and the Luxeuil Lectionary both begin with Christmas Eve. Both books also have Commons of Martyrs and Confessors, the Luxeuil has Commons of bishops and deacons for a number of other Masses, and Gothicum has six Sunday Masses. Gallicanum has a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre before the two Advent Masses. In both Gothicum and Gallicanum a large space is given to the services of the two days before Easter, and in the latter the expositio symboli and traditio symboli are given at great length. The moveable feasts depended, of course, on Easter. When the Roman Church altered the Easter computation from the old 84-year-cycle to the new Victorius Aquitaine 532-year-cycle in 457, the Gallican Church, unlike the Celts, did the same; but when, in 525, the Roman Church adopted the Dionysius Exiguus 19-year-cycle, the Gallican Church continued to use the 532-year-cycle, until the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century. Lent began with the first Sunday, not with Ash Wednesday. There is a not very intelligible passage in the canons of the Council of Tours to the effect that all through August there were \\"festivitates et missae sanctorum\\", but this is not borne out by the existing sacramentaries or the Lectionary. The Divine Office There is curiously little information on this point, and it is not possible to reconstruct the Gallican Divine Office from the scanty allusions that exist. It seems probable that there was considerable diversity in various times and places, though councils, both in Gaul and Hispania, tried to bring about some uniformity. The principal authorities are the Councils of Agde (506) and Tours (567) and allusions in the writings of Gregory of Tours and Caesarius of Arles. The general arrangement and nomenclature were very similar to those of the Celtic Rite. There were two principal services, Matins and Vespers; and four Lesser Hours, Prime, or ad Secundum, Terce, Sext, and None; and probably two night services, Complin, or ad initium noctis, and Nocturns. But the application of these names is sometimes obscure. It is not quite clear whether Nocturns and Lauds were not joined together as Matins; Caesarius speaks of Prima, while Gallicanum speaks of ad Secundum; Caesarius distinguishes between Lucernarium and ad Duodeciman, while Aurelian distinguishes between ad Duodeciman and Complin; Gothicum speaks of Vespera Paschae and Initium Noctis Paschae, and Gallicanum has ad Duodeciman Paschae. The distribution of the Psalter is not known. The Council of Tours orders six psalms at Sext and twelve ad Duodecimam, with Alleluia (presumably as Antiphon). For Matins there is a curious arrangement which reminds one of that in the Rule of St. Columbanus. Normally in summer (apparently from Easter to July) \\"sex antiphonae binis psalmis\\" are ordered. This evidently means twelve psalms, two under each antiphon. In August there seem to have been no psalms, because there were festivals and Masses of saints. \\"Toto Augusto manicationes fiant, quia festivitates sunt et missae sanctorum.\\" The meaning of manicationes and of the whole statement is obscure. In September there were fourteen psalms, two under each antiphon; in October twenty-four psalms, three to each antiphon; and from December to Easter thirty psalms, three to each antiphon. Caesarius orders six psalms at Prime with the hymn \\"Fulgentis auctor aetheris\\", two lessons, one from the old and one from the New Testament, and a capitellum\\"; six psalms at Terce, Sext, and None, with an antiphon, a hymn, a lesson, and a capitellum; at Lucernarium a \\"Psalmus Directaneus\\", whatever that may be (cf. \\"Psalmus Directus\\" of the Ambrosian Rite), two antiphons, a hymn, and a capitellum; and ad Duodecimam, eighteen psalms, an antiphon, hymn, lesson, and capitellum. From this it seems as though the office of Lucernarium and ad Duodecimam made up Vespers, combining the twelfth hour of the Divine Office (that is, of the recitation of the Psalter with its accompaniments) with a service for what, without any intention of levity, one may call \\"lighting-up time\\". The Ambrosian and Mozarabic Vespers are constructed on this principle, and so is the Byzantine Hesperinos. Caesarius mentions a blessing given by the bishop at the end of Lucernarium, \\"cumque expleto Lucernario benedictionem populo dedisset\\". The rules of Caesarius and Aurelian both speak of two nocturns with lessons, which include on the feasts of martyrs lessons from their passions. They order Magnificat to be sung at Lauds and during the Paschal days, and Gloria in excelsis Deo sung on Sundays and greater festivals. There is a short passage which throws a little light upon the Lyon use of the end of the 5th century in an account of the Council of Lyon in 499. The council, assembled by Gundobad, king of Burgundy, began on the This began with a lesson from the Pentateuch, . Then psalms were sung and a lesson was read from the prophets (,), more psalms and a lesson from the Gospels, or , and a lesson from the Pauline epistles, . Agobard, in the 9th century, mentions that at Lyon there were no canticles except from the Psalms, no hymns written by poets, and no lessons except from Scripture. Mabillon says that though in his day Lyon agreed with Rome in many things, especially in the distribution of the Psalter, and admitted lessons from the Acts of the Saints, there were still no hymns except at Complin, and he mentions a similar rule as to hymns at Vienne. But the 767 Council of Tours canon 23 allowed the use of the Ambrosian hymns. Though the Psalter of the second recension of Jerome, now used in all the churches of the Roman Rite except St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, is known as the \\"Gallican\\", while the older, is known as the \\"Roman\\", it does not seem that the Gallican Psalter was used even in Gaul until a comparatively later date, though it spread thence over nearly all the West. At present the Mozarabic and Ambrosian Psalters are variants of the \\"Roman\\", with peculiarities of their own. Probably the decadence of the Gallican Divine Office was very gradual. In an 8th-century manuscript tract, the Cursus Gallorum is distinguished from the Cursus Romanorum, the Cursus Scottorum and the Ambrosian, all of which seem to have been going on then. The unknown writer, though his opinion is of no value on the origin of the cursus, may well have known about some of these of his own knowledge; but through the 7th century there are indications of adoption of the Roman or the Monastic cursus instead of the Gallican, or to mix them up, a tendency which was resisted at times by provincial councils. The Mass The chief authorities for the Gallican Mass are the letters of Saint Germanus of Paris (555‚Äì576), and by a comparison of these with the extant sacramentaries, not only of Gaul but of the Celtic Rite, with the Irish tracts on the Mass, with the books of the still existing Mozarabic Rite, and with the descriptions of the Hispanic Mass given by Isidore of Seville. One may arrive at a fairly clear and general idea of the service, though there exists no Gallican Ordinary of the Mass and no Antiphoner. Duchesne, in Origines du Culte chr√©tien, gave a very full account constructed on this basis, though some will differ from him in his supplying certain details from Ambrosian books, and in his claiming the Bobbio Missal Sacramentary as Ambrosian rather than Celtic. Jenner's analysis shows that the Gallican Mass contained a very small number of fixed elements and that nearly the whole service was variable according to the day. The absence of an Ordinary of the Mass is, therefore, of less importance than it would be in, for instance, the Roman Mass or the Ambrosian Mass. Thus the fixed parts of the service would only be: (a) the three Canticles, (b) the Ajus and Sanctus, etc., at the Gospel, (c) the Prex, (d) the Dismissal, (e) the priest's prayers at the Offertory, (f) the Great Intercession, (g) the Pax formula, (h) the Sursum corda dialogue, (i) the Sanctus, (j) the Recital of the Institution, (k) the Lord's Prayer. Possibly fixed would be the Confractorium, Trecanum, and Communio. and probably fixed would be the priest's devotions at Communion. Most of these are very short and only the most important passage wanting is the one fixed passage in the Prayer of Consecration, the Words of Institution. The Occasional Services =The Baptismal Service= The authorities for the Gallican Baptismal Service are Gothicum and Gallicanum, both of which are incomplete, along with a few details in the second Letter of Germanus of Paris. The forms given in the Stowe Missal and the Bobbio Missal are too much Romanized to well illustrate the Gallican Rite. The form given in Gothicum is the least complete. Gallicanum has a much fuller form with the traditio symboli and expositio symboli, etc. The Holy Week ceremonies which are mixed with the Baptismal service in the two books are not very characteristic. The couplets of invitatory and collect which occur in the Roman Good Friday service are given with verbal variations in Gothicum; in both, however, there are other prayers of a similar type and prayers for some of the Hours of Good Friday and Easter Vigil. The Blessing of the Paschal Candle consists of a Bidding Prayer and collect (in Gothicum only), the Exsultet and its Preface nearly exactly as in the Roman, a Collectio post benedictionem cerei, and Collectio post hymnum cerri. There is no blessing of the new fire in either. =Ordination Service= The Ordination services of the Gallican Rite do not occur in any of the avowedly Gallican books. They are found in the Gelasian Sacramentary and the Missale Francorum. That is to say, a mixed form which does not agree with the more or less contemporary Roman form in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, though it contains some Roman prayers, is found in these two books, and it may reasonably be inferred that the differences are of Gallican origin. Moreover, extracts relating to ceremonial are given with them from the Statuta Ecclesia Antiqua, formerly attributed to the Fourth Council of Carthage, but now known to be a Gallican decree \\"promulgated in the province of Arles towards the end of the 5th century\\" (Duchesne). The ceremonial contained therein agrees with that described in De Officiis Ecclesiasticis by Isidore of Seville. The forms of minor orders, including subdeacon, were very short, and consisted simply of the delivery of the instruments: keys to the porters; books of lectors and exorcists; cruets to acolytes; chalice, paten, basin, ewer and towel to subdeacons. Bidding Prayers and all are in the Roman Pontifical of today. In the ordination of deacons there is a form which is found in the Byzantine Rite but has not been adopted in the Roman Rite, the recognition by the people, after an address, with the cry of Dignus est! This is used for priests and bishops also, for example, the Axios acclamation in Byzantine ordinations. The Bidding Prayer and collect which follow are both in the present Roman Pontifical, though separated by much additional matter. The ordination of priests was of the same type as that of deacons, with the addition of the anointing of the hands. The address, with a varied end, and the collect (but not the Bidding Prayer), and the anointing of the hands with its formula are in the modern Roman Pontifical, but with very large additions. The consecration of bishops began, after an election, with a presentation and recognition, neither of which is in the modern Pontifical. Then followed a long Bidding Prayer, also not adopted in the Roman Rite, and the Consecration Prayer Deus omnium honorum, part of which is embodied in the Preface in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, and in the present Pontifical. During this prayer two bishops held the Book of the Gospels over the candidate, and all the bishops laid their hands on his head. Then followed the anointing of the hands, but apparently not of the head as in the modern rite, with a formula which is not in the Roman books. =The Consecration of a church= The Consecration of a church does not occur in the recognized Gallican books and from prayers in the Gelasian Sacramentary and Missale Francorum. Duchesne's analysis of both rites shows, in Christian worship, that at a time when the Roman Rite of Consecration was exclusively funerary and contained little else but the deposition of the relics, as shown in the Ordines Romani in the Saint-Amand Abbey manuscript, the Gallican Rite resembled more closely that of the modern Pontifical, which may be presumed to have borrowed from it. A 9th century commentary on the ritual of a dedication, attributed by Edmond Mart√®ne to Remigius of Auxerre, and the 8th or 9th century Angoul√™me Sacramentary manuscript are the other authorities from which Duchesne derives his details. The order of the Celtic Consecration given in the An Leabhar Breac is very similar.

It involved groups of people dancing erratically, sometimes thousands at a time. The mania affected men, women, and children who danced until they collapsed from exhaustion. One of the first major outbreaks was in Aachen, in the Holy Roman Empire (in modern-day Germany), in 1374, and it quickly spread throughout Europe; one particularly notable outbreak occurred in Strasbourg in 1518 in Alsace, also in the Holy Roman Empire (now France). Affecting thousands of people across several centuries, dancing mania was not an isolated event, and was well documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood, and remedies were based on guesswork. Often musicians accompanied dancers, due to a belief that music would treat the mania, but this tactic sometimes backfired by encouraging more to join in. There is no consensus among modern-day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.Sirois, F. (1982). Perspectives on epidemic hysteria. In M. J. Colligan, J. W. Pennebaker, & L. R. Murphy (eds.), Mass psychogenic illness: A social psychological analysis (pp. 217‚Äì236). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. The several theories proposed range from religious cults being behind the processions to people dancing to relieve themselves of stress and put the poverty of the period out of their minds. It is speculated to have been a mass psychogenic illness, in which physical symptoms with no known physical cause are observed to affect a group of people, as a form of social influence. Definition \\"Dancing mania\\" is derived from the term \\"choreomania\\", from the Greek choros (dance) and mania (madness),Bartholomew. and is also known as \\"dancing plague.\\"Dirk Blom. The term was coined by Paracelsus, and the condition was initially considered a curse sent by a saint, usually St. John the BaptistMidelfort. or St. Vitus, and was therefore known as \\"St. Vitus' Dance\\" or \\"St. John's Dance\\". Victims of dancing mania often ended their processions at places dedicated to that saint, who was prayed to in an effort to end the dancing; incidents often broke out around the time of the feast of St. Vitus.Marks. St. Vitus' Dance was diagnosed, in the 17th century, as Sydenham chorea. Dancing mania has also been known as epidemic chorea and epidemic dancing. A disease of the nervous system, chorea is characterized by symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, which has also rather unconvincingly been considered a form of epilepsy. Scientists have described dancing mania as a \\"collective mental disorder\\", \\"collective hysterical disorder\\" and \\"mass madness\\". Outbreaks The earliest-known outbreak of dancing mania occurred in the 7th century, and it reappeared many times across Europe until about the 17th century, when it stopped abruptly. One of the earliest-known incidents occurred sometime in the 1020s in Bernburg, where 18 peasants began singing and dancing around a church, disturbing a Christmas Eve service. Further outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about ), jumping and dancing all the way, in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a legend that originated at around the same time. Another incident, in 1278, involved about 200 people dancing on a bridge over the River Meuse resulting in its collapse. Many of the survivors were restored to full health at a nearby chapel dedicated to St. Vitus. The first major outbreak of the mania occurred between 1373 and 1374, with incidents reported in England, Germany and the Netherlands. On 24 June 1374, one of the biggest outbreaks began in Aachen, (Germany), before spreading to other places such as Cologne, Flanders, Franconia, Hainaut, Metz, Strasbourg, Tongeren, Utrecht, and countries such as Italy and Luxembourg. Further episodes occurred in 1375 and 1376, with incidents in France, Germany and Netherlands, and in 1381 there was an outbreak in Augsburg. Further incidents occurred in 1418 in Strasbourg, where people fasted for days and the outbreak was possibly caused by exhaustion. In another outbreak, in 1428 in Schaffhausen, a monk danced to death and, in the same year, a group of women in Zurich were reportedly in a dancing frenzy. Another of the biggest outbreaks occurred in July 1518, in Strasbourg (see Dancing plague of 1518), where a woman began dancing in the street and between 50 and 400 people joined her. Further incidents occurred during the 16th century, when the mania was at its peak: in 1536 in Basel, involving a group of children; and in 1551 in Anhalt, involving just one man. In the 17th century, incidents of recurrent dancing were recorded by professor of medicine Gregor Horst, who noted: Dancing mania appears to have completely died out by the mid-17th century. According to John Waller, although numerous incidents were recorded, the best documented cases are the outbreaks of 1374 and 1518, for which there is abundant contemporary evidence. Characteristics The outbreaks of dancing mania varied, and several characteristics of it have been recorded. Generally occurring in times of hardship, up to tens of thousands of people would appear to dance for hours, days, weeks, and even months. Women have often been portrayed in modern literature as the usual participants in dancing mania, although contemporary sources suggest otherwise. Whether the dancing was spontaneous, or an organised event, is also debated. What is certain, however, is that dancers seemed to be in a state of unconsciousness, and unable to control themselves. In his research into social phenomena, author Robert Bartholomew notes that contemporary sources record that participants often did not reside where the dancing took place. Such people would travel from place to place, and others would join them along the way. With them they brought customs and behaviour that were strange to the local people. Bartholomew describes how dancers wore \\"strange, colorful attire\\" and \\"held wooden sticks\\". Robert Marks, in his study of hypnotism, notes that some decorated their hair with garlands. However, not all outbreaks involved foreigners, and not all were particularly calm. Bartholomew notes that some \\"paraded around naked\\" and made \\"obscene gestures\\". Some even had sexual intercourse. Others acted like animals, and jumped, hopped and leaped about. They hardly stopped, and some danced until they broke their ribs and subsequently died. Throughout, dancers screamed, laughed, or cried, and some sang.Vuillier. Bartholomew also notes that observers of dancing mania were sometimes treated violently if they refused to join in. Participants demonstrated odd reactions to the color red; in A History of Madness in Sixteenth-Century Germany, Midelfort notes they \\"could not perceive the color red at all\\", and Bartholomew reports \\"it was said that dancers could not stand... the color red, often becoming violent on seeing [it]\\". Bartholomew also notes that dancers \\"could not stand pointed shoes\\", and that dancers enjoyed their feet being hit. Throughout, those affected by dancing mania suffered from a variety of ailments, including chest pains, convulsions, hallucinations, hyperventilation, epileptic fits, and visions.Hetherington. In the end, most simply dropped down, overwhelmed with exhaustion. Midelfort, however, describes how some ended up in a state of ecstasy. Typically, the mania was contagious but it often struck small groups, such as families and individuals. = Tarantism = In Italy, a similar phenomenon was tarantism, in which the victims were said to have been poisoned by a tarantula or scorpion. Its earliest-known outbreak was in the 13th century, and the only antidote known was to dance to particular music to separate the venom from the blood. It occurred only in the summer months. As with dancing mania, people would suddenly begin to dance, sometimes affected by a perceived bite or sting and were joined by others, who believed the venom from their own old bites was reactivated by the heat or the music. Dancers would perform a tarantella, accompanied by music which would eventually \\"cure\\" the victim, at least temporarily. Some participated in further activities, such as tying themselves up with vines and whipping each other, pretending to sword fight, drinking large amounts of wine, and jumping into the sea. Some died if there was no music to accompany their dancing. Sufferers typically had symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, such as headaches, trembling, twitching and visions. As with dancing mania, participants apparently did not like the color black, and women were reported to be most affected. Unlike dancing mania, tarantism was confined to Italy and southern Europe. It was common until the 17th century, but ended suddenly, with only very small outbreaks in Italy until as late as 1959. A study of the phenomenon in 1959 by religious history professor Ernesto de Martino revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably unrelated to spider bites. Many participants admitted that they had not been bitten, but believed they were infected by someone who had been, or that they had simply touched a spider. The result was mass panic, with a \\"cure\\" that allowed people to behave in ways that were, normally, prohibited at the time. Despite their differences, tarantism and dancing mania are often considered synonymous. Reactions Music was typically played during outbreaks of dancing mania, as it was thought to remedy the problem. A painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, after drawings by his father As the real cause of dancing mania was unknown, many of the treatments for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some did seem effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised. People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by St. Vitus; they responded by praying and making pilgrimages to places dedicated to St. Vitus. Prayers were also made to St. John the Baptist, who some believed also caused the dancing. Others claimed to be possessed by demons, or Satan, therefore exorcisms were often performed on dancers. Bartholomew notes that music was often played while participants danced, as that was believed to be an effective remedy, and during some outbreaks musicians were even employed to play. Midelfort describes how the music encouraged others to join in, however, and thus effectively made things worse, as did the dancing places that were sometimes set up. Theories Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear whether it was a real illness or a social phenomenon. One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from ergot poisoning, which was known as St. Anthony's fire in the Middle Ages. During floods and damp periods, ergots were able to grow and affect rye and other crops. Ergotism can cause hallucinations and convulsions, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania. Other theories suggest that the symptoms were similar to encephalitis, epilepsy, and typhus, but as with ergotism, those conditions cannot account for all symptoms. Numerous sources discuss how dancing mania, and tarantism, may have simply been the result of stress and tension caused by natural disasters around the time, such as plagues and floods. Hetherington and Munro describe dancing mania as a result of \\"shared stress\\"; people may have danced to relieve themselves of the stress and poverty of the day, and in so doing, attempted to become ecstatic and see visions.Feldman. Another popular theory is that the outbreaks were all staged, and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity. Religious cults may have been acting out well- organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals. Despite being banned at the time, these rituals could be performed under the guise of uncontrollable dancing mania. Justus Hecker, a 19th-century medical writer, described it as a kind of festival, where a practice known as \\"the kindling of the Nodfyr\\" was carried out. This involved jumping through fire and smoke, in an attempt to ward off disease. Bartholomew notes how participants in this ritual would often continue to jump and leap long after the flames had gone. It is certain that many participants of dancing mania were psychologically disturbed, but it is also likely that some took part out of fear, or simply wished to copy everyone else. Sources agree that dancing mania was one of the earliest-recorded forms of mass hysteria, and describe it as a \\"psychic epidemic\\", with numerous explanations that might account for the behaviour of the dancers. It has been suggested that the outbreaks may have been due to cultural contagion triggered, in times of particular hardship, by deeply rooted popular beliefs in the region regarding angry spirits capable of inflicting a \\"dancing curse\\" to punish their victims.

At the top of the architrave blocks, a row of six guttae below the narrow projection of the taenia (fillet) formed an element called a regula. A regula was aligned under each triglyph of the Doric frieze. In addition, the underside of the projecting geison above the frieze had rectangular protrusions termed mutules that each had three rows of six guttae. These mutules were aligned above each triglyph and each metope.Summerson, 13‚Äì14, 126 It is thought that the guttae were a skeuomorphic representation of the pegs used in the construction of the wooden structures that preceded the familiar Greek architecture in stone. However, they have some functionality, as water drips over the edges, away from the edge of the building.Summerson, 13‚Äì14 Outside the Doric In the strict tradition of classical architecture, a set of guttae always go with a triglyph above (and vice versa), and the pair of features are only found in entablatures using the Doric order. In Renaissance and later architecture these strict conventions are sometimes abandoned, and guttae and triglyphs, alone or together, may be used somewhat randomly as ornaments.

It is also the name of their flagship product, the Geochron Global Time Indicator. The Geochron was the first world clock to display day and night on a world map, showing the familiar \\"bell curve\\" of light and darkness. The Geochron employs an intricate analog clockwork mechanism for its display, that shows the month, date, day of the week, hours and minutes, the areas of the world currently experiencing day and night, and the meridian passage of the sun. The main display is dominated by a world map, with time zones prominently indicated. At the top of the map are arrows corresponding to each time zone. As each day progresses, the map is scrolled from left to right by gear mechanisms, and the arrows for each time zone shift their positions relative to a stationary band fixed at the top that has a horizontal series of numbers representing hours. The viewer may read the time by seeing what number his time zone's arrow is currently pointing to. The map is backlit, and a mechanism behind the map defines well-lit and shaded areas that are also stationary relative to the movement of the map. In this way, as time progresses, different areas are shown to be experiencing daytime and night. The center of the lit area lines up with the 12 noon on the stationary time strip. There is also a day-and-month readout below the map, and a minutes readout above. Each Geochron is assembled upon demand, with prices starting at above $1,500. President Ronald Reagan presented a Geochron to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 as an \\"example of American ingenuity.\\" In the mid-1980s, the company was selling about 75 clocks per month, increasing to around 200 per month during the holiday season.

History The 9√ó25mm Danuvia submachine gun was designed by Hungarian engineer P√°l Kir√°ly in the late 1930s. The guns were issued to Hungarian army troops in 1939 and remained in service throughout World War II and until the early 1950s. A total of roughly 8,000 were made between 1939 and 1945. The Danuvia was a large, sturdy weapon, similar to a carbine. Although inspired by the 9√ó19mm Parabellum Beretta Model 38/42, the Danuvia used the more powerful 9√ó25mm Mauser round, and incorporated lever-delayed blowback in order to better manage this high energy cartridge. The Danuvia's magazine can be folded forward into a recess in the stock where a plate then slides over it. The gun was well-liked by troops it was issued to; it reportedly functioned well in the sub-zero, muddy conditions on the Eastern Front. The only difficulty was the availability of 9√ó25mm Mauser ammunition. It was used by the Hungarian army, military police and police forces and stayed in service until the early 1950s when it was gradually replaced by the PPSh-41 and the Kucher K1. Design The Danuvia featured a patented two-part lever-delayed blowback bolt. The fire selector switch is a circular cap on the rear of the receiver and is rotated to one of three settings: E (Egyes)(semiautomatic fire), S(Sorozat) (full automatic), or Z (Z√°rt)(the safety setting). The ejection port and cocking handle are on the right side of the receiver. It had a ramp-type rear sight above the ejection port and a post foresight at end of the barrel. Variants The earlier 39M variant The original Danuvia was the G√©ppisztoly 39M with a fixed wooden stock, which was followed in limited numbers by the G√©ppisztoly 39M/A with a folding wooden stock. In 1943 a new version with a forward folding metal stock, wood fore stock and a pistol grip was designated the G√©ppisztoly 43M. The 43M was the most produced version and had a shortened barrel and a forward-angled magazine.

In the literature, he is usually referred to as H. Kern or Hendrik Kern; a few other scholars bear the same surname. Life Hendrik Kern was born to Dutch parents in the Central- Javanese town of Purworejo in the Dutch East Indies, but when he was six his family repatriated to the Netherlands. When he entered grammar school, he added the extra-curricular subjects of English and Italian to his studies. In 1850 he went up to Utrecht University to study Letters, but in 1851 moved to Leiden University to avail himself of the opportunity to read Sanskrit with Professor A. Rutgers. After obtaining his Doctor's Degree in 1855, he moved to Berlin, where he continued his Sanskrit studies as a pupil of Albrecht Weber, and also took up Germanic and Slavonic languages. On his return to the Netherlands in 1858, Dr Kern accepted a post as a lecturer of Greek at Maastricht. In 1863 he was offered a Professorship in Benares, India where he taught Sanskrit at Brahmana and Queen's Colleges until 1865, when he was offered the Chair of Sanskrit at Leiden University. He remained there until his retirement in 1903, when he moved to the city of Utrecht. In 1866 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Professor Kern continued work after his retirement, but when in 1916 his wife died, he was heart-broken and out-lived her by less than a year. Work Bust Hendrik Kern by Charles van Wijk Together with Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk, Kern is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Oriental Studies in the Netherlands. His interest in languages was great, as witness his decision to take up English and Italian while still a secondary school pupil. In addition, he displayed an extraordinary ability to study, and to master, a wide variety of languages. At first, his studies were restricted (if \\"restricted\\" is indeed the correct word) to Indo-European languages, ranging from the Germanic sub- group to Sanskrit. His thesis, entitled Specimen historicum exhibens scriptores Graecos de rebus Persicis Achaemenidarum monumentis collatos (1855) broadened the field to Persian, showing that inscriptions in that language could now be used to extend our knowledge of Ancient Persia. While in Benares, he applied himself to the study of Dravidian languages as well as picking up some Arabic and Hebrew, but also learnt sufficient Hungarian to be able to read novels in that non-Indo-European language within a year. His studies also included the Malay languages. In 1874, he published an edition of the astronomer ƒÄryabhata's work, thus putting out the first publication in Nagara script in the Netherlands. Apart from promoting the study of Sanskrit, Professor Kern laid the foundation for Austronesian studies by Dutch scholars. It is as a comparativist and a philologist that he gained his great reputation. In 1879 he worked on Cambodian inscriptions, then turned his attention to Kawi (or Old Javanese) and in 1886 showed that Fijian and Polynesian were cognate languages. He was the first scholar to propose that the Oceanic languages constituted a sub-group of Austronesian (or Malayo- Polynesian, as the language family was then called), and in 1906 he published a study of Aneityum and Erromanga, two languages in the Vanuatu branch of the Oceanic sub-group. His interests were not restricted to pure linguistics. Thus, in 1889 he made use of the \\"W√∂rter und Sachen\\" method (which compares designations for plants, animals and objects in cognate languages) to ascertain a putative dispersal centre for the \\"Malayo-Polynesian\\" peoples. Kern's versatility also showed itself in his cultural studies. His History of Buddhism in India (1881‚Äì83), displays a thorough command of its subject. However, the author has been criticised for an incomplete understanding of Eastern astrology and mysticism, which may in part have been due to his positivist approach. Professor Kern has also been said to have borne a deep distrust of his contemporary Neogrammarians. He published extensively, and his influence on subsequent linguists, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere, has been profound. Select bibliography Kern's chief work is considered to be Geschiedenis van het Buddhisme in Indi√´ (Haarlem, 2 vols., 1881-1883). In English he wrote a translation of the Saddharma Pundarika (Oxford, 1884, published as Vol. 21 of Max M√ºller's Sacred Books of the East); and a Manual of Indian Buddhism (Strassburg, 1896) for Buhler Kielhorn's Grundriss der indoarischen Philologie. He also critically edited the Jataka-Mala of Arya Shura in the original Sanskrit [N√¢gar√Æ letters] which was published as volume 1 of the Harvard Oriental Series in 1891.

It was released only outside the US, but quickly became available as an import. Of the album's twelve songs, four were new compositions recorded specifically for it: \\"I'm a Legend Tonight,\\" \\"Down on Your Knees,\\" \\"Nowhere to Run\\" and \\"Partners in Crime.\\" These new songs were recorded at the behest of Phonogram Records, in response to the commercial failure of 1981's Music from \\"The Elder\\".Lendt, C.K. KISS and Sell: The Making of a Supergroup, Billboard Books, 1997. Album information By 1982, Kiss' commercial popularity was at its nadir. 1980's Unmasked had barely achieved gold certification in the United States, and the band toured exclusively outside the US for the first time in their career that year, aside from one show in New York which introduced Eric Carr as their new official drummer. Music from \\"The Elder\\" fared even worse, as it failed to gain any certification, and the band did not tour behind it at all.Gooch, Curt and Jeff Suhs. KISS Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History, Billboard Books, 2002. The album, released in November 1981, was off the charts by February 1982. Phonogram Records (the parent company of Kiss' label Casablanca Records) then requested that Kiss record four new songs, to be included on an upcoming greatest hits album. Phonogram requested hard rock songs specifically, in contrast to the progressive rock-style of Music from \\"The Elder\\". The album cover featured the streamlined look the band had adopted during the Elder period. Numerous outside songwriters and session musicians were employed for the writing and recording of the four new songs on Killers, as well as the subsequent album, Creatures of the Night. Songwriter and musician Mikel Japp, who co-wrote three songs on Paul Stanley's 1978 solo album, co-wrote \\"Down on Your Knees\\" with Stanley and Bryan Adams. Adam Mitchell, another outside songwriter, was brought in by producer Michael James Jackson.Gill, Julian. The KISS Album Focus, Volume 1 (3rd Edition). Xlibris Corporation, 2005. Despite being pictured on the album's cover art (from the photo session for Music from \\"The Elder\\"), lead guitarist and co-founder Ace Frehley did not participate at all in the production of Killers. He had essentially ended his active involvement with Kiss in late 1981, although he would not officially leave the group until the end of 1982, after the release of Creatures of the Night. His replacement for the Killers sessions was Bob Kulick, who had previously substituted for Frehley on a handful of studio tracks on 1977's Alive II; however, whereas Kulick had been asked to mimic Frehley's playing style when recording for Alive II, he was permitted to employ his own techniques for Killers. The four new songs were considered a \\"primer\\" for Kiss' next release, while some fans have indicated that fan club memos at the time listed Frehley as \\"temporarily out of action,\\" possibly due to a car accident or something similar, and originally listed Vinnie Vincent as a temporary replacement for Frehley. Due to the large volume of Kiss live albums and greatest hits albums already available domestically, Phonogram decided to issue the album outside the US. The album sold in moderate numbers, reaching its highest chart position of #6 in Norway. Killers peaked at #21 and #27 in Australia and Japan, respectively. In Sweden and the UK, it reached #41 and #42, respectively. None of the singles released from the album charted in any country. Also, due to the shape of the S in their band logo, there were two covers: one with the standard \\"S\\", and a more European friendly version with a \\"backwards\\"-Z shape. Track listing *The Japanese release featured two additional tracks not found on the standard edition: \\"Escape from the Island\\" (which is not on the Japanese release of Music From \\"The Elder\\") and \\"Shandi\\". Similarly, \\"Talk to Me\\" and \\"Shandi\\" were added to the track listing of the Australian release. *The version of \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" found on this release features the single mix that has all the vocals in the center channel, whereas the original Destroyer version features Paul Stanley on the right channel, and Gene Simmons on the left.

Application server technologies are tightly integrated to provide and offer management benefits such as integrated setup, enhanced monitoring, Remote Web Workplace, an unified management console, and remote access. Since the release of SBS 2003, the same service packs as those for Windows Server or other server products can be used to update the OS.  Editions  Initially, Small Business Server was marketed as an edition of Microsoft BackOffice Server. When Windows 2000 was released, it was marketed as Microsoft Small Business Server 2000, and finally was rebranded as a member of the Windows Server 2003 family. In December 2008, Microsoft also introduced a Windows Essential Business Server product aimed at medium-sized businesses, but this was discontinued in June 2010 due to low demand. Up to SBS 2003, the Premium edition also included Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server and Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003. The version of Windows Server that is part of Small Business Server 2008 and Essential Business Server 2008, known as Windows Server 2008 for Windows Essential Server Solutions (WinWESS) (also known as Windows Server 2008 Standard FE) is available outside the product suite, supporting a maximum of 15 Client Access Licenses. SBS 2008 Premium edition will not include ISA Server but will include a Windows Server 2008 license and SQL Server 2008 for running on a second server. Those upgrading to SBS 2008 Premium edition via Software Assurance will be compensated with a free license for the latest version of ISA Server. Windows Small Business Server 2011 was available in Essentials, Standard, and Premium editions. Essentials is a scaled down version for 1 to 25 users; both the other editions are based on the Windows Server codebase and include Microsoft Exchange Server mail server, Internet Information Services (IIS) web server, Windows SharePoint Services for collaboration, Microsoft Outlook 2003 email client (not included in 2008), Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), Windows Server Update Services for update management across the network, and a Fax server. Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials and Windows Server 2012 Essentials were earlier versions of corresponding releases of Windows Server. Windows Server 2016 Essentials, based on Windows Server 2016, is the previous version of Server Essentials, released in September 2016 with general availability October 12, 2016. Windows Server 2019 Essentials, based on Windows Server 2019, is the current version of Server Essentials, initially released in October 2018. Due to the discovery of significant issues, it was re-released with general availability on November 13, 2018.  Design and licensing considerations  All editions of Windows Server Essentials since the 2011 release do not need any client access license (CAL). Windows Small Business Server (not Essentials) had its own type of CAL, and included the user CALs for Windows Server, Exchange Server, and eventually SQL Server; the SBS CAL cost more than the Windows Server license, but less than the sum of separate access licenses for the two or three servers. Windows Small Business Server has the following design restrictions: * Only one computer in the domain can be running Windows Small Business Server. The domain supports multiple servers (including additional domain controllers) running any other operating system, such as Windows Server Standard Edition, but only one SBS. * Windows Small Business Server must be the root of the Active Directory forest. * Windows Small Business Server cannot trust any other domains. It cannot have any child domains. * Windows Small Business Server is limited to 75 users or devices depending on the type of CAL. * All Windows Small Business Server versions up to SBS 2003 are limited to no more than 4 GB of RAM. 2008 requires a minimum of 4GB for installation, it needs more for performance. 2008 supports a maximum of 32GB. * Windows Small Business Server versions prior to Windows Small Business Server 2008 are only available for the x86 (32-bit) architecture. * Windows Small Business Server 2008 is only available for the x86-64 (64-bit) architecture. This is due to the requirements of Exchange Server 2007, whose production version is 64-bit only. The 32-bit version of Exchange Server 2007 is only supported for testing and non-production use. * The SQL Server which comes with SBS 2008 is \\"SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition for Small Business.\\". It cannot be installed outside of a network that has a domain controller, and must have fewer than 75 PCs and/or users. * Only the Remote Desktop for Administration mode is available because Small Business Server always runs on the domain controller, and only two simultaneous RDP sessions are allowed. (Change from SBS 2000 policy) Terminal Services in application sharing mode needs to be run on a second server on the network. This however is possible with SBS 2011 Premium add-on which includes a Windows Server 2008 license for running the second server. * To remove these restrictions and upgrade to regular editions of Windows Server, Exchange Server, SQL Server and ISA Server, there is a Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 Transition Pack.  Unique features  *Remote Web Workplace *POP3 Connector (for Exchange Server) *Shared Modem Service (Modem server, not supported in Small Business Server 2003 and later)  Versions  * October 22, 1997 ‚Äì BackOffice Small Business Server 4.0 : Consists of Windows NT Server 4.0 SP3 and includes Exchange Server 5.0 SP1, Internet Information Services 3.0, SQL Server 6.5 SP3, Proxy Server 1.0, Internet Explorer 3.02 or 4.01, and Outlook 97; allows 25 client licenses. * May 24, 1999 ‚Äì BackOffice Small Business Server 4.5 : Consists of Windows NT Server 4.0 SP4 and includes Exchange Server 5.5 SP2, IIS 4.0, SQL Server 7.0, Proxy Server 2.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, Outlook 2000, and FrontPage 2000; allows 50 client licenses. * February 21, 2001 ‚Äì Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 : Consists of Windows 2000 Server (including Internet Explorer 5.0 and IIS 5.0) and includes Exchange 2000 Server, SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition, Internet Security & Acceleration Server 2000, Outlook 2000 and FrontPage 2000; allows 50 client licenses. * October 9, 2003 ‚Äì Windows Small Business Server 2003 (codenamed Bobcat) : Consists of Windows Server 2003 and includes Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2003, Windows SharePoint Services 2.0, and optionally Microsoft SQL Server 2000, ISA Server 2000 (upgrade to ISA Server 2004 in Small Business Server Premium SP1), and Microsoft FrontPage 2003 in Premium edition; allows 75 client licenses. Service Pack 1 for Windows Small Business Server 2003 was released on July 25, 2005. * July 29, 2006 ‚Äì Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 : Consists of Windows Server 2003 and includes Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2003, Windows SharePoint Services 2.0, and optionally Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Workgroup Edition, ISA Server 2004, and Microsoft FrontPage 2003 in Premium edition; allows 75 client licenses. A major addition is a built-in patch management tool optimized for small businesses, based on Microsoft Windows Server Update Services. Exchange database size limit is set to 18 GB by default but can be expanded to 75 GB using a registry key. * August 21, 2008 ‚Äì Windows Small Business Server 2008 (codenamed Cougar) : Consists of Windows Server 2008 and includes Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and 120-day trial subscriptions of new security products from Microsoft, namely, Forefront Security for Exchange and Windows Live OneCare for Server. The standard edition of SBS 2008 will be a single server product for small businesses. The premium edition will contain a license for Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition, with the option to run SQL Server on either the main SBS server, or a second server. The premium edition will therefore be targeted at dual-server scenarios such as terminal services application sharing, line of business applications, edge security, secondary domain controllers, and virtualization.SBS Server #1 is required to be 64-bit; SBS Server #2 will provide the option to run as either 32-bit or 64-bit. Microsoft unveils new Small Business Server In addition to features present in previous versions, new features include: :* A streamlined administration and management console that is designed around tasks to be accomplished rather than underlying technologieshttp://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windowsserver/essential/graphics/sbs/SBS_BusinessCapacity.jpg :* Built-in support for registering and configuring domain name and DNS records via multiple registrars :* Monitoring reports that gather data from both servers and clients on the network, including Security Center status (anti-virus, spyware, and client firewall) from all the clients :* New features in the Remote Web Workplace, such as the ability to define default and allowed PCs for each user :* Office Live Small Business integration for and configuring a public web site or extranet :* New server backup features, based on the incremental block-based backup technology in Windows Server 2008 (tape backup no longer supported via native tools, but continues to be supported via third parties) :* SBS 2008 requires installation behind a separate network firewall device. In contrast with SBS 2003, it does not support being installed directly on the edge of the network, ISA Server is no longer bundled and a dual-NIC configuration is not possible. :* Migration of 32-bit SBS 2003 versions to 64-bit SBS 2008 and SBS2011 has no in place upgrade and can be problematic.e.g. Migration Tool has increased default 7 day Active Directory coexistence period to 21 days to address this Inability to upgrade Sharepoint (WSS 2.0) by WSS 3.0 or SharePoint 2010 Foundation. :SBS 2008 was released to manufacturing on August 21, 2008 and was launched on November 12, 2008. Windows Small Business Server 2008 supports organizations with up to 75 users or devices. A notable change from SBS 2003 is that CALs are not enforced electronically. * December 13, 2010 ‚Äì Windows Small Business Server 2011 : Microsoft announced two successors to the SBS series during WPC 2010, both based on Windows Server 2008 R2. One successor (code name \\"Aurora\\") supports a maximum of 25 users, removes the traditional on-premises components of Exchange, SharePoint and WSUS, and is oriented to attach cloud services. The other successor (code name \\"SBS 7\\") is the more direct successor of SBS 2008, and continues to support a maximum of 75 users, and will continue to include the next generation on-premises versions of Exchange, SharePoint and Windows Server Update Services. : Late in 2010, Microsoft announced the official branding for the 2011 wave. SBS \\"7\\" will be branded as Windows Small Business Server 2011 Standard, and \\"Aurora\\" will introduce a new edition to the SBS product line: Windows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials. Additionally, changes to the premium edition were announced. Whereas formerly, the premium edition of SBS was packaged as a superset of the standard edition, in the 2011 wave it will be available as an add-on edition, containing standalone copies of SQL Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and available to add onto either SBS 2011 Essentials or Standard. : In mid- December, Microsoft released Windows Small Business Server 2011 Standard to TechNet/MSDN Subscribers for evaluation. Microsoft has also announced that Windows SBS 2011 Standard will be available to Volume Licensing in early January and as a trial in mid-January. SBS 2011 requires an Internet connection. * October 10, 2012 ‚Äì Windows Server 2012 Essentials : In July of 2012, it was announced that there would not be another Windows Small Business Server product after SBS 2011. SBS 2011 Essentials was succeeded by Windows Server 2012 Essentials.Windows Small Business Server Essentials becomes Windows Server 2012 Essentials One of the primary differences between Windows Server 2012 Essentials and previous versions of Small Business Server is that Windows Server 2012 Essentials does not include Microsoft Exchange which is used for messaging and collaboration, including the ability to host email. * September 9, 2013 ‚Äì Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials : Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials is an earlier version of Windows Server Essentials designed for small businesses with up to 25 users and 50 devices. Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials can also be used as the primary server in a multi-server environment for small businesses. * October 12, 2016 ‚Äì Windows Server 2016 Essentials : Windows Server 2016 Essentials is the previous version of Windows Server Essentials designed for small businesses with up to 25 users and 50 devices.

The book's central idea is to name and blame a long list of specific individuals whom Goldberg implicates in making the United States a \\"far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place.\\" In 2006, Goldberg updated his book, releasing 110 People Who Are Screwing Up America.  Description and synopsis  Goldberg's book denounces many people‚Äîmostly left-of-center celebrities, politicians and newscasters‚Äîand takes umbrage at high-profile incidents like Janet Jackson's exposing herself \\"in front of one-fifth of all the kids in America under age eleven\\" during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (p. vi). It decries as \\"Hollywood blowhards\\" actors who call American politicians \\"Nazis\\" while praising \\"dictators like Fidel Castro\\" (pp. vii‚Äìix). Goldberg's chapter for Courtney Love is simply the word \\"ho\\". Other people (on the cover) include: filmmaker Michael Moore (#1), Democratic leader Howard Dean, reverend Al Sharpton, and rapper Eminem. The book takes aim at \\"liberals [who are] snooty, snobby know-it-alls, who have gotten angrier and angrier in recent years and who think they're not only smarter, but also better, than everyone else, especially everyone else who lives in a 'red state'‚Äîa population they see as hopelessly dumb and pathetically religious\\" (p. x). While the book mainly criticises liberals, there are a few moderate and even conservative individuals mentioned, notably Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh. The subtitle, \\"and Al Franken is #37\\", is likely a response to Al Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, which contains a chapter entitled, \\"I Bitch-Slap Bernie Goldberg\\", focused on debunking Goldberg's previous book Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News.  Reception  = Favorable = Jonah Goldberg (no relation), editor of National Review, said the following of the book: \\"Goldberg is no down-the-line conservative, and you are certain to disagree with some of his choices and rankings -- and probably also with his often salty language. Nevertheless, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is a rollicking and revealing look at 100 of the most egregious obstacles on the path of our nation's return to glory.\\" A review by Brent Bozell, President of the conservative Media Research Center, also offered praise for the book:Bernie Goldberg gets even From a Brent Bozell column at Townhall.com \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is out, and it's a wonderful read for anyone not on that list.\\" \\"It's easy to presume that this is the conservatives' answer to recent published tirades against the Right by leftists like Franken and Michael Moore, but there are important distinctions,\\" wrote Bozell. \\"First, Goldberg doesn't limit the list to those on the Left. Jimmy Swaggart makes the list, as does Michael Savage. Many in the religious Right will quarrel with his selection of Judge Roy Moore. All should applaud his choice of David Duke.\\" = Unfavorable = In a review in The New York Times, Richard Brookhiser wrote, \\"Such books are part of the puppet theater of modern political discourse\\" and that \\"any clever and combative person could write 80 percent of this book, or its mirror image, in a weekend.\\" Brookhiser also questioned the legitimacy of the book's arguments, given that the successes of many in the list are made possible by the public. He rhetorically asked: \\"Shouldn't Goldberg's book be 270 Million People Who Are Screwing Up America?\\"  Conservative vs. liberal selections  Cathy Young, whom Goldberg praised in the book for her criticism of radical feminism, has argued that the conservatives on Goldberg's list are either \\"safe\\" targets who are not powerful or influential in conservative circles, or \\"tokens\\" inserted to create the appearance that Goldberg is not being partisan. She suggests that discredited televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, for instance, is a \\"safe\\" alternative to Pat Robertson, who is still a fixture on the Christian right. Responding to Goldberg's assertions that he is not taking political sides, Young questions why his criticisms of \\"haters\\" who \\"demonize\\" their opponents extends to multiple individuals on the left, but only a single conservative, talk radio host Michael Savage. Young suggests that Ann Coulter would belong on the list, but Goldberg only mentions her by way of making a favorable comparison to Savage. Young also suggests that Goldberg employs a double standard in defending Coulter because she offers invective \\"with a twinkle in her eye\\" while simultaneously dismissing the notion that some of Al Franken's statements should be taken less seriously because he is engaging in satire.Young, Cathy; \\"The book on one-sidedness\\"; The Boston Globe; August 15, 2005  Factual inaccuracies regarding rap music  Goldberg received criticism of his inclusion of rappers in the book. The book attributes the creation of gangsta rap to the record label Interscope Records; gangsta rap had been around commercially for at least six years prior to any involvement from the record label. Artists such as Ice-T and N.W.A both had platinum- selling success as gangsta rap artists before the founding of Interscope. The book claims that Interscope Records was entirely funded by Ted Field, when it was actually to a large extent‚Äîas much as 50%‚Äîfunded by Atlantic Records.  Jon Stewart criticism  On July 13, 2005, Goldberg appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to promote the book. Jon Stewart criticized the list for suggesting that liberals who do not hold positions of power, such as Barbra Streisand, were responsible for problems in America, while conservatives who held powerful positions in the Bush Administration or Republican Congress were not held responsible for anything. Goldberg agreed that the list included more liberals than conservatives but responded that his book dealt with cultural issues. Stewart also argued that the book focused on a \\"culture war\\" he sees as largely \\"fabricated,\\" and that declining rates of homicide and teen drug use suggest that, in fact, American culture is not as troubled as Goldberg suggests. Stewart argued that people who \\"say a bad word on television\\" don't affect people's lives, while government officials do. \\"I wish smart guys like you spent less time worrying about Barbra Streisand and more time worrying about Richard Perle or Karl Rove, or whoever the Democrats had in those positions during the Clinton years,\\" Stewart said. Goldberg argued in response that the culture is important and that he intended the book to raise the public discourse because many of the people on his list had turned public debate into bickering and name-calling.  Responses  Some of those included on the list have responded to the book humorously. Cartoonists Jeff Danziger and Ted Rall both said it was \\"an honor\\" to be included on the list, with the latter adding, \\"Not only am I grouped with many people whom I admire for their achievements and patriotism, I'm being demonized by McCarthyite thugs I despise.\\"Attacking liberals is high on his list From an Alex Beam piece in the Boston Globe Entrepreneur Todd Goldman quipped that he \\"hope[s] to be ranked higher next year.\\" Goldberg's book prompted a response from Jack Huberman, who wrote 101 People Who Are Really Screwing America (and Bernard Goldberg is Only #73). Matt Kunitz (executive producer of Fear Factor and No. 69 in Goldberg's book) told the Los Angeles Times, \\"I look at my company; I think Michael Moore was No 1. I don't mind being in that group of people.\\" Ten new entries were added in Goldberg's 2006 update, 110 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Among these are the white nationalist band Prussian Blue, anti-homosexual preacher Fred Phelps, spam mailer Jeremy Jaynes, former United States Attorney General and lawyer-activist Ramsey Clark, and several Supreme Court Justices. Barbara Kingsolver responded to her inclusion on the list in her book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle. She joked about the inclusion and said that she was proud to be on the list with people such as Jimmy Carter. The book was referenced in the manifesto of Jim David Adkisson, the gunman who killed two people and wounded seven others in the Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting.Dahlia Lithwick, \\"The Cruelest Month: Another lethal April, another failure to ask why\\", Slate, April 15, 2009Jim Balloch, Jamie Satterfield, \\"Pastor: Remorseless shooter is victim of his own hate: Adkisson receives life without parole in slayings of 2\\", Knoxville News Sentinel, February 9, 2009  References   External links  * Sample and audio excerpt (Official publisher web page) * Interview with the author Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States Category:Books by Bernard Goldberg Category:Cultural depictions of American people ","title":"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America"},{"id":"2187914","title":"117th IOC Session"},{"id":"2187924","text":"The 1987 Pacific hurricane season was the last year in which the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center was the primary warning center for tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started May 15, 1987, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1987, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1987. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when the vast majority of tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Despite there being 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms directly affected land. Hurricane Eugene was the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.

In 1987, there were 20 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and four major hurricanes, all were well above average, save the number of major hurricanes which was only slightly above normal. The former made 1987 the fifth most active season on record at that time. Today, 1987 is tied with the 1994 Pacific hurricane season and the 2009 Pacific hurricane season as the sixth most active on record. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, one storm peaked at hurricane strength (Peke) and one peaked as a tropical storm (Oka). Two tropical storms entered this area of responsibility from the east by crossing 140¬∞W. The season lasted a total 171 days beginning with the formation of Adrian and early June and the dissipation of Tropical Depression Twenty on November 25. There was a total of 924 storms hours and 631 hurricane hours. By comparison, the long-term averages at that time were 161 season days, 875 tropical storm hours, and 664 hurricane hours. 397 advisories were issued, which was below the 1977‚Äì1987 average of 428. The Hurricane Hunters did not fly into any of the storms in 1987. This was also the first year where tropical storm watches and warnings were issued instead of gale watches and warnings for tropical cyclones. 1987 was the last season that the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City was responsible for forecasting in this basin, a task it had performed since circa 1972. The EPHC was folded into the National Hurricane Center, which took responsibility for the basin starting in the spring of 1988. Only one tropical storm developed in June. In July, six named storms formed. Out of these storms, Hilary was the only storm to reach major hurricane status. The month of August had a total of five named storms, four of which became hurricanes. However, August did not feature any major hurricanes, though Hurricane Jova came close, peaking as a moderate Category 2. The month of September held the same number of named storms as August, with five named storms. The month also was the carrier of the strongest hurricane on record at that time (that had its intensity estimated from satellite imagery), Hurricane Max, a strong Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Norma was a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, which dissipated to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. The month of October featured only two tropical cyclones. The first system, Ramon, was a Category 4 hurricane. Very few cyclones this season impacted land. The only landfalling hurricane of the year, Hurricane Eugene was responsible for significantly damaging about 15 sq. mi of fruit crop, where damage estimated were at $2.6 million (1987 USD) In all, damage totaled to about $142 million. Tropical Storm Irwin, paralleled the coast of Mexico, causing flooding near Acapulco. Damage was totaled at $2.1 million (1987 USD). The remnants of Norma and Pilar produced rain over Baja California Sur. The remnants of Ramon brought extremely heavy rains to the Western United States. A moderate El Ni√±o was present throughout the season, with water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific was above normal. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period;. modern estimates place the PDO for 1987 at above normal. Systems =Tropical Storm Adrian= On June 7, a tropical depression formed southeast of Acapulco. It strengthened into a tropical storm immediately thereafter. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) on June 8, Adrian slowly weakened. It fell to tropical depression status on June 9 and dissipated later that day. During its life, Adrian paralleled the Mexican shoreline far offshore before looping counter-clockwise over its path when it was a depression. =Tropical Storm Beatriz= On July 3, a tropical depression formed south of Cabo San Lucas. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Beatriz slowly strengthened and moved generally northwest as it stayed far offshore. On July 5, Beatriz reached its peak wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h). It weakened thereafter, falling to a depression on July 6 and dissipating the next day. =Tropical Storm Calvin= A tropical depression formed south of Mexico on July 5 and immediately strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. Calvin headed generally east. On July 8, as a strong tropical storm. It then gradually weakened, falling to a depression on July 9 and dissipated the next day while located southwest of Cabo San Lucas. =Tropical Storm Dora= A tropical depression that had organized on July 15 while located south of Cabo San Lucas. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm that same day while located around 215 mi (345 km) west of Acapulco. Dora headed west-northwest and slowly strengthened. It reached its peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 17. It then steadily weakened, becoming a depression two days later. Dora dissipated on July 20 while located west of Cabo San Lucas. =Hurricane Eugene= A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on July 22 near the coast of Mexico. It initially headed westward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day it formed. It strengthened into a hurricane, the first of the season, on July 24 as an upper-level cyclone pulled the system north. After peaking as a low-end Category 2 hurricane on July 25, land interaction weakened the hurricane to Category 1 as it made landfall west of Manzanillo. The rough topography weakened Eugene, and the hurricane was only a depression when it emerged into the Gulf of California. It promptly dissipated on July 26. When the storm first posed a threat to Mexico on July 24, the port of Zinuhuatenjo was closed for small craft. Operation classes were suspended in Acapulco. In Manzanillo, the port was officially closed down. The Mexican navy was put on alert for a total distance of . The weather service issued navigation warnings for three coastal states and ships were urged to maintain contact with officials. Hurricane Eugene caused extremely heavy rain in coastal parts of Mexico. The highest rain was 20.68 inches at Aquila, Michoac√°n. The system was responsible for the highest tropical cyclone caused rainfall in five Mexican states. Over 5,000 people were displaced. In Manzanillo alone, at least 60 people were rendered homeless. Most of the damage was the scattering of debris and mud. Six people were injured, and a man in Venustiano Carrazano was killed when a palm tree was blown over. In all, three fatalities were reported. The hurricane destroyed about 15 sq. mi (39 km2) of fruit crop in the country, amounting to more than $2.6 million in damage (1987 USD). Additionally, damage to eight beach houses totaled to $120,000. Total crop damage reached $142 million (1987 USD); In the aftermath of the storm, the navy and army and local government devised a cleanup plan. They worked quickly to restore water and power service, and within a few days the services had been restored for most of the impacted area. =Tropical Storm Fernanda= At a location more westerly than typical for eastern Pacific hurricanes, Tropical Depression Nine-E formed on July 24. Heading west, the cyclone reached tropical storm intensity on July 25. Fernanda strengthened and reached its peak strength near hurricane status on July 26, the same day it crossed 140¬∞W and entered the central north Pacific. Fernanda headed in the general direction of the Hawaiian Islands as a trough approached. The trough caused wind shear, which weakened the cyclone into a tropical depression on July 28. Fernanda dissipated three days later. =Hurricane Greg= A tropical wave left the coast of Panama on July 26. It organized into Tropical Depression Ten on July 28 while located and it strengthened into a tropical storm the day after the system formed. Over water, the cyclone steadily intensified as it roughly paralleled the Mexican coast while remaining far offshore. Greg became a hurricane on 1800 UTC July 31 and peaked with wind speeds of 80 mph (130 kmh) on August 1. It then weakened as it moved over cooler water, falling to tropical storm intensity later on August 1. At this time, Greg was located away from Baja California. It then weakened into depression intensity on August 2, and completely dissipated the next day. Greg affected Mexico a few weeks after Eugene did, resulting in additional flooding. Due to both storms, the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average. =Hurricane Hilary= A tropical wave moved through Central America on July 30 and July 31\\\\. Steered by a large deep-layer ridge that extended as far southwest as Hawaii and as far northeast as Oklahoma, the wave moved steadily west-northwest. Thunderstorm activity increased considerably after 0000 UTC on July 31\\\\. A tropical depression formed at 1800 UTC on July 31 while located south of Cabo San Lucas. The cyclone strengthened at a steady pace and reached hurricane intensity on August 1\\\\. Hilary continued strengthening, and became a hurricane on August 2\\\\. On August 3, the cyclone reached Category 3 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the first major hurricane of the season. At its peak strength, which it reached on August 4, Hilary had winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). It then weakened, and had fallen to Category 1 intensity on August 5. The hurricane then restrengthened, maintaining Category 2 intensity until August 6\\\\. The system then began a terminal weakening trend. By August 7 it was only a tropical storm. After falling to depression strength, Hilary dissipated on August 9 over waters. In Southern California, officials hoped that Hilary would produce a major increase in waves in time for a surfing tournament finals, though only a small increase in wave action was expected. =Tropical Storm Irwin= A tropical depression formed on August 3 over south of Manzanillo. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Irwin fluctuated in strength as it closely paralleled the coast of Mexico. On August 6, Irwin reached its maximum winds of 65 mph (100 km/h); it maintained that velocity for over two days. During August 8, Irwin turned nearly due west and headed out to sea. Irwin weakened to a tropical depression on August 9 and immediately dissipated. Forecasters at one point in time noted the possibility of the storm impacting California. In addition, the storm produced heavy rainfall in Mexico, causing $2.1 million in damage. Although many businesses and homes received damage, no deaths were reported. =Hurricane Jova= A tropical depression formed on August 13, while located south-southeast from Baja California Sur. The cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Jova the next day. The depression initially moved to the west-southwest due to a ridge north of the system. It slowly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity on 1800 UTC August 16. The intensifying hurricane then turned west-northwest. When it peaked on August 17, Jova was a moderate Category 2 hurricane. After peaking, Jova slowly weakened as it turned westbound. It was in a moderately declining state when it crossed 140¬∞W and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Jova continued to weaken, and was a depression by August 20. Jova dissipated two days later while due south of the Big Island of Hawaii over water, although it remnants were still visible south of Johnston Atoll until at least August 24. Jova generated heavy surf for a few days in Southern California. =Tropical Storm Oka= A disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone organized into Tropical Depression One-C on August 26. Twelve hours later, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Oka, which is Hawaiian for Oscar. Oka slowly moved west-northwest and reached its peak wind speed of 60 mph (95 kmh) on August 27. The next day, a nearby trough caused wind shear, which weakened Oka to a depression on August 29 and subsequently destroyed it. =Tropical Storm Knut= On August 28, a tropical depression formed west Manzanillo, Mexico. Twelve hours later, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Knut. Never attaining winds stronger than 40 mph (65 kmh), Knut stayed a tropical storm for one day. It weakened to a tropical depression on August 30 and dissipated later that day. The cyclone stayed out at sea for its entire life, and never threatened land. Knut had no impact on land. However, its name was retired in 1992 for unknown reasons and was replaced by Kenneth. =Hurricane Lidia= Lidia originated from a disturbance that entered the basin on August 28. It remained south of the Mexican coast in an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and at 1800 UTC August 29, Tropical Depression Fifteen formed. It intensified into a tropical storm six hours after development about away from Baja California Sur. Lidia moved northwest, paralleling the Mexican coast. It edged in a more westerly direction for a day before resuming its northwesterly path, and reached hurricane intensity on 0600 UTC September 1. At its strongest on September 1 based on intensity estimates via Dvorak classifications, Hurricane Lidia had a wind speed of 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Lidia began weakening and lost hurricane intensity on September 2. Lidia weakened very rapidly over cold water. Early the next day, Lidia weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over waters on 1200 UTC September 3. The remnants of the storm; however, brought showers to California. One woman was injured by a lightning strike. =Hurricane Max= A tropical disturbance left Central America on September 8. At 1200 UTC on September 9, a tropical depression formed over the warm waters south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. While located from Cabo San Lucas, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Max. Heading west-northwest, Max rapidly intensified and became a hurricane on September 11, over a day after it was named. Turning northwest, Max continued to intensify. By September 10, the cyclone reached Category 2 intensity, and became a major hurricane several hours later. On September 12, Hurricane Max reached Category 4 intensity. The cyclone reached its maximum windspeed of 155 mph (250 km/h) on September 13. Meanwhile, a then-record was set for the highest satellite estimates for a Pacific hurricane. At that time, Dvorak classifications, which measure a tropical cyclones intensity, were at \\"7.0\\", which was then the highest ever recorded in the basin, though this was later matched by hurricanes Hernan and Trudy of the 1990 Pacific hurricane season. Max maintained its intensity for then unprecedented 24 hours. However, the storm crossed the isotherm and began to weaken rapidly. The hurricane's track then shifted north for a time, before turning to the west on September 15. That same day, the weakened to a tropical storm. The tropical cyclone dissipated at 1200 UTC September 16 while located north-northeast of Cabo San Lucas. The hurricane was predicted to send waves to Southern California, though Max was well past its peak at that time. =Hurricane Norma= A tropical disturbance developed on September 13 while located southwest of Acapulco. Moving northwest, a depression formed on September 14 far from land. It took over 24 hours to reach tropical storm strength. Norma paralleled the coast far offshore. The storm steadily intensified over sea surface temperatures. On September 17, Norma turned to the north, and became a minimal hurricane for 12 hours as an eye became visible on infrared imagery. Norma turned northbound toward land. However, Norma remained offshore due weak southwesterly flow from a cutoff low located west of Baja California Sur. The cyclone stalled and then edged slightly east when it weakened back into a depression on September 19. Tropical Depression Norma dissipated a mere south of the Baja California Peninsula; it never made landfall. Prior to the remains of Hurricane Norma's arrival in the Southwestern United States, forecasters were anticipating cloudy skies over San Diego. Over the deserts and mountains near the area, there was also a possibility of heavy rainfall. The remnants ultimately caused rainfall and thunderstorms in California on September 22 and September 23. The rainfall totaled to at Lindbergh Field, and at Lemon Grove. There were numerous power outages, small fires, some road flooding, and some property damage. In San Diego and southern Orange County, 200,000 homes and business lost power, but the power was quickly restored. However, there are no reports of damage or flooding in Baja California from the storm; the area the tropical cyclone struck was sparsely populated. =Hurricane Otis= Otis originated from the a tropical disturbance in the monsoon trough. It moved over the warm waters south of the Mexican Riviera from September 17 to September 19. At 0000 UTC September 20, the disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E while moving to the northwest. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day while located southwest of La Paz. Eighteen hours later on September 21, Otis became a hurricane. It also began to turn back to the west and began to undergo a period of rapid deepening. The hurricane would then reach Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The next day, Otis reached its peak windspeed of 115 mph (185 km/h). It would oscillate irregularly between that strength and Category 2 intensity until September 24. That day, it began accelerating to the west as it lost strength due to increased wind shear and water. Otis fell to tropical storm strength on September 25 and a depression on September 26, and dissipated shortly after that. =Hurricane Peke= An area of disturbed weather southwest of Hawaii gathered enough convection and a closed circulation to become Tropical Depression Two-C on September 21. It immediately strengthened into a storm and was named Peke. Peke continued to strengthen as it tracked north just east of the International dateline. Peke intensified into a hurricane on September 23 and reached Category 2 intensity the next day. Peke continued heading north and shortly after weakening into a Category 1 hurricane, it turned to the northwest and crossed the dateline. It re-intensified, and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) typhoon on September 23. It accelerated to the northwest and began to take in drier air, which caused weakening. On October 2, Peke re-curved to the southeast. The last advisory on this tropical cyclone was issued on October 3 as it dissipated. Peke's remnants continued drifting erratically for over three days, first heading east, then northwest, and then southeast, at which time they were finally unidentifiable. Hurricane/Typhoon Peke caused no damages or deaths. However, was also the first tropical cyclone of hurricane strength to cross the dateline since 1967's Hurricane Sarah to cross the dateline at that strength. In addition, Peke was the third tropical cyclone in three years to exist on both sides of the dateline, after 1985's Typhoon Skip and 1986's Typhoon Georgette. =Tropical Storm Pilar= A tropical depression formed on September 30 while located south of the Baja California Peninsula. It headed north and peaked as a minimal tropical storm on October 1. After being a tropical storm for a mere six hours, Pilar weakened to a depression and dissipated that same day. It never made landfall, dissipating just south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It was a tropical cyclone for a total of 24 hours. The system caused no known damage on land, but Pilar dropped heavy precipitation on Baja California Sur from 1200 UTC on September 30 until 0000 UTC October 2. An observer station reported of rainfall. This was the most rainfall the weather station had ever recorded since its founding in 1969. =Hurricane Ramon= On October 3‚Äì4 an area of disturbed weather moved into the Pacific Ocean south of a high pressure area over Central Mexico. The storm became better organized over waters. By October 5, a tropical storm had developed southwest of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. It moved generally to the west-northwest. Ramon intensified into a hurricane on October 7 and reached major hurricane status on October 8. At its most intense on October 9 and October 10, Hurricane Ramon had winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest due to interaction with subtropical jetstream winds and rapidly weakened over cooler sea surface temperatures. It became a tropical storm on October 11 and a depression on October 12. It dissipated shortly thereafter. Torrential rains deluged Southern California, resulting in street flooding. Two people perished in separate traffic accidents. In Los Angeles, three more people perished in separate traffic incidents. Heavy rains extended west and was also reported in Hemet in Riverside County, where three people were also injured during a car accident. The rains helped dissolve a week-long forest fire 16,000 acre (65,000,000 m2) on Mt. Palomar. The Spring Creek River overflowed its banks. The tropical moisture also helped end a 37-day dry spell at Salt Lake City, marking the longest time the city went without rain since 1964. Nationwide, Ramon killed five people, all due to road-related incidents. =Tropical Storm Selma= On October 27, a tropical depression formed and headed northwest, gradually re-curving north. It intensified into a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm on October 28. Selma maintained that strength until the next day, when it weakened to a depression. Selma's re-curving continued, and on October 29, it again intensified into a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm. Without further strengthening, it weakened into a tropical depression, headed north northeast, and dissipated on October 31 about east of the southern tip of Baja California. =Tropical depressions= On June 10, a weak tropical depression, the second of the season, developed. It moved very little and did not affect land. It dissipated on 1200 UTC June 12. The season's next tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression Three formed six days after the previous one dissipated. Moving west-northwest, it peaked at 35 mph (55 km/h). On June 20, it dissipated. Tropical Depression Six developed on July 13 about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The depression had same peak intensity as Three and had dissipated on July 17. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on July 18 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and two days later it exited CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database. As it entered into western Pacific, it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name Wynne. The final tropical cyclone developed at 1800 UTC November 24 around southwest of Baja California Sur. A very weak cyclone, the depression dissipated on November 25, ending the above-average season. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1987. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 1993 season. This is the same list used for the 1981 season. However, the names Xina, York, and Zelda were added to name lists for odd-numbered years sometime after 1985 due to that year's season threatening to exhaust the list. Storms were named Pilar and Ramon for the first time in 1987, as the name Selma had been used on the older lists. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Adrian * Beatriz * Calvin * Dora * Eugene * Fernanda * Greg * Hilary  * Irwin * Jova * Knut * Lidia * Max * Norma * Otis * Pilar  * Ramon * Selma   } Two names from the Central Pacific list were used ‚Äì Oka and Peke.

The hurricane season officially started May 15, 1986, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1986 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1986 in both regions. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. A total of 17 named storms and 9 hurricanes developed during the season; this is slightly above the averages of 15 named storms and 8 hurricanes, respectively. In addition, 26 tropical depressions formed in the eastern Pacific during 1986, which, at the time, was the second most ever recorded; only the 1982 Pacific hurricane season saw a higher total. Several storms throughout the season affected land. Hurricane Estelle passed south of Hawaii, resulting in $2 million in damage and two deaths. Hurricanes Newton, Paine and Roslyn each struck Northwestern Mexico. While damage was minimal from these three systems near their location of landfall, Paine brought considerable flooding to the Great Plains. The overall flooding event resulted in $350 million in damage, with the worst effects being recorded in Oklahoma. Hurricane Roslyn was the strongest storm of the season, attaining peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). Seasonal summary Activity in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center's (EPHC) area of responsibility was above average. There were 25 tropical depressions, one short of the record set in 1982, which had 26. Only one storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility, Tropical Depression One-C. Six other cyclones entered the CPHC area of responsibility from the EPHC area of responsibility. In all, 17 systems formed, which is two storms above normal. In addition, 9 hurricanes were reported during the season, one more than average. An average number (3) of major hurricanes ‚Äì Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale ‚Äì was also reported. The season began with the formation of Hurricane Agatha on May 22 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Twenty Five on October 25, spanning 147 days. Although it was nearly two weeks shorter than the 1985 Pacific hurricane season, the season was six days longer than average. The EPHC issued 406 tropical cyclone advisories, which were issued four times a day at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. In 1986, Hurricane Hunters flew into three storms; Newton, Roslyn, and Estelle. In Newton, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted environmental research in the cyclone. In addition, the National Weather Service Field Service Station provided the East Pacific with excellent satellite coverage. During the months of May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one tropical storm and two hurricanes formed. The following month, five tropical systems developed. Towards the end of the season, tropical cyclone activity declined somewhat. While five storms formed in September, only one formed in October and none during the month of November. A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific were 1.3 ¬∞C (3 ¬∞F) above normal. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period. Three tropical cyclones made landfall in 1986. The first, Hurricane Newton made landfall near Cabo San Lucas, bringing minor damage. Another storm, Hurricane Paine brushed Cabo San Lucas, and later moved inland over Sonora. Paine caused minimal impacts at landfall, but its remnants were described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history. Flooding affected 52 counties in Oklahoma, which resulted in a total of $350 million in damage. The final storm to make landfall during the hurricane season was Hurricane Roslyn. The hurricane produced some flooding, but no serious damage. In addition, Hurricane Estelle came close enough to Hawaii to require a hurricane watch. Two drownings were reported, and the total damage was around $2 million.

By 0000 UTC May 22, the circulation began to tighten and become more organized, and thus the EPHC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Depression One-E that morning. Approximately 48 hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Agatha, the first storm of the season. After moving southeast, the cyclone made an abrupt change in direction, turning towards the north. Agatha strengthened into a hurricane on May 25 near the coast of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity of 75 mph (115 km/h). Turning southeast, the system quickly weakened into a tropical depression, but regained tropical storm strength on May 28, only to dissipate that day. Rainfall spread around both the Atlantic and Pacific Mexican coasts, peaking at at Xicotepec de Juarez, Puebla. =Tropical Depression Two-E= A tropical disturbance formed on May 30 in the eastern Gulf of Tehuantepec. The disturbance was moving very slowly when it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Two-E on May 31\\\\. The depression began to weaken six hours later and the final advisory by the EPHC was released on June 1. Most of Mexico received rainfall, with over falling on Yucat√°n Peninsula. The worst rain occurred in Central Mexico, where over of precipitation fell, peaking at in Tenosique, Tabasco. The rest of the country was hit by of rainfall. =Tropical Storm Blas= A tropical disturbance originated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 16\\\\. The disturbance moved west-northwest at below a weak upper-level high, becoming the third tropical depression of the 1986 season on June 17\\\\. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Blas the next day. It kept that strength for only six hours, weakening into a depression again as it moved into cooler waters. After Blas's convection dissipated, the EPHC ceased advisories on June 19 while situated roughly south of Cabo San Lucas. =Hurricane Celia= On June 24, five days after Tropical Storm Blas dissipated, a tropical disturbance developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, its circulation had become well-defined enough for the EPHC to upgrade the disturbance into Tropical Depression Four. Winds reached 40 mph (65 km/h), enough to upgrade the system into Tropical Storm Celia on June 26\\\\. While located off the coast of Mexico, Celia strengthened into a hurricane at 1800 UTC June 27\\\\. An eye became evident on satellite imagery and the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) on June 28 at 1600 UTC. Hurricane Celia then passed by Socorro Island. Meanwhile, Celia moved into much cooler water which enabled the hurricane to weaken rapidly. By June 30, Celia had become a tropical depression. The EPHC released its final advisory at 1800 UTC that day as the system was dissipating. =Tropical Storm Darby= The fifth tropical cyclone of the season formed as a tropical disturbance on July 2\\\\. Moving northwest at about , the disturbance entered warmer waters and strengthening rapidly. The disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Five at 1800 UTC July 3. Turning west-northwest, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Darby on July 5\\\\. Darby peaked at 40 mph (60 km/h). The stormed continued northwest for about six hours, when it reached waters and began a weakening trend. Clouds spread northward over the US states of Arizona and California on July 6\\\\. The cyclone dissipated on July 7. =Hurricane Estelle= During the afternoon of July 16, a tropical depression formed thousands of miles west of Mexico, and within 12 hours it strengthened into a tropical storm. On July 18, Estelle intensified into a hurricane. Located in a favorable environment, Estelle continued strengthening to become the first major hurricane of the season on July 20. The hurricane entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility near its peak strength of 135 mph (215 km/h), a Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane veered to the west and passed south of Hawaii. Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23, and on July 25, it weakened to a depression. The storm dissipated two days later. In advance of Hurricane Estelle, the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch and high-surf advisory for the Island of Hawaii. More than 200 people evacuated from their homes. Huge waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22\\\\. The high waves washed away five beachfront homes and severely damaged dozens of others on the beach resort of Vacation Land. The total damage was around $2 million (1986 US$; $ USD). However, only two deaths reported from the storm, both of whom drowned offshore Oahu. =Hurricane Frank= The EPHC began monitoring a tropical disturbance located southwest of San Salvador on 1800 UTC July 23\\\\. About 24 hours later, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. Initially moving towards the west-northwest due to an upper-level low and a ridge over Mexico, the storm then turned to the west as the upper-level low changed direction. By July 28, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Frank. After turning back to the west-northwest, Frank reached hurricane intensity early on July 30\\\\. The storm quickly developed a well-defined eye and three hours later, Hurricane Frank reached its peak intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, with winds of . Hurricane Frank maintained this intensity for 18 hours. Subsequently, the hurricane began to rapidly weaken over sea surface temperatures. Wind shear soon increased, thus accelerating the weakening process. On July 31, Frank was reduced to tropical storm intensity. Not long after weakening into a depression, the storm entered the CPHC's area of responsibility. Wind shear increased further, and upon entering the region, Frank moved over slightly cooler water. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 3. =Tropical Storm Georgette= On August 3, a tropical depression developed in the open ocean over west of the Mexican coastline. Twelve hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Georgette before weakening to a depression on August 4\\\\. It then accelerated to a very rapid speed of 23‚Äì45 mph (37‚Äì75 km/h). Due to its fast speed, Georgette could not maintain a closed circulation, and thus degenerated into a non-cyclonic disturbance on August 4\\\\. The disturbance kept up its rapid forward motion, crossed the dateline and entered the western Pacific, where it reformed and reached its peak intensity as Severe Tropical Storm Georgette. By August 16, Georgette merged with another system. =Tropical Storm Howard= A tropical wave crossed Southwestern Mexico and Belize in mid-August. A tropical disturbance developed from this wave south of Acapulco on August 15, the same day that the system moved offshore. Moving west-northwest south of an upper- level high, the system was classified as a tropical depression the next day about south of Manzanillo. Several hours later, the depression reached tropical storm intensity. Turning towards the northwest due to a trough, it failed to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength. Passing south of the Baja California Peninsula, the storm rapidly moved over cooler waters. Howard weakened into a tropical depression at 0600 UTC August 18\\\\. Transversing water, Howard dissipated. Rainfall along the southern coast reached in some places, with totals in excess of in isolated locations. Further north, rainfall was more scattered. The maximum rainfall was in Reforma, near the southern part of the country. =Tropical Storm Isis= A tropical disturbance developed south of Socorro Island at 1800 UTC August 18\\\\. Twenty-four hours later the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on August 19. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Isis the next day. After peaking as a moderate tropical storm at 1200 UTC August 23, Isis weakened into a depression over waters early on August 24\\\\. While located some west of the Mexican coast, the tropical cyclone dissipated later that day. =Hurricane Javier= On August 19, a tropical disturbance formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec and south of Cabo San Lucas. Satellite imagery began to show signs of developing a circulation, and the disturbance became a tropical depression on August 20 and intensified into Tropical Storm Javier hours later. Southwest of a ridge, Javier began to turn towards the west-northwest. Despite an increase in forward speed, Tropical Storm Javier underwent rapid intensification, reaching hurricane intensity at 0900 UTC August 21. About three hours later, Javier reached Category 2 strength, and briefly became a major hurricane on August 22, only to rapidly weaken back to a Category 1 hurricane late on August 23\\\\. Hurricane Javier sharply turned towards the north and eventually towards the northwest. Early on August 24, Javier resumed intensification, regaining Category 3 intensity at 0600 UTC. Passing midway between Socorro Island and Clarion Island, the storm reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h). Moving beneath the ridge, Hurricane Javier turned to the west and subsequently weakened back into a Category 3 hurricane. After briefly re-intensifying into a Category 4, the storm resumed weakening due to increasing wind shear, and by late on August 25, Hurricane Javier had weakened directly into a Category 2 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Javier was downgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. While it managed to maintain marginal hurricane intensity for 24 hours. on 1200 UTC August 28, the EPHC announced that Javier had weakened back into a tropical storm. Shortly after that, Javier turned towards the west-northwest due an upper-level trough. Now over waters, the system continued to weaken as wind shear increased further. On August 30, Javier weakened into a depression and dissipated the next day over southwest of Southern California. Waves were 15 ft (4.6 m) high in some areas, prompting meteorologists to issue a high surf advisory. Hurricane Javier brought the highest waves of the summer to southern California. =Tropical Storm Kay= In late August, a tropical disturbance formed east-southeast of Hurricane Javier and nearly south of the Baja California Peninsula. Moving slowly west, the disturbance began to develop a well-defined circulation, and was respectively upgraded into a tropical depression on August 28\\\\. Passing 10 mi (20 km) south of Clarion Island, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kay. The cyclone's forward speed increased; subsequently, Kay reached its peak intensity. After maintaining its intensity for 18 hours, Kay rapidly weakened over cold water, and was downgraded into a depression at 0000 UTC September 2\\\\. Kay dissipated the next day several hundred miles west of the Baja California Peninsula. =Tropical Storm Lester= A westward-moving tropical wave increased in thunderstorm activity, soon organizing into a tropical depression on September 13. At the time of the upgrade, Lester was located more than west of the Mexican coast. Moving towards the west, the depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Lester. After turning towards the west-northwest, Lester peaked in intensity as a moderate tropical storm. Due to a combination of strong wind shear and cold water, Lester began a slow weakening trend. While entering the CPHC's area of responsibility at 1800 UTC September 17, Lester had already weakened to a tropical depression. Unable to maintain a closed circulation, the final advisory was issued. =Tropical Storm Madeline= A tropical disturbance first developed during September 13 and September 14 over the warm waters south of Acapulco. On September 15, the EPHC first classified the system as a tropical depression. Rapidly moving towards the west, the depression was embedded in deep easterly flow. The system attained tropical storm intensity on 1800 UTC September 16, thus received the name Madeline. After turning towards the west-northwest, Tropical Storm Madeline accelerated. It began a slow intensification trend, and peaked as a high-end tropical storm on 0600 UTC September 18\\\\. An upper-level low introduced strong wind shear, and Madeline began to fall apart almost immediately thereafter. After turning towards the north, and slowing down, Madeline dissipated on September 22. =Hurricane Newton= A tropical disturbance became a tropical depression on September 18\\\\. Intensification was slow as the depression did not reach storm status until September 20\\\\. Paralleling the coast, Newton steadily intensified. Newton strengthened into a hurricane on September 21\\\\. On September 22, Newton slammed into Cabo San Lucas, and after entering the Gulf of California, Hurricane Newton attained its peak intensity 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly after that, Newton moved inland into the mainland of Mexico. Over land, Newton dissipated on September 23. Upon making landfall on the Baja California Peninsula, moderate rainfall was recorded. After the hurricane's second landfall, damage was also minor, though 40 roofs were ripped off of homes; trees and utility poles were also downed due to high winds. However, no injuries or fatalities were reported in association with Newton. Newton's remnants later combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall that downed power lines in Kansas City, leaving 20,000 customers without power. =Hurricane Orlene= Hurricane Orlene originated from a stationary tropical disturbance that was upgraded into a tropical depression on September 21. Despite a poorly defined circulation, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Orlene 12 hours after formation. Steadily gaining strength, Orlene reached hurricane intensity on September 22\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane entered the CPHC's area of responsibility. Upon the formation of an eye, Orlene reached its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h). After maintaining peak intensity for 24 hours, Hurricane Orlene began to encounter strong wind shear. Subsequently, Orlene weakened rapidly and lost hurricane status at 1800 UTC September 23\\\\. The system weakened into a tropical depression on September 24\\\\. Tropical Depression Orlene dissipated the next day. =Hurricane Paine= A tropical disturbance developed on September 27 within of the Mexican coastline. The disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Twenty-Three on 0000 UTC September 28\\\\. Tropical Depression Twenty-Three moved west- northwestward, lured poleward by an upper-level trough near northern Mexico. At 0000 UTC September 30, the depression became Tropical Storm Paine, southwest of Acapulco. Roughly 21 hours later, a NOAA Hurricane Hunter flight found winds of 90 mph (145 km/h), upgrading Paine into hurricane. The hurricane peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on October 1 as it turned northwest, headed towards the Gulf of California. Hurricane Paine did not intensify further due to the presence of mid-level wind shear and dry air. The outer eyewall moved across Cabo San Lucas, and the resultant land interaction was believed to have slightly weakened the inner core of the hurricane. Paine moved ashore near San Jos√©, Sonora with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The storm weakened as it moved over land going through Mexico and then entering the United States. Paine dissipated on October 4 over Lake Michigan. Rainfall from the tropical cyclone was significant in Mexico and the United States. Light rain fell in Cabo San Lucas. Meanwhile, rains around the Mexican Mainland peaked at 12 in (300 mm) in Acapulco. Near the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services. In the United States, rainfall peaked at in Fort Scott, Kansas. The Barnsdall, Oklahoma weather station recorded 10.42 inches (26.5 cm) on September 29, which set a record for the highest daily precipitation for any station statewide. The flooding affected 52 counties in Oklahoma, which resulted in a total of $350 million in damage. In all, Paine was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history. Flooding from Paine resulted in about 1,200 people homeless in East Saint Louis, Illinois and resulted in record discharge rates along many streams and creeks. Subsequently, many reservoirs were nearly filled to its capacity. For example, the Mississippi River in St. Louis reached the fifth highest flood stage on record. =Hurricane Roslyn= A tropical disturbance moved westward offshore Nicaragua and was declared Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 15.. During the early afternoon of the next day, ship reports indicated the formation of a tropical depression close to land. The cyclone moved at a quick pace towards the west-northwest south of a warm-core ridge. Early on the morning on October 16, Roslyn became a tropical storm. By the morning of the October 17, Roslyn had developed into a hurricane south of Acapulco. A vigorous upper trough was deepening offshore Baja California, and Roslyn began to re-curve within a few hundred miles of Manzanillo. The system struck Mazatl√°n as a marginal hurricane on October 20. The low-level center rapidly dissipated, although a frontal low developed in the western Gulf of Mexico, which moved over southeastern Texas and later through the Mississippi Valley. The original upper-level circulation maintained its northeast movement, bringing rainfall to the Southeastern United States. Affecting a sparsely- populated area, the highest reported winds from a land station were . Roslyn produced some flooding, but no serious damage. Impact was limited to flooded homes and factories, as well as some crop damage and beach erosion and only one yacht sunk. The remnants of Hurricane Roslyn produced heavy rainfall across the central and southern United States. In Matagorda, Texas, a total of was reported. =Other systems= In addition to the 17 named storms, there were eight tropical depressions during the season that failed to reach tropical storm strength. The second, Tropical Depression Seven, began as a large area of thunderstorms near Hurricane Estelle on July 17\\\\. Moving at a steady pace, the cyclone failed to intensify and attained peak intensity of 30 mph (50 km/h). Cool sea surface temperatures and its proximity to Hurricane Estelle eventually caused the depression to dissipate late on July 18. Tropical Depression Eight formed on July 21 while located southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. Initially moving west-northwest around an upper- level high, the depression peaked with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It dissipated on July 24. Another tropical disturbance formed on July 24\\\\. A circulation developed two days later, and thus it was classified as Tropical Depression Ten. The cyclone remained a tropical depression for about three days before moving into the CPHC's area of responsibility on 1000 UTC July 27\\\\. A slow weakening trend began as the depression continued to move west at speeds of 30 mph (45 km/h). By 1800 UTC on July 29, it had become poorly organized around west-southwest of the Hawaiian Islands, and the final advisory was issued. Tropical Depression One-C formed on July 27, possibly from the remnants of Tropical Depression Eight that dissipated a few days earlier well to the east of 140 ¬∞W. The depression tracked westward at a fairly rapid forward speed of 35 mph (55 km/h); however, it failed to develop past the depression stage. One-C passed well south of the Hawaiian Islands on July 28\\\\. On July 29 at 0000 UTC, it had dissipated to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands and the final advisory was issued by the CPHC. An area of disturbed weather developed a circulation on August 12 and was upgraded into Tropical Depression Twelve nearly south of the Baja California Peninsula. It drifted slowly to the northwest until it dissipated near 22 ¬∞N 110 ¬∞W on August 14\\\\. Peak maximum sustained winds were estimated at 35 mph (55 km/h). Tropical Depression Seventeen formed on September 8, east of Socorro Island and dissipated on September 9 over cold water without becoming a tropical storm. One of the last cyclones of the season formed from a westward-moving tropical disturbance in the ITCZ. The disturbance moved at about and upon developing a circulation, was declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One at 0600 UTC September 19\\\\. However the depression lasted for only six hours before dissipating, likely due to the close distance between it and Tropical Storm Madeline. Tropical Depression Twenty-Five was the final tropical depression of the 1986 season. It formed on October 22 at 1800 UTC near the 140¬∞W line. Due to strong wind shear, the stationary storm had dissipated within 30 hours of formation. Even though no more official systems developed, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked that an unnamed tropical storm may have formed in November. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1986. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1992 season. This is the same list used for the 1980 season. A storm was named Paine for the first time in 1986, while Orlene and Roslyn were previously used on the old four-year lists. No central Pacific names were used; the first name used would have been Oka. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Agatha * Blas * Celia * Darby * Estelle * Frank * Georgette  * Howard * Isis * Javier * Kay * Lester * Madeline * Newton  * Orlene * Paine * Roslyn  * } See also * List of Pacific hurricanes * Pacific hurricane season * 1986 Atlantic hurricane season * 1986 Pacific typhoon season * 1986 North Indian Ocean cyclone season * Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons: 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87 * South Pacific cyclone seasons: 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87 Notes References External links * Unisys Weather archive for the Eastern Pacific, 1986 * Central Pacific Hurricane Center archive Category:Pacific hurricane seasons 1986 ATL ","title":"1986 Pacific hurricane season"},{"id":"2187956","text":"The T.

T. Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum History Wentworth opened his first museum as a roadside stand in the suburb of Ensley in 1957, and continued to collect items of interest. His curiosity spanned a wide range of materials. In the 1980s, Wentworth said he would donate his entire collection to the city if it provided a permanent location in Pensacola. A state grant was signed by Governor Bob Martinez to enable the city to renovate the former city hall for this purpose, as the city had completed a new facility in 1985. The museum was officially opened in 1988. One floor is dedicated to Wentworth's eccentric collections, which include a mummified cat, among other items. The other two floors illustrate and interpret life in the Florida Panhandle over the centuries; some of the artifacts are from Wentworth's collection. The other floors house a science interactive museum for children. From September 2004 to March 2005, the museum was closed for renovations after Hurricane Ivan caused considerable damage to the property. When the museum opened again, a new exhibit was added, comparing and contrasting the effects of the 2004 hurricane to the 1926 hurricane that had damaged the building. On July 14, 2020 the University of West Florida Historic Trust announced that it was looking into changing the museum's name in light of newly released documents showing that Wentworth was a leader of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2020/07/13/t-t-wentworth-kkk-leader-1920-s-uwf- historic-trust-looks-change-museum-name/5429495002/ References External links *Historic Pensacola Village's Official Website Category:Pensacola metropolitan area Category:Historic Pensacola Village Category:Museums in Pensacola, Florida Category:History museums in Florida Category:Science museums in Florida Category:1988 establishments in Florida Category:Museums established in 1988 Category:Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Florida ","title":"T.

When his playing days ended, he became a broadcaster; Francoeur is currently the lead television analyst for Atlanta Braves games. A mid-season call-up for the Braves in 2005, he played in slightly fewer than half of his team's games that year and finished the season with impressive enough statistics to finish third in Rookie of the Year voting and a Sports Illustrated cover story declaring him \\"The Natural\\". While he never again had similarly strong statistics, he continued to have a productive career, playing for 11 more seasons as a journeyman outfielder for seven more teams before retiring after a short stint with the Marlins in 2016. Throughout his career, Francoeur was noted for his strong throwing arm in the outfield and his free-swinging tendencies in the batter's box. He won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award in . Minor league career Francoeur was selected by the Braves in the first round of the June 2002 MLB draft. A 4-star Defensive Back committed to Clemson, he chose to forego college to play baseball. After the draft, Francoeur was assigned to the team's advanced Rookie League club in Danville, Virginia, where he played 38 games and hit .327 with 8 home runs and 31 RBIs. Francoeur advanced steadily through the Braves minor league system, playing for Rome (Low A) in 2003, Myrtle Beach (High A) and Greenville (former AA) in 2004, and Mississippi (AA) in 2005. Francoeur was a member of the Rome Braves inaugural season team which went on to win the 2003 South Atlantic League Championship. He led that team in home runs with 14. In 2004, Francoeur was named the top prospect in the Braves organization by Baseball America. He was a member of the Carolina League regular season and postseason All-Star team. In 2005, he was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game before getting called up by Atlanta. In March 2014, after he was released by the Cleveland Indians, Francoeur signed with the San Diego Padres and was sent to the El Paso Chihuahuas in Triple A. Francoeur's new teammates played an elaborate month-long prank on him by convincing him that pitcher Jorge Reyes was deaf. Reyes cooperated with the prank, maintaining the appearance of being deaf by not speaking or listening to music. Chihuahuas first baseman/outfielder Cody Decker made a short film about the prank. Sportswriter Peter Gammons called Decker \\"My new favorite person.\\" Major league career Atlanta Braves in 2008 =Atlanta Braves= Francoeur was promoted by Atlanta on July 6, 2005. He was part of a group of rookie players, nicknamed the \\"Baby Braves\\", that Atlanta called up from its minor league system during the 2005 season. Francoeur made his MLB debut the following day when he started in right field against the Chicago Cubs in the second game of a double header. In the bottom of the eighth inning he hit a 3-run homer to center field, his first Major League hit. Francoeur is famous for his promise at the very beginning of his career: he made the cover of the edition of August 26, 2005 of Sports Illustrated, who dubbed him \\"The Natural\\" after he hit .360 with a 1.067 OPS in his first 37 games. Francoeur finished the season batting .300/.336/.549 in 67 games, with 14 home runs, and 44 RBIs. During his rookie season he garnered a reputation as a free swinging fastball hitter, with his first walk not coming until his 128th plate appearance. On defense, Francoeur became known for having a strong and accurate arm, finishing the season with 13 outfield assists (third overall in MLB) despite playing less than half the season. He finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting while garnering the most second place votes. Francoeur hit .260 with 29 homers and 103 RBIs in his first full season in the majors. He also became just the fourth Brave to play in all 162 games of a season, joining F√©lix Mill√°n, Dale Murphy, and Andruw Jones. Francoeur was ejected for the first time in his career on July 16, 2006. On May 13, 2006, Francoeur hit a walk-off grand slam against the Washington Nationals, the first walk-off home run and grand slam of his career. In his second full season in 2007, Francoeur batted .293, with 19 homers, and 105 RBIs. Francoeur also displayed talent on the defensive side of the field, leading the league in outfield assists with 19 while earning his first career Gold Glove. Francoeur played in all 162 games for the second consecutive season. He was ejected for the second time in his career on July 16, 2007, exactly one year to the day of his first ejection. On April 12, 2008, Francoeur went 3 for 5 against the Washington Nationals including two home runs and a career high seven RBIs. He compiled a streak of 370 consecutive games played before sitting out the second game of a doubleheader, on May 20, 2008. On May 22, 2008, Francoeur went 3 for 4 against the New York Mets with an RBI triple, an RBI single, and a two-run home run, finishing a double short of a cycle. After weeks of being mired in the worst slump of his career, Braves management optioned Francoeur to Double-A Mississippi on July 4, 2008, to work with his old hitting coach Phillip Wellman and refine his swing away from the pressurized major league setting. Francoeur had posted a line of .234/.287/.374 to that point of the season. Francoeur was recalled on July 7, 2008, after only three days in the minors because of the rash of injuries suffered by the Braves, over the holiday weekend. His slump continued after his return to the majors; Francoeur posted a .234/.300/.324 line through September 10. =New York Mets= On July 10, 2009, Francoeur was traded to the New York Mets for outfielder Ryan Church. Francoeur made his Mets debut on July 11, 2009, and notched two RBIs in his first at bat. He finished the day going 2‚Äì4 with two RBIs, a strikeout, and was caught stealing once. On July 20, Francoeur hit his first home run as a Met off Washington Nationals pitcher Logan Kensing, during the ninth inning of that game. On August 23, 2009, Francoeur became the second player in major league history (after Homer Summa in 1927) to hit into a game-ending unassisted triple play. He hit a line drive directly to Eric Bruntlett, second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies. Francoeur re-signed with the Mets for 2010. After being the Mets' starting right fielder for the first half of the 2010 season, Francoeur was replaced by √Ångel Pag√°n to make room for the return of Carlos Beltr√°n in the second half. =Texas Rangers= On August 31, 2010, Francoeur was traded by the Mets to the Texas Rangers for infielder Joaqu√≠n √Årias. Francoeur was utilized primarily for defensive purposes on the 2010 AL Champions. =Kansas City Royals= Kansas City Royals in 2011 On December 8, 2010, Francoeur signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Royals worth $2.5 million which included a mutual option for the 2012 season. On August 18, 2011, Francoeur agreed to a two-year extension with the Royals worth $13.5 million. He was designated for assignment on June 30, 2013 after hitting .208/.249/.322 in 59 games with the Royals. =San Francisco Giants= Francoeur was signed to a minor league contract by the Giants, on July 9, 2013. On July 13, his contract was purchased from the Fresno Grizzlies. Francoeur was designated for assignment on August 20, and released on August 22. In 22 games for the Giants, he recorded 12 hits, 4 RBIs, batting only .194. =Cleveland Indians= Francoeur signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on January 6, 2014. The organization released Francoeur on March 22, 2014. =San Diego Padres= Francoeur signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres, on March 26, 2014. He was assigned to the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas and hit the first home run in team history on April 3, 2014. They considered converting him into a pitcher, and he spent part of his time in the minors pitching. However, they decided to keep him as an outfielder in the end. He was called up and was in the starting lineup on July 23. On August 11, Francoeur was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was outrighted back to the Chihuahuas. Francoeur elected free agency in October 2014. =Philadelphia Phillies= On November 13, 2014, Francoeur signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 16, 2015, Francoeur was used as a relief pitcher in a 19‚Äì3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, throwing the only scoreless inning of the game. However, he surrendered two runs in the next inning. In July, he began to have success both off the bench and in the starting lineup, including a stretch during which he hit three home runs in eight games. Although he expressed a desire to remain with the Phillies through the 2015 season and perhaps even beyond, his play indicated he might be moved near the trading deadline to bolster a contending team's outfield. However, he was not moved at the trade deadline. Ultimately, he finished the season with a .258 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs. =Return to Atlanta= On February 22, 2016, Francoeur agreed to a minor-league deal with the Braves, with an invitation to spring training. On March 29, the Braves purchased Francoeur's contract. =Miami Marlins= Francoeur was traded to the Miami Marlins on August 24, 2016, in a three-team deal that included the Texas Rangers. The Braves got minor league utility player Dylan Moore from the Rangers and minor league catcher Matt Foley from the Marlins. Broadcasting On May 12, 2017, it was announced that Francoeur would become a color analyst for select Atlanta Braves baseball games broadcast on Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast. On November 29, 2018, the Braves announced that Jeff Francoeur would replace Joe Simpson as their lead television analyst. In September 2019, it was announced that he had been hired by TBS to work as an analyst for the network's NL Wild Card Game, NLDS (Washington vs. Los Angeles alongside Ernie Johnson Jr.) and National League Championship Series (NLCS) alongside Brian Anderson and Ron Darling. He repeated this role in 2020 for American League playoff games, as TBS had the AL contract that year. International career Along with former Braves teammate Chipper Jones, Francoeur played on the USA team in the first ever World Baseball Classic, in March 2006. In six at bats, he hit a double, and scored one run. Personal life Francoeur comes from a family of teachers. His parents, David and Karen, are both retired teachers. Francoeur's father, who is of French- Canadian heritage, is from Springfield, Massachusetts; his mother is from Green Bay, Wisconsin. His sister Heather (Francoeur) Karvis used to teach English and co-coached the girls' basketball team at St. Pius X Catholic High School in Atlanta with Josh Geffner.

The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshtein's term, a \\"metabola\\" (rather than hyperbole), that means \\"transfer\\" or \\"transition,\\" opening many dimensions.See part 3 in \\"Metabola\\" is different from the symbol or a \\"visual\\" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities.See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism & Contemporary Russian Culture. University of Massachusetts Press, 1995, 416 p. , , pp. 40‚Äì50. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world. Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism. What is metarealism? Metarealism is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts. For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities. For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its figurative and transcendent meanings. Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a holistic view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is \\"the geometrical space constituted by points of view. Metarealism in visual art According to Bernard De Montr√©al, most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the euphoric, sub mental symbolism of the art form an avocation of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self. Conscious or mental art \\"metarealism\\" when created by a metaconscious artist is inspired by the higher self and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artifact of relative value. The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative \\"expiration\\" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

Jacques Cossette-Trudel was the son of a senior Federal Government official with the Department of Energy during Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's administration. While a student at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al he became active in left wing politics with the Groupe Marxiste Revolutionnaire, a Quebec-based part of The Waffle, a radical wing of Canada's New Democratic Party. In May 1968, he was deeply involved in Montreal in the organization of the student movement for the democratization of the education system. Soon after, Cossette-Trudel's views became more extreme and he joined the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) whose members were responsible for a decade of radical manifestos, bombings and armed robberies in the Province of Quebec. While still a student, he met and married another radical leftist, Louise Lanct√¥t. During what became known as the October Crisis, as the leader of the FLQ's Liberation Cell, on October 5, 1970, Jacques Cossette-Trudel along with his wife Louise, her brother Jacques Lanct√¥t, Yves Langlois, Nigel Hamer, and Marc Carbonneau abducted James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner, from his Montreal home, demanding the release of 27 convicted FLQ militants and the publication of the group's political manifesto. The federal government, at the invitation of the Quebec provincial government, responded with the adoption of the War Measures Act. Under this law, 500 citizens were jailed and 10,000 Canadian soldiers were deployed on the streets of Montreal. Believing many of their fellow citizens would join an uprising, the goal of the FLQ was to create an independent socialist state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba and the Algerian revolution. Early in December 1970, police discovered the location of Cossette-Trudel's Liberation Cell hideout. The safe release of their hostage, Cross, was negotiated and on December 3, 1970, after Cossette- Trudel, his wife, and the other known members of his cell were granted safe passage to Cuba, with approval from Fidel Castro,Jay Walz, The New York Times, December 5, 1970, linkBangor Daily News, Dec. 4, 1970 link Cross was released. Jacques Cossette-Trudel and his wife remained in Cuba for four years. They worked as volunteers for the Cuban press agency Prensa Latina. Their son, Alexis Cossette-Trudel was born in 1972. In 1974, they moved to France as political asylum seekers. Though asylum was refused, they were permitted to remain in France.The Montreal Gazette - Nov 13, 1975 linkOttawa Citizen - Jun 25, 1974 link Their second child, Marie-Ange Cossette-Trudel, was born in France in 1974. On October 13, 1977, Quebec Premier Ren√© L√©vesque announced he was seeking a pardon for Jacques Cossette-Trudel and his wife. The federal government consented to their return. On December 13, 1978, they pleaded guilty at trial in Montreal and were sentenced to five years' probation and two years in a provincial jail for their part in the kidnapping and attempted extortion. They were freed on parole after serving eight months. Since divorced from his wife, Jacques Cossette-Trudel has made a living as a communication counsellor in provincial health and social institutions. Since 2000, he has been a successful screenwriter and filmmaker and has received financial assistance from T√©l√©film Canada and the Sodec for his work. According to a 2000 interview he gave to Radio-Canada television, Jacques Cossette-Trudel has always stayed very connected politically and still believes in an independent, multicultural and socialist state of Quebec.

Closing out the series' 11th season, the two-hour episode first aired on CBS on February 28, 1983, ending the series' original run. The episode was written by eight collaborators, including series star Alan Alda, who also directed. The episode's plot chronicles the final days of the Korean War at the 4077th MASH; it features several storylines intended to show the war's effects on the individual personnel of the unit and to bring closure to the series. After the ceasefire goes into effect, the members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. After tear-filled goodbyes, the main characters go their separate ways, leading to the final scene of the series. Plot As final peace negotiations continue during the Korean War, Hawkeye Pierce undergoes treatment at a psychiatric hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown in the OR. Prompted by Sidney Freedman, he gradually recalls an incident that occurred while the personnel of the 4077th were returning to camp from a beach outing. Their bus picked up some refugees and wounded soldiers, but was forced to pull off the road to avoid being spotted by an enemy patrol. Hawkeye recounts that he told a woman to keep her \\"chicken\\" quiet, which she did by smothering it, leading to its death. Meanwhile, a runaway tank destroys the camp latrine and crashes nearby. Leaving the camp to relieve himself in a creek, Charles Winchester is surprised to find five Chinese soldiers ready to surrender to him. He takes them back to camp and, after discovering that they are musicians, calls for some Mozart. One of them plays a theme from Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, and Winchester begins to teach them the entire piece. When he is turned down for a staff position at a prestigious Boston hospital, Margaret Houlihan secretly uses her father's connections to get it for him. Winchester becomes angry with Margaret after learning from Klinger that he only won the position through her intervention. Klinger has fallen in love with Soon-Lee Han, a local Korean refugee, and persuades her not to look for her missing parents in an area of heavy fighting. B.J. Hunnicutt receives his discharge orders and promises Colonel Potter that he can arrange for a surgeon to take his place. During a sudden mortar attack prompted by the presence of the crashed tank, Father Mulcahy rushes to free several POWs from a makeshift holding pen, and is affected by an exploding shell. He demands that B.J. ‚Äì the only one who knows about Mulcahy's deafness caused by the explosion ‚Äì keep it a secret so that he will not be discharged and lose his opportunity to care for the local orphans. Upon further treatment, Hawkeye eventually reveals that the chicken was his own mental substitution of the event in order to cope with it, as the woman had actually smothered her baby. He resents Sidney for making him remember the baby's death, but Sidney explains it is a necessary part of the recovery process. He sends Hawkeye back to the 4077th and promises to check in on him. B.J. leaves to begin his journey home after being discharged, when Colonel Potter receives a notice rescinding B.J.'s discharge but decides not to act on it. Hawkeye returns to camp and learns to his dismay that B.J. did not leave him a goodbye note. As the shelling continues, he impulsively jumps into the tank and drives it into the camp garbage dump, diverting the enemy fire away from the OR. Potter becomes concerned and calls Freedman for a follow-up visit with Hawkeye. The camp is forced to relocate due to an incendiary bomb attack and resulting forest fire. Once the unit has set up, the replacement surgeon arrives ‚Äì B.J., who had made it as far as Guam before word of the rescinded discharge reached him. During a party to celebrate the second birthday of B.J.'s daughter, Hawkeye thinks Sidney is there to confront him about the tank incident, but Sidney reassures him that his actions were sensible in caring for his fellow soldiers. Hawkeye then confides to Sidney that the incident on the bus has made him scared to be near children. Sidney brushes off these fears, telling Hawkeye that his failures may make him a better doctor. Hawkeye later hesitates briefly before operating on a young girl, but is able to go ahead with the procedure; Sidney leaves the 4077th with Hawkeye's thanks. Charles reluctantly says goodbye to the Chinese musicians during a prisoner exchange, and they play the Mozart Clarinet Quintet for him while being driven away in a truck. A final ceasefire is announced, to take effect at 10:00 that night and mark the end of hostilities in the war. The camp moves back to its original site on orders from headquarters, with wounded soldiers continuing to arrive. While performing triage, Winchester is horrified to discover that one of the musicians has been brought in dead and that the others were killed when their truck was attacked. Dazed, he returns to The Swamp and tries to listen to the record of the Clarinet Quintet he taught them, but smashes it in anger. Once the surgical shift is finished, the camp personnel throw a final party and talk about their plans for after the war. Klinger surprises everyone by announcing that he wants to marry Soon-Lee and stay in Korea to help her find her parents. The next morning, Mulcahy officiates at their wedding before the camp is dismantled and everyone says their goodbyes, leaving via assorted modes of transportation. Winchester apologizes to Houlihan for his earlier poor treatment of her, and gives her a book of her favourite poetry. Just before Hawkeye leaves in a chopper, B.J. shouts that he left a note this time. As he lifts off, Hawkeye looks down and sees it: the word GOODBYE spelled out with rocks across the landing pad. He smiles to himself as the chopper carries him away from the 4077th. Cultural reaction and impact The anticipation before the airing of \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" was unprecedented, especially for a regular television series (in contrast to awards shows, sporting events, or special events). Interest from advertisers prompted CBS, the network broadcasting M*A*S*H, to sell 30-second commercial blocks for $450,000 (equal to $ today) each‚Äîcostlier than even for NBC's airing of the Super Bowl of that year. On the night the episode aired, large areas of California (particularly the San Francisco Bay Area) suffered power outages due to unusually stormy winter weather, which prevented many viewers from watching the series finale. Three weeks later, on March 21, KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, re-aired the episode. =Reaction and AfterMASH= In the United States, the episode drew 105.97 million total viewers and a total audience of 121.6 million, more than both Super Bowl XVII and the Roots miniseries. The episode surpassed the single-episode ratings record that had been set by the Dallas episode that resolved the \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" cliffhanger. From 1983 until 2010, \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" remained the most watched television broadcast in American history, passed only in total viewership (but not in ratings or share) in February 2010 by Super Bowl XLIV. It still stands as the most-watched finale of any television series, as well as the most- watched episode. As M*A*S*H was one of the most successful shows in TV history, in order not to lose the franchise completely, CBS quickly created a new series, AfterMASH, that followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside hospital. Despite wide popularity in its premiere episodes, script problems and constant character changes led to a sharp decline in viewers, and the show was canceled by CBS after only two seasons. Another would-be spin-off, W*A*L*T*E*R, was a pilot made in 1984 that was never picked up. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his M*A*S*H character. \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" was not initially included in the syndication package for M*A*S*Hs final season; however, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere in time for its 10th anniversary. Local stations aired it as a part of a Movie of the Week. \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" was not the final show filmed, as the final season was filmed out of order. The final scene filmed for the series was the time capsule burial scene from \\"As Time Goes By\\". The wildfire story line was written into the show after a real wildfire destroyed most of the outdoor set, in October 1982. The scene was filmed less than 12 hours after the fire had ravaged the set. When M*A*S*H was shown on FX and Hallmark Channel, they aired \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" occasionally. Hallmark Channel showed it twice a year, February and August, before dropping M*A*S*H from its schedule. TV Land and MeTV have also shown the episode sporadically, including Veterans Day broadcasts on November 11, 2015 and November 11, 2019. In Canada, the cable channel History Television shows the episode in its entirety annually on the Labor Day holiday. In 2011, the TV Guide Network special TV's Most Unforgettable Finales ranked this finale as the best. Because the final episode was filmed as a 2 1/2-hour movie, the producers counted it as 5 episodes in the season's production order to the network for broadcasting, for a total of 20 episodes in all.

Although derived from the successful P-38 Lightning, the XP-58 was plagued by technical problems with its engines that eventually led to the project's cancellation. Design and development The XP-58 was a Lockheed Aircraft Company funded initiative to develop an improved Lightning as a long-range fighter following the release by the U.S. Army Air Corps of the Lightning for sale to Britain on 20 April 1940. Initially, two designs were formulated, both using the Continental IV-1430 engines. One would be a single-seat aircraft with one 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and four .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. The second would be a two-seat aircraft with the addition of a flexible .50 in (12.7 mm) gun at the end of each tail boom.Francillon 1982, p. 252. In July 1940, Lockheed decided to switch to Pratt & Whitney XH-2600 engines as the aircraft would be underpowered with the Continental engines, with the aircraft having two seats and designated \\"XP-58\\". However, soon Lockheed was advised the development of the XH-2600 engine was terminated. After consideration of the engine alternatives, the design was changed to use two Wright R-2160 Tornado engines, as well as a change of the rear-facing armament to two turrets, one upper and the other lower on the fuselage, each turret containing two .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. As support equipment for the two crewmen was added, the estimated weight of the XP-58 grew to by August 1941.Green 1961, p. 124. In March 1942, the USAAF placed an order for a second XP-58 that would incorporate increased fuel tanks to obtain a range of 3,000 mi (4,800 km). The Air Force were uncertain about the role and armament of the aircraft, and in September 1942, a decision was made to convert the aircraft for a role as a low-altitude attack aircraft, armed with a 75 mm (2.95 in) M5 autocannon. Adequate aircraft were already available for this mission, with the Douglas A-26 Invader and Beechcraft XA-38 Grizzly under development. As a result, the second XP-58 was canceled and the role of the design reverted to that of a high-altitude fighter, using large-bore cannon firing high-explosive shells to break up bomber formations.Francillon 1982, p. 254.Green 1961, pp. 124‚Äì125. The 37 mm (1.46 in) M4 autocannon was originally selected for a quadruple mount in the nose, but the trajectory of the 37mm shells dropped lower than other weaponry, limiting its effective range. A hydraulically articulated nose that could be bent up to correct this problem was tried, but was dismissed as too complex. Then, a 75 mm (2.95 in) M5 autocannon paired with twin .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns was tried and proved much more successful. Testing In February 1943, use of another engine, the Allison V-3420, was necessary due to poor progress with the Tornado engine development. With this change, the second XP-58 was resurrected. The XP-58 had its first flight on 6 June 1944, but flight test work on the XP-58 took second place to other higher priority developments. Eventually, 25 test flights were completed. The XP-58 was then flown to Wright Field for USAAF acceptance tests, even though the turbo-superchargers were experiencing torching and a number of systems were not installed including provision for cockpit pressurization and armament with its fire-control equipment. Although the prototype arrived at Wright Field on 22 October 1944, the aircraft was a maintenance headache and no further trials were conducted. The construction of the second prototype was abandoned. Specifications (XP-58) Lockheed XP-58 Chain Lightning side view. See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Francillon, Ren√© J.

The term \\"Superman Family\\" is often used to refer to the extended cast of characters of comics books associated with Superman. A similarly titled series, Superman Family Adventures, was published in 2012‚Äì2013. Publication history The Superman Family was an amalgamation of the titles Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, and Supergirl. The first issue, #164, took its numbering from Jimmy Olsen, which had reached issue #163 and thus had the most issues published. Lois Lane ended at #137, while the newly launched Supergirl book had only made it to #9 at the time. A 10th and final issue of Supergirl was published five months after Superman Family's launch. The Superman Family went through two distinct phases. In its inception the three leads Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, and Supergirl rotated new stories each issue with reprints for the other characters. The first six issues (#164‚Äì169) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format and Nick Cardy was the cover artist. Changes were made in the setting of Supergirl's adventures during the character's run in the title. She moves to Florida to join the faculty at the New Athens Experimental School in issue #165. In an \\"imaginary tale\\" set in a possible future in issue #200, Supergirl, now known as Superwoman, is depicted as being the Governor of Florida in her secret identity of Linda Danvers. She leaves Florida and relocates to New York City to become a soap opera actress in issue #208. After the cancellation of Super- Team Family, a Supergirl/Doom Patrol team-up originally scheduled to appear in that title was published in The Superman Family #191‚Äì193. Supergirl battled the Enchantress in issues #204‚Äì205 and teamed with the Legion of Super-Heroes in issue #207. The Superman Family became the first DC Comics series in the 80-page Dollar Comic format, consisting of 64 pages of new stories, beginning with issue #182 (March‚ÄìApril 1977). With that issue, the \\"framing element\\" was removed from the covers, and the book switched to printing all-new material. It became a monthly series in 1981, starting with issue #207. Featured series *Lois Lane‚ÄîThe adventures of Lois Lane, where she regularly battled criminals. (#166, #169, #172, #175, #178, #181‚Äì222) *Supergirl‚ÄîThe adventures of Supergirl.

This feature had moved over from Superman after issue #328 of that series. (#182, #191‚Äì196) After the cancellation of The Superman Family, it returned to Superman for two more appearances in issues #371 and 373. *Mr. and Mrs. Superman‚ÄîThe adventures of the Earth-Two Superman and his wife, Lois Lane Kent.

(#182‚Äì194) DC published several other ... Family titles concurrently with The Superman Family. These included Batman Family (1975‚Äì78), Super-Team Family (1975‚Äì78) and Tarzan Family (1975‚Äì76). As a rule, DC's other ... Family titles contained mostly reprints and featured a higher page count and higher price than DC's other titles. With issue #222 (September 1982), The Superman Family was canceled and replaced with The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl, which briefly featured a \\"Lois Lane\\" backup series. Superman Family Adventures In 2012, DC launched a new series titled Superman Family Adventures written by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani and drawn by Baltazar. Baltazar and Aureliani are the winners of the 2011 Eisner Award in the category \\"Best Publication for Kids\\" for their work on the Tiny Titans title for DC. Fuzzy the Krypto Mouse, a character who appeared in a single story in Superboy #65 (June 1958), inspired a similar character created by Baltazar for Superman Family Adventures. Superman Family Adventures ended with issue #12.

Also known as the Volksmaschinenpistole (\\"people's machine pistol\\"), the weapon was closely based on the Sten Mk II submachine gun, except for its vertical magazine; some had additional pistol grips. The MP 3008 was an emergency measure, designed at a time when Germany was at the point of collapse. Desperately short of raw materials, the Germans sought to produce a radically cheaper alternative to their standard submachine gun, the MP 40. The MP 3008 was a simple blowback design operating from an open bolt. It was crudely manufactured in small machine shops and variations were common. Typically, the magazine was bottom-mounted unlike the side-mounted Sten. Initially all steel without handgrips, the wire buttstock was welded to the frame and was typically triangular, however the design changed as conditions inside Germany worsened and on final guns wooden stocks and other variations are found. The Ger√§t Potsdam, another version of the Sten Mk II produced by Mauser in 1944, was an exact copy of the original Sten, right down to its manufacturing stamps in an effort to conceal its origin for clandestine operations.

The transition to digital television is a process that is happening at different paces around the world. Although digital satellite television is now commonplace, the switch to digital cable and terrestrial television has taken longer. See also Digital terrestrial television. Not all countries are compatible within each standard DVB-T, ATSC (North America), DTMB (China), ISDB (of which there are two incompatible variations used in Japan and South America respectively). Countries that have adopted digital terrestrial recently may have a single MPEG4 based system for SD and HD, while countries with more established system may use MPEG2 for SD and MPEG4 for HD. There are also variations in middleware used. For example, Italy, Ireland and the UK are all DVB-T regions, but Ireland uses \\"MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T\\" for both SD and HD transmissions, while the UK uses \\"MPEG2 + MHEG5 + DVB-T\\" for SD and \\"MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T2\\" for HDTV, and Italy uses MHP rather than MHEG5 middleware. Since all MPEG4-capable receivers can decode the MPEG2 codec and all DVB-T2 tuners are capable of tuning DVB-T signals, UK HD set-top boxes are compatible with both the UK SD system and Irish SD/HD system, but Irish SD/HD tuners will only work with the SD system used in the UK. Digital cable broadcast tends to be DVB-C or very similar QAM in almost all countries. Broadband on cable is mostly DOCSIS which is DVB-C on the download path. This is important when buying a TV or set-box online rather than from a local retailer who would normally only stock the compatible system. Incompatible retail products are a severe problem in emerging retail digital markets where a neighbouring country has an older standard and dominates the retail trade, such as UK Freeview (rather than compatible \\"Freeview HD\\") products in Ireland. Important DVB-T standards are UK D-book for UK Freeview and Nordig 2.2 for Scandinavia and Ireland. Ireland deviates from Nordig by using UK profile MHEG5 middleware rather than MHP. DTT broadcasting systems. Africa = Botswana = ISDB-T International is adopted as the first country in Africa on February 26, 2013, evaluated the hierarchical mode of operation, which allows for the simultaneous transmission to fixed, mobile and portable receivers from a single transmitter, advantageous over DVB-T2. Broadcasting in digital drives to transform Botswana into an E-Society. =Mozambique= The earliest form of digital television in Mozambique began in 1996 with Southern African pay-TV operator DStv. Channels were transmitted and received via satellites and digital decoders. Some years later, TVCabo, began transmitting at first through analog and later digital means using decoders and an extensive fiber optic network. On January 18, Mozambique's Ministry of Transport and Communications announced that the country would be adopting the DVB-T2 system for transmission of terrestrial television channels. The implementation is expected to be completed by 2015. =Morocco= National Television Company in Morocco started DVB-T based digital TV deployment in February 2007. Digital TV is now available in the following cities and their regions: Casablanca, Benslimane, Settat, Nouaceur, Mediouna, Mohammedia, Rabat, Sal√©, Skhirat- Temara, Kenitra, Sidi Kacem, Khemisset, Meknes, Fes, Oujda, Tanger and Marrakech. =Namibia= While Namibia's public broadcasters still rely on analogue transmission and have not announced a transition date to digital television, the pay-TV operator MultiChoice already operates a digital television service using the DVB-T standard. =South Africa= The first digital television implementation in South Africa was a satellite-based system launched by pay-TV operator MultiChoice in 1995. On 22 February 2007 the South African government announced that the country's public TV operators would be broadcasting in digital by 1 November 2008, followed by a three-year dual- illumination period which would end on 1 November 2011. The government in January 2011 announced a change in its choice of technology from DVB-T to DVB-T2 with the analog switch off date postponed to December 2013. The rollout of digital television has been further delayed until 2017. Asia =Afghanistan= The Oqaab service using DVB-T2 was launched in 2015. =Cambodia= A digital television trial was completed on November 9, 2000 ‚Äì May 31, 2001 and was officially launched on November 9, 2010 by TV5. Analog switch-off will be 2015-2020. As at 2017, Phnom Penh Cable Television and One TV offer encrypted DVB-T2 pay TV services, viewable only with a subscription and set top box with card. In Phnom Penh, the following channels are available free to air: S Movie, SREPLAY (ETV), S Cinema, Nice TV, Fox Sports, Fox Action Movies, ARY Musik, CGTN Documentary, YTN World, SanSha TV, OneTV Sabay 1 =China= In June and September 2003, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) selected 41 experimental spots for digital television trials and launched the trials later before year end 2003. Later, according to the Tenth Five Year Plan and 2010 long-range plan for radio, film and television, SARFT drafted a switch-off timetable for different levels of Chinese cities, towns and counties, in which it was commanded that by 2010 digital broadcasting be implemented overall and by 2015 analog televisions be phased out completely. It was estimated that by year end 2007, China would have over 27 million digital TV users. In 2004, debates arose about whether the digital television technology by Tsinghua University or Shanghai Jiao Tong University should be adopted as the national standards. Finally, in late July 2007, China announced the final version of standards as a combined one and Tsinghua succeeded in this battle as 95% of its technology has been adopted. On September 1, 2005, the first HDTV channel in China, which would be broadcast nationwide later, began to air in Hangzhou. =Hong Kong= On December 31, 2007, local broadcasters started to air HDTV (1920X1080i) using Chinese DTMB standard. Currently, there are 12 HD channels airing 24 hours daily. Hong Kong broadcasters are keen to use whichever standard China adopts, since doing so would allow them to transmit into the lucrative market in Southern China, and would lessen the need for costly format conversion. =India= In India there are over 600 Satellite television channels that are being broadcast as of 2012. India has adopted DVB-T system for digital television in July 1999.http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/dvb_worldwide/india/ The first DVB-T transmission was started on 26 January 2003 in the four major metropolitan cities by Doordarshan. Currently the terrestrial transmission is available in both digital and analog formats. The Cable Digitalisation act mandates all cable television networks to turnoff analogue transmission and switch to digital transmission by 31 March 2015. The digital transition is planned over four phases in the country.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-04/india/28376135_1_set- top-boxes-digital-cable-tv-digital-systemsTata Sky Dish India The first analogue transmission cutoff date is set to 1 November 2012, for the four major metropolitan cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai). The Second analogue transmission cutoff date is 31 March 2013 for Patna, Chandigarh, Pune and Bengaluru. The third analogue transmission cutoff date is 30 November 2014 for all urban areas including state capitals. The analogue transmission cut off date for all other cities in the country is set for 31 March 2015.The switchover is tollaly completed in December 2016 Digital television is also available through Direct To Home service. These services are provided using locally built satellites from ISRO such as INSAT 4CR, INSAT 4A, INSAT-2E, INSAT-3C and INSAT-3E as well as private satellites such as the Dutch-based SES, Global-owned NSS 6, Thaicom-2 and Telstar 10. India currently has seven major DTH service providers and a total of over 23 million subscriber households in 2010.http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/2377-mn-dth- subscribers-by-june-2010-trai/111180/on These are Dish TV(a ZEE TV subsidiary), Tata Sky, Sun Network owned 'Sundirect DTH', Reliance owned BIG TV, Bharti Airtel's DTH Service 'Airtel Digital TV' and the public sector DD Direct Plus. As of 2010, India has the most competitive Direct-broadcast satellite market with seven operators vying for more than 110 million TV homes. India overtook USA as the world's largest Direct-broadcast satellite market in 2012.http://businesstoday.intoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&issueid;=89&id;=15742&Itemid;=1&sectionid;=25 =Indonesia= Indonesia began experimenting with digital TV broadcasting in 2008. In January 2014, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the Communication and Information Technology Regulation, removing requirements for an analog shut-off and allowing local analogue broadcasters to rent back channels allocated to digital broadcasting. From August 2014, UHF DVB-T2 equipment has been available for public purchase. =Iran= Iran started the transition to digital TV broadcasting in 2009 using DVB-T MPEG-4 standard. Iran plans to completely switch over to digital TV by 2015. As of summer of 2011, Iranian digital TV broadcast covered 40% of Iran's population. =Israel= The Knesset approved the law regarding DTT in late 2007. The Second Authority for Television and Radio is responsible for the deployment of the system - the project name is \\"Idan+\\". The package consists of 6 channels: IBA1, IBA33, Channel 2, Channel 10, Channel 23 (Israeli Educational Television) and The Knesset Channel. DVB-T broadcasts using the MPEG-4 Part 10, H.264 (AVC) video and HE AAC+ V2 audio codecs were launched in mid-2009. There were proceedings in the Knesset to add local music channel 24 to the system as well. Full technical details along with a map of the country showing transmitter locations can be found here and here . Additional channels will be added using the DVB-T2 standard already testing since 2014 in central Israel, showing mainly IBA-TV1 HD channel and various tests in Dolby Digital . =Japan= Japan pioneered HDTV with an analog implementation. The old system is not compatible with the new digital standards. Japanese terrestrial broadcasting of HD via ISDB-T started on December 1, 2003 in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas of Japan, and expanded to the outer areas before September 30, 2007. It has been reported that 31 million HD receivers have been sold in Japan as of January 2008. The Japanese government is studying the implementation of some improvements on the standard as suggested by Brazilian researchers (SBTVD). These new features are unlikely to be adopted in Japan due to incompatibility problems, but are being considered for use in future implementations in other countries, including Brazil itself. The move to DTV by consumers is relatively slow, partly because high-definition televisions are very expensive. Additionally, there have been issues with the B-CAS system and Digital Rights Management in respect to the home recording of broadcasts. On December 20, 2007, the Japanese electronics industry association set the rule (of copy control) for DTT broadcasting that allows consumers up 10 times more dubbing of entire TV program with video and audio into DVD recorder, etc. by way of a new program called . Dubbing 10 was planned to start on June 2, 2008, but it was postponeddue to an unresolved business political issue among concerning parties. A settlement with the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers was reached on June 15, and it was later confirmed on June 24 that the Dubbing 10 program will start on July 4, 2008. The manufacturers for the DVD and associated DTT recorders will make the units conform to the \\"Dubbing 10\\" rule and some manufacturers might release the downloading subprograms to update the recorder's internal software for existing users. On April 3, 2008, DPA (The Association for Promotion of Digital Broadcasting-Japan) announced that there has been a total 32.71 million of DTT (ISDB-T) receiving television sets (except 1seg receivers) installed in Japan as of end of March 2008. DPA also announced the guideline documentation to manufacturers who make the DTT receiver, recorder and replay units to operate with the personal computer on April 8, 2008. This add-on unit operates on USB or PCI BUS, and went on sale in May 2008. From January 22 to January 24, 2010, analog television broadcasting was suspended for 48 hours as part of a rehearsal to approximately 7,000 homes in Suzu and parts of Noto.„Ç¢„Éä„É≠„Ç∞ÂÅúÊ≥¢ÂÆüÈ®ì Âïè„ÅÑÂêà„Çè„ÅõÁõ∏Ê¨°„Åê (lit. Analog stop experiment, inquiries arisen) 2010-01-23Asahi com(in Japanese)Yomiuri Shimbun, 2010-01-25 ver.13S, pade34 On September 24, 2010 at noon, analog TV transmissions officially ended in Suzu and parts of Noto (approximately 8,800 homes) as part of the rehearsal plan that took place one year ahead of the nationwide shutdown, which was scheduled to start on July 24, 2011. Though this analog broadcasting shutdown was isolated to a small, rural area, it was the first complete analog shutdown in Asia outside of Israel.Yomiuri Shimbun, 2010-07-25 ver.13S, page3 On April 20, 2011, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications confirmed that the analog terrestrial TV service will shut down on July 24 in 44 of the 47 prefectures. The three prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima were heavily damaged by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and its related nuclear accidents, and as a result, television stations in those three prefectures shut down their analog signals nine months later on March 31, 2012. =South Korea (Republic of Korea)= After a long controversy between the government and broadcasters in South Korea, ATSC was chosen over DVB-T. Since 2005, digital services have been available across the entire country. South Korea also developed its own mobile TV standard called DMB, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting, based on the European technology af Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB). It has a satellite, subscription-based, version (S-DMB), and a free, terrestrial version (T-DMB). T-DMB encountered a wide success, both in South Korea and abroad. For more details see Digital Multimedia Broadcasting. =Malaysia= Malaysia started DVB-T tests in 2006, and the first DTTB services were rolled out in a few areas of the country in January 2014. On 6 June 2017, digital television officially launched in the country with the launch of MYTV Broadcasting. 16 channels are being broadcast on the service, including: TV1, TV2, TV3, NTV7, 8TV, TV9, TV Okey, TV Alhijrah, Bernama, Berita RTM, RTM Sports, Drama Sangat, CJ Wow Shop, Awesome TV, Go Shop. broadcast is scheduled to be phasing out in stages by 3rd quarter of 2019. Langkawi become the first area of analogue television switch off that were executed on 21 July at 02:30 AM (UTC+8). Further on 6 August, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Ministry released a complete list of transition date on the remaining areas with central and southern West Malaysia to be commenced on 19 August, northern West Malaysia on 2 September, eastern coast West Malaysia on 17 September and entire East Malaysia on 30 September. The switch over in West Malaysia are fully completed on 16 October at 12:30 AM (UTC+8), while the final switch over in East Malaysia are completed on 31 October also at 12:30 AM (UTC+8) as scheduled.

The commission decided to have UHF TV channels 14-51 at frequency spectrum 470-698 MHz given over to digital broadcast. The commission opted not to choose the ATSC standard, although the Philippines uses the NTSC-M standard. Instead the country started test trials of two different standards, those being the DVB of Europe and ISDB of Japan. Many broadcasters agreed to adopt the Japanese ISDB but some opted for the European DVB. On June 11, 2010, the National Telecommunications Commission of the Philippines announced that the country would adopt the ISDB standard. The first fully operational digital TV channel in the country is GEM-TV49 of the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo. While the Japanese ISDB-T standard was adopted for terrestrial digital TV transmission, digital cable and satellite TV providers in the Philippines such as SkyCable and Cignal use the European DVB system for service distribution. =Saudi Arabia= The first phase of digital terrestrial television (DTT) transmission in Saudi Arabia was launched on the 11 June 2006 in the main cities of Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, the ArabNews reports. Assistant Deputy Minister of Culture and Information for Engineering Affairs, Riyadh Najm, said: \\"The southern city of Abha and the central city of Buraidah will also have the facility within this month.\\" He added, \\"By February next year (20??) the DTT system will cover not less than 23 cities and that accounts for more than 70 percent of the population\\". He also said the DTT technology would allow people to receive all the four Saudi channels (Channel One, Channel Two, Arriyadiah and Al Ekhbariya) as well as the Saudi radio programmes (General Programme, Radio Qur‚Äôan, Second Programme and European Programme) with better clarity. =Singapore= Singapore's digital TV (DTV) journey started in 2012 when it was announced that the nation's free-to-air TV channels will go fully digital using the DVB-T2 (Digital Video Broadcasting ‚Äì Second Generation Terrestrial) broadcasting standard. Since December 2013, all seven Mediacorp channels have been broadcast in digital. All seven of these channels are broadcast in high definition (HD) ‚Äì Suria, Channel 5, Channel U, Channel 8, Vasantham and Channel NewsAsia. Okto Closed 2019 On 6 November 2017, MDA announced that analogue television would cease to broadcast entirely by the end of 2018, up from the intended 19 February 2018, to facilitate more time for majority of Singaporeans to switch to DTV as soon as possible. The analogue broadcast was finally ceased on 2 January 2019. The adoption of the DVB-T2 standard was decided after a successful trial that was conducted with free-to-air broadcaster Mediacorp. The trial, which involved some 500 households in Ang Mo Kio and Bedok estates, showed that DVB-T2 was suitable for deployment in Singapore's urbanised environment. DVB-T2 also offers higher efficiency, robustness and flexibility, enabling efficient use of valuable terrestrial spectrum for the delivery of audio, video and data services to fixed, portable and mobile devices. You Can Watch All Mediacorp Singapore Digital TV Channels on DVB-T2 Decoder In Singapore, Malaysia (Johor), =Sri Lanka= The first Television network of Sri Lanka was launched on 13 April 1979. The ITN channel, owned by the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka. On June 5, 1979 ITN was converted to a government-owned business and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC). Significant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks. Subsequently, the MTV Channel network was launched in collaboration with Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel). Since then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka. The national telecommunications provider, Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008. MTV Channel had introduced Sri Lanka's first 24-hour Television channel,\\"Sirasa TV\\" on the 2009 as a thought to satisfy the thoughts of the public to analyse the ongoing global affairs. =Taiwan= Digital television launched terrestrially throughout Taiwan on July 2, 2004. Currently, there are simulcasts of analogue and digital television. Taiwan plans to replace analogue broadcasting with a digital system by 2012. To assist lower-income families with the switch to digital television, the government plans to provide NT$300 million in aid to purchase converters or for the purchase of new digital televisions. =Thailand= The first digital television service in Thailand was launched by satellite based pay-TV operator IBC in 1996 using the DVB-S system. Starting from December 2000, the Thai national broadcaster Modernine TV began its trial Digital Terrestrial Digital Television (DDTV) service for six months to 2000 selected households in the capital city of Bangkok and surrounding areas on UHF Band 658 MHz and 674 MHz (or Channel 44 and 46) using the DVB-T standard. The trial DDTV service will ofcurrent \\"current\\" 2 analogue TV channels (i.e. Modernine TV and TV3) in digital, and 2 new digital-only channels, namely MCOT 1 and ASEAN TV. Also provided under the service are seven FM radio stations in digital audio and interactive services. Nationwide implementation is planned to begin by the year 2007 or 2008, although as of August 2008 digital transmission is still only available in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and possibly deferred. Even though MCOT's trial was a success, the future of the digital terrestrial television transition has become uncertain, especially after the end of Somchai Wongsawat's tenure as the Prime Minister and the beginning of successor Abhisit Vejjajiva. All the above digital television services are in standard definition and MCOT would have initiated HDTV trials by 2009. =Vietnam= Vietnam tested DVB-T in 2003 from a national school in Ho Chi Minh City. A DVB-T channel is launching in 2001 by VTC Digital. DVBT2 was launched in 2011 in Vietnam by AVG - Audio Video Global JSC, now is MobiTV by Mobifone - Vietnam Mobile Telecom Services (from 26/2/2016). Analogue signals switched off on 01/11/2015 in Da Nang, Vietnam. Da Nang is the first city in Asean has launched analogue switch off successfully. Oceania =Australia= Digital Satellite There are many digital satellite TV services in Australia, these are, Foxtel, Austar, Selectv, Optus, TransACT and UBI World TV. Digital satellite television is popular with Foxtel and Austar alone reaching over one quarter of the nation's population. Digital Free-to-air Digital terrestrial television in Australia commenced on 1 January 2001, in the country's five most populous cities, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Digital services using DVB-T standards are available nationwide. Analogue transmissions were phased out between mid-2010 and December 2013.

In addition multiple IPTV services are available. =Belgium= Belgium now has three major forms of broadcast digital television: Terrestrial (DVB-T/DVB-H), Cable (DVB-C), and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition, IPTV services are available. In Belgium, all the regions have completed the analog switchover (DVB-T). =Bulgaria= =Croatia= Analogue terrestrial television was switched off in Croatia on 5 October 2010. Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) started to transmit DVB-S programmes in 1997. It transmits all four state-owned TV channels (HRT 1, HRT 2, HRT 3 and HRT 4), and three radio stations (HR 1, HR 2 and HR 3). Croatia started to test DVB-T transmission early in 2002. It transmitted 4 national TV channels (HRT 1, HRT 2, HRT 3 and Nova TV) on a network of 9 transmitters built by Oda≈°iljaƒçi i veze, completed in 2007 and covering about 70% of the country. Entire Croatia is covered with DVB-T in from 5 October 2010. The analogue switch-off process took place region by region, starting from January 2010 in Istria and Rijeka region and completing the switch-off on 5 October 2010 when the final region (Zagreb) was converted fully to DVB-T. MPEG-2/SDTV is selected as a platform for free-to-air channels, initially with two MUX channels covering, where MUX A would be used by public TV Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) and MUX B used by commercial TV stations, while later MUX C and MUX D will be populated by HD and regional channels, respectively. Croatia has started transition in 2019 to DVB-T2 HVEC for national broadcast. = Czech Republic = Analogue terrestrial television was switched off on 30 November 2011. Czech Republic launched first experimental DVB-T broadcast in May 2000, which was then made available to the public in October 2005. There are currently 4 primary multiplexes and 8 regional multiplexes (RS1-RS8). As of November 2019, Czech Republic started the transition to the DVB-T2 standard. This transition will be finished on 24 June 2020, when DVB-T broadcast will be terminated nationwide. =Finland= Analogue terrestrial television was switched off in Finland on 1 September 2007, and analogue cable television on 1 March 2008. All pay-TV channels switched to DVB-T2 in May 2017. Finland switches fully to DVB-T2 on March 31, 2020 =Ireland= In Ireland, there are a number of providers of digital television. These include Sky Ireland which is operated by Sky plc (available nationwide), while Virgin Media Ireland, Magnet Networks and Cablecomm provide various digital-cable services. Digital Television is also available by IPTV provider Magnet Networks. *In 2008 Boxer TV were awarded the position to operate Ireland's Digital Terrestrial Television platform which was meant to be rolled with RT√â NL over the next 5 years. This service was to offer subscription services and free-to-air channels sometime in late 2009 using MPEG4 standard. On 9 May 2009 it was reported OneVision were then likely to operate the pay DTT service. The official announcement was made later that month. Due to an economic downturn in the Irish economy, Boxer TV, which operated in Sweden and Denmark claimed it was unfeasible for the company to operate in Ireland. On 11 May 2009 it was reported Onevision would operate the pay DTT service. Further setbacks were announced on 9 July 2009 when it was confirmed by Ireland's national broadcaster that RT√â would not launch its DTT service until other media partners were ready to launch their services. The original launch date was September 2009 and finally took place in October 2010. =Italy= =Latvia= Latvia now has three major forms of broadcast digital television.

(MPEG-4) =Poland= Analogue broadcast switch-off started on 30 June 2011 and was completed by 31 July 2013. =Portugal= Portugal started its first digital broadcast with TVCabo Sat√©lite (nowadays known as \\"NOS TV Sat√©lite\\") in 1998, later, in 2001, implementation of Interactive services brought digital TV to the wired cable networks. While the Satellite branch was (and still is) popular in areas where the Cable branch is not available (such as remote areas and villages), iTV never became successful, and was later discontinued in 2002. Digital broadcast was still available under the name \\"powerbox\\" (after the STB used to receive the signal). In 2005, a little \\"analog switchover\\" happened, where coded analog channels (known as Premium) would cease broadcast in favour of powerbox. Every pay-TV provider offers digital television. As of 2010, all Premium channels in all pay-TV providers, are digital. DTT started on November 1, 2008 for Lisbon and Castelo Branco, and on April 26, 2009 for 80% of the country, and the government plans to cover the rest of the country until 2010-2011 New Year's Eve. Analog will then be switched off 6 months after TDT covers 87% of the country via terrestrial transmitters and 13% via satellite complementary coverage. =Romania= https://web.archive.org/web/20161127022323/http://www.tvdigitala.ro/acoperire/ http://www.dvbt.ro/ http://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie%20DVB-T2_Octombrie_2016.pdf = Serbia = The transition to DVB-T2 digital television in Serbia started on September 1, 2014, and was finished on June 1, 2015. Analogue terrestrial television was finally switched off on June 7, 2015. As of that day, nearly 97.8% of country's population is covered by digital signal. = Slovenia = Slovenia completed its switch to DVB-T (MPEG-4) on the 1st December 2010 with the termination of all analogue transmissions on a single day. There are two multiplexes carried nationwide as well as several local multiplexes. = Spain = The development of digital terrestrial television was very similar to the failure of ITV Digital in the United Kingdom. In 1999, digital terrestrial television was introduced in the country by the pay per view platform Quiero Television. In May 2002, statewide operators were required to start broadcasting in DVB-T. Yet, Quiero TV ceased transmissions in 2002 after a commercial failure. Unlike the UK, the three and half multiplexes left by the platform were not reassigned to other operators, and so 5 channels were squashed into a single multiplex. On 30 November 2005, digital terrestrial television was relaunched as a free service with 20 channels and 14 radio stations, along with 23 regional- and local-language channels in their respective areas. Each multiplex has a minimum of 4 SD channels each or one HD channel. By 2010, coverage reached over 98% of the population, and the analog signal was switched off on 2 April 2010. =Sweden= The shutdown of the analogue service in Sweden started on September 19, 2005 and was finished on October 29, 2007. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom now has five major forms of broadcast digital television, direct-to-home satellite services provided by British Sky Broadcasting (branded as Sky) and Freesat, digital cable television services provided by Virgin Media and WightFibre, and a free- to-air digital terrestrial service called Freeview. In addition there are two IPTV systems known as TalkTalk TV owned by The Carphone Warehouse, and BT Vision, which is provided by BT. Individual access methods vary throughout the country. Terrestrial The initial attempt at launching a digital terrestrial broadcasting service on November 15, 1998, ONdigital (later called ITV Digital), was unsuccessful and the company went into liquidation. ITV Digital was replaced in late 2002 by Freeview, which uses the same DVB-T technology, but with higher levels of error correction and more robust (but lower-capacity) modulation on the \\"Public Service\\" multiplexes in an attempt to counter the reception problems which dogged its predecessor. Rather than concentrating on Pay TV services, Freeview uses the available capacity to provide a free-to-air service that includes all the existing five free-to-air analogue terrestrial channels and about twenty new digital channels. All services are transmitted in SDTV mode. March 31, 2004 saw the return of a limited pay-television offering to the digital terrestrial platform with the launch of Top Up TV. This new service is designed to appeal to those who do not want to pay the high subscription fees that Sky Television and the Cable networks demand. The service carries a restricted hours service of some of the UK's most watched channels including the Discovery Channel, Gold, Discovery Real Time, British Eurosport and Cartoon Network, sharing just three different slots. In October 2006, Top Up TV renamed itself Top Up TV Anytime, taking advantage of the increase in the popularity of digital video recorders, and its limited channel space. Now over 100 programs (not channels) are broadcast overnight and added to the box's hard drive, and may be watched at any time. Channels that provide content for the overnight service include MTV, Nickelodeon and Hallmark Channel. 2005 saw the first areas of the United Kingdom losing their analogue signal in a pilot test. The residents of Ferryside and Llansteffan in Carmarthenshire, Wales who had not already upgraded to digital television were given a free set-top box to receive the Freeview television service, which includes Channel 4 (previously unavailable terrestrially from transmitters in Wales) and S4C2, which broadcasts sessions of the National Assembly for Wales. Digital transmissions for this pilot commenced in December 2004, at which time a message was added to the analogue picture advising viewers that the analogue services would end in February 2005. 2005 also saw the announcement by the regulator Ofcom about the proposed analogue switch off plans for the UK. The switch off progressed on an ITV region by region basis that began in 2008 with the Border region, and ended in the UTV region in 2012. The coverage of the three public service broadcasting multiplexes is the same as that enjoyed by the former analogue TV stations (98.5% of the population), while the three commercial multiplexes cover 90% of the population. =Freeview HD= The BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 ran terrestrial HDTV trials involving 450 homes in the London area during June‚ÄìDecember 2006 on locally unused frequencies. As part of this trial, the BBC broadcast BBC HD, which was free to air but could not be received by any set-top boxes commercially available at the time. It could however be received and played back by any PC equipped with a DVB-T card using a software H.264 decoder. With two channels (BBC HD and ITV HD), Freeview HD completed a \\"technical launch\\" on 2 December 2009 from the Crystal Palace and Winter Hill transmitters. This time, in addition to H.264 being used as the codec, the broadcast utilised DVB-T2 rather than the DVB-T used by standard Freeview and the earlier test broadcasts, thus requiring users to purchase new reception equipment. Freeview HD was the first operational TV service in the world to use the DVB-T2 standard. Freeview HD set-top boxes and televisions were made available at the consumer launch of the service in early 2010. In order to qualify for the Freeview HD logo, receivers need to be IPTV-capable and display Freeview branding, including the logo, on the electronic programme guide screen. On 25 March 2010 Channel 4 HD was added to Freeview HD on channel 52 with a placeholding caption; it launched on 30 March 2010, coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD. S4C Clirlun launched in April 2010 in Wales, where Channel 4 HD is not available. BBC One HD was also added to the service on 3 November 2010. Cable Virgin Media (formerly known as NTL:Telewest, after a merger of NTL Incorporated with Telewest Global, Inc.), became in 2006 the first \\"quadruple-play\\" media company in the United Kingdom, bringing together a service consisting of television, broadband internet, mobile phone and fixed-line telephone services. Virgin Media ranks as the UK's second largest pay TV service, having 3.6m subscribers and 55% national availability.The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report -Digital TV Q3 2007 , Ofcom. Retrieved on 23 February 2008 Trials of the UK's first HDTV service, the TVDrive PVR from Telewest, began on 1 December 2005 on a commercial pilot basis before a full launch in March 2006. Due to the merger between NTL and Telewest, the TVDrive was made available to NTL cable customers in the Teesside and Glasgow areas on 16 November 2006. In January 2007, NTL:Telewest began renting the STB nationwide and since the acquisition of the Virgin Media name, it is now officially available in all areas with the new V+ branding. Virgin Media is also the only cable provider to supply video on demand services. As of October 2009, Virgin Media are broadcasting seven HD channels with plans for further new HD channels during 2010. WightFibre also provide cable television to the residents of the Isle of Wight. Satellite On 1 November 2005 ITV turned off encryption on all of its satellite-based signals, following the lead from the BBC. These transmissions are on a limited spotbeam which is aimed primarily towards the United Kingdom, via the Astra 2D satellite located at 28.2 degrees east. This theoretically limits reception to Iceland, Ireland and the United Kingdom, allowing ITV to fulfil licensing agreements with content producers. However, many people report successful reception of these signals from across Europe by using larger dishes. Sky+ HD is offered by BSkyB in both Ireland and the United Kingdom as an add-on to their existing Sky subscription service. The BBC is broadcasting BBC HD as a free-to-air channel from the Astra 2D satellite, and the channel can be viewed for free with suitable satellite reception equipment. There are additional equipment and subscription charges for HD from Sky TV but they are broadcasting over 30 channels in the HD format. Sky also offers a free-to-air version of its regular Sky service known as Freesat from Sky. Freesat from Sky provides a non-subscription card for public service broadcast channels Channel 4 and Channel 5, however Film4, Film4+1 are free-to-air. On 12 July 2006, the BBC and ITV announced a free-to- air satellite service as a competitor to Freesat from Sky, to be called Freesat. The service was officially launched on 6 May 2008 and covers all BBC and ITV digital TV channels, plus interactive services, radio channels, and other channels. It is being touted as the satellite equivalent to Freeview, especially for areas unable to receive the Freeview DTT service. North America =Canada= The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has adopted the same digital television standard for stations in Canada as the United States. The CRTC initially decided not to enforce a single date for transitioning to digital broadcasts, opting to let the economy decide when the switchover will occur. However, a later decision settled on the date of August 31, 2011, limited to 30 markets.Canadian TV to go all-digital in 2011. Wikinews, 2007-05-17 http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canadian_TV_to_go_all-digital_in_2011 In addition, by August 31, 2011, all full power transmitters on channels 52 and above must either relocate to a lower channel or shut down. CITY-TV was the first Canadian station to provide digital terrestrial service. As of 2007, other digital stations on-air include the CBC and Radio-Canada stations in Toronto and Montreal, as well as CTV's CFTO and CIVT, and CKXT (SUN TV). This list is not necessarily exhaustive and other station launches are completed or pending, although most are in the largest markets of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. Also, this does not include digital or high definition versions of specialty channels. On November 22, 2003, CBC had their first broadcast in HD, in the form of the Heritage Classic outdoor NHL game between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. Bell Satellite TV, a Canadian satellite company, Rogers Cable and Vid√©otron provide somewhat more than 21 HDTV channels to their subscribers including TSN HD, Rogers Sportsnet HD, Discovery HD (Canadian Edition), The Movie Network HD, and several U.S. stations plus some PBS feeds and a couple of pay-TV movie channels. CTV Toronto broadcast in HD along with its western counterpart, BC CTV. They were also the first to broadcast a terrestrial HD digital ATSC signal in Canada. Global joined the crowd in late 2004. Other networks are continuing to announce availability of HD signals. CHUM Limited's Citytv in Toronto was the first HDTV broadcaster in Canada; however, now most cable and satellite subscribers across Canada can access multiple channels in HDTV with major American and Canadian affiliate stations broadcasting HDTV signals with no CANCON overlay for advertising. Typically these channels are NBC HD, ABC HD, CBS HD, Fox HD, TSN HD, Sportsnet HD, CBC HD, etc., as of summer 2006. CBC HD officially launched their HDTV programming on March 5, 2005. CBC HD broadcasts the first game of their Hockey Night in Canada Saturday double header in HDTV. The 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs games have seen an increased amount of HDTV coverage as well. =Mexico= Mexican television broadcaster Televisa made experimental HDTV broadcasts in the early-1990s, in collaboration with Japan's NHK, but the country moved to implement the ATSC standard like the rest of the North American continent. Today, the vast majority of events and programs are broadcast in high definition. Currently almost all the cable providers as well as SKY the major DTH provider offer HD channels. By the third quarter of 2005, HDTV transmissions from TV Azteca were available in Mexico's largest markets: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. Phase Two of TV Azteca's national roll-out brought HDTV services to six cities along the Mexico-U.S. border (Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexicali, and Tijuana) by the first half of 2006. This roll-out took advantage of HDTV receivers already in place thanks to an earlier HDTV roll-out by stations on the American side of the border. TV Azteca has also broadcast the Mexican football tournament in HDTV. XETV in Tijuana, Baja California, is on the air in HDTV using 720p format. This affiliate of the American CW Network is on UHF channel 23 broadcasting from Mt. San Antonio in Tijuana, with 403,000 watts, directed primarily northward at San Diego. In January 2006, Televisa's XEFB-TV and Multimedios' XHAW-TV in Monterrey began HDTV transmissions on UHF channels 48 and 50, respectively. In February 2006, Televisa's XHUAA in Tijuana began its HDTV transmissions on channel 20. Unfortunately they have no HDTV programs. Channel 20 broadcasts an upconverted version of the programs of XHUAA's analog signal on channel 57. Official plan for Mexican DTT Currently there are 38 digital channels in Mexico. They are: *11 in Mexico City *6 in Monterrey *5 in Guadalajara *5 in Tijuana *5 in Juarez *3 in Mexicali *2 in Reynosa *2 in Matamoros *3 in Nuevo Laredo The Analog signal was gradually switched off in 2015 and it no longer exists. =Greenland= The analog signal was switched off on 9 January 2012. Free-to-air digital terrestrial television using DVB-T is now covering all cities in Greenland, broadcasting TV and Radio stations from the Greenlandic and Danish broadcasting corporations. Subscription based digital terrestrial television is currently available in the capital Nuuk, Qaqortoq, Ilulissat and Qasigiannguit through Nuuk TV. In addition to channels from Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation, Nuuk TV, and Danish Broadcasting Corporation, the service offers additional channels from C More, and from American and European cable networks (typically subtitled in Danish). =United States= The United States has adopted ATSC standards for digital terrestrial broadcasts. These standards include standard definition, enhanced definition, and high definition formats. On May 8, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin J. Martin announced that the agency would test run the transition to digital television in Wilmington, North Carolina beginning September 8, 2008. This was in order to work out any kinks which may not be foreseen before most of the country's broadcasters stopped transmitting traditional analog signals and upgrade to digital-only programming. Full-power terrestrial broadcasts using the analog NTSC standard was required by law to cease by June 12, 2009.47 USC 309(j)(14)(A) as amended by section 3002 of S.1932 signed into law February 8, 2006. The deadline for full transition was deferred from February 17, 2009, to June 12, 2009, by a bill signed February 11, 2009. Some television sets will continue to use analog NTSC tuners if connected to an analog cable system, or a converter box (which may receive digital signals over the air, from a cable system, or from a satellite system). Low-power stations continue to broadcast in analog, but these must transition to digital by September 1, 2015, or go silent. Some Canadian or Mexican border signals may remain available in analog form to some US viewers after the shutdown of US-based full-power NTSC broadcasts. Central America = Costa Rica = Costa Rica chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T as 7th country on 25 May 2010, and started trial transmissions by Channel 13 from Iraz√∫ Volcano on 19 March 2012. =El Salvador= In the year 2017, the Government of El Salvador adopted the Japanese ISDB-T Platform. =Guatemala= Guatemala approved the use of Digital Broadcasting with the system ISDB-Tb =Honduras= Honduras was the first country in Central America to adopt a Digital TV standard, ATSC in 2007. Currently there are three digital channels broadcasting: \\"TEN Canal 10\\" was the first digital TV station in Honduras. It began broadcasting in 2007 in SDTV . CampusTv, is the first high definition TV station in Central America, CampusTv was founded by the University of San Pedro Sula La U Privada. The third channel is \\"La UTV\\" founded by the National Autonomous University of Honduras. =Panama= Panama approved the adoption of the European standard DVB-T to be used for the first time on the 2010 World Cup. South America =Argentina= After a bumpy ride of back and forths, Argentina officially selected the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-T International on August 28, 2009, and agreed with Japan to cooperate for resource exchange and technical transfer. While HDTV-ready TV sales are increasing in Argentina, no single HD feed is currently available by terrestrial television as of mid-2009, as the standard selection process wasn't officialized until August 28, 2009. As of this date only a few are available by cable, which are unregulated and use ATSC set top boxes installed at the customers' premises. Subscription TV provider Antina uses the DVB standard to deliver an alternative service to cable TV, using standard definition analog outputs. It is expected that the public TV stations begin transition to ISDB-T that the standard for Over-the-air transmissions has been set, and On air service started from 28 April 2010. As of September 2011, a few programs are available in 1080i@50 Hz and broadcast by air. That includes most of local football matches and a TV show hosted by Sergio Goycochea (former goalkeeper of Argentina's national football team), all of them on \\"TV P√∫blica HD\\"; and also soap operas such as \\"El Hombre de Tu Vida\\", \\"Cuando Me Sonre√≠s\\" and \\"Supertorpe\\", on Telefe HD. =Bolivia= Bolivia chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T International on 5 July 2010. =Brazil= The SBTVD standard (based on the Japanese standard ISDB-T) was adopted 29 June 2006 and launched on 2 November 2007. In 2007, only the greater S√£o Paulo metropolitan area could receive the signal. Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro began to receive free-to-air digital signal on April 7 and April 8, 2008, respectively. On August 4, 2008 and October 22, 2008, Goi√¢nia and Curitiba began to receive DTV signal, respectively. Digital broadcast started at Salvador on December 2 and Campinas on December 3, 2008. The government estimated 7 years for complete signal expansion over all of the territory. Analog television is scheduled to be shut down on October 25, 2017. The interactive platform called Ginga consists entirely of free software and received high publicity for being considered the main appeal for the change. The government promised WiMAX as return channel for the system, set to be implemented in the following years.CPqD - WiMAX poder√° ser o canal de retorno da TV digital. Testes come√ßam em setembro All 5 major TV networks (Band, Rede Globo, Rede Record, RedeTV! and SBT) broadcast in HDTV signal (1080i), SDTV 480i and 1seg as well. =Chile= TVN has made HDTV tests in 1999, Canal 13 is now broadcasting, in Santiago only, a test transmission in the three HDTV formats (ATSC, DVB and ISDB). In Valpara√≠so, UCV made ATSC broadcast tests for the Valparaiso area, and Canal 13 also has made tests in DVB format in April 2007 for the Valparaiso area. After rescheduling the date for a final decision on DTV formats several times, The government has stopped offering dates for such an announcement. On September 14, 2009, president Michelle Bachelet announced that the government had finally decided, after prolonged delays, on a digital television standard. Chile will be adopting the ISDB-T Japanese standard (with the custom modifications made by Brazil). Simulcasting is expected to begin in 2010, with a projected analog switch-off in 2017. Gobierno de Chile adopta norma de Televisi√≥n Digital para el Pa√≠s On September 10, 2010, TVN, Canal 13, Chilevisi√≥n, La Red, UCV, El Mostrador TV and NGB are transmitting digital signals in Santiago. TVN and Chilevisi√≥n tested 3D TV on free ISDB-T channels 30 and 33. Currently there are 13 digital channels in Santiago: *24.1 Canal 13 HD *24.2 Canal 13 C *26.1 El Mostrador HD *26.2 El Mostrador SD *27.1 Mega HD *28.1 La Red Digital *30.1 Chilevision HD 1 *30.2 Chilevision HD 2 *33.1 TVN HD 1 *33.2 TVN SD *36.1 Chilevision 2 (encrypted) *36.2 Canal de Noticias (encrypted) *36.3 Canal internacional (encrypted) =Colombia= On August 28, 2008 Colombia adopted the European digital terrestrial television standard, DVB-T. but on the 9th January 2012 changed this to DVB-T2. All transmissions now use DVB-T2 (6 MHz). Se√±al Colombia ‚ÄîColombia's state-owned channel‚Äî has made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests since 2006, in northwest Bogot√° and downtown Cartagena, transmitting into the three DTV formats ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T. Also, the Chinese standard DMB-T/H, was considered, but could not be tested. HDTV-ready television sets (DVB-T) have been available in Colombia since 2003, but cable companies have not broadcast HD content to their subscribers. Satellite television DirecTV Colombia offer HD channels. Preparations were made to launch DVB-T services in (tentatively) May 2009, when the first DTV transmitter was to go live (probably at Manjui hill in Facatativ√°). The launch was to initially allow 11 million households in the regions of Bogot√° D.C., Boyaca, Cundinamarca, north of Huila, Tolima, western Meta, and probably Caldas and Risaralda to watch DTV services. On December 28, 2010, Caracol TV and RCN TV officially started digital broadcasts for Bogot√°, Medell√≠n and surrounding areas on channels 14 and 15 UHF, respectively. Se√±al Colombia and Canal Institucional had started test digital broadcasts earlier in 2010. The Spanish Impulsa TDT, the association for the implementation of digital- terrestrial television and the Colombian government have signed an official agreement under which Spain will help the country implement DVB-T. = Ecuador = Ecuador chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T as 6th country on 26 March 2010.Ecuador is ready to migrate to Digital TV (2010-09-17) = Paraguay = Paraguay chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T on 1 June 2010. = Peru = Chosen the Brazilian modified version of the Japanese standard ISDB-T on 23 April 2009. Agreed with Japan to cooperate for resource exchange and technical transfer on 21 August 2009, and On air service started on Channel 7 of TV Per√∫ from 30 March 2010. 1seg is one of attractive system. Achieved first HD live demonstration and test program transmission using OB Van in aiming nationwide deployment with the Japanese cooperation in Trujillo for 3 days from 28 January 2011. =Uruguay= On August 27, 2007, the Uruguayan government issued a decree stating that the DVB-T and DVB-H standards will be adopted. While HDTV-ready TV sets are available at the country, a few factors seem to constrain the development of the new technology in the near term: * Prices for LCD, Plasma and DLP-based TV sets can be two times more expensive in Uruguay than in the region, or four times more expensive than in the US, while wages are also lower than in the region. Some DLP-based displays can cost up to US$7000 in Uruguay as of 2006. There have been few examples, if any, of CRT-based HDTV sets. * The cable industry has few incentives to provide other services beyond basic TV services: Internet-by-cable and cable telephony have been either strictly prohibited by law (Antel, the local telco company owned by the government and with a strong union, enjoys a monopoly on basic telephony services and land lines) or thwarted by high taxes on equipment that make a business case for newer technologies unfeasible. Digital Cable has started rolling out, with an initial 100% increase of monthly cost for the SD digital service. High prices for HDTV sets do not help. Some of the cable companies for the largest markets are also owned by the largest local TV content providers, which as of 2006 have not started broadcasting any HDTV content since there has not been an approval of which standard is to be used by the government. * DirecTV might be in a better position to provide HDTV content, given that they have experience and content from the US and given that they serve the whole continent. But DirecTV's policy in Uruguay has been that of providing \\"leftover\\" equipment from Argentina to its customers in Uruguay (i.e., first-generation RCA receivers), which do not yet support HDTV content or Dolby AC-3 Sound. * Uruguay hoped for neighboring countries reaching an agreement on an HDTV standard, but so far that does not seem to be the case. Brazil has adopted the ISDB system, while Argentina and Uruguay have historically used TV systems based on a European standard (PAL-N 625/50 Hz). Argentina seemed to be settling on the ATSC standard before 2009, and Uruguayan URSEC authorities have provided no information on which road they will go. On August 27, 2007, URSEC settled on DVB-T and DVB-H. The TV sets being sold in Uruguay seem to be closer to ATSC HDTV-based standards (60 Hz systems, with ATSC tuners in some cases). Most of the DVD-based content in the country is NTSC/60 Hz-based, while the TV standard in use is PAL/50 Hz-based. Most of the analog TV sets sold are PAL-N, PAL-M and NTSC capable, while most DVD players are multi-region. Authorities are not asking retailers to identify which standard the HDTV sets sold adhere to. Uruguayan government decided to adopt ISDB-T for geopolitical reasons and to be consistent relations with Argentina and Brazil on December 27, 2010, Uruguayans will start receiving digital television signals by the end of 2012, and scheduling analog signals blackout will be in 2014-2015. = Venezuela = On October 6, 2009, Venezuela has officially adopted ISDB-T with Brazilian modifications. Transition from analog to digital is expected to take place in the next 10 years.Venezuela adopt√≥ est√°ndar japon√©s de televisi√≥n digital terrestre(Venezuela adopted Japanese terrestrial digital television standard) Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias (in Spanish) The seven stages of Set-top box manufacturing, testing and implement schedule is well proceeding and will start to deploy DTT from 2011.

It officially started on May 15, 1985, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1985, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1985. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. At the time, the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific, with 28 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 24 were named, 13 reached hurricane intensity, and 8 became major hurricanes by attaining Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At that time, the 24 named storms was a record; however, this record was broken seven years later in 1992, and was therefore recognized as the second busiest season within the basin, until it was surpassed exactly thirty years later by the 2015 season. Despite the activity, only one system made landfall in 1985. Hurricane Waldo caused moderate damage in Northwestern Mexico and one death in Kansas. Surf from Hurricanes Pauline and Rick caused minor damage in Hawaii. Hurricane Nele resulted in disruption in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, while Hurricane Ignacio threatened Hawaii, but only ended up producing light rainfall and minimal damage. __TOC__ Seasonal summary ImageSize = width:800 height:205 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1985 till:08/12/1985 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1985 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:05/06/1985 till:12/06/1985 color:TS text:\\"Andres (TS)\\" from:06/06/1985 till:16/06/1985 color:C3 text:\\"Blanca (C3)\\" from:07/06/1985 till:10/06/1985 color:TS text:\\"Carlos (TS)\\" from:26/06/1985 till:05/07/1985 color:C3 text:\\"Dolores (C3)\\" from:27/06/1985 till:05/07/1985 color:TS text:\\"Enrique (TS)\\" from:02/07/1985 till:06/07/1985 color:TS text:\\"Fefa (TS)\\" from:07/07/1985 till:12/07/1985 color:TS text:\\"Guillermo (TS)\\" barset:break from:11/07/1985 till:12/07/1985 color:TD text:\\"Eight (TD)\\" from:18/07/1985 till:20/07/1985 color:TS text:\\"Hilda (TS)\\" from:20/07/1985 till:29/07/1985 color:C4 text:\\"Jimena (C4)\\" from:21/07/1985 till:27/07/1985 color:C4 text:\\"Ignacio (C4)\\" from:29/07/1985 till:06/08/1985 color:TS text:\\"Kevin (TS)\\" from:29/07/1985 till:08/08/1985 color:TS text:\\"Linda (TS)\\" from:06/08/1985 till:13/08/1985 color:C1 text:\\"Marty (C1)\\" barset:break from:19/08/1985 till:23/08/1985 color:TS text:\\"Nora (TS)\\" from:20/08/1985 till:22/08/1985 color:TD text:\\"One-C (TD)\\" from:22/08/1985 till:31/08/1985 color:C1 text:\\"Olaf (C1)\\" from:27/08/1985 till:09/09/1985 color:C1 text:\\"Pauline (C1)\\" from:30/08/1985 till:31/08/1985 color:TS barset:break barset:skip barset:skip barset:skip barset:skip from:08/09/1985 till:08/09/1985 color:TS text:\\"Skip (TS)\\" from:01/09/1985 till:12/09/1985 color:C4 text:\\"Rick (C4)\\" from:05/09/1985 till:17/09/1985 color:C3 text:\\"Sandra (C3)\\" barset:break from:15/09/1985 till:24/09/1985 color:C3 text:\\"Terry (C3)\\" from:18/09/1985 till:21/09/1985 color:TS text:\\"Vivian (TS)\\" from:01/10/1985 till:02/10/1985 color:TD text:\\"Twenty-Two (TD)\\" from:07/10/1985 till:09/10/1985 color:C2 text:\\"Waldo (C2)\\" from:23/10/1985 till:30/10/1985 color:C1 text:\\"Nele (C1)\\" from:25/10/1985 till:05/11/1985 color:C3 text:\\"Xina (C3)\\" from:21/11/1985 till:21/11/1985 color:TD text:\\"Twenty-Five (TD)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0, -20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1985 till:01/07/1985 text:June from:01/07/1985 till:01/08/1985 text:July from:01/08/1985 till:01/09/1985 text:August from:01/09/1985 till:01/10/1985 text:September from:01/10/1985 till:01/11/1985 text:October from:01/11/1985 till:01/12/1985 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale)\\" This year, 25 tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific (140¬∞W to North America). Of those systems, three never strengthened beyond the depression stage, while 22 were named. This total was six storms above the 1966-1985 average seven above the 1971-2006 average and nine above the 1949-2006 average of 13. With a total 26 tropical cyclones and 24 named storms, this season was the most active on record, breaking the short-lived record held by the 1983 Pacific hurricane season,Gunther & Cross 1932 though the 1992 Pacific hurricane season surpassed this record. This season is now the third-most active, being recently also surpassed by the 2015 Pacific hurricane season, which is now the second-most active overall. Of the named systems, 10 peaked as tropical storms, 12 as hurricanes, and 8 reached the intensity of major hurricanes by attaining Category 3 strength or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The season lasted 170 days, three days longer than the 1984 Pacific hurricane season, but still then days longer than normal. The Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) issued 620 bulletins during the season, 35 more than the previous season. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (140¬∞W to the international dateline), three tropical cyclones formed. One of those stayed as a tropical depression through its life. One strengthened into a hurricane, and another crossed into the northwestern Pacific before eventually returning to the central Pacific. Although meteorologists expected a below-normal season, the season got on to a fast start though no storms formed in May. The activity picked up significantly thereafter, with five storms forming in June, including one major hurricane and was the most active month of June on record at the time, although this mark was tied in 2018. By the middle of July, a total of 10 storms had formed with another tropical storm forming off the coast of Central America roughly every 10 days. Throughout July, a record seven named storms formed, although this mark was matched in 2015 and 2016. Within two more weeks, 13 tropical storms or hurricanes had formed, including 4 major hurricanes. By August 23, 2 more storms had been named. By early September, a total of 17 named storms had developed, 6 of which became hurricanes. Roughly two weeks later, two additional named storms were classified. After a lull in late September and early October, a total of 22 storms had formed by mid- October 21 of which developed in the EPHC's area of responsibility and the list of names was exhausted, forcing the agency to request emergency names. The cause of the high activity in 1985 is unknown; however, this year continued a trend of above average season that began in 1981. The hurricane season took place during a La Ni√±a event, which tends to inhibit Pacific hurricane activity. However, 1985 was during a warm phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation and in the middle of an era where all but the 1988 Pacific hurricane season were near or above average. Several storms were investigated by hurricane hunter aircraft in 1985; the first was on July 24 during Hurricane Ignacio. On September 10, a flight was made into Hurricane Rick, where the storms lowest pressure was recorded. Hurricane Sandra was investigated on September 12 on the way from Hawaii, where the hunters were on standby. The final two flights of the season were made on September 21 and 22 into Hurricane Terry while the storm was located off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula. In addition to Hurricane Hunter aircraft, the National Weather Service satellite station provided the basin with adequate satellite converge. The earlier loss of a GOES-East satellite and the move of a GOES-west satellite further west had little effect on EPHC operations. Enhanced infrared imagery was especially useful in determining cold-core centers. Even though the early season storms were no threat to land, there were several notable storms during the season, with one writer describing the season as the \\"worst year ever\\". The first storm of series of storms to affect Hawaii, Hurricane Ignacio produced to waves along south-facing beaches. However, rainfall from Ignacio was light. The second storm to affect the state, Tropical Storm Linda dropped heavy rainfall along the windward slopes of the island chain. In early September, Hurricane Pauline came close enough to require a hurricane watch, but the watch was discontinued when Pauline veered north. However, the storm did produced high waves, with amplitudes of to on the eastern side of Puna and Kau. Days later, Hurricane Rick generated high waves; however, the waves were not nearly as high as they were during Pauline. The final storm to affect Hawaii was Hurricane Nele. Due to fears of a repeat from Hurricane Iwa, which struck during the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, a hurricane watch was issued. Although the watch was discontinued when Nele veered west, it later re-curved and struck the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, giving boats a rough night. The only storm to make landfall during the year was Hurricane Waldo. Waldo destroyed hundreds of homes in Sinaloa and later produced significant rainfall across the Southwestern United States and Great Plains. One person was killed in Kansas. In addition, two storms affected California. The first, Tropical Storm Guillermo, helped firefighters put out fires during mid-July. The second, Tropical Storm Nora, brought light rainfall to the northern portion of the state in late August. Systems =Tropical Storm Andres= On June 1, an area of thunderstorms south of Acapulco developed. It increased in size and, by June 5, was organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly after thereafter. While the Monthly Weather Review reported that Tropical Storm Andres operationally started out as a tropical depression. the HURDAT database does not give Andres an initial depression stage. Andres headed west, and two days after formation, it reached its maximum intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) while located south of the Baja California Peninsula. It then slowly weakened as it moved around a weak upper- level high. It weakened to a depression on June 8. The low stayed a depression as it continued west until it dissipated on June 12 as the cyclone gradually increased in speed.Gunther & Cross 1935-6 =Hurricane Blanca= Blanca originated from a tropical disturbance south of Nicaragua. A tropical depression formed on June 6 south of the Mexican coast. Shortly thereafter, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Blanca. By June 8, the EPHC reported that Blanca had intensified into a hurricane. Blanca fluctuated in intensity for several days, but Blanca did not intensify into a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher, until June 13\\\\. After reaching its peak intensity that day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) later that day, Hurricane Blanca began to weaken. It held on to hurricane strength until June 14, when the agency reported that Hurricane Blanca had fallen to tropical storm intensity. Steadily weakening, Blanca deteriorated into a tropical depression, before dissipating on June 16. As a precaution, maritime operations were closed in the western states of Colima, Guerrero and Michoacan. Travel on the high seas and along the coast was also restricted. =Tropical Storm Carlos= Carlos originated from a tropical disturbance moving that was moving westward along the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The wave developed into the third tropical cyclone of the season at 1800 UTC on June 7\\\\. Due to weak steering currents, the depression moved north and then south, which subsequently resulted in a very small cyclonic loop. By 0000 UTC on June 10, the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm Carlos; at the time, the storm also attained its maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). However, six hours later, Carlos weakened back to a tropical depression. Thereafter, the storm accelerated somewhat, and quickly merging with the remnants of Tropical Storm Andres at 1800 UTC on June 10. =Hurricane Dolores= A disturbance located south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec moved westward along 10¬∞N between June 24 and June 25\\\\. After interacting with an upper trough, the disturbance strengthened, and by the following day, it developed into the fourth tropical depression of the season at 0600 UTC. The depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores late on June 27\\\\. Dolores strengthened further while tracking west-northwestward around the southern end of a deep layer ridge. By 1800 UTC on June 28, the storm had reached hurricane intensity. Thereafter, Dolores continued to steadily deepen, and by 0600 UTC on July 1, the storm peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane. However, due to colder sea surface temperatures and increasing vertical wind shear, Dolores quickly weakened, and by early on July 2, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm further weakened to a tropical depression. At around 1800 UTC on July 5, Dolores dissipated. =Tropical Storm Enrique= Enrique began as a tropical disturbance in the ITCZ west of the larger and very intense Hurricane Dolores. Moving west over water, the system was designated as a tropical depression on June 27\\\\. Shortly thereafter, it intensified Tropical Storm Enrique. Turning west-northwest, the storm moved over slightly warmer water. Despite this, Enrique never strengthened beyond 40 mph (65 km/h) winds, and entered the CPHC's warming responsibility on July 1\\\\. Turning west beneath a ridge, Enrique rapidly weakened to tropical depression status. On July 4, the shallow and weak system turned slightly south of west. Enrique had dissipated by July 5\\\\. Despite its weak intensity, moisture carried by the system caused a few localized heavy showers on the windward side of the Big Island of Hawaii on July 5 and over the Kona slopes throughout the night hours of July 5 and 6. =Tropical Storm Fefa= A tropical disturbance moved westward across the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 1\\\\. At 1200 UTC on the following day, the disturbance was classified as Tropical Depression Six, while centered about south of Acapulco. Early on July 3, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fefa, while moving parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico. Fefa approached hurricane status and peaked as a 70 mph (110 km/h) tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 4\\\\. However, thereafter, the storm began weakening as a short-wave trough in the westerlies moved into northern Mexico, which caused increased wind shear on Tropical Storm Fefa. Additionally, colder sea surface temperatures over the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula further weakened Fefa. By 1800 UTC on July 6, Fefa dissipated. At the time of dissipation, the low while located about east of La Paz. =Tropical Storm Guillermo= The origins of Guillermo were from a tropical disturbance that formed within south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving rapidly west-northwest over moderately warm water, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was centered south of Acapulco on July 7\\\\. Roughly 24 hours later, the storm intensified slightly, enough to warrant an upgraded into Tropical Storm Guillermo. Tropical Storm Guillermo moved northwest at almost around the southwest side of a high pressure area over Central Mexico. Passing north of Socorro Island, Guillermo attained its maximum intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) during the evening of July 9. Shortly after its peak, Guillermo began to weaken rapidly due to a combination of strong wind shear and waters. By 1800 UTC, most of the thunderstorm activity had dissipated and only a weak low-pressure area remained. Based on this, Guillermo was downgraded into a tropical depression. Finally, Guillermo turned west and ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone on July 12. The remnants of the storm brought light rainfall to the mountains and valleys of California, helping re-fill dry reservoirs and put out large fires. =Tropical Storm Hilda= Tropical Depression Nine developed at 0000 UTC on July 18\\\\. Initially, the depression tracked northward due to weak southerly flow associated with an upper-level high centered near the southern tip of Baja California Sur. By 0000 UTC on July 19, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilda; the storm reached its maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) at this time. Thereafter, Hilda turned westward. Due to sea surface temperatures of only , Hilda began to weaken and it dissipated on 1200 UTC July 20. =Hurricane Jimena= Jimena originated from a tropical wave that moved across Central America and southern Mexico on July 18 and 19\\\\. Located along the northern edge of the ITCZ, a tropical depression formed by July 20. Initially moving west, the depression turned west-northwest and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Jimena early on July 21\\\\. Jimena attained hurricane intensity two days later. Hurricane Jimena remained a Category 1 hurricane for roughly another day, only to undergo a burst of intensification despite being above marginally warm ocean temperatures. The storm attained peak wind speed of 130 mph (215 km/h) while located roughly southwest of Cabo San Lucas. After maintaining peak intensity for 12 hours, Jimena turned northwest, and respectively began a slow decline. Jimena fell below hurricane status on 1800 UTC July 26\\\\. Tropical Storm Jimena was downgraded into a tropical depression late on July 27\\\\. Jimena was no longer considered a tropical cyclone by July 29, as its center had dissipated over fairly cold water. =Hurricane Ignacio= A tropical depression was spotted early on July 21 while located southwest of San Diego. Situated over warm waters, the depression attained tropical storm intensity a couple hours later. Ignacio reached winds of 70 mph (140 km/h) on July 22, roughly 24 hours after formation, and subsequently entered the CPHC's warning zone. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Ignacio at daybreak on July 22, and thus upgraded Ignacio into hurricane status. Continuing to rapidly intensify, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft discovered that Hurricane Ignacio had reached its peak wind speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of . Operationally, Ignacio was believed to have peaked as a Category 5 hurricane. Shortly after its peak, the environment was rapidly becoming less conductive. By the evening on July 24, Ignacio was no longer a major hurricane. The hurricane resumed its westerly course, and Ignacio was re-assessed as a tropical storm on July 26\\\\. Passing south of the island chain, Ignacio dissipated on July 27. On July 24, a high surf advisory was issued for east-facing shores of Hawaii; subsequently, a hurricane watch was issued the next day for the Big Island. Roughly 24 hours after the watch was issued, it was cancelled though a small craft advisory remained in effect for the Hawaiian Islands. Ignacio resulted in to surf, peaking midday on July 25\\\\. Rainfall from the storm was generally light though many secondary roads that lead to the beaches were closed. =Tropical Storm Kevin= A tropical wave crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 27 and developed into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 29\\\\. While tracking west-northwestward between , the depression slowly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kevin at 1800 UTC on July 31\\\\. Crossing marginally warm sea surface temperatures, Kevin maintained tropical storm intensity while tracking westward. However, by August 5, vertical wind shear began increasing, which was generated by an upper-level trough. As a result, Kevin weakened to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on August 6 and dissipated 12 hours later. =Tropical Storm Linda= A tropical wave formed on July 28 over fairly warm water. Moving west-northwest, the system was declared a tropical depression far from land the next day. It became Tropical Storm Linda later on July 29\\\\. A relatively weak cyclone, Linda peaked as a moderate tropical storm at 1200 UTC on July 31\\\\. Shortly after its peak, Tropical Storm Linda began to weaken over cooler waters and increased wind shear. Linda began to weaken and was downgraded into a tropical depression on August 2\\\\. Two days later, it passed into the CPHC's area of responsibility. Upon entering the warning zone, the tropical depression was moving slowly toward the northwest and within six hours, Tropical Depression Linda began to re-intensify. On August 4, the storm had regained tropical storm status. Subsequently, Linda reaches its secondary peak with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Linda remained a tropical storm for about 24 hours before it started to weaken again on August 5\\\\. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day. Meanwhile, Linda turned west under the influence of northerly trade winds. The depression came within of South Point, Hawaii, before dissipating early on August 9\\\\. Some heavy showers associated with the outer rainband's of the low fell on the windward slopes of the Big Island of Hawaii and Maui, where rainfall totals of were recorded. =Hurricane Marty= A tropical disturbance crossed the coast of El Salvador and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 3\\\\. After moving westward over sea surface temperatures of , the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1800 UTC on August 6, while centered about southwest of Acapulco. While tracking west-northwestward at about , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Marty at 1200 UTC August 7\\\\. Further strengthening occurred and Marty became a hurricane on 0000 UTC August 9\\\\. However, after 18 hours as a hurricane, Marty weakened back to a tropical storm as it began tracking across colder sea surface temperatures. Early on August 13, Marty weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated later that day at 1800 UTC. =Tropical Storm Nora= A tropical disturbance detached from the ITCZ on August 18\\\\. While tracking across an area of sea surface temperatures of , the disturbance slowly intensified and the EPHC reported that the system had developed tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 19\\\\. Initially, the depression remained weak, though by 1200 UTC on August 21, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nora. Thereafter, Nora turned northwestward toward a deep-layer low pressure area offshore of California. During this time, the storm began to weaken due to a decrease in sea surface temperatures. Nora weakened back to a tropical depression on August 22\\\\. Nora began to dissipate at 1200 UTC August 23 over waters. Meanwhile, low-level clouds began to enter the storm's circulation. The high-level outflow associated with the storm moved northward and then eastward, resulting in light rainfall in Northern California on August 22 and 23. =Hurricane Olaf= Olaf originated from a disturbed south of Acapulco on August 21 over extremely warm waters. Moving slowly west, the EPHC reported that a tropical depression formed on August 22\\\\. The depression attained tropical storm status the next day, and subsequently began to rapidly intensify. While turning northwest, Olaf became a hurricane south-southwest of La Paz. It headed west-northwest, and reached its peak intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane late on August 26, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Hurricane Olaf then moved slowing towards the west beneath a ridge and into progressively cooler waters. Olaf weakened into a tropical storm on August 28, and then degenerated into a tropical depression the next afternoon. Tropical Depression Olaf suddenly turned north towards an upper-level through off the U.S. West Coast. However, hostile conditions caused the system to cease to exist as a tropical cyclone early on August 31 several hundred miles west- southwest of San Diego, California. =Hurricane Pauline= A small, westward moving area of thunderstorm activity become the 17th cyclone of the season. Turning southwest between an upper-level high over Baja California and a low near the southern coast of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pauline. Over the next couple of day, the cyclone turned west, and then west-northwest. Slowly strengthening despite underneath warm waters, Pauline attained hurricane intensity on September 7\\\\. Subsequently, Pauline turned towards the south. After peaking in intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, the system crossed into the CPHC's area of responsibility. It remained at hurricane intensity for three days. Shortly thereafter, Pauline began to weaken and turn northwest away from Hawaii. Due to interaction with trough, the hurricane veered north into an environment of strong wind shear. The result was rapid weakening; Hurricane Pauline was downgraded to a tropical storm late on September 8 and a tropical depression well north of the islands the next day. Pauline ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone by the evening hours of September 9\\\\. However, the remnants of Pauline moved northwest into an area of low pressure of the Gulf of Alaska. A recognizable circulation in the low level flow was visible for several days as it drifted westward far to the north of the Hawaiian Islands. Hurricane Pauline threatened the islands enough to prompt the issuance of a hurricane watch on September 6\\\\. Around this time, officials drew plans to evacuate coastal residents and 100,000 people were asked to make emergency preparations. Instead, Pauline turned away from the islands and the watch was cancelled. However, Pauline did cause high surf along the east facing shores of all the Islands. up to surf was measured along the Big Island, Puna, and Kau coastlines. As a result, some roads were temporarily closed due to washed debris. =Tropical Storm Skip= The origins of Skip were from a disturbance that passed well south of Hawaii in late August. The CPHC monitored the disturbance for several days and was classified as Tropical Depression Two-C on August 30\\\\. Two-C crossed the International dateline the next day and into the western Pacific. Initially moving west, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Skip at 0900 UTC September 9\\\\. A Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough then steered tip to the north and later towards the northeast. It underwent two strengthened phases. Skip reached typhoon intensity on two occasions, the first on September 1 and the second on September 7\\\\. The system subsequently recrossed the dateline as Skip was rapidly weakening and gaining extratropical features. Shortly thereafter, Skip was declared extratropical despite still producing hurricane-force winds. The typhoon briefly threatened Wake Island. =Hurricane Rick= A tropical wave that moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into Tropical Depression Eighteen on 0000 UTC September 1\\\\. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September 2\\\\. Initially, further intensification was slow; the storm did not attain hurricane status until the low was located away from land. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category 4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h). Operationally, it was believed to be much stronger, with winds of 170 mph (275 km/h), equivalent to Category 5 strength. Following a path similar to the one Pauline made a few days earlier, the powerful hurricane moved northwest. A weakening trend commenced on September 10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate. On September 11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with the same trough though weak low-level circulation persisted for several more days. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path and meteorologists noted the potential to be more of a threat to Hawaii than Pauline. The hurricane approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north sooner than Pauline, the surf did rise somewhat. =Hurricane Sandra= During the late evening of September 4, a large intense area of thunderstorm activity formed near the Guatemala-El Salvador coast. The thunderstorm developed a circulation about 24 hours later, and was thus upgraded into a tropical depression a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast. Turning west-northwest over waters, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Sandra early on September 7\\\\. By 0600 UTC September 8, winds had increased to 75 mph (120 km/h), and Sandra was upgraded into a hurricane. Sandra turned west, and quickly intensified, reaching Category 3 status later that day after bypassing the Category 2 stage. On 0000 UTC September 9, Sandra peaked in intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). After moving towards the west for an additional 18 hours, it subsequently began a sharp turn northwest and later west-northwest due to an intensifying trough off the west coast of Baja California. Meanwhile, Sandra slowly weakened. At 1746 UTC September 12, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft intersected Hurricane Sandra after being on standby in Hawaii. The aircraft penetrated Sandra twice, reaching the level. It also measured surface winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a surface pressure of . The eye was reportedly open to the west with low-level banding, and the eye was in diameter. Shortly after the flight, the cyclone then began to turn to the west and weaken further over waters. Sandra was downgraded into a tropical storm the next day; however, the storm briefly regained minimal hurricane status. On 1800 UTC September 14, Sandra weakened back into a tropical storm roughly west of the Baja California Peninsula. Now over sea surface temperatures, Sandra weakened into a tropical depression on September 15 and dissipated two days later. =Hurricane Terry= A tropical wave moved through Nicaragua on September 14\\\\. Moving rapidly west over warms, a circulation became evident and tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC September 15, the twentieth of the season. The system turned northwest; subsequently, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Terry 24 hours after formation approximately south of Acapulco. Early on September 17, Terry attained hurricane status. Terry quickly reached Category 2 status and briefly reached Category 3 intensity, peaking with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on September 21 over south of Cabo San Lucas. Shortly after its peak, a cold trough moved southward into Baja California Norte. This steered Hurricane Terry northward into cooler waters. A U.S. Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft investigated the weakening Terry on 1800 UTC September 21 and 22 while the storm was west-southwest of the peninsula. Two penetrations were made in both flights. The second flight suggested that the hurricane had a poorly defined eye. A combination of cooler water and increased wind shear took its toll on Terry. The system weakened into a tropical storm at 0600 UTC September 23 due west of the Baja California Peninsula, and a tropical depression early the following day. By 1800 UTC, Terry dissipated while its center dissipated west-southwest of San Diego. The hurricane at one point in time was predicted to make landfall in central Baja California and threaten San Diego; however, this did not occur. =Tropical Storm Vivian= A disturbance emerged from the northern ITCZ on September 17\\\\. By 0600 UTC on the following day, it developed into a tropical depression. Initially, the depression tracked northwestward in response to a strong upper- level trough centered over northern Baja California. After crossing an area of sea surface temperatures in excess of , the depression was able to strengthen into Tropical Storm Vivian at 0000 UTC on September 20\\\\. Under the influence of Hurricane Terry and an upper-level high pressure, Vivian turned west, southwest, and eventually southward. While tracking to the south, the storm re-entered the ITCZ, which caused Vivian to weaken and become indistinguishable. Vivian was downgraded to a tropical depression on September 21, shortly before dissipating on 1800 UTC on that same day. =Hurricane Waldo= Tropical Depression Twenty-Three formed from a disturbance on October 7\\\\. In a favorable environment over warm waters, It rapidly intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity the same day it formed. Tropical Storm Waldo then began to turn to the north and while located south of Baja California Sur, Waldo was upgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. A trough started re- curving Waldo towards the Mexican coast. Shortly after peaking as a Category 2 hurricane, Waldo made landfall southwest of Culiac√°n. Waldo rapidly dissipated over land and eventually merged with a cold front. Prior to the arrival of Waldo, the Mexican Army was put on standby in the event the Fuerte River flooded. While no deaths or injuries were reported, much farmland and 600 houses were destroyed. The Juarez River bursts its banks, flooding at least eight neighborhoods in Culiac√°n. Telephone service in Los Mochis, Guarmuchil, and Guasave was cut when a communications tower was blown over. A total of 10,000 people were left homeless across the state. In combination with a cold front, Waldo contributed to major flooding in Kansas that forced many rivers and creeks to overflow their banks. One indirect death was reported and roughly 15 people were evacuated from their homes in one town. In Kansas City, Waldo produced of water on roads, but none of the nearby homes received extensive damage. The Sedgwick County, the county fire department freed 35 trapped people from rising flood waters. Flash floods affected the southern one-third of New Mexico from rainfall associated from Waldo. Damage was estimated between $100,000-$1 million (1985 USD), mostly to crops, roads, and buildings. In all, Waldo's rain was comparable to Atlantic Hurricane Gloria. =Hurricane Nele= The origins of Nele were from a tropical disturbance to the south-southeast of Hawaii on October 20\\\\. The tropical disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-C while located south-southeast of Hawaii on October 23\\\\. Although difficult to observe on satellite imagery, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Nele early on October 24\\\\. Continuing to intensify, the storm tracked northwestward, following a similar path to Hurricane Iwa in 1982 and Hurricane Nina in 1957. On October 25, Nele attained hurricane strength as it turned to the north. On October 26 it attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). It entered an area of weaker steering currents due to a nearby trough. This caused concern for the CPHC, who noted that a continued path would result in the hurricane moving through the island chain. Instead, Nele turned to the northwest at a steady pace and instead moved through the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, passing about west of French Frigate Shoals and very near Tern Island. Around that time, reconnaissance aircraft measured winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a pressure of . After passing through the island chain, the storm finally weakened and accelerated towards the north. Nele re-curved to the northeast, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 30. Due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, a hurricane watch was issued for Hawaii. Officials moved beach equipment away from the beach in preparation. About 24 hours after the hurricane watch was issued, it was dropped as Nele moved away from the islands, alongside the cancellation of a high surf advisory. The hurricane produced waves along south-facing beaches. Upon passing through the Leeward Islands, a weather station on Tern Island recorded winds of with gusts of , along with a pressure of . Many fishing boats spent a tough night at French Frigate Shoals due to high waves and seas. One vessel was partially disabled due to a broken rudder and required assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard. Another vessel reported winds of hurricane-force and to . Other fishing vessels near Maro Reef and Laysan Island had an easier time as they were in the weaker left of the hurricane. =Hurricane Xina= Tropical Depression Twenty-Four developed at 0600 UTC on October 25, in the southwest quadrant of a quasi-stationary deep-layer mean anticyclone. The depression moved generally westward and slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Xina about 72 hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Thereafter, the storm curved northwestward and gradually intensified, and by late on October 28, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Xina then rapidly deepened, peaking as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane at 1800 UTC on October 29\\\\. However, due to decreasing sea surface temperatures, Xina almost immediately began to weaken. Shortly thereafter, the storm curved eastward, later followed by a south-southwestward turned early on October 31\\\\. Later that day, Xina was downgraded to a tropical storm. At around 0600 UTC on November 1, the storm had further weakened to a tropical depression. Xina briefly re-strengthened to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC on November 2, though it quickly weakened back to a tropical depression about six hours later. After weakening back to a tropical depression, the circulation of Xina became very disorganized and difficult to locate. Early on November 4, the depression curved southwestward, and by 0600 UTC on November 5, Xina had dissipated. =Tropical depressions= Of the four tropical cyclones that did not reach tropical storm strength, the first was a weak disturbance that began to develop in the northern Intertropical Convergence Zone on July 10\\\\. After convection increased and a circulation formed, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eight at 1800 UTC on July 11\\\\. However, deep convection quickly began to diminish, and by early on the following day, the depression dissipated. Tropical Depression Twenty-Five-E well away from land The only tropical depression to develop in the CPHC's area of responsibility developed from a disturbance embedded in the trade wind flow south of the Hawaiian Islands that was about south of the Hawaiian Islands. A tropical depression was declared on August 20 as the system appeared to be intensifying while moving rapidly west-northwest. However, increased wind shear from a trough, an elongated area of low pressure, took toll on the storm and it weakened on August 21 near the Johnston Atoll. Due to the lack of a well-defined atmospheric circulation, the storm ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone two days after formation. An area of convection within the ITCZ developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-Two at 0000 UTC on October 1\\\\. However, the depression never separated from the ITCZ. Despite sea surface temperatures in excess of , the depression did not strengthen, and on the following day, the center became ill-defined and difficult to locate on satellite imagery. Convection began decreasing, and as a result, the depression is estimated to have dissipated at 1800 UTC on October 2\\\\. Over a month later, a weak disturbance located about southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur developed a circulation; the system was promptly classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-Five at 0600 UTC on November 21\\\\. The depression drifted slowly southward at 3 mph (5 km/h), shortly before curving west-southwestward. Thereafter, the depression turned north-northwestward and dissipated later on November 21. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1985. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1991 season, although the name Dolores was misspelled as Delores in 1991. This is the same list used for the 1979 season, except for the added names. Storms were named Kevin, Linda, Marty, Nora, Olaf, Rick, Sandra, Terry, Vivian, Waldo, and Xina for the first time in 1985. The name Pauline was previously used in the 1961 and 1968 seasons respectively. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Andres * Blanca * Carlos * Dolores * Enrique * Fefa * Guillermo  * Hilda * Ignacio * Jimena * Kevin * Linda * Marty * Nora  * Olaf * Pauline * Rick * Sandra * Terry * Vivian * Waldo } Because of the level of activity, these names were added during the season: Later during the 80's, the added names were made a permanent part of the Eastern Pacific lists, and other names were added for even-numbered years, which were Xavier, Yolanda, and Zeke. All three names were first used in 1992, and Xavier was used a second time in 2018. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Xina  *  * } One name from the Central Pacific list was used - Nele.

His first training was from his father . He went to the Vienna Academy in 1738, but his artistic inheritance is really from the great Viennese sculptor Georg Raphael Donner (1693‚Äì1741). He taught at the Vienna Academy from 1751 to 1754. One of his pupils at the Vienna Academy was Franz Xaver Messerschmidt (1736‚Äì1783). His later work possesses classical character. In 1739 he decorated the pulpit of the Church of the Servites in Vienna with monumental figures, representing the virtues of Faith, Love and Hope. The statuettes in walnut and stained ivory, now on display in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, served as model for the pulpit, and show already his virtuosity. He made a funeral monument for general count Leopold Daun (died 1766) at the wall of the George chapel in the Augustinian church in Vienna. He was used initially at the Viennese court for the design and manufacture of floats and showy sledges. He was soon to become the leading sculptor in the Late Baroque art of courtly representation. His work in Vienna includes about twenty tombs of the Habsburg imperial family in the Imperial Crypt, especially his masterpiece, the elaborate double sarcophagus in Rococo style of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband Emperor Franz I Stephan on which Moll worked from 1751 to 1772. The life-size imperial pair lie on the tin lid, awakened from their sleep of death by the Trumps of Doom. The two look at each other while a putto behind them holds a garland of stars above them. The reliefs on the sides of the sarcophagus depict important scenes of their lives : the ceremonial entrance in Florence as archduke of Tuscany, his coronation in Frankfurt am Main, his coronation in Prague as King of Bohemia, and the coronation ceremony in Bratislava of Maria Theresia. Of the four corners of the sarcophagus, grieving statues show the crowns and blasons of their most important titles : Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Bohemia and Jerusalem. Sarcophagus of emperor Karl VI (detail with the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire) He also worked on the sarcophagi of emperor Karl VI (with the famous skull with the crown of the Holy Roman Empire), his wife the empress Elisabeth Christine, and emperor Joseph I. He decorated numerous Austrian churches, palaces and castles with statues, bas-reliefs and crucifixes. He also participated at the decoration with statues of the Triumphal Arch for Emperor Leopold II at Innsbruck. He produced the 1781 equestrian statues of that emperor Franz II that stands in the Burggarten and of field marshal Joseph Wenzel F√ºrst Liechtenstein. The marble statue of emperor Franz Stephan von Lotharingen in the Belvedere is also attributed to him. He is also the sculptor of some gravestones in the Stephansdom cathedral.

Early years  Cone's father was a prospector and a mining engineer. His mother, Isabelle Fairfax Williams (1869‚Äì1940), was a schoolteacher in San Francisco. In 1921 Cone enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, originally intending to be an illustrator. Eventually he graduated with a degree in English. Due to a problem with his credentials, Cone got a job as an advertising clerk with the San Francisco Examiner rather than a teaching fellowship. In 1928, Cone left the paper for an advertising agency, thus embarking on a career that would leave an indelible mark on his life.  Advertising career  After a year with the L.H. Waldron advertising agency, Cone joined Lord and Thomas as a copywriter. Despite health problems stemming from an over-active pancreas, Cone steadily rose up the corporate ladder, eventually impressing the head of the firm, Albert Lasker. In 1941, Lasker wished to retire and liquidate Lord and Thomas, but he passed of the bulk of the agency's clients to three of his rising stars; Emerson Foote, Don Belding, and Cone. On December 29, 1942, the three opened a new agency, Foote, Cone and Belding. Following the retirements of Foote and Belding (whose positions were subsequently filled by others), Cone became the last of the three founders on the Board of Directors, a position he retained until 1975. In 1946, he became the director of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. He is sometimes called the \\"father of modern advertising\\" and is a member of the American National Business Hall of Fame. He died in Monterey, California.  Quotations  * Advertising is what you do when you can't go see somebody. That's all it is. * There is no such thing as a Mass Mind. The Mass Audience is made up of individuals, and good advertising is written always from one person to another. When it is aimed at millions it rarely moves anyone. * The inventory goes down the elevator every night.

The area is renowned for its beautiful tropical islands, excellent diving and snorkelling, coral reefs and WWII wrecks, ecotourism lodges, and head-hunting shrines. The province contains many small lagoons and most of the country's tourist trade outside Honiara. History The Methodist Mission in the Western Province was established by Rev. John Frances Goldie in 1902. He dominated the mission and gained the loyalty of Solomon Islander members of his church. The relationship with the colonial administrators of the British Solomon Island Protectorate were also fraught with difficulty, at this time due to Goldie's effective control over the Western Solomon Islands. From 1927 to 1934 Dr Edward Sayers worked at the Methodist mission where he established a hospital at Gizo, and also at Munda and Vella Lavella, and carried out fieldwork in the treatment of malaria.Sayers, E. G. (1943) Malaria in the South Pacific with Special Reference to the Solomon Islands. New Zealand Government Printing Office It is also renowned as where the American Navy ship commanded by John F. Kennedy was bombed and sunk by the Japanese during the Second World War. Tourism The provincial capital is Gizo, a town of around 3000. There are airports at Gizo, Munda, Seghe, Viru, Ramata, Gatokae, Ringgi Cove, Barakoma & Balalai. The Western Province is considered the tourism mecca of the Solomon Islands, and is by far the most accommodating area, with multiple hotels and resorts, dive shops, ecotourism attractions restaurants, and boat tours. Munda, the largest town on New Georgia island, has a landing strip built during WWII by the US and is listed as an emergency landing runway, capable of handling even jumbo jets. The diving in the Western Province is pristine as tourists tend to visit nearby Fiji for diving rather than visiting the less developed Solomon Islands. Also, malaria is a concern in the Solomons, which keeps many tourists away. The result is spectacular dive conditions with untouched coral reefs. Munda, Uepi, and Gizo are considered some of the Western Province's best dive locations. The region supports some of the highest coral and fish diversity in the world. The Western Province and nearby Choiseul Province were significantly affected by 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake, an 8.1 magnitude earthquake that struck on April 2, 2007 and an associated tsunami. It caused 100+ significant (in excess of magnitude 4.0) aftershocks. The official death toll was 52 with several thousand persons displaced, most of the displaced are expected to be living in temporary shelters for a minimum of between 6 and 9 months. The island of Ranongga to the west of Gizo was uplifted by around 2.5 ‚Äì 3 metres resulting in the death of its fringing reef and also opening massive fissures in the island itself. Reefs around Munda and Uepi were largely unaffected by the tsunami and earthquake.

It was a very active Pacific hurricane season. The season started on May 15, 1983 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1983 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. During the 1983 season, there were 21 named storms, which was slightly less than the previous season. Furthermore, twelve of those storms became hurricanes. And eight of the storms reached major hurricane status, or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The decaying 1982‚Äì83 El Ni√±o event likely contributed to this level of activity. That same El Ni√±o influenced a very quiet Atlantic hurricane season. The first storm of the season, Hurricane Adolph became the southernmost-forming east Pacific tropical cyclone on record after forming at a latitude of 7.1¬∞N. After a slow start, activity picked up in July, when Hurricane Gil moved through the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in moderate damage. In early August, Hurricane Ismael was responsible for three deaths and $19 million (1983 USD) in damage. During early September, Hurricanes Kiko and Lorena brought significant damage and seven deaths to southern Mexico. About a month later, Tropical Storm Octave became the worst tropical cyclone on record to affect Arizona. Octave killed 15 people, and caused $500 million in damage to Arizona and $12.5 million to New Mexico. Later in October, Hurricane Tico was a very intense hurricane at the time of its landfall and thus left 25,000 homeless. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $200 million while 135 deaths were reported in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants brought significant flooding in the Central United States, resulting in six deaths and $42 million in damage. A few days later, Hurricane Raymond posed a threat to Hawaii, but did little actual damage. The final storm of the season, Hurricane Winnie, was a rare December cyclone. __TOC__ Seasonal summary ImageSize = width:800 height:205 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1983 till:01/01/1984 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1983 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:21/05/1983 till:28/05/1983 color:C2 text:\\"Adolph (C2)\\" from:09/06/1983 till:18/06/1983 color:C4 text:\\"Barbara (C4)\\" from:02/07/1983 till:05/07/1983 color:TS text:\\"Cosme (TS)\\" from:05/07/1983 till:12/07/1983 color:TS text:\\"Dalila (TS)\\" from:12/07/1983 till:16/07/1983 color:TS text:\\"Erick (TS)\\" from:17/07/1983 till:21/07/1983 color:TS text:\\"Flossie (TS)\\" from:23/07/1983 till:05/08/1983 color:C1 text:\\"Gil (C1)\\" barset:break from:27/07/1983 till:06/08/1983 color:C4 text:\\"Henriette (C4)\\" from:03/08/1983 till:07/08/1983 color:TD text:\\"Nine (TD)\\" from:08/08/1983 till:14/08/1983 color:C2 text:\\"Ismael (C2)\\" from:15/08/1983 till:16/08/1983 color:TD text:\\"Eleven (TD)\\" from:19/08/1983 till:20/08/1983 color:TD text:\\"One-C (TD)\\" from:24/08/1983 till:01/09/1983 color:TS text:\\"Juliette (TS)\\" from:31/08/1983 till:01/09/1983 color:TD text:\\"Two-C (TD)\\" barset:break from:31/08/1983 till:09/09/1983 color:C4 text:\\"Kiko (C4)\\" from:06/09/1983 till:14/09/1983 color:C3 text:\\"Lorena (C3)\\" from:12/09/1983 till:20/09/1983 color:C3 text:\\"Manuel (C3)\\" from:21/09/1983 till:01/10/1983 color:TS text:\\"Narda (TS)\\" from:27/09/1983 till:02/10/1983 color:TS text:\\"Octave (TS)\\" from:30/09/1983 till:07/10/1983 color:C3 text:\\"Priscilla (C3)\\" from:08/10/1983 till:20/10/1983 color:C4 text:\\"Raymond (C4)\\" barset:break from:09/10/1983 till:14/10/1983 color:TS text:\\"Sonia (TS)\\" from:11/10/1983 till:19/10/1983 color:C4 text:\\"Tico (C4)\\" from:18/10/1983 till:18/10/1983 color:TD text:\\"Twentytwo (TD)\\" from:01/11/1983 till:03/11/1983 color:TS text:\\"Velma (TS)\\" from:04/12/1983 till:07/12/1983 color:C1 text:\\"Winnie (C1)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0, -20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/1983 till:01/06/1983 text:May from:01/06/1983 till:01/07/1983 text:June from:01/07/1983 till:01/08/1983 text:July from:01/08/1983 till:01/09/1983 text:August from:01/09/1983 till:01/10/1983 text:September from:01/10/1983 till:01/11/1983 text:October from:01/11/1983 till:01/12/1983 text:November from:01/12/1983 till:01/01/1984 text:December TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" During the 1983 season, a total of 21 named storms formed, which was well-above the long-term average of 15. However, this total was slightly less active than the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, which saw a then-record 22 storms form. However, 1983 was at that time the most active season in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) warning zone, but this record itself was surpassed during the 1985 Pacific hurricane season, and again in the 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Additionally, 12 storms reached hurricane intensity, which was above the average of eight. Of the 12 hurricanes, eight attained Category 3 intensity or higher on the SSHWS. The season started on May 21 with the formation of Adolph and ended on December 9, with the dissipation of Hurricane Winnie. Lasting 201 days, 1983 was the longest season on record. There were a total of 1,238 storm hours, which was the most in four years. Despite the activity in the EPHC's warning responsibility, only two storms formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility, both of which stayed depressions. A moderate El Ni√±o was present throughout the season, with water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific was nearly 5 ¬∞F (0.6 ¬∞C) above normal. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period. Both of these factors are known to enhance Pacific hurricane season activity. Furthermore, 1983 was in the middle of an era where all but the 1988 Pacific hurricane season was near or above average. One storm in 1983 formed in May, an event the occurs every other year on average. Another storm formed in June, which was below the average of 1.7 storms per June. Despite a somewhat slow start, activity picked up in July, where 6 storms formed. This was twice the average, though only two of the storm thus far had exceeded hurricane intensity. Although August was less active, with only 3 storms developing, compared to the average of 4, two of the storms that formed in July lasted into the early part of the month. However, activity picked back up again in September, with 5 storms forming, which was above the average of 3. Three storms also formed in October, which was two storms above normal. One storm developed in November as well, a somewhat unusual occurrence. For the first time since 1947, a hurricane developed in December. Three storms during the season made landfall on Mexico. The first, Adolph did so in May. The second, Tico, hit near Mazatl√°n as a powerful hurricane, resulting in severe damage. Around this time, a weak tropical depression made landfall along the western portion of the nation as well. In addition, Tropical Depression Raymond made landfall on Hawaii in late October. Hurricane Hunters flew into 2 storms within the EPHC zone (Manuel and Ismael). Moreover, they flew into 3 storms in CPHC's area of responsibility, Tropical Storms Gil and Narda, and Hurricane Raymond. Systems =Hurricane Adolph= On May 21, a tropical depression formed southwest of Managua, at a latitude of 7.1¬∞N, becoming the southernmost-forming tropical cyclone in the east Pacific basin. As the depression headed gradually west-northwestward over extremely warm sea surface temperatures, it steadily intensified. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adolph. Further intensification occurred as Adolph headed west-northwestward; by May 24, the EPHC reported that Adolph had strengthened into a hurricane, setting a then- record for the earliest known hurricane in the basin, though this was later surpassed by Hurricane Alma in May 1990. Shortly thereafter, the storm turned northwestward and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the SSHWS. Around that time, Adolph attained its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) as the storm briefly developed a well-defined eye. At that time, Adolph was the strongest May hurricane on record. However, this record was broken by a hurricane in 2001 that was also named Adolph. Following peak intensity, Adolph gradually weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. By May 25, Adolph curved sharply north-northeastward, as a result of being steered by anticyclonic deep-layer mean. Despite being situated over fairly warm waters, Adolph weakened considerably due to increased wind shear. Although the EPHC expected the storm to stay at sea, Adolph curved north-northeastward. It was then downgraded to a tropical storm on May 25\\\\. Rapidly weakening, Tropical Storm Adolph moved onshore near Puerto Vallarta early the next day. After briefly moving offshore, it again made landfall near Mazatl√°n at 0800 UTC that day. Adolph soon dissipated over land, becoming the first of two storms to strike the Pacific coast of Mexico during the season. Because Hurricane Adolph weakened significantly prior to landfall, no deaths or major damage occurred. However, the remnants of the storm brought heavy showers and gusty winds to Florida. Although a modern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15, one newspaper considered Adolph a \\"pre-season\\" storm. =Hurricane Barbara= A tropical disturbance was first observed in early June about south of Guatemala, and headed westward. The tropical disturbance intensified, and became the second tropical depression of the season on June 9\\\\. After staying a tropical depression for 24 hours, the system was subsequently upgraded to Tropical Storm Barbara. Initially, Barbara was expected to come very close to the Mexican coast; however, this failed to happen. At first, Tropical Storm Barbara moved west-northwest, though on June 11, the cyclone turned west- northwest while gradually gaining intensity. At 1800 UTC on June 12, Barbara was estimated to have attained hurricane status while centered north of Clipperton Island. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, rapid deepening commenced, and by early the next morning, the hurricane was a high-end Category 1. Six hours later, Barbara skipped Category 2 status, and became a major hurricane. At 1800 UTC on June 13, Hurricane Barbara was upgraded into a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS while its peak strength of 135 mph (215 km/h). At peak, Barbara had a \\"fantastic eye\\". Hurricane Barbara held on to peak intensity for a day. Thereafter, Barbara slowly weakened after peak intensity as it began to encounter cooler water temperatures, while moving slowly northward around the western edge of a high pressure area over central Mexico. By the early morning hours of June 16, the hurricane was positioned west-southwest of Socorro Island and about west of the coast of Mexico. Later that day, Barbara weakened into a tropical storm due to strong wind shear. Barbara was downgraded to a tropical depression early on June 17\\\\. Further weakening persisted, and Barbara dissipated on June 18. At the time of dissipation, the system was situated several hundred miles west-southwest of the Baja California peninsula. =Tropical Storm Cosme= A westward-moving low-latitude tropical disturbance was declared a tropical depression early on July 2\\\\. After making a turn northwest, the depression maintained its intensity for 42 hours. By 1200 UTC on July 4, the system was finally upgraded into a tropical storm after convection increased in coverage. However, Cosme failed to intensify further, and after encountering cooler waters, the storm rapidly dissipated. The EPHC declared Cosme dissipated at 1800 UTC on July 5. =Tropical Storm Dalilia= An intense area of thunderstorms developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 4. The system was first classified as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on July 5 roughly south-southeast of Acapulco. Turning west-northwest and then northwest while accelerating, the EPHC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Dalilia at 1800 UTC on July 6\\\\. Continuing to gain strength, Dalilia reached its peak intensity as a strong tropical storm early on July 8. After turning west the tropical storm started to lose strength while encountering colder water. At 0600 UTC on July 10, Tropical Storm Dalilia had been downgraded into a tropical depression. Two days later, the EPHC reported that the tropical cyclone had dissipated. =Tropical Storm Erick= Tropical Storm Erick originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on July 9 and July 10\\\\. At 0600 UTC on July 12, the EPHC reported that it had upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression. The depression moved steadily west-northwest under the influence of an anticyclone over the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The system gradually intensified over waters as warm as and at 0000 UTC on July 13, the agency upgraded the low into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Erick reached its peak intensity on July 14 as a high-end tropical storm. The storm maintained peak intensity for 24 hours, before encountering cooler water. Rapidly weakening, Erick dissipated on July 16 far from land. =Tropical Storm Flossie= A tropical disturbance developed southwest of Manzanillo late on July 16. Several hours later, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. Initially, the depression drifted southward, but at 1800 UTC on July 17, the system suddenly turned west-northwest and accelerated. The storm gradually intensified while passing northeast of Socorro Island. Midday on July 19, the tropical depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Flossie. Six hours later, Tropical Storm Flossie reached its peak wind speed of . While the storm approached the Baja California peninsula, the storm ultimately turned west into an area of cool water and high amounts of wind shear. By 0000 UTC on July 21, Flossie weakened into a tropical storm. Twelve hours later, Flossie ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone. =Hurricane Gil= The seventh tropical cyclone of the season developed during the afternoon hours of July 23 north of Clipperton Island. Thereafter, the EPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gil on July 24\\\\. Gil subsequently began to intensify; on 0000 UTC July 26, the storm was upgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. Early on July 27, the storm attained its peak intensity of . Despite turning west-northwest, Hurricane Gil maintained hurricane intensity until July 29 when the storm began to encounter cooler waters. Two days later, Gil was downgraded a tropical depression. After entering CPHC's warning zone on August 1, the CPHC Gil was re-upgraded into a tropical storm. Gil accelerated while approaching the Hawaiian Islands; on August 3, the tropical cyclone reached its secondary peak of . After passing through the Hawaiian islands, Gil passed very close to French Frigate Shoals on August 4 as a marginal tropical storm. Early on August 5, the system was downgraded into a tropical depression and degenerated into a trough about west-northwest of Tern Island later that day. Prior to arrival of Gil, gale warnings were issued for much of the islands, but on August 2, these warnings were discontinued for all islands except for Kauai. Jellyfish stung 50 tourists. On the northern part of the island, winds were reported, resulting in extensive damage in some areas, but slight damage to others. A minor power outage on the island briefly left 2,400 customers without electricity. In Maui, the outer rainbands of Gil led to minor flooding. Overall, damage from Gil was minimal and less than expected. Offshore, one person was presumed to have died when a catamaran, named Hurricane, went missing. Additionally, the 30-foot ship Adad nearly sunk in the storm and all three people on board sustained injuries. =Hurricane Henriette= A tropical disturbance developed about south of the Guatemala coastline. After developing a circulation, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression on July 27\\\\. Moving west- northwest, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Henriette at 1800 UTC that day. Henriette continued to deepen, and by late on July 28, the storm attained winds of . Although initially expected to pose a threat to Hawaii, this did not occur. It rapidly intensified, and late on July 28, the EPHC upgraded the storm into a hurricane. While turning west-southwest on a track similar to Gil's, it attained Category 2 intensity on July 29\\\\. At 0000 UTC on July 30, Henriette was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane. After leveling off in intensity, the storm passed within within Clipperton Island. Hurricane Henriette attained its peak intensity early on July 31, with winds of , a Category 4 system. At peak, Henriette displayed a well-defined eye. After continuing west-northwest for 12 hours, it then veered northwest and began to encounter cooler ocean temperatures. Henriette was slow to weaken, and by August 2, it was downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane. Two days later, Henriette was downgraded into a tropical storm. A strong trough of low pressure pulled Henriette northwest, and later north. On August 5, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression. The storm dissipated the next day at a high latitude, though the remnants of Henriette brought cloud cover to Oregon and Washington. =Tropical Depression Nine= On July 30 and 31, a tropical disturbance crossed Central America. At a low latitude, a tropical depression was declared on August 3. At first, the storm was expected to turn west-northwest, but it continued west instead. Nine failed to intensify despite being situated over warm water. The depression dissipated on August 7 later over somewhat cooler water. =Hurricane Ismael= The origins of Hurricane Ismael were from a northward bulge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in early August, which resulted in the formation of a tropical depression on August 8\\\\. Six hours later, it was upgraded into Tropical storm Ismael. Continuing to intensity, Ismael was upgraded into a hurricane late on August 10 and subsequently developed an eye. The storm soon reached its peak of . Late on August 11, Hurricane Ismael began to weaken as it encountered cooler waters and the hurricane was soon downgraded to a Category 1 on the SSHWS. The following day, Ismael was downgraded into a tropical storm about west of the Baja California peninsula. On August 14, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression while centered about west of Point Ensenada. Ismael dissipated that day. While still out at sea, Ismael brought waves to much of Southern California, though waves from the storm were less than expected. One person was swept away at a beach. The remnants of the storm later moved over South California, resulting in moderate rainfall. The Yucca Valley was the worst hit by the storm, where nearly every road was washed out. Almost 50,000 residents in Palm Springs were isolated due to rains. A tornado near Los Angeles led to minor damage. In San Bernardino, many buildings were destroyed, forcing numerous evacuations. Around 80,000 homes were left without power across the Inland Empire. Moreover, three interstates were closed. In all, minor injuries were reported and three people died in San Bernardino when their car swept into a channel. Damage from the storm totaled $19 million (1983 USD). After affecting California, the remnants of the hurricane moved into Nevada. Many parking lots in Laughlin were flooded. Two small towns were also isolated. Several major streets in the outskirts of Las Vegas were closed because of flooding. =Tropical Depression Eleven= The eleventh cyclone of the 1983 season formed from an intense area of thunderstorms located over the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 11 and 12. After crossing the Mexican mainland, it emerged into the Pacific basin near Guadalajara early on August 13\\\\. After turning northwest, it intensified into a depression two days later after showing sign of a circulation. The depression continued northwest with little change in wind speed, and on August 16, about 24 hours after formation, the depression dissipated after its circulation ceased very close to landfall on the Baja California peninsula. =Tropical Depression One-C= Tropical Depression One-C formed on August 19 far from land, with winds of . It moved steadily west. Despite being over warm waters, One-C quickly weakened and lost deep convection. The depression dissipated on August 20 after briefly developing a closed circulation. =Tropical Storm Juliette= Tropical Storm Juliette originated from a tropical depression that first formed on August 24 east-northeast of Clipperton Island. Moving west-northwest and briefly west, the depression gradually intensified. The system then turned northwest around a ridge off the west coast of Baja California Sur. At 1800 UTC on August 26, the EPHC announced that the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm. Moving toward a strong trough off the west coast of the peninsula, Juliette reached its peak intensity as a mid-level tropical storm early on August 29, with winds of . Upon attaining peak intensity, Juliette developed an eye. However, Juliette began to weaken over cooler water. Meanwhile, the trough weakened and Tropical Storm Juliette headed west. On August 30, the EPHC remarked that Juliette was downgraded into a depression. Two days later, Tropical Depression Juliette had dissipated over cold water. =Tropical Depression Two-C= A disturbance in the ITCZ developed a circulation on August 29 and organized into a tropical depression two days later. Traveling west-northwest, Two-C was initially in a favorable environment, and was thus expected to become a tropical storm. However, it soon encountered a trough and dry air, which arrested development. It crossed the international dateline on September 1 and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on the system. The depression gradually weakened and dissipated on September 8\\\\. Its remnants lingered near the Marshall Islands for a few more days. =Hurricane Kiko= Hurricane Kiko originated from a tropical disturbance that crossed Central America on August 26 and 27. After emerging into the Pacific, the disturbance moved steadily westward. At 0600 UTC on August 31, the EPHC classified the system as a tropical depression about south of Salina Cruz. A well-developed ridge was centered over New Mexico and was moving southward, causing light wind shear over the system. At 1800 UTC on August 31, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kiko. Initially expected to turn west and head out to sea, the storm moved northwest while paralleling the Mexican coast. Early on September 1, Kiko began to explosively deepen, and by 1800 UTC, it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS, bypassing both Category 1 and 2 status. Six hours later, the EPHC reported that Kiko had intensified into a low-end Category 4. After remaining at this intensity for 30 hours, the hurricane resumed intensification, attaining its peak intensity of late on September 3 about west of L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Shortly after its peak, a combination of cooler waters and increased wind shear associated with the subtropical jetstream resulted in rapid weakening. Hurricane Kiko was soon downgraded to Category 3 status on the SSHWS, before briefly re-intensifying on September 4. That day, Kiko resumed weakening and was downgraded to a Category 2 as the storm turned west-northwest away from the Mexican coast. On September 5, the storm was downgraded into a Category 1 system; by this time, the EPHC revised their forecast and expected the storm to accelerate and approach Baja California. On September 7, Kiko weakened into a tropical storm. Subsequently, the system turned north and was downgraded to a tropical depression the next day. Now devoid of convection, Kiko dissipated early on September 9 about west-southwest of Baja California. The outer rainbands of Hurricane Kiko caused considerable damage to homes and hotels situated near the coast of Mexico, forcing the evacuation of hundreds. The resorts of Tecom√°n and Manzanillo were the worst hit by the storm. Outside of Colima, however, little damage was reported. Kiko brought high clouds to the extreme southwestern portion of the Baja California Peninsula for four days. While at sea, Hurricane Kiko was responsible for waves along Newport Beach, California, resulting in more than 100 lifeguard rescues. As a weakening tropical system, Kiko brought subtropical moisture and high clouds to California. =Hurricane Lorena= Towards the end of the first week of September, the next cyclone of the season was starting to form south of the Mexican coast. A disturbance moved westward and was classified as a tropical depression about south of Acapulco early on September 6\\\\. Like Kiko, the storm deepened rapidly, and was upgraded into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day. Initially moving very slowly, the storm made a sharp turn northwest, parallel to the coast of Mexico. Accelerating, a poorly defined eye first became visible on satellite imagery around 1500 UTC on September 7\\\\. The EPHC upgraded Lorena into a hurricane three hours later. Early the next day, Lorena intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. At 1200 UTC on September 8, Lorena attained winds of a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS; simultaneously, the storm reached its peak intensity, with winds of . After maintaining peak intensity for six hours, Lorena began to weaken over cooler waters. Very early on September 9, the EPHC downgraded Lorena weakened into a Category 1 hurricane; the storm was expected to emerge into the southern Gulf of California in about 48 hours and thereafter meander. However, this did not occur. Meanwhile, Lorena was re- upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane, an intensity of which it held on to for 12 hours. After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Lorena moved west-northwest and into a low wind shear environment. Subsequently, Lorena attained its secondary peak with winds of while passing about south of Cabo San Lucas. However, cooler water began to take its toll on the storm and on September 12, the storm was downgraded into a Category 1. Later that day, Lorena weakened into a tropical storm due to a combination of strong shear and cold sea surface temperatures. Midday on September 13, the EPHC downgraded the system into a tropical depression. Furthermore, the system dissipated 18 hours later. At the time of dissipation, Lorena was centered about west-southwest of San Diego. Hurricane Lorena brought rough surf and squally weather to much of the coast of Mexico, particularly Manzanillo. Furthermore, it was also responsible for $33,000 in damage to Acapulco. Seven people died due to flooding. Four ships drowned in the storm; as a result, many local ports were closed. In addition, a mudslide blocked a portion of the Pan-American Highway. =Hurricane Manuel= A vigorous tropical disturbance was first noted on September 10 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Despite the presence of wind shear, the EPHC upgraded system into a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on September 12 and a tropical storm at 1200 UTC that day while centered around south of Puerto Escondido. Manuel reached hurricane strength early on September 14\\\\. Several hours later, Manuel reached a secondary peak wind speed of . However, this trend was short lived, and very early on September 15, the storm's wind diminished to , only to reintensify again that evening. Early on September 16, Manuel turned towards the north while developing a small eye. Hurricane Manuel maintained winds of for a day before the EPHC upgraded Manuel into a Category 2 hurricane. On September 17, however, Manuel developed a much larger and well-defined eye; that afternoon; Manuel reaching its peak intensity of as a major hurricane. The storm held onto major hurricane winds for 12 hours before subsequently weakening. At 0000 UTC on September 18, the eye collapsed as it began to encounter colder ocean temperatures. Manuel was intercepted by a Hurricane Hunter aircraft that day, which found no evidence of an eyewall, thus, Manuel was downgraded into a tropical storm about south of San Diego. After turning north-northeast, Hurricane Hunters penetrated the storm for the second time, noting that the storm was a swirl of clouds. On September 19, the EPHC downgraded the system into a depression. The following day, Manuel made landfall along the eastern portion of Guadalupe Island before dissipating at 1200 UTC. The remnants of Hurricane Manuel later brought rain to the southwestern United States. The outer rainbands of Manuel began to produce moisture over the region on September 18, and continued until September 21. In the mountains and deserts of California, the storm brought heavy rains across. A laboratory near Palm Springs recorded a peak rainfall total of . A total 3,000 customers lost electricity in Porterville because of high winds, heavy rains, which led to minor damage. Numerous fires occurred in Kern County, but none of these fires caused major damage. Further east, in Arizona, isolated rain showers were reported, peaking at at the Alamo Dam. Along the northern portion of Baja California, Manuel brought showers and high waves. In all, impact from the storm was less than anticipated. =Tropical Storm Narda= Several hours after Manuel dissipated on September 20, a tropical disturbance formed south of Socorro Island. While situated south of a ridge, the disturbance started to deepen. After developing a circulation, the system was declared a tropical depression the morning of September 21\\\\. Later that morning, the EPHC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical storm. Narda held on to marginal tropical storm intensity for 36 hours before quickly intensifying, and by September 23, the storm had attained winds of . Thereafter, the storm turned west-northwest and weakened steadily after encountering cooler water. On September 26, the EPHC downgraded Narda into a depression. After accelerating, the storm entered the CPHC zone the next day. Tropical Storm Narda then began to encounter slightly warmer waters, and thus began to restrengthen. At 1800 UTC on September 27, the CPHC announced that Narda had regained tropical storm strength. It quickly intensified and early on September 29, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of and the formation of an eye. At this time, Narda was located about southeast of Hilo. That evening, the storm start to show signs of weakening as it turned southwest away from the Hawaiian group. On September 30, however, Narda, with winds of , made its closest approach the Hawaii, passing south of South Point. After briefly intensifying on October 1, it suddenly dissipated hours later. Because of data from tropical cyclone forecast models, which showed Narda passing very near the Hawaiian islands, and fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, a hurricane watch was posted for all the Hawaiian Islands at 0700 UTC on September 28. Gale warnings and high surf advisories were issued for the entire state. Officials urged many Hawaiians to complete preparations by the night of September 28. Campers at coastal parks were also ordered by police to find shelter on higher ground. However, the hurricane watch was discontinued after Narda veered away on September 29. Meanwhile, gale warnings and high surf advisories were dropped that day for all islands except for the Big Island. The outer rainbands of Narda brought locally heavy rain to the state. Flooding was reported of eastern areas of the Big Island. Nine families were evacuated to shelters. Higher than normal surf was also observed on southeast and east facing beaches. Overall, damage from Narda was minor. =Tropical Storm Octave= A tropical disturbance formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 23, which moved west for four days prior to attaining tropical depression status. Initially, the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased in the vicinity of the storm. However, on September 28, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Octave. Six hours later, Octave attained its peak intensity of and decreased in forward speed while turning to the northeast. On September 30, began to weaken due to cooler waters and increasing vertical wind shear. At 1200 UTC on October 2, the EPHC issued their last advisory on the storm, as the surface circulation had dissipated. Due to the threat for flooding, local flood warnings were issued for much of Arizona. In the end, the highest rainfall associated with Octave was at Mount Graham. Throughout the state, excessive rainfall caused many rivers to overflow. The Santa Cruz, Rillito, and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record. Runoff from both the Rillito and Santa Cruz rivers flooded Marana. Major flooding was reported along the Gila River, and two of its tributaries, the San Francisco River and the San Pedro River. These rains devastated Clifton along the San Francisco River valley. Over 700 homes were destroyed in Clifton. Further south along the Gila River, major flooding was reported in extreme southeastern Arizona. Willcox was nearly flooded. Further west, in Phoenix, 150 people were evacuated from an apartment complex. Throughout the greater Phoenix area, eight fires were started via lighting. Tropical Storm Octave was considered the worst flood in Pima County history. Octave is also regarded as the worst tropical system to affect Arizona. Around 3,000 buildings were damaged due to Octave. A total of 853 structures were destroyed by Octave while 2,052 others were damaged. About 10,000 people were temporarily displaced. Damage in Arizona totaled $500 million. Fourteen people drowned and 975 persons were injured. Elsewhere, in New Mexico, a peak total of of rain was recorded, resulting in flooding. New Mexico governor Toney Anaya declared a state of emergency in Catron County. Damage in New Mexico was estimated at $12.5 million. In Mexico, of rain was reported in Altar. In Sonora, many roads were closed. On October 3, Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt declared a state of emergency. President Ronald Reagan declared eight Arizona counties a \\"major disaster area\\" on October 5. =Hurricane Priscilla= While Tropical Storm Octave was still active, a tropical disturbance formed on September 29 near Clipperton Island. The disturbance moved northwest, and was upgraded into a depression at 1800 UTC. While moving beneath the southwest side of a ridge, Priscilla steadily intensified. Early on October 3, Priscilla was upgraded into a hurricane. After remaining a Category 1 hurricane for most of the day, it was upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane that evening, and subsequently, began to rapidly intensify. At 0000 UTC on October 4, about 24 hours after first becoming a hurricane, Priscilla was upgraded into a major hurricane, with winds of . While at peak, which it held on for 12 hours, Priscilla displayed a well-defined eye. Additionally, the hurricane began a sharp turn to the north-northwest due to a strong trough off the Southern California coast and the storm was initially expected to move onshore Baja California and bring flooding rains to Arizona. Shortly after its peak, Priscilla began to encounter cooler waters and thus it start to slowly lose strength. During the pre-dawn hours of October 5, Priscilla weakened into a Category 2\\\\. Later that day, it was downgraded into a Category 1 system. By 0000 UTC on October 6, the EPHC downgraded the system into a tropical storm. By this time, it was anticipated that the system would make landfall as a tropical system on California. Quickly weakening, Priscilla was downgraded into a depression that day. Early on October 7, Priscilla dissipated about southwest of Guadalupe Island. Due to the storm's threat to California, flash flood watches were issued for much of the southern portion of the state. In Arizona, heavy equipment was evacuated from flood-prone areas. Along the central Baja California peninsula, showers were reported. While still a Category 2 hurricane, the outer rainbands of Priscilla brought rains to California, resulting in power outages, hail, and traffic accidents. In Los Angeles, a daily rainfall record was set. Some streets in Anaheim and Santa Ana were flooded. The roof of a church was also damaged. Consequently, flash flood warnings were posted for parts of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Offshore, rough seas were generated. Across northwestern Arizona and Nevada, heavy showers and thunderstorms occurred. The remnants of the storm moved over the area on October 7. Rainfall totals were less than expected and most weather stations recorded less than of precipitation. A peak total of was measured in Ely. =Hurricane Raymond= A tropical wave crossed Nicaragua on October 5, moving westward. A ridge center was over Mexico and a well- developed ridge extended westward towards the Hawaiian Islands. Despite the presence of strong wind shear, it was upgraded to a tropical depression south- southeast of Cabo San Lucas on October 8\\\\. The depression moved over waters, intensifying into Tropical Storm Raymond on October 9\\\\. Intensifying quickly, Raymond attained hurricane status on October 10\\\\. Hurricane Raymond subsequently developed a small but distinct eye. Rapidly intensifying, the storm rapidly moved west. Raymond was upgraded into a major hurricane late on October 10\\\\. Raymond reached its peak winds of as a moderate Category 4 hurricane roughly 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. At the time of its peak, the hurricane was located about south of San Diego. Raymond is believed to have held on to peak intensity for almost two days. The hurricane subsequently weakened and was only a Category 2 by October 13, but it re- intensified over the next few days. With continued warm waters, the system crossed into the CPHC warning zone, reaching a secondary peak of on October 14 while becoming one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the region. By then, Raymond had begun a movement to the northwest. The eye later became poorly defined while the symmetric shape of the hurricane became elongated. The Hurricane Hunters confirmed the weakening trend, reporting a pressure of . Hurricane Raymond weakened to a tropical storm on October 16 as wind shear took its toll on the storm. Meanwhile, the storm drifted northwest and underwent several loops. Two days later the storm resumed its westward motion as it weakened to a tropical depression. It became devoid of deep convection, and made landfall on Molokai on October 20 while still tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Raymond dissipated inland. Because meteorologists were predicting that the storm may pose a threat to the Hawaiian island group, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for Hawaii. A high-surf advisory also was issued. As Raymond approached Hawaii, the cyclone kicked up very high surfs that pounded the big island. On the east end of the Hawaiian Island chain was battered by waves. In addition, Raymond brought beneficial rains and gusty winds on all islands. Precipitation ranged from on Maui. There was one casualty when a sailor, Richard Sharp, was killed overboard off the 44-foot yacht \\"Haza√±a\\"; the boat, which was dismasted, was traveling from Tahiti to San Diego, but the course was altered to Hawaii because of the storm.The story of Richard Sharp and his companion, Tami Oldham Ashcraft, was the basis for the movie Adrift, made in 2018 =Tropical Storm Sonia= Situated several hundred miles west of Hurricane Raymond, a tropical disturbance formed on October 8. Moving west-northwest, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on October 9. After moving west-northwest for 12 hours, it turned west. Despite warm waters, strong westerly wind shear prevented much further development. On October 10, the EPHC upgraded Sonia into a tropical storm. That day, Sonia reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h). However, this was short-lived as the thunderstorm activity quickly became displaced from the center. At 0000 UTC on October 11, Sonia weakened into a tropical depression. About 24 hours later, Sonia weakened into a tropical disturbance after it failed to maintain a closed circulation. Thereafter, the storm entered the CPHC's warning zone, where it began to encounter warmer waters and lighter wind shear, and thus began to deepen. On October 13, Sonia regained tropical storm intensity and briefly posed a threat to Hawaii. Despite remaining small and disorganized, Sonia reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) for a second time that evening. However, outflow from Hurricane Raymond weakened the system and Sonia dissipated on October 14 over south-southeast of the Big Island. =Hurricane Tico= The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7\\\\. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575 mi (930 km) south of Acapulco. On October 12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13\\\\. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. By October 16, Tico had reached major hurricane status. Early on October 19, it reached peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatl√°n with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front. The remnants of Tico were last observed on October 24 over Ohio. Moderate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98 in (228 mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1-3 in (25-75 mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border. Two 328 ft (100 m) anchored ships were washed aground by strong waves and swells, with a total of seven ships reported missing. Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000 acres (77 km¬≤) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatl√°n. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Twenty-five thousand people were left homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200 million (1983 USD). Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135 deaths in Mexico. Rain from Tico continued into the South-Central United States; serious flooding was reported along the lower Washita River. Across Guthire, 5% of the town's population, sought three emergency shelter due to deep water. Throughout Oklahoma and Texas, 200 people were displaced and six people were killed. A total of $77 million in crop damage occurred in Oklahoma. Total damage in the state was estimated at $84 million. Elsewhere, one person was killed in the Kansas. =Tropical Depression Twenty-Two= On October 18, a tropical disturbance was noted about south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving west- northwest, the disturbance was upgraded into a depression. After turning northwest, the depression dissipated an hour before moving ashore. Lasting less than 24 hours, Twenty-Two was the shortest-lived storm of the season. Despite the lack of damage, of rain was measured along portions of the Southern Mexico coast. =Tropical Storm Velma= A tropical disturbance developed within the ITCZ during October 31. Despite unfavorable conditions, the system began to organize, and became Tropical Depression Twenty-Three on November 1. It quickly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Velma six hours later. No further intensification occurred; Velma peaked as a minimal tropical storm. The tropical storm began to weaken after 18 hours, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on November 2. The following day, the EPHC issued the final advisory on Tropical Depression Velma. =Hurricane Winnie= Due to a combination of unusually warm sea surface temperatures and the displacement of the ITCZ to north, a small area of disturbed weather formed in early December. Situated south-southwest of Acapulco, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression on December 4. It slowly headed north, and intensified into a tropical storm. Winnie peaked in intensity on December 6, and became the strongest Pacific hurricane in December since records began.. Initially expected to continue north, the storm stalled instead. Due to wind shear caused by a trough, Winnie began to rapidly deteriorate, and it was downgraded into a tropical storm that night. After weakening further into a depression, Winnie dissipated on December 7. Its remnant disturbance then moved west. Winnie was an out of season storm, and is the only known December tropical cyclone in the east Pacific proper since the modern record began in 1949. Winnie is the latest hurricane on record in the eastern North Pacific. Although the tropical cyclone never made landfall, it caused rain in parts of Mexico. The highest total of was recorded in Caleta de Campos. Furthermore, the storm brought strong winds to the region, but damage was less than expected. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1983. All the names on the list were used this year. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1989 season. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for the name Priscilla which was previously used in the old four-year lists. No central Pacific names were used; the first name used would have been Keli. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Adolph * Barbara * Cosme * Dalilia * Erick * Flossie * Gil  * Henriette * Ismael * Juliette * Kiko * Lorena * Manuel * Narda  * Octave * Priscilla * Raymond * Sonia * Tico * Velma * Winnie } See also *List of Pacific hurricanes *Pacific hurricane season *1983 Atlantic hurricane season *1983 Pacific typhoon season *1983 North Indian Ocean cyclone season *Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons: 1982‚Äì83, 1983‚Äì84 References External links * Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones of 1983 * CPHC Season Summary * Unisys Weather archive for the Eastern Pacific, 1983 * CPHC archive accessed November 15, 2005 Category:Pacific hurricane seasons 1983 EPAC ","title":"1983 Pacific hurricane season"},{"id":"2188104","text":"Heart of the Congos is a roots reggae album by The Congos, produced by Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry at his Black Ark studio with a studio band including Boris Gardiner on bass and Ernest Ranglin on guitar. The album was released in 1977. It is noted as being one of Perry's masterpiece productions of the Black Ark era. The first issue of the LP in Jamaica was a very limited release said to consist of only several hundred copies. It was remastered using the original Black Ark quarter inch master tapes with the exception of 'At The Feast' and re-released in 1996 on the Blood & Fire label, run by Steve Barrow, T Elwing, and Mick Hucknall, with assistance on the ground provided by Andrea Lewis (Jamaica). The original mix of the album was not officially re-issued on either LP or CD until 2017's 40th Anniversary Edition (although an 'unofficial' CD release, sourced from the original LP, was released in 2004 by CORN-FED Productions, based in Amsterdam). Until 2017, all editions subsequent to the first Jamaica release feature a 2nd, substantially different, mix by Lee Perry.

Haynie was born in Reedville, Virginia. He studied at the College of William and Mary in Virginia and at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. He also served in the United States Coast Guard during the end of World War II and the Korean War. In 1958, Barry Bingham, Sr., hired Haynie to serve as a political cartoonist for the Louisville Courier-Journal, a position he held until his retirement in 1996, after which he was retained as an emeritus. His cartooning style was clean lined, heavily inked, and somewhat reminiscent of Al Capp. Haynie regularly penned his wife's name, Lois, into his drawings. Haynie won several awards for his work. He won the Headliner Award in 1966 and the Freedoms Foundation Medal in 1966 and 1970. The Kentucky Civil Liberties Union named him Civil Libertarian of the Year in 1978, and he was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1987.

It was at that time the most active season in the basin until it was later surpassed by the 1985 season. It officially started June 1, 1982, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1982, in the central Pacific, and lasted until October 31, 1982, in the central Pacific and until November 15, 1982, in the Eastern Pacific. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. At that time, the season was considered as the most active season within the basin in terms of named storms, however, the 1985 season surpassed these numbers just three years later. The 1982 season was an eventful one. Hurricane Paul killed over 1,000 people before it was named. Hurricanes Daniel and Gilma both briefly threatened Hawaii, while Hurricane Iwa caused heavy damage to Kauai and Niihau. The remnants of Hurricane Olivia brought heavy rain to a wide swath of the western United States. __TOC__ Seasonal summary ImageSize = width:811 height:221 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1982 till:02/12/1982 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1982 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:20/05/1982 till:29/05/1982 color:TS text:\\"Aletta (TS) from:31/05/1982 till:04/06/1982 color:TD text:\\"Two (TD)\\" from:13/06/1982 till:15/06/1982 color:TD text:\\"Three (TD) from:15/06/1982 till:17/06/1982 color:TS text:\\"Bud (TS) from:17/06/1982 till:19/06/1982 color:TD text:\\"Five (TD)\\" from:01/07/1982 till:06/07/1982 color:TS text:\\"Carlotta (TS)\\" from:03/07/1982 till:03/07/1982 color:TD text:\\"Seven (TD)\\" from:07/07/1982 till:22/07/1982 color:C3 text:\\"Daniel (C3)\\" from:12/07/1982 till:15/07/1982 color:TS text:\\"Emilia (TS)\\" barset:break from:13/07/1982 till:14/07/1982 color:TD text:\\"Ten (TD)\\" from:15/07/1982 till:17/07/1982 color:TD text:\\"Eleven (TD)\\" from:17/07/1982 till:25/07/1982 color:C1 text:\\"Fabio (C1)\\" from:26/07/1982 till:02/08/1982 color:C3 text:\\"Gilma (C3)\\" from:29/07/1982 till:03/08/1982 color:C1 text:\\"Hector (C1)\\" from:01/08/1982 till:08/08/1982 color:TS text:\\"Iva (TS)\\" from:02/08/1982 till:11/08/1982 color:C3 text:\\"John (C3)\\" from:08/08/1982 till:17/08/1982 color:C1 text:\\"Kristy (C1)\\" from:08/08/1982 till:11/08/1982 color:TS text:\\"Lane (TS)\\" barset:break from:30/08/1982 till:06/09/1982 color:C1 text:\\"Miriam (C1)\\" from:30/08/1982 till:02/09/1982 color:TS text:\\"Akoni (TS)\\" from:09/09/1982 till:18/09/1982 color:C2 text:\\"Norman (C2)\\" from:10/09/1982 till:12/09/1982 color:TD text:\\"Twenty-One (TD)\\" from:15/09/1982 till:19/09/1982 color:TS text:\\"Ema (TS)\\" from:15/09/1982 till:19/09/1982 color:TS text:\\"Hana (TS)\\" from:18/09/1982 till:25/09/1982 color:C4 text:\\"Olivia (C4)\\" from:18/09/1982 till:30/09/1982 color:C2 text:\\"Paul (C2) from:30/09/1982 till:06/10/1982 color:TS text:\\"Rosa (TS) barset:break from:14/10/1982 till:23/10/1982 color:C3 text:\\"Sergio (C3)\\" from:19/10/1982 till:26/10/1982 color:TS text:\\"Tara (TS)\\" from:19/11/1982 till:25/11/1982 color:C1 text:\\"Iwa (C1) bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0, -20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/1982 till:01/06/1982 text:May from:01/06/1982 till:01/07/1982 text:June from:01/07/1982 till:01/08/1982 text:July from:01/08/1982 till:01/09/1982 text:August from:01/09/1982 till:01/10/1982 text:September from:01/10/1982 till:01/11/1982 text:October from:01/11/1982 till:01/12/1982 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" This season had twenty-three tropical storms, twelve hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. Three tropical storms and one hurricane-- a record number of named storms-- formed in the central Pacific. This was largely due to the strong 1982‚Äì83 El Ni√±o event, which was present during the season. However, this was surpassed in the 2015 Pacific hurricane season with eight storms. This is the first year that named storms forming between the dateline and 140¬∞W were given names from the Hawaiian language. Previous to this year, names and numbers from the western Pacific's typhoon list were used. After this year, it was decided that the six-year lists would be used, instead of the four-year ones. That is why the 1978 season's list was used again this season. Systems =Tropical Storm Aletta= The origins of Aletta are from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on May 18 about 500 mi (800 km) south- southwest of Acapulco. On May 20, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. Moving northwest, the depression became Tropical Storm Aletta 36 hours later. The system re-curved towards the northeast due to strong upper- level westerlies, reaching its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on May 23. Shortly after its peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the system briefly leveled off in intensity for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. On May 25, Aletta slowed and moved in a large clockwise loop until May 28\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May 29 roughly 180 mi (290 km/h) southwest of Acapulco. The outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Aletta produced torrential rains and high winds over Central America for several days, with a peak of in Chinandega. Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60 percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed. Throughout the country, 108 people were killed, Roughly 20,000 people were homeless and total damage was estimated at $365 million (1982 USD); damage to highways, factories, and farms alone exceeded $100 million. In one village, the storm left 270 missing and only 29 survivors. The capital city of Leon was hardest hit by Aletta, which was considered the worst disaster in the country in three years. Across Honduras, 200 people were killed and 5,000 people were without food or water 13 communities. A total of 80,000 people were homeless. Total damage was placed at $101 million (1982 USD). Following the storm, soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines. In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief. =Tropical Depression Two-E= This system originated as a low in the western Caribbean Sea on the morning of May 27. The next day it moved southwest into Guatemala with significant thunderstorm activity, emerging into the Gulf of Tehuantepec around noon on May 29. By May 31, it was organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. Slowly weakening on June 1 as it remained quasi-stationary, the system dissipated in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 4. =Tropical Depression Three-E= This cyclone formed well to the west-southwest of Mexico on June 12. The depression slowly recurved due to an upper level low located well to its north-northwest. By June 15, vertical wind shear had taken its toll and the system dissipated about 300 mi (500 km) north of where it formed. =Tropical Storm Bud= On June 15, this cyclone formed about 460 mi (740 km) southwest of Acapulco. Drifting west-northwest, it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. Maximum sustained winds peaked near 50 mph (80 km/h) late on June 15. Turning south of due west, vertical wind shear weakened Bud, with the cyclone dissipating by the morning of June 17 about 23 mi (370 km) north-northwest of Clipperton Island. =Tropical Depression Five-E= Late on June 16, deep convection organized in the Gulf of Tehuantepec into a tropical depression. Transcribing a small clockwise loop, the system moved west-northwest. Interaction with Mexico likely played a role in its weakening as water temperatures under the system were never below 82 ¬∞F (28 ¬∞C). The system dissipated about 90 mi (150 km) south of Puerto √Ångel by the morning of June 19. =Tropical Storm Carlotta= A tropical wave crossed Central America on June 26, creating an area of thunderstorms just inside the tropical eastern Pacific that morning. Cyclonic turning was evident by the night of June 30 while located roughly 350 mi (550 km) south of Manzanillo as the system continued westward. Slowly turning northwest, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression early on July 1 and a tropical storm by nightfall. Maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (97 km/h) by noon July 3. Increasingly southwest flow aloft turned Carlotta more northward into cooler waters, causing the cyclone to regain tropical depression status on the evening of July 4, ultimately dissipating southwest of Cabo San Lucas the next evening. =Tropical Depression Seven-E= The system formed between Tropical Storm Carlotta and the Hawaiian Islands on the evening of July 2. Slowly recurving north and northeast, the system moved into cooler waters and dissipated about 100 mi (160 km) north of where it formed by the afternoon of July 3. =Hurricane Daniel= Tropical Depression Eight-E formed south of Mexico on July 7. Moving west-northwest, the cyclone slowly strengthened into a tropical storm around noon on July 8 before becoming a hurricane late in the afternoon of July 9. Daniel reached its maximum intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) early in the morning of July 11 a few hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As the storm moved westward, it slowly weakened. Daniel regained tropical storm status during the night of July 14, entering the Central Pacific Basin as a weakening tropical storm on the morning of July 16. Daniel retained tropical storm intensity for the next few days before weakening into a tropical depression about 280 mi (450 km) south southwest of the Big Island of Hawaii, being sheared by the same upper trough that caused Emilia's dissipation a few days earlier. Daniel turned northward, and on July 22, dissipated in the Alenuihaha Channel between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. =Tropical Storm Emilia= Tropical Depression Nine-E developed near 10.0¬∞ N 136.5¬∞ W on the morning of July 12. Intensifying, the cyclone became a tropical storm later that day. Emilia moved westward around 13 mph (21 km/h) and entered the Central Pacific Basin on the night of July 12. Over the next day, the storm moved west-northwest, reaching maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). An upper trough to the west weakened Emilia rapidly due to vertical wind shear, and the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status early on the morning of July 15. Dissipation of the tropical depression was noted by afternoon. =Tropical Depression Ten-E= To the east of Daniel, a tropical depression formed on the evening of July 13 a few hundred miles west- southwest of Manzanillo. The system moved westward and weakened thereafter, dissipating about 200 mi (320 km) west of where it had formed by the afternoon of July 14. =Tropical Depression Eleven-E= A tropical disturbance was spotted about 650 mi (930 km) southwest of Acapulco on July 12. By the evening of July 15, cyclonic turning was evident and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression. Moving unsteadily to the west-northwest, the system weakened, dissipating a few hundred miles west-northwest of where it had formed. =Hurricane Fabio= The cyclone developed as a tropical depression southeast of Manzanillo on July 17. Over the next couple of days, it strengthened rapidly into a hurricane as it moved northwest, peaking in intensity with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds. Gradual weakening occurred as Fabio turned westward along the 19th parallel north into cooler waters, eventually dissipating late on July 24. =Hurricane Gilma= Tropical Depression Thirteen-E formed near 9.5¬∞N 117¬∞30'W and moved slightly north of west. Tropical storm status was attained near noon on July 26, and the cyclone crossed the threshold of hurricane strength late on the night of July 27. By noon on July 29, Gilma reached it maximum intensity of 125 mph (200 km/h) well to the east-southeast of Hawaii. The cyclone weakened and sped up its motion to the west-northwest, crossing into the Central Pacific Basin as a category one hurricane very early on July 30. Gilma was downgraded to a tropical storm late in the morning of July 30, and a tropical depression early on the morning of August 1 as the circulation passed 50 mi (80 km) south of South Point. The cyclone dissipated late on August 1 as it passed 200 mi (300 km) south of Kauai. =Hurricane Hector= On July 23, a tropical wave moved off the Colombian coast. The related convection moved westward at over 20 mph (32 km/h). By the evening of July 27, the system slowed its forward motion. The next evening, a tropical depression organized within the thunderstorm activity well to the south of Baja California. Strengthening continued, as Hector became a tropical storm on the morning of July 29 and a hurricane by noon on July 30. A combination of vertical wind shear and cooler waters ahead of the cyclone led to its weakening trend, which hastened on August 1. It weakened to a tropical storm on the morning of August 2 and to a depression soon thereafter while located midway between the Hawaiian Islands and southern Baja California. =Tropical Storm Iva= A tropical disturbance was discovered 300 mi (460 km) south of Acapulco on July 31. Moving west-northwest, it achieved tropical depression status that night and tropical storm status on August 2 while 800 mi (1,340 km) west-southwest of Acapulco. Northeasterly upper level shear appears to have been Iva's nemesis, as the system weakened back into a tropical depression by the afternoon of August 3 as it turned west-southwest. The depression maintained strength for another several days before dissipating well east-southwest of Hilo, Hawaii, on the morning of August 8. =Hurricane John= Tropical Depression Sixteen-E formed on August 3 in the East Pacific between Hawaii and Mexico. The system intensified into a tropical storm by noon August 4, and a hurricane on the morning of August 5. John reached its peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) as it moved into the Central Pacific Basin on August 6. Weakening commenced on August 7 due to westerly vertical wind shear caused by the semi-permanent mid-oceanic upper trough, and John weakened to a tropical storm on the night of August 8. It passed by as a tropical depression about 180 mi (290 km) south of the Island of Hawaii, and dissipated late on August 10 to the southwest of Hawaii. =Hurricane Kristy= Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed by noon on August 8 in the East Pacific. The low moved west, intensified, and became Tropical Storm Kristy by midnight, and a hurricane by midnight on the night of August 9. Weakening as it entered the Central Pacific, Kristy regained tropical storm status late on August 10 while moving south of due west at a rapid 30 mph (48 km/h). As it slowed down and turned northwest, Kristy began to restrengthen. Hurricane intensity was reached again on the evening of August 13. By noon on August 14, the cyclone passed 250 mi (400 km) south of South Point, Hawaii. Westerly winds aloft slowed Kristy's forward motion down additionally, and Kristy weakened back into a tropical storm on August 15. Turning more to the west with the low level wind flow, the cyclone was downgraded to a tropical depression by noon on August 16 and dissipated that night southwest of Hawaii. =Tropical Storm Lane= The originating disturbance of this system emerged off San Jos√©, Costa Rica on August 4 and slowly consolidated. By the afternoon of August 8, Tropical Depression Eighteen-E developed well south of Cabo San Lucas. The next morning it had continued strengthening into a tropical storm. Maximum sustained winds reached 60 mph (97 km/h) as it continued moving west- northwest. Vertical wind shear reached Lane on August 10, which led to weakening. It weakened to a tropical depression late on August 11, but sporadic thunderstorm blowups near the center kept the system alive for another few days. Dissipation occurred on the evening of August 14 as it crossed the 140th meridian west. =Hurricane Miriam= Tropical Depression Nineteen-E formed on August 29 a couple hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression moved west-northwestward, intensifying into a tropical storm by noon on August 30 and a hurricane by noon on August 31. Peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) was attained during the early morning of September 1. For the next couple of days, Miriam remained unchanged in strength. By late on September 3, a weakening trend was realized as it passed into the Central Pacific by the afternoon of September 4. Shearing apart soon afterwards, the low moved northwest and weakened into a tropical depression well to the east of Hawaii on the morning of September 5. It drifted north, and became a nontropical low by September 6. The cyclone was last noted near 30¬∞N 149¬∞W, continuing its northward trek. =Tropical Storm Akoni= Tropical Depression One-C formed along the eastern end of the West Pacific monsoon trough on August 30 about 700 mi (1120 km) east of the International Dateline, well to the west-southwest of Hawaii. Moving slowly westward, the system intensified rapidly into a tropical storm by noon and was named Akoni. The name \\"Akoni\\" is an  ªokina-less spelling of  ªAkoni, which is Hawaiian for \\"Anthony\\". Maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (97 km/h) late on August 31 as Akoni moved near the ship Nana Lolo a few hundred miles east of the International Dateline. An upper trough to the northwest set Akoni on a weakening curve, and the cyclone diminished to a tropical depression on the evening of September 1 as it moved with the low level flow. The weakening depression passed the International Dateline into the western Pacific on the morning of September 2. Akoni was the first storm to receive a name from the modern Central Pacific tropical cyclone naming list. =Hurricane Norman= Northeasterly shear slowed the development of the initial tropical depression which formed into Norman. Strengthening began in earnest on September 11, and the cyclone became a tropical storm, and then a hurricane by early on September 13. Maximum sustained winds reached nearly 95 mph (153 km/h) by September 15. A mid-latitude trough dug in from the north, weakening the ridge north of Norman and leading to a northward motion. Increased vertical wind shear and cooler waters weakened the hurricane, with dissipation occurring just west of Baja California on September 18. On September 17 and 18, moisture from Norman brought scattered rain to California and Arizona.http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/enso/tropstorm.nws =Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E= A tropical depression formed well east-southeast of Hawaii late on September 10. Moving over cooler waters soon after formation, the depression dissipated by the next evening near 14¬∞N 134¬∞W. =Tropical Storm Ema= An area of convection formed near 15¬∞N 140¬∞W and by September 15, a tropical depression had formed within the thunderstorm activity. Strengthening as it moved slowly north-northeast, the cyclone became a tropical storm late that day. Ema became stationary between the morning of September 16 and September 17 before resuming its north-northeast heading. Its peak intensity was 45 mph (72 km/h). Upper level shear weakened the system into a tropical depression by noon on September 18. As it crossed the 140th meridian west back into the eastern Pacific near the 20th parallel north, the depression dissipated. =Tropical Storm Hana= An area of thunderstorms stewed south of the Hawaiian Islands for several days. By September 15, it had organized into Tropical Depression Three-C, and quickly became a tropical storm that afternoon. The cyclone moved north-northwest for a day before slowing to a crawl for the next day. The cyclone turned southwest and weakened into a tropical depression due to vertical wind shear. It dissipated southwest of Hawaii near 13¬∞N 162¬∞W late on September 18. =Hurricane Olivia= Ship reports indicated that a tropical depression had formed about 400 mi (640 km) south-southwest of Acapulco around noon on September 18. The system drifted north-northwest, developing into a tropical storm that night. About 24 hours later, Olivia became a hurricane. Rapid intensification continued, and Olivia reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) winds around noon September 21, becoming the strongest storm of the season. The next day, waters under the tropical cyclone began to cool as the hurricane gained increasing latitude offshore Mexico. By noon on September 23, the cyclone had weakened into a tropical storm west of Baja California. Strong southwest flow to its north spread precipitation through the western United States into southwest Canada. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression about 500 mi (800 km) southwest of San Diego and the surface low was last seen dissipating on September 25 about 250 mi (400 km) west-southwest of San Diego. The heavy rain in California wiped out half of the raisin crop, a quarter of the wine crop, and a tenth of the tomato crop. Olivia's remnants brought rain totals of over 7 inches (177 mm) to California and northern Utah as they interacted with a strong upper level system and the local topography.Remains of Olivia - September 23‚Äì28, 1982 The precipitation from this storm largely contributed to the record monthly precipitation in Salt Lake City, Utah, of 7.04 in (179 mm). These rains resulted in widespread losses, mainly from agriculture, amounting to $325 million (1982 USD). =Hurricane Paul= The precursor disturbance to Paul originated from an area of low barometric pressure and disorganized thunderstorms, which was first noted near the Pacific coast of Nicaragua on September 15\\\\. Five days later, the EPHC classified it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Two. The depression turned northward and then moved inland near the El Salvador‚ÄìGuatemala border, and dissipated overland. The remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the Pacific, briefly regenerating into a tropical depression. The depression again degenerated into an open trough on September 22. Two days later, Paul regenerated for the third time. It gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC September 25. Two days later, Paul became a hurricane and turned north. As the storm neared Baja California Sur, it reached Category 2 intensity. On September 29, the hurricane crossed Baja California Sur at peak intensity. After weakening slightly inland, Paul made its final landfall near Los Mochis before rapidly dissipating overland. The tropical depression that later became Paul produced the worst natural disaster in El Salvador since 1965. A total of 761 people were killed 312 of which occurred in San Salvador, which also sustained the worst damage. About 25,000‚Äì30,000 people were left homeless. Much of San Salvador was submerged by flood waters of up to high, and even after their recession hundreds of homes remained buried under trees, debris, and of mud. In all, property damage from the storm amounted to $100 million (1982 US$) in the country; economic losses were estimated at $280 million (1982 USD). Crop damage was worth $250 million. In Guatemala, widespread catastrophic floods claimed 615 lives and left 668 others missing. More than 10,000 people were left homeless as The 200 communities were isolated from surrounding areas. Overall, economic losses of $100 million (1982 USD) were reported in the country. In Nicaragua, Paul killed 71 people and caused $356 million (1982 USD) in economic losses. Throughout southern Mexico, floods from the precursor depression to Paul killed another 225 people. Prior to landfall in the state of Baja California Sur, 50,000 people were evacuated. Furthermore, wind gusts estimated at 120 mph (195 km/h) swept through San Jos√© del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite extensive damage, no deaths were reported in the Baja California Peninsula wake of Paul. In northern Mexico, the greatest damage occurred 70 miles (110 km) south of Los Mochis in the city of Guamuchil; a total of 24 people were killed by the storm statewide, although it produced beneficial rains over the region. Agricultural damage was severe in the state of Sinaloa, with up to 40 percent of the soybean crop destroyed. In all, the state's corn production was down by 26 percent from the previous year. Total storm damage in Mexico amounted to $4.5 billion (1982 MXN; $70 million USD). The remnants of Paul moved into the United States, producing heavy rainfall in southern New Mexico and extreme West Texas. Inclement weather was observed as far inland as the Great Plains. =Tropical Storm Rosa= A well-organized tropical depression formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 30. Moving slowly northwest, the system became a tropical storm, reaching maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) on the afternoon of October 2. The system slowly weakened as it moved northwest, and Rosa brushed the Pacific coast of Mexico as a dissipating depression. =Hurricane Sergio= A tropical disturbance was noted southwest of Costa Rica on October 12. Moving west-northwest, the system organized into a tropical depression as it crossed the 91st meridian west late on October 13 and became a tropical storm by October 14 as it entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It strengthened into a hurricane late that day as it passed 95¬∞W. By the afternoon of October 17, Sergio was packing sustained winds of 120 mph (190 km/h). Cooler water was reached soon afterwards, and weakening commenced. While slowly moving west, Sergio weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon of October 21 and to a tropical depression late on October 22. The system dissipated near 19¬∞N 133¬∞W on the afternoon of October 23. =Tropical Storm Tara= A tropical disturbance emerged off the coast of Central America. Cyclonic turning was noted on the afternoon of October 19, and a tropical depression formed 350 mi (560 km) south of Acapulco. Staggering west- northwestward, the cyclone became a tropical storm by the morning of the October 22. Maximum sustained winds increased to 50 mph (80 km/h) late on October 24. As it moved over cooler waters on October 25, the system weakened to a tropical depression that afternoon, dissipating that night near 21¬∞N 130¬∞W. =Hurricane Iwa= A late-season trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression and was subsequently upgraded into Tropical Storm Iwa. At first, the After turning to the northeast, Iwa began to slowly intensify, and on November 23, Iwa strengthened into a hurricane. Iwa reached peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on November 23. Accelerating, Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November 24\\\\. After passing the island group, Iwa rapidly deteriorated; late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm. On November 25, Iwa became an extratropical cyclone. Due to the hurricane's rapid motion, storm surge extended 900 feet (275 m) inland. A total of 5,800 people were evacuated in Kauai. In addition, 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu and in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. High winds from Hurricane Iwa briefly left Kauai without power and destroyed most papaya and banyan trees. The hurricane destroyed or damaged 3,890 homes on the island. Rough seas killed a person and left four others injured in Pearl Harbor. In Oahu, damage was heaviest on the southwest side of the island. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes and 21 hotels; 418 buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu. In Niihau, 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged. Throughout the Hawaiian island group, 20 people were treated for injuries. An estimated 500 people throughout Hawaii were left homeless due to the hurricane. At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state, with damage totaling $312 million (1982 USD, $ USD). Three days after Hurricane Iwa passed the state, Governor George Ariyoshi declared the islands of Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas with President Ronald Reagan following suit on November 28, declaring Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as disaster areas. Furthermore, two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Ten years following the storm, Hurricane Iniki struck the same area. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1982. No Eastern Pacific names were retired, so it was used again in the 1988 season. This is the same list used in the 1978 season, except for Fabio, which replaced Fico. A storm was named Fabio for the first time in 1982. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Aletta * Bud * Carlotta * Daniel * Emilia * Fabio * Gilma  * Hector * Iva * John * Kristy * Lane * Miriam * Norman  * Olivia * Paul * Rosa * Sergio * Tara * Vicente (unused) * Willa (unused) } Four names from the Central Pacific list were used ‚Äì Akoni, Ema, Hana, and Iwa. This was the very first usage for all of these names. Akoni and Ema were used again in the 2019 season. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Akoni  * Ema  * Hana  * Iwa } With four names being used, this season held the record for most named storms forming in the Central Pacific, until it was surpassed by the 2015 season. =Retirement= One name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1982 season, Iwa. It was replaced with Io (which was later changed to Iona before its usage). Iwa is one of only four Central Pacific names to have been retired, the others being Iniki, Paka, and Ioke.

Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.Dr Uttam Das, Reader, Calcutta University, in his dissertation 'Hungry Shruti and Shastravirodhi Andolan' The approach of the Hungryalists was to confront and disturb the prospective readers' preconceived colonial canons. According to Pradip Choudhuri, a leading philosopher and poet of the generation, whose works have been extensively translated in French, their counter-discourse was the first voice of post-colonial freedom of pen and brush. Besides the famous four mentioned above, Utpal Kumar Basu, Binoy Majumdar, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Basudeb Dasgupta, Falguni Roy, Subhash Ghosh, Tridib Mitra, Alo Mitra, Ramananda Chattopadhyay, Anil Karanjai, Saileswar Ghosh, Karunanidhan Mukhopadhyay, and Subo Acharya were among the other leading writers and artists of the movement. Origins The origins of this movement stem from the educational establishments serving Chaucer and Spengler to the poor of India. The movement was officially launched, however, in November 1961 from the residence of Malay Roy Choudhury and his brother Samir Roychoudhury in Patna. They took the word Hungry from Geoffrey Chaucer's line \\"In Sowre Hungry Tyme\\" and they drew upon, among others, Oswald Spengler's histriographical ideas about the non-centrality of cultural evolution and progression, for philosophical inspiration. The movement was to last from 1961 to 1965. It is wrong to suggest that the movement was influenced by the Beat Generation, since Ginsberg did not visit Malay until April 1963, when he came to Patna. Poets Octavio Paz and Ernesto Cardenal were to visit Malay later during the 1960s. The hungry generation has some of the same ideals as The Papelipolas and the Barranquilla Group, both from Colombia, and the Spanish Generation of 68.  History  Writers of Hungry generation. From the top left moving clockwise: Saileswar Ghose, Malay Roy Choudhury and Subhas Ghose Basudeb Dasgupta, David Garcia and Subimal Basak. This movement is characterized by expression of closeness to nature and sometimes by tenets of Gandhianism and Proudhonianism. Although it originated at Patna, Bihar and was initially based in Kolkata, it had participants spread over North Bengal, Tripura and Benares. According to Dr. Shankar Bhattacharya, Dean at Assam University, as well as Aryanil Mukherjee, editor of Kaurab Literary Periodical, the movement influenced Allen Ginsberg as much as it influenced American poetry through the Beat poets who visited Calcutta, Patna and Benares during the 1960-1970s. Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, now a professor and editor, was associated with the Hungry generation movement. Shakti Chattopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Subhas Ghosh left the movement in 1964. More than 100 manifestos were issued during 1961-1965. Malay's poems have been published by Prof P. Lal from his Writers Workshop publication. Howard McCord published Malay Roy Choudhury's controversial poem Prachanda Boidyutik Chhutar i.e., Stark Electric Jesus from Washington State University in 1965. The poem has been translated into several languages of the world. Into German by Carl Weissner,in Spanish by Margaret Randall, in Urdu by Ameeq Hanfee, in Assamese by Manik Dass, in Gujarati by Nalin Patel, in Hindi by Rajkamal Chaudhary, and in English by Howard McCord.  Impact  The works of these participants appeared in Citylights Journal 1, 2 and 3 published between 1964 and 1966, edited by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and in special issues of American magazines including Kulchur edited by Lita Hornick, Klactoveedsedsteen edited by Carl Weissner, El Corno Emplunado edited by Margaret Randall, Evergreen Review edited by Barney Rosset, Salted Feathersedited by Dick Bakken, Intrepid edited by Alan De Loach, and San Francisco Earthquake, during the 1960s. The Hungry Generation, also known as Hungryalism, challenged the mainstream literary genres. The group wrote poetry and prose in completely different forms and experimented with the contents. The movement changed the literary atmosphere of Bengal altogether. It had influences in Hindi, Marathi, Assamese and Urdu literatures.  Hungryalists and Krittibas  There is a misconception that the Hungryalists and the Krittibas group were the same and that the Krittibas magazine was a Hungryalist platform. This is incorrect as the Krittibas was a group from the fifties. The Hungryalist movement was a sixties decade phenomenon. Krittibas magazine in its editorial had openly declared that they have no relations with the movement and that they do not approve of the philosophy of the movement.

He was part of the Rosenberg spy ring that reported to Soviet intelligence. Sarant worked on secret military radar at the United States Army Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Alexandre Feklisov, one of the KGB case officers who handled the Rosenberg spy apparatus described Sarant and Joel Barr as among the most productive members of the group. Sarant was recruited as a Soviet espionage agent by Barr. Biography A member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) during the Second World War, Sarant worked at the nuclear physics laboratory of Cornell University. () In 1941, Julius Rosenberg and Joel Barr were recruited as Soviet spies by Jacob Golos. They in turn persuaded Sarant to join the network. According to Alexander Feklissov: \\"Joel and Alfred were good friends and spent a lot of time together. I must admit that Sarant had the makings of an undercover agent; he was a cautious young man, yet full of resolve, with progressive ideas. Before we recruited him though, he had to pass a test. Barr asked Sarant to borrow some secret documents to which he had access because he, Barr, needed them for his personal use. Alfred did not hesitate in helping his friend and in the meantime the Center approved a bona fide approach.\\" Alexander Feklissov, The Man Behind the Rosenbergs (1999) pages 116 and 117 However, he was at first reluctant to become a spy but was eventually convinced to join the network by Barr. Sarant was given the code name Hughes. The Venona project transcript of 14 November 1944 reported to Moscow that Sarant had been successfully recruited. The transcript noted Sarant and Barr were roommates and good friends and proposed to pair them off and get them to photograph their own materials. Initially Barr delivered film to Rosenberg, who passed it on to officers of the Soviet intelligence. Later, Barr met directly with KGB officers; Sarant did not have direct contact with the KGB in the U.S. One transcript reports Sarant and Barr delivered 17 authentic drawings relating to the AN/APQ-7, an advanced and secret airborne radar system developed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Western Electric for the United States military. In 1946 Sarant moved to Ithaca, New York, where he worked at Cornell University in the physics laboratories. Sarant's next door neighbor was Philip Morrison, a former Manhattan Project scientist and personal friend who joined the Communist Party of the United States in 1939. Sarant knew socially several prominent physicists, including Hans Bethe and Richard Feynman. Two days after Julius Rosenberg's arrest on 17 July 1950, the FBI interviewed Sarant but did not arrest him, although it possessed decrypted MVD cables that clearly identified Sarant as a member of the Rosenberg ring. Three days later Sarant ran away with Carol Dayton, the wife of his close friend and neighbor, Bruce Dayton; Sarant and Dayton abandoned their children and spouses. The two crossed into Mexico and eluded the FBI. In Mexico City, Sarant sought assistance from officials at an obscure Polish trade office, guessing correctly that they were intelligence officers. Following instructions from the KGB, the Poles hid Sarant and Dayton in Mexico, then engineered an escape that crossing the border to Guatemala on foot, taking a freighter to Casa Blanca, and flying to Poland via Spain. After six months in Warsaw they moved on to Moscow. The KGB arranged a dramatic reunion with Barr, who was summoned from Prague, where he had fled shortly after the Rosenberg ring started to unravel. Sarant was assigned a new identity, Philip Georgievich Staros, claiming a Canadian background to explain his accent. From Moscow, Barr and Sarant were resettled in Czechoslovakia and put to work as electrical engineers. They led a team that designed and built a prototype of the Soviet bloc's first automated anti-aircraft weapon. Their technology was quickly deployed and was in use, with some minor modifications, into the 1980s. In 1956 Sarant and Barr moved to Leningrad where they were placed in charge of a military electronics research institute. They have been credited with being the founders of the Soviet microelectronics industry, in part because Sarant and Barr conceived of, designed and won political backing for the creation of Zelenograd, the Soviet Union's Silicon Valley. Sarant was the scientific director of Zelenograd until Nikita Khrushchev's forced retirement. In 1969 Sarant received a state honor for the UM-1, a computer that was widely used in Soviet industry. He led the team that created the Uzel, the first digital computer installed in a Soviet submarine. The Uzel was integrated into the Kilo-class submarines and as of 2007 was still in use in the Russian, Iranian, Chinese and Indian navies. In 1979 Sarant died of a heart attack. Carol Dayton, the woman who fled with him, returned to the United States in 1991. It was not until 1983, thirty-three years after Sarant's flight to Mexico, that the full story of Sarant's life was told. A Russian √©migr√© working at Harvard, Mark Kuchment, who had read The Rosenberg File linked Barr and Sarant to two prominent Soviet scientists, both native speakers of English. Sarant's cover name in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona project is \\"Hughes\\".  See also  * Atomic spies * Julius Rosenberg * Joel Barr Notes Sources * Steven T.

It is traditionally regarded as the site where what became the United States Marine Corps held its first recruitment drive during the American Revolution. It is also regarded as one of the \\"birthplaces of Masonic teachings in America\\".Sturkey, Marion F. (2001) Tun Tavern (excerpt from Warrior culture of the U.S. Marines, USMC Press). Retrieved 2008-09-02. History =Founding= The tavern was erected in 1686 at the intersection of King (later called Water) Street and Tun Alley by settler Joshua Carpenter, brother of Samuel Carpenter, a Quaker merchant who made a fortune trading in Barbados. Joshua Carpenter built the Tun on the caraway that led to Carpenter's Wharf. Tun Tavern was named for the Old English word \\"tun\\", meaning a barrel or keg of beer.Its name was occasionally written \\"Three Tons\\" and \\"Three Tuns\\" in the writings of J. Thomas Scharf and Thompson Westcott. 1884. History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co., Vol. I, pp. 203, 236. See also Harry Kyriakodis, Philadelphia's Lost Waterfront (The History Press, 2011) at 89-90, 95. In the 1740s, a restaurant appellation, \\"Peggy Mullan's Red Hot Beef Steak Club\\" was added to the name of the tavern.The restaurant was called \\"Peg Mullen's celebrated beef-steak and oyster house\\" in John F. Watson and Willis P. Hazard. 1909. Annals of Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania, Philadelphia: Leary, Stuart & Co., Vol. I, pp. 394-395, 464-465, 469; \\"Peg\\" was also rendered \\"Pegg\\" in contemporary works, but not \\"Peggy\\". =Organizations founded in the tavern= Tun Tavern hosted the first meetings of a number of organizations. In 1720, the first meetings of the St. George's Society (a charitable organization founded to assist needy Englishmen arriving in the new colony--predecessor of today's Sons of the Society of St. George) were held there. In 1732, the tavern hosted the first meetings of St. John's Lodge No. 1 of the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Temple. The Masonic Temple of Philadelphia recognizes Tun Tavern as the birthplace of Masonic teachings in America. In 1747, Tun Tavern became the founding place of the St. Andrew's Society, which like the St. George's Society, helped newly arrived Scottish. Tun Tavern was a significant meeting place for other groups and individuals. In 1756, Benjamin Franklin used the inn as a recruitment gathering point for the Pennsylvania militia as it prepared to fight Native American uprisings. The tavern later hosted a meeting of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Continental Congress. In October 1775 a seven man Naval Committee including John Adams appointed by Congress crafted articles of war to build America's first naval fleet. According to tradition, Tun Tavern was where the United States Marines held their first recruitment drive. On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress commissioned the innkeeper and former Quaker Samuel Nicholas to raise two battalions of Marines in Philadelphia. The tavern‚Äôs manager, Robert Mullan, was the \\"chief Marine Recruiter\\". Though legend places its first recruiting post at Tun Tavern, the historian Edwin Simmons surmises that it was more likely the Conestoga Waggon , a tavern owned by the Nicholas family. The first Continental Marine company was composed of one hundred Rhode Islanders commanded by Captain Nicholas. Each year on November 10, U.S. Marines worldwide toast the memory of this colonial inn as the officially-acknowledged birthplace of their service branch. The earliest Marines were deployed aboard Continental Congress Navy vessels as sharpshooters because they were typically recruited as outstanding marksmen. =Present day= In 1781, near the end of the American Revolution, Tun Tavern burned down. Its former structure stood at a location now occupied by Interstate 95, where it passes Penn's Landing. Tun Alley once existed between Walnut and Chestnut Streets east of Front Street. A commemorative marker on the east side of Front Street indicates the site, across from Sansom Walk. In homage to the likely 1775 Tun Tavern menu, the U.S. Marine Corps National Museum located in Quantico, Virginia, contains a Tun Tavern-themed restaurant, whose lunch menu features beer and other fermented (alcoholic) beverages, peanut soup and bread pudding, the non-alcoholic recipe of which remains a traditional staple among some U.S. Marine food services to this day.

The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific basin and June 1 in the central Pacific basin. Both basins' seasons ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone of the season was designated on May 30, and the final storm of the season, Hurricane Otis, dissipated on October 30. The season produced fifteen named storms and a total of eight hurricanes, which was near normal. However, the total of one major hurricane was below the average of three. The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Norma, which was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The storm caused six deaths ‚Äì five in Texas, and one in Mexico, due to severe flooding. Additionally, the storm caused $74 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage, which is credited to significant crop damage and many tornadoes. However, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season was Tropical Storm Lidia, which made two landfalls ‚Äì one on the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula and the other along the shores of Sinaloa in early October. As the result of its heavy rainfall in northwestern Mexico, seventy- three fatalities were reported, along with $80 million in damage.

However, two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific, Greg and Jova, entered the central Pacific, the latter entering as a hurricane. The season produced fifteen named storms and eight hurricanes; both of these numbers were equal to the average. The season's one major hurricane, a storm with winds of at least , was below the average of three. There are also at least two tropical depressions that did not strengthen into tropical storms. Six tropical cyclones made landfall in Mexico. First, Tropical Storm Adrian made landfall east-southeast of Acapulco, but did not cause any damage. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Irwin made landfall in Baja California Sur, but similarly to Adrian, did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Knut later made landfall near Mazatlan with winds equivalent to a minimal tropical storm, but no deaths or damage was reported. Tropical Storm Lidia struck about south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Heavy rainfall associated with the cyclone caused moderate damage in northwestern Mexico, and at least seventy- three deaths can be attributed to the storm. On May 30, an area of intense shower and thunderstorm activity located 270 mi (430 km) south of the Mexican coastline. The second to strike the area in 10 days, Norma was absorbed by a frontal system on October 14. The combined entity produced heavy rainfall and severe weather across Texas, which subsequently led to severe crop damage. The final storm to make landfall on Mexico during the 1981 season was Hurricane Otis. Intensifying into a hurricane by October 26, the hurricane brushed the coast of Jalisco before making landfall near Mazatlan at hurricane intensity on October 30. Otis was the second of two hurricanes to make landfall in the country this season. Systems =Tropical Storm Adrian= On May 30, an area of intense shower and thunderstorm activity located to the south of the Mexican coastline intensified into a tropical depression. Drifting towards the north and then east-northeast around an area of high pressure centered off the southern coast of Mexico, the depression began to strengthen over water. Twelve hours after formation, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Adrian. Reaching a peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h), Adrian began to move over slightly cooler ocean temperatures of and subsequently began to weaken. After being downgraded to a tropical depression by June 2, data from two cargo ships, the Androemda and Santa Maria, were helpful in locating Adrian's center of circulation as it moved towards the Mexican coastline. On June 4, the system made landfall east-southeast of Acapulco; however, no damage associated with the tropical cyclone was reported, and Adrian dissipated later that same day. =Hurricane Beatriz= On June 28, the season's second tropical depression formed approximately east of Clipperton Island. Moving quickly towards the west over warm sea-surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beatriz just twelve hours after formation. Embedded within an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, Beatriz attained hurricane status at 1800 UTC on June 30, and intensified further to attain its first brief peak at by early on June 1. Fluctuating in intensity, Hurricane Beatriz attained its peak intensity for a second time on June 2, only to enter an area of higher wind shear and cooler sea-surface temperatures. Far away from land, Beatriz was downgraded to a tropical storm on June 3, and then further into a tropical depression the following day. The tropical cyclone dissipated on July 4 while located several hundred miles to the west of Baja California Sur. Since Beatriz briefly posed a threat to Mexico and California, the Hurricane Hunters were put on standby, but no flights were made into the storm. The system did produce wave heights as high as to Southern California; however, impact from the storm was less than anticipated. =Tropical Storm Calvin= An area of disturbed weather located several hundred miles to the south of Acapulco organized into a tropical depression on July 4. Moving towards the west-northwest over warm sea-surface temperatures, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July 5, receiving the name Calvin. Reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) later that day, Calvin began to move north-northwest around the western periphery of a high pressure system located over extreme northern Mexico. Calvin then moved over cooler water and subsequently weakened to a minimal tropical storm. Located 98 mi (158 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 8, Calvin further weakened to a tropical depression and turned to the west. The system dissipated the following day. As a dying system, Calvin produced high clouds over California and Arizona. =Hurricane Dora= Based on satellite imagery and data from a nearby ship, Yamazuru, a tropical depression formed far away from land on July 10. Passing north of Clipperton Island, the depression began to strengthen under favorable atmospheric conditions, and was designated Tropical Storm Dora twelve hours after formation. Moving towards the west-northwest, Dora attained hurricane status on July 13; subsequently, the ship Amestelmolen reported seas of , a minimum barometric pressure of , and winds as it passed north of the storm's center. As Dora reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h) on June 14, a well-defined eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and the storm turned more towards the west. Cooler ocean temperatures below 74 ¬∞F (23 ¬∞C) subsequently caused the hurricane to weaken, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 15. The storm's structure further deteriorated the following day, and Dora dissipated over southwest of Cabo San Lucas, without affecting land. =Tropical Storm Eugene= Following Dora's dissipation, a new tropical depression formed west of the Mexican coastline. While retaining its intensity, the depression moved west-northwest before bending towards the southwest as it intensified into Tropical Storm Eugene on July 18. Above exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures of , Eugene slowly intensified. After passing south of Socorro Island, the storm accelerated west-northwest, reaching a peak intensity of early on June 19. Shortly thereafter, the system began to meander over cooler ocean temperatures, and weakened to a tropical depression on July 20. After changing little in intensity for nearly 24 hours, Eugene dissipated on July 21 while located west of the Baja California Peninsula, over water temperatures of . There were no reports of any effects attributed to the storm. =Hurricane Fernanda= Fernanda originated from an area of showers and thunderstorms that gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression on August 6\\\\. Moving rapidly towards the west, the system passed north of Clipperton Island. Above warm ocean temperatures, the depression strengthened to become a tropical storm twenty- one hours after formation, and after briefly turning towards the west- northwest, Fernanda attained hurricane status on August 9\\\\. A well-defined eye associated with the hurricane became visible, and the system reached its peak intensity as a 105 mph (165 km/h) Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale on August 10. Turning towards the northwest, Fernanda began to enter an area of cooler ocean temperatures and higher wind shear, subsequently weakening. On August 11, Fernanda was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, and then further to a tropical storm later that evening. By midday the following day, Fernanda had become a tropical depression, and dissipated early on August 13 without any effects on land. =Hurricane Greg= An area of intense thunderstorm activity left the southern coast of Mexico in mid-August. About south of Socorro Island, it formed on August 13. Over warm sea surface temperatures, the depression steadily intensified; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Greg at 1800 UTC. As the storm was moving on the southwest periphery of an area of high pressure, it curved west-northwest. Meanwhile, the storm passed south of Clarion Island at 2100 UTC on August 14. After turning toward the west, the storm's motion slowed. After maintaining its intensity while still a minimal tropical storm, Greg turned to the west-southwest for a day, only to resume its westerly course. As its speed increased a little, Greg gradually strengthened. Based on data from the ship Chapa, Greg was upgraded into a hurricane early on August 20. However, increased wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken back into a tropical storm. At this time, the tropical storm was located over water. Shortly thereafter, Greg moved into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility. It continued to weaken, and was only a minimal tropical storm by the afternoon of August 21. Although Greg weakened into a depression, it maintained a well-defined center of circulation for an additional 24 hours until dissipating at 1800 UTC on August 22 over east-northeast of Hawaii. =Hurricane Hilary= Based on a report from a cargo ship, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center upgraded a tropical disturbance into a tropical depression roughly west of the Mexican coast at 2105 UTC on August 21. Four hours later, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Hilary. After turning towards the west, it passed about south of Socorro Island. Even though Hilary developed a well-defined eye late on August 23, the cyclone was not upgraded into a hurricane until the next afternoon. Accelerating, Hilary reached its peak strength of 85 mph (140 km/h) while located west of Cabo San Lucas. Moving west, Hilary began to weaken over water. Late on August 28, nearly 24 hours following Hilary's downgrade into a tropical depression, the tropical cyclone dissipated far from land. =Tropical Storm Irwin= A tropical depression formed west of Acapulco on August 27. Over water, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irwin the next day. By August 25, Tropical Storm Irwin had peaked in intensity as a moderate tropical storm, then weakened as it moved over sea-surface temperatures. Less than southeast of Baja California, Irwin was downgraded into a depression. Turning west-northwest, Irwin made landfall about south of La Paz on August 30. After moving offshore the next day, Irwin dissipated. No damage was reported. =Hurricane Jova= Following two weeks of inactivity, a tropical depression formed at 1200 UTC September 14 while located in the middle of the Eastern Pacific. Above very warm ocean temperatures, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Jova six hours later. Jova rapidly intensified, and developed an eye late on September 15\\\\. Early on September 17, Jova peaked as a mid-level Category 1 hurricane. After briefly turning to the west-southwest, Jova turned back towards the west while weakened into a tropical storm. On September 19, the cyclone turned west-northwest, and dissipated about north of Hawaii on September 21. Due to its track just north of Hawaii and rapidly weakening in the Central Pacific, its only effect on the Hawaiian Islands was to disrupt the trade winds, leading to an increase in humidity. =Tropical Storm Knut= While Jova was weakening, a tropical disturbance formed within the Mexican coast. Moving west-northwest, a tropical depression formed on September 19, and became a tropical storm six hours later. Above sea surface temperatures, Knut continued to intensify. After turning north, Tropical Storm Knut reached its peak strength of 65 mph (120 km/h). Between a high-pressure area and a weak upper-level trough, Knut turned sharply to the east. After passing south of the Baja California Peninsula, the tropical storm weakened over cooler water. Knut dissipated as it made landfall in Mexico, at 1330 UTC on September 21. No damage was reported. =Tropical Storm Lidia= A tropical depression formed on October 6 ahead of a front; the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lidia on October 7. Lidia moved generally north, and reached its peak wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h). Despite encountering warm ocean temperatures, Lidia slowly weakened as it moved towards southern Baja California Peninsula. The tropical cyclone passed over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula on 1700 UTC October 7; at the time of the landfall Lidia was located about northwest of Cabo San Lucas. Two hours later, Lidia entered the Gulf of California, and turned to the northeast. Lidia made landfall on the shores of Sinaloa just south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The remnants of Lidia continued their northeast track, ultimately emerging into the Southern United States, bringing moisture to extreme southeastern Arizona. Heavy rain caused flooding that cut off seven towns in Sinaloa from the outside world. It also contaminated the water supply in Culiac√°n, leaving many without clean drinking water. Almost a hundred villages and two dams were flooded, The Rio Fuerte burst its banks and flooded sixty settlements. These rains sent water down a dry river bed, killing 40 people, mostly children. In one village, six soldiers died. In the northern part of Sinaloa, 42 were confirmed killed and 76 were missing. Around Los Mochis, four people were killed, where 800 houses were destroyed. In Culiac√°n, eleven people were killed. The total death toll from Tropical Storm Lidia was determined to exceed 73, which mostly occurred in rural areas. Losses to cattle, crops, and fishing vessels were more than $80 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, declared his state a disaster area. =Tropical Storm Max= On October 7, a tropical depression developed several hundred miles to the south of the Mexican coastline. Under favorable environmental conditions, the depression began to organize, and became a tropical storm twelve hours after formation, receiving the name Max. Moving north-northwestward, Max reached a peak intensity of briefly on October 9 before the system began to move into an area with cooler ocean temperatures and stronger wind shear. Early on October 10, Max weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated during the afternoon hours of the same day without any effects to land. =Hurricane Norma= Early on October 8, a tropical depression had developed far from land. Moving northwest, the storm intensified into Tropical Storm Norma at 0600 UTC. On 1800 UTC October 9, the EPHC upgraded the storm into a hurricane. Subsequently, Norma began to undergo a period rapid intensification; the storm soon reached major hurricane status. The storm reached its peak of 125 mph (205 km/h) at 1800 UTC on October 10. The storm began to accelerate while weakening. After briefly re-intensifying late on October 1, Hurricane Norma made landfall just northeast of Mazatlan with winds of 105 mph (155 km/h) at 1000 UTC on October 12. Although the storm quickly dissipated over land, a second area of low pressure formed over western Texas early on October 13 before the system itself was absorbed by a frontal system on October 14. Prior to landfall 5,000 people evacuated, thus only one deaths was reported (a fisherman drowned when his boat capsized in the storm). However, the hurricane caused more devastation in the flood- ravaged region. Agriculture was disrupted, and cattle were killed, causing at least $24 million (1981 USD) in crop damage. Torrential rains caused serious flooding north of Mazatlan. Five thousand two hundred residents need to be evacuated from low-lying areas. The remnants of the storm moved into Texas and Oklahoma. The heavy rainfall caused two rivers to reach flood-stage. A total of five people were killed in the United states, three of these deaths occurred in Fort Worth. During October 13 and 14, a total of 13 tornadoes were reported in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma, including a F2 tornado in McLennan that injured four people and caused $25 million in damage. In Oklahoma, 60 bridges were washed away due to flooding. Total damage in Texas was estimated at $50 million (1981 USD). =Hurricane Otis= On October 24, the season's last tropical cyclone developed to the south of the Mexican coastline. Moving towards the west-northwest, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Otis. Turning towards the north and eventually northeast, Otis steadily strengthened, and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane early on October 26. Sharply bending back towards the west-northwest, and eventually the north, Otis reached a peak intensity of before higher wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures began to impede on the system's organization. On October 29, Otis skirted the coast of Jalisco as a minimal Category 1 hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm. The next day, Otis made landfall near Mazatlan before being absorbed by a frontal system. =Other systems= Per the Japan Meteorological Agency, Typhoon Freda briefly existed in the basin as a dissipating tropical storm before being absorbed by another extratropical low on March 17, but the system isn't recognized by neither NHC nor CPHC. On August 4, a tropical depression developed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Despite being over warm sea surface temperatures, the depression dissipated the following day as wind shear began to significantly increase. Thus, the depression was never named, and never had any effects on land. Two weeks later, a tropical disturbance developed south-southeast of Socorro Island drifted north-northwest of a couple of days before organizing into a tropical depression a short distance southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Despite being located over warm sea surface temperatures, it failed to intensify. Tropical Depression Nine-E moved westward for 12 hours prior to dissipation. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1981. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for Fernanda, Hilary, and Norma which were previously used in the old four-year lists. No names were retired, so this list was used again in the 1987 season. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Adrian * Beatriz * Calvin * Dora * Eugene * Fernanda * Greg  * Hilary * Irwin * Jova * Knut * Lidia * Max * Norma  * Otis * Pilar (unused) * Ramon (unused) * Selma (unused) * Todd (unused) * Veronica (unused) * Wiley (unused) } In addition, 1981 was the first season in which the modern set of central Pacific hurricane naming lists was in effect, though no storms were named during the season.

It is in Ambassel, South Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, northwest of Dessie, at a latitude and a longitude of . Part of Ambassel woreda, Amba Geshen is one of the mountains of Ethiopia where most of the male heirs to the Emperor of Ethiopia were interned, usually for life. It was the second of the three such mountains, or amba, said to have been used for this purpose, the other two being Debre Damo and Wehni. History From some undetermined time, it was the practice that when the Ethiopian emperor assumed the throne, his brothers and other male relatives would be taken to a royal prison, where they would henceforth live until either they were called forth to become the new emperor or they died. Some traditions state this began during the Zagwe dynasty, others even earlier; the first certain mention of the practice was during the reign of Jin Asgad, who confined his brothers and his own sons to Amba Geshen. The use Amba Geshen as a prison was ended by Emperor Na'od, but Manoel de Almeida mentions that \\"those who were there before\\" were guarded until the reign of Emperor Gelawdewos, when only the descendants of Emperor Takla Maryam continued to be kept under watch because of their treachery against Emperor Baeda Maryam I.Translated in C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford, Some Records of Ethiopia: 1593-1646 (London: Hakluyt Society, 1954), pp. 101f Because it was a natural fortress, the Emperors also kept the imperial treasury there even after it was no longer a royal prison. The Muslims, under Ahmed Gragn, made several attempts to capture Amba Geshen: the Futuh al-Habasha describes the first (in November 1531) and second (in 1533); his final attempt in 1540 was successful, and he put the entire garrison and inhabitants to death.Sihab ad- Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), pp. 254-263; 342-346. Thomas Pakenham notes that contemporary Ethiopians believe that the True Cross was buried atop Amba Geshen by St Helena of Constantinople.Thomas Pakenham, The Mountains of Rasselas (New York: Reynal & Co., 1959), p. 156 Although the first European to mention Amba Geshen was Francisco √Ålvares, who witnessed an escaped prince being returned to Amba Geshen,Francisco Alvarez, The Prester John of the Indies translated by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961) the earliest European to accurately describe Amba Geshen was Almeida, who states it is :nearly round, though on top it appears to have the shape of a cross. Going along the edge of the rock, it is probably little more than half a league round on top, but one would have to walk for half a day to go round it on foot at the base. Its height is such that a stone thrown from a sling by a strong arm would reach from the bottom to the top with great difficulty. It is precipitous rock all round and in places it turns outward in such a way that it is impossible to get in. There is only one way in which... called Macaraquer.Beckingham and Huntingford, Some Records, pp. 97f Almeidez further writes that on top there was a natural pool and spring for water, and covered by kosso and zegba brush and wild cedars. He mentions two churches: Egzyabeher Ab, built by Emperor Lalibela, and Tekle Maryam, begun by Emperor Na'od but completed by his son, Lebna Dengel, which survived Ahmed Gragn's ravages.Beckingham and Huntingford, Some Records, pp. 98f However, when Pakenham visited Amba Geshen in 1955, he found that both churches had been rebuilt with tin roofs.Pakenham, Rasselas, p. 159 English literature Another inaccurate account of Amba Geshen, called Mount Amara, was published in Purchas, His Pilgrimage, which was believed by Pakenham to have inspired John Milton's description of Paradise in Paradise Lost,Pakenham, Rasselas, pp. 139f and later Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem Kubla Khan. In Samuel Johnson's Rasselas, the main character is a prince of Ethiopia who is interned in a mountain sanctuary called the \\"Happy Valley\\". To explore the world and find his own happiness, he escapes. Johnson's account was based on the travel account of Jer√≥nimo Lobo.

Although she is best known as the favourite model of √âdouard Manet, she was also an artist in her own right who regularly exhibited at the prestigious Paris Salon. In 1876 her paintings were selected for inclusion at the Salon's juried exhibition, when Manet's work was not. Biography Born in Paris to a family of artisans (her father was a patinator of bronzes, while her mother was a milliner), Meurent started modeling at the age of sixteen in the studio of Thomas Couture and may also have studied art at his women's atelier. Meurent first modeled for Manet in 1862, for his painting The Street Singer. Manet was first drawn to Meurent when he saw her in the street, carrying her guitar. She was particularly noticeable for her petite stature, which earned her the nickname La Crevette (The Shrimp),Ross King, The Judgement of Paris, p.37 and for her red hair, which is depicted as very bright in Manet's watercolor copy of Olympia. As well as playing the guitar, Meurent also played the violin, gave lessons in the two instruments, and sang in caf√©-concerts. Meurent's name remains forever associated with Manet's masterpieces of 1863, The Luncheon on the Grass and Olympia, which include nude portrayals of her. At that time she also modeled for Edgar Degas and the Belgian painter Alfred Stevens, both close friends of Manet. Her relationship with Stevens is said to have been particularly close. Manet continued to use Meurent as a model until the early 1870s, when she began taking art classes and they became estranged, as she was drawn to the more academic style of painting that Manet opposed. The last Manet painting in which Meurent appears is Gare Saint-Lazare (not to be confused with Monet's painting of the same name), painted in 1873, which is often referred to as The Railway. The painting is considered the best example of Manet's use of contemporary subject matter. Portrait, c. 1862 In 1875, Meurent began studying with the portraitist :fr:√âtienne Leroy. The following year, Meurent first submitted work of her own at the Salon and was accepted.Dictionnaire g√©n√©ral des artistes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise depuis l'origine des arts du dessin jusqu'√† nos jours : architectes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs et lithographes. p.80 Gallica BnF Manet's own submissions were rejected by the jury that year. Bourgeoise de Nuremberg au XVIe si√®cle,Salon des artistes fran√ßais 1879, no.2128; Gallica BnF Meurent's entry at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1879, was hung in the same room as the entry by Manet. Work by Meurent also was included in the 1885 and 1904 exhibitions. In all, Meurent exhibited in the Salon six times. She also continued to support herself by modelling through the 1880s for Norbert Goeneutte, an artist best known for his etchings, and for Toulouse-Lautrec, who took to introducing her as Olympia. Meurent was inducted into the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in 1903, with the support of Charles Hermann-Leon and Tony Robert-Fleury, the Soci√©t√©'s founder. By 1906 Meurent had left Paris for the suburb of Colombes, where she lived with a woman named Marie Dufour for the remainder of her life. The two appear to have shared ownership of their house. In her eighties she continued to refer to herself as an artist, as recorded in a census from that time. Meurent died on March 17, 1927. After the death of Dufour in 1930, the contents of the house were liquidated; in the late twentieth century, elderly neighbours recalled the last contents of the house, including a violin and its case, being burnt on a bonfire.  Paintings  Image:Le jour des rameaux.jpgPalm Sunday, c. 1880s, Mus√©e Municipal d'Art et d'Histoire de Colombes A painting by Meurent, Le Jour des Rameaux or Palm Sunday was recovered in 2004 and now hangs in the Colombes History Museum. In fiction Victorine Meurent's life has inspired two historical novels, and she appears as a character in several others. The Irish writer George Moore included Meurent as a character in his semi- fictional autobiography, Memoirs of My Dead Life (1906). She appears as a middle-aged woman, living in a lesbian relationship with a famous courtesan. Meurent is the protagonist of both Mademoiselle Victorine: a Novel (2007) by Debra Finerman and A Woman With No Clothes On (2008) by V R Main and is a character in Christopher Moore's novel Sacr√© Bleu (2012). She is also a character in the film Intimate Lives: The Women of Manet, aka Manet in Love (1998) and is played by Shelley Phillips. Another novel depicting Meurent and her relationship with Manet is Paris Red by Maureen Gibbon (2015).

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and central Pacific Ocean. This season was relatively uneventful; since no tropical cyclones made landfall, there were no reports of casualties or damage. Overall, the 1980 season was slightly below the long-term average, with 16 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 15 were named, 7 reached hurricane intensity, and only 3 became major hurricanes by attaining category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. All eastern Pacific systems this year formed in the eastern Pacific proper and two storms crossed into the central Pacific: Carmen from the west and Kay from the east. The season had an early start when Carmen crossed over the International Dateline in April. The strongest storm of this season is Hurricane Kay, peaking at . Kay lasted for fourteen and a half days, which was the fifth-longest lasting Pacific hurricane at the time. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:215 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/04/1980 till:11/11/1980 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/04/1980 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:04/04/1980 till:05/04/1980 color:TS barset:break from:07/04/1980 till:09/04/1980 color:TS text:\\"Carmen (TS)\\" from:09/06/1980 till:15/06/1980 color:C3 text:\\"Agatha (C3)\\" from:16/06/1980 till:19/06/1980 color:TS text:\\"Blas (TS)\\" from:17/06/1980 till:19/06/1980 color:TD text:\\"Three-E (TD)\\" from:25/06/1980 till:29/06/1980 color:C1 text:\\"Celia (C1)\\" from:01/07/1980 till:03/07/1980 color:TS text:\\"Darby (TS)\\" from:12/07/1980 till:13/07/1980 color:TS text:\\"Estelle (TS)\\" from:18/07/1980 till:22/07/1980 color:TS text:\\"Frank (TS)\\" barset:break from:28/07/1980 till:31/07/1980 color:C1 text:\\"Georgette (C1)\\" from:31/07/1980 till:07/08/1980 color:C2 text:\\"Howard (C2)\\" from:05/08/1980 till:11/08/1980 color:C2 text:\\"Isis (C2)\\" from:22/08/1980 till:29/08/1980 color:C3 text:\\"Javier (C3)\\" from:16/09/1980 till:30/09/1980 color:C4 text:\\"Kay (C4)\\" from:21/09/1980 till:25/09/1980 color:TS text:\\"Lester (TS)\\" from:11/10/1980 till:12/10/1980 color:TS text:\\"Madeline (TS)\\" from:28/10/1980 till:29/10/1980 color:TS text:\\"Newton (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/04/1980 till:01/05/1980 text:April from:01/05/1980 till:01/06/1980 text:May from:01/06/1980 till:01/07/1980 text:June from:01/07/1980 till:01/08/1980 text:July from:01/08/1980 till:01/09/1980 text:August from:01/09/1980 till:01/10/1980 text:September from:01/10/1980 till:01/11/1980 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" The 1980 Pacific hurricane season began on April 5, 1980, with the crossing of the dateline by Tropical Storm Carmen and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Newton on October 29. Of the sixteen tropical cyclones that in the eastern north Pacific Ocean during 1980, one was a tropical depression, eight were tropical storms, and seven were hurricanes, of which three were major hurricanes of Category or higher on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. Of these systems, all except one tropical storm formed east of 140¬∞W in the eastern Pacific proper. These totals are below the long term average of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. Two tropical cyclones existed in the central Pacific, both of which crossed in from other tropical cyclone basins. This total is below the average of four or five tropical cyclones per year. Systems =Tropical Storm Carmen= On April 4, a tropical depression formed just east of the International Date Line. At the time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated it tropical depression 02W. As it moved generally northwestwards, it strengthened into a tropical storm just before crossing the dateline, but only received a name in the northwest Pacific, being designated Carmen. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on April 6\\\\. Carmen recurved northeast and crossed the International Date Line, entering the central Pacific on April 7\\\\. The JTWC subsequently relinquished responsibility to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Carmen lost its initial motion and stalled in the area, ultimately weakening in to a tropical depression on April 8\\\\. The depression dissipated the following day and the remnant low returned to western Pacific. Tropical Storm Carmen caused no deaths or damages in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. It is the only known tropical cyclone in the central Pacific to exist in the month of April. In addition, it was the first northern hemisphere tropical cyclone to cross the dateline from west to east since Tropical Storm Virginia in 1968. =Hurricane Agatha= Agatha originated from a tropical depression that formed south-southwest of Acapulco on June 9\\\\. After becoming better organized, EPHC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm later that day, giving it the name Agatha. The storm turned north then northwest and strengthened into a hurricane. On June 12, Agatha reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. After entering an area with cooler sea surface temperature and stable air, Agatha steadily weakened into a tropical storm on June 13 and a tropical depression on June 14\\\\. The EPHC issued the last advisory on Agatha on the following day as Agatha rapidly dissipated. =Tropical Storm Blas= A disturbance south-southwest of Acapulco developed a circulation and was designated Tropical Storm Blas, skipping the depression stage. Blas headed northwest, and intensified, peaking in windspeed on June 16. The cyclone then steadily weakened, and dissipated on June 19, twelve hours after weakening into a tropical depression. =Tropical Depression Three= A disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on June 17. It moved northwest and then west, and never strengthened much. The tropical cyclone dissipated on June 19 after moving over cooler waters. It caused no known impact. =Hurricane Celia= A tropical disturbance moving west-northwestward organized into a tropical depression on June 25. It quickly became a tropical storm. Celia intensified into a hurricane on June 26 and peaked in intensity from June 26 to June 28. Celia then curved to the northwest as it wheeled around the edge of a ridge. Celia weakened into a tropical storm on June 28, a depression on June 29, and dissipated just after that. It remnants remained, and cloudiness and moisture associated with the cyclone were carried into the Continental United States by an upper-level trough. Celia\\"s remnants and moisture brought rain to Santa Barbara County, California, on the last two days of June. Other than that, Celia caused no impact. =Tropical Storm Darby= On July 1, a westward- moving tropical disturbance located to the southwest of Acapulco organized into a tropical depression. The next day, it intensified into a tropical storm as it briefly jogged to the north. Darby peaked in wind speed just after that. It then weakened into a depression on July 3 and dissipated later that day. Darby did not affect land, hence causing neither casualties or damage. =Tropical Storm Estelle= An area of disturbed weather developed gale-force winds and a cyclonic circulation, and was upgraded directly to tropical storm status on July 12. Estelle's winds peaked in velocity just after that. The cyclone then steadily weakened as it curved to the west northwest. Estelle dissipated on July 13. Estelle did not affect land. No damage or casualties were attributed to this tropical cyclone. =Tropical Storm Frank= A tropical disturbance northeast of Clipperton organized into a tropical depression on July 18. Heading northwestwards, it intensified into a tropical storm on July 20. Frank reached its maximum wind speed shortly after that. The cyclone then turned to the west and gradually weakened, dissipating on July 22. No reports of damage or casualties were attributed to Tropical Storm Frank. =Hurricane Georgette= A tropical disturbance formed southwest of Acapulco on July 26. The disturbance was then upgraded to a tropical depression on July 28. The cyclone headed northwest. It intensified into a tropical storm on July 29. That same day, Georgette was briefly a hurricane. The cyclone turned to the west and weakened, dissipating on July 31. Georgette did not affect land. Consequently, it caused no known impact. =Hurricane Howard= A tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on July 31. It headed west, and then gradually curved to the northwest as it paralleled the coast of Mexico. The cyclone became a storm shortly after forming, a hurricane on August 2, and peaked in windspeed on August 4. It then steadily weakened after that, and dissipated over cool waters shortly after becoming a tropical depression on August 7. Howard threatened the coasts of Southern California and the northern part of the Baja California Peninsula, but in the end never approached land. Hence, Howard caused no impact. =Hurricane Isis= A tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on August 5 and a tropical storm the next day. Isis headed generally west northwest and peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 8. Isis then weakened, becoming a tropical storm on August 10, turning to the west, and dissipating the next day. Isis never affected land, and for that reason it was responsible for no casualties or damage. =Hurricane Javier= An area of disturbed weather south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec became a tropical depression on August 22 and a storm the next day. Javier became a hurricane on August 24, and peaked as a major hurricane on August 25. Javier then weakened, becoming a tropical storm on August 27 and a storm the next day. It dissipated on August 29, having moved west-northwest for almost its entire life. Hurricane Javier had no impact on land. Consequently, no one was killed and nothing was damaged by this hurricane. =Hurricane Kay= A tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on September 16 and a tropical storm later that day. Kay headed in an irregular but generally west-northwest path out to sea. Kay strengthened into a hurricane on September 17. It continued strengthening and reached its peak as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on September 18. Kay then slowly weakened, and was a tropical storm by September 20. Kay's forward motion slowed as it neared the central Pacific. It restrengthened into a hurricane on September 23, and crossed 140¬∞W and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility the next day. Kay executed a small anticyclonic loop, and then began weakening again. It became a tropical storm again on September 27, and a depression two days later. The cyclone dissipated on September 30 while located north of the Hawaiian Islands. Kay had no effect on land, causing no damage or casualties. It was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season at . Kay lasted for 14.5 days, enough to make it the fifth-longest lasting Pacific hurricane at the time. =Tropical Storm Lester= A westward-moving disturbance south of Acapulco strengthened into a tropical depression on September 21. Continuing on its path, it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester on September 23. Lester's motion then slowed down, and it spun about in the open ocean until it dissipated on September 25, having never affected land. =Tropical Storm Madeline= A disturbance east of Clipperton became a tropical depression and then a tropical storm. It headed northwest and weakened into a depression on October 12. It dissipated shortly after that. Because Tropical Storm Madeline did not come near land, it caused no known damages or casualties. =Tropical Storm Newton= An area of disturbed weather southeast of Socorro Island became a tropical storm on October 28. It headed northeast and approached the coast of Mexico. However, an area of high wind shear and cool waters destroyed the cyclone on October 29, before it could reach the coast. Newton was the tropical cyclone that came closest to making landfall this season. No impact was reported. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1980. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1986 season. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for Agatha, Estelle, Georgette and Madeline, which were previously used in the old four-year lists. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Agatha * Blas * Celia * Darby * Estelle * Frank * Georgette  * Howard * Isis * Javier * Kay * Lester * Madeline * Newton    * } In contrast to previous years, where tropical cyclones forming in the central Pacific received names from the western Pacific naming lists, a separate set of five central Pacific hurricane naming lists were created for the 1980 season. The list used for the 1980 season was intended to be reused for the 1985 season. However, as no storms formed in the central Pacific in 1980, these five naming lists were scrapped and replaced with the modern set of central Pacific naming lists for the following season. The first name to be used on the modern lists was Akoni in the 1982 season. { width=\\"90%\\"   *   *   * } See also *List of Pacific hurricanes *Pacific hurricane season *1980 Atlantic hurricane season *1980 Pacific typhoon season *1980 North Indian Ocean cyclone season *Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons: 1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81 References External links * Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones of 1980 * CPHC Season Summary * Unisys Weather archive for the Eastern Pacific, 1980 * ATCR archive for Tropical Storm Carmen Category:Pacific hurricane seasons Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines 1980 EPAC ","title":"1980 Pacific hurricane season"},{"id":"2188170","text":"Max Littmann (3 January 1862 ‚Äì 20 September 1931) was a German architect.

In 1885, he moved to Munich where he met Friedrich Thiersch and Gabriel von Seidl and where - after two study trips to Italy and Paris - he established himself as a free architect. In 1891, he joined the contracting business of his father-in-law Jakob Heilmann, thus transforming it into the Heilmann & Littmann general partnership (later becoming a limited partnership), taking charge of the planning department. Littmann excelled in the erection of magnificent buildings, e. g. theaters, department stores and spas and was the perfect supplement to Heilmann, who had specialized in living house construction. Even during his lifetime, Littmann was listed in the Encyclopaedia Judaica. His pedigree doesn't give any clue on the often referred Jewish descent, rather he is descended from a Protestant family in Oschatz (Saxony), which can be traced back for centuries.

The Child Catcher is employed by Baron Bomburst and Baroness Bomburst to snatch and imprison children on the streets of Vulgaria. In the film, the Child Catcher was played by ballet dancer Robert Helpmann. Whilst filming one of the scenes where the Child Catcher drives his horse and carriage out of the village, the carriage tipped over as it turned a corner with Helpmann on board. Dick Van Dyke recalls Helpmann, with great presence of mind, swinging out of the carriage and skipping across the crashing vehicle to safety. Van Dyke later commented that he had never seen anything as graceful in his life. Helpmann was 60 years old at the time. The Child Catcher does not appear in Fleming's original book. Reputedly, Roald Dahl (co-author of the film's screenplay) created the character. Dahl's screenplay was heavily rewritten by Ken Hughes, the director, who said he had created the character. In the theatrical version in London's West End, he has been played by Richard O'Brien, Wayne Sleep (another ballet dancer), and Stephen Gately amongst others and on Broadway, he was played by Kevin Cahoon. In the Australian theatrical version, he was played by Tyler Coppin who wrote and performs a solo show about Robert Helpmann called LyreBird (Tales of Helpmann). In 2005, the Child Catcher was voted \\"the scariest villain in children's books\\". In 2008, Entertainment Weekly called Helpmann's depiction of the Child Catcher one of the \\"50 Most Vile Movie Villains.\\" References Category:Chitty Chitty Bang Bang characters Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Film characters introduced in 1968 Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Male film villains Category:Male characters in film ","title":"Child Catcher"},{"id":"2188176","text":"Harlan True Stetson (1885-1964) was an American astronomer and physicist.

In 1765, Germain broke guild regulations by working with financiers to receive some debts owed to him, as he was only allowed to enter into partnerships with his fellow smiths. For this he was forced to resign his position and declare bankruptcy. Germain died out of the public eye in 1791, the last member of his distinguished family to serve as a royal smith. Many of his works are now held in museums and private collections. Curiously enough, due to the French Revolution and other hazards of history, the biggest portion of his production now belongs to countries other than France--namely Portugal and Russia. In popular culture Germain is portrayed as a Templar Grand Master, and the main antagonist, in the 2014 video game Assassin's Creed Unity. Instead of dying in 1791, he is killed off by the game's protagonist in 1794.

These ads are designed by political consultants and political campaign staff. Many countries restrict the use of broadcast media to broadcast political messaging. In the European Union, many countries do not permit paid-for TV or radio advertising for fear that wealthy groups will gain control of airtime, making fair play impossible and distorting the political debate in the process. In both the United Kingdom and Ireland, paid advertisements are forbidden, though political parties are allowed a small number of party political broadcasts in the run up to election time. The United States has a very free market for broadcast political messaging. Canada allows paid-for political broadcasts but requires equitable access to the airwaves. Campaigns can include several different media (depending on local law). The time span over which political campaign advertising is possible varies greatly from country to country, with campaigns in the United States lasting a year or more to places like the UK and Ireland where advertising is restricted by law to just a short period of weeks before the election. Social media has become very important in political messaging, making it possible to message larger groups of constituents with very little physical effort or expense, but the totality of messaging through these channels is often out of the hands of campaign managers. History Political advertising has changed drastically over the last several decades. In his campaign for the 1948 United States presidential election, Harry S. Truman was proud of his accomplishment of shaking approximately 500,000 hands and covering 31,000 miles of ground across the nation. But that accomplishment was soon to pale in comparison when in 1952, the 1952 United States presidential election saw a major change in how candidates reached their potential audiences. With the advent of television, war hero and presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower, created forty twenty-second television spot commercials entitled, \\"Eisenhower Answers America\\" where he answered questions from \\"ordinary\\" citizens in an attempt to appear accessible to \\"the common man\\". These questions were filmed in one day using visitors to Radio City Music Hall, who were filmed gazing up at Eisenhower as he answered questions about the Korean War, government corruption, and the state of the economy. He did not have to shake a half a million hands or travel the country extensively. He won the trust of the American people with his direct approach and subsequently the Presidential election. His vice president was Richard M. Nixon. In the 1960 United States presidential election, Vice President Nixon used a formal television address in his presidential campaign, designed to answer questions about The Cold War and government corruption, and to show Americans that he was the stronger, more experienced candidate. On the other side of the fence, Catholic born John F. Kennedy created approximately 200 commercials during his campaign, but there were two that made Nixon‚Äôs efforts futile. The first was a thirty-minute commercial created from a speech he delivered in Houston, where he called for religious tolerance in response to criticism that Catholicism was incompatible with a run for the Oval Office. The second and more memorable was the first Kennedy-Nixon debate. In the first of four televised debates, Kennedy appeared tanned and confident in opposition to Nixon, who looked pale and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Seventy-five million viewers watched the debates, and although Nixon was initially thought to be the natural successor to Eisenhower, the election results proved otherwise, and Kennedy was ultimately declared the winner. In the 1964 United States presidential election, aggressive advertising paved the way for a landslide victory for Lyndon B. Johnson. One of the first negative and maybe the most controversial commercial, perhaps of all time, was an advertisement dubbed \\"The Daisy Girl.\\" The commercial showed a young girl picking the petals off a daisy. After she finishes counting, a voice off camera begins a countdown to a nuclear explosion. The ad ends with an appeal to vote Johnson, \\"because the stakes are too high for you to stay home.\\" The commercial used fear and guilt, an effective advertising principle, to make people take action to protect the next generation. The ad ran for under a minute and only aired once, but due to the right wing, pro-war views of Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate, it resulted in a 44 to 6 state victory for Lyndon B. Johnson. Over the next decade, the United States saw the rise of the televised political attack ad. Richard M. Nixon was especially proficient at this form of advertising, and his commercials proved to be very successful in his reelection campaign during the 1972 United States presidential election, where he won handily with a 49 to 1 state victory. George McGovern ran a campaign free of political attack ads until the very end of his campaign, when he tried to attack Nixon after he realized he was dipping lower in the polls. His attempt proved to be too late, but his neutral style of attack ads against Nixon, featuring white text scrolling across a black background, became what is now seen as a fairly common method used in political and product advertising. Attack ads continued to become the norm in political advertising. Ronald Reagan used them against Jimmy Carter during the 1980 United States presidential election. It was also the first time that a family member was also used to attack the opposing candidate. One particular advertisement showed Nancy Reagan (Reagan‚Äôs wife) accusing Carter of a weak foreign policy. This campaign also saw the rise of campaign finance issues when Reagan used political action committees to solicit funds on his behalf. However, in Reagan's reelection bid during the 1984 United States presidential election, the United States experienced the beginning of a different form of political advertising; one with a much more positive flow and a stronger, more powerful message. With the country in a relatively prosperous state, advertisements in support of Reagan evoked an emotional bond between the country and its president. Visions of Americans going about their daily lives with relative ease were compiled to convince America that voting against Reagan was a vote against prosperity. The positive and emotionally provocative ads proved more successful than negative attack ads. He was so highly successful that he won against Walter Mondale with a 49 to 1 state victory. In the 1988 United States presidential election, attack ads returned with a renewed vigor. George H.W. Bush used campaign ads that ridiculed his opponent Michael Dukakis, making him appear soft on crime.Simon, Roger (November 11, 1990). \\"How A Murderer And Rapist Became The Bush Campaign's Most Valuable Player\\". The Baltimore Sun. He contrasted these negative ads, with the emotional style commercial used by Ronald Reagan, to capitalize on his connection to the former president. Again borrowing from Reagan's campaign practices he used free publicity as often as possible, making sure he was photographed in various situations that were likely to be aired in the evening news. Although Michael Dukakis tried to discredit the Bush campaign in many ways, he was ultimately unsuccessful, losing to the former Vice President by thirty states. ''' In modern times, elections have not only been manipulated by campaign ads, but by other factors as well. Social media has been one of the biggest components of what makes up modern campaigns. One very potent factor is what are called internet memes. This method may have some form of control from the candidate, but just like almost all social media, the end results are often not in the hands of the candidate. These internet memes were once known to be simple little images with jokes but now have become means of transmitting political opinions, beliefs, and thoughts on our society. One very recent, high-profile example is the 2016 presidential election. According to a recent study conducted by Forbes, political memes containing the word ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù (the political campaign slogan of presidential candidate Donald Trump ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù) went from being mentioned once in January 2016, to 12,294 times in January 2017 with a 1,224,800% increase. Compared to other trends during that same period, it was one of the biggest growing tendencies. This also goes to show how such methods of political attack have changed and adapted so quickly. Internet memes also tend to favor a certain political candidate or party over another. In the same study, it was found that as the 2016 election date neared, there were more Internet political memes featuring presidential candidate Donald Trump than candidate Hillary Clinton. This indeed give Trump a free attention boost considering how such memes spread easily and fast across social media platforms in modern times. Also in general, it was shown as well that these memes tend to be ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù conservative and such memes have also been seen to increase in a far more dramatic manner than such ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù memes. These new kinds of modern political cartoons are taking the world by storm as a new way of influencing political campaigns on the basis that they either glorify or demonize a specific candidate or party and spread this to a very large audience with little to no use of campaign funds.  Regulation  Candidate placards in New Hampshire, 2013 Political advertising truck in India, 2014 2013 Chilean general election for Michelle Bachelet Advert for the Liberal Party of Australia, 2010 =United States of America= While there have been some increases in regulation of campaign finance in the United States, there is generally little regulation of political advertising content. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 addressed the issue of \\"soft money\\" or money contributed through political action committees, raised the legal limits of hard money that could be raised for any candidate, and set limits on what funds could be spent on election broadcasts, but it did not mandate verifiability in political campaign advertising. As of this time, there is no pending legislation addressing this issue. Currently the Federal Communications Commission requires that the contracts for political ads shown on broadcast stations be posted online, but the agency is considering a proposal to expand that disclosure requirement to other platforms, including radio and cable. =European Union= In most EU Member States, campaign advertising is heavily regulated. In some Member States, the United Kingdom and Ireland for example, party political advertisements on broadcast media (known as Party Political Broadcasts) are restricted to specific circumstances such as political party conferences and a limited time period before a General Election. In the latter instance political parties are allowed specific time slots on the broadcast media in which the advert may be aired. These are limited in time, offered to all registered parties and must be aired at times during the schedules that have similar levels of viewership. Furthermore, a moratorium on all election coverage is mandated on the day of the ballot.Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, Broadcasting Code on Referenda and Election Coverage pursuant to the Broadcasting Act 2009 Some Member States regulate the posting of election posters at both national and municipal level. In Ireland there are restrictions on the erection of election posters which mandate the time period after an election by which time the poster must be removed, with fines as a potential sanction. Some local councils have voted to ban the placement of election posters, citing the cost of removal and the waste generated. Many municipalities in France restrict the placement of election posters to specific areas, often erecting stands specifically for that purpose. =Turkey= Campaign advertisement for all elections is heavily regulated in Turkey through The 1961 Law on Basic Provisions on Elections and Voter Registers (Law on Basic Provisions). The Turkish Constitution reformed under coup d'√©tat regime in 1982, contains a number of restrictions to fundamental civil and political rights directly affecting the conduct of elections. The Law on Presidential Elections (LPE), adopted in January 2012, (following the constitutional referendum in 2007 that changed the indirect presidential election system to a direct election of the president by popular vote with an absolute majority of valid votes) regulates aspects of the new presidential election system. It was adopted in an expedited manner with limited debate and no public consultation nor support of opposition parties. OSCE stated in their election report that LPE and Law on Basic Provisions are not harmonized and LPE lacks clarity. Regulation of political advertising =European Union= In contrast to advertising in the print, radio and internet media, many Member States of the European Union have consistently restricted advertising on broadcast media which are aimed at political ends, both party political advertising and political advocacy by non-partisan groups. These restrictions have been justified on the basis that the ban offers a level playing field in which money interests cannot gain an unfair advantage in the political discourse of a Member State. The broadcast media has been singled out due to its historical reach and influence. Outright bans on advertising engaged in political advocacy have been referred to the European Court of Human Rights which has held that such restrictions may be a breach of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. but the Court has held that restrictions on political advertising can be justified in certain circumstances, provided they were proportionate to the public interest they aimed to protect. Certain Member States including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland have repeatedly refused to remove their blanket bans. An attempted television ad campaign by the Association against Industrial Animal Production (VGT) which drew a comparison between battery farming and the Holocaust was persistently refused in line with Swiss law, and was the subject of two ECtHR cases, the second case resulting from the persistent refusal by Switzerland to modify its laws on political advertising. However, in a similar UK case involving Animal Rights advertising, the Court upheld the UK ban on political advertising on several grounds. It held the UK had consulted widely before legislating, the court recognized the legitimacy of limiting political advertising on television, acknowledging the argument that there was a \\"risk of distortion\\" of public debate by wealthy groups having unequal access to advertising, and accepted that the ban was not a ban on free speech given that other methods of communication were available. The court thus recognized that television advertising is especially powerful and thus wealthy groups could block out the valid arguments of less wealthy groups and thus distort public debate. =India= Campaigning is done through medias, newspapers and radios. By ruling of The Cable Television Network Rules of 1994, political advertisements were prohibited. However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2004 dictated that one may apply for an advertisement to be displayed on TV, but it must be approved by a committee created by the Chief Electoral Officer; the committee consists of The Joint Chief Electoral Officer, a Returning Officer, and one expert. Additionally, the committee will only consider advertisements from registered political parties or groups or organizations whose headquarter are in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. This model was also spread to other states; they are to have a committee consisting of a Joint Chief Electoral Officer, a Returning Officer, and one expert. Just as with Delhi, the other territories are to consider applications from registered political parties or groups or organizations whose headquarter are in the territory. In all cases, the Returning Officer is the one who considers applications for advertisements. Additionally, there is a committee within every state, designated by The Chief Electoral Officer, to handle and complaints. This committee consists of The Chief Electoral Officer, an observer, and an expert. In addition to these 2004 decisions, it was decided in 2007 that these procedures would be extended national parties for the elections in the states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. The parties are not permitted to take funds from corporate houses and the funds of the parties are non- taxable. The election commission which conducts the election sets out the rules and regulations for every election and enforces these rules as well. For example, all political parties have to stop campaigning forty eight hours before the election. Similarly politicians facing criminal charges are often disqualified and communal content in speeches are also not permitted. =Japan= Japan distinguishes between party advertisements and candidate advertisements. There are few restrictions on political advertisements made by parties. One restriction is that party advertisements cannot mention specific candidates.Christensen, Ray. \\"The Rules of the Election Game in Japan.\\" Party Politics in Japan: Political Chaos and Stalemate in the 21st Century. Hrebenar, Ronald A., and Nakamura, Akira, eds. Routledge, 2014. Candidate advertisements have greater limitations and are paid for by the government. Candidates are not allowed to purchase their own advertisements. The number and type of candidate advertisements are also limited, including the size of newspaper advertisements, and length of television and radio advertisements.Akuto, Hiroshi. \\"Media and Electoral Campaigning in Japan and the United States.\\" Media and Politics in Japan. Krauss, Ellis S., and Pharr, Susan J., eds. University of Hawaii Press, 1996. Japanese election law discourages negative campaign advertising directed at other candidates, parties, or political organizations.Kaid, Lynda Lee, and Christina Holtz- Bacha. The Sage handbook of political advertising. Sage Publications, 2006. Campaign advertisements can only be broadcast during the two-week official campaign period and are closely monitored for violations of election law. =Australia= Australia has five advertising campaign principles. First, campaigns should be relevant to government responsibilities. Secondly, campaign materials in advertising should be presented in an objective, fair and accessible manner and be designed to meet the objectives of the campaign. Facts presented should be accurate and verifiable. The third principle states that campaign materials should be objective and not directed at promoting party interests. Campaign materials must not mention the party in government by name, or directly attack or scorn the views, policies, or actions of others. Fourth, campaigns should be justified and undertaken in an efficient, effective and relevant manner. The last principle states that campaigns must comply with legal requirements and procurement policies and procedures. This is particularly important in respecting laws with broadcasting and media.\\"Short-term Interim Guidelines on Information and Advertising Campaigns by Australian Government Departments and Agencies.\\" Australian Government Department of Finance. Commonwealth of Australia, June 2014. Web. 27 Oct. 2014. When broadcasting political advertisements during an election period, the broadcaster must give all parties contesting the election a reasonable opportunity to have election matter broadcast during the election period. This does not need to be done for free. Sponsors or current affair programs must be identified during political advertising. While Australia does not exactly have a right to free speech, they have an implied freedom of political communication. There are regulations on the format and presentation of political advertising, but little regulation on the content.\\"Campaign Finance: Australia.\\" Library of Congress Home. Library of Congress, 16 Sept. 2014. Web. 27 Oct. 2014. =Iran= Iran's democratically elected president, Hassan Rouhani, is the current leader of Iran's quasi-theocratic government. The country is made up of mainly Shiite Muslims and a small minority of Sunni Muslims. The history of censorship in Iranian political advertising and campaign tactics has followed the ebb and flow of the country's religiously conservative state, dating back to the birth of the Islamic regime during the Iranian Revolution of 1979. One of the most recent examples of this censorship dates back to 2007, when Iran's \\"fundamentalist-based parliament\\" passed legislation that severely restricted the content and presentation of political advertising. The restrictions limited candidates in the presidential election from displaying posters, especially with their own image on them, and greatly limited the use of other publicity tools in an effort to urge candidates to give their messages through government organizations. Critics suggest that this limitation of advertising venue and medium was an attempt by the state to keep standing politicians in office and limit the information available on new candidates. Outside reports from more recent elections and campaigns claim actions such as physical attacks on journalists and campaign heads by unknown parties and the modification of campaign websites and documentaries by state agencies. =Argentina= Argentina passed regulations on the allocation of television and radio campaigns in preparation for the 2013 primary and legislative elections. The regulation divides programming into 4 blocks throughout the day and allocates a certain percentage of time during the slots for campaign advertisement. For television during the blocks from 7‚Äì11am and from 4‚Äì8pm, 30% percent of the time will be allocated to campaign advertisement. For the slots from 11am‚Äì4pm and 8pm‚Äì1am, 20% percent of the time will be allocated for campaign advertisement. For radio the percentage of allocation during these 4 time blocks is flipped, 11am‚Äì4pm and 8pm‚Äì1am receiving 30% of the time for campaign advertisement, and 20% for the 7‚Äì11am and 4‚Äì8pm time blocks. =South Africa= Independent Communication Authority of South Africa (ICASA) established in 2000 is the regulatory body of broadcast political advertisements. It also serves to protect the message of the political advertisement from the broadcasting service. ICASA's regulations dictate the nature and acceptable content for aired political advertisements. Political party advertisements may only be authorized to be broadcast during the period of elections. A broadcasting service that airs a licensed ad must clearly state that this is in fact a political advertisement. The commercial cannot be longer than 1 minute in duration and cannot exceed 8 time slots within the designated period of elections. There is a required screening process of all political advertisements before being national redistributed. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in maximum fine of one million Rand. =Russia= Russia, as well as many other countries, does not have a legal definition of \\"political advertising\\". Current Russian legislation regulates the form of political advertising such as election campaigns. This form involves activities to disseminate information about political forces and candidates to influence voting behaviour. Election campaign is defined as paid by a candidate, an electoral association, or other person acting in the interest of the candidate messages and materials, which encourage citizens to make the proposed action. Political advertising in a broad sense is not regulated by a special law and follows the general rules governing freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of association. Lack of legal definition of political advertising leads to the ambiguity of its understanding, which generates conflict situations in legal relations of advertising. Moreover, this kind of advertising in Russia has evolved relatively recently, because from 1917 to 1991 there was only one political force in the country, which had no political opponents, and used ideological propaganda as the primary means of political communication. =Canada= According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the key role of broadcasters is to inform potential voters on issues, political parties and candidates during an election period. This means ensuring equitable airtime for all candidates on each broadcast network. 6.5 hours of prime programing should be available for the purchase by all parties. On-air personalities running as a candidate in a provincial or federal election are required halt any on-air duties as soon as his or her candidacy is announced or the election is called. According to Elections Ontario, there are restrictions regarding when political advertising may be aired and restrictions on the rates broadcasters and publishing facilities can charge for said advertising. Effects of political advertising Political science research generally finds negative advertisement (which has increased over time) to be ineffective both at reducing the support and turnout for the opponent. According to political scientists Stephen Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar, negative ads do succeed at driving down overall turnout though. They also find that \\"negative ads work better for Republicans than for Democrats, and better for men than for women; unfortunately, negative ads also work better in general than positive ones\\". Challengers who spend more time campaigning get a higher vote share against incumbents in state house elections. According to political scientist Lynn Vavreck, \\"the evidence suggests that campaign ads have small effects that decay rapidly‚Äîvery rapidly‚Äîbut just enough of the impact accumulates to make running more advertising than your opponent seem a necessity\\". Her study with Alexander Coppock and Seth J. Hill, which tested 49 political advertisements in 59 experiments on 34,000 people found that the effects of advertising on persuasion were small regardless of context, message, sender, or receiver. President Reagan giving Campaign speech in Austin, Texas, 1984 Direct effects of political campaign advertising include informing voters about candidates' positions and affecting the \\"preferences and participatory ethos of the electorate\\". Studies show that voting results are affected by voters' characteristics and the type of ad to which they are exposed. Both positive and negative advertisement have been proven to play different roles in regards to candidate evaluation. Positive ads, which usually start at the beginning of a campaign aim at introducing or reintroducing a candidate through reinforcing his or her positive image and qualities. Whereas a strictly political advertisement would inform the viewer, positive campaign ads become an ongoing discussion of character‚Äîpeople understand more than simply just political identity. In an analysis of the dynamics that exist in campaign advertising, Jim Granato and M.C. Sunny Wong argue that \\"Not only do voters associate a candidate with a particular party and its policies, but they also assess character and competence of a candidate.\\" Instead of simply representing a candidate by their issues, a candidate is almost created as a character on the screen. These campaigns become affirmations of competency; they give the viewer a multi-faceted understanding of who the candidate is and who the candidate is trying to portray themselves as. Negative or attack ads have been studied for their effects on memory and ability to shape attitude towards candidates. Both variables are measured to determine the effectiveness of negative ads, which tend to be well remembered. The limitation of this technique is that it can sometimes be highly counterproductive as ads turn out to harm the attacking candidate. One other effect of political campaign advertising includes greater attitude polarization among voters. In fact one study conducted by Gina Garramone on the effects of political advertising on the political process shows that \\"by discerning clear differences between candidates, voters may be more likely to strongly like one candidate while strongly disliking the other\\". This typically leads to higher levels of confidence within voters choices and can widen the degree of participation in the electoral process. =Chile= One of the most historically effective and unprecedented uses of campaign advertising took place in Chile in the year 1988. Chile's president, General Augusto Pinochet, who was notorious for ordering the torture and killing of political enemies, decided to issue a referendum in which the Chilean people could vote \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" on the continuation of his regime. Overconfident in the idea that the majority of Chileans viewed him as a benevolent leader, Pinochet allowed his opposition fifteen minutes of airtime on the national television station each day for the twenty-seven days preceding the October 5 referendum. A creative team composed of Eugenio Garc√≠a, Francisco Celed√≥n, and other members of Chile's Christian Democratic Party undertook the effort to air a hard-hitting and impactful political ad campaign against Pinochet. This campaign differed from many others in that it lacked a candidate or central ideology around which to base itself. However, instead of using negative attack ads, the campaign's creators decided to imbue their advertisements with a sense of joy, or \\"alegr√≠a\\". The campaign was overwhelmingly successful; 7.2 million votes were cast, with 3.96 million opposing the Pinochet regime. Pinochet stepped down peacefully in the year 1990, passing on leadership to a democratic civilian government. The results for this election were believed to have large-scale effects for worldwide democracy.

It was the second instance of nuclear testing conducted by India; the first test, code-named Smiling Buddha, was conducted in May 1974. The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. The then Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission described each one of the explosions of Pokhran-II to be \\"equivalent to several tests carried out by other nuclear weapon states over decades\\". Subsequently, India established computer simulation capability to predict the yields of nuclear explosives whose designs are related to the designs of explosives used in this test. Pokhran-II consisted of five detonations, the first of which was a fusion bomb while the remaining four were fission bombs. The tests were initiated on 11 May 1998, under the assigned code name Operation Shakti, with the detonation of one fusion and two fission bombs. On 13 May 1998, two additional fission devices were detonated, and the Indian government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee shortly convened a press conference to declare India a full-fledged nuclear state. The tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major states, including Japan and the United States. Many names have been assigned to these tests; originally these were collectively called Operation Shakti‚Äì98, and the five nuclear bombs were designated Shakti-I through to Shakti-V. More recently, the operation as a whole has come to be known as Pokhran II, and the 1974 explosion as Pokhran-I.  India's nuclear bomb project  Efforts towards building the nuclear bomb, infrastructure, and research on related technologies have been undertaken by India since World War II. Origins of India's nuclear program date back to 1944 when nuclear physicist Homi Bhabha began persuading the Indian Congress towards the harnessing of nuclear energy‚Äî a year later he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). In 1950s, the preliminary studies were carried out at the BARC and plans were developed to produce plutonium and other bomb components. In 1962, India and China engaged in the disputed northern front, and was further intimidated with a Chinese nuclear test in 1964. Direction towards militarisation of the nuclear program slowed down when Vikram Sarabhai became its head and little interest of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1965. After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1966, the nuclear program was consolidated when physicist Raja Ramanna joined the efforts. Another nuclear test by China eventually led to India's decision toward building nuclear weapons in 1967 and conducted its first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, in 1974. = Post-Smiling Buddha = Responding to Smiling Buddha, the Nuclear Suppliers Group severely affected India's nuclear program. The world's major nuclear powers imposed technological embargo on India and Pakistan, which was technologically racing to meet with India's achievement. The nuclear program struggled for years to gain credibility and its progress was crippled by the lack of indigenous resources and dependence on imported technology and technical assistance. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared to the IAEA that India's nuclear program was not militarising despite authorising preliminary work on the hydrogen bomb design. In the aftermath of the state emergency in 1975 that resulted in the collapse of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government, the nuclear program was left with a vacuum of political leadership and even basic management. Work on the hydrogen bomb design continued under M. Srinivasan, a mechanical engineer, but progress was slow. The nuclear program received little attention from Prime Minister Morarji Desai who was renowned for his peace advocacy. In 1978, Prime Minister Desai transferred physicist Ramanna to Indian MoD, and his government once again accelerated India's nuclear program. Shortly thereafter, the world discovered the Pakistan's clandestine atomic bomb program. Contrary to India's nuclear program, Pakistan's atomic bomb program was akin to United States Manhattan Project, in that it was under military oversight with civilian scientists in charge of the scientific aspects of the program. The Pakistan's secretive atomic bomb program was well funded and organised by then; India realised that Pakistan was likely to succeed in its project in matter of two years. In 1980, the general elections marked the return of Indira Gandhi and the nuclear program began to gain momentum under Ramanna in 1981. Requests for additional nuclear tests continued to be denied by the government after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw Pakistan begin engaging in brinkmanship, though the nuclear program continued to advance. Work towards the hydrogen bomb, as well as the launch of the missile programme, began under Dr. Abdul Kalam, who was then an aerospace engineer.  Political momentum: 1988‚Äì1998  During the 1998 Indian general election, BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee promised to carry out nuclear tests. In 1989, the general elections witnessed the Janata Dal party led by V.P. Singh, forming the government. Prime Minister V.P. Singh downplayed the relations with the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto whose Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won the general elections in 1988. Foreign relations between India and Pakistan severely worsened when India accused Pakistan of supporting the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. During this time, the Indian Missile Program succeeded in the development of the Prithvi missiles. Successive governments in India decided to observe this temporary moratorium for fear of inviting international criticism. The Indian public had supported the nuclear tests which ultimately led Prime Minister Narasimha Rao deciding to conduct further tests in 1995. Plans were halted after American spy satellites picked up signs of preparations for nuclear testing at Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. President Bill Clinton and his administration exerted enormous pressure on Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to stop the preparations. Responding to India, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto issued harsh criticism of India on Pakistan's news channels; thus putting stress on the relations between two countries. Diplomatic tensions escalated between India and Pakistan when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised the Kashmir issue at the United Nations in 1995. In a speech delivered by then-Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gillani, stressed the \\"Kashmir problem\\" as a continuing threat to peace and security in the region. The Indian delegation headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the United Nations, reiterated that the \\"UN resolutions only call upon Pakistan‚Äî the occupying force to vacate the \\"Jammu and Kashmir Area.\\" = 1998 Indian general elections = The BJP, came to power in 1998 general elections with an exclusive public mandate. BJP's political might had been growing steadily in strength over the past decade over several issues. In Pakistan, the similar conservative force, the PML(N), was also in power with an exclusive mandate led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who defeated the leftist PPP led by Benazir Bhutto in the general elections held in 1997.See: 1997 Pakistani general elections During the BJP campaign, Atal Bihari Vajpayee indulged in grandstanding‚Äî such as when he declared on 25 February that his government would \\"take back that part of Kashmir that is under Pakistan's control.\\" Before this declaration, the BJP platform had clear intentions to \\"exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons\\" and \\"India should become an openly nuclear power to garner the respect on the world stage that India deserved.\\" By 18 March 1998, Vajpayee publicly began lobbying for nuclear testing and declared that \\"there is no compromise on national security; all options including the nuclear options will be exercised to protect security and sovereignty.\\" Consultation began between Prime Minister Vajpayee, Dr.Abdul Kalam, R. Chidambaram and officials of the Indian DAE on nuclear options. Chidambaram briefed Prime Minister Vajpayee extensively on the nuclear program; Abdul Kalam presented the status of the missile program. On 28 March 1998, Prime Minister Vajpayee asked the scientists to make preparations in the shortest time possible, and preparations were hastily made. Pakistan, at a Conference on Disarmament, offered a peace agreement with India for \\"an equal and mutual restraint in conventional, missile and nuclear fields.\\" Pakistan's equation was later reemphasised on 6 April and the momentum in India for nuclear tests began to build up which strengthened Vajpayee's position to order the tests. = Preparations for the test = US Marine Intelligence maps showing the Indian test site, 1997. Unlike Pakistan's weapon‚Äìtesting laboratories, there was very little that India could do to hide its activity at Pokhran. Unlike the high-altitude granite mountains in Pakistan, the bushes are sparse and the dunes in the Rajasthan Desert don't provide much cover from probing satellites. The Indian Intelligence Agency had been aware of United States spy satellites and the CIA had been detecting Indian test preparations since 1995. Therefore, the tests required complete secrecy in India and also needed to avoid detection by other countries. The 58th Engineer Regiment of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers was commissioned to prepare the test sites to avoid detection by the United States spy satellites. The 58th Engineer's commander Colonel Gopal Kaushik supervised the test preparations and ordered his \\"staff officers take all measures to ensure total secrecy.\\" Extensive planning was done by a small group of scientists, senior military officers and senior politicians to ensure that the test preparations would remain secret, and even senior members of the Indian government didn't know what was going on. The chief scientific adviser and the Director of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Dr. Abdul Kalam, and Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Director of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), were the chief coordinators of this test planning. The scientists and engineers of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMDER), and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were involved in the nuclear weapon assembly, layout, detonation and data collection. A small group of senior scientists were involved in the detonation process. All scientists were required to wear army uniforms to preserve the secrecy of the tests. Since 1995, the 58th Engineer Regiment had learned how to avoid satellite detection. Work was mostly done during night, and equipment was returned to the original place to give the impression that it was never moved. Bomb shafts were dug under camouflage netting and the dug-out sand was shaped like dunes. Cables for sensors were covered with sand and concealed using native vegetation. Scientists would not depart for Pokhran in groups of two or three. They travelled to destinations other than Pokhran under pseudonyms, and were then transported by the army. Technical staff at the test range wore military uniforms, to prevent detection in satellite images.  Nuclear weapon designs and development  = Development and test teams = The main technical personnel involved in the operation were: * Project Chief Coordinators : ** Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (later, President of India), Scientific Adviser to the prime minister and Head of the DRDO. ** Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Atomic energy. *Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) : **Dr. K. Santhanam; Director, Test Site Preparations. *Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research : **Dr. G. R. Dikshitulu; Senior Research Scientist B.S.O.I Group, Nuclear Materials Acquisition. *Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) : **Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Director of BARC. **Dr. Satinder Kumar Sikka, Director; Thermonuclear Weapon Development. **Dr. M. S. Ramakumar, Director of Nuclear Fuel and Automation Manufacturing Group; Director, Nuclear Component Manufacture. **Dr. D.D. Sood, Director of Radiochemistry and Isotope Group; Director, Nuclear Materials Acquisition. **Dr. S.K. Gupta, Solid State Physics and Spectroscopy Group; Director, Device Design & Assessment. **Dr. G. Govindraj, Associate Director of Electronic and Instrumentation Group; Director, Field Instrumentation. = Movement and logistics = The Thar Desert in the state of Rajasthan where the nuclear site, the Pokhran Test Range, is located. Three laboratories of the DRDO were involved in designing, testing and producing components for the bombs, including the advanced detonators, the implosion and high-voltage trigger systems. These were also responsible for weaponising, systems engineering, aerodynamics, safety interlocks and flight trials. The bombs were transported in four Indian Army trucks under the command of Colonel Umang Kapur; all devices from BARC were relocated at 3 am on 1 May 1998. From the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, the bombs were flown in an Indian Air Force's AN-32 commanded by Squadron Leader Mahendra Prasad Sharma plane to Jaisalmer. They were transported to Pokhran in an army convoy of four trucks, and this required three trips. The devices were delivered to the device preparation building, which was designated as 'Prayer Hall'. The test sites was organised into two government groups and were fired separately, with all devices in a group fired at the same time. The first group consisted of the thermonuclear device (Shakti I), the fission device (Shakti II), and a sub- kiloton device (Shakti III). The second group consisted of the remaining two sub-kiloton devices Shakti IV and V. It was decided that the first group would be tested on 11 May and the second group on 13 May. The thermonuclear device was placed in a shaft code named 'White House', which was over deep, the fission bomb was placed in a deep shaft code named 'Taj Mahal', and the first sub-kiloton device in 'Kumbhkaran'. The first three devices were placed in their respective shafts on 10 May, and the first device to be placed was the sub-kiloton device in the 'Kumbhkaran' shaft, which was sealed by the army engineers by 8:30 pm. The thermonuclear device was lowered and sealed into the 'White House' shaft by 4 am, and the fission device being placed in the 'Taj Mahal' shaft was sealed at 7:30 am, which was 90 minutes before the planned test time. The shafts were L-shaped, with a horizontal chamber for the test device. The timing of the tests depended on the local weather conditions, with the wind being the critical factor. The tests were underground, but due to a number of shaft seal failures that had occurred during tests conducted by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the sealing of the shaft could not be guaranteed to be leak-proof. By early afternoon, the winds had died down and the test sequence was initiated. Dr. K. Santhanam of the DRDO, in charge of the test site preparations, gave the two keys that activated the test countdown to Dr. M. Vasudev, the range safety officer, who was responsible for verifying that all test indicators were normal. After checking the indicators, Vasudev handed one key each to a representative of BARC and the DRDO, who unlocked the countdown system together. At 3:45 pm the three devices were detonated. = Specifications and detonation = Five nuclear devices were made during Operation Shakti. Four of the devices were weapon-grade plutonium and one Thorium/U-233. They were: * Shakti I ‚Äì A thermonuclear device yielding 56 kt, but designed for up to 200 kt. The yield of this device was deliberately kept low in order to avoid civilian damage and to eliminate the possibility of a radioactive leak. * Shakti II ‚Äì A plutonium implosion design yielding 15 kt and intended as a warhead that could be delivered by bomber or missile. It was an improvement of the device detonated in the 1974 Smiling Buddha (Pokhran-I) test of 1974, developed using simulations on the PARAM supercomputer. * Shakti III ‚Äì An experimental linear implosion design that used \\"non-weapon grade\\"Note: While the plutonium used in Shakti III has been reported in some sources as \\"reactor-grade\\", it may have been fuel-grade, which is intermediate between the former and weapons-grade; cf. Why You Can‚Äôt Build a Bomb From Spent Fuel plutonium, but which likely omitted the material required for fusion, yielding 0.3 kt. * Shakti IV- A 0.5 kt experimental device. * Shakti V ‚Äì A 0.2 kt Thorium/U-233 experimental device. An additional, sixth device (Shakti VI) is suspected to have been present but not detonated. At 3:43 pm IST; three nuclear bombs (specifically, the Shakti I, II and III) were detonated simultaneously, as measured by international seismic monitors. On 13 May, at 12.21 p.m.IST 6:51 UTC, two sub- kiloton devices (Shakti IV and V) were detonated. Due to their very low yield, these explosions were not detected by any seismic station. On 13 May 1998, India declared the series of tests to be over after this. = Announcement = Following the Pokhran-II tests, India became the sixth country to join the nuclear club. Shortly after the tests, a press meet was convened at the Prime Minister's residence in New Delhi. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appeared before the press corps and made the following short statement:  Reactions to tests  = Domestic reactions = News of the tests were greeted with jubilation and large-scale approval by society in India. The Bombay Stock Exchange registered significant gains. Newspapers and television channels praised the government for its bold decision; editorials were full of praise for the country's leadership and advocated the development of an operational nuclear arsenal for the country's armed forces. The Indian opposition, led by Congress Party criticised the Vajpayee administration for carrying out the series of nuclear tests. The Congress Party spokesperson Salman Khursheed, accused the BJP of trying to use the tests for political ends rather than to enhance the country's national security. By the time India had conducted tests, the country had a total of $44bn in loans in 1998, from the IMF and the World Bank. The industrial sectors of the Indian economy, such as the chemicals industry, were likely to be hurt by sanctions. The Western consortium companies, which had invested heavily in India, especially in construction, computing and telecoms, were generally the ones who were harmed by the sanctions. In 1998, Indian government announced that it had already allowed for some economic response and was willing to take the consequences.  International reactions  = Canada, Japan, and other countries = Strong criticism was drawn from Canada on India's actions and its High Commissioner. Sanctions were also imposed by Japan on India and consisted of freezing all new loans and grants except for humanitarian aid to India. Some other nations also imposed sanctions on India, primarily in the form of suspension of foreign aid to India and government-to-government credit lines. However, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia refrained from condemning India. = China = On 12 May the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated: \\"The Chinese government is seriously concerned about the nuclear tests conducted by India,\\" and that the tests \\"run counter to the current international trend and are not conducive to peace and stability in South Asia.\\". The next day the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued the statement clearly stating that \\"it is shocked and strongly condemned\\" the Indian nuclear tests and called for the international community to \\"adopt a unified stand and strongly demand that India immediate stop development of nuclear weapons\\". China further rejected India's stated rationale of needing nuclear capabilities to counter a Chinese threat as \\"totally unreasonable\\". In a meeting with Masayoshi Takemura of Democratic Party of Japan, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Qian Qichen was quoted as saying that India's nuclear tests were a \\"serious matter,\\" particularly because they were conducted in light of the fact that more than 140 countries have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \\"It is even more unacceptable that India claims to have conducted the tests to counter what it called a \\"China threat\\". On 24 November 1998, the Chinese Embassy, New Delhi issued a formal statement: = Pakistan = The most vehement and strong reaction to India's nuclear explosion was from a neighbouring country, Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan, which issued a severe statement blaming India for instigating a nuclear arms race in the region. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that his country would give a suitable reply to India. The day after the first tests, Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan indicated that Pakistan was ready to conduct a nuclear test. He stated: \\"Pakistan is prepared to match India, we have the capability.... We in Pakistan will maintain a balance with India in all fields\\", he said in an interview. \\"We are in a headlong arms race on the subcontinent.\\" On 13 May 1998, Pakistan bitterly condemned the tests, and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub was quoted as saying that Indian leadership seemed to \\"have gone berserk [sic] and was acting in a totally unrestrained way.\\" Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was much more subdued, maintaining ambiguity about whether a test would be conducted in response: \\"We are watching the situation and we will take appropriate action with regard to our security\\", he said. Sharif sought to mobilise the entire Islamic world in support of Pakistan and criticised India for nuclear proliferation. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had been under intense pressure regarding the nuclear tests by President Bill Clinton and Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto at home. Initially surprising the world, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif authorised a nuclear testing program and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) carried out nuclear testing under the codename Chagai-I on 28 May 1998 and Chagai-II on 30 May 1998. These six underground nuclear tests at the Chagai and Kharan test site were conducted fifteen days after India's last test. The total yield of the tests was reported to be 40 kt (see codename: Chagai-I).See Chagai-I Pakistan's subsequent tests invited similar condemnation from the United States. American President Bill Clinton was quoted as saying \\"Two wrongs don't make a right\\", criticising Pakistan's tests as reactionary to India's Pokhran-II. The United States and Japan reacted by imposing economic sanctions on Pakistan. According to the Pakistan's science community, the Indian nuclear tests gave an opportunity to Pakistan to conduct nuclear tests after 14 years of conducting only cold tests (See: Kirana-I). Pakistan's leading nuclear physicist, Pervez Hoodbhoy, held India responsible for Pakistan's nuclear test experiments in Chagai. = United States = The United States issued a strong statement condemning India and promised that sanctions would follow. The American intelligence community was embarrassed as there had been \\"a serious intelligence failure of the decade\\" in detecting the preparations for the test. In keeping with its preferred approach to foreign policy in recent decades, and in compliance with the 1994 anti-proliferation law, the United States imposed economic sanctions on India. The sanctions on India consisted of cutting off all assistance to India except humanitarian aid, banning the export of certain defence material and technologies, ending American credit and credit guarantees to India, and requiring the US to oppose lending by international financial institutions to India. From 1998‚Äì1999, the United States held series of bilateral talks with India over the issue of India becoming party of the CTBT and NPT. In addition, the United States also made an unsuccessful attempt of holding talks regarding the rollback of India's nuclear program. India took a firm stand against the CTBT and refusing to be signatory party of it despite under pressure by the US President Bill Clinton, and noted the treaty as it was not consistent with India's national security interest. = U.N. scrutinization = The reactions from abroad started immediately after the tests were advertised. On 6 June, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1172 condemning the test and that of Pakistan's. China issued a vociferous condemnation calling upon the international community to exert pressure on India to sign the NPT and eliminate its nuclear arsenal. With India joining the group of countries possessing nuclear weapons, a new strategic dimension had emerged in Asia, particularly South Asia.  Legacy  The Indian government has officially declared 11 May as National Technology Day in India to commemorate the first of the five nuclear tests that were carried out on 11 May 1998. It was officially signed by then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998 and the day is celebrated by giving awards to various individuals and industries in the field of science and technology.

Phantom Manor is the park's version of the Haunted Mansion attractions at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, although a lot of scenes from the Haunted Mansion have been reimagined to coincide with a darker theme. It opened with Euro Disneyland on April 12, 1992. The attraction combines a walk-through portion with Omnimover vehicles and features special effects and Audio-Animatronics. This version of the popular Haunted Mansion rides has a different plot line. It is also designed to be scarier and darker than the other Haunted Mansion rides. The ride also features a unique soundtrack, differing from the American and Japanese versions.  History  While planning Euro Disneyland, Tony Baxter, executive designer for Walt Disney Imagineering, decided that certain staple Disney attractions would have to be modified for the new park. The Haunted Mansion was among these and was given a darker tone than the original attraction. Jeff Burke was assigned the role of executive producer for the construction of this park's version of Frontierland and, with help from Imagineer Bob Baranick and show writer Craig Fleming, it was decided that the story related to Phantom Manor would have to be congruent with that of Thunder Mesa, the fictional town portrayed in Frontierland. A similar treatment was given to the Paris version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. A major influence for the story of the ride was Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera, the secondary plot focusing on the abandoned bride Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, as well as many European gothic legends, which were altered for a Western setting. The architectural style is Victorian Second Empire. Imagineer Marc Davis disliked the derelict aspect of the building, stating \\"Walt would never approve of it.\\" Like the other Haunted Mansion rides, only the first scene takes place in the mansion structure itself, the remainder of the ride takes place in a building hidden from park guests. The architecture is in the Second Empire style. Inspiration for Paris's Frontierland architecture was provided by historic buildings in Virginia City, Nevada, specifically the Fourth Ward School for Phantom Manor. Story = The Story = The story of Phantom Manor was inspired by the never-built Western River Expedition, which was a Pirates of the Caribbean-style attraction designed by Marc Davis for Walt Disney World's Frontierland. Henry Ravenswood (born 1795) was a Western settler who struck gold in Big Thunder Mountain and founded the Big Thunder Mining Company, thus creating the city of Thunder Mesa (Frontierland as a whole). Ravenswood became rich and built himself a Victorian manor high on Boot Hill overlooking Big Thunder Mountain, where he lived with his wife Martha (born 1802) and his daughter, Melanie Ravenswood (born 1842). Big Thunder Mountain was rumored by natives to be home to the Thunder Bird, a powerful spirit possessing a treasure. According to the legend, its wrath could be materialized into a terrible earthquake. However, Ravenswood would not believe such stories. Years went by and the gold in Big Thunder Mountain became scarce, making miners dig deeper into the mountain. Melanie grew from a young girl into a beautiful young woman and became drawn to several suitors who planned to take her far away from Thunder Mesa, much to the dismay of Henry. Henry did everything he could to stop this, with the first four being subjected to various cruel fates. Sawyer Bottom was sawed in half by a saw blade, Captain Rowan D. Falls fell off of a waterfall, Ignatius \\"Iggy\\" Knight was blown up by dynamite and Barry Claude was mauled to death by a bear. With Bottom, Falls, Knight and Claude all dead, Henry's attempts became useless in order to stop Melanie in the midst of being engaged to a train engineer named Jake when a terrible earthquake killed him and Martha in 1860. It seemed the Thunder Bird had been awakened and the family was never heard of again. After several years, the story of what really happened came out from underneath the rubble: On Melanie's wedding day, a mysterious Phantom unknown to anyone appeared in the house. Unbeknownst to anyone, this was the spirit of Henry himself, seeking vengeance on Jake for his defiance of him. While Melanie was preparing in her room, Henry lured Jake up to the attic where he hanged him by the neck from the rafters. In the ballroom, the bride sat alone. Hours went by with no sign of the groom. Guests slowly filed away, leaving Melanie alone in the house with the staff of maids and butlers. \\"Some day\\", she told herself, \\"he will come\\". And so, having never taken off her wedding dress or dropped her flower bouquet, in preparation for her loved one's return, she wandered the house aimlessly, singing melancholy songs of lost love. But Henry was still in the house, laughing at his daughter's devotion to her intended husband. One after one, Henry invited his dead, demonic friends from the afterlife to fill the house in an eternal party. A dark curse fell upon the house and the shape of the house was slowly transformed by the evil forces. No one ever set foot in the house ever since. Inside and outside, the house was decaying with age. Dusty cobwebs covered every inch, the disheartened staff not caring, for it was rumored that Melanie had lost her mind. She wandered the house for years and years, singing softly to her groom, while all around her demons and ghosts reveled and danced. Everywhere she went she was reminded of the wedding. Her father's eternal laughter still carried through the walls of the house. Outside, the once beautiful grounds were falling apart and crumbling. The gilded staircase and structure were dotted with mold and trees and every plant on the grounds died. As if sensing the evil inherent in the house, nothing living ever trod there. Even so, Melanie kept her hopes, waiting for her love's return and never figured why he didn't show up at the wedding. The earthquake that killed her parents all those years ago cut a huge gouge in the west half of the property and in the crumbling ghost town of the old Thunder Mesa. The deserted buildings were rumored to be called Phantom Canyon, the dark supernatural version of the town and anyone who entered the ghastly old town at night never came back. Today, no one knows if Melanie Ravenswood is still alive in that old house on the hill. If she is, then she is well over 100 years old. Her beautiful voice still carries over the town at night though, through the walls of the house and night air. And sometimes, people still see lights in the house. Some nights, when the moon is full and the sky is clear of clouds, one can still hear the lonely mourning of the bride, the maniacal laughter of Henry, and the faint tinkle of glass and the laughter of party guests. Whether she is alive or not, what is well known is that poor Melanie never really left the crumbling mansion. She waits for a groom until Judgment Day. And if you set foot in the house, her eye might be on you... Attraction Like the Haunted Mansions located in other Disney parks, only the introduction of the ride (the Octagonal Portrait Gallery) takes place in the visible Manor. The actual ride itself takes place in a large warehouse-style show building hidden behind the Manor. Phantom Manor's Omnimover portion is similar to the Disneyland Haunted Mansion's system. The track layouts of both are almost identical, but not completely. The main difference is that Phantom Manor's track is slightly longer, primarily to accommodate the Phantom Canyon scenes that substitute for the graveyard scenes in the other rides. Many scenes from the classic Haunted Mansions are replicated, but altered to incorporate the new Western theme and plot, such as the Octagonal Portrait Gallery, the Portrait Corridor, the Endless Hallway, the Conservatory, the Corridor of Doors, Madame Leota‚Äôs Seance Room, the Ballroom, and even the busts singing Grim Grinning Ghosts. =Outside queue= In the original Haunted Mansions at Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, the mansion was designed to look clean and aesthetically pleasing. Phantom Manor, however, is designed to look clearly derelict and stands at the top of a small hill, looking out onto the southern side of Big Thunder Mountain, with a commanding view of the washed out trestle, the mine elevator, and the second lift hill. The Manor's grounds are untended, overgrown with weeds and scattered with dead vegetation. Upon entering the grounds, guests can see a bat guard box and a plaque on the wall which reads Phantom Manor ‚Äì Non Omnis Moriar (Latin for \\"I shall not die completely\\"). A derelict gazebo stands on the lawn that has a tea set laid out. Originally, these used to move to mimic two people pouring and drinking tea, at night, the light in the gazebo flickers. The gazebo also contains a music box playing within (since 2001, this music box track is also used in Disneyland's version for use on the annual seasonal overlay). This is also the only mansion in any of the parks that has guests enter the ride through the front door. Shadows and lights can be seen from within the house at nighttime. Melanie can also be seen from a window in the fa√ßade carrying a candle from one window to the next. =The Foyer= Guests walk up the pathways towards the Manor, along the porch and queue outside the house where they wait for admission. A cast member dressed as a macabre servant opens the doors and invites a small group of them into the foyer. Original version (1992‚Äì2018) This foyer contains a dusty chandelier and two mirrors, and is lined with dark wood panelling. The voice of the Phantom sounds from the ceiling and around the room, politely welcoming guests, telling them the Legend of this place and inviting them to explore the Manor further. Melanie's face fades in and out of the smallest mirror during the narration. New version (2019‚Äìpresent) In the 2019 refurbishment an additional effect was added to the foyer. The small mirror was replaced by a painting of Melanie in her wedding gown, looking sad, and Jake, standing behind her outside the decrepit house also sad. A tree with no leaves is also behind them with 4 hearts crossed out and a noose hanging from one of its branches revealing Jake's fate. When the voice of the Ghost Host starts telling guests the legend of the Manor, the painting changes. It now shows a happier Melanie, dressed in summer clothes, while Jake is now smiling and resting one hand on Melanie. The Manor is in pristine condition, and the tree, now with leaves, has one heart and a swing hanging from its branches. Lighting effects also transform the wallpaper in the room from old and torn to brand- new. The Phantom was originally voiced by Vincent Price, but legal agreements that required the narration to be primarily in French meant that a French writer, G√©rard Chevalier, was brought in to record a French version of Price's narration, which was only used for the first few months of the attraction's operation. Chevalier used to be a dub for Price in many of his movies. However, a small piece of Price's recording was kept in use: the Phantom's maniacal laughter. In 2018, it was announced that during Phantom Manor's major renovation, parts of Price's narration would be restored to the soundtrack of the attraction. For the 2019 re-opening, the new tracks feature Price once again, original excerpts as well as previously unused material from his 1990 recording, spoken English, with French actor Bernard Alane doing the parts in French. The Phantom says (French lines in italics, translated into English below): 'When hinges creak in doorless chambers, when strange and frighting sounds are heard all around, when candlelight flickers though the air is deathly still, that is the time when the Phantom manifests. Welcome curious friends, it is so nice to have guests. We welcome you, humble mortals, to this mysterious manor. You may not believe it but beauty once lived in this house. Phantom Manor had happier days, but times have changed. And now curious souls, come, I have more to show you. Enter brave mortals into this famous manor together.' =Octagonal Portrait Gallery= Guests then enter an octagonal room with four portraits of a young Melanie, with each of her four suitors. The Phantom comments on the gallery, referring to the 'sweet innocence of youth'. Shortly after, Melanie fades away from each of the paintings, with only the suitors left and the Phantom acknowledges a 'disquieting metamorphosis' and that 'not all tales have happy endings'. Suddenly the room appears to stretch upwards and the paintings grow taller, revealing what happened to each of Melanie's suitors: *Barry Claude sitting on a tree branch missing one of his shoes, while an angry bear and her cub roar at him from below *Sawyer Bottom straddling a log and being sawed in half by an industrial buzzsaw *Captain Rowan D. Falls riding in a rowboat about to head over a waterfall *Ignatius \\"Iggy\\" Knight, standing atop several crates of TNT and an ignited barrel of dynamite. The Phantom comments \\"It appears everyone is doomed at Phantom Manor. Even you.\\" He goes on to add that the chamber has no windows and no doors, offering the guests a \\"chilling challenge\\": to find a way out. After his maniacal laughter echoes away, he adds that \\"the Phantom\\" (referring to himself) would be happy to help them ‚Äî lightning and thunder effects fill the space as the ceiling turns invisible and the Phantom reveals himself in the attic, holding a noose and sinisterly laughing. Then suddenly, lights go out completely and the guests are shrouded in darkness. The gallery's lights slowly come back on and a hidden door opens, revealing a hallway lined with portraits. The Phantom apologizes for frightening the guests prematurely and beckons them further into the Manor, and states that \\"the real beauty of this house awaits us, farther on, and she's dying to meet you, but beware of the Phantom\\" (once again referencing himself). From 1992 to 2018, the four portraits were of a young Melanie, pictured in more felicitous times, only to stretch to reveal more macabre situations: *Melanie is having a picnic with Jake Evans as ants, a rattlesnake, scorpion, spider and beetle raid their food *Melanie holds a parasol as she rides in a boat about to go over a waterfall *Melanie picks roses from above a tombstone while a skeletal zombie emerges from the ground, gripping a small rake in one hand *Melanie wades through a small stream as an aquatic monster reaches for her foot. The scene revealed in the attic was also slightly different until 2018; instead of just showing the Phantom evilly laughing, he was hanging Jake Evans, Melanie's sole groom in the original version of the attraction. Like in the Disneyland version of the ride, the Octagonal Portrait Gallery is actually a pair of cleverly disguised OTIS elevators. The floor is lowered and the ceiling is raised slowly at the same time to provide the stretching illusion. This serves the double purpose of both dramatic effect, while lowering guests from the Manor to where the actual ride begins at real ground level in a separate warehouse-style show building behind the berm, hidden by a forest of trees to render it invisible from riders on Big Thunder Mountain and the rest of the park. The ceiling above is actually a scrim, which conceals the Phantom until he is backlit from above. =Inside queue= Stepping out of the Stretching Room, guests walk down the Portrait Corridor, which takes them from the Manor visible from within the park into the show building that houses the actual ride, unlike the Disneyland version, this corridor does not pass under the park's railroad (which instead travels behind the show building and has the Grand Canyon Diorama in this area to obscure the show building). As the guests walk down the corridor, they see four portraits, slowly morphing into more macabre images. The original paintings were all of which were taken from California (and have since been added to Walt Disney World) version of the ride: * A knight and his horse on a cliff both becoming ghostly beings. * A young woman in a Greek temple sprouts snakes from her hair and becomes Medusa. * A ship sailing across the sea becomes a tattered and ghostly version of itself sailing through a storm. * A woman reclining on a sofa turns into a were-panther. While the portrait of the sailing ship, though changed slightly, was retained in the 2019 refurbishment, the other three were all replaced with: * Henry Ravenswood becoming the Phantom (replacing Medusa). * Henry and another man (possibly an unnamed suitor) outside the Manor about to have a duel, with it changing to Henry shooting his opponent in the back (replacing the were-panther). This one is a reference to the duelist-painting ghosts in the Ballroom of the Disneyland ride. * A cowboy and his horse on a cliff gazing off at Big Thunder Mountain becoming spectral beings while a ghostly cattle emerges from the sky (replacing the knight). At the end of the hallway stands a large portrait of Melanie Ravenswood, wearing her bridal gown, from which she can be heard singing. Guests then turn a corner and enter the loading area, a large hall with the Grand Staircase leading to the upper floor. One can see a ghostly, foggy landscape with flashes and bolts of lightning through the huge window above the stairs, and Melanie standing on the midway landing. Old furniture line the walls, and sitting on a shelf is a bust of a stern-looking woman, who stares at guests and seems to follow them as they pass by. An unbroken train of black Omnimover vehicles known as \\"carriages\\" move through the center of the room, alongside a moving platform to enable easy loading. =The ride= Guests board the carriages, each accommodating two to three persons and then move upwards to the show building's main floor. Prior to 2019, guests would pass a young Melanie bowing while holding a candelabra and singing the entire time. After the renovations, Melanie is moved to the loading area and now a twitching suit of armor is in her place (a reference to when Disneyland's Haunted Mansion had a live actor in a knight costume in 1969). After passing the armor is a seemingly Endless Hallway, with the vision of Melanie and the Phantom appearing and disappearing in the distance while the candelabra that she is holding remains in view. On the left side of the Corridor is a Conservatory containing a piano, adorned with the wreaths of the deceased suitors. At first glance, it seems to be playing a minor chord version of \\"The Wedding March\\" by itself, but one can notice a ghost pianist's shadow falling on the carpet (this effect is achieved by the use of mechanical keys). A large, red-eyed raven sits on a music stand next to the piano and squawks madly. The carriages then travel through a corridor lined with doors. As guests pass each door, they hear pounding, knocking, or shouting behind it, and the knockers seem to move by themselves, as if their inhabitants are struggling to get out. When the last door is reached, guests can see two skeletal hands clutching at the top, trying to force their way through, with the skeleton yelling \\"Let me out of here!\\" (It uses the same audio as the skeleton attempting to escape his coffin in the Conservatory in the other Haunted Mansions). The carriages pass a small hall containing a demonic grandfather clock, with a large \\"13\\" on its face (instead of the usual 12) and its hands spinning backward as it chimes. The walls are lined with wallpaper covered in demon eyes, of which start to glow green. The carriages then enter a round Seance Room filled with gargoyles, where a crystal ball sits on a floating central table and at one time, ghostly shapes appeared in the windows surrounding the room. In it is the witch, Madame Leota's disembodied head. Behind her is a raven perched on a chair. As guests watch her, she summons ghosts and dark creatures to a mysterious ball in both English and French (translated in English below): 'Goblins and Ghoulies, creatures of fright, we summon you now, to dance through the night! Spirits and ghosts, on your proud stallions, accompany the beautiful bride through the night! Warlocks and Witches, answer this call! Your presence is wanted at this ghostly ball! From the twelve knolls of midnight to the morning bells, we shall waltz together, gruesome debutante! Join now the Spirits in Nuptial Doom, a ravishing Bride, a vanishing Groom...' Guests leave the Seance Room and move along a balcony, looking down into the Ballroom, where a ghostly wedding party takes place. Melanie stands on a staircase, singing while the Phantom stands behind her, laughing at her as lightning flashes behind him. Ghostly guests enter the room, bringing in wedding presents, then sitting around the dining table, where a moldy wedding cake is waiting for them. Drunken ghosts swing precariously from the chandelier above the table. Elegantly dressed pairs of ghostly dancers twirl around the Ballroom, as a spirit organist sits at a massive organ, playing a haunting waltz on it as wraiths fly out of its pipes. Apart from plot-related retheming, this scene is similar to the regular Haunted Mansions' ballrooms. During soft-opening previews after the 2019 refurbishment, the music here was temporarily replaced with the equivalent music from the regular Haunted Mansions, but was switched back after backlash. Leaving the Ballroom, the vehicles enter the Bride's Boudoir (which replaces the attic scene in the regular rides). A dying fire is crackling in the fireplace. Guests then see Melanie who has given up looking for her long lost groom. Melanie sits weeping into a mirror as an old woman while her father's skeletal face stares back at her. All the while, a music box plays, as well as an old gramophone. Prior to 2019, Melanie in this scene was still an old lady, but the mirror was fogged up to look like an actual skull, in reference to the Allan Gilbert painting, All is Vanity.https://mbracedefreak.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/vanity-and-the-gossip/ The clock displayed in the room has a blade pendulum, in reference to Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" which was also the basis for a movie featuring Vincent Price. The carriages leave the Bride's Boudoir through open double doors and glide across a terrace and then into a stormy graveyard, past the Phantom with a shovel (whose skeletal face is revealed) standing before an open grave, with an undead dog growling beside him. The Phantom laughs as the Doombuggies pass by. This is Phantom Manor's version of the friendly but frightened groundskeeper and his dog in the other Haunted Mansions. The carriages then travel underground to the catacombs (presumably Boot Hill) and see a series of coffins being opened by their skeletal residents as well as the skeleton hands attempting to pry open a coffin from the inside, usually in the conservatory scene in the Haunted Mansion. The Singing Busts then come into view, singing Grim Grinning Ghosts as the dead skeletons join them in a dance. Through a hole, the carriages then enter Phantom Canyon, which is a twisted, supernatural version of Thunder Mesa. Great rifts in the earth surrounding the vehicles suggest that an earthquake has happened, which reenacts Thunder Mesa's turning point from a prosperous community to a ghost town. An eerie-looking ticket master (an animatronic using the same mold as Ezra, one of the original Hitchhiking Ghosts from the American rides) stands before a ramshackle train station, offering the riders train tickets to the Underworld. Guests then pass a ruined town hall where the mayor (who speaks clips of dialogue from Paul Frees, the original rides' Ghost Host, and who is modeled from the same mold as animatronics of Dreamfinder from the original version of Epcot's Journey into Imagination with Figment) holds the Key to the City and invites guests to be the Manor's 1000th ghost, \\"but beware of hitchhiking ghosts!\\" As he tips his hat, his head comes with it. A shootout follows between a bank robber fleeing on a mule and a cowardly sheriff, with Big Thunder Mountain in the background behind the sheriff. Guests see a pharmacy where a green-faced pharmacist drinks a potion of some-sort, followed by a saloon whose front wall has caved in. Inside it, there is a dancing showgirl, a bartender and a man playing a honky-tonk piano. Every once in a while, a hand with a candelabra appears out of the piano. Four invisible gambler figures play poker nearby. Much of Phantom Canyon was derived from a planned scene of a wild mining town called Dry Gulch in the Western River Expedition at the Magic Kingdom, later retooled into their version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Phantom Canyon occupies a space that in the regular Haunted Mansions is used for the graveyard scene. Another cackling figure of the Phantom and his raven stands by a tree with a noose and several empty coffins for awaiting guests, his eyes glowing red at passing riders. Prior to 2019, this animatronic version of the Phantom was a skeleton with rotting flesh on his body, showing the guests that he has lost any humanity he's ever had left in him. As they see the silhouette of the Manor ahead, they enter the mausoleum, where Melanie's four suitors were buried. Prior to 2019, guests would encounter Melanie's floating skeleton pointing the way out. The vehicles enter a subterranean chamber lined with large, gilt-framed mirrors in which the ghostly image of Melanie, driven insane by the loss of her suitors and groom, appears in the vehicles, beckoning riders to wed her. Vehicles travel through a wine cellar, where cast members await to help them disembark their carriages and they walk toward the exit. =Post show= As guests travel towards day light, the evil laughter of the Phantom can be heard, as well as Melanie's voice, telling guests to \\"hurry back\\" and to \\"bring their death certificates\\". Prior to 2019, a small Melanie would beckon guests to hurry back. Finally, guests exit into Boot Hill, a Cemetery filled with humorous gravestones, as well as ride-oriented gravestones for the Ravenswoods and several others. If one should turn around to look back at the house, they can see the Phantom looking out the window over the exit and down at them, before he closes the curtains. It is easier to see him at night, since there is a light shining behind him. In the Cemetery, one can hear Melanie's beating heart in her tomb, both a reference to the original Haunted Mansion bride, whose red beating heart could be seen through her chest and Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart. Soundtrack * An opening narration by Vincent Price was recorded and initially used. However, due to a deal with French officials, the attraction's audio had to be primarily in French; thus the narration was rerecorded by G√©rard Chevalier, who had provided a dubbed French voice for Price in some of his movies. Price's narration is available on the CD The Haunted Mansion - 30th Anniversary (1999 CD). Parts of Price's original narration in English were restored to the soundtrack in 2019, including excerpts previously unused in the attraction. * The attraction features an orchestrated score by John Debney. Although it is based on Buddy Baker's Grim Grinning Ghosts, it provides the attraction with a cinematic feeling, along with giving it a darker, more romantic tone. In the climactic Phantom Canyon scene, a big-band-style swing version of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" is heard, compared to the original version's \\"spirited\\" but straight meter. Other information * In the early 2000s, Phantom Manor was given a special Halloween celebration. Known as The Phantom Wedding, it featured a large scrim covering the whole building, which was used for projection of Melanie's recreated wedding. In 2005, however, this celebration was replaced by another. *On January 8, 2018, Phantom Manor closed for refurbishment. The graveyard has remained relatively untouched, though the walkway and manor itself were covered in scaffolding. At the FanDaze event at Walt Disney Studios Park on June 2, Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald confirmed that Vincent Price's original English dialogue would return to Phantom Manor following its refurbishment. The ride soft-reopened on April 30, 2019 and fully reopened on May 3.  Incidents  * During the morning of April 2, 2016, the body of a 45-year-old cast member was found inside the attraction. He had been working on lighting backstage and his death was understood to have been accidental and due to electrocution. The ride was closed pending an investigation.

It grew rapidly and by the 1880s had more than 300 pupils although, as with many similar schools, it declined over the next 30 years and in 1910 numbers dropped to 150. Two powerful headmasters - Herbert Rhodes and David Loveday restored Cranleigh's fortunes. Cranleigh started to admit girls in the early 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1999. The current headmaster is Martin Reader with former East Housemaster, Simon Bird, as the Deputy Head. The school's Trevor Abbott Sports Centre was opened by Sir Richard Branson and the West House was opened by Baroness Greenfield. New building projects include the recently completed extension onto Cubitt House as well as an environmentally friendly Woodland Workshop and a new ¬£10 million Academic Centre named the Emms Centre. Named after David Emms, this was opened by Lord Patten of Barnes in 2009. The building includes new facilities for Science and Modern Languages as well as a lecture theatre. A ¬£2 million renovation of the chapel in 2009 included the installation of a ¬£500,000 Mander organ. The school is especially recognised for its quality of output in both the arts and sport. In a 2015 survey, it was rated as the third best sporting school in the UK, with further success coming in the form of being one of the only schools to win the Rosslyn Park National Sevens Tournament consecutively, in both 2016 and 2017.

Travelers should be well-aware of where this parasite might be a problem and how to prevent the infection. S. japonicum occurs in the Far East, such as China, the Philippines, Indonesia and Southeast Asia.https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/epi.html Discovery S. japonicum was discovered in Kofu basin by Dr. Fujiro Katsurada, a pathologist in Okayama University in 1904. Later, Katsurada named the parasite as Schistosoma japonicum. Social Impacts Individuals at risk to infection from S. japonicum are farmers who often wade in their irrigation water, fishermen who wade in streams and lakes, children who play in water, and people who wash clothes in streams. Ablution is a religious requirement in some Muslim countries to achieve cleanliness by washing of the anal or urethral orifices after urination or defecation. However, this act leads to the transmission of schistosomiasis. The water source typically used for ablution is a contaminated river or canal from previously deposited human waste, thus furthering the contamination in the population. Important factors to influence transmission are age, sex of an individual, as well as the economic and educational level of a population. Males show the highest rates of infection, as well as the most intense infections. This may be due to occupational risk. As was the case of Suriname, the highest prevalence occurs in both sexes where both male and females work in fields. Climate change may have potential impact on the transmission of schistosomiasis in China. The development of S. japonicum in the intermediate host Oncomelania hupensis occurred at the threshold of 15.4 ¬∞C. Previously, O. hupensis has been restricted to areas where the mean January temperature has been over 0 ¬∞C. With rising climate change, it is predicted that by 2050, O. hupensis will be able to cover 8.1% of the surface area of China, thus leading to greater concern to new populations being at risk to schistosomiasis. Morphology The S. japonicum worms are yellow or yellow-brown. The males of this species are slightly larger than the other Schistosomes and they measure ~ 1.2 cm by 0.5 mm. The females measure 2 cm by 0.4 mm. The adult worms are longer and narrower than the related S. mansoni worms. By electron microscopy there are no bosses or spines on the dorsal surface of the male, which is ridged and presents a spongy appearance. Many spines cover the inner surface of the oral sucker and extend to the pharyngeal opening. The oral sucker shows a rim with spines of variable size and sharpness inward and outward from the rim. The ventral sucker possesses many spines which are smaller than in the oral sucker. The lining of the gynecophoric canal is roughened by minute spines. The integument of the female is ridged and pitted and possesses fewer spines than in the oral sucker, the ventral sucker, and the gynecophoric canal of the male. Anterior to the acetabulum, the integumental surfaces are devoid of spines. However, in the other areas, spines are equally distributed except for the vicinity of the excretory pore. The ova are about 55-85 Œºm by 40-60 Œºm, oval with a minute lateral spine or knob. Life cycle The life cycles of Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni are very similar. In brief, eggs of the parasite are released in the feces and if they come in contact with water they hatch into free-swimming larva, called miracidia. The larva then has to infect a snail of the genus Oncomelania such as species of Oncomelania hupensis within one or two days. Inside the snail, the larva undergo asexual reproduction through a series of stages called sporocysts. After the asexual reproduction stage cercaria (another free-swimming larva) are generated in large quantities, which then leave (shed into the environment) the snail and must infect a suitable vertebrate host. Once the cercaria penetrates the skin of the host it loses its tail and becomes a schistosomule. The worms then migrate through the circulation ending at the mesenteric veins where they mate and start laying eggs. Each pair deposits around 1500-3500 eggs per day in the vessels of the intestinal wall. The eggs infiltrate through the tissues and are passed in the feces. Pathology Once the parasite has entered the body and begun to produce eggs, it uses the hosts' immune system (granulomas) for transportation of eggs into the gut. The eggs stimulate formation of granuloma around them. The granulomas, consisting of motile cells, carry the eggs to the intestinal lumen. When in the lumen, granuloma cells disperse leaving the eggs to be excreted within feces. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of eggs are not excreted, instead they build up in the gut. Chronic infection can lead to characteristic Symmer's fibrosis (also known as \\"clay pipe stem\\" fibroses, these occur due to intrahepatic portal vein calcification which assume the shape of a clay pipe in cross section). S. japonicum is the most pathogenic of the schistosoma species because it produces up to 3,000 eggs per day, ten times greater than that of S. mansoni.. As a chronic disease, S. japonicum can lead to Katayama fever, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, liver portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and ascites. Some eggs may pass the liver and enter lungs, nervous system and other organs where they can adversely affect the health of the infected individual.  Disease  Schistosoma japonicum is the only human blood fluke that occurs in China, Philippines, and Sri Lanka . It is the cause of schistosomiasis japonica, a disease that still remains a significant health problem especially in lake and marshland regions. Schistosomiasis is an infection caused mainly by three schistosome species; Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma haematobium. S. japonicum being the most infectious of the three species. Infection by schistosomes is followed by an acute Katayama fever. Historical accounts of Katayama disease dates back to the discovery of S. Japonicum in Japan in 1904. The disease was named after an area it was endemic to, Katayama district, Hiroshima, Japan. If left untreated, it will develop into a chronic condition characterized by hepatosplenic disease and impaired physical and cognitive development. The severity of S. japonicum arises in 60% of all neurological diseases in schistosomes due to the migration of schistosome eggs to the brain. Symptoms an infected person might experience include: fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly and eosinophilia. https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/biology.html Diagnosis Histopathological image of old state of schistosomiasis incidentally found at autopsy. The deposition of calcified eggs in the colonic submucosa suggests prior infection of Schistosoma japonicum. Microscopic identification of eggs in stool or urine is the most practical method for diagnosis. Stool examination should be performed when infection with S. mansoni or S. japonicum is suspected, and urine examination should be performed if S. haematobium is suspected. Eggs can be present in the stool in infections with all Schistosoma species. The examination can be performed on a simple smear (1 to 2 mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed intermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by repeated examinations and/or concentration procedures (such as the formalin - ethyl acetate technique). In addition, for field surveys and investigational purposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the Kato-Katz technique (20 to 50 mg of fecal material) or the Ritchie technique. Eggs can be found in the urine in infections with S. haematobium (recommended time for collection: between noon and 3 PM) and with S. japonicum. Detection will be enhanced by centrifugation and examination of the sediment. Quantification is possible by using filtration through a Nucleopore membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane. Tissue biopsy (rectal biopsy for all species and biopsy of the bladder for S. haematobium) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative. Since the eggs of S. japonicum are small, concentration techniques may be required. Biopsies are mostly performed to test for chronic schistomiasis with no eggs. An ELISA test can be performed to test for antibodies specific to schistosomes. A positive result indicates a present or recent infection (within the past two years). Ultrasonographic examination can be performed to assess the extent of hepatic and spleen- related morbidity. The problems with immunodiagnostic methods are that 1) It is only positive a certain time after infection 2) They can cross interact with other helminthes infections. Treatment The therapy of choice is praziquantel, a quinolone derivative. Praziquantel is generally administered in an oral form in one or two doses from 40‚Äì60 mg/kg body weight. Combination treatment may prevent morbidity due to schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is most active against adult worms. However, it has been found that artemether prevents the development of adult worms, thus decreasing egg production in the host. If both praziquantel and artemether can be used together, the entire lifespan of S. japonicum would be covered in the vertebrate host. Prevention Human waste should be hygienically disposed of. Human waste in water with the Oncomelania snail intermediate host is a major cause to the perpetuation of schistosomiasis. To prevent this from occurring, human waste should never be used for nightsoiling (fertilization of crops with human waste) and unsanitary conditions should be improved. To avoid infection, individuals should avoid contact with water (including swimming and walking through water) that is contaminated by human or animal waste, especially water sources that are endemic to Oncomelania snails. Other important prevention techniques include: drinking purchased mineral water from stores and boiling water on high temperature for at least one minute before it would be used for drinking or bathing. It is important to notice, that iodine treatment does not guarantee the safety of the water. (https://www.cdc.gov/parasite/schistosomiasis/prevent.html) If necessary to enter potentially infected water, cercarial repellants and cercaricidal ointments can be applied to the skin before entering the water. Barrier cream with a dimethicone base offered high levels of protection for at least 48 hours. The search for a practical vaccine continues and could greatly benefit affected areas. Control Control against infection of S. japonicum requires multiple efforts consisting of education, eliminating the disease from infected individuals, controlling the vector. Education can be highly effective, but difficult with lack of resources. Also, asking people to change customs, traditions and behaviors can prove a difficult task. Controlling S. japonicum with molluscicide has proved ineffective because Oncomelania snails are amphibious and only frequent water to lay their eggs.

He is best known for the creation of anatomical models made of wax, many of which still survive today and are on display in the Guy's Hospital medical school museum. Life Joseph Towne was born in Royston, Hertfordshire, where his father was a preacher at the local chapel, the youngest of five surviving children. He was apprenticed to a local artist, spending two years as an assistant sculptor. When he was seventeen, Joseph Towne began work on a major project, the construction of a wax skeleton, even though he had never seen a real one. Working from books, he wanted to be accurate. He had been informed that there was a Society of Arts competition in London, so he decided to go to London where he visited doctors who examined it, but could not tell him whether it was correct. Advised to ask Astley Cooper, in April 1825, Towne met the surgeon, who wrote out a note for him: His skeleton took second place. In the following year, a wax sculpture of a head dissection made for John Hilton won the first prize. Cooper at Guy's Hospital seems to have intended to create a collection of wax medical models, because in 1825 he took Towne onto the staff. Wax head by Joseph Towne, ca 1840, showing the symptoms of syphilis (Museum of London) Towne worked for the anatomist Dr. Hilton and for Thomas Addison. Addison taught materia medica, and had need for wax moulages of diseases. Smallpox is contagious, so the students would be shown wax models rather than the real thing. Towne made eight moulages of variola, the smallpox - six days before eruption, five days, four days, three days, two days, the day before, the day of eruption and two days after. He also made three moulages of vaccinia, the cowpox. Towne had an assistant and an Italian model known as Francis - who was most probably Francesco. In the manner of a dental assistant, Towne's helper would mix up portions of plaster-of-paris for Towne to apply to the limb of Francis. Later, he would fit end-caps as needed and fill the mold with wax. Finally, the wax molding would be painted with colored wax. Towne was paid a huge retainer, as well as a large sum for each moulage. Consequently, he remained loyal to Guy's hospital. Additional work involved the making of a marble bust of Cooper - who was now Sir Astley Cooper - and of other members of staff. In 1852, he made \\"The magnificent bust by Towne\\" that was mentioned by Sir Samuel Wilks and Dr. Daldy in their \\"Collected Works of Thomas Addison\\". In 1859, the medical school at Guy's fell on hard times. It was suggested that the hospital museum should be closed to save money. That would automatically have spelled the end of Towne's career. Fortunately, the museum with its wax models continued - but in reduced circumstances. Ever loyal, Towne refused to make models for other British hospitals. His fame had spread, however, so that he made about two hundred additional moulages for faraway places such as India and the United States. Professor Charles Wheatstone had invented stereoscopy, and revealed it to the world in 1838. There was no serious prior art. Victorians immediately took to the novelty, and Towne was no exception. As one might expect, he assembled a collection of 3D images of sculptures to study. He also studied the work of Wheatstone and of Sir David Brewster. In 1862, Towne published the results of his stereoscopic researches together with a reply to the man who was now Sir Charles Wheatstone. But ever loyal to Guy's, he published in Guy's Hospital Reports. The articles, in two parts, provide a fascinating insight into the mind of Joseph Towne. For example, he argues that if one eye sees yellow and the other sees blue, the mind should see green. This is wrong. The yellow and blue that he speaks of are pigments. It is now known that when yellow and blue light are mixed, the outcome is white. But what if yellow enters the mind via one eye, and blue via the other? Such binocular colour rivalry remained uncharted territory for long. Similarly, Towne argues that one can see in three dimensions with only one eye. This is because one can sense the tension in the eye-muscles as one focuses close. However, it is not true shape-perception as defined by Wheatstone. Towne's adjustive Stereoscope is no more than a direct-viewing aid with a septum and pinhole oculars. However, it does help anybody who is attempting direct-viewing because the septum cuts out distraction whilst the pinholes extend the depth-of-field. Over the course of his career, Towne made just over a thousand moulages for Guy's hospital, eight hundred under the direction of Addison including cases of skin disease, and anatomical preparations from dissections made by John Hilton. He also made an equestrian statue of the Duke of Kent for Buckingham Palace. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery, where his monument has been destroyed.

Piggybacking on the popularity of the BSD package, Franz Lisp was probably the most widely distributed and used Lisp system of the 1970s and 1980s. The name is a pun on the composer and pianist Franz Liszt. It was written specifically to be a host for running the Macsyma computer algebra system on VAX. The project began at the end of 1978, soon after UC Berkeley took delivery of their first VAX 11/780 (named Ernie CoVax, after Ernie Kovacs, the first of many systems with pun names at UCB). Franz Lisp was available free of charge to educational sites, and was also distributed on Eunice, a Berkeley Unix emulator that ran on VAX VMS. History At the time of Franz Lisp's creation, the Macsyma computer algebra system ran mainly on a DEC PDP-10. This computer's limited address space caused difficulties. Attempted remedies included ports of Maclisp to Multics or Lisp machines, but even if successful, these would only be solutions for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as these machines were costly and uncommon. Franz Lisp was the first example of a framework where large Lisp programs could be run outside the Lisp machines environment; Macsyma was then considered a very large program. After being ported to Franz Lisp, Macsyma was distributed to about 50 sites under a license restricted by MIT's interest in making Macsyma proprietary. The VAX Macsyma that ran on Franz Lisp was called Vaxima. When Symbolics Inc., bought the commercial rights to Macsyma from MIT to sell along with its Lisp machines, it eventually was compelled to sell Macsyma also on DEC VAX and Sun Microsystems computers, paying royalties to the University of California for the use of Franz Lisp. Other Lisp implementations for the VAX were MIT's NIL (never fully functional), University of Utah's Portable Standard Lisp, DEC's VAX Lisp, Xerox's Interlisp-VAX, and Le Lisp. In 1982, the port of Franz Lisp to the Motorola 68000 processor was begun. In particular, it was ported to a prototype Sun-1 made by Sun Microsystems, which ran a variant of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix called SunOS. In 1986, at Purdue University, Franz Lisp was ported to the CCI Power 6/32 platform, code named Tahoe. The major contributors to Franz Lisp at UC Berkeley were John K. Foderaro, Keith Sklower, and Kevin Layer. A company was formed to provide support for Franz Lisp called Franz Inc., by founders Richard Fateman, John Foderaro, Fritz Kunze, Kevin Layer, and Keith Sklower, all associated with UC Berkeley. After that, development and research on Franz Lisp continued for a few years, but the acceptance of Common Lisp greatly reduced the need for Franz Lisp. The first product of Franz Inc. was Franz Lisp running on various Motorola 68000-based workstations. A port of Franz Lisp was even done to VAX VMS for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. However, almost immediately Franz Inc. began work on their implementation of Common Lisp, Allegro Common Lisp. Features The Franz Lisp interpreter was written in C and Franz Lisp. It was bootstrapped solely using the C compiler. The Franz Lisp compiler, written entirely in Franz Lisp, was called Liszt, completing the pun on the name of the composer Franz Liszt. Some notable features of Franz Lisp were arrays in Lisp interchangeable with arrays in Fortran and a foreign function interface (FFI) which allowed interoperation with other languages at the binary level. Many of the implementation methods were borrowed from Maclisp: bibop memory organization (BIg Bag Of Pages), small integers represented uniquely by pointers to fixed values in fields, and fast arithmetic. Important applications * Franz Lisp was used as the example language in Robert Wilensky's first edition of Lispcraft * An implementation of OPS5 by DEC on Franz Lisp was used as the basis for a rule-based system for configuring VAX-11 computer system orders and was important to DEC's sales of these computers * Slang: a circuit simulator used to design and test the reduced instruction set computer RISC-I microprocessor * As a derivative: Cadence Design Systems Skill programming language See also * PC-LISP is an implementation of Franz Lisp for the operating system DOS which still runs on emulators and Microsoft Windows today.

The species was originally described in 1998 in the Czech Republic and afterwards it was detected also in other European countries, e.g. Denmark, Germany, France, Iceland, Poland, Switzerland, or Russia, and even in Iran. For its unique neurotropic behaviour in vertebrate hosts, the host-parasite interactions are extensively studied in terms of molecular biology, biochemistry and immunology. Life cycle The life cycle of T. regenti is analogous to that of human schistosomes. Adult flukes mate in a nasal mucosa of anatid birds (e.g. Anas platyrhynchos, Spatula clypeata or Cairina moschata) and produce eggs with miracidia which hatch directly in the host tissue and leak outside when the bird is drinking/feeding. Once in water, the miracidia swim using their cilia and actively search for a proper molluscan intermediate host (Radix lagotis, Radix labiata, Radix peregra). In the snail, the miracidia develop into a primary sporocyst in which secondary sporocysts are formed and give rise to cercariae later on. Cercariae, infective larvae, exit the snail and penetrate the skin of an avian host. After penetration of the host's skin, they shed the immunogenic surface glycocalyx and transform to schistosomula (subadult stage, sg. schistosomulum). Schistosomula then look for peripheral nerves to use them to get to the spinal cord. Through it they continue their migration to the brain and, finally, the nasal tissue in a bill. Here, they mature, copulate and lay eggs while causing pathology (inflammatory infiltration, haemorrhages). If mammals are infected by cercariae (instead of birds), the parasites die in the skin being entrapped by immune response. The clinical manifestation of such infection is known as a neglected allergic disease called cercarial dermatitis (or swimmer's itch). In mice, especially in immunodeficient ones, migration of the parasite to the spinal cord was observed. A complete life cycle of T. regenti can be maintained under laboratory conditions using Radix lagotis and Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica as intermediate and definitive hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica) can also serve as reservoir hosts in aquaculture sites, such as rice fields. To study biology of T. regenti in mammals, C57BL/6, BALB/c a SCID mouse strains are used as accidental hosts.  Migration in vertebrate hosts  When cercariae of T. regenti find either avian or mammalian host, they penetrate its skin. For this purpose, they are equipped with cysteine peptidases present in their excretory/secretory products, which are capable of keratin and collagen degradation. Experiments with laboratory prepared recombinant form of the cysteine peptidase cathepsin B2 of T. regenti (TrCB2) confirmed its ability to cleave skin proteins (collagen, keratin and elastin). After penetration the skin, cercariae transform to schistosomula and start a migration through the host's body. They avoid penetration into blood capillaries and rather prefer entering peripheral nerves in host's limbs. Schistosomula are found in peripheral nerves of ducks and mice as soon as 1.5 and 1 day post infection (DPI), respectively. In both types of hosts, schistosomula exhibit a high affinity to the central nervous system which they enter via spinal roots. Based on recent observation by 3D imaging techniques (ultramicroscopy and micro-CT), schistosomula appear to migrate preferably through the white matter of the spinal cord in both birds and mammals. The next course of the infection differs in final and accidental hosts. In ducks, schistosomula are observed in synsacral segments of a spinal cord 3 DPI and 7‚Äì8 days latter (10‚Äì11 DPI) they reach the brain. In their final localisation (the nasal tissue), they occur 13‚Äì14 DPI and laying eggs starts 15 DPI. In mice, the first schistosomula are found in a lumbar spinal cord as early as 2 DPI and medulla oblongata is invaded the day after, but only in some individuals. Most of schistosomula stay localised in the thoracic and cervical spinal cord and only exceptionally migrate to the brain. Neither the presence of worms has been detected in a nasal cavity nor has their maturation been noticed in the nervous tissue. Schistosomula development in mice is suppressed likely due to the host immune response and/or the presence/absence of some essential (nutritional, stimulatory) host factors.  Pathology in vertebrate hosts  Cercarial dermatitis. In vertebrate hosts infected by T. regenti, pathological states might be caused by: * penetrating cercariae transforming to schistosomula in the skin, * schistosomula migrating through the central nervous system (CNS), * adults laying eggs in the nasal mucosa (only in avian hosts). Schistosomulum of T. regenti. Although mice are accidental hosts, most of the studies dealing with the pathological effects of T. regenti were conducted on this model. = Skin pathology = In the initial phase of the infection, early transformed schistosomula are localised in the skin. Information about pathology in the skin of birds has not been completed yet. In mice, immediate oedema and thickening of the site appear as early as 30 minutes after the penetration of cercariae; erythema is evident as well. Within 48 hours, inflammatory foci containing neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes and degranulating mast cells develop around the parasites. In case of repeated infections, the cellular infiltration is substantially elevated and the extensive inflammation may lead to formation of large abscesses or even epidermal and/or dermal necrosis. In humans, the clinical symptoms of cercarial penetration consist of macules/papules formation at the sites where the parasite entered the skin accompanied by intensive itching. The manifestation is more severe in previously sensitised people. This disease, caused not only by T. regenti but also by cercariae of other bird schistosome species, is called cercarial dermatitis (aka swimmer's itch). It is regarded as a neglected allergic disease. Eggs of T. regenti. = CNS pathology = The next phase of T. regenti infection is represented by schistosomula migration in the central nervous system. This is accompanied by serious neurological malfunctions in birds that suffer from leg paralysis and balance disorders. In ducks, eosinophilic meningitis with parasites surrounded by eosinophils and heterophils was noted. Additionally, leukocytes infiltrated perivascular spaces and tissues adjacent to the central canal. At this stage, schistosomula feed on nervous tissue as demonstrated by detection of oligodendrocytes and neurons in the lumen of parasite's intestine. A cysteine peptidase cathepsin B1 of T. regenti (TrCB1) localised in intestines of migrating schistosomula is capable of myelin basic protein degradation, thus probably serving for nervous tissue digestion. Nonetheless, the nervous tissue ingestion has likely only a minor pathogenic effect on the host central nervous tissue. This is underpinned by observations of leg paralysis only in immunocompromised hosts, whereas in experiments with immunocompetent mouse strains, the infected animals did not reveal any neurological disorders. The neurological symptoms originate probably in mechanical damage of the nervous tissue leading to dystrophic or even necrotic changes of neurons and axonal injury. The cause of it is large migrating schistosomula (approximately 340√ó80 Œºm) which are not destroyed by proper immune response. = Nasal pathology = In avian hosts, T. regenti reaches the nasal tissue where it mates and lay eggs. The gross pathology at this site consists of focal haemorrhages dispersed all over the mucosa. Infiltrates of lymphocytes are present around the eggs and even granulomas containing lymphocytes, eosinophils and heterophils form at later phases. Similar infiltrates are present around free miracidia, but the granuloma formation was not recorded. No cell reaction was noted in the vicinity of adult worms.  Immune response in vertebrate hosts  = Ducks = The records on cellular immune response to T. regenti in ducks are rather scarce. Cell infiltration of affected skin sites in repeatedly infected ducks was only noted, however, lacking further characterization of the infiltrating cells. In the CNS, eosinophils and heterophils surround the parasite but do not prevent its migration towards the final localisation in the nasal mucosa. Considering antibody response, anti-cercarial IgM culminates 15 DPI, while anti-cercarial IgY reaches a peak 30 DPI. Ducks infected at higher age have higher anti-cercarial IgY levels than those infected at lower age. However, the anti-cercarial IgY levels are not largely dependent on the infection dose. Several parasite antigens recognized specifically by host IgY are considered as candidates for immunodiagnostics. = Mice = The infection manifests as early type I hypersensitivity reaction and a late phase cutaneous inflammation. Cellular immune response is represented by production of pro- inflammatory (IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and IL-12p40) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in a skin of mice infected for the first time. Lymphocytes from their skin draining lymph nodes exhibit mixed Th1/Th2 polarization after exposure to parasite antigens. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 dominate in mice infected repeatedly which also secrete large amounts of histamine from mast cells. Lymphocytes from their skin draining lymph nodes produce IL-4 and IL-5 after stimulation with parasite antigens which shows Th2 polarization of host immune response. In a spinal cord, strong cellular immune response consisting of granulocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and T-cells develops in immunocompetent mice especially around the damaged schistosomula. CD3-deficient mice develop no or just mild inflammation which is accompanied by neurological symptoms due to mechanical damage caused to the nervous tissue. Activated microglia are localised in the migratory tracks of schistosomula and in the inflammatory lesions containing parasite residues. Therefore, they were suggested to take part in schistosomula destruction either alone or in cooperation with macrophages and T-cells. Hypertrophied astrocytes are located in the migratory tracks and in the proximity of the schistosomula which implies their role in immune response and tissue reparation. Murine astrocytes and microglia were shown to produce pro- inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-Œ±) and nitric oxide after in vitro exposure to parasite antigens, which supports their role in host immune response. IgM antibody response targets mainly carbohydrate epitopes of parasite molecules. Parasite-specific IgG1 and IgG2a are present as soon as 7 DPI. High levels of IgG1 and IgG2b, but no IgG2a, specific to mostly protein epitopes of cercarial homogenate are detectable as long as 150 DPI in repeatedly infected mice. The level of total IgE increases as soon as 10 DPI and remains high up to 150 DPI in reinfected mice. Increased production of antigen-specific IgG1 and total IgE, but slight decrease in antigen-specific IgG2b corroborate Th2 immune polarization in repeatedly infected individuals. = Humans = Clinical manifestation of human immune response to T. regenti infection is known as cercarial dermatitis (aka swimmer's itch). Majority of humans (82% of adults, 57% of children) who have experienced cercarial dermatitis (caused by undetermined species of bird schistosome) have increased levels of T. regenti antigen-specific IgG, but not IgE. Cercarial homogenate and excretory-secretory products of T. regenti induce basophils from humans without a history of cercarial dermatitis to degranulate and release IL-4.

House of Large Sizes was an alternative rock band from Cedar Falls, Iowa, in the United States. The band's lineup was primarily Dave Deibler and Barb Schilf, and featured a number of drummers throughout the group's run. House of Large Sizes released its first recordings in 1987, and officially disbanded on December 20, 2003. Deibler and Schilf are married and were the two consistent members of this power trio. Schilf played bass and sang; Deibler played guitar and was lead vocalist. Deibler was the band's primary songwriter. House of Large Sizes, often abbreviated HOLS, played a unique style of rock with a driving beat, many rhythmic changes, unexpected rests and false endings. Although the group's music was unusual, it drew on common influences--punk rock, funk and heavy metal. Punk shows itself in the short duration of many HOLS songs. The gut-level emotional energy of the music (largely attributable to Deibler's voice and guitar style) and the band's DIY ethic also show their punk roots. Deviating from the DIY standard, HOLS released one album, \\"My Ass Kicking Life,\\" on Red Decibel/Columbia in 1993. They worked primarily with small labels like WAR (What Are Records?) and Toxic Shock or released recordings on their own. Funk can be heard in Schilf 's bass playing and the throbbing, danceable rhythms of the music. Heavy metal elements are present in Deibler's powerful guitar technique and the short musical phrases from which the songs are constructed. Deibler and Schilf have continued to make and record music together since HOLS disbanded. Reunion shows =2013= The band headlined the Iowa music festival Gross Domestic Product at Vaudeville Mews in Des Moines, IA. The show was 4/13 at 11:30 pm.

Tensions rose in Texas during early 1835 as throughout Mexico federalists began to oppose the increasingly centralist policies of the government. In the summer, Texians elected delegates to a political convention to be held in Gonzales in mid-October. Weeks before the convention and war began, the Texian Militia took up arms against Mexican soldiers at the Battle of Gonzales. The convention was postponed until November 1 after many of the delegates joined the newly organized volunteer Texian Army to initiate a siege of the Mexican garrison at San Antonio de Bexar. On November 3, a quorum was reached in San Antonio. Within days, the delegates passed a resolution to define why Texians were fighting. They expressed allegiance to the deposed Constitution of 1824 and maintained their right to form the General Council. In the next weeks, the council authorized the creation of a new regular army to be commanded by Sam Houston. As Houston worked to establish an army independent from the existing volunteer army, the council repeatedly interfered in military matters. After authorizing an expedition to take Matamoros, Mexico, the council named several men, simultaneously, to organize and lead the assault, angry at the effect the expedition was having on existing Texian garrisons, Smith dissolved the council. Alleging that Smith did not have the authority to disband them, council members impeached him and lieutenant governor James W. Robinson was named acting governor. Background The Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821) severed Spain's control over much of its North American territories, including Texas.Manchaca (2001), p. 161. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico defined the new country as a federal republic with nineteen states and four territories. Due to limited population and extremely poor economies, the provinces of Texas and Coahuila were combined to become the state Coahuila y Tejas.Manchaca (2001), p. 162.Vazquez (1997), p. 51. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the new government liberalized immigration policies for the region. Under the General Colonization Law people from the United States could, for the first time, legally settle in Texas.Manchaca (2001), p. 164. Large tracts of land were granted to empresarios, who were responsible for recruiting settlers and establishing communities in Texas. With one exception, the new colonies were settled by foreigners.Manchaca (2001), pp. 198‚Äì9. Tejanos, Texas residents of Mexican descent, were soon vastly outnumbered by Anglos. By 1834, an estimated 30,000 Anglos lived in Coahuila y Tejas,Manchaca (2001), p. 201. compared to only 7,800 Tejanos.Manchaca (2001), p. 172. By 1833, Texas was divided into three political divisions: the Department of B√©xar, the Department of Nacogdoches, and the Department of the Brazos.Vazquez (1997), p. 69. A map of Mexico, 1835‚Äì1846, showing administrative divisions. The red areas show regions where separatist movements were active. By late 1834, the Mexican government began transitioning from a federalist model to centralism.Davis (2006), p. 112. Santa Anna overturned the 1824 Constitution, dismissed the state legislatures, and ordered all militias disbanded.Davis (2006), p. 121.Hardin (1994), p. 6. Federalists throughout Mexico were appalled. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Agust√≠n Viesca, refused to dissolve the legislature, instead ordering that the session reconvene in B√©xar, further from the influence of the Mexican army.Davis (2006), p. 122. Viesca was arrested before he reached Texas.Hardin (1994), p. 23. Citizens in the states of Oaxaca and Zacatecas took up arms. Public opinion in Texas was divided.Lack (1992), pp. 24‚Äì6. In June 1835, one group staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac.Lack (1992), p. 25. Resolutions by the city councils in Mina, Gonzales, Goliad, and Columbia denounced their actions. Civic leaders in Mina were so disgusted they called for public meetings to determine whether settlers supported independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, the ayuntamientos of both Columbia and San Felipe quickly endorsed the suggestion. They hoped that a political convention would make it quite clear that the majority of Texians did not support the radicals.Lack (1992), p. 32. After the leaders of Columbia argued forcefully for the convention, the political chief of the department of the Brazos called for a meeting of representatives of municipalities in that department on August 1. Only four of the seven appointed delegates appeared. Discovering there was no official agenda, the four men returned home without actually doing anything. As a response to the Anahuac disturbances, the commander of the Mexican army in Texas, Domingo de Ugartechea, requested reinforcements to help capture the dissidents.Lack (1992), pp. 26‚Äì28. Small groups of soldiers began arriving in early August; in response, local municipalities formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety and unofficial militias.Lack (1992), p. 31. On August 9, citizens at a public meeting in Brazoria again broached the idea of a larger political convention.Lack (1992), pp. 32-33. Other communities debated whether to participate in such a convention, and whether its goals should be simply an exchange of opinions or to create an interim government.Davis (2006), p. 132. The proposed political gathering, which became known as the Consultation, was endorsed by Stephen F. Austin, the first empresario in Texas, on September 8, which solidified support throughout the Anglo colonies.Lack (1992), p. 34. Austin became the de facto leader of the Consultation, making plans for the gathering, which would convene on October 15. He requested that each community send one delegate early, to form a Permanent Council to start gathering opinions.Davis (2006), p. 136. In the interim, hostilities between Mexican soldiers and Texian colonists increased, and in early October Texian Militia attacked a Mexican army contingent which had been sent to retrieve a cannon that had previously been loaned to Gonzales. This small skirmish marked the official start of the Texas Revolution. Gonzales became a rallying point for Texas settlers who opposed the centralist policies, and men flocked to the town.Davis (2006), pp. 140-3. On October 11, the Texian Militia formed themselves into a volunteer Texian Army and elected Austin as their commander.Winders (2004), p. 55. Many of the Consultation delegates had also gathered in Gonzales, and rather than wait for the session to begin, they joined the army on a march against the Mexican garrison at B√©xar.Winders (2004), p. 69. By October 16, only 31 delegates had arrived in San Felipe, short of a quorum.Lack (1992), p. 41. Most expected the siege of B√©xar to be over very quickly, so the Consultation was postponed until November 1. In the interim, this group of delegates granted power to the Permanent Council, which in practice included representation from only seven districts. The Permanent Council made weak attempts to govern the area, but primarily carried out Austin's orders. In its most controversial move, the council closed all land offices in the region on October 27, to prevent speculators from seizing land during the unrest.Lack (1992), p. 42. The siege of B√©xar began in late October. Newly arrived immigrant Sam Houston traveled to B√©xar to exhort the delegates to leave the siege and come to the Consultation. In a compromise, the officers voted to allow delegates who were members of the rank-and-file or were line officers to leave the siege, while those who were staff officers would remain to oversee military operations.Davis (2006), pp. 154-157. William B. Travis, William Wharton, and Stephen F. Austin remained behind, while twenty delegates, including James Bowie, accompanied Houston to San Felipe. Delegates Each municipality in Texas was encouraged to send five delegates to the convention. Some municipalities, including Nacogdoches, elected seven.Davis (2006), p. 160. A total of 98 delegates were elected. These men were established citizens, with an average length of residence of seven years, with an average age of 38. Approximately one-third of the delegates were staunch supporters of the Constitution of 1824, another third strongly advocated independence, and the remainder were unaligned.Lack (1992), p. 47. Only 58 of these men attended. None of the delegates from the war areas - B√©xar, Goliad, Refugio, Victoria, and San Patricio - appeared. This effectively ensured that there were no Tejano delegates that the Consultation.Davis (2006), p. 164. Many delegates from the other regions of Texas remained in the army or stayed home to defend their families.Lack (1992), p. 44. Because Austin and many of his Peace Party supporters were still with the army at Bexar, they were unable to provide as much influence to the gathering as expected. An overwhelming percentage of the delegates who attended were men who had previous political experience. Twenty of them had been active in the Communities of Correspondence and Public Safety in their respective towns. Formation of government A quorum finally formed on November 3, and delegates continued to arrive over the next few days.Davis (2006), p. 166. Although Austin had endorsed Lorenzo de Zavala to preside over the gathering, delegates elected Branch Tanner Archer of Brazoria.Davis (2006), p. 163. In a speech after his appointment, Archer urged his comrades \\"to divest yourselves of all party feelings, to discard every selfish motive, and look alone to the true interest of your country.\\" Before the group could move towards official business, Houston rose to a make speech. He gave thanks to many for actions taken over the recent months. His eloquence was unimportant and unnecessary, except as a means for him to become better known to the other delegates.Davis (2006), p. 165. For the remainder of the day, the delegates drafted rules of order. Similar to those used in the legislative bodies of the United States and Europe, the rules emphasized courtesy. In an unusual move, the rules prohibited delegates from abstaining from voting. As president, Archer was forbidden from voting except to break a tie. The Consultation's main purpose was to decide the overall goals of the revolution. Members of the War Party advocated for complete independence from Mexico, while Peace Party representatives wished for Texas to remain part of Mexico, but only under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. Although Austin was unable to attend, he did send a letter to the consultation, asking them to follow the Constitution of 1824 and to make it clear to Mexico that the hostilities were not an attempt for independence but instead a determination to fight for their rights as Mexican citizens. On November 4, John Wharton was named chair of a committee to determine the purpose of the war. After three full days of deliberation failed to produce a resolution, delegates began a full debate on the floor.Lack (1992), p. 48. The turning point of the discussion came when Houston, who many believed to be a staunch member of the War Party, asked the fellow delegates to refrain from declaring independence. Such a declaration would likely cause many of the people who supported the Constitution of 1824 in other parts of Mexico to refrain from supporting the Texians.Todish et al. (1998), p. 24. The Consultation compromised. On November 7, they released a resolution declaring that \\"The people of Texas, availing themselves of their natural rights, solemnly declare that they have taken up arms in defense of their rights and liberties which were threatened by the encroachments of military despots and in defense of the Republican principles of the federal constitution of Mexico of 1824.\\" The resolution further specified that Texas reserved the right to create an independent government as long as Mexico was not governed by that document. The members hoped that this wording would allow them to gain support from both federalists within Mexico and from the United States. The resolution passed 33-14. In what historian William C. Davis dubbed \\"the three shortest yet perhaps most significant resolutions in the document,\\" the delegates agreed that Texas would pay for the army, would repay any goods purchased by its agents, and would give volunteers public lands. These were powers reserved for states, and under the Constitution of 1824 Texas was not a stand-alone state. With these words, delegates violated the very constitution they had sworn to uphold.Davis (2006), p. 167. Davis asserts that this provision signified that the delegates fully intended for Texas to become an independent nation, eventually. Fifty-seven delegates signed the resolution. de Zavala translated it into Spanish, and copies in both languages were ordered to be printed and distributed to residents. A committee was immediately established to design a provisional government, with Henry Smith as chair. The committee's first proposal was a near-verbatim copy of the preamble to the United States Constitution and included a statement that Texas was now a \\"sovereign state\\".Lack (1992), p. 49. Delegates voted against this draft and insisted that the committee membership be changed. All committee members who supported independence were removed from their positions, and the new committee began deliberations anew. On November 13, this group produced a document that won approval.Lack (1992), p. 50. The new government would consist of a chief executive and a General Council who would share powers. Under the assumption that these two branches would have full cooperation, there was no system of checks and balances.Lack (1992), pp. 50‚Äì1. Believing there was no time to wait for general elections, the Consultation determined that the governor and lieutenant governor would be chosen by the delegates themselves, a practice somewhat common among states in the United States.Davis (2006), p. 168. Although Austin was nominated, he lost to Smith 31-22.Winders (2004), p. 72. James Robinson was elected lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Robinson would preside over the General Council, which would consist of one representative from each municipality.Davis (2006), p. 169. Three delegates-Austin, Archer, and Wharton-were appointed as agents to the United States to try to raise money and volunteers.Lack (1992), p. 54. Austin immediately resigned his post as commander of the volunteers; the troops elected Edward Burleson as their new leader.Davis (2006), p. 178. Houston was appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, as he had spent much of his career dealing with Indian nations. The Texians needed the support of the Indians (or at least their neutrality) to win their fight against Mexico. The Consultation officially adjourned on November 15, leaving the new provisional government in charge.Lack (1992), p. 52. General Council Sam Houston was named commander of the new Texian Army. The soldiers currently fighting near B√©xar were volunteers, who joined the army to accomplish a specific task and staunchly maintained their right to elect their own leaders. On November 13, the council officially established a regular army. Houston was appointed to command this new Provisional Army of Texas, subject to the orders of the governor. Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could not be forced to accept Houston as their commander.Winders (2004), pp. 70-2. The new army should consist of 2,500 men, who would enlist for 2-year terms in exchange for land grants. After consulting with some of the officers currently at the siege of B√©xar, notably Travis and James W. Fannin, the council chose to expand the army. On December 5 they created a Corps of Permanent Volunteers, which would have a shorter enlistment period and more autonomy.Winders (2004), pp. 76-7. This move hindered Houston's efforts to fill his regular army; most citizens preferred to join the Permanent Volunteers.Winders (2004), pp. 76, 78. On December 11, the Mexican troops in B√©xar surrendered and agreed to march south of the Rio Grande. With their departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas,Davis (2006), p. 185. and many of the Texians believed that the war was over.Hardin (1994), p. 91. Burleson resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home. Many of the men did likewise, and Frank W. Johnson assumed command of the 400 soldiers who remained.Davis (2006), p. 188. The Mexican retreat gave the Council the time to formalize the government and begin planning for the future, without the threat of attack.Lack (1992), p. 53. Little was accomplished. The new Texas government had no funds, so the military was granted the authority to impress any supplies that would be useful. This policy soon resulted in an almost universal hatred of the Council, as food and supplies became scarce, especially in the areas around Goliad and B√©xar, where Texian troops were stationed. The Telegraph and Texas Register noted that \\"some are not willing, under the present government, to do any duty...That our government is bad, all acknowledge, and no one will deny.\\"Lack (1992), p. 74. Citing an aborted coup attempt on November 25, Smith proposed a bill making it treasonous to make threats against the provisional government. The Council, by now used to \\"the governor's addiction to exaggerated and inflammatory rhetoric\\", ignored him.Lack (1992), p. 72. On December 19, a group of prominent citizens, led by Moseley Baker, Wylie Martin, and William Pettus, held a meeting in San Felipe to build support for dismantling the provisional government. They were concerned that the Council was moving too seriously towards independence instead of an adherence to the Constitution of 1824. Yet the Council had not gone far enough for some. Disillusionment with the interim government and an increased militancy among troops, whose ranks were now primarily composed of newly arrived volunteers from the United States, led to calls for a new convention. Brazoria passed a resolution asking for a convention to meet in March 1836 to declare independence. Soldiers in Goliad went a step further and drafted a declaration of independence on December 22.Davis (2006), p. 192. The Council passed a resolution to call the Convention of 1836, to meet on March 1 in Washington- on-the-Brazos.Lack (1992), p. 76. =Matamoros Expedition and collapse= Lieutenant Governor James W. Robinson became governor after the council impeached Henry Smith. In mid-November Governor Viesca, who had been freed by sympathetic soldiers, reached Goliad. The commander at Goliad, Philip Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison; many supported the governor, while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor.Lack (1992), p. 191. Viesca traveled to San Felipe to meet with the General Council, who also refused to recognize his authority as governor. Viesca joined several others in advocating a plan to attack centralist troops in Matamoros. They hoped this Matamoros Expedition would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside of Texas.Winders (2004), p. 78. The governor initially supported the plan, and asked Houston to organize the expedition; Houston appointed James Bowie to lead the expedition, but Bowie did not receive his orders for several weeks.Winders (2004), p. 79. The Council asked Burleson, the commander of the volunteers at Bexar, to lead the expedition. Burleson had already resigned, and his elected replacement, Johnson, instead received the message. While Johnson journeyed to San Felipe to meet with the Council, on December 30, Johnson's aide-de-camp, James Grant led 200 men from B√©xar to travel to Goliad to prepare for the expedition.Winders (2004), p. 80. Only 100 Texians remained at the Alamo Mission in Bexar, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James C. Neill. Neill was disgusted that Johnson had stripped the Alamo of almost all provisions and the majority of the men and sent a strong message to Houston asking for reinforcements and more supplies.36 people attend the consultation Although Bowie also appeared before the Council with his written orders from Houston to lead the Matamoros Expedition, on January 6 the Council authorized Johnson to lead the expedition. Johnson initially declined the commission, but changed his mind the following day. Without revoking Johnson's commission, the Council elected Fannin to lead the mission instead. Smith was incensed when he learned the Council had appointed their own commander for the expedition,Davis (2006), p. 190. and he became even more angry when Houston forwarded the letter from Neill, with an added note that he believed the Johnson mission was illegal, as the council had not had a quorum when it was authorized. By now, both Smith and Houston had decided that the expedition had little chance of success.Davis (2006), p. 191. Smith denounced the expedition as idiocy and labelled its supporters either fools or traitors.Hardin (1994), p. 109. He then disbanded the council until March 1 unless they agreed to renounce the Matamoros Expedition. The council determined that Smith had no authority to dismiss them.Winders (2004), pp. 90, 92. They soon impeached Smith and named the lieutenant governor, Robinson, Acting Governor. The documents forming the provisional government, however, did not grant the council the authority to impeach the governor. On January 12, Smith wrote a conciliatory letter to the council: \\"I admit that I [used] language beyond the rules of decorum\\", and declared that if the council would admit that their actions regarding the Matamoros Expedition were wrong he would reinstate them so that \\"the two branches [would] again harmonize to the promotion of the true interests of the country\\".quoted in Winders (2004), p. 92. Weary of the infighting and unsure who was actually in charge, Council members slowly stopped appearing. In the hopes of salvaging a government, Robinson appointed four members to an Advisory Committee. Soon, this dwindled to only two members. The interim government was essentially over by the end of January.Lack (1992), p. 73.

His body of work includes supporting work in big-budget mainstream productions and starring roles in independent projects in both the American and the British film industries. He has been nominated for awards such as a British Academy Film Award and a Critics Choice Award for his work. Born and brought up in Wokingham, Berkshire, Hoult was drawn to acting from a young age and appeared in local theatre productions as a child. He made his screen debut at the age of seven in the 1996 film Intimate Relations, and appeared in several television programmes between 1998 and 2001. Hoult's breakthrough role came when he portrayed Marcus Brewer in the 2002 comedy-drama film About a Boy, for which he was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer. Hoult earned wider recognition and praise for his performance as Tony Stonem in the E4 teen comedy-drama series Skins (2007‚Äì2008). His transition to adult roles began with the 2009 drama film A Single Man, for which he earned a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination, and the fantasy film Clash of the Titans (2010). He was cast as the mutant Hank McCoy in Matthew Vaughn's 2011 superhero film X-Men: First Class, a role he reprised in later instalments of the series. In 2013, Hoult played the lead title role in the fantasy adaptation Jack the Giant Slayer and starred as a zombie in romantic comedy Warm Bodies. Following a supporting role in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Hoult starred in a number of independent films before portraying various real- life figures such as Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford in the historical black comedy The Favourite (2018), the writer J. R. R. Tolkien in Tolkien (2019), and Peter III in the Hulu miniseries The Great (2020). Outside of film, Hoult voiced Elliot in Lionhead Studios' 2010 action role-playing game Fable III, appeared in the 2009 West End play New Boy, and is involved in philanthropy, supporting such charitable organisations as Teenage Cancer Trust and Christian Aid. He has a son from his relationship with American model Bryana Holly. Early life Hoult briefly attended the alt=A brown brick building in a city street with a sign that says \\"Sylvia Young Theatre School\\". In the foreground in a Ford Sierra car; in the background is some multi-coloured bunting. Nicholas Caradoc Hoult was born in Wokingham, Berkshire, to piano teacher Glenis (n√©e Brown) and pilot Roger Hoult. His middle name, Caradoc (pronounced /ka.Ààr…ëÀê.d…îk/), is Welsh and translates to \\"The Beloved One\\". His paternal great-aunt was Dame Anna Neagle, a stage and film actress active in the 1930s and 1940s. He has three siblings: an elder brother James, who is a United States-based biology student; and two sisters, Rosanna and Clarista, both of whom are television actors. Hoult spent most of his childhood at his family's residence in Sindlesham, an estate village in the borough of Wokingham. His older siblings were interested in acting and dancing from an early age, taking classes and attending auditions. As a child, he began accompanying them and developed his own interest in acting. He discussed his childhood and his relationship with his siblings in a 2011 interview with The Guardian saying, \\"[we were] pretty outdoorsy normal kids running around in the garden and making tree houses ... it was very normal\\". During Hoult's childhood, his father was regularly working away from home and his brother was away attending school. As a result, he spent most of his time with his mother and sisters; he said being raised by women might have helped him \\"steer clear of some pitfalls that guys who didn't grow up with women would fall into\\". Hoult was educated at The Coombes Infant and Nursery School and then Arborfield Church of England Junior School. He practised ballet with his sisters and took part in productions of Swan Lake and The Nutcracker with the English National Ballet. Although he initially wanted to attain advanced level certificates in English, Biology, and Psychology, in 2002, at the age of 12, he decided instead to attend acting school at Sylvia Young Theatre School. At the age of 14, he left to attend the Church of England's secondary school Ranelagh School. Hoult played trombone as a child and was a member of the local choir. Career =Early career (1996‚Äì2005)= Nicholas' acting potential was discovered at the age of three by a theatre director during a performance of a play that starred Nicholas' brother. The director was impressed at Nicholas' ability to \\"concentrate well\\" and offered him a role in his next theatre production, The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Hoult began attending auditions and at the age of five was cast in the 1996 drama Intimate Relations, his first feature-film role. He later appeared in the television programmes Casualty, Silent Witness, The Bill, Judge John Deed, and Doctors, among others. Hoult initially treated acting as a hobby rather than a potential career option; in a March 2009 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said he was not \\"in love with it ... I just enjoyed it. It was like playing for a football team. When you got a part it was great. And meeting new people. It was an exciting new world.\\" Hoult's next feature-film appearance came at the age of eleven alongside Hugh Grant in Chris and Paul Weitz's 2002 comedy-drama film About a Boy. Hoult was initially reluctant to audition for the role as the casting process was a lengthy one and interfered with his schooling. He nonetheless decided to participate in the early rounds of auditions and was eventually cast in the role of Marcus, a \\"woolly-hatted, oddball son of a suicidal, hippy-ish single mother, [who] gets bullied horribly at school\\". About a Boy was a commercial success, grossing more than $130million worldwide and receiving praise by film critics. Hoult's portrayal of a lonely schoolboy was well-received; David Thomas, writing for The Daily Telegraph, attributed the film's appeal and success to Hoult's performance. By the time the film was released, Hoult had left his junior school in Arborfield and began attending Sylvia Young Theatre School in London. He said the change was difficult; his time there was short and he preferred attending a regular school. He still did not want to pursue acting as a profession and at 14 he left Sylvia Young Theatre School in favour of Ranelagh School, a Bracknell-based Church of England day school. Hoult starred in Richard E. Grant's semi-autobiographical film Wah-Wah (2005) as Ralph Compton, a boy who is forced to deal with the disintegration of his family. The film, set in Swaziland during the 1960s, chronicles the waning years of the Swaziland Protectorate. Hoult made his debut in Hollywood with Gore Verbinski's film The Weather Man (2005) as the son of a television weather presenter (Nicolas Cage) undergoing a mid-life crisis. The film and Hoult's performance went largely unnoticed. Both Wah-Wah and The Weather Man performed poorly at the box office. =Skins and West End debut (2006‚Äì2010)= Hoult was a student at Sixth Form College Farnborough in 2006 when he was cast in the lead role of the television teenage-drama Skins. He was initially sceptical of his ability to play Tony Stonem, a manipulative, egocentric anti-hero, and identified more closely with the supporting character Sid. The programme was a success and ran for seven series, only two of which Hoult appeared in. His performance was well received; the character was popular, and Hoult garnered widespread attention. Skins won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Philip Audience Award, and Hoult was nominated for the Golden Nymph Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Critic Elliott David lauded Hoult for his performance in a 2016 retrospective review, and wrote that he \\"maintain[ed] the inexplicable core of his character throughout\\". During his time on Skins, Hoult felt overwhelmed by the attention he received and considered discontinuing acting at one point. Instead, he left school at the end of Skins first season and chose to focus solely on acting. Hoult at alt=A young, blue-eyed, Caucasian man with short, dark hair wearing a dark-blue jacket, a white shirt, and a black tie against a blurred background of yellow- green tree foliage. Hoult briefly appeared as Stefan Fredman in the pilot episode of the British television series Wallander. He later made his West End theatre debut as Mark, the protagonist in William Sutcliffe's coming-of-age play New Boy; the production premiered at Trafalgar Studios and had record- breaking ticket sales, which was mostly attributed to Hoult's popularity among viewers of Skins. The play was staged for a week in March 2009 because Hoult had committed to a part in the fantasy-adventure film Clash of the Titans (2010), filming for which was scheduled for mid-2010. Hoult's performance as Mark, a \\"ferociously bright and articulate but sexually confused sixth-former\\" received mixed responses from critics. Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph wrote that his performance was persuasive, but Lyn Gardner of The Guardian found him average and highlighted his inability to bring out the \\"unresolved sexual tension beneath [the] banter\\". Clash of the Titans was panned by critics but was a success at the box office, grossing nearly $500,000,000 worldwide. Hoult next appeared in Tom Ford's A Single Man (2009), after the actor originally cast in the role of Kenny Potter left the film a few days before filming commenced. Hoult had previously shown interest in the project and had sent a recorded audition tape; he was eventually chosen for the role of Kenny, a homosexual college student who helps a college professor, played by Colin Firth, deal with his grief. A Single Man was variously described by media outlets as the first adult role for Hoult, who described Kenny as a \\"spontaneous\\" character not simply defined by his sexuality. Because the role was his first as an American character, Hoult worked on his accent; Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph noted Ford's choice of casting British actors as Americans (Hoult and Matthew Goode) and vice versa (Julianne Moore). A Single Man opened to widespread acclaim despite reservations from critics about Ford's directorial abilities; it was a box-office success. The film earned Hoult a nomination for the BAFTA Rising Star Award at the 2010 ceremony; Kristen Stewart won the award. In 2010, Hoult voiced the character of Elliot in Lionhead Studios' action role-playing game Fable III (2010). =Commercial success with X-Men and Mad Max (2011‚Äì2016)= Hoult was cast as Nux in George Miller's action film Mad Max: Fury Road; the project spent several years in development hell because plans for a fourth film in the Mad Max franchise encountered financial difficulties. Filming was planned for mid-2010, but heavy rain caused severe delays during pre-production in Australia. With no other immediate commitments, Hoult began to look for other prospects. He was eventually cast in the role of Hank McCoy / Beast for the X-Men film series owing to his ability to play somebody \\"gentle with a capability of being fierce\\". Although earlier reports had said Benjamin Walker was to play the role, Hoult was finalised for the 2011 Matthew Vaughn-directed instalment X-Men: First Class, a prequel to the franchise's earlier films. Before filming began, Hoult familiarised himself with his character; he said he \\"formulated [his] own version of the Beast\\" and took inspiration from Kelsey Grammer's performance in the previous X-Men: The Last Stand because he wanted to emulate Grammer's charm and eloquence. Hoult learnt to speak in a dialect similar to Grammer's without trying to imitate it. He also underwent physical training and gained weight to better suit his character. The film, which was widely praised by critics for its script and performances, performed moderately well at the box office, collecting about $353million against a production budget of $160million. Although it was the lowest-ranked production in the entire series in terms of revenue, Chris Aronson of 20th Century Fox deemed it \\"an excellent start to a new chapter of the franchise\\". Hoult at the alt=A young, Caucasian man with short, dark hair and facial stubble wearing a black shirt speaks into a microphone against a grey background. Mad Max: Fury Road was eventually filmed in 2012 in the Namibian desert. Miller had conceived Nux, a terminally ill slave, as a \\"quasi kamikaze pilot\\"; Hoult said of his character; \\"he's very enthusiastic and committed and affectionate but also kind of clumsy\\". Hoult shaved his head and followed a strict diet because his role required him to lose a lot of weight. He also talked about performing stunts in the film, describing the entire experience as \\"scary\\", but favourably compared the stunt crew and Miller's choice to incorporate real action sequences instead of using a green screen, saying it made the performance more believable because the actors are placed in a real situation. Fury Road opened to critical acclaim on 14 May 2015 and grossed more than $378million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the Mad Max franchise. The technical aspects and stunt sequences drew particular praise from film critics and it was credited for reviving interest in the series. Shalini Langer noted that while the real hero of the film was Charlize Theron, \\"[Hoult] is the closest in the acting department ... as Joe's 'war boy' chasing imagined glory\\". Hoult's \\"fabulously unhinged\\" performance was also praised by Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph. Also in 2012, Hoult was included in the Forbes 30 under 30 list. In 2013, Hoult had starring roles in two major films; he first played a zombie named R in Jonathan Levine's romantic comedy Warm Bodies, which was released on 1 February. An adaptation of Isaac Marion's novel of the same name, the film is presented from point of view of the central character, mostly through narration. Levine said he had difficulties finding a suitable actor to play R until he met Hoult, who was attracted to the project‚Äîwhich he described as \\"much more than a horror movie\\" owing to the use of multiple pop culture and literary allusions‚Äîand even more so to the role which \\"bowled [me] over\\". Hoult said he drew inspiration from Edward Scissorhands (1990) because he thought the central characters in both films share the same difficulties. To prepare for the role of a zombie, Hoult and the other actors practiced with Cirque du Soleil performers; he said of the experience; \\"we would take our shoes off in a dance studio ... kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy\\". The film garnered positive response from critics and audiences. Ben Kendrick praised Hoult for the restraint in a potentially Razzie-worthy role: \\"[he] brings a lot of life to R without stepping too far in the other direction [and although his] zombie mannerisms may come across a bit forced but, overall, his memorable moments outnumber (and outweigh) the awkward ones.\\" Hoult was also described as \\"an extremely appealing actor, [who] is charm personified\\" in his role of the living-dead. Hoult's next film, Bryan Singer's 2013 fantasy adventure Jack the Giant Slayer, failed at the box office and received mixed response from critics. He played the eponymous hero in the film, which is based on the British fairy tales \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\" and \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\". Hoult's performance was poorly received by film critics Mary Pols, Justin Chang and Richard Roeper; Pols was critical of his \\"disconcerting\\" imitation of Hugh Grant and the other two dismissed him and his character as \\"bland\\" and \\"boring\\", respectively. Hoult then appeared in Jake Paltrow's science-fiction film Young Ones (2014). Set in a dystopian future where water is scarce, the film had Hoult play Flem Lever, a young man who is trying to claim the land owned by the film's central character Ernest Holm (Michael Shannon). Hoult thought the role was unlike any of his previous work and said his character's questionable choices throughout the film intrigued him. Hoult read novels written by S. E. Hinton to prepare for the role. The film was shot in a deserted location in South Africa; Hoult said filming in the hot weather conditions was difficult but the \\"beautiful\\" scenery helped to tell the story better. He and his co-star Elle Fanning said it also made them more conscious of environmental concerns. The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was met with mixed responses. Commentators highlighted the film's standout scenery but were critical of its plot. Keith Uhlich of The A.V. Club said Hoult was a poor fit for the story's \\"stoically retrograde machismo\\". Hoult reprised his role as Hank McCoy in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, his other release of 2014. Hoult said playing the character was a freeing experience for him and that it was \\"fun to suddenly be able to break loose ... when you're wearing the makeup ... you can perform big ... you get to have two very different techniques, performances.\\" He also said the lengthy make-up procedure could last up to three and a half hours. X-Men: Days of Future Past earned more than $747million worldwide, making it the highest- grossing film in the series and in Hoult's career at that time. In 2015, Hoult had three other releasesthe feature film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's mystery novel Dark Places; Owen Harris' dark comedy Kill Your Friends, based on the 2008 novel of the same name; and Equals, a dystopian, science-fiction romantic drama directed by Drake Doremusall of which were critical failures and rank among the lowest-grossing films of his career. Response to Hoult's performance in Equals was relatively better; Peter Travers dubbed him and his co-star Kristen Stewart \\"quietly devastating\\" and Katie Walsh, writing for Los Angeles Times, said the duo were \\"finely matched both in their androgynous beauty and in their performances of a repressed humanity\\". Despite doubts about his contract with the franchise, Hoult returned for the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse. Upon release, the film became the third-ranked X-Men film in terms of worldwide box office collections, earning about $540million. It was also a top-grossing production outside the United States. =Transition to biographical and independent films (2017‚Äìpresent)= The action film Collide, which had Hoult star as a drug dealer, was released in the United States in February 2017 to a poor response from audiences and critics. The film garnered negative reviews; its dismal box office performance was attributed to poor marketing and multiple delays caused by the 2015 chapter 11 bankruptcy of its production company Relativity Media. Forbes Scott Mendelson analysed the film's failure and said Hoult did not necessarily have enough \\"star power\\" to draw audiences. He also responded negatively to Felicity Jones' casting as a damsel in distress, which he said further damaged the film's chances of success. He highlighted the misogyny and sense of entitlement in the entertainment industry, writing that director Eran Creevy and Hoult would get better offers despite the failure of films like Collide, as opposed to the women and other minority groups, who are either ignored or stereotyped. Responses to Hoult's next film, the romance drama Newness, were more enthusiastic. The production had its world premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival; it stars Hoult and Laia Costa as a Los Angeles-based couple who meet through online dating and begin an open relationship. Drake Doremus, the film's director, said Hoult's role was unlike his previous work; \\"a very complex and emotionally mature performance that we haven't seen yet\\". Hoult at an event for alt=A caucasian man in a blue sweatshirt smiling at the camera. Hoult starred in a series of biographical and historical films in 2017; he said he preferred playing characters that might help him improve as an actor and that the \\"actors I look up to started doing their best work in their early 30s and I'll be hitting that age ... I'm just trying to learn\\". He portrayed American author J. D. Salinger in Danny Strong's Rebel in the Rye, which chronicles Salinger's life from his youth to the World War II era and the years preceding the publication of his debut novel, The Catcher in the Rye. Hoult auditioned for the role because he was intrigued by the film's script and Salinger's enigmatic personality; \\"I didn‚Äôt know he fought in the second world war and landed on D-Day: ... had intermittent PTSD or that he became interested in Vedanta philosophy and meditated and did yoga.\\" To prepare for the role, Hoult read The Catcher in the Rye and biographies about Salinger. Hoult said the biggest challenge was to get a real understanding of Salinger's character; \\"everyone has an idea of [Salinger] in their mind ... you're creating a character that people have very strong feelings about. You can't prove to be right or wrong through impressions.\\" Rebel in the Rye opened to a poor response from film critics. Carson Lund of Slant was largely unimpressed by Hoult's \\"feeble\\" performance and his inability to \\"reinvest the character with the complexities lost in the story‚Äôs programmatic telling\\". RogerEbert.coms Matt Fagerholm wrote that although Hoult was capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, he is never \\"quite believable as Salinger\\". Fagerholm ascribed the failure to the script, which left the character's key motivations \\"frustratingly muddled\\". Hoult co- starred with Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Shannon in The Current War, a dramatisation of the feud between electrical pioneers Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, played by Cumberbatch and Shannon respectively. Hoult was cast in the role of Nikola Tesla, for which he grew a moustache and attended science lessons about electromagnetism and dynamos. He lost weight for his role by following a strict diet. Response to The Current War was mixed; David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Hoult's performance as a tribute to David Bowie, who had previously played Tesla in The Prestige (2006). In a departure from biographical dramas, Hoult next starred as an American soldier in Sand Castle, a production he described as a very different war film \\"in terms of the pacing and the emotion ... very under the surface, that futility-of-war idea\\". He recalled the filming experience in the Jordanian military bases practising clearing procedures: ‚Äúwe put on these masks, get given these guns, are put inside this pitch-black house ... try and hunt down these bad guys hiding inside. You‚Äôre in all the gear ... the adrenaline starts pumping.\\" Released on Netflix in April 2017, the film garnered mixed reviews. In 2018, he co-starred in the critically acclaimed period drama The Favourite as Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He also appeared in the British- Irish-American animated television mini-series adaptation of Richard Adams' 1972 novel Watership Down; the mini-series is directed by Noam Murro and adapted by Tom Bidwell. He voiced one of the lead characters, Fiver. In 2019, Hoult starred as author J. R. R. Tolkien in the biopic Tolkien. He also reprised his role as Hank McCoy in the X-Men film Dark Phoenix, which was released in the same year. Hoult next starred as Peter III of Russia in the Hulu miniseries The Great, which premiered in May 2020. Personal life and other work Hoult at the alt=A young, Caucasian man with short, dark hair and facial stubble wearing a blue jacket and white shirt against a busy, outdoor background. Behind him is a man in a high-visibility jacket and a woman with an umbrella. Hoult dated American actress Jennifer Lawrence, his co-star in the X-Men films, for five years. Since March 2017, Hoult has been in a relationship with American model Bryana Holly Bezlaj. In April 2018, the couple had their first child, a son. During his childhood, Hoult played basketball for the Reading-based team Reading Rockets, which played in the English Basketball League. He was later appointed as the club's ambassador. He also follows Formula One auto racing and has attended several Grand Prix events at Montreal, Singapore, and Germany. Hoult is a philanthropist and supports numerous charities; he has been associated with organisations that support children. He was appointed the first National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) Young Person Ambassador, for supporting the charity's activities aimed at children and young people. Since 2009, he has also been involved with the Teenage Cancer Trust; he continues to visit patients supported by the organisation and has helped promote its awareness campaigns, including the sun-safety campaign \\"Shunburn\\". Hoult designed sweaters for Save the Children's and Selfish Mother's joint Christmas Jumper Day campaign. He encouraged customers to buy the festive collection and support the charitable cause, which he thought would bring a \\"real change to children's lives\\". He also donated a pair of shoes, which was auctioned by Small Steps Project, an organisation that helps homeless and malnourished children. Hoult was inducted into the NSPCC Hall of Fame in 2010, for his contributions to the campaign against child cruelty. Hoult visited Nairobi, Kenya, as a part of a Christian Aid project aimed at providing clean water and sanitation. During his stay he met local people and helped clean the locality. He said of his experience; \\"I met great people making the best of the situation ... it is heart-breaking in many ways to see the living conditions\\". Hoult also participated in the Rickshaw Run in January 2017, in which participants drove an auto rickshaw (also called a tuk tuk) for across India to raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust and World Wide Fund for Nature. He has also been associated with Jeans for Refugees, a project and fundraising initiative intended to help refugees around the world. He donated a signed pair of jeans to the organisation; profits from the campaign were donated to the refugee support agency International Rescue Committee. Filmography and awards For his role in About a Boy (2002), Hoult won the Best Youth Performance at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards and earned a nomination for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer. He was nominated for the 2010 British Academy Film Awards for Orange Rising Star Award for his role in A Single Man.

Born in New York City, New York, he obtained a B.S. degree in chemistry from Montana State University, a M.S. degree in chemistry from Washington State University, and a Ph.D. in geochemistry at the University of Chicago.  University of Chicago  Friedman was a member of the famed group of post doctoral researchers in Nobel laureate Harold Urey‚Äôs laboratory at the Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago. There, Friedman built the first mass spectrometer for routine measurement of the hydrogen isotope composition of water. Hydrogen has two stable isotopes and much can be deduced about the history of water from their proportions. Because of this, Friedman is called the \\"father of isotope hydrology.\\"  Military  Friedman joined the Navy in 1944. His USGS bio says that he was assigned to the Naval Electronics Laboratory in Washington, D.C., but that organization was formed in 1945. His training may have spanned the difference in time, though.  USGS  In 1952, he joined the USGS in Washington, D.C., and worked for the USGS for more than 43 years. In 1962, he moved to Lakewood, Colorado, when the Isotope Geology Branch of the USGS was created. Friedman retired from the USGS in 1995, and remained active as an emeritus scientist.  Accomplishments  His scientific career was a pursuit of the understanding of every aspect of the water cycle. Throughout his career, he studied water in oceans, rivers, lakes, glaciers, the atmosphere, magmas, minerals, rocks, meteorites, plants, animals and the moon. He made major contributions to a number of fields through application of stable isotope geochemistry. Friedman also made significant contributions to the development of instruments to detect helium in exploring uranium, thorium, petroleum and natural gas and in predicting earthquakes. In the 1940s, he made major contributions to the science of hydrothermal growth of quartz which made possible the development of the synthetic quartz industry.

Unlike its relatives, which are for the most part substantial trees and shrubs, C. canadensis is a creeping, rhizomatous perennial growing to about tall.  Description  Cornus canadensis is a slow-growing herbaceous perennial growing 10-20 cm tall, generally forming a carpet-like mat. The above-ground shoots rise from slender creeping rhizomes that are placed 2.5-7.5 cm deep in the soil, and form clonal colonies under trees. The vertically produced above-ground stems are slender and unbranched. The leaves are oppositely arranged on the stem, but are clustered with six leaves that often seem to be in a whorl because the internodes are compressed. The leafy green leaves are produced near the terminal node and consist of two types: 2 larger and 4 smaller leaves. The smaller leaves develop from the axillary buds of the larger leaves. The shiny dark green leaves have 2 to 3 mm long petioles and leaf blades that are obovate. The blades have entire margins and are 3.5 to 4.8 cm long and 1.5 to 2.5 cm wide, with 2 or 3 veins and cuneate shaped bases and abruptly acuminate apexes. In the fall, the leaves have red tinted veins and turn completely red. =Flowers= Mature and immature flowers, Bonnechere Provincial Park, Ontario In late spring to midsummer, white flowers are produced that are in diameter with reflexed petals that are ovate-lanceolate in shape and long. Inflorescences are made up of compound terminal cymes, with large showy white bracts that resemble petals. The bracts are green when immature. The bracts are broadly ovate and long and wide, with 7 parallel running veins. The lower nodes on the stem have greatly reduced rudimentary leaves. The calyx tube is obovate in shape and 1 mm long, covered with densely pubescent hairs along with grayish white appressed trichomes. Stamens are very short, being 1 mm long. The anthers are yellowish white in color, narrowly ovoid in shape. The styles are 1 mm long and glabrous. Plants are for the most part self-sterile and dependent on pollinators for sexual reproduction. Pollinators include bumblebees, solitary bees, beeflies, and syrphid flies.Barrett, Spencer C.; Helenurm, Kaius. 1987. The reproductive biology of boreal forest herbs. I. Breeding systems and pollination. Canadian Journal of Botany. 65: 2036-2046. The fruits look like berries but are drupes. =Release of pollen= Each flower has highly elastic petals that flip backward, releasing springy filaments that are cocked underneath the petals. The filaments snap upward flinging pollen out of containers hinged to the filaments. The stamen accelerate at a rate of 24,000 m/s. This motion takes place in less than half a millisecond and the pollen experiences two to three thousand times the force of gravity.A record-breaking pollen catapult at Academia.edu The bunchberry has one of the fastest plant actions found so far requiring a camera capable of shooting 10,000 frames per second to catch the action. =Fruit= Immature flowers Fruit The drupes are green, globose in shape, turning bright red at maturity in late summer; each fruit is 5 mm in diameter and contains typically one or two ellipsoid-ovoid shaped stones. The fruits, coming into season in late summer, are edible but not appetizing. The large seeds within are somewhat hard and crunchy. Taxonomy While distinctive as a species itself, the generic placement of these plants has differed in various botanical treatments. When the genus Cornus is taken broadly, as done here, this species is Cornus canadensis, and is included in the subgenus Arctocrania. However, if Cornus is treated in a narrower sense, excluding this species, it can instead be classified as Chamaepericlymenum canadense or as Cornella canadensis.Eyde, R. H. 1987. The case for keeping Cornus in the broad Linnaean sense. Systematic Botany. 12(4): 505-518.Eyde, Richard H. 1988. Comprehending Cornus: puzzles and progress in the systematics of the dogwoods. Botanical Review. 54(3): 233-351. Where bunchberry, a forest species, and Cornus suecica, a bog species, grow near each other in their overlapping ranges in Alaska, Labrador, and Greenland, they can hybridize by cross-pollination, producing plants with intermediate characteristics.Neiland, Bonita J. 1971. The forest-bog complex of southeast Alaska. Vegetatio. 22: 1-64.Murrell, Zack E. 1994. Dwarf dogwoods: Intermediacy and the morphological landscape. Systematic Botany 19: 539-556. Habitat Cornus canadensis is a mesophytic species that needs cool, moist soils. It inhabits montane and boreal coniferous forests, where it is found growing along the margins of moist woods, on old tree stumps, in mossy areas, and among other open and moist habitats. Ecology Birds are the main dispersal agents of the seeds, feeding on the fruit during their fall migration. In Alaska, bunchberry is an important forage plant for mule deer, black-tailed deer and moose, which eat it throughout the growing season.Hanley, Thomas A.; Cates, Rex G.; Van Horne, Beatrice; McKendrick, Jay D. 1987.

He underwent treatment in Kuwait, and later in London, where he was fitted with robotic prosthetic arms, paid for by the Kuwaiti government. He no longer uses the arms, having found them too heavy and unwieldy, although he wore artificial arms while attending school so as not to draw attention to himself. He attended the Hall School Wimbledon. Citizenship On January 1, 2010, it was announced Ali Abbas would get a British passport. Ali had offers from other countries, such as Canada and the United States, but he turned them down because they would not take his friend with him. Publicity In 2004, The Ali Abbas Story was written about Ali by Jane Warren and published by Harper Collins. He was featured on 60 Minutes on 13 May 2007. He was featured in the September 2011 edition of Time Magazine. He was interviewed by Time Magazine. Limbless Association The Limbless Association (LA) set up a dedicated fund to assist those rendered amputees by the Iraq conflict. During a visit to Iraq LA Chairman Zafar Khan met Ahmad Hamza, a 14-year-old boy who had also been injured in the Iraq conflict, resulting in his right leg and left hand being amputated. The Limbless Association pledged to use the Ali Fund to help both Ali and Ahmad. LA was the legal guardian for both Ali and Ahmad until they reached 18 years of age. The Baghdad Bikers Ali and his friends go on a publicity bike ride every year, called The Baghdad Bikers.

The movie is based on the true-life murder of Lancaster native Laurie Show. Plot The movie follows 16-year-old Laurie Show (Jennifer Finnigan), a naive and trusting girl that became entangled in the lives of Lisa Michelle Lambert (Marne Patterson) and her boyfriend Lawrence Yunkin. Laurie was initially befriended by Michelle, who later turned on her after Laurie was raped by Lawrence. Believing that Laurie was lying about the rape and that she had pursued Lawrence, Michelle began harassing and stalking Laurie, often with the assistance of friends. This harassment culminated in Michelle murdering Laurie in her home with the help of her friend Tabitha Buck. Laurie's mother discovered the body and Michelle, Lawrence, and Tabitha were quickly arrested. Lawrence pleaded guilty and testified against the other two girls in exchange for a reduced sentence, with Michelle and Tabitha receiving life sentences without parole.

The Sun-Sentinel criticized the film as \\"pointlessly violent\\" and stated that \\"[t]he only people who should be more ashamed of it than USA and Raphael -- who obviously won't be -- are those who encourage more such trash by watching\\". The Stalking of Laurie Show was also criticized for \\"[distorting] the truth\\", with an article in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal stating that Lambert was not the \\"90210-style prom queen\\" nor Show the outcast that they were portrayed as in the film. The reporter went on to argue that the changes to the film, along with the sexual content \\"designed only to titillate\\", was largely unnecessary and detracted from the crime itself.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for parts of 19 seasons. He played with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Tampa Bay Rays before playing one season at the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan. Ramirez is recognized for having great batting skill and power. He was a nine-time Silver Slugger and was one of 27 players to hit 500 career home runs. His 21 grand slams are third all-time, and his 29 postseason home runs are the most in MLB history. He appeared in 12 All-Star Games, with a streak of eleven consecutive games beginning in 1998 that included every season that he played with the Red Sox. Ramirez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. When he was 13 years old, he moved to New York City with his parents, Onelcida and Aristides. He attended George Washington High School and became a baseball standout. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 1991 MLB draft, 13th overall. He made his MLB debut on September 2, 1993. In 1994, Ramirez became a major league regular, and finished second in voting for the Rookie of the Year Award. By 1995, he had become an All-Star. He was with the Indians in playoff appearances in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999; this included an appearance in the 1995 and 1997 World Series. In 1999, Ramirez set the Indians' single-season RBIs record with 165 RBIs. After the 2000 season, Ramirez signed with the Boston Red Sox. During his time in Boston, Ramirez and teammate David Ortiz became one of the best offensive tandems in baseball history. Ramirez led the Red Sox to World Series Championships in 2004 and 2007 before being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 as part of a three team deal that also involved the Pittsburgh Pirates. In Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating baseball's drug policy by taking human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug that is often taken after steroids. In the spring of 2011, Ramirez was informed by MLB of another violation of its drug policy, and a 100-game suspension. He chose to retire on April 8 rather than be suspended. However, in September 2011, Ramirez wished to be reinstated and agreed in December with the league to a reduced 50-game suspension. Though he played at various points in the Oakland Athletics, Texas Rangers, and Chicago Cubs systems, as well as internationally, Ramirez did not appear in another Major League game. Known as a complete hitter who could hit for both power and average, and widely regarded as one of the best right handed hitters of his generation, Ramirez finished his career with a lifetime .312 batting average, 555 home runs (15th all time), and 1,831 RBI (18th all time). In 111 postseason games, Ramirez posted a .285 batting average with 29 home runs and 78 RBI. Early life Ramirez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent 13 years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers to be one of his most prized possessions. In 1985, he moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He often played ball at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays, who had his Dominican heroes George Bell and Tony Fern√°ndez on its roster; he attended games when the Blue Jays were in town. Ramirez attended George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving at the age of 19 without graduating. During his time on the team, GWHS was seeing a large increase in the number of immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very modest. During his time at GWHS, he led his team to three straight division championships. He was a three-time all-city selection in baseball, and as a high school senior was named New York City Public School Player of the Year in 1991, hitting for a .650 batting average with 14 home runs in 22 games. He was inducted into the New York City Public School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. Career =Minor leagues= The Cleveland Indians selected Ramirez with the 13th pick of the 1991 draft and gave him a $250,000 signing bonus. He was assigned to the Rookie-level Burlington Indians for his professional debut. He was named the Appalachian League MVP and was selected by Baseball America as short-season Player of the Year while slugging 19 homers and driving in 63 runs in 59 games, while leading the league in slugging and total bases. With the Single-A Kinston Indians in 1992, Ramirez battled injuries but still hit .278 with 13 homers and 63 RBIs in 81 games and was named as the number three prospect and the \\"Most Exciting Player in the Carolina League\\" by Baseball America. In 1993, Ramirez was named \\"Minor League Player of the Year\\" by Baseball America while hitting .333 with 31 homers and 115 RBIs in 129 combined games with the Double-A Canton‚ÄìAkron Indians and Triple-A Charlotte Knights. =Cleveland Indians (1993‚Äì2000)= Ramirez bats in 1996 1993‚Äì1994 Ramirez made his major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the Minnesota Twins, going hitless in four at bats as the designated hitter. The following day, when the Indians took on the New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many of his family and friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against M√©lido P√©rez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats. In 1994, his first full season in the majors, Ramirez had a strong start to the season, hitting six home runs during the month of April. Despite a weak start to May, he rebounded in the latter half of the month, finishing the month with a .300 batting average. During the season, the Indians were chasing the Chicago White Sox for first place in the American League Central (AL Central) division all the way until the end of the season. However, the team's season ended in August due to the 1994 MLB strike. Ramirez finished second in the Rookie of the Year award voting after batting .269 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs in 91 games. 1995‚Äì1997 Ramirez's breakout season came in 1995, when he batted .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs. In July, he was selected to his first All-Star Game and won his first career Silver Slugger Award following the season. That year, the Indians reached the postseason, and Ramirez hit two home runs in the 1995 American League Championship Series against the Mariners, which the Indians won in six games. The Indians then took on the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, and Ramirez batted .222 with one home run in the Indians' six-game loss. In December 1995, Ramirez agreed to a $10.15 million, four-year contract. Ramirez continued to hit well in 1996, batting .309 with 33 home runs and 112 RBIs. The Indians again reached the playoffs, and Ramirez batted .375 with 2 home runs in the Indians' loss to the Orioles in the 1996 American League Division Series. In 1997, Ramirez's contact continued to improve, though his power dipped slightly, as he hit .328 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs. This year, the Indians again reached the World Series, and Ramirez batted .154 with two home runs as the Indians lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. 1998‚Äì2000 In 1998, Ramirez experienced a great increase in power, on his way to becoming one of the great run producers in the game. He batted .294 with 45 home runs and 145 RBIs, and was selected to his second All-Star Game, where he recorded a sacrifice fly and RBI. Ramirez batted .357 with 2 home runs during the ALDS versus the Red Sox, which the Indians won in four games. In the ALCS against the Yankees, Ramirez batted .333 with two home runs, but the Indians lost in six games. Following the season, Ramirez came in sixth place in AL MVP voting. Ramirez began 1999 on a hot streak, hitting .337 with 7 home runs in the month of April. Ramirez's hot hitting continued all season, as he batted .364 in May and reached the All- Star break with 25 home runs and 96 RBIs. At the time, it was the third highest single season total for RBI by the All-Star Break in MLB history, behind only Hank Greenberg (103 in 1935) and Juan Gonz√°lez (101 in 1998). On September 30, 1999, Ramirez broke the Indians' single-season RBI record (previously 162 by Hal Trosky in 1936) by hitting a 3-run home run, giving Ramirez 164. Despite missing 15 games, he finished 1999 with 165 RBIs, the highest total by any player since Jimmie Foxx (1938), and batted an eye popping .383 against left handed pitchers. He also batted .383 with runners in scoring position, and .377 with men on base. That season, he finished third in the voting for the AL MVP award. However, he struggled in the 1999 postseason, going 1-for-18 as the Indians were eliminated by the Boston Red Sox in 5 games in the 1999 American League Division Series. In 2000, Ramirez was limited to 118 games due to injuries, but recorded a career-high .351 batting average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs. His return is believed to have started a major comeback that led the Indians to a final record of 90‚Äì72 and cut the number of games they were behind the leader of the AL Central, the Chicago White Sox, from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in just a month. Because of his return, Roberto Alomar, Omar Vizquel, and Kenny Lofton all started getting better pitches to hit, which also significantly increased their batting averages. Despite the comeback, the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the White Sox in the AL Central. With free agency looming, Ramirez homered in his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at Jacobs Field. =Boston Red Sox (2001‚Äì2008)= 2001‚Äì2003 Ramirez asking the first base umpire if he went around on a swing In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119 million contract. While this would have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was rejected by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking a ten-year, $200 million contract. Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20 million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing the total value of the contract to $200 million for 10 years. Ramirez immediately delivered for the Red Sox, hitting .408 in April 2001. He had another sterling first half, amassing a .335 batting average with 26 home runs and 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled down the stretch, finishing at .306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park, with the second one hitting the very top of the light tower in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet, second-longest by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of Ted Williams' 1946 record of 502 feet. He also launched a prodigious home run in an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the SkyDome, which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001. Ramirez, primarily a right fielder in his career to this point, spent most of the season as the designated hitter for the Red Sox. This was due to the Red Sox' belief that Ramirez was best suited to left field due to the presence of Trot Nixon in right, as well as the injuries Ramirez battled during the 2001 season. After signing with the Red Sox, Ramirez played only 7 more games in right field, all of which came during the 2002 season. Ramirez only played in 120 games in 2002 due to a hamstring injury that put him on the disabled list (DL) from mid-May to the end of June. Despite this, Ramirez won the AL batting title, hitting .349 (including .438 against lefties), and his .647 slugging percentage was second in the league behind Jim Thome's .677. Like clockwork, Ramirez again reached the 30 home run and 100 RBI plateaus, posting 33 and 107 respectively. He hit his 300th career home run on August 26 against the Angels' Ram√≥n Ortiz. It was the first of two home runs on the night for Ramirez, as he went 5-for-5 overall. However, the Red Sox again failed to qualify for the MLB postseason in 2002. In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong offensive numbers, finishing with a .325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two punch in the middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was just talking to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three- run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run. During the offseason that followed, the new Red Sox ownership (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his high level of production. Believed to be necessary in pursuit of a trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball. Also noteworthy from 2003 (though it was not revealed until 2009), according to the New York Times, Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs that season from the \\"survey\\" drug test, in which MLB players were tested to see if drugs were being used. Players faced no penalties or sanctions for testing positive.Verducci, Tom, \\"The Short Goodbye\\", Sports Illustrated, April 18, 2011, pp. 39‚Äì41. Ramirez was one of 104 players to have allegedly tested positive. 2004 Ramirez at the Red Sox victory parade In 2004, Ramirez led the AL in home runs (43), slugging percentage (.613) and OPS (1.009); he finished second in errors committed as a left fielder (7), third in RBIs (130), fourth in doubles (44) and total bases (348), sixth in on-base percentage (.397), eighth in walks (82), tenth in runs (108), and posted a .308 batting average. He also led the AL in salary, at $22.5 million. In addition, Ramirez and teammate David Ortiz became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1931. Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the Detroit Tigers' Hank Greenberg and Rudy York and later matched by the Chicago White Sox's Frank Thomas and Magglio Ord√≥√±ez. In the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Ramirez hit a two-run home run off Roger Clemens in the top of the first inning, giving his teammates a 3‚Äì0 lead. Ramirez, Derek Jeter (with a single), Ichiro Suzuki (with a double) and Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez (with a triple) became the first All-Star quartet that combined to hit for the cycle during the same inning. The Red Sox again qualified for the postseason, and Ramirez continued his hot hitting. He hit .385 in the 2004 ALDS, leading the Red Sox to a sweep over the Anaheim Angels, and setting up a rematch in the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Yankees. Despite not driving in a run in the ALCS, Ramirez hit .300 as the Red Sox completed a historic comeback from down 3 games to 0 to win in seven against the Yankees, setting up a showdown with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series as the Red Sox attempted to end the Curse of the Bambino and win their first championship since 1918. Ramirez proceeded to hit .412 with a home run and 4 RBI in a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals, as the Red Sox won their first title in 86 years. His home run came in the first inning of Game 3, off Cardinals starter Jeff Suppan, continuing a streak throughout the Series where the Red Sox scored in the first inning of each game. Ramirez's 2004 season was capped off by being named World Series MVP. Ramirez also finished third in AL MVP voting, just ahead of teammate Ortiz, who finished fourth. 2005‚Äì2006 On May 15, 2005, Ramirez hit his 400th home run off Gil Meche of the Seattle Mariners. On July 5, Ramirez hit his 20th career grand slam ‚Äî and his third of the season ‚Äî off Chris Young of the Texas Rangers. On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with 7. He posted his highest single season RBI total as a Red Sox in 2005, driving in 144 runs to go along with his 45 homers, but he batted only .292, his first time under .300 since 1998. Along with teammate David Ortiz, who drove in 148 runs, the duo combined to drive in an outstanding 292 runs. Ortiz finished second, and Ramirez fourth, in MVP voting to winner Alex Rodriguez. Off the field, the season was one of much conflict for Ramirez. Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the New York Mets) dogged him all season. After the Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of that year's playoffs by the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox, Ramirez once again expressed a wish to be traded. This included a threat to not show up for spring training if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his Ritz-Carlton condominium up for sale. Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the Baltimore Orioles or the New York Mets, but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand. His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open to a trade. But no deal materialized. On June 10, 2006, Ramirez became the 31st player in history to hit 450 home runs, with a solo home run off Francisco Cordero of the Texas Rangers. Three weeks later, on July 1, he collected his 2000th hit. Beginning in mid-July, he had a 28-game hitting streak, including 12 multi-hit games, 8 HR, and 28 RBIs. He reached 100 RBI for the 9th consecutive season on August 20 in a series against the Yankees, but missed 28 games from mid-August on with soreness in his right knee. Ramirez finished at .321 with 35 home runs and 102 RBI. He also drew a career high 100 walks in 2006, the only time in his career he reached that mark. However, the Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2002 season. 2007‚Äì2008 Ramirez in June 2007 On April 22, 2007, Ramirez was the first of four Red Sox batters to homer in consecutive at bats in a game against the New York Yankees pitcher Chase Wright, tying a league record when J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek followed Ramirez with longballs of their own. On April 29, Ramirez became the fifth player to hit 50 career home runs against the Yankees. Ramirez finished 2007 with a .296 batting average, 20 home runs, and 88 RBIs, ending his streak of 30 home run and 100 RBI seasons at 9. His season was cut short when he strained his left oblique in late August during a Yankees series, but he did return to the lineup for the final homestand of the season. In 2007, he had the highest fielding percentage (.990) among left fielders in the AL, tied for second in the major leagues; he was ranked sixth-highest in range factor of all AL left fielders, 1.72, 16th in both leagues, but had the lowest zone rating among MLB left fielders with 100+ games (.713). He made two errors during the 2007 season in left field, and tied for fifth overall in the major leagues in assists from left field. In the postseason, Ramirez hit a walk-off three-run home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, breaking a 3-3 tie as he launched the ball over Fenway Park's Monster seats beyond the left field wall. In the fourth inning of the series' final game, Ramirez combined with teammate David Ortiz to hit back-to-back home runs off pitcher Jered Weaver. The home run tied him with Bernie Williams for first place all-time in postseason home runs with 22. The Red Sox advanced to the 2007 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians where, on October 13, Ramirez hit his 23rd postseason home run, passing Williams for the most all-time. He helped the Red Sox to reach and win the 2007 World Series, where they swept the Colorado Rockies, by batting a combined .348 with 4 home runs and 16 RBI in the postseason. Ramirez earned his second World Series ring, as the Red Sox earned their seventh title. 2008 opened with Ramirez and the Red Sox defending their crown, and with Ramirez himself stating he wanted \\"to play six more years and then retire as a member of the Red Sox.\\" Ramirez played in his 2,000th game on May 26, 2008 against Seattle. On May 31, 2008, Ramirez hit his 500th home run, against Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chad Bradford at Camden Yards in the seventh inning on the first pitch. He became the 24th player in MLB history to do so. He joined two other Boston legends, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams, to have joined the exclusive home run club as a member of the Red Sox. A heated altercation between Ramirez and teammate Kevin Youkilis took place on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez had been slow to join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard. Later in the season, during a series with the Houston Astros, Ramirez had a physical altercation with elderly Red Sox traveling secretary Jack McCormick. The two were arguing over McCormick's inability to fill Ramirez's large game-day request for 16 tickets to the game in Houston. Ramirez pushed the 64-year-old McCormick to the ground after telling him \\"Just do your job.\\" The two were quickly separated and Ramirez later offered a public apology but did not apologize to McCormick in person until 2014. The matter was dealt with internally, and Ramirez was fined $10,000‚Äì15,000. On July 25, after sitting out a game against the Seattle Mariners with a sore knee, Ramirez was slated to start against the Yankees. However, several minutes before the game, he informed manager Terry Francona, through a bench coach, that he would not be playing. During the series, Ramirez was directed to an area hospital for MRIs on both his knees; the results showed no damage.Roger Rubin, New York Daily News, July 26, 2008, \\"Suddenly, Manny Ramirez's knee OK against Yankees at Fenway\\" When back in action, Ramirez frequently failed to run out ground balls. Assuming that this was due to his displeasure about his contract situation (Ramirez could become a free agent at season's end, but the Red Sox held 2 years of team options they had not yet exercised), many Red Sox fans and reporters, including Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, called for Ramirez to be traded. Despite all these distractions, Ramirez did continue to hit solidly when on the field, as he batted .299 with 20 home runs and 68 RBI through the first 100 games of the season. =Los Angeles Dodgers (2008‚Äì2010)= 2008 \\"Mannywood\\" banner in Downtown Los Angeles On July 31, 2008, Ramirez was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way deal. The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder Jason Bay and minor league infielder Josh Wilson, and the Pittsburgh Pirates got infielder Andy LaRoche and pitching prospect Bryan Morris from the Dodgers and outfielder Brandon Moss and pitcher Craig Hansen from the Red Sox. Ramirez had always worn uniform number 24, but the Dodgers had retired that number in honor of Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston. Ramirez instead chose to wear number 99 with the Dodgers. After going 2-for-4 in his first game as a Dodger, Ramirez never looked back. He hit his first Dodger home run the following day in another 2-for-4 performance. Manny went on to be named the NL Player of the Month for August 2008, touching off \\"Mannywood\\" in Los Angeles. He hit .415 (44-for-106) with seven doubles, nine home runs, 25 RBIs and 21 runs scored during the month. He finished the season with the Dodgers by batting .396 with 17 home runs and 53 RBI in just 53 games, remarkable numbers for a 36 year old. His combined totals were a .332 batting average, 37 home runs, and 121 RBI. Among all major leaguers, Ramirez finished 2008 third in batting average, second in slugging percentage, and third in OPS. With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers won the NL West, then swept the Chicago Cubs in the Division Series before losing in the NLCS to the eventual World Series winning Philadelphia Phillies in five games. During the playoffs, Ramirez hit an astounding .520 with 4 home runs, 2 doubles, 11 walks and 10 RBIs. Ramirez was fourth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, with 138 points, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, and Ryan Braun; this was remarkable for someone who played less than half a season in the NL. After the Dodgers lost in the playoffs, Ramirez, a free agent to be, was asked about his future. \\"Gas is up, and so am I\\", was his reply, indicating that he expected to be valued highly in the free agent market. After long and contentious negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed a two-year $45 million contract to remain with the Dodgers on March 4. 2009 Ramirez during his tenure with the Dodgers Ramirez began 2009 at a highly productive pace as well. Through May 7, he was batting .348 with 6 home runs and 20 RBI. But on that date, Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program established by MLB and the MLB Players Association in 2004. In the announcement by MLB, Ramirez was suspended for unspecified violation of the agreement section 8.G.2. Shortly afterward, Ramirez stated that a physician had unknowingly prescribed a banned medication. After consulting with the players association, Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension. According to an ESPN report, the drug used by Ramirez was human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug typically used by steroid users to restart their body's natural testosterone production as they come off a steroid cycle. It is similar to Clomid, the drug Jason Giambi and others used as clients of BALCO. Testing revealed artificial testosterone, too. As a condition for returning from the suspension, Ramirez was subject to three additional drug tests per year in addition to the minimum of two per player. During his suspension, Ramirez was allowed to work out at the Dodgers' facilities and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into the dugout where he remained the rest of the game. On July 21, Ramirez hit his 537th career home run, passing Mickey Mantle for 15th place on the all-time home run list. On July 30, The New York Times reported that Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during Major League Baseball's 2003 survey testing. Ramirez, a member of the Boston Red Sox at the time, was among 104 major league players to test positive. Manny finished 2009 with a .290 batting average, 19 home runs, and 63 RBI in 104 games. He added a home run and 4 RBI in the 2009 MLB postseason (batting .281), but the Dodgers were again eliminated by the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS. 2010 On April 10, 2010, Ramirez recorded his 2,500th career base hit with an infield single against the Florida Marlins. On April 18 against the San Francisco Giants, Ramirez hit his 548th career home run to tie Mike Schmidt for the 14th place on the all-time home run list. He hit his 549th to pass Schmidt on May 28 against the Colorado Rockies. On June 19, he hit a home run in his second game back at Fenway Park. In 2010, Ramirez had three separate stints on the disabled list. When he returned from the third trip on August 21, he apparently had lost his starting job to Scott Podsednik. As a pinch hitter, he was ejected on August 29 by home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom one pitch into his at-bat for arguing a strike call. That appearance was his final one in a Dodger uniform. He batted .311 with 8 homers and 40 RBI in only 66 games as a Dodger in 2010 before being placed on waivers. =Chicago White Sox (2010)= 2010 After being placed on waivers by the Dodgers, Ramirez was claimed by the Chicago White Sox. The Dodgers awarded Ramirez to the White Sox on August 30, receiving no prospects, but with the White Sox assuming the $3.8 million remaining on Ramirez's salary. At the time, the White Sox hoped to bolster their offense for a playoff push. However, Ramirez hit .261 with just one home run and two RBI in his 24 games with the White Sox. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season, which ended with the White Sox finishing 88-74, 6 games out of first place in the AL Central, and missing the postseason. =Tampa Bay Rays (2011)= 2011 On January 21, 2011, Ramirez agreed to a one-year, $2 million deal with the Tampa Bay Rays, who also signed his former Red Sox teammate Johnny Damon in a package deal suggested by agent Scott Boras. The signing initially looked like a bargain as Ramirez was among the better hitters in spring training, hitting .311 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI. However, the 38-year-old Ramirez abruptly retired on April 8, 2011, after batting .059 (1-for-17) in his first five games with no home runs and a single RBI. Ramirez reportedly tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug in spring training. His first sample, or A sample, was retested and again returned a positive result. Ramirez filed a notice to appeal, and his second sample, or B sample, was tested under observation by Ramirez' representatives. When the B sample also tested positive, he dropped the appeal and told MLB that he would immediately retire. MLB issued a statement that Ramirez had been informed of an issue under the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment program, and chose to retire rather than continue with the appeal process. Ramirez was facing a 100-game suspension, which would still apply if he decided to return to MLB in the future. Neither Ramirez nor the MLB Players Association issued a statement about the sudden retirement. Ramirez apparently did not personally inform the Rays about his decision. The team announced that they had been informed of his retirement by the MLB Commissioner's Office. =Reinstatement= In September 2011, reports surfaced that Ramirez was planning on playing in the Dominican Winter League for the Cibao Eagles. In a statement, the team said that Ramirez hoped to motivate other MLB stars to play in the country. However, the MLB Commissioner's Office issued a statement that since the Dominican League is affiliated with MLB, Ramirez was not eligible to play without first serving his mandated suspension. Upon hearing that his plans to play in the winter league would not work, Ramirez decided that he was willing to serve his 100-game suspension for the second violation of the drug policy, and to request reinstatement with MLB. He stated that he was not prepared for retirement, that he was available for any MLB team, and if none showed interest, then he would \\"play in Japan or some other place.\\" On December 4, it was announced that Ramirez had formally filed papers with the league to be reinstated to baseball and that an agreement had been reached between MLB and the Players Association that he needed to serve only a 50-game suspension instead of 100 games. =Comeback attempts= Oakland Athletics system (2012) On February 20, 2012, Ramirez signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. The deal called for a $500,000 salary if he made the MLB roster. However, he needed to serve his 50-game suspension before he could play for the team. He was eligible to play on May 30, 2012. With the Sacramento River Cats he hit .302 in 17 games, but had no homers and only a .349 slugging percentage. On June 15, Ramirez requested and was given his outright release by the Athletics. EDA Rhinos (2013) Ramirez playing baseball in Taiwan. Ramirez played in the Dominican Professional Baseball League during the 2012‚Äì13 offseason, registering a .793 OPS for the √Åguilas Cibae√±as. He signed with the newly renamed EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan for the 2013 season. He made his debut on March 27 against Brother Elephants. In 49 games, Ramirez batted .352 with eight home runs and 43 RBIs, placing him in the top three in all categories. On June 19, 2013, Ramirez opted out of his contract with the Rhinos, stating that he wanted to be closer to his family. Texas Rangers system (2013) Ramirez signed a minor league deal on July 3, 2013 with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to the Round Rock Express of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). After noticing a decrease in Ramirez' bat speed, which resulted in a lack of power, the Rangers released Ramirez on August 13. Chicago Cubs system (2014‚Äì2016) and coaching Ramirez signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs on May 25, 2014, to serve as a player-coach for the Iowa Cubs, Chicago's Class AAA affiliate in the PCL.Manny hired as Triple-A player-coach Ramirez hit a two-run home run in his first Iowa home game at Principal Park on June 30, 2014. Cubs prospects Arismendy Alc√°ntara and Javier B√°ez credited Ramirez for his help with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after the loss of his uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain about Ramirez plans for the next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball. On February 24, 2015, the Cubs announced that Ramirez was hired as a hitting consultant, and that he would split time between Chicago and AAA Iowa. In 2016, Ramirez was a hitting consultant for the Cubs.http://www.espn.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/37339/manny-ramirez-on- cubs-offense-this-year-is-going-to-be-way-better-than-last-year K≈çchi Fighting Dogs (2017) On January 8, 2017, the K≈çchi Fighting Dogs of the Japanese Shikoku Island League Plus independent league announced that they had reached an agreement with Ramirez to play for them in 2017. He left the team on August 17 to return to the United States for treatment of a knee injury. =(2018-present)= in April 2020, Ramirez expressed interest in returning to the Chinese Professional Baseball League but was not offered a contract by a team. He later expressed interest in playing winter baseball for the New Zealand-based Auckland Tuatara of the Australian Baseball League if the leagues season is not cancelled due to Covid-19.https://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/manny-ramirez-new-zealand- australian-baseball-league/560676 On August 29, 2020, Ramirez signed a one year deal with the Sydney Blue Sox to be a player-coach. Personal life On May 10, 2004, Ramirez missed a Red Sox game to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. He entered the next game running onto the field to a standing ovation while carrying a small American flag held in his hand. He planted the flag in the left outfield corner of the field, in the shadow of the Green Monster, where it remained for the entire game. Ramirez has three sons. Manny Ramirez, Jr. (born 1995) is his son from a previous relationship, while he had Manuelito \\"Manny\\" Ramirez (born 2003) and Lucas Ramirez (born February 2006) with his wife Juliana. , he and his family reside in Weston, Florida. As of May 2018, Manny Ramirez Jr. is a member of the New Britain Bees, a team in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Ramirez at Dodger Stadium on September 25, 2008, after the Dodgers clinched the NL West Division title Ramirez has often attracted attention on and off the field for his quirky and often fun-loving behavior and attitude, which is sometimes at odds with MLB's more serious and traditional culture. These incidents are colloquially known as \\"Manny Moments\\" or, more commonly, \\"Manny Being Manny\\". Instances of this behavior include inducing his Red Sox teammates, including Ellis Burks, to drink alcohol which he had spiked with Viagra, wearing Oakley THUMP while playing the outfield, disappearing through a door in the Green Monster to use the bathroom, diving to intercept a throw from teammate Johnny Damon in the outfield which had been intended for the infield, selling his barbecue grill on eBay, and high fiving a fan after a catch at the outfield wall before throwing the ball back to the infield to complete a double play. The first known documented usage of the phrase \\"Manny Being Manny\\" is attributed to then-Indians manager Mike Hargrove, quoted in a 1995 Newsday article. Ramirez also built a reputation, despite his quirky behavior, of being someone who was a tireless worker at his hitting. He was known for long batting practice and tee sessions as well as constantly reviewing video of his swings and of opposing pitchers. However, while in the batters box during games, he kept his approach extremely simple, relying on the muscle memory and pitch recognition from his training regimen. He was known, at times, to verbally simplify his approach in the batters box to merely \\"seeing the ball\\".

It is directed by Phil Roman and stars Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, as well as Thom Huge, Gregg Berger, Julie Payne, Pat Harrington Jr., David L. Lander and Pat Carroll. The special is about Garfield spending Christmas with the Arbuckle family on their farm, and discovering the true meaning of Christmas. Davis, who wrote the teleplay, cited it as semi-autobiographical. The special was first broadcast December 21, 1987, on CBS and was often rebroadcast in subsequent years at Christmastime: until 2000 (December 14, 2000 was the final CBS broadcast). It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and has been released on DVD. This was the seventh of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  In a dream, Garfield is awakened by his owner Jon dressed as an elf, who feeds him a large amount of lasagna before giving him his gift, a robotic Santa Claus which reads minds and produces whatever the user wants. When Jon actually wakes up Garfield, he tells him that it is \\"Christmas Eve morning\\" and they and Odie are going to the countryside to celebrate Christmas with Jon's family on their farm. Garfield is annoyed that they always go to the farm and the family never comes to Jon's house. During his drive to his family's farm, Jon talks about Christmases he had when he was a boy, with his parents, brother Doc Boy, and Grandma, while Garfield listens with great cynicism. Upon arriving, Grandma and Garfield quickly grow a special bond. While Jon, Garfield, and Odie take a walk, Grandma spikes Mom's sausage gravy with chili powder, bragging that her sausage gravy just won the Greene County Fair. Jon and Garfield return for dinner, while Odie works on something secretive and then sneaks back into the house. After dinner, they decorate the tree. Jon asks Garfield to put the star on, as no one else can reach the top of the tree. As the family sings Christmas songs, Grandma tells Garfield about her beloved and deceased husband, whom she especially misses at Christmastime because of his unspoken, but obvious, love for the holiday. Afterwards, Mom asks Dad to read a book called Binky: The Clown Who Saved Christmas. Dad is reluctant, as he is tired of reading it every year, but gives in. At night, Garfield notices Odie's suspicious activity and follows him to the barn, seeing Odie making something out of a piece of wood, some wire, a plunger handle, and a hand rake. While there, Garfield stumbles upon some old letters and realizes they must be 50 years old. On Christmas morning, just when it seems like all the presents have been opened, Garfield gives Grandma the letters he found in the barn. These letters were love notes written to Grandma by her husband from when they first met each other and married. Garfield also finds out that Odie has been busy making his ultimate Christmas gift: a homemade back scratcher. Garfield gladly thanks and embraces Odie for the gift he made. This is a rare glimpse at Garfield's other side, as Garfield learns one of the true meanings of Christmas: \\"It's not the giving, it's not the getting, it's the loving!\\"  Voice cast   Songs  Pat Carroll voiced Grandma. * \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" performed by Lou Rawls * \\"Can't Wait Till Christmas\\" performed by Thom Huge, Lorenzo Music, and Gregg Berger * \\"O Christmas Tree\\" performed by Pat Carroll * \\"Christmas in Your Heart\\" performed by ensemble and Desir√©e Goyette * \\"You Can Never Find an Elf When You Need One\\" performed by Lou Rawls and Desir√©e Goyette * \\"A Good Old-Fashioned Christmas\\" (ending song) performed by ensemble \\"Here Comes Garfield\\" from the special of the same name can be heard instrumentally when Jon wakes up Garfield from his dream.  Production  In writing the teleplay, Davis based it on experiences he had celebrating Christmas with his family on their farm in Indiana, with many Arbuckles modeled after Davis family members. Davis' real-life brother was known as Doc Boy. Davis referred to the story as \\"very autobiographical,\\" adding \\"That was my Christmas on the farm.\\" However, he noted Grandma was an entirely fictional character, added for the emotional subplot of having time with loved ones at Christmas. Lorenzo Music, Thom Huge and Gregg Berger reprise their respective roles from past films as Garfield, Jon Arbuckle, and Odie. Julie Payne and Pat Harrington Jr. voice Jon's mother and father, while David L. Lander voices Jon's brother, Doc Boy. Grandma was voiced by Pat Carroll, who at the time was becoming increasingly popular in voice work. After the 1970s, she was working on Legends of the Superheroes and Pound Puppies.  Broadcast and release  The episode first aired on December 21, 1987. According to Bustle, the special was rebroadcast every year until 2000. It often played along with the 1965 Peanuts special A Charlie Brown Christmas. In 2004, A Garfield Christmas was released on the DVD Garfield Holiday Celebrations, along with Garfield's Halloween Adventure and Garfield's Thanksgiving. It appeared 23rd in TV DVD sales for the week of November 10, 2007. In 2014, Entertainment Weekly reported copies of the DVD \\"were selling on eBay like rare collector's items.\\" Garfield holiday-themed specials, including A Garfield Christmas, were also receiving millions of views on the website YouTube. It was consequently re-released on another DVD compilation, The Garfield Holiday Collection, on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.  Reception  The special was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2004, TV Guide ranked the special 10th on its 10 Best Family Holiday Specials list. In 2013, Scott Neumyer of Parade called it \\"a delightful little short featuring everyone's favorite cantankerous orange cat.\\" That year, Jef Rouner of the Houston Press described the episode as \\"depressing\\" and mostly unfunny, remarking that since Grandma cannot hear Garfield's thoughts, \\"what we're watching is a sad old widow so desperately lonely without her late husband that she has begun talking out loud to a visiting cat.\\" In 2014, Johnny Brayson of Bustle called it \\"a bona fide classic\\".

Schistosoma mansoni is a water-borne parasite of humans, and belongs to the group of blood flukes (Schistosoma). The adult lives in the blood vessels (mesenteric veins) near the human intestine. It causes intestinal schistosomiasis (similar to S. japonicum, S. mekongi, S. guineensis, and S. intercalatum). Clinical symptoms are caused by the eggs. As the leading cause of schistosomiasis in the world, it is the most prevalent parasite in humans. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. As of 2016, 206.5 million people have schistosomiasis and S. mansoni is the major parasite. It is found in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname. Unlike other flukes (trematodes) in which sexes are not separate (monoecious), schistosomes are unique in that adults are divided into males and females, thus, (dioecious). However, the two adults live in permanent partnership, a condition called in copula; for this, they are considered as hermaphrodites. The life cycle of schistosomes includes two hosts: humans as definitive hosts, where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, and snails as intermediate hosts, where a series of asexual reproductive takes place. S. mansoni is transmitted through water, where freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria act as intermediate hosts. The larvae are able to live in water and infect the hosts by directly penetrating the skin. Prevention of infection is done by improved sanitation and killing the snails. Infection is treated with praziquantel. S. mansoni was first noted by Theodor Maximillian Bilharz in Egypt in 1851, while discovering S. haematobium. Sir Patrick Manson identified it as unique species in 1902. Louis Westenra Sambon gave the name Schistosomum mansoni in 1907 in honour of Manson. Structure =Adult= Schistosomes, unlike other trematodes, are long and cylindrical worms. The male S. mansoni is approximately 1 cm long (0.6‚Äì1.1 cm) and is 0.1 cm wide. It is white, and it has a funnel-shaped oral sucker at its anterior end followed by a second pediculated ventral sucker. The external part of the worm is composed of a double bilayer, which is continuously renewed as the outer layer, known as the membranocalyx, and is shed continuously. The tegument bears a large number of small tubercules. The suckers have small thorns in their inner part as well as in the buttons around them. The male genital apparatus is composed of 6 to 9 testicular masses, situated dorsally. There is one deferent canal beginning at each testicle, which is connected to a single deferent that dilates into a reservatory, the seminal vesicle, located at the beginning of the gynaecophoric canal. The copula happens through the coaptation of the male and female genital orifices. The female has a cylindrical body, longer and thinner than the male's (1.2 to 1.6 cm long by 0.016 cm wide). It has the general appearance of a roundworm. The female parasite is darker, and it looks gray. The darker color is due to the presence of a pigment (hemozoin) in its digestive tube. This pigment is derived from the digestion of blood. The ovary is elongated and slightly lobulated and is located on the anterior half of the body. A short oviduct conducts to the ootype, which continues with the uterine tube. In this tube it is possible to find 1 to 2 eggs (rarely 3 to 4) but only 1 egg is observed in the ootype at any one time. The genital pore opens ventrally. The posterior two-thirds of the body contain the vittelogenic glands and their winding canal, which unites with the oviduct a little before it reaches the ootype. The digestive tube begins at the anterior extremity of the worm, at the bottom of the oral sucker. The digestive tube is composed of an esophagus, which divides in two branches (right and left) and that reunite in a single cecum. The intestines end blindly, meaning that there is no anus. =Egg= The eggs are oval-shaped, measuring 115-175 ¬µm long and 45-47 ¬µm wide, and ~150 ¬µm diameter on average. They have pointed spines towards the broader base on one side, i.e. lateral spines. This is an important diagnostic tool because co- infection with S. haematobium (having a terminal-spined eggs) is common, and they are hard to distinguish. When the eggs are released into the water, a lot of them are immature and unfertilised so that they do not hatch. When the eggs are larger than 160 ¬µm in diameter, they also fail to hatch. =Larva= The miracidium (from the Greek word ŒºŒµŒπœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ, meirakion, meaning youth) is pear- shaped, and gradually elongates as it ages. It measures about 136 Œºm long and 55 Œºm wide. The body is covered by anucleate epidermal plates separated by epidermal ridges. The epidermal cells give off numerous hair-like cilia on the body surface. There are 17-22 epidermal cells. Epidermal plate is absent only at the extreme anterior called apical papilla, or terebratorium, which contains numerous sensory organelles. Its internal body is almost fully filled with glycogen particles and vesicles. The ceraria has a characteristic bifurcated tail, classically called furcae (Latin for fork); hence, the name (derived from a Greek word Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ, kerkos, meaning tail). The tail is highly flexible and its beating propels the ceracaria in water. It is about 0.2 mm long and 47 Œºm wide, somewhat loosely attached to the main body. The body is pear-shaped and measures 0.24 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. Its tegument is fully covered with spine. A conspicuous oral sucker is at the apex. As a non-feeding larva, there are no elaborate digestive organs, only oesophagus is distinct. There are three pairs of mucin glands connected to laterally to the oral sucker at the region of the ventral sucker.  Physiology  = Feeding and nutrition = Developing Schistosoma mansoni worms that have infected their definitive hosts, prior to the sexual pairing of males and females, require a nutrient source in order to properly develop from cercariae to adults. The developing parasites lyse host red blood cells to gain access to nutrients and also makes its own fungi from its waste it is hard to detect; the hemoglobin and amino acids the blood cells contain can be used by the worm to form proteins. While hemoglobin is digested intracellularly, initiated by salivary gland enzymes, iron waste products cannot be used by the worms, and are typically discarded via regurgitation. Kasschau et al. (1995) tested the effect of temperature and pH on the ability of developing S. mansoni to lyse red blood cells. The researchers found that the parasites were best able to destroy red blood cells for their nutrients at a pH of 5.1 and a temperature of 37 ¬∞C. = Locomotion = S. mansoni is locomotive in primarily two stages of its life cycle: as cercariae swimming freely through a body of freshwater to locate the epidermis of their human hosts, and as developing and fully- fledged adults, migrating throughout their primary host upon infection. Cercariae are attracted to the presence of fatty acids on the skin of their definitive host, and the parasite responds to changes in light and temperature in their freshwater medium to navigate towards the skin. Ressurreicao et al. (2015) tested the roles of various protein kinases in the ability of the parasite to navigate its medium and locate a penetrable host surface. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and protein kinase C both respond to changes in medium temperature and light levels, and the stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, associated with recognition of parasite host surface, results in a glandular secretion that deteriorates the host epidermis, and allows the parasite to burrow into its host. The parasite's nervous system contains bilobed ganglia and several nerve cords which splay out to every surface of the body; serotonin is a transmitter distributed widely throughout the nervous system and plays an important role in nervous reception, and stimulating mobility. Life cycle Life cycle of Schistosoma mansoni. =Intermediate host= After the eggs of the human-dwelling parasite are emitted in the faeces and into the water, the ripe miracidium hatches out of the egg. The hatching happens in response to temperature, light and dilution of faeces with water. The miracidium searches for a suitable freshwater snail belonging to the genus Biomphalaria. In South America, the principal intermediate host is Biomphalaria glabrata, while B. straminea and B. tenagophila are less common. A land snail Achatina fulica was reported in 2010 to act as a host in Venezuela. Libora M., Morales G., Carmen S., Isbelia S. & Luz A. P. (2010). \\"Primer hallazgo en Venezuela de huevos de Schistosoma mansoni y de otros helmintos de inter√©s en salud p√∫blica, presentes en heces y secreci√≥n mucosa del molusco terrestre Achatina fulica (Bowdich, 1822). [First finding in Venezuela of Schistosoma mansoni eggs and other helminths of interest in public health found in faeces and mucous secretion of the mollusc Achatina fulica (Bowdich, 1822)]. Zootecnia Tropical 28: 383-394. PDF. In Africa, B. glabratra, B. pfeifferi, B. choanomphala and B. sudanica act as the hosts; but in Egypt, the main snail host is B. alexandrina. Miracidia directly penetrate the soft tissue of snail. Inside the snail, they lose their cilia and develop into mother sporocysts. The sporocysts rapidly multiply by asexual reproduction, each forming numerous daughter sporocysts. The daughter sporocysts move to the liver and gonads of the snail, where they undergo further growth. Within 2‚Äì4 weeks, they undergo metamorphosis and give rise to fork-tailed cercariae. Stimulated by light, hundreds of cercariae penetrate out of the snail into water. =Definitive host= The cercaria emerge from the snail during daylight and they propel themselves in water with the aid of their bifurcated tail, actively seeking out their final host. In water, they can live for up to 12 hours, and their maximum infectivity is between 1 and 9 hours after emergence. When they recognise human skin, they penetrate it within a very short time. This occurs in three stages, an initial attachment to the skin, followed by the creeping over the skin searching for a suitable penetration site, often a hair follicle, and finally penetration of the skin into the epidermis using cytolytic secretions from the cercarial post- acetabular, then pre-acetabular glands. On penetration, the head of the cercaria transforms into an endoparasitic larva, the schistosomule. Each schistosomule spends a few days in the skin and then enters the circulation starting at the dermal lymphatics and venules. Here, they feed on blood, regurgitating the haem as hemozoin. The schistosomule migrates to the lungs (5‚Äì7 days post-penetration) and then moves via circulation through the left side of the heart to the hepatoportal circulation (>15 days) where, if it meets a partner of the opposite sex, it develops into a sexually mature adult and the pair migrate to the mesenteric veins. Such pairings are monogamous. Male schistosomes undergo normal maturation and morphological development in the presence or absence of a female, although behavioural, physiological and antigenic differences between males from single-sex, as opposed to bisex, infections have been reported. On the other hand, female schistosomes do not mature without a male. Female schistosomes from single-sex infections are underdeveloped and exhibit an immature reproductive system. Although the maturation of the female worm seems to be dependent on the presence of the mature male, the stimuli for female growth and for reproductive development seem to be independent from each other. The adult female worm resides within the adult male worm's gynaecophoric canal, which is a modification of the ventral surface of the male, forming a groove. The paired worms move against the flow of blood to their final niche in the mesenteric circulation, where they begin egg production (>32 days). The S. mansoni parasites are found predominantly in the small inferior mesenteric blood vessels surrounding the large intestine and caecal region of the host. Each female lays approximately 300 eggs a day (one egg every 4.8 minutes), which are deposited on the endothelial lining of the venous capillary walls. Most of the body mass of female schistosomes is devoted to the reproductive system. The female converts the equivalent of almost her own body dry weight into eggs each day. The eggs move into the lumen of the host's intestines and are released into the environment with the faeces. Genome Schistosoma mansoni has 8 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 16)‚Äî7 autosomal pairs and 1 sex pair. The female schistosome is heterogametic, or ZW, and the male is homogametic, or ZZ. Sex is determined in the zygote by a chromosomal mechanism. The genome is approximately 270 MB with a GC content of 34%, 4‚Äì8% highly repetitive sequence, 32‚Äì36% middle repetitive sequence and 60% single copy sequence. Numerous highly or moderately repetitive elements are identified, with at least 30% repetitive DNA. Chromosomes range in size from 18 to 73 MB and can be distinguished by size, shape, and C banding. In 2000, the first BAC library of Schistosome was constructed. In June 2003, a ~5x whole genome shotgun sequencing project was initiated at the Sanger Institute. Also in 2003, 163,000 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) were generated (by a consortium headed by the University of S√£o Paulo) from six selected developmental stages of this parasite, resulting in 31,000 assembled sequences and an estimated 92% of the 14,000-gene complement. In 2009 the genomes of both S. mansoni and S. japonicum were published, with each describing 11,809 and 13,469 genes, respectively. S. mansoni genome has increased protease families and deficiencies in lipid anabolism; which are attributed its parasitic adaptation. Portease included the invadolysin (host penetration) and cathepsin (blood-feeding) gene families. In 2012, an improved version of the S. mansoni genome was published, which consisted of only 885 scaffolds and more than 81% of the bases organised into chromosomes. Pathology A Schistosoma mansoni egg with the characteristic lateral spine Schistosome eggs, which may become lodged within the hosts tissues, are the major cause of pathology in schistosomiasis. Some of the deposited eggs reach the outside environment by passing through the wall of the intestine; the rest are swept into the circulation and are filtered out in the periportal tracts of the liver, resulting in periportal fibrosis. Onset of egg laying in humans is sometimes associated with an onset of fever (Katayama fever). This \\"acute schistosomiasis\\" is not, however, as important as the chronic forms of the disease. For S. mansoni and S. japonicum, these are \\"intestinal\\" and \\"hepatic schistosomiasis\\", associated with formation of granulomas around trapped eggs lodged in the intestinal wall or in the liver, respectively. The hepatic form of the disease is the most important, granulomas here giving rise to fibrosis of the liver and hepatosplenomegaly in severe cases. Symptoms and signs depend on the number and location of eggs trapped in the tissues. Initially, the inflammatory reaction is readily reversible. In the latter stages of the disease, the pathology is associated with collagen deposition and fibrosis, resulting in organ damage that may be only partially reversible. Granuloma formation is initiated by antigens secreted by the miracidium through microscopic pores within the rigid egg shell, and the immune response to granuloma, rather than the direct action of egg antigens, causes the symptoms. The granulomas formed around the eggs impair blood flow in the liver and, as a consequence, induce portal hypertension. With time, collateral circulation is formed and the eggs disseminate into the lungs, where they cause more granulomas, pulmonary arteritis and, later, cor pulmonale. A contributory factor to portal hypertension is Symmers' fibrosis, which develops around branches of the portal veins. This fibrosis occurs only many years after the infection and is presumed to be caused in part by soluble egg antigens and various immune cells that react to them. Recent research has shown that granuloma size is consistent with levels of IL-13, which plays a prominent role in granuloma formation and granuloma size. IL-13 receptor Œ± 2 (IL-13RŒ±2) binds IL-13 with high affinity and blocks the effects of IL-13. Thus, this receptor is essential in preventing the progression of schistosomiasis from the acute to the chronic (and deadly) stage of disease. Synthetic IL-13RŒ±2 given to mice has resulted in significant decreases in granuloma size, implicating IL-13RŒ±2 as an important target in schistosomiasis. S. mansoni infection often occurs alongside those of viral hepatitis, either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). This is due to high prevalence of schistosomiasis in areas where chronic viral hepatitis is prevalent. One important factor was the development of large reservoir of infection due to extensive schistosomiasis control programs that used intravenously administered tartar emetic since the 1960s. Co-infection is known to cause earlier liver deterioration and more severe illness. = Evasion of host immunity = Adult and larval worms migrate through the host's blood circulation avoiding the host's immune system. The worms have many tools that help in this evasion, including the tegument, antioxidant proteins, and defenses against host membrane attack complex (MAC). The tegument coats the worm and acts as a physical barrier to host antibodies and complement. Host immune defenses are capable of producing superoxide, but these are counterattacked by antioxidant proteins produced by the parasite. Schistosomes have four superoxide dismutases, and levels of these proteins increase as the schistosome grows. Antioxidant pathways were first recognised as a chokepoints for schistosomes, and later extended to other trematodes and cestodes. Targeting of this pathway with different inhibitors of the central antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) results in reduced viability of worms. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) protein is present on the parasite tegument and protects host cells by blocking formation of MAC. In addition, schistosomes have six homologues of human CD59 which are strong inhibitors of MAC. =Diagnosis= The presence of S. mansoni is detected by microscopic examination of parasite eggs in stool. A staining method called Kato-Katz technique is used for stool examination. It involves methylene blue-stained cellophane soaked in glycerine or glass slides. A bit costlier technique called formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT) is often used in combination with the direct faecal smear for higher accuracy. Serological and immunological tests are also available. Antibodies and antigens can be detected in the blood using ELISA to identify infection. Adult worm antigens can be detected by indirect haemagglutination assays (IHAs). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also used for detecting the parasite DNA. Circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine can be tested with lateral flow immune- chromatographic reagent strip and point-of-care (POC) tests. Egg detection and immunologic tests are not that sensitive. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based testing is accurate and rapid. They, however, are not frequency used in countries were the disease is common due to the cost of the equipment and the technical experience required to run them. Using a microscope to detect eggs costs about US$0.40 per test well PCR is about $US7 per test as of 2019. Loop- mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are being studied as they are lower cost. LAMP testing is not commercially available as of 2019. =Treatment= The standard drug for S. mansoni infection is praziquantel at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Oxamniquine is also used. Epidemiology As of WHO report in 2016, 206.5 million people worldwide are having schistosomiasis due to different species of Schistosoma. More than 88 million people were given medical treatment. S. mansoni is the major species. It is endemic in 55 countries and most prevalent in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname. About 80-85% of schistosomiasis is found in sub-Saharan Africa, where S. haematobium, S. intercalatum and S. mansoni are endemic. Approximately 393 million Africans are at risk of infection from S. mansoni, of which about 55 million are infected at any moment. Annual death due to S. mansoni is about 130,000. The prevalence rate in different countries of Africa are: 73.9% in northern Ethiopia, 37.9% in western Ethiopia, 56% in Nigeria, 60.5% in Kenya, 64.3% in Tanzania, 19.8% in Ghana, and 53.8% in C√¥te d'Ivoire. In Egypt, 60% of the population in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Nile Delta and only 6% in the Southern part are infected. S. mansoni is commonly found in places with poor sanitation. Because of the parasite's fecal-oral transmission, bodies of water that contain human waste can be infectious. Water that contains large populations of the intermediate host snail species is more likely to cause infection. Young children living in these areas are at greatest risk because of their tendency to swim and bathe in cercaria-infected waters longer than adults . Anyone travelling to the areas described above, and who is exposed to contaminated water, is at risk of schistosomiasis. History The intermediate hosts Biomphalaria snails are estimated to originate in South America 95-110 million years ago. But the parasites Schistosoma originated in Asia. In Africa, the progenitor species evolved into modern S. mansoni and S. haematobium around 2-5 million years ago. It reached Egypt via infected slaves and baboons from the Land of Punt through migrations that occurred possibly as early as the V Dynasty (c. 2494‚Äì2345 BCE). A German physician Theodor Maximillian Bilharz was the first to discover the parasite in 1851, while working at Kasr el-Aini Hospital, a medical school in Cairo. Bilharz recovered them from autopsies of dead soldiers, and noticed two distinct parasites. He described one of them as Distomum haematobium (now S. haematobium) in 1852, but failed to identify the other. In one of his letters to his mentor Karl Theordor von Siebold, he mentioned some of the eggs were different in having terminal spines while some had lateral spines. Terminal- spined eggs are unique to S. haematobium, while lateral spines are found only in S. mansoni. Bilharz also noted that the adult flukes were different in anatomy and number eggs they produced. He introduced the terms bilharzia and bilharziasis for the name of the infection in 1856. A German zoologist David Friedrich Weinland corrected the genus name to Schistosoma in 1858; and introduced the disease name as schistosomiasis. The species distinction was first recognised by Patrick Manson at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Manson identified lateral-spined eggs in the faeces of a colonial officer earlier posted to the West Indies, and concluded that there were two species of Schistosoma. An Italian-British physician Louis Westenra Sambon gave the new names Schistosomum haematobium and Schistosomum mansoni in 1907, the latter to honour Manson. Sambon only gave partial description using a male worm. In 1908, a Brazilian physician Manuel Augusto Piraj√° da Silva gave a complete description of male and female worms, including the lateral-spined eggs. Piraj√° da Silva obtained specimens from three necropsies and eggs from 20 stool examinations in Bahia. He gave the name S. americanum. The species identity was confirmed in 1907 by British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper, identifying the specific snail host, and distinguishing the egg structure, thereby establishing the life cycle.

Biography  = Early life = Laughlin was born into a middle-class family in Lake Charles, Louisiana. His rocky childhood, southern heritage, and interest in literature influenced his work greatly. After losing everything in a failed rice-growing venture in 1910, his family was forced to relocate to New Orleans where Laughlin's father found work in a factory. Laughlin was an introverted child with few friends and a close relationship with his father, who cultivated and encouraged his lifelong love of literature and whose death in 1918 devastated his son. Although he dropped out of high school in 1920 after having barely completed his first year, Laughlin was an educated and highly literate man. His large vocabulary and love of language are evident in the elaborate captions he later wrote to accompany his photographs. He initially aspired to be a writer and wrote many poems and stories in the style of French symbolism, most of which remained unpublished. = Photography career = Laughlin discovered photography when he was 25 and taught himself how to use a simple 2¬Ω by 2¬º view camera. He began working as a freelance architectural photographer and was subsequently employed by agencies as varied as Vogue Magazine and the US government. Disliking the constraints of government work, Laughlin eventually left Vogue after a conflict with then-editor Edward Steichen. Thereafter, he worked almost exclusively on personal projects utilizing a wide range of photographic styles and techniques, from simple geometric abstractions of architectural features to elaborately staged allegories utilizing models, costumes, and props. Through this period one of his favorite models was Dody Weston Thompson who went on to become a notable photographer in her own right. Laughlin‚Äôs personal projects and large collection of images focused mostly on places and the architecture located there. His most well known works focus on New Orleans, but he also photographed in Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, San Antonio, and Little Rock. With the photobook being the ultimate goal and measure for success for photographers, Laughlin achieved this in 1948 when Ghosts Along the Mississippi: The Magic of the Old Houses of Louisiana was first published. The book features 100 black and white images of photographs that are focused around the architecture of the south during the plantation era. Through this book, Laughlin was interested in representing the lengthy history of Louisiana and the feeling of life there, while also recognizing the history of slavery as well as the imaginary situations that he created. = Death = He died on 2 January 1985 in New Orleans, leaving behind a massive collection of books and images. Thanks to the 17,000 negatives that he preserved, his work continues to be shown around the United States and Europe. Laughlin's library, comprising over 30,000 volumes, was purchased by Louisiana State University in 1986. The collection's focus in on science fiction, fantasy, mystery and the macabre. Other subjects represented include 20th-century art and design, European and American architecture, photography, Victoriana, humor, sex and sexuality, psychology, spiritualism, and the occult.LSU Libraries Special Collections website. Laughlin is buried in Paris's P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in grave 18223.  Legacy  Many historians credit Laughlin as being the first true surrealist photographer in the United States. His images are often nostalgic, reflecting the influence of Eug√®ne Atget and other photographers who tried to capture vanishing urban landscapes. A pair of surrealistic photographs of parts on a 1939 Ford, in which the photographer's reflection as he took the pictures could be seen, were showcased in 2013 on an episode of Antiques Roadshow set in Baton Rouge, LA, and attributed to Clarence John Laughlin.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/season/18/baton-rouge- la/appraisals/clarence-john-laughlin-photos-ca-1938--201306A45/ The man who brought the photographs to the Roadshow knew Laughlin's son, and saw the photos hanging at the son's place of business. In order to acquire them, the man traded automobile repairs and various parts, first for one, then for the other. Their retail value, as a pair, was appraised at $7,000 to $9,000, although the owner indicated that he thought they were priceless.

The Newport sex scandal arose from a 1919 investigation by the United States Navy into homosexual acts by Navy personnel and civilians in Newport, Rhode Island. The investigation was noted for its controversial methods of intelligence gathering, specifically its use of enlisted personnel to investigate alleged homosexuals by engaging them sexually. A subsequent trial attracted national news coverage and provoked a congressional investigation, which concluded with Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future United States president) Franklin D. Roosevelt being formally rebuked by a Congressional committee. History =Background and investigation= In February 1919, sailor Thomas Brunelle and chief machinist's mate Ervin Arnold were patients at the naval hospital at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. Brunelle disclosed to Arnold that both naval and civilian men who have sex with men regularly met at the Army and Navy YMCA and the Newport Art Club for companionship and sex. Arnold independently investigated Brunelle's claims, discovering parties involving cross-dressing, same-sex sexual activity, and liquor and cocaine use at the locations. Arnold presented his Navy superiors with a detailed report of his findings. Admiral Spencer S. Wood, commander of the 2nd Naval District, ordered an investigation and created a court of inquiry to review Arnold‚Äôs claims. On March 19, 1919, the court concluded that a thorough investigation was warranted. Then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the court's recommendation, and asked Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to undertake the investigation. Palmer assigned Arnold, a former Connecticut state detective, to lead the investigation. With an infiltration approach in mind, he chose his investigators on the basis of their youth and looks. Over a period of several weeks, 13 such agents submitted daily reports to Arnold that included candid descriptions of homosexual acts and their participation in them. They rarely reported any hesitancy or qualms about their direct participation. =Arrests and trial= Arrests began on April 4, and by April 22, fifteen sailors had been arrested. Each was brought before a military tribunal and heard men whom they recognized as former sexual partners provide graphic testimony of their encounters. Older naval officers were confounded by the terms used by the investigators. Once the operatives had presented their evidence before the court, the accused were encouraged to incriminate others and many did so, in hopes of leniency. Brunelle incriminated some but withheld the names of his closest friends. The three- week military trial ended with the court-martial of 17 sailors charged with sodomy and \\"scandalous conduct.\\" Most were sent to the naval prison at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. Two more were dishonorably discharged and two others were found innocent with no further action. =Media coverage and political fallout= The Providence Journal, under publisher John R. Rathom, covered the trial proceedings daily, often with a critical eye toward the prosecution's case. On January 8, 1920, Rev. Samuel Neal Kent, an Episcopal clergyman, was found not guilty on all charges. In his charge to the jury in that case, the judge was at pains to discredit the witnesses who described their participation in illicit sexual acts. He reasoned that since no military or governmental authority could legitimately order them to participate in such acts against their will, either they were willing participants, whose complaints were groundless, or they were acting under the compulsion of unlawful commands, on the part of their superiors. His analysis fueled opposition in Newport's religious community. Within days, a committee of Newport clergymen drafted a lengthy letter to President Woodrow Wilson denouncing the Navy's activities in Newport, specifically the \\"deleterious and vicious methods\\" used, including keeping those charged confined for months without trial. Among the signatories were Rev. William Safford Jones of Channing Church, Rev. J. Howard Deming, Rev. Everett P. Smith of St. Mary's Church, Portsmouth, and Rev. Richard Arnold Greene of Newport. The Providence Journal published the letter, which put the Navy on the defensive and named Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Roosevelt. Assistant Secretary Roosevelt angrily charged that press coverage like Rathom's would damage the Navy's reputation to the point that parents would not allow their sons to enlist. Also at issue, however, were the methods employed in the investigation. Rathom and Roosevelt had a \\"tart exchange of telegrams\\" disputing whether anyone in the naval hierarchy in Washington had supervised the investigation closely or authorized the actual participation of investigators in illicit acts... While investigations dragged, Roosevelt resigned from his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in July 1920 when he accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for vice president. He and presidential candidate James M. Cox were on the losing end of Warren G. Harding's landslide victory that year. On July 19, 1921, a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs denounced both Daniels and Roosevelt for the methods used in the Newport investigations. The New York Times reported that most of the details of the affair were \\"of an unprintable nature\\" but explained that the committee believed that Daniels and Roosevelt knew that \\"enlisted men of the navy were used as participants in immoral practices for the purpose of obtaining evidence.\\" The committee report declared that using enlisted men in this way \\"violated the code of the American citizen and ignored the rights of every American boy who enlisted in the navy to fight for his country.\\" The committee report also made public the earlier determination of a naval court-martial. To the court-martial's assessment that Roosevelt's behavior was \\"unfortunate and ill-advised,\\" the committee added \\"reprehensible.\\" Daniels's rejection of the court's judgment, the committee declared, \\"is to be severely condemned.\\".. Given how difficult all concerned found to discuss the details of the crimes at issue, their language characterizes the questionable activities repeatedly without ever specifying the actions themselves. They refer to a \\"lack of moral perspective\\" and invoked the youth of the navy personnel: \\"Conduct of a character at which seasoned veterans of the service would have shuddered was practically forced upon boys.\\" Their most explicit description said that the navy personnel allowed \\"to be performed upon them immoral acts.\\" Also, the committee wrote that for Daniels and Roosevelt to allow personnel to be placed in a position in which the acts were even liable to occur, was \\"a deplorable, disgraceful, and most unnatural proceeding.\\" Finally, the committee acknowledged that naval officials were facing a serious problem in Newport, and it denounced \\"immoral conditions\\" that were \\"a menace to both the health and the morale of the men in the naval training station.\\" =Aftermath= Roosevelt rejected the report, noting that the subcommittee's two Republican members had condemned him while the one Democrat issued a minority report. He contested many details and interpretations in the committee's report, and then went on the attack: \\"This business of using the navy as a football of politics has got to stop.\\" He had nothing to say about the court-martial's assessment.

History The magazine was started in 2000 by two 19-year-old sophomores, Tyler Monroe and Kelso Barnett. Overview The magazine's mission is to promote conservative politics and opinion at the University. The magazine prints eight issues a year and is distributed on the Berkeley campus free of charge. When a new issue is released, the Patriot homepage provides a link to a pdf version for reading. The Patriot also provides subscription options for those that would like it shipped to them. The magazine receives most of its funding from individuals and conservative foundations around the country. Notable stories In 2002, the California Patriot broke a story that the University of California, Berkeley, planned to host a 9/11 memorial event without any red- white-and-blue ribbons or other displays of American patriotism because they might offend foreign students. Bill O'Reilly hosted the editor of the California Patriot to tell the story on Fox News. The publicity caused the administration to reverse that decision. During the early 2000s, the magazine promoted support for President Bush and the Iraq War. Other stories have involved alleged misappropriation of money by an organ of the student government, and the use by the University of student funds to campaign against a California ballot proposition.

It cost about ¬£3.5 million to build and contained some of the most modern features in British civil architecture, including full air-conditioning. By the 21st century, it was regarded by some as outdated and unfashionable; the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)'s president, George Ferguson, called Tollgate House one of the ugliest buildings in Britain. In 2003, the site was compulsory purchased for redevelopment by Bristol City Council. In December 2005, the council announced that Tollgate House would be demolished as part of a ¬£500 million revamp of the Broadmead retail area. It was replaced by the car-park for the Cabot Circus retail development. The building could not be demolished by explosives owing to nearby properties, so was dismantled floor by floor. The work took several months to complete and was finished by May 2006, at a total cost of ¬£3.5 million (the same amount to construct it in the first place). The development received a BREEAM rating of \\"excellent\\", in part for recycling 90% of the waste generated during demolition on the site. The project was part of a greater redevelopment of Bristol city centre.

William Dudley Chipley (June 6, 1840 ‚Äì December 1, 1897) was an American railroad executive and politician who was instrumental in the building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad and was a tireless promoter of Pensacola, his adopted city, where he was elected to one term as mayor, and later to a term as Florida state senator. Following the American Civil War, in 1868 Chipley was one of twenty men arrested in his hometown of Columbus, Georgia, in 1868 on suspicion of participation in the murder of Radical Republican judge George W. Ashburn by the Ku Klux Klan. Political maneuvers resulted in the dropping of all charges. In 1877, Chipley helped Texas Rangers and Florida law officers subdue and arrest outlaw John Wesley Hardin aboard a train in Pensacola. Hardin was subsequently returned to Texas, convicted on outstanding murder charges, and imprisoned. Early life Chipley was born in Columbus, Georgia, the son of Dr. William Stout Chipley and Elizabeth Fannin Chipley. Chipley's grandfather, the Rev. Stephen Chipley, was one of the founding citizens of Lexington, Kentucky. Dr. Chipley was renowned for his work relating to brain diseases and held two jobs: a professor of medicine at Transylvania University and the warden of the Eastern Asylum for the Insane in Lexington. Chipley moved with his parents back to Lexington when he was four years old, and was raised for all of his formative years in Kentucky. He graduated from the Kentucky Military Institute and Transylvania University. Military service The base of the obelisk, with his biography inscribed. After graduation from Transylvania, he enlisted in the 9th Kentucky Infantry, fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He was elevated to the position of lieutenant colonel and was wounded at the battles of Shiloh and Chickamauga before being taken prisoner at the Battle of Peachtree Creek near Atlanta. As a prisoner of war, Chipley was transported to Johnson's Island on Lake Erie in Ohio, and was interned there until the war was over. In mid-1865, he settled in Columbus and married Ann Elizabeth Billups, the daughter of a prominent planter in Phenix City, Alabama, just across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus. Contemporary illustration of George W. Ashburn's murder Ashburn murder trial Chipley was later implicated and charged in the murder of George W. Ashburn by the Columbus Ku Klux Klan. Ashburn, a Radical Republican member of the Georgia government, was murdered on March 31, 1868, following warnings by the KKK to cease his outspoken support for Reconstruction. In the resultant investigation into his murder, Chipley was identified by witness Amanda Patterson as one of several men who broke into the house Ashburn was staying in; Patterson also told investigators that Chipley had, prior to the murder, told her \\"We are going to kill old Ashburn the night of the day he speaks [at a political meeting].\\" With former Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens representing the defense, Chipley and his alleged co- conspirators were tried before a military court (a civil court not being used as a result of Georgia's temporary military governorship). The prosecution, aided by federal investigator Hiram C. Whitley, assembled evidence of guilt to the point that sympathetic Southern newspapers switched from outright denial of Klan guilt to diminishing the status of the crime; as the Macon Weekly Telegraph hypothesized, perhaps the defendants had intended only to tar and feather Ashburn but when he resisted, the Klan members shot him in \\"quasi self-defense.\\" Northern newspapers reported the defense as resorting to tedious details in their attempt to clear the accused, with the Chicago Tribune recording the military judges as \\"growing somewhat weary of the great mass of trifling and irrelevant matter introduced by the defense.\\" Political intrigue, however, would ultimately undermine the case against Chipley and the other defendants. Stephens' connections with Democratic members of the Georgia House of Representatives lead to Democrats voting to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, a Republican goal, which in turn caused the re-admittance of Georgia to the Union and the invalidation of the military court proceedings. As a result, Chipley and the others charged in Ashburn's death were released. Railroad executive Monument in the town of Chipley, Florida Chipley entered the railroad industry shortly after the Ashburn trial. He worked for the Columbus and Rome Railroad, and later for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1873 to 1876. It was at this time that he moved to Pensacola, Florida, where he was made general manager of the Pensacola Railroad, a 45-mile line linking Pensacola with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, its parent company from 1880 onward. Chipley was also instrumental in the promoting and building of L&N; subsidiary Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad in 1881-1883, linking Pensacola and the Florida Panhandle with the eastern part of the state for the first time. Chipley was made vice-president of the P&A.; Chipley's success in getting a railroad built through the Panhandle led the residents of Orange, Florida, to rename their town Chipley in 1882. In the same year, the town of Chipley, Georgia, near Columbus, was named for him, after he got the tracks of the Columbus and Rome Railroad extended to that community; the town's name was changed to Pine Mountain in 1958. Politics and death The inscription on Chipley's obelisk in Pensacola commemorates him as a \\"soldier\\", \\"statesman\\" and \\"public benefactor\\". Chipley created the Democratic Executive Committee in Muscogee County, Georgia in the late 1860s, and was its first director. He later served as director of the Florida Democratic Executive Committee. Chipley served one term as the mayor of Pensacola (1887‚Äì1888). He also served in the Florida State Senate from 1895 to 1897, and lost his bid for United States Senator in 1896 by one vote. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., Chipley died on December 1, 1897. He was in the middle of a trip to lobby lawmakers to base more industrial endeavors in Florida. He was buried in Columbus, while the townspeople of Pensacola erected an obelisk in the Plaza Ferdinand VII in his honor.

Description Number 139 is constructed of hundreds of wooden slabs, chunks, wedges, blocks and twigs. Some of the wooden elements, if not all, are attached to one another with screws. The chunks and twigs are most evident at the top and sides of the structure. The majority of stacked slabs sit at eye level and downward, implying an impending collapse of the foundation. The natural surface of the wooden pieces and screws have been altered with black paint. Upon closer look, some of the wooden elements reveal their original caramel-toned pigment. The placement of each component is very deliberate. The composition of the work reads balanced and harmonious than that of natural destruction. Deep inside of the work, surprising elements appear such as toothy slabs. These thin pieces have split in some sort of methodical yet haphazard manner, revealing potential visual representations of teeth, piano keys, or city skylines. Repetition is routinely employed in the placement of materials except for two notable instances. Close to the bottom left of the artwork there is a misshapen slab with a nearly perfect circle-shaped cutaway. Upon close investigation, this negative circle space appears imperfect, implying possible organic origins. The circle detail is unique to the piece. The other notable eccentricity is a long stick at the top right portion of the work. It protrudes far more than any other element, almost disquietingly so in its exaggerated gesture. Many juxtapositions exist within this form, perhaps most prominently the twigs and stumps placed methodically against stacked machine-cut wooden slabs.

Biography Three pence note, printed by John Dunlap, Philadelphia, 1777 Dunlap was born in Strabane , County Tyrone, Ireland in 1747. When he was ten years old, he went to work as an apprentice to his uncle, William Dunlap, a printer and bookseller in Philadelphia. In 1766, William Dunlap left the business in the care of his nephew. John eventually bought the business, and at first made a living by printing sermons and probably broadsides and handbills too. In November 1771, Dunlap began the publication of the Pennsylvania Packet, or General Advertiser, a weekly newspaper. In 1773 he married Elizabeth Hayes Ellison. During the American Revolutionary War, Dunlap became an officer in the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry, and saw action with George Washington at the battles of Trenton and Princeton. He continued in the First City Troop after the war, rising to the rank of major, and leading Pennsylvania's cavalry militia to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. In 1776, Dunlap secured a lucrative printing contract for the Continental Congress. In July 1776, fighting between the American colonists and the British forces had been going on for over a year. On 2 July, the Second Continental Congress voted on the Lee Resolution to secede. Two days later, they approved the final wording of a public declaration regarding their decision, which we today call the Declaration of Independence. President of Congress John Hancock signed the fair copy with Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson attesting it. That evening Hancock ordered Dunlap to print broadside copies of the declaration. Dunlap printed perhaps 200 broadsides, since known as the Dunlap broadsides, which were the first published versions of the Declaration. Dunlap also printed items for Pennsylvania's revolutionary government. In 1777 he took over the printing of the Journals of the Continental Congress from Robert Aitken, but lost the contract in 1779 after printing in his newspaper a letter from Thomas Paine that leaked news of the secret French aid to the Americans. In 1784, Dunlap's paper became a daily with a new title: the North American and United States Gazette. It was not the first daily in the United States‚Äîthe Pennsylvania Evening Post was the first in 1783‚Äîbut it became the first successful daily. Continuing to serve the changing needs of the government, Dunlap and his partner David Claypoole printed the Constitution of the United States 19 September 1787 for use by the Constitutional Convention, and later published it for the first time in The Pennsylvania Packet.https://constitutioncenter.org/experience/exhibitions/main- exhibition/public-printing-of-the- constitutionhttps://www.loc.gov/collections/continental-congress-and- constitutional-convention-from-1774-to-1789/articles-and-essays/to-form-a- more-perfect-union/john-dunlap/ Dunlap's major financial success came from real estate speculation. During the American Revolution, he bought property confiscated from Loyalists who refused to take Pennsylvania's new loyalty oath. After the war, he bought land in Kentucky. By 1795, when he was forty- eight, he was able to retire with a sizable estate. Retirement did not agree with him, however; according to his friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, Dunlap became a drunkard in his final years. He died in Philadelphia.

The film stars Val Kilmer, Gabriel Byrne, Vinnie Jones, Patrick Bergin, Joanne Whalley, Bruno Kirby (in his final film), Anthony LaPaglia, Roy Dotrice, Patsy Kensit, Andy Nyman and Mick Rossi. Originally intended to be a short, the film was shot without the use of a scripted screenplay and the director (Sean Stanek) allowed the actors to improvise a majority of dialogue as he shot the scenes. The picture was shot on location in London and Los Angeles and took three years to complete. Plot The story opens in Los Angeles with Dillon (Val Kilmer) who receives a phone call from Ray Burns (Mick Rossi) who has just been shot and desperately needs help. Dillon is a cleaner for a gangster named Eddie (Gabriel Byrne) and has been sent to assist Ray should he require it. After a colorful opening title sequence which follows Dillon's drive to the house, he finds Ray almost bleeding to death on a sofa. Removing all of the evidence, Dillon leaves carrying Ray to his car but not before he torches the house, destroying any evidence of Ray's presence. As Dillon and Ray drive away, Dillon struggles to keep Ray conscious and relates to him a story of a humorous encounter with a Mexican auto mechanic, which coins one of the catchphrases of the film: \\"I'm not gonna taco\\". The story then flashes back to eight years earlier and introduces Riley (Patrick Bergin) as he admires some artwork in a London gallery. He receives a call on his cell phone from the crooked Detective Brice (Vinnie Jones), who informs Riley that there is a shipment of heroin coming in, and that he wants Riley to get a team together and steal it for him. Riley agrees to the job and tells Brice that he has just the man to do it, a petty thief named Ray Burns. Riley gives a menacing stare to the gallery attendant (Caspar von Winterfeldt) in one of the films funnier moments before leaving to meet with Ray. After they discuss the details of the job at hand, Ray agrees to do the job and meets up with his team, which consists of Nathan (Sean Power) and Terry Rawlings (Trevor Nugent) son of infamous moblord Jack Rawlings (Roy Dotrice) and Terry's girlfriend, Cindy (Patsy Kensit). Together they begin plotting the heist: Nathan will go up to the roof and act as lookout while Ray and Terry break into the warehouse to steal the heroin. Unfortunately, during the heist, Nathan loses his footing and tumbles to his death, falling through a skylight and triggering an alarm, alerting the guards. Ray and Terry manage to escape with the drugs, but lose contact with each other. Shortly thereafter, Brice calls Riley to inform him that the heist went terribly wrong, and that Nathan is dead. To cover his own tracks, he tells Riley to find a scapegoat, and Riley immediately names Ray. Meanwhile, Ray, who has gone into hiding, tries to call Terry but doesn't get an answer. He turns to Riley to find out what happened. Riley tells Ray that Nathan is dead and that Scotland Yard is looking for him, omitting the fact that Terry has handed over the drugs and that Brice is behind the whole heist. Ray decides he needs to disappear for a while and attempts to go underground, but before he can do so the police pick him up on an anonymous tip from Brice. Ray is convicted for the robbery and the manslaughter of Nathan, and is subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison. Ray serves his time, but has no contact with the outside world, denying even his closest lover and girlfriend Maggie (Joanne Whalley) a visit. He also learns by reading the paper that Terry has died of a drug overdose. Saddened by the news, Ray vows to get revenge on Brice and Riley as soon as he is free. While Ray is serving time, Riley and Brice continue their crooked ways, and Brice informs Riley that he has an incriminating video tape of London Charlie (Steve Jones) that could be worth some cash. He dispatches Riley to Los Angeles to blackmail London Charlie. Riley arrives in Los Angeles along with his girlfriend Samantha Fay (Sile Bermingham) in order to pick up the cash from Brice. Meanwhile, Ray is released from prison and contacted by London Charlie, who realizes that the only way he can escape his dilemma is to have Riley terminated. He knows Ray is out to avenge his time in prison and so pays him $100,000 to come to Los Angeles. Brice, aware of Ray's release and suspicious that he may be up to something, instructs an underling, Danny, (Andy Nyman) to keep an eye on him and find out what he can about his plans. Danny confronts Ray in a busy London street and brings the situation to a head when he makes a comment about Ray's former girlfriend Maggie, whom Ray has not seen since he went to prison. Ray angrily headbutts Danny, telling him to leave him alone. Danny reports this back to Brice, who still believes Ray is up to something. Ray is soon contacted by Jack Rawlings, Terry's father, who beckons him to come and visit. The two have a long talk about Terry and Ray tells Jack how sorry he is for Terry's death. Jack feigns compassion and tells Ray that he wants him to go after the guy who set them up, namely Riley, and gives him a contact in Los Angeles, Eddie, who can help him with the job. Ray is to pick up $100,000 at Jack's club from Big Frankie (Adam Fogerty) and then get on a plane to Los Angeles to hunt Riley down. Upon arrival, Ray immediately goes to London Charlie's house (which is revealed to be the one seen in the beginning of the film) to meet with him. Ray is told that there is $100,000 in a bag that he is to take to Riley and use to recover the tape. Once he has the tape, Ray is to kill Riley and bring the tape back to London Charlie. Ray leaves and begins to cover his tracks by checking into two separate motels. He then makes a call to Eddie to pick up a car for use in Los Angeles. That night he picks up the car and meets Eddie, who is waiting for him in the back seat. Eddie tells him there is a pistol in the glove box and that he doesn't want to get involved in any of the nasty business. Ray acknowledges the request and takes off into the night. The next day, Riley is waiting to meet with London Charlie. He is surprised by Ray, who shows up at his door carrying a bag of cash. Ray has hidden the pistol outside of the apartment and so is clean when he is frisked by Riley. The two have a heated discussion about what happened eight years ago and Riley makes light of Terry's death, much to Ray's chagrin. Ray gives the bag of cash to Riley, who angrily informs him that the amount is only half of what he and London Charlie had agreed to, and ordering him to get him the rest if he wants the tape. Ray exits the apartment, retrieves his pistol, then goes back inside and demands the tape from Riley at gunpoint. Riley refuses, and Ray shoots him once in the chest, then once in the back of the head, killing him. Ray searches the apartment for the tape, but only finds a key to a room at a nearby hotel. Ray returns to his first hotel to wash Riley's blood off of himself before he goes to check out the other hotel. Meanwhile, police are investigating the shooting death at Riley's apartment. Detective Allen (Bruno Kirby) arrives on the crime scene and discovers that there is a link to a nearby hotel‚Äîthe same hotel Ray is also heading to. Detective Bartow (Mark Siciliani) and Officer Chris Anders (Aaron Gallagher) are dispatched to investigate. At the hotel they find Samantha Fay, who is startled by their appearance. When the officers inform her that there has been an incident and they need to take her to the station to answer some questions, she reluctantly agrees. Officer Anders escorts her out, leaving Detective Bartow to search the room. Ray arrives as they are leaving, running into Bartow as he attempts to enter the room. Ray attempts to keep his cool, especially when Bartow tells him he is a police officer. He questions Ray as to how he knew Riley, and Ray innocently says they recently met and that they had arranged to grab a drink. Bartow is suspicious and asks Ray if he would have any objections to coming down to the station for some questioning. Ray has no choice but to agree, and they leave together. At the station, Ray and Samantha are questioned for hours and hours by Detective Allen and Detective Drummond (Anthony LaPaglia). The situation is tense, and they both have a tough time keeping calm. Eventually they are both let go, but not before Samantha is told that Riley is dead. Both leave the station within a couple of hours of each other and head in different directions, Ray to pick up his things at the second motel, and Samantha to pick up the tape and a gun which Riley had left in a safety deposit box earlier that day. Samantha then heads to London Charlie's house to square things away with him and avenge Riley's death. She shoots London Charlie dead in his pool just as Ray arrives to say goodbye. Ray and Samantha have a Mexican stand-off. The now-useless tape is thrown into the pool, and Samantha slowly backs out of the house, leaving Ray to sort out the mess. As Ray sits to contemplate his next move, he doesn't notice Samantha sneaking back inside, who shoots Ray in the back. Samantha leaves and Ray is left in a pool of blood, but still alive. The scene from the film's opening replays as Ray picks up the phone to call Eddie and reaches Dillon, who comes to clean up his mess. Dillon finally gets Ray to a secure location, and Ray pays him off so that he can return to London, where he recuperates for several days in the care of Maggie. Ray thinks quickly about what he should do when he receives a phone call from Eddie, telling him that Jack Rawlings wants to see him on the rooftop of a car-park in Chinatown later that evening. After Eddie hangs up, he anonymously calls Brice and tells him about the meeting. Brice is confused, but eager to settle the score with Ray. He calls Danny to tell him that he should follow Ray to the meeting and kill him. While Danny circles the streets of London in an attempt to find Ray, he stumbles on Maggie and follows her back to her flat. Ray, meanwhile, is visiting with Cindy, whom he had rescued from the streets prior to his departure to Los Angeles and had given shelter to while she attempted to recover from her drug habit. Danny forces his way into Maggie's apartment and, after roughing her up, takes Ray's remaining money and returns to his place. When Ray returns, he grabs Maggie and they head over to Danny's flat. Ray breaks in and finds Nikki (Meredith Ostrom) clutching the bag of money and Danny jamming on drugs. Ray also hears a recording on Danny's answering machine of Brice telling Danny to kill him. Ray kills Danny, then takes the tapes from the answering machine and the bag of money. He and Maggie then leave to head to the rendezvous in Chinatown. Brice arrives at Danny's place a little later after Nikki has called the police, and finds Danny dead. Brice also notices that the tapes from the machine are missing and now has no choice but to show up on the car park rooftop for the inevitable showdown.

Sprint offered both residential and business services. It was a key company in the long- distance wars of Canada. History U.S.-based Sprint Corporation entered the Canadian market in the mid-1990s as a reseller of bulk long-distance telephone lines that it bought from domestic companies. Under Canadian foreign ownership regulations, Sprint could not open its own network. In 1993, Sprint entered into a strategic alliance with Call-Net Enterprises, a Canadian long-distance service, and bought 25 percent of the company. Call-Net's long-distance service was renamed ‚ÄúSprint Canada‚Äù, and expanded to include landline and internet services. In a partnership with Fido Solutions, it offered wireless services. In 2005, Call-Net and Sprint Canada's 600,000 customers (including 31,000 wireless subscribers) were acquired by Rogers Communications.Post, May 18, 2013, ‚ÄúThe short history of telecom startups in Canada‚Äù, Josh Smuel. Services Sprint Canada charged a system access fee for all of its services. The home phone, long-distance and Internet services each had a $4.25 fee, while the Sprint and Fido bundles have a $6.95 fee. For clarity purposes, prices stated in this article already include such fees. =Landline phone= Both traditional and VoIP landline phones were available. =Long distance= Sprint Canada's flagship product was its long-distance. It was available landline and mobile phones. The rates at the time were very competitive and challenged Bell Canada's monopoly. =Internet access= Multiple dial-up Internet access options were available for Sprint Canada customers. Both time- limited and unlimited plans were available. \\"THE MOST online Basic Unlimited\\" had a cost of $23.20 per month and included a single email address. For an additional $3, one could upgrade to \\"THE MOST online XTRA\\", which included Internet call waiting and four additional email addresses. This allowed the customer to answer calls while surfing online. =Wireless= Sprint Canada had a partnership with Fido Solutions. It consisted of bundling Sprint Canada's landline phone service with Fido's wireless phone service. Sprint's long-distance plans could be used on either or both phones, but Fido month minutes would be deducted for any calls made on the Fido phone. Two monthly plans were offered, with different allowances for local wireless minutes: * $51.90 for 150 anytime minutes * $63.90 for 150 daytime minutes and 1000 evening and weekend minutes * $71.90 for 300 daytime minutes and 1000 evening and weekend minutes Daytime minutes could be used from Monday to Friday between 8 am and 7 pm. Evenings and weekend minutes could be used at any time on Saturdays and Sundays. From Monday to Friday, they could only be used between midnight and 8 am, and between 7 pm and midnight. If a customer has any unused minutes at the end of a month, they cannot be carried over to the next month. All plans included call waiting, conference call and 1000 call forwarding minutes. In addition, customers could add two extra calling features at no cost: Caller ID, voicemail, or 50 sent SMS to Canada and the USA. All features could be obtained for $3/month Sprint Canada's wireless division had 31,000 customers in Q3 2005 before being acquired by Rogers Wireless.

Mahakavi Krittibas Ojha (1381‚Äì1461) was a medieval Bengali poet. His major contribution to Bengali literature and culture was Indian epic RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa in Bengali. His work, the ≈örƒ´rƒÅm PƒÅÃÉcƒÅlƒ´, is popularly known as the Krittivasi Ramayan. His work, edited by Jaygopal Tarkalamkar, was published by the Serampore Mission Press. Life Krittibas Ojha was born in a Brahman family at Phulia village of modern-day Nadia district in the Indian state of Paschimbanga (West Bengal). He was the eldest among his father Banamali Ojha's six sons and one daughter. The word \\"Krittibas\\" is an epithet of Hindu god Shiva. It is known that when Krittibas was born, his grandfather Murari Ojha was preparing for a pilgrimage to Chandaneswar in Odisha, hence the child was named after Shiva, the predominant deity of the nearest Odisha pilgrimage to Bengal. At the age of 11, Krittibas was sent to North Bengal (in other opinion, to Nabadwip) for higher studies. After finishing studies he was traditionally honoured by the King of Gauda himself by the offerings of a garland, some sandal water and a silk scarf. Upon returning to his home at Phulia, he translated the Valmiki Ramayana into Bengali.

A weather front is a boundary separating bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift. Cold fronts and occluded fronts generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because of the greater density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. When a front becomes stationary‚Äîand the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes‚Äîthe front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. This is most common over the open ocean. Bergeron classification of air masses The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classifications are indicated by three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant upward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter designates the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.Glossary of Meteorology. Airmass Classification. Retrieved on 2008-05-22. Fronts separate air masses of different types or origins, and are located along troughs of lower pressure. Different air masses which affect North America, as well as other continents, tend to be separated by frontal boundaries. In this illustration, the Arctic front separates Arctic from Polar air masses, while the Polar front separates Polar air from warm air masses. (cA is continental arctic; cP is continental polar; mP is maritime polar; cT is continental tropic; and mT is maritime tropic.) Surface weather analysis thumbupright=1.2Weather map symbols: 1. cold front; 2. warm front; 3. stationary front; 4. occluded front; 5. surface trough; 6. squall/shear line; 7. dry line; 8. tropical wave; 9. trowal A surface weather analysis is a special type of weather map which provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.Monmonier, Mark. Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather. University of Chicago Press. Chicago: 1999. Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea-level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying fair weather. An L on the other hand may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location. Types There are two different meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone. The term \\"anafront\\" describes boundaries which show instability, meaning air rises rapidly along and over the boundary to cause significant weather changes. A \\"katafront\\" is weaker, bringing smaller changes in temperature and moisture, as well as limited rainfall. =Cold front= A cold front is located at the leading edge of the temperature drop off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts often bring heavy thunderstorms, rain, and hail. Cold fronts can produce sharper changes in weather and move up to twice as quickly as warm fronts, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangle-shaped pips pointing in the direction of travel, and it is placed at the leading edge of the cooler air mass. Cold fronts come in association with a low-pressure area. The concept of colder, dense air \\"wedging\\" under the less dense warmer air is often used to depict how air is lifted along a frontal boundary. The cold air wedging underneath warmer air creates the strongest winds just above the ground surface, a phenomenon often associated with property-damaging wind gusts. This lift would then form a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms if enough moisture were present. However, this concept isn't an accurate description of the physical processes; upward motion is not produced because of warm air \\"ramping up\\" cold, dense air, rather, frontogenetical circulation is behind the upward forcing. =Warm front= Warm fronts are at the leading edge of a homogeneous warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface. This also forces temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform, and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after frontal passage. If the warm air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of semicircles pointing in the direction of travel. =Occluded front= Occluded front depiction for the Northern Hemisphere An occluded front is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. The trowal is indicated by a series of blue and red junction lines. =Warm sector= The warm sector is in between the warm front and the cold front. It brings warm weather. The warm sector typically has stratus clouds and has clear and dry days. The air pressure is steady, not high but not low either. =Stationary front= A stationary front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, neither of which is strong enough to replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves.Stationary Front. University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Retrieved on 2006-10-22. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing. A wide variety of weather can be found along a stationary front, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but they can transform into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement. When stationary fronts become smaller in scale, degenerating to a narrow zone where wind direction changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines. A shearline is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes. Stationary fronts may bring snow or rain for a long period of time. =Dry line= A similar phenomenon to a weather front is the dry line, which is the boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences. When the westerlies increase on the north side of surface highs, areas of lowered pressure will form downwind of north‚Äìsouth oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough. Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front. At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture. When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, it can be the focus of diurnal thunderstorms. The dry line may occur anywhere on earth in regions intermediate between desert areas and warm seas. The southern plains west of the Mississippi River in the United States are a particularly favored location. The dry line normally moves eastward during the day and westward at night. A dry line is depicted on National Weather Service (NWS) surface analyses as an orange line with scallops facing into the moist sector. Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the pips indicated do not necessarily reflect the direction of motion. =Squall line= A shelf cloud such as this one can be a sign that a squall is imminent Organized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but can outrun cold fronts in a pattern where the upper level jet splits apart into two streams, with the resultant Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) forming at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern running southeast into the warm sector parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise. Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and outflow boundaries exist ahead of this type of activity, which can act as foci for additional thunderstorm activity later in the day. These features are often depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses and lie within surface troughs. If outflow boundaries or squall lines form over arid regions, a haboob may result. Squall lines are depicted on NWS surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled SQLN or SQUALL LINE, while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. Precipitation produced Convective precipitation Fronts are the principal cause of significant weather. Convective precipitation (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \\"roll clouds\\" and tornadoes may occur. In the warm season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted. Movement Fronts are generally guided by winds aloft, but do not move as quickly. Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, and a warm front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis effect, which is caused by Earth's spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.

The bikes are not mass-produced in continuous series; each unique bike is hand made to order after receiving the buyer's specifications. Guinness World Records considers it as the most expensive production motorcycle. Development Rear view showing the wide rear tire and large bore exhaust When MTT president Ted Mclntyre decided to add a motorcycle to his firm's range, he appointed Christian Travert, a former bike racer and custom builder, to head the project. Early models were powered by a Rolls- Royce-Allison Model 250-C18 gas turbine producing a claimed at 52,000 rpm. Unlike some turbojet-powered motorcycles which relied on jet propulsion for thrust, the Y2K Superbike's turboshaft engine drives the rear wheel via a two- speed gearbox and chain and sprocket. The motorcycles are produced on demand and made to order for buyers. The turbines used in the motorcycles are second- hand, having reached the original manufacturer's mandated running time limit, after which they must be rebuilt regardless of condition. MTT refurbishes the engines and extends a long term warranty with the purchase of every bike. A turbine engine can be easily run on a wide variety of fuels, and so like other turbine engines, the MTT Turbine Superbike does not require jet fuel to operate, since it doesn't have to handle the extremes of temperatures that jet fuel is modified to operate in without coagulating or waxing. MTT has fuelled the Y2K with diesel, kerosene and Bio-Fuel (all similar to jet fuel in composition). Thicker fuel is preferable because it has a higher energy content per unit of fuel, but a turbine can be run off of gasoline or other flammable liquids just as easily, or even powderized fuel such as coal dust if a delivery system is set up for it. Variants In 2006, MTT released the \\"Street Fighter,\\" at the Las Vegas SEMA show. The Street Fighter began the standardization of the more powerful turbine from the Allison 250-C20B engine. In 2015, MTT released two new models. The first was a trike with the 420 HP turbine engine. It features the latest technology and enhanced safety features. The second new bike released by MTT is the 420-RR (Race Ready). The 420-RR is the most extreme bike that MTT produces based on technical advances, aerodynamics and Race Ready enhancements. Reaction The Discovery Channel TV show Greatest Ever: Motorcycles ranked the Turbine Superbike the fourth greatest motorcycle, saying that it held a Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production motorcycle, and that it was also the most expensive. Jay Leno, owner of the first \\"production\\" Y2K Turbine Motorcycle with serial number 002, said, \\"It really does scare you half to death, but it's great fun.\\" Leno also said, \\"I've got to go with the Y2K Jet Bike as one of the all time sexiest. It's the most fun because it's a bike... and it's a jet, and because it's the best motorcycle ever for shutting up the Harley guys.\\" Leno said at a traffic light, the heat from the bike's exhaust melted the bumper of the car behind. Leno said that after he took delivery of his bike, development was ongoing and design changes were being made. At the time, he had ridden his MTT bike about 2000 miles, more than anyone else. Some parts failed during this time, and Leno was supplied with new and redesigned alternatives to try out. McIntyre told Leno that the bikes would be sold only to select buyers, those he thought would take proper care of the turbine engine, which is warrantied for life, and not get themselves killed. Paul Garson praised its audacity. Men's Journal said it is, \\"One the most awe- inspiring, innovative, and otherwise amazing designs. With production limited to five per year it's no wonder the MTT Turbine Superbike has become a revolution\\", in their feature article 'Perfect Stuff'. John Burns, of Motorcyclist, said, \\"Under full power, tracks like a bullet train‚Ä¶and the strangest thing is the complete lack of vibration.

It is about one mile east of Spiro, Oklahoma, and southwest of Fort Smith, Arkansas. It was capital of the Choctaw Nation, capital of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, and in the late 1850s a stop for the Butterfield Stage. It developed as a political and business center of the nation before the Civil War. Skullyville was the site of the Choctaw Agency from 1832 until 1839. During the Civil War, after the Choctaw allied with the Confederacy, the town suffered serious damage in warfare. Afterward the town was bypassed by construction of a new railroad in the area, and it was abandoned by businessmen who moved to the nearest railroad station. In 1917 closure of the post office marked the final decline of the community. It is now considered a ghost town, and little more than the cemetery remains. The name is derived from iskulli or iskuli, the Choctaw word for money, because originally this was the place where members collected their annuity payments at the Choctaw Agency.Morrison, W. B. \\"The Saga of Skullyville\\", Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 16, Number 2, June 1938; Retrieved March 8, 2014. History The Choctaw Indian agency was built on this site in 1832, after the federal government conducted removal of the tribe to Indian Territory. The US Indian agent distributed annuity payments here, and a trading and business community developed around the post. Until 1859, after unification of the three districts of the Nation, the community was officially called \\"Choctaw Agency\\". Major F. W. Armstrong served as the first US agent until his death in 1835. He was succeeded by his brother, William Armstrong. Reportedly, both were very well liked by the Choctaws. Jon D. May, \\"Scullyville,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed March 8, 2014. The Choctaw designated Skullyville, then known as \\"Oak Lodge\\", as county seat of Skullyville County, the capital of the Moshulatubbee District of the Nation, and as the capital of the Choctaw Nation. Dennis Peterson, \\"Fort Coffee,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed September 16, 2012. It also served as a stop on the California Road. Walker's Station, a stage stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail route, was also located in Skullyville. Unusually for the Choctaw Nation's county governments, an extant building from its time as county seat exists: the Skullyville County Jail. The name \\"Skullyville\\" is derived from iskulli or iskuli, the Choctaw word for money, as this was the place for collection of annuity payments at the Choctaw Agency. Author W. B. Morrison suggests that the English meaning of Skullyville was \\"Moneytown\\". In 1834 the US Army built Fort Coffee at Swallow Rock, about north of the Choctaw Agency. The army maintained it for four years; it then reassigned the garrison as no longer needed. Methodist missionaries took over the facility and adapted it as a boys' school, known as Fort Coffee Academy. During the Civil War, the buildings were burned down in the conflict. The school was never reopened. The Methodist Church established New Hope Seminary, a girls' school, in Skullyville during the mid 1840s. It attracted students from all over the Choctaw Nation. It closed during the war, but reopened afterward. It continued to operate until the building burned down in 1896. Skullyville had become a political, educational and social center for the Choctaw during the 1840s. But after the nation moved the national capital to Doaksville in 1850, tensions among factions erupted into more tribal political strife. In 1858 a majority of members adopted the Skullyville Constitution at a convention in Skullyville. It abolished the three districts to unify the nation under one principal leader, known as the governor. Tandy Walker, from a prominent Choctaw family, took over the former Choctaw Agency building when he was appointed in 1858 as supervisor of the Butterfield Stage stop. He was also governor of the unified Choctaw Nation. He adapted this building for use both as his residence and with space for the Butterfield Stage office. Walker retained it as his home until he died in 1877. According to Morrison, the old agency building still stood in the 1930s. The structure is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 72001074). Skullyville began to decline after the Civil War. The Choctaw aligned with the Confederacy and served in their army. The boys' academy and other buildings were burned during warfare. After the Kansas City Southern Railway bypassed it in 1895, the town's businessmen moved to Spiro, the closest railroad station, which they judged essential for their trading and getting products to mark. When the post office closed in 1917, this essentially marked the death of the community. Skullyville is now a ghost town, with only a cemetery remaining. The community is within the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. Notable people * Frank Crawford Armstrong, general in the Confederate Army, born in Skullyville * Douglas H.

She was part of the first generation of black opera singers of Puerto Rican descent to achieve wide success, and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. Arroyo first rose to prominence at the Zurich Opera between 1963‚Äì1965, and then was one of the Metropolitan Opera's leading sopranos between 1965 and 1978. During her 13 years at the Metropolitan Opera, she was also a regular presence at the world's opera houses, performing on the stages of La Scala, Covent Garden, the Op√©ra National de Paris, the Teatro Col√≥n, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Vienna State Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the San Francisco Opera. She is best known for her performances of the Italian spinto repertoire, and in particular, her portrayals of Verdi and Puccini heroines. Her last opera performance was in 1991, after which she has devoted her time to teaching singing on the faculties of various universities in the United States and Europe.Johnston, Laurie. \\"Competition Intense Among Intellectually Gifted 6th Graders for Openings at Hunter College High School; Prominent Alumni Program for Seniors\\", The New York Times, March 21, 1977. Accessed May 11, 2010. On December 8, 2013, Arroyo received a Kennedy Center Honor.Kennedy-Center.org website Early years Arroyo was born in New York City, the younger of two children of Demetrio Arroyo, originally from Puerto Rico, and Lucille Washington, a native of Charleston, South Carolina. Her older brother grew up to become a Baptist minister. The family lived in Harlem near St. Nicholas Avenue and 111th Street. Her father was a mechanical engineer at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and earned a good salary which enabled Arroyo's mother to stay at home with their children. His job also allowed the family to experience New York's cultural offerings and the family frequented museums, concerts, and the theatre. It was attending several performances of Broadway shows during the 1940s that first inspired Arroyo's interest in becoming a performer. Her mother humored her dreams and allowed Arroyo to take ballet classes. Her mother was also a talented amateur classical pianist and taught her daughter to play the instrument. Arroyo's other musical experiences as a child were largely through singing in the choirs at her Baptist church and as a student at Hunter College High School.\\"Paid Notice: Deaths ‚Äì Maurel, Michel, The New York Times, June 5, 2011. Hunter College After finishing high school in 1953, Arroyo attended Hunter College where she earned a B.A. in Romance languages in 1956 at the age of nineteen. While there she studied voice as a hobby in an opera workshop with Joseph Turnau. Turnau recognized that Arroyo was a major talent who just needed proper training. After the workshop ended, he introduced her to voice instructor Marinka Gurewich, who immediately accepted her as a student. When Arroyo did not take her training as seriously as her teacher wanted, Gurewich eventually threatened to end their lessons. Arroyo said of the incident, She further explained that at that point most of the major opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera, had never cast a black singer, so in her mind \\"opera wasn't a real possibility.\\" Gurewich's threat, however, forced her to take her studies more seriously and she continued to study with her until Gurewich's death in 1990. Another important partnership formed around this time was with concert manager Thea Dispeker who, after attending one of Arroyo's recitals, offered her services at no charge until Arroyo's career took off. Dispeker helped manage much of Arroyo's career over the next several decades. Career as a social worker After graduating from college, Arroyo was faced with the difficulty of working while trying to study singing. On the advice of her mother, she became an English teacher at Bronx High School in the Fall of 1956 but found it difficult to balance her teaching responsibilities with continued training under Gurewich. She decided to leave her teaching position and take work as a social worker at the East End Welfare Center. For two years, she managed a case load of over 100 welfare recipients while continuing her voice training. Arroyo found the work fulfilling and stated of the experience, \\"My life had been centered on music for so long, and suddenly there I was, deeply involved in other people's problems,\\". Metropolitan Opera In 1957 Arroyo auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera but was not accepted. Somewhat disheartened, she flirted with the idea of becoming an academic and began working on a master's degree in comparative literature at New York University with a dissertation on Ignacio Silone's Pane e Vino and Vino e Pane. The following year she competed in and won the Metropolitan Opera's Audition of the Air competition (precursor to its National Council Auditions), earning a $1,000 cash prize and a scholarship to the Met's Kathryn Long School. She left NYU and entered the Kathryn Long School in the Fall of 1957 where she studied singing, drama, German, English diction, and fencing. While at the school, she was offered the role of the first coryph√©e in the American premiere of Ildebrando Pizzetti's Murder in the Cathedral to be performed at a festival in upstate New York. The concert, however, was rained out and was rescheduled for a performance at Carnegie Hall instead on September 17, 1958. This marked Arroyo's first professional appearance singing in an opera. The New York Times said of her performance, \\"Martina Arroyo is a gifted soprano who appears to have remarkable potential, and she sang with a voice of amplitude and lovely color.\\" In February 1959 Arroyo sang the title role in Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride in a concert version with the Little Orchestra Society at Town Hall. Shortly thereafter she made her debut on the opera stage at the Metropolitan Opera as the Celestial Voice in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlo on March 14, 1959 with Eugenio Fernandi in the title role, Leonie Rysanek as Elizabeth, Robert Merrill as Rodrigo, and Nell Rankin as Princess Eboli. This was the beginning of a long association with the Met and the beginning of a lengthy career on the opera stage. Musical career After having made her Met debut, Arroyo moved to Europe where she began to appear in roles with minor opera houses in 1959. While performing in Italy of that year she met her future husband, professional violist Emilio Poggioni. The marriage ended in divorce and she later was married to Michel Maurel until his death in 2011. Over the next several years Arroyo worked mostly in Europe in mostly smaller roles, failing to land the larger name-making roles. Those larger parts which she did get were mostly in more obscure works. During 1961 and 1962 she went back and forth between Europe and the Metropolitan Opera frequently, with her roles at the Met during this period being in Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle and in reprises of Don Carlo. Her roles in the Ring included the Third Norn and Woglinde in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Woglinde in Das Rheingold, Ortlinde in Die Walk√ºre, and the Forest Bird in Siegfried. In 1963 Arroyo's first major break came when she was offered a contract to join the Zurich Opera as a principal soprano. She made her debut there in the title role of Verdi's Aida where she was received enthusiastically. She continued to sing regularly at that opera house through 1968. Aida became an important role for Arroyo early in her career, serving as a calling card for her at many major opera houses during the 1960s. She sang the role for her first appearance at the Hamburg State Opera in 1963 and at both the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Vienna State Opera in 1964. In February of the following year she sang Aida in her first starring role at the Met as a last minute replacement for Birgit Nilsson. The performance received rave reviews with The New York Times praising Arroyo as \\"one of the most gorgeous voices before the public today.\\" Rudolf Bing, the Met's director, immediately offered her a contract to join the roster of the company's principal sopranos which extended for several years. Arroyo began the 1965/66 season at the Met in October with a critically acclaimed performance of Elizabeth in Don Carlo. She immediately became a favorite singer at that house portraying mostly Verdi heroines and the Met became her principal home from that point up until 1978. Her other roles at the Met during these thirteen years included Aida, Amelia in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, Cio-Cio-San in Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Donna Anna in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Elvira in Verdi's Ernani, Lady Macbeth in Verdi's Macbeth, Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore, Leonora in Verdi's La forza del destino, Li√π in Puccini's Turandot, Maddalena in Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier, Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, and the title role in Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda among others. She was also notably the first black person to portray the role of Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin in 1968, not just at the Met, but in all of opera history. International Opera Houses During her years at the Met, Arroyo would frequently travel to perform at other houses both in the United States and internationally. In 1968 she sang for the first time in Israel and made her first appearance in the United Kingdom as Valentine in a London concert performance of Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. Later that year she made her debut at the Royal Opera at Covent Garden and the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company, both singing the role of Aida. She returned to both companies a number of times during the 1970s as Verdi heroines and in parts like the title roles in Puccini's Tosca and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos. She sang Amelia in Un ballo in maschera for her debuts with both the San Francisco Opera (1971) and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1972). She returned to Chicago to sing her first Amelia Grimaldi in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra in 1974. In 1972 she sang Aida for her debut at La Scala opposite Pl√°cido Domingo as Radames. In 1973 she made her first appearances at the Op√©ra National de Paris and the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. In 1977 she made her debut with the Opera Company of Philadelphia portraying Senta in Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and in 1979 made her debut with Michigan Opera Theatre as Lenora in Il trovatore. She remained very busy in the world's major opera houses through 1979 singing mostly Verdi, Puccini, and Strauss heroines and other roles from the lirico-spinto repertoire. Arroyo portrayed herself in an episode of The Odd Couple titled \\"Your Mother Wears Army Boots\\", which originally aired on January 16, 1975. The episode also featured Howard Cosell who is portrayed to be a big fan of hers. Retirement By 1980, Arroyo's career had started to slow down and she was much more selective in what roles she chose to take. She returned to the Met in 1986 to sing Aida and Santuzza; making her last appearance and 199th performance at that house on October 31, 1986. In 1987 she sang her last portrayal of the title role in Turandot with the Seattle Opera and in 1989 she announced her retirement from the opera stage. She came out of retirement in 1991 for one last performance in the world premiere of Leslie Adams's Blake, an opera whose story is set in pre-Civil War America when slavery was still a reality. Throughout her career Arroyo was also a frequent performer of the concert repertoire and appeared with many of the world's leading symphony orchestras. She performed often with the New York Philharmonic under conductor Leonard Bernstein who particularly admired her voice in such repertoire as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and Missa Solemnis. Arroyo's talents also extended beyond the concert stage into the realm of live network television. In 1964 she appeared with the CBS Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Alfredo Antonini in the episode \\"Feliz Borinquen\\" of the CBS Repertoire Workshop as herself. Martina Arroyo is a recipient of a 2010 Opera Honors Award from the National Endowment for the Arts. Recordings U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry pose for a photo with the 2013 Kennedy Center honorees -- Shirley MacLaine, Martina Arroyo, Billy Joel, Carlos Santana, and Herbie Hancock at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., on December 7, 2013. Having performed in the major opera houses and with the greatest symphony orchestras of the world, she has left a legacy of recordings, including: Handel's Judas Maccabeus (twice) and Samson, Mozart's Don Giovanni (Donna Elvira for Karl B√∂hm and Donna Anna for Sir Colin Davis), Beethoven's Missa solemnis and Ninth Symphony, Rossini's Stabat mater, Verdi's I vespri siciliani, Un ballo in maschera, La forza del destino (in both the St. Petersburg and revised versions), and the Messa da requiem and Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony the Symphony of a Thousand. She has recorded important 20th-century music, including Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder and the African Oratorio by . She sang in the world premieres of two works: Karlheinz Stockhausen's Momente and Samuel Barber's Andromache's Farewell. Arroyo's discography (which also includes an aria recital), though enviable, does not encompass anything like the full range of roles she played on stage. At the Metropolitan Opera alone, these are the operas she performed but never recorded commercially: Verdi's Ernani, Macbeth, Il trovatore, Don Carlos (the Celestial Voice as well as Elizabeth, both in Italian), and ; Wagner's Lohengrin and Der Ring des Nibelungen (featured roles in all four operas); Ponchielli's La Gioconda; Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier; and Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Turandot (as Li√π; she played the title role in Toronto). Teaching career Since her official retirement from singing in 1989 Arroyo has amassed significant teaching credits, including stints at Louisiana State University, UCLA, University of Delaware, Wilberforce University, the International Sommerakademie-Mozarteum in Salzburg and Indiana University. She has given master classes nationally and internationally, and judged several competitions including the George London Competition and the Tchaikovsky International Competition./With Willard L. Boyd, former President of the University of Iowa, she co-authored the \\"Task Force Report on Music Education in the U.S.\\" Honors In 1976, she was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the National Council of the Arts in Washington, D.C. She founded the Martina Arroyo Foundation, which is dedicated to the development of emerging young opera singers by immersing them in complete role preparation courses. She is also active on the Boards of Trustees of Hunter College and Carnegie Hall. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. She was candid about her perceived status as second-best to her great contemporary, fellow African-American spinto Leontyne Price; once, when a Met doorman greeted her as \\"Miss Price,\\" she sweetly replied, \\"No, honey, I'm the other one.\\"  See also  * List of Puerto Ricans *History of women in Puerto Rico References Notes Sources * Hamilton, David.

With around 12,000 students, the university offers 32 undergraduate programmes and 33 master programmes; all are available in Romanian, 6 in English and 1 in French. Furthermore, there are also two doctoral schools specialised in five fields: Agronomy, Animal Science, Biotechnologies, Horticulture, and Veterinary Medicine. Campus The main university building in the HerƒÉstrƒÉu campus The university has two campuses located in Bucharest, Romania. The HerƒÉstrƒÉu campus, which is the main campus, was established in 1868, and is spread over an area of 38 hectares. It is located north of the city centre, adjacent to HerƒÉstrƒÉu Park (now known as King Michael I Park), Bucharest's largest park. The main campus hosts six of the seven faculties and several of the university's facilities (such as research buildings, student residences, a botanical garden and experimental fields). Since 1887, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine is located at the Cotroceni campus in the centre of Bucharest, along the D√¢mbovi»õa River. This campus has an area of 5.5 hectares, and besides the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and its related facilities, it also hosts student residences and a veterinary clinic (which is open to the general public). History Its origin lies in a document signed in 1852 by Barbu Dimitrie ≈ûtirbei, Ruler of Wallachia (1849‚Äì1856), who founded the Institute of Agriculture in Pantelimon, near Bucharest. The Institute started its activity in 1853, being joined a few years later in 1861 by the School of Veterinary Medicine. The agronomic and veterinary education evolved towards more developed forms, interrelated to the increasing need of specialists in plant and animal breeding, with the development of specialised sciences and knowledge. In 1867, when the curricula expanded to include forestry sciences, the university became the Central School of Agriculture and Forestry. The first experimental didactic farm in Romania was established within this institution. On the 1st of August 1868, King Carol I laid the foundation stone of the new campus on the HerƒÉstrƒÉu Estate in Bucharest, and in 1869, teachers and students started their activity there. In 1887, the first agricultural research institution in Romania, named the Bucharest Agronomic Station, was established within the university and experimental land plots were established on the HerƒÉstrƒÉu lake shore. The first part of the 20th century saw many changes to the structure of the university. In 1915, it was renamed as the Higher School of Agriculture, and in 1921, the School of Veterinary Medicine became a faculty of the University of Bucharest. During the following years, the agronomic education developed further under several names: Higher School of Agriculture from HerƒÉstrƒÉu (1915), Academy of Higher Agronomic Studies (1929), Faculty of Agronomy ‚Äì merged within the Bucharest Polytechnic School (1938), and the Agronomic Institute of Bucharest (1948). In 1948, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine returned to the Agronomic Institute of Bucharest, once again becoming part of the university. In 1992, the name changed to the University of Agronomic Sciences, and in 1996 it became the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest. The University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest has adopted the Bologna Process and European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). The University currently offers programs in Romanian, English and French in all the three cycle: cycle 1 (bachelor's degree), cycle 2 (master's degree) and cycle 3 (doctorate).

Founded in 1559 to educate local boys, it is now coeducational. Wilhelmsgymnasium is one of the few remaining gymnasium in Bavaria to be a \\"pure Humanistisches Gymnasium\\" (humanities gymnasium), meaning that it traditionally focuses on the Classics: all students are required to study Latin, English, and Ancient Greek, in addition to mainstream school subjects. History The Gymnasium was founded in 1559 by Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria as a \\"Paedagogium\\", but was renamed in 1849 after its probable sponsor, Duke Wilhelm V. By 1773, the Gymnasium was overseen by the Jesuits (\\"Jesuit Gymnasium\\"). The present building on Thierschstra√üe (corner of Maximilianstra√üe) was erected in 1879 in Neo-Renaissance style. In 1893 it was granted Seminarschule status, meaning that it accepted trainee teachers. Much of the school compound was destroyed during the Allied bombing of Munich in 1944 and eventually rebuilt over the years. Girls were admitted during the 1970s. Between 2015 and 2018 the school operated out of a temporary location while the historic building's interior was completely gutted and refurbished with modern facilities.

Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford (18 September 1501 ‚Äì 30 April 1563) was an English nobleman. After the execution for treason in 1521 and posthumous attainder of his father Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, with the forfeiture of all the family's estates and titles, he managed to regain some of his family's position and was created Baron Stafford in 1547. However his family never truly recovered from the blow and thenceforward gradually declined into obscurity, with his descendant the 6th Baron being requested by King Charles I in 1639 to surrender the barony on account of his poverty.Cokayne, Complete Peerage, new edition, vol.XII, p.188 Origins He was born on 18 September 1501 at Penshurst Place in Kent, the only son and heir of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1477‚Äì1521), of Stafford Castle in Staffordshire and of Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire, by his wife Eleanor Percy, a daughter of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland and Maud Herbert. Marriage and issue On 16 February 1519, aged 18, he married Ursula Pole, a daughter of Sir Richard Pole by his wife Margaret Plantagenet, suo jure 8th Countess of Salisbury.

He also paid for the wedding expenses, apart from Ursula's wedding clothes which were provided by her mother. Following their marriage, Henry and Ursula lived in the household of his father, where they had guardians to watch over them.Harris, p.56 By Ursula he had about fourteen children, seven sons and seven daughters, of whom twelve names are known:Males customarily listed first * Henry Stafford (b.

In 1547 he petitioned Parliament for restoration in blood, but did not claim any of his father's forfeited land or titles.

Retrieved 17 January 2010. This was the 4th creation of the title Baron Stafford which eventually was surrendered in 1639 by his descendant Roger Stafford, 6th Baron Stafford (called in his youth by the surname \\"Floyde\\"), due to his poverty and \\"very mean and obscure condition\\", at the request of King Charles I.

Under Queen Mary I he converted back to Catholicism and translated two tracts by Erasmus against Luther, of which neither survives. He commissioned other translations, such as Humphrey Lloyd's version of Vassaeus on urine, and influenced the publication of Mirror for Magistrates in 1559.

It features role- playing, strategy, and arcade elements set in feudal Japan. The player begins the game as a little-known vassal samurai; his ultimate goal is to replace Oda Nobunaga as the daimy≈ç responsible for reunifying sengoku Japan. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. The game was re-released in 2014 on Gog.com and Steam with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Gameplay The game begins by giving the player their choice of name, clan, and family specialty. Within the game, death is final and frequently risked; an early priority is establishing a family, which permits the player to continue as the samurai's heir in the event of death or retirement. In the first two sections of the game, the player rises from a minor retainer to a more powerful lieutenant and then to daimy≈ç over his entire clan. At each of these levels, he competes to curry favor from his lord with three computer-controlled rivals who also seek to become first in favor and next in succession. Each samurai has several properties, including land holdings, army size, sword-fighting ability, and generalship. In keeping with the Bushid≈ç theme of the game, army size and honor have the greatest influence over how the samurai are ranked. A wide array of dishonorable actions are also possible. The player (and AI controlled characters) may kidnap and rescue family members, dishonor other samurai, or even assassinate their rivals or lord. Naturally, such behavior carries serious risk. The samurai performs these acts personally and risks capture or death. At minimum, exposure entails loss of honor and land and more serious offenses require ritual suicide (seppuku); a failed attempt on the life of the samurai's lord occasions the extermination of his entire family, losing the game. After becoming a daimy≈ç, the game shifts to a wargame format, with the goal of conquering enough provinces to claim the title of sh≈çgun. The player no longer wanders personally through a provincial map but directs his army through the three lower Japanese islands. He is able to direct his underlings to deal with any sword fight or melee minigames without loss of honor: the focus is on the size of the player's army and mastery of the battlefield tactics. After winning the game, the player is given a final summary of the future of his dynasty. Depending on various factors such as the victor's honor and the presence of an adult heir, the length of the dynasty could range from hundreds of years (like the Tokugawa shogunate) to a quick dissolution after the sh≈çgun's death (as occurred with Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi). Development MicroProse designers Sid Arnold and Lawrence Schick began development of Sword of the Samurai in late 1987, after the success of the company's first role-playing adventure game Sid Meier's Pirates!. They chose to set it during the Sengoku period because the era's chaos made it possible for samurai to gain great power regardless of background, and gave players the goal of uniting the country and becoming sh≈çgun. MicroProse co-owner Sid Meier helped develop the NPCs' artificial intelligence and the dueling. Reception In the February-March 1990 issue of Games International, Brian Walker was disappointed in this game, commenting that although the outside of the box had promised \\"'a role-playing action-adventure simulation' [...] it is none of these things.\\" Although he found combat quite easy and even fun, it failed to advance in challenge as he worked his way through the game; he wrote of the arcade-style combats, \\"they soon pale as you continuously fight the same opponents in the same locations.\\" He did like the graphics, which he called \\"superb and offer a real flavour of Japan\\". He also called the system for fighting strategic army battles \\"the most innovative parts of the game.\\" And he liked the beautifully detailed glossy manual. However, the \\"less than cerebral arcade sequences\\" led Walker to give the game a poor rating of 5 out of 10, although he did give the graphics an excellent rating of 9 out of 10. Jim Trunzo reviewed Sword of the Samurai for White Wolf #20, rating it 4 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"Sword of the Samurai is one of the most complete programs designed. Virtually all aspects of the period of the genre are covered. The storyline is complete and effectively mixes warfare, domestic concerns, and political matters.\\" Computer Gaming World stated in 1990 that Sword of the Samurai \\"offers even more than its spiritual ancestor, Pirates!\\". It praised the game's graphics, soundtrack, and many choices during gameplay. Later that year and in 1993 the magazine gave it four stars out of five, stating that the game did not sell as well as Pirates! despite \\"near perfect\\" game play and historical accuracy.

Obsidian is a volcanic glass that was used by prehistoric people as a raw material in the manufacture of stone tools such as projectile points, knives, or other cutting tools through knapping, or breaking off pieces in a controlled manner, such as pressure flaking. Obsidian obeys the property of mineral hydration, and absorbs water, when exposed to air, at well defined rate. When an unworked nodule of obsidian is initially fractured, there is typically less than 1% water present. Over time, water slowly diffuses into the artifact forming a narrow \\"band,\\" \\"rim,\\" or \\"rind\\" that can be seen and measured with many different techniques such as a high-power microscope with 40‚Äì80 power magnification, depth profiling with SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry), and IR-PAS (infra red photoacoustic spectroscopy). In order to use obsidian hydration for absolute dating, the conditions that the sample has been exposed to and its origin must be understood or compared to samples of a known age (e.g. as a result of radiocarbon dating of associated materials).  History  Obsidian hydration dating was introduced in 1960 by Irving Friedman and Robert Smith of the U.S. Geological Survey. Their initial work focused on obsidians from archaeological sites in western North America. The use of Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in the measurement of obsidian hydration dating was introduced by two independent research teams in 2002. Today the technique is applied extensively by archaeologists to date prehistoric sites and sites from prehistory in California and the Great Basin of North America. It has also been applied in South America, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, including New Zealand and Mediterranean Basin. Techniques = Conventional procedure = To measure the hydration band, a small slice of material is typically cut from an artifact. This sample is ground down to about 30 micrometers thick and mounted on a petrographic slide (this is called a thin section). The hydration rind is then measured under a high-power microscope outfitted with some method for measuring distance, typically in tenths of micrometers. The technician measures the microscopic amount of water absorbed on freshly broken surfaces. The principle behind obsidian hydration dating is simple‚Äìthe longer the artifact surface has been exposed, the thicker the hydration band will be. = Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) procedure = In case of measuring the hydration rim using the depth profiling ability of the secondary ion mass spectrometry technique, the sample is mounted on a holder without any preparation or cutting. This method of measurement is non-destructive. There are two general SIMS modes: static mode and dynamic mode, depending on the primary ion current density, and three different types of mass spectrometers: magnetic sector, quadrupole and time-of-flight (TOF). Any mass-spectrometer can work in static mode (very low ion current, a top mono-atomic layer analysis), and dynamic mode (a high ion current density, in-depth analysis). Although relatively infrequent the use of SIMS on obsidian surface investigations has produced great progress in OHD dating. SIMS in general refers to four instrumental categories according to their operation; static, dynamic, quadrupole, and time-of-flight, TOF. In essence it is a technique with a large resolution on a plethora of chemical elements and molecular structures in an essentially non destructive manner. An approach to OHD with a completely new rationale suggests that refinement of the technique is possible in a manner which improves both its accuracy and precision and potentially expands the utility by generating reliable chronological data. Anovitz et al. presented a model which relied solely on compositionally-dependent diffusion, following numerical solutions (finite difference (FD), or finite element) elaborating on the H+ profile acquired by SIMS. A test of the model followed using results from Mount 65, Chalco in Mexico by Riciputi et al. This technique used numerical calculation to model the formation of the entire diffusion profile as a function of time and fitted the derived curve to the hydrogen profile. The FD equations are based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of water as it diffused into the glass and characteristic points of the SIMS H+ diffusion profile. In Rhodes, Greece, under the direction and invention of Ioannis Liritzis, the dating approach is based on modeling the S-like hydrogen profile by SIMS, following Fick's diffusion law, and an understanding of the surface saturation layer (see Figure). In fact, the saturation layer on the surface forms up to a certain depth depending on factors that include the kinetics of the diffusion mechanism for the water molecules, the specific chemical structure of obsidian, as well as the external conditions affecting diffusion (temperature, relative humidity, and pressure). Together these factors result in the formation of an approximately constant, boundary concentration value, in the external surface layer. Using the end product of diffusion, a phenomenological model has been developed, based on certain initial and boundary conditions and appropriate physicochemical mechanisms, that express the H2O concentration versus depth profile as a diffusion/time equation. This latest advance, the novel secondary ion mass spectrometry‚Äìsurface saturation (SIMS-SS), thus, involves modelling the hydrogen concentration profile of the surface versus depth, whereas the age determination is reached via equations describing the diffusion process, while topographical effects have been confirmed and monitored through atomic force microscopy.  Limitations  Several factors complicate simple correlation of obsidian hydration band thickness with absolute age. Temperature is known to speed up the hydration process. Thus, artifacts exposed to higher temperatures, for example by being at lower elevation, seem to hydrate faster. As well, obsidian chemistry, including the intrinsic water content, seems to affect the rate of hydration. Once an archeologist can control for the geochemical signature of the obsidian (e.g., the \\"source\\") and temperature (usually approximated using an \\"effective hydration temperature\\" or EHT coefficient), he or she may be able to date the artifact using the obsidian hydration technique. Water vapor pressure may also affect the rate of obsidian hydration. The reliability of the method based on Friedman's empirical age equation (x¬≤=kt, where x is the thickness of the hydration rim, k is the diffusion coefficient, and t is the time) is questioned from several grounds regarding temperature dependence, square root of time and determination of diffusion rate per sample and per site, apart of some successful attempts on the procedure and applications.The SIMS-SS age calculation procedure is separated into two major steps. The first step concerns the calculation of a 3rd order fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile (eq.1). The second stage regards the determination of the saturation layer, i.e. its depth and concentration. The whole computing processing is embedded in stand-alone software created in Matlab (version 7.0.1) software package with a graphical user interface and executable under Windows XP. Thus, the SIMS-SS age equation in years before present is given in eq.2: c=e^{a+bx+cx^2+dx^3} Eq.1 Fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile T=\\\\frac{(C_1-C_2)^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1.128}{1-\\\\frac{0.177kC_1}{C_2}}\\\\right)^2}{4Dse\\\\\\\\!f\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!f\\\\left(\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dC}{\\\\mathrm dx}\\\\right_{x=0}\\\\right)^2} Eq.2 The SIMS-SS age equation in years before present Where, Ci is the intrinsic concentration of water, Cs is the saturation concentration, dC/dx is the diffusion coefficient for depth x=0, k is derived from a family of Crank's theoretical diffusion curves, and Ds,eff is an effective diffusion coefficient (eq.3) which relates the inverse gradient of the fit polynomial to well dated samples: :Ds,eff = aDs \\\\+ b/ (1022Ds) = 8.051e‚àí6Ds+0.999/(1022Ds), Eq.3 where Ds = (1/(dC/dx))10‚àí11 assuming a constant flux and taken as unity. The eq.(2) and assumption of unity is a matter of further investigation. Several commercial companies and university laboratories provide obsidian hydration services.

He is the son of philosopher Robert Paul Wolff and brother of law professor Tobias Barrington Wolff. Wolff won the United States Chess Championship in 1992 and 1995. Chess career In addition to his two United States championships (1992 and 1995), Wolff also had a distinguished scholastic chess career, winning the 1983 National High School Championship and the 1987 U.S. Junior Championship. In 1988, in a game played in New York City, Wolff defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov during a simultaneous exhibition in just 25 moves with the black pieces: > 1.c4 e5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 c6 4.d4 exd4 5.Qxd4 d5 6.cxd5 cxd5 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.Qa4 > Be7 9.0-0 0-0 10.Be3 Ng4 11.Bd4 Nxd4 12.Nxd4 Qb6 13.Nc3 Qh6 14.h4 g5 15.Nxd5 > Bd8 16.Rac1 gxh4 17.Rxc8 hxg3 18.Nf3 Nh2 19.Rfc1 Rxc8 20.Rxc8 Nxf3+ 21.exf3 > gxf2+ 22.Kf1 Qd2 23.Nf6+ Kg7 24.Ne8+ Kh8 25.Qe4 Bh4 0‚Äì1 This game, although played as part of a simultaneous exhibition against five other masters, was one of Kasparov's shortest losses in his career. In 1995, the same year he won his second United States championship, Wolff served as a second to challenger Viswanathan Anand in preparation for the Classical World Chess Championship 1995 match against champion Kasparov. Although Anand led the match after nine games, Kasparov eventually prevailed 10.5 to 7.5. Wolff is also the author of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess. He graduated from Harvard College in 1996, and the trophy of the annual Harvard-Yale intercollegiate chess match is named the Wolff Cup in his honor, as he remains the only grandmaster to participate in the match as a member of both colleges (beginning at Yale and graduating from Harvard). Investing career Wolff was previously a managing director at San Francisco hedge fund Clarium, which is a $3B global macro hedge fund. He left Clarium to launch Grandmaster Capital Management, a hedge fund that received seed capital from Peter Thiel, the founder of Clarium and a strong chess player himself. Hedge Fund Alert reported that Wolff started the wind-down process of Grandmaster Capital in June 2015. Over the past several years, Wolff has given a blindfolded simultaneous exhibition for all-comers at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska headed by CEO Warren Buffett and Vice- Chairman Charlie Munger.

Del Valle in Manhattan, New York City) is a rapper of Puerto Rican descent. He is a former member of the rap group Killarmy and also has a solo career. He is also known as P.R. Terrorist, but he has rarely used this name since the September 11, 2001 attacks afraid that it may be taken the wrong way and affect sales.Hip Hop Interview - \\"Dom Pachino of Killarmy in the Trenches\\"  Biography  Dom Pachino was born in uptown Manhattan and later moved to Staten Island's Stapleton Houses. He started out by showcasing his talents in public school lunch rooms while urging friends would provide a beat for him by banging on tables with fist and bare knuckles. During that period he became good friends with RZA's younger brother 9th Prince and they would later form the group Killarmy. He went from rapping in the survival dorms of C-74 and C-76 in Riker‚Äôs Island Correctional Facility, while completing his juvenile bid for Gun possession and Assault charges, to making a name for himself locally in the slums of Staten Island's then small hip hop circles in the early 1990s. Experiencing three successful major releases (two through Priority Records, and one through Loud Records) with a debut album that cracked the top ten billboard charts, three world tours with Wu-Tang Clan and countless features on gold albums such as RZA‚Äôs first Bobby Digital project and Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm compilation. Riding off the success of his last group album in 2002, Pachino established his own independent record company called Napalm Recordings, which he released a slew of underground mix tapes and albums via online, mom and pop record stores, and digitally. He also completed an international tour headlining venues in the United States, South America, Europe, and Africa. He has appeared on programs in the United States such as Comedy Central and the Larry Sanders Show. He is now working as a solo artist, producer and director.

The town is west of May and east of Elmwood on US Route 412. The land upon which part of the town sits was homesteaded by Joseph L. Johnston. It sits on the northwest corner of the land Johnson had acquired with a government claim in 1904, three years before Oklahoma became a state. With the construction of Highway Three across Oklahoma during the Great Depression, Tom Lemmons, who had bought the Johnson homestead, moved a chicken coop to where the highway passed his land. In the chicken coop, he started a store. He told the Tulsa Tribune he had nothing else to do during the depression, so he thought he'd start a town. He named his town Nye, after the Progressive U.S. Senator Gerald Nye (R-ND). The name Slapout, according to local legend, came about because customers at the store in Nye were often told by Lemmon's sister that the store was \\"slapout\\" of whatever they wanted.Shirk, George H. Oklahoma Place Names, Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965, p.193. Tom Lemmons insisted his sister never used the phrase. However, the name stuck. When Tom continued to insist his side of the highway was called Nye, patrons responded that the south side of the highway could be \\"Slapout\\", and that the north side with Lemmon's store could be \\"Nye Out.\\" Tom Lemmons finally gave in when a tornado came through town and only took out his Nye sign. After that, both sides were known as Slapout. At one time, the town had 10 inhabitants and included the Hagan Grocery on the south side of the highway. Lemmons also built a building to house his rock collection. Today, the gas station in the town is a regular stop for Tulsa and Oklahoma City skiers traveling to Colorado. The town was featured in a newspaper photo essay by Robert R. Mercer in the Tulsa Tribune in the 1970s.

Note the prominent trussing and visual use of vertical beams. The Stick style was a late-19th-century American architectural style, transitional between the Carpenter Gothic style of the mid-19th century, and the Queen Anne style that it had evolved into by the 1890s. It is named after its use of linear \\"stickwork\\" (overlay board strips) on the outside walls to mimic an exposed half-timbered frame. Characteristics The style sought to bring a translation of the balloon framing that had risen in popularity during the middle of the century, by alluding to it through plain trim boards, soffits, aprons, and other decorative features. Stick-style architecture is recognizable by the relatively plain layout, often accented with trusses on the gables or decorative shingles. The stickwork decoration is not structurally significant, being just narrow planks or thin projections applied over the wall's clapboards. The planks intersect mostly at right angles, and sometimes diagonally as well, resembling the half-timbering of medieval ‚Äì especially Tudor ‚Äì buildings. The style was commonly used in houses, train stations, life-saving stations, and other buildings from the era. The Stick style did have several characteristics in common with the later Queen Anne style: interpenetrating roof planes with bold panelled brick chimneys, the wrap-around porch, spindle detailing, the \\"panelled\\" sectioning of blank wall, radiating spindle details at the gable peaks. Highly stylized and decorative versions of the Stick style are often referred to as Eastlake. =Stick- Eastlake= Stick-Eastlake is a style term that uses details from the Eastlake Movement, started by Charles Eastlake, of decorative arts on Stick-style buildings. It is sometimes referred to as Victorian Stick, a variation of Stick and Eastlake styles. Stick-Eastlake enjoyed modest popularity in the late 19th century, but there are relatively few surviving examples of the style when compared to other more popular styles of Victorian architecture.

Biography Jackson was born in New York City, New York and grew up Crown Heights, Brooklyn with his brother William Jackson. He negotiated his first deal while finishing high school and was a prot√©g√© of the Wu-Tang Clan having grown particularly close with various members. Jackson later secured a distribution deal through Navarre Distribution, with whom he released his debut album Heist of the Century in 1998. He later toured with several singers and groups such as 50 Cent and the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as launching his own management company and children's clothing store. Jackson later relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked with Aphilliates Music Group and Embassy Entertainment, later negotiating a joint-venture deal with both companies for Universal Records. He also worked in a business capacity for DJ Drama, setting up booking arrangements and endorsement deals. Jackson also executive produced the album Gangsta Grillz vol.1 and vol.2 which both albums hit #2 and #4 on the Billboard charts. He is the older brother of rapper Willie the Kid. Reception Though Lason Jackson's Heist of the Century album was largely panned by WARR.org, it wrote, ‚Äúthere is a lot of the unique energy that characterizes most Wu-Tang releases,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey make a strong argument for picking this up especially if you‚Äôre a Wu completist\\". The independently- released Heist of the Century later peaked at 37 on Billboard's \\"R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums\\" in May 1998. Rapper/actor Drake mentioned Jackson during a MTV interview calling him one of the \\"Hottest MCs in the Game\\". Vibe praised Jackson's participation in the Uncontrolled Substance album, calling his overtures \\"seductive\\".

He is best known as a member of Sunz of Man, an early affiliate group of the Wu-Tang Clan. Razah is rumored to have suffered a brain aneurysm in April 2010. He was quick to recover and continue recording. He came to adopt the moniker Heaven Razah.  Recording history  = Da Last Future & Sunz of Man = Razah made his rap debut in the early 90s as a member of the group Da Last Future, an early incarnation of the Sunz of Man, which included Killah Priest, Shabazz the Disciple, Prodigal Sunn, Supreme and 7th Ambassador. Razah and 7th Ambassador self-released the single \\"Livin' in Hell\\" b/w \\"Mental Combat\\" independently before the group adopted the Sunz of Man moniker. Razah recorded a number of tracks with the group before their induction into the Wu-Tang family, including \\"Deep in the Water\\", \\"Writing Rhymes With a Liquid Pen\\" (aka \\"Elements\\"), \\"Lulla Bye\\" and \\"Psychic Hotline\\". In 1995, the group adopted the moniker Sunz of Man, and signed a record deal with Wu-Tang/Priority Records. SoM released a number of singles on Wu-Tang Records, including \\"Soldiers of Darkness\\", \\"No Love Without Hate\\" and \\"Bloody Choices\\", in anticipation of their 1996 debut album Nothing New Under the Sun. Due to internal conflicts and label complications, the album was shelved. Sunz of Man later signed a record deal with Red Ant Entertainment for the release of their official 1998 debut The Last Shall Be First, with the group's roster shaved down to just Razah, Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn and 60 Second Assassin. The album was one of the most successful Wu-Tang affiliate releases, debuting at No. 20 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and No. 7 on the R&B;/Hip-Hop chart. After the departure of Killah Priest in 1998, the group took a hiatus. 1999 saw the release of The First Testament, which featured previously recorded material from the group, including the early tracks from Da Last Future. Razah, Prodigal Sunn and 60 Second Assassin returned in 2002 with the album Saviorz Day, the second official Sunz of Man studio album. The group has yet to release a third studio album, but it has been reported that the group has reconciled with Shabazz the Disciple, Killah Priest and Supreme. = Solo career = Razah made his solo debut in 2001, though quietly, with the independent release When All Hell Breaks Loose. The album featured guest appearances from 7th Ambassador, Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn and Timbo King of Royal Fam, and production from Supreme. The album spawned the single \\"Champaigne Room\\" b/w \\"Ghetto Love\\". The tracks \\"Must B tha Music\\", \\"Oh! Now You Bangin'\\", \\"Ghetto Government\\", \\"Champaigne Room\\", \\"Like It or Not\\", \\"What We Came to Do\\", \\"B.B.P. (Business Before Pleasure)\\" and \\"Rowdy, Rowdy\\" made up roughly half of the 2004 Sunz of Man compilation Elements, with the other half made up of tracks from The First Testament. Razah's next solo album, Renaissance Child, was released in early 2007 on Nature Sounds Records. The album featured appearances from Timbo King, Tragedy Khadafi, R.A. The Rugged Man, Talib Kweli, Viktor Vaughn, Bronze Nazareth, Killah Priest and Ras Kass, and production from Godz Wrath, MF DOOM, Bronze Nazareth, Krohme and 4th Disciple. The album was a well-received, critical success and featured the singles \\"The Renaissance\\" and \\"Buried Alive\\" b/w \\"Project Jazz\\". In October 2007, Razah released his next album, Razah's Ladder, entirely produced by the production duo Blue Sky Black Death. The album also was acclaimed, due to BSBD's soulful production work, and also to Razah's new spiritual lyrical direction, inspired by the recent death of his father. The album featured guest appearances from Prodigal Sunn, Shabazz the Disciple, Crooked I, Ill Bill and Sabac Red, and featured no singles. Self-funded videos were shot for the tracks \\"Razah's Ladder\\" and \\"Audiobiography\\", the latter directed by Sunz of Man producer Supreme, and \\"Razah's Ladder\\", = Collaborations = In 2004, Hell Razah and 4th Disciple released a full-length collaboration album, Freedom of Speech, under the title \\"Sunz of Man presents\\". The album featured fifteen newly recorded tracks with 4th Disciple, and five other previously released tracks from When All Hell Breaks Loose. The album featured the single \\"Article One\\" b/w \\"Project Love\\". In 2005, Razah, Killah Priest, Royal Fam's Timbo King, Tragedy Khadafi and William Cooper formed the underground supergroup Black Market Militia. The group released their self-titled debut album Black Market Militia that same year, with production from Godz Wrath and Bronze Nazareth, and guest appearances from dead prez and Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets. The album spawned the singles \\"Audobon Ballroom\\" b/w \\"Thug Nation\\"/\\"Hood Lullabye\\" and \\"Gem Stars\\" b/w \\"Mayday!\\". Razah's next album collaboration album was with Shabazz the Disciple and producer Ayatollah as the group T.H.U.G. Angelz, titled Welcome to Red Hook Houses, to be released on July 8, 2008 on Babygrande Records.

In an October 2007 interview, Razah also announced plans for numerous other releases for the year. He announced that the Sunz of Man were reunited and planned on releasing an album sometime soon. He also stated that The Maccabeez, a group consisting of himself, Killah Priest and Timbo King, were nearly finished recording their debut album. Black Market Militia are also planning for another album. Another possible release is a collaboration between Razah, Shabazz and Blue Sky Black Death, and a project from G.G.O. (Ghetto Government Officialz), which consists of Razah, 7th Ambassador, Lazarus, Face God and other Red Hook locals. Hell Razah suffered a Brain Aneurysm in 2010. After surviving that near death experience, he began to go under the name Heaven Razah. In 2011, Hell Razah's health was improving and he said on Twitter several albums will come out in the future, including Heaven Razah 2, the second album with Shabazz the Disciple as T.H.U.G.

From January onwards, she was played by Eileen Derbyshire. Derbyshire announced in November 2015 that she would be taking a sabbatical from the show and Emily departed on 1 January 2016 after 55 years on screen.

She later confides in her friend Valerie Barlow (Anne Reid) that she has no regrets about the encounter; Emily is, by that time, 39 years old and assumes it will be now or never. With Miklos out of the picture, Emily falls in love with mild-mannered Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) after meeting him at his mother's funeral in 1969. Their courtship is tested many times over and lasts for three years. They get engaged in 1971. The next year, Ernest is jailed while in Majorca; when he is subsequently freed, Emily and Ernest decide to get married. The wedding was broadcast across the UK on Easter Monday (3 April 1972). Despite rough patches, Emily and Ernest's marriage is relatively stable and they love each other very much. Emily miscarries and later starts menopause, dashing their chances of having a child of their own. This leads to many arguments between them, and they are forced to re-evaluate their marriage after just two years. They turn to short-term fostering to assuage Emily's need to connect with young children. Tragedy strikes when Ernest is shot and killed in a botched robbery, leaving Emily devastated. Emily only starts to heal from heartbreak by playing with a baby, namely Deirdre Langton's (Anne Kirkbride) infant daughter Tracy (Christabel Finch). To occupy her time more interestingly, Emily leaves her post at the local hospital and becomes manager of a caf√©, with Gail Potter (Helen Worth) as her assistant. When the cafe is abruptly sold and new owner Jim Sedgwick (Michael O'Hagan) makes drastic changes to the food and service, Emily walks out and Gail takes over, although eventually Jim's wife Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) starts managing the cafe. In many respects, Emily has never let Ernest go but does marry again, to Arnold Swain (George Waring). He unfortunately turns out to be a bigamist. After she ends their relationship, he visits her and plans a murder-suicide. Emily tells him that God would not approve of what he is doing but Arnold insists she is wrong and goes upstairs to find a Bible. While he is gone, Emily runs outside for help. Arnold is sent to an institution where he dies ten months later. When factory boss Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) needs a new wages clerk, he turns to Emily and she starts working in the same job held by her husband at the time of his death. In June 1992, Emily has a mental breakdown. She can't remember appointments, becomes confused and her appearance suffers. Lodger Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), protects her, covering up these very unusual actions. He becomes increasingly concerned about her behaviour and alerts Emily's friends and neighbours. One day, Emily disappears without a word. When friends and neighbours ignore Percy's call for help, he calls the police who find Emily wandering aimlessly, clearly having suffered a breakdown. When Emily has recovered enough to leave hospital, she tells Percy that he is a good friend, and thanks him for all he had done. Percy later leaves. Emily falls in love once more, with Bernard, a vicar. He breaks off the engagement when he finds out she had suffered a mental breakdown. Because of his own past mental conditions, he cannot face the possibility of it recurring. Since then, Emily has sworn off love completely, pushing herself into more topical endeavours instead. When her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock) arrives on the scene, Emily takes him in and they become fast friends as well as partners in saving the Red Rec from Alf Roberts' (Bryan Mosley) proposed plans for a \\"Millennium Bowl\\". Emily spends a night up in a tree standing by her convictions that the Red Rec is the last green space in Weatherfield and it deserves preservation. Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), Gail's husband, attempts to murder Emily for monetary reasons. He breaks in while she is watching television and babysitting for Ashley (Steven Arnold) and Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Richard knocks her unconscious with a crowbar but is interrupted by Maxine's early return. He attacks Maxine with the same weapon, killing her instantly. Emily makes a full recovery but suffers terrible guilt for surviving when Maxine didn't. She prevents a murder when grief-crazed Brenda Fearns (Julia Deakin) almost jumps off a forty-three foot church tower with baby Bethany Platt (Amy & Emily Walton). Emily befriends Ed Jackson (Chris Walker), a new member of the congregation at her church. He soon becomes a regular visitor to her house, doing odd jobs and they remain friends after he confesses that he has recently been released from prison. However, Emily is devastated when Ed admits why he has been in prison‚Äîhe was the man who shot and killed Ernest. He tells her that, after finding God while in prison, he has come looking for her, attempting to atone for his misdemeanours. Enraged, Emily throws him out, and goes on to question her faith. Eventually, Emily forgives Ed as he contemplates suicide, and gives him Ernest's camera as a keepsake, asking him to send her a photo of him every year so that she can make sure he is alive and well. When Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) finds an envelope in Emily's drawer while looking to see what her PIN was when she has forgotten it. The envelope reads: \\"to be opened after my death\\". Norris tells Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) about it and she tells Emily about the situation so Emily agrees to tell Norris. She makes him promise not to tell anyone but it turns out that the envelope contains plans for her funeral. Norris discovers that this envelope isn't the one he has seen and tries hard to find out what really is in the envelope. It is revealed to be old photos of Rita from her singing days. Emily encounters Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), a former resident of the street, when she is working at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital. Taking pity on him as he has no home to go to, Emily invites him to come and lodge with her and Norris. When Jed later goes missing, Emily is worried as he has left his cap behind. When Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) returns from holiday she is surprised to learn that Jed has disappeared as they both had believed Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) was a killer. After Maria accuses Tony of killing Jed both Maria and Emily are relieved when Jed turns up \\"unharmed\\" but Jed is really hiding marks on his neck from when Tony had strangled him. Emily is later upset to hear that Jed has suffered a second heart attack after he receives a visit from Tony's henchman. Norris' half-brother Ramsay Clegg (Andrew Sachs) arrives after them not seeing each for many years. Emily tries to get Norris to forgive Ramsay before his return to Australia, and in doing so begins to fall for the man. She is very upset when he departs the Street, and is later shocked when he dies suddenly on his flight. She condemns Norris for treating Ramsay in the cold manner that he did. Emily later forgives Norris for his treatment of Ramsay. Emily took in Tracy (now played by Kate Ford) and her daughter Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney) as lodgers in her front parlour, after they were made homeless. However, she kicks them out after Tracy deliberately ruins Ernest's pair of shoes believing them to be Norris'. Emily told Norris of her ambition to do charity work in Peru and to see her nephew, Spider again, she booked a flight and she departed the street. In early 2018, Ken Barlow (William Roache) told Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) that Emily was back in the country, to look after a sick Freda. Ken told Sophie that they might see Emily back in Weatherfield soon. In April, Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) mentions to her son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace) and his wife Angie (Victoria Ekanoye) that Norris has visited Emily in Scotland. On 9 October 2019, Emily spoke to Ken via Skype to wish him a happy 80th birthday. Creation =Casting= In December 1960, actress Eileen Derbyshire was approached by Granada to play a part in the show, but the actress was tied up in a Christmas stage play. Of this Derbyshire said: \\"Four weeks after it started (airing) they said I could either wait until they introduced a new family into the programme or take the tiny part of a little, shy woman helper at the Mission Hall\\" going on to say \\"I have always been a fatalist, so I took the bird in one hand, not realising what a momentous decision I was making\\". =Background= An early image of Emily Bishop (then Nugent) as she appeared in 1961 The character of Emily was introduced when actress Eileen Derbyshire took on the role in Episode 15 on Friday, 27 January. At first, the character was simply called \\"Miss Nugent\\"; it wasn't until 1962 that she was given the name \\"Emily\\" by the show's writers. She continued to be credited on the programme as \\"Miss Nugent\\" until 1969. Although rarely seen, the set of Emily's kitchen is the oldest surviving set. (The second-oldest set is Ken's kitchen, with the famous avocado-green tiles.) All other sets have been redecorated at least once since we first saw Emily's kitchen. Emily's back room/parlour, however, was redecorated off screen. In the story a fire was caused by a candle left unattended by Spider and Toyah when they made their way upstairs after a romantic evening. Spider was able to track down matching wallpaper to cover up the fire damage so that Emily would not know what had happened, but in reality, the wallpaper was no longer obtainable, so the whole set was re-decorated in a very similar style. Emily has lived at No. 3 Coronation Street since 1972. It is mentioned that Emily is from Harrogate. Development During an interview in 1991, Derbyshire spoke about her character's thirty years in the show, stating: \\"The writers have a tough enough task as it is, trying to find new storylines for a character who has been in the serial for three decades.\\" Going on to say \\"I just get on with it. Emily has had a more colourful past than you might think. She has had lots of men friends and liaisons. In the early days, when they were stuck for something to do with her, I think the writers used to say 'Let's give Emily another boyfriend.' I've lost count of the number of men friends she has had\\". Over the years, the character has proved her good neighbour image by taking in a number of lodgers, most notably Percy Sugden, Curly Watts, her nephew Spider, Rita Tanner and current lodger Norris Cole. =Departure and brief return= In November 2015, Coronation Street confirmed that Derbyshire had requested a six-month break with immediate effect, which she was granted. Derbyshire was one of four cast members to announce their temporary exit around the same time as Alison King who plays Carla Connor, David Neilson who plays Roy Cropper and Les Dennis who plays Michael Rodwell also announced that they would be temporarily departing. Derbyshire's exit scenes aired on 1 January 2016 in which Emily left the street to visit her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock). Derbyshire later extended her leave until the end of 2016. In November 2016, it was reported that Derbyshire would not be reprising the role. A source told The Sun that there was \\"no expectation that she will be back\\". They went on to say: \\"All of her cast mates have accepted she won't be returning. She's 85 and has been out of the show for a year, so she probably would have found it tough to get back into the fast pace of filming.\\" However, a spokesperson later said the door is still open for her when she is ready, saying: \\"Eileen is taking an extended break, and has given no indication that she doesn't plan to return.\\"Coronation Street deny Emily Bishop star Eileen Derbyshire has quit  Metro News During an episode broadcast on 3 January 2018, Ken Barlow remarked to Sophie Webster that Emily had returned to the UK to look after her niece Freda, who had fallen ill. This led to speculation that the character would soon be returning to the show. In April 2019, producer Iain MacLeod stated that there are no plans to bring Emily back at the moment, but the door will be left open for a possible future return. However four months later on 9 August 2019, it was announced that Derbyshire had agreed to return briefly to reprise her role as Emily Bishop. She appeared in the first episode on 9 October 2019 in a special video message to Ken Barlow to mark his 80th birthday. Reception In 2001, a storyline involving Emily lending her nephew Spider ¬£15,000 for a new business venture was criticised for not being authentic. Journalist Tony Bridgland writing for the Telegraph said of the plot; \\"It is beginning to look as though Coronation Street's researchers failed to do enough homework to make their plot watertight.\\" The Guardian compiled a list of ten favourite Christmas moments from soap; on the list was the 2002 Christmas episode where Richard Hillman came close to suffocating Emily with a pillow as she slept. Discussing the scene where Emily was attacked by Richard Hillman in 2003, critic Chris Diamond wryly commented: \\"Surely Emily wouldn't be in the line of fire? Poor, drippy, sensible shoes Emily? But she was and the scene where Richard laid the blow on her was one of the most genuinely shocking things I have ever seen on television. I just couldn't believe my eyes. And that was where the genius of the episode lay. I knew Emily was going to get it. I saw Richard creeping up behind her and I was fully cognisant of the fact that the crowbar in his hand was not for snagging her cardie. But I was sure that even at this point something was going to happen that would divert Richard from his target. When the blow actually fell I was utterly amazed.\\" Dek Hogan writing for media website Digital Spy in 2005 praised Eileen Derbyshire's comedic abilities; \\"the book club storyline doesn't exactly fill me with joy but does have the advantage of giving some fine comedic material to the underused talents of Eileen Derbyshire. As Emily Bishop she has shown a major flair for these scenes in the past.\\" In 2006, writer Eve-Marie Wilson in an article criticised the plot which saw Emily forgiving her husband's killer: \\"...on Coronation Street recently, Emily Bishop was having a crisis of conscience, could she or couldn‚Äôt she forgive Ed, the man who had killed her husband all those years ago. After two or three episodes the matter was resolved. Had that incident occurred on a soap opera she‚Äôd still be undecided six months later!\\" In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture commented that Emily is underused in storylines, but praised her stating: \\"Emily is one of those characters who seems to have always been around but rarely gets singled out for attention, yet she can be both funny and heartbreaking. She's really stood out in her scenes this month and has been the only good thing about the Norris/Ramsay storyline of infinite tedium.\\" In the book \\"Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps\\", Christine Geraghty describes Emily as being \\"shy, frightened of speaking out until roused, a spinster type whose complex marital history is seldom referred to\\".

The name comes from the tobacco company founded in 1873 called \\"Liggett & Myers\\", predecessor of today's Liggett Group in which L&M; was originally produced. History \\"L&M;\\" was launched in 1885 by Liggett & Myers as a plug chewing tobacco. In 1952 or 1953, the first L&M; cigarettes were created and they were one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest brand to have a filter that was not a one-sided filter. When \\"L&M;\\" was launched, their motto was \\"American cigarettes of the highest quality with the best filter\\". When their success in the American market was solidified, Liggett Group made a proposal to take the brand international. In 1999, the L&M; trademark rights were acquired by the largest tobacco company in the United States, Philip Morris, and are still produced by them today. Advertisement to promote a visit to the factory were L&M; and other brands were made The brand is popular in Latin America, central and northern Europe, the Arab World and the far east and south Asia. They were not very common in the continental US until a new roll out made them available in October 2007. According to the information of the independent agency of field investigation \\"Business Analytics\\", the second quarter of 2007, Phillip Morris brands took the first place in 25 Russian cities with a market share of 29.92%. During a press conference, it was reported that \\"L&M;\\" takes third place in the world by sales volume. Also, the \\"L&M;\\" brand took second place among other cigarette brands produced by Phillip Morris International. Due to the labeling regulations in Europe banning the use of the word 'lights', the names used to indicate the strength of the cigarettes had been changed, e.g., L&M; Lights are now called L&M; Blue Label. The same happened in 2010 in the U.S. when the Food and Drug Administration banned flavour descriptors‚Äîsuch as \\"mild,\\" \\"light\\" and \\"ultra light\\"‚Äîeven though the color designations were already changed like in Europe. In December 1997, the ingredients that go into L&M; cigarettes were displayed on the cartons. In addition to blended tobacco and water, the 26 ingredients that go into L&M; cigarettes include molasses, phenylacetic acid and oil of patchouli. L&M; was the fourth largest cigarette brand in the world, with 92 billion cigarettes produced in 2007. In 2016, L&M; had a volume of 97 billion produced cigarettes. It is the third best-selling international cigarette brand outside the United States and China. Marketing Over the years, Liggett & Myers made many poster and magazine advertisements to promote the brand, which included famous slogans such as \\"No cigarette ever went so far so fast!\\". Hollywood celebrities such as Barbara Stanwyck, Rosalind Russell and Fredric March starred in various print advertisement to promote the brand by claiming that L&M; filters were \\"Just what the doctor ordered!\\". Various TV advertisements were also created. The most known ones were the \\"Just What The Doctor Ordered\\", \\"Live Modern\\", \\"Stay Fresh, Stay Fresh With L&M;\\", and \\"Come On Over To The L&M; Side\\" ads. Markets L&M; cigarettes are sold in the United States, Mexico, PER√ö Ireland, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Poland, India, Czech Republic, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates, Thailand Guatemala, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Controversy =L&M; and doctor-approved cigarettes= In the 1950s, L&M; introduced an ad campaign called \\"Just What The Doctor Ordered!\\". This campaign came at the time L&M; introduced the first filtered cigarette that became popular. In these L&M; advertisements from the early 1950s, \\"just what the doctor ordered\\" had a double-meaning. Not only did it imply that L&M; cigarettes were satisfying in that they offered both flavour and protection, but it also implied that doctors approved of the brand, a testament to the brand's healthfulness. In a typical advertisement that appeared in a February 1954 issue of Life magazine, Hollywood star Fredric March made an assertion after having read the letter written by a \\"Dr Darkis\\" that was inset into the advertisement. Darkis explained in this letter that L&M; filters used a \\"highly purified alpha cellulose\\" that was \\"entirely harmless\\" and \\"effectively filtered the smoke\\". Similar contemporaneous advertisements from Viceroy claimed that their filtered cigarettes were healthy because doctors recommended Viceroys to patients. Obviously, these ads claimed health benefits for filters, though filters actually did little to truly reduce the hazards of smoking. In fact, tobacco industry chemists were well aware that most filters actually removed no more tar and nicotine than would the same length of tobacco. However, a series of Reader's Digest articles worked to publicize these dubious health claims for filters in the 1950s. One such article, entitled \\"How Harmful are Cigarettes?\\" (1950), noted that artificial filters took out some nicotine since people were aware that nicotine was a killer. The article stated that silica-gel cartridges removed 60% of nicotine from cigarettes. This article spurred Viceroy to print advertisements a week later which read: \\"Reader's Digest tells why filtered cigarette smoke is better for your health.\\" These health claims sparked a boom in Viceroy cigarette sales as well as an onslaught of new filter cigarette brands flooding the market. Kent was introduced in 1952 with a filter made of treated asbestos on crepe paper. In 1953, L&M; followed with a miracle tip and Philip Morris advertised its di- ethylene glycol (Di-Gl) filter cigarette as the cigarette that took the fear out of smoking. In the next two years, Marlboro was re-released as a filter cigarette which targeted men (it had previously been a cigarette targeting women, with a beauty tip to protect the lips), and Winston was introduced with an advertising budget of $15 million. =Bulgarian Customs destroy counterfeit L&M; cigarettes= On July 21, 2011, the Bulgarian customs authorities and Phillip Morris Bulgaria representatives organized the destruction of over 7 million counterfeit cigarettes bearing the mark L&M.; The destroyed cigarettes were part of over 14.5 million cigarettes seized by the Bulgarian customs officials in September 2010 and February 2011 at the border checkpoints Kulata and Ilinden, southwestern Bulgaria. Bulgaria‚Äôs Customs Agency and Philip Morris Bulgaria had signed a cooperation agreement aimed at fighting the illicit trade of tobacco products. L&M; cigarettes made 3 percent of all seized cigarettes in Bulgaria in 2010 and 9 percent of all seized cigarettes during the first five months of 2011. Sponsorship =Motorsports= L&M; was the sponsor for Carl Haas Racing from the 1970 Can-Am season to the 1971 Can-Am season. L&M; sponsored one of the Ducati bikes that Ben Bostrom drove in 2001 and 2002. The company also sponsored the Derbi factory team competing in the 2001 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season on the 125cc class. =Television shows= L&M;, as well as Kellogg's, were the main sponsors of the Hotel de Paree television show from October 2, 1959, until June 3, 1960.

Background  Since 2003, two major components in Arkansas public school districts must exist: * Each school district must have a high school, and * Each school district must have 350 students. The current consolidation policy that mandates operational changes for all districts with fewer than 350 students is the Public Education Reorganization Act‚ÄîAct 60 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2003. Geographical school districts in Arkansas are generally independent from city or county jurisdiction. Arkansas school district boundaries are not always aligned with county or city boundaries; a district can occupy several counties and cities, while a single city (especially larger ones such as Little Rock, Fort Smith, or Jonesboro) may be split between several districts. Almost all Arkansas school districts use the title \\"School District\\", or \\"Public Schools\\". All districts come under the jurisdiction of the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE).

He holds the dubious distinction as having played for, and managed, two of the worst teams in the history of Major League Baseball. A catcher who spent most of his 19-year (1910‚Äì1928) playing career in the minor leagues, he threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Meyer broke into the majors with the 1913 Chicago White Sox, but played only one game. Three years later, when he returned to the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1916, he appeared in 50 games for a squad that won only 36 games and lost 117. The following year, he played in 62 games for an A's club that improved but still posted a 55‚Äì98 mark. Then, a generation- and-a-half later, Meyer managed the 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates to the third-worst record in modern National League history, the Bucs winning only 42 of 154 games. However, during the period from 1932 through 1947, Meyer was a highly successful minor league manager, helming high-level teams in the New York Yankees' organization and winning four playoff championships. Early life  Meyer was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to William and Carrie Meyer. His father, born in the Grand Duchy of Baden in Germany, had emigrated to the United States at age 16 and operated a brewery in Knoxville. Meyer started playing baseball in grade school when his father bought him a catcher's mitt to catch his older brother. His hero was catcher Johnny Kling. He was a good student until high school, when baseball became such a primary focus that it even resulted in a school suspension. His father also owned a brewery in Smithton, Pennsylvania, for a time and the younger Meyer worked there during vacation. During his sophomore year of high school, Meyer was offered $75 per month to catch for a Lakeland, Florida, team, but he was expected to inherit the brewery so his father resisted the idea. He went regardless, and played so well that a Sanford, Florida, team offered him $175 per month to play for them. He caught for other Florida teams and finally hit a championship-winning home run for Gainesville, Florida. When he returned to Tennessee with $250, his father never protested against baseball again.Baseball Digest, 1948, by Vince Johnson from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Major league playing career In 1915, Meyer played so well for a Davenport, Iowa, team that Connie Mack signed him to back up catcher Wally Schang for his major league Philadelphia Athletics. He recalled that Mack had him catch for unpredictable young pitchers in order to save Schang. He played 50 games for the A's that year--and was thus on hand for a season in which the A's finished with the worst winning percentage in major league history. He played 62 games for the A's in 1917. As it turned out, this would be Meyer's last season in the majors as an active player. He collected 71 hits, with seven doubles, three triples and one home run, batted .236, and was credited with 21 runs batted in. After the season, Meyer was sold to the Louisville Colonels in the American Association. He would stay in Louisville for 11 years, and was a major contributor to the Colonels' American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 under Joe McCarthy. Minor league managerial career =Playing manager= When McCarthy was called up to manage the Chicago Cubs for the season, Meyer was named to succeed him at the Colonels' helm.The Pittsburgh Pirates Encyclopedia by David Finoli and Bill Ranier, 2003. In his first season, Louisville won a second consecutive pennant with a team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Billy Herman (whom Meyer would replace as skipper of the Pirates over 20 years later). But when the Colonels promptly slumped to consecutive 100-loss seasons in 1927 and 1928, he was fired. At the same time, he was released as a player. =New York Yankees' organization= After spending three years (1929‚Äì1931) as a coach for the Minneapolis Millers, an American Association rival of the Colonels, Meyer became manager of the 1932 Springfield Rifles of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the New York Yankees, where McCarthy was in his second season as manager. Meyer had the Rifles in first place on July 17 when the league folded due to Depression- related financial troubles. But only two days later, he was hired by the Binghamton Triplets of the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League, another Yankee farm team. Meyer stayed in Binghamton for 3 years, winning the pennant in 1933 and half the pennant in 1934 and 1935, and impressing George Weiss, head of the parent club's growing farm system. In 1936, Meyer moved up to the top-level Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, who then had a working agreement with the Bronx Bombers. He produced one playoff team in two seasons at Oakland and was named to manage another top-level Yankee farm outlet, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, in 1938. For the next ten years, Meyer alternated as the manager of the Blues (1938‚Äì1941; 1946‚Äì1947) and the Yankees' other elite farm club, the Newark Bears of the International League. During that time, he won four pennants and finished second four times. His 1939 Blues, who finished 107‚Äì47 and won the Junior World Series for the second year in a row, were named the 12th best team in history by Minor League Baseball. Meyer was named Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News.1939 Kansas City Blues at MiLB.com Overall, as a manager in the minors, Meyer won eight pennants, narrowly missed a ninth, and finished in the second division only twice. On July 6, 1944, Meyer and Newark were in last place, 30 games behind Bucky Harris and his Buffalo Bisons, and had lost to Buffalo seven consecutive times. Newark rebounded by winning 30 of 34 games while Buffalo dropped into the second division, and missed winning the pennant by a fraction of a percent. In 19 seasons as a minor league skipper, Meyer's clubs won 1,605 and lost 1,325 (.548). =Reputation= Meyer was known for scrappiness. With Newark, one of his players, Nick Rhabe, threatened the general manager, \\"If you don't get me more dough, you'll be sorry.\\" Rhabe carried through on the threat by running the bases poorly in a game. Meyer responded by knocking Rhabe down the dugout steps and kicking him off the team. In general, he was a disciplinarian who rarely screamed at players, similar to the style of Joe McCarthy. Meyer was an avid singer and a fan of George M. Cohan. While in New York, Joe McCarthy introduced Meyer to Cohan. Meyer impressed him by singing songs that Cohan himself had not remembered writing. =Bypassed for MLB jobs= During his minor league managerial career, Meyer was considered for major league jobs several times. He was a candidate to be manager for the 1938 Cleveland Indians, but lost out to Ossie Vitt. Later, he was derailed by clubs' preference of the time for player‚Äìmanagers, thus saving salary during the Great Depression, or men whose major league r√©sum√©s were stronger than Meyer's. When the Cubs fired Gabby Hartnett after the 1940 campaign Meyer was considered, but Jimmie Wilson got the job after helping the Cincinnati Reds win the 1940 World Series. In 1945, Frank E. McKinney, owner of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, approached Meyer at the Little World Series in Louisville on behalf of the Indians' parent team, the Boston Braves, about their managerial opening. But the Braves' owners, led by Lou Perini, ultimately chose Billy Southworth, winner of three straight NL pennants and two World Series titles from 1942‚Äì1944 with the St. Louis Cardinals; Southworth would be elected to the Hall of Fame as a manager in 2008. The parent Yankees, meanwhile, had only one skipper from 1931 through 1945: McCarthy, who won eight American League pennants, seven World Series titles, and 1,438 regular-season games (an average of 96 a season) during that span. Major league managerial career =Health issues= After a tumultuous 1946 season, which saw McCarthy quit as the Bombers' skipper in May, Yankees' president and co-owner Larry MacPhail offered the club's 1947 managerial job to Meyer. But Meyer had been seriously ill that same year; he had collapsed during a June game from heat prostration, and then was hospitalized for several weeks after suffering a mild heart attack. The hot- tempered, hard-drinking MacPhail also had a reputation for clashing with his managers. Meyer declined MacPhail's offer and instead returned to Kansas City, leading the 1947 Blues to a first-place finish, while the Yankees rebounded to win the 1947 pennant under Bucky Harris. =Pittsburgh Pirates= The years 1946 and 1947 were also consequential for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Frank McKinney‚Äîwho had contacted Meyer about interviewing with the Braves after the 1945 season‚Äîbecame the Pirates' majority owner in August 1946. His ownership group, which included entertainer Bing Crosby and real-estate magnate John W. Galbreath, hired a new management team at the close of the 1946 season. As general manager, they selected former Yankee farm system official Roy Hamey. Then they acquired Billy Herman from the Braves and named the future Hall of Fame second baseman player‚Äìmanager for 1947. But the managerial move backfired: the 37-year-old Herman was at the end of the line as a player, appearing in only 18 games and hitting .213, and his Pirates stumbled to the club's second consecutive seventh-place season in the eight-team National League. He resigned with one game left in the 1947 campaign. McKinney and Hamey, who had worked with Meyer at both Binghamton and Kansas City in the Yankee organization, then turned to Meyer, who accepted their offer to become Pittsburgh's pilot for 1948. Meyer received an important endorsement from Joe McCarthy, who had followed Meyer's work with future Yankees stars in Oakland, Kansas City and Newark closely. McCarthy was impressed enough to say Meyer had been the best manager in the minor leagues at the time, and predicted that he would be one of the best in the majors as well. In 1948, in his first season, Pittsburgh rose from seventh place to fourth in the standings‚Äîand just 8 games out of first. The 21-game improvement to 83‚Äì71 earned Meyer The Sporting News Major League Manager of the Year. The Pirates also led the National League in attendance.Baseball Reference: 1948 NL Attendance and Team Age Despite the home run heroics of Ralph Kiner, the Pirates dropped to sixth place in . Reportedly, Meyer lost the team when he suggested to reporters that a player had run into a pitchout on his own when he'd actually given the player a hit and run sign. By 1950 they were back in the cellar. In December 1950, the Pirate ownership replaced Hamey with Branch Rickey, whose solution was to purge the team of high-salaried veterans and bring up young players from the farm system‚Äîthe same tactic he'd used to rebuild the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers. However, it backfired disastrously in Pittsburgh, and Meyer was saddled with what amounted to a minor-league team at the major-league level. The Pirates managed to improve to seventh in 1951, but lost 112 games in 1952‚Äîthe second-worst record in franchise history, and the third-worst in modern (post-1900) National League history. Meyer resigned at the end of that campaign.Billy Meyer resigns as Pirates' manager Personal life Despite a managing record of 317‚Äì452 (.412) over five seasons, all with Pittsburgh, and his pedestrian big league playing career, Meyer was given two significant honors, a measure of how widely respected he was. In 1954, the Pirates retired Meyer's uniform number (1). He also was saluted by his native city of Knoxville, where he maintained his home and had married a classmate from grade school, Madelon Warters, in 1932. The city's baseball park, for years the home of the minor-league Knoxville Smokies, was named Bill Meyer Stadium in his honor. Meyer appears in the Norman Rockwell painting Bottom of the Sixth. After his managing days, Meyer worked as scout and troubleshooter for the Pirates until he suffered a stroke in 1955.Meyer is quitting game Meyer died two years later, in Knoxville, of heart and kidney ailments at age 64.Former Pittsburgh Manager Billy Meyer dies at 65 years References Further reading * Abrams, Al. \\"Sidelights on Sports: Passing of s Good One\\".

The spore-bearing sporangiophores of Phycomyces are very sensitive to different environmental signals including light, gravity, wind, chemicals and adjacent objects. They exhibit phototropic growth: most Phycomyces research has focused on sporangiophore photobiology, such as phototropism and photomecism ('light growth response'). Metabolic, developmental, and photoresponse mutants have been isolated, some of which have been genetically mapped. At least ten different genes (named madA through to madJ) are required for phototropism. The madA gene encodes a protein related to the White Collar 1 class of photoreceptors that are present in other fungi, while madB encodes a protein related to the White Collar 2 protein that physically bind to White collar 1 to participate in the responses to light. Phycomyces also exhibits an avoidance response, in which the growing sporangiophore avoids solid objects in its path, bending away from them without touching them, and then continuing to grow upward again. This is believed to result from an unidentified \\"avoidance gas\\" that is emitted by the growing zone of the sporangiophore. This gas would concentrate in the airspace between the Phycomyces and the object. This higher concentration would be detected by the side of the sporangiophore's growing zone, which would grow faster, causing the sporangiophore to bend away. Phycomyces blakesleeanus became the primary organism of research of the Nobel laureate Max Delbr√ºck starting in the 1950s, when Delbr√ºck decided to switch from research on bacteriophage and bacteria to P. blakesleeanus. A genetic linkage map was developed for P.blakesleeanus. This genetic map was constructed from 121 progeny of a cross between two wild type isolates and involved 134 markers. The markers were mostly PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Zygospores are the sexual structures of P. blakesleeanus in which the diploid zygote is formed and meiosis is presumed to take place. The data from this cross provided supporting evidence for meiosis during zygospore development.

Portrayed by veteran actress Barbara Knox, the character first appeared on-screen as Rita Littlewood for one episode on 2 December 1964, returning full-time to the series on 31 January 1972. Rita is the show‚Äôs second longest-serving character behind Ken Barlow (William Roache) who has been in the show since the first episode. Storylines Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) is taken with a young woman in The Rovers Return Inn and buys her a drink, only for Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to step in when he recognises her ‚Äì Rita Littlewood, a belly dancer who's appearing at the Viaduct Sporting Club. She can't find digs for the week and persuades a reluctant Dennis to let her sleep in his mother Elsie's (Pat Phoenix) bed while she's away. Dennis worries what people will say about Rita staying with him. Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) calls on Dennis about panto rehearsals and is shocked to see Rita in her nightie. The next morning, Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) wonders why Dennis is making up a breakfast tray. Dennis tells Rita of his disillusionment with showbusiness. Charlie Moffitt (Gordon Rollings) slips on the joists in the loft and puts his foot through the ceiling of Elsie's room. He apologises to the figure in the bed and realises it isn't Elsie. Dennis pays for the hole to be repaired when Charlie blackmails him over Rita in the bed. Elsie returns to the house, sees the hole and hears about Rita. It would be over seven years until Rita reappears. In January 1972, Rita returns to the Street as Rita Bates, living with Harry Bates (William Simons) as his common-law wife and his twelve-year- old son Terry (John Barrett). Initially attracted to Ken Barlow (William Roache), Rita later starts an on-off relationship with Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). Len arrives at Harry's house to return a scarf that Rita left in his van. They flirt. Len tells Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) and Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) to stay out of the house that evening as he‚Äôs entertaining a lady but to tidy up before they go. Ray delays going until Rita arrives so he can see who the woman is. Rita tells Len that her husband is away often working on building motorways. She obviously isn't happy in her marriage. Len tells her how much he likes her but Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) interrupts them. Rita is surprised to find out that Len is a councillor. Rita entertains Len after getting Terry out of the way. Alf tells Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) that Rita's house is due for demolition and Len is on the housing committee, hence the reason he thinks she's showing an interest in him. Rita tells Len she has to vacate by the end of the week. Len agrees to help her as she's on the housing list. Rita introduces Len to her husband Harry, convinced Len will get them a house. Len arranges an appointment with them and the housing committee. Rita and Harry are offered a flat but need a marriage certificate and they reveal to Len that they lied about being married, and Harry has a wife. Len refuses to pull strings for them and is annoyed at being lied to. Harry kicks Rita out and she dumps herself on Len. Rita refuses to return to Harry but Len refuses to have her at No.9. When Elsie refuses, Maggie Clegg (Irene Sutcliffe) takes Rita in. Maggie tells Rita she can stay as long as she has to but not a minute longer. Harry arrives back at the site. Len tells him that he's only interested in Rita's welfare. Terry fails to turn up at school and Ken lectures Rita about Terry's welfare. She tells him that she is not his mother and that she and Harry are not married. Rita tells Len she doesn't want to go back to Harry ‚Äì she wants him. Elsie tells Len that Rita is not his type. Two months later, Len gets tickets from Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) for the opening of the new Victoria Street Working Men's Club and invites Elsie and Alan Howard (Alan Browning). Len is shocked when Rita is introduced singing on stage, though Elsie thinks he knew all along that she'd be there. After her set, Len helps her when she is bothered by a drunk man. Len brings Rita to his table. Elsie is cold with her. Rita says she hasn't been with Harry Bates and his family for two months. Len wants to get to know Rita again. She agrees. From June 1972, the character is once again credited as Rita Littlewood. Rita turns up at The Rovers to see Len and tells him about Alec's offer. Rita auditions for Alec. Rita cooks for the lads at No.9. Ray and Jerry don't like her. Jerry doesn't like the idea of having Rita around. Rita gets a regular spot from Alec. Jerry tells Ray he thinks Rita is a gold- digger. Rather than be taken out for the night by Len, she makes a meat and potato pie for the lads and wins Jerry over. Len takes her home and next morning Ray and Jerry discover he hasn't come back but has spent the night with her. Len brings Rita to the opening of a new betting shop. Benny Lewis (Jeremy Young), the owner, talks Rita into an afternoon job as a hostess. Len thinks he's got designs on her. Rita refuses to clean for Benny. Benny asks Rita to join the staff permanently. Rita isn't sure and asks Len who tells her it's her decision. Rita still can't decide whether to take the job with Benny. Len books a meal out for the two of them. Benny also asks Rita to come round to his flat that night but she turns him down. Len tells Rita he can't take her out after all. Benny entertains Rita in his new luxury flat above the betting shop though few of the remote control things work properly. Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) finds them there together. Rita tells Benny she will work for him. Hilda gleefully gossips to Len that Rita is with Benny. Rita stands Benny up to go out with Len. Rita skives off work to be with Benny. Rita passes on an invite to Len for drinks at Benny's flat. Benny tries to get Rita to stay for a few drinks but she refuses as she has a date with Len. Rita and Len join Elsie and Alan for a drink in The Rovers before they go out and the ice begins to thaw between Elsie and Rita. Jerry advises Benny to tell Rita he's serious about her as Len doesn't want anything permanent. Benny questions Rita about Len's treatment of her. Rita tells Len that Benny is always asking questions about him as he's interested in her. Benny asks Len how serious he is about Rita. He tells him he isn't. Benny rings Rita and passes on what Len just said. She's hurt. Len tells Rita to choose between him and Benny. Benny asks Rita to marry him and she accepts him. Jerry tells Len that Rita isn't steady enough for him. Benny presents Rita with an expensive engagement ring. Jerry tells Benny that he was wrong and that Len has real feelings for Rita. Benny asks to see Len and tells him that he's not certain Rita wants to marry him and that she and Len are meant for each other. He wants Len to confess his feelings to Rita. Len tells Rita that Benny is backing out and leaving the field open for him. He confesses he needs her and Rita goes off with him, leaving a disappointed Benny behind. Lucille spreads the word that Rita's engagement to Benny is over. Len insists that Rita give Benny his ring back. The residents get the wrong idea and think that Len is marrying Rita. Rita tells Len that she tried to give the ring back to Benny but he told her to keep it. Rita tells Len that her landlady Lena Norris has told her that she can't have men visitors after 9 pm. Jerry warns Len that Rita has given up a lot for him and hasn't gotten much back. Len gets rid of Jerry to entertain Rita at No.9. Jerry interrupts Len and Rita just as they get amorous on the sofa. Having got rid of Jerry, Len and Rita start cuddling on the sofa. Ray interrupts them to borrow money off Len to take Mandy Taylor (Sarah Twist) out. Jerry gatecrashes Len and Rita's night again to collect his pen and notepad. He is soon followed by Ray, who abandoned his date as he found Mandy too hard to keep up with. Len pays him to go to the Rovers. Len sets up a rota so he can have time alone with Rita at No.9. Ray and Jerry are miffed that they each get one evening a week while Len gets two. Benny realises nearly ¬£5,000 has been stolen. In his time of need, he calls on Rita before informing the police. Det Insp Patterson (Tony Steedman) investigates the burglary and interviews Rita and Benny about the routine of banking the money and who had the keys to the flat. Benny tells Ray and Len that Patterson thinks the keys they and Rita had were used in the robbery. Benny sacks Len. Rita takes him to task for it. Rita tells Len he won't have time to run the yard and be a councillor. She makes him buy Ray and Jerry a drink. Rita tells a worried Elsie about the night club deal. Benny feels life is looking up with the new business venture. He gets Rita to support him in a meeting to discuss terms with Jimmy Frazer (John Barrie) and Alan. Jimmy, Alan, and Elsie join Rita and Benny. Jimmy and Benny agree to be equal partners in the new club venture with Alan looking after Jimmy's interests in his absence. Rita decides to take the job of hostess at the Club, keeping on the Betting Shop as well. Mayor Harold Chapman (Frank Crompton) tells Len he's in for a chance of being the next Mayor of Weatherfield and tells him to look out for a suitable Mayoress, insinuating that Rita doesn't cut the mustard. Len asks Benny to drop Rita from The Capricorn. He refuses. Alan, Benny, and Rita hold auditions for dolly birds, hostesses and strippers at Benny's flat as the decorators are still at the club. Len asks Rita to drop the idea of being hostess. She wonders why he's changed his mind. Billy Walker (Ken Farrington) and Rita embarrass Len in front of Mayor Alderman Chapman at the opening of The Capricorn. Rita gets into a fight with a drunken woman and ends up on Chapman's lap, all to the delight of Alf and Alderman Rogers. Alf tells Rita that Len is up for Mayor of Weatherfield. Rita rows with Len in the Rovers when he accuses her of being too common. She pours a drink over him and walks out. Len pushes for Alan to fix his van and tells Alf he and Rita have split up. Rita notices how much Alan is drinking at the club. Rita worries that Alan is drinking too much. Elsie becomes suspicious of Alan's involvement with Rita. Rita carries Alan home in the early hours. She takes his keys and gives them to Billy in the morning. Elsie gives the keys back to Alan, viciously, wondering what he was doing with Rita. Alan tries to make Elsie see there's nothing between him and Rita. Alan refuses to give Hilda a sub as Rita isn't happy with her work. Hilda insinuates that Alan is seeing Rita and is sacked by Alan. Hilda tells Elsie she was sacked because she knew too much about Alan and Rita. Elsie decides to ask Rita what's going on. Rita tells Elsie there's nothing between Alan and her ‚Äì it's the booze she's got to worry about. On Christmas Day, 1972, the residents gather in the select of the Rovers for the 1940s show as Rita plays Marlene Dietrich. Len is appointed Deputy Mayor. Rita avoids Len. He gives her an invitation via Jerry for a private drink. Jerry tries to speak to Rita about Len but Hilda interrupts. Len worries that Rita will think he's only interested in her now that he knows he won't be Mayor. Elsie speaks to Rita on his behalf but she's afraid that she'll be thrown to one side again as Len thinks she's not good enough, even though she needs him and knows he needs her. Elsie pushes Len to keep on pursuing Rita. Ray thinks Len is better off without Rita. Rita agrees to go to the pictures with Ray, annoying Len when Elsie tells him. Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) asks Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Rita and Norma Ford (Diana Davies) how Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) has been behaving while she's been away. A worried Ray asks Rita to explain to Len that there's nothing between them but she refuses. Rita allows Len to buy her a drink. Rita introduces Len to her \\"manager\\" Johnny Mann (Charles Pemberton). Rita takes a job singing in a nightclub, and when Len Fairclough purchases a failing newsagents, he installs Rita as manageress of The Kabin, a corner shop which also serves light food, with Mavis Riley as her assistant. She becomes Rita Fairclough when she and Len marry in April 1977. The marriage runs into trouble in early 1980, when sick of being taken for granted and living in what she describes as squalor, Rita leaves Len and thanks to Ralph Lancaster's help, attempts to regain her cabaret career. After a physical altercation with Len, she flees to Blackpool, where Len tracks her down after several months and she agrees to return to Coronation Street, but only if Len renovates their home and changes his ways. In the summer of 1981, Rita and Len are rejected for being adoptive parents due to their age, (Rita told the agency she is aged 40, despite actress Knox being 48 at the time), but begin fostering children, enjoying their first foster son, John, despite the challenges. In March 1982, they take in foster daughter Sharon Gaskell (Tracie Bennett), who becomes part of their family. After Len builds a new home on the vacant lot of No. 7, the Faircloughs and Sharon move into the new home, but Sharon eventually moves away. Len is killed in a car accident in December 1983 and Rita is devastated to learn he had been having an affair. Sharon returns to comfort Rita, but when she attempts to break up Gail & Brian Tilsley's marriage, Rita throws Sharon out and she is not seen again until 1999. In January 1986, Rita takes in another foster daughter, Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), and meets her estranged father Alan (Mark Eden). She begins a relationship with him, unaware he is also seeing Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins), a barmaid at The Rovers. When Rita discovers his infidelity, she insists he choose and although Alan chooses Gloria, Gloria doesn't feel the same and ends their affair. Rita allows Alan to move in to her home and he proposes marriage several times, even going as far as to arrange their wedding as a surprise to Rita, but she refuses to participate when she arrives at the registry office thinking she's a guest at another wedding. Alan is also a conman and after using Rita's capital to fund his own business enterprises, he poses as Len to the bank and re-mortgages Rita's house to start a security business when she refuses any more cash. He hires Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) as a receptionist and tries to rape her. Rita learns about the attack and Alan's fraudulent activities and reports him to the building society. In March 1989, in retaliation, he tries to suffocate her but fails and is found not guilty of attempted murder. He starts stalking Rita, who has a breakdown and escapes to Blackpool, but in December 1989 Alan tracks her down and tries to make her return to Weatherfield, but he is run down by a tram and killed in the attempt. In 1992, she becomes Rita Sullivan when she marries Ted Sullivan (William Russell). The marriage only lasts three months, as he dies from a brain tumour. When Rita collapses in her flat in July 1998 from carbon monoxide poisoning, she is saved by Alec. Realising how close he came to losing his best friend, Alec proposes to Rita. She initially turns him down, but later changes her mind and accepts. Their relationship ends several months later when they realise they cannot trust one another. Rita takes in Stacey, a local woman who tried to con Fred Elliott (John Savident) by pretending to be a Thai bride named Orchid. She had previously conned a man named Stuart (Duncan Preston), who locked her in his flat for days at a time and inflicted physical violence on her. Stuart traces her to Rita's home and breaks in, destroying her property. He threatens Rita, and though he is arrested, Rita decides to move house. Rita later moves in with her old friend Doreen Fenwick (Barbara Young), and although they initially get along well, Doreen outstays her welcome. Rita is proposed to by her friend and co-worker Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), she turns him down. In December 2010, Rita is trapped in the wreckage from the 50th anniversary tram crash when the tram smashes into the side of The Kabin. Everyone thought she had gone out for dinner with an old friend, therefore nobody knew she was in the wreckage until Nick Tilsey (Ben Price) informs Norris, Emily and Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) that he saw Rita before the tram crash and that she said to him that her friend cancelled on her, thus worrying Norris, Mary, and Emily. They inform the fire crew and Rita is found. Rita survives with cuts and bruises. She is traumatised by this, with proof taking place when The Rovers burns down in 2013, Rita is flustered at the thought of the tram crash. Rita invites Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to live with her when she is made homeless. Rita is shocked when she bumps into her old friend Dennis. As he has since fallen on hard times and is living as a homeless person, he is highly embarrassed when Rita recognises him, and he runs off. She later approaches Dennis Tanner at the soup kitchen and takes him to the Rovers to meet old friends Ken and Emily. Rita develops feelings for Dennis and tells Tina. Dennis feels guilty about living off Rita, and she supports him in his attempts to find a job but becomes depressed when he gets a job in Birmingham. Rita tells Tina that she loves Dennis and Tina reveals that he feels the same about her. When Rita returns home, she finds Dennis waiting for her. They declare their love for each other and Dennis proposes. On her wedding day in June 2012, Rita is kidnapped by loan shark, Rick Neelan (Greg Wood). He threatens to throw her into the canal if Tina does not give him a bag of drugs, which she had seized earlier in the day. Tina hands over the bag and the police arrive to arrest Rick. Rita is taken to the registry office and she marries Dennis. Rita is not very happy when Dennis decides he wants to be in the music industry again, so he contacts his old friend Ritchie de Vries (Robin Askwith). She feels insecure when Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) also decides to tag along with the whole idea, and becomes very close with Dennis, and the pair begin flirting. Rita begins a rivalry with Gloria, and when Dennis tries to look young again, Rita isn't very pleased. When they are in The Rovers, Dennis calls Rita \\"old\\", telling her that Gloria is ten years younger than her. Rita subsequently throws Dennis out of their house, so he sleeps at Gloria's house on the sofa. The next day, Rita has finally forgiven Dennis for his horrible insult, but when they are in the Bistro having a Valentine's Day meal, Gloria can't help but intervene and tells Rita that Dennis slept at her house the night before. Rita is furious and throws Dennis out again. Just as it seems that Rita and Dennis will live happily ever after, when Gloria announces she is leaving, Dennis decides to leave with Gloria at the last minute. He waves goodbye to Rita from Gloria's car as they drive out of the street and laughs. Rita looks hurt and embarrassed in front of her friends. Dennis and Gloria don't last long and he returns to the streets when she finishes with him, this results in him having a trip to hospital which Rita finds out about. On visiting Dennis in hospital, Rita tells him that she cannot forgive him for what he has done but offers him her sofa until he can sort himself out. Sometime after living together, Dennis begs Rita to take him back, but she declines, advising him that their marriage is over for good and the sooner he goes the better. In late 2016 Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) comes to live with Rita but clashes with Jenny who Rita recently came back into contact with. In 2017, Rita starts becoming forgetful, starting when she forgets she bought Gemma a mug. She later accuses Gemma of stealing money that she lent to Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde), which results in Gemma and Rita falling out. They later make up but Rita's forgetfulness starts to get more frequent. She lays a place at the table for Len. Gemma confides in Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan). When Rita writes a number of cheques for Jenny and her fianc√©, Johnny Connor, (Richard Hawley)'s wedding, Gemma tries to prove to her that there's something wrong with her. Rita refuses to believe Gemma, before she collapses. She is taken to hospital, where a specialist diagnoses her with a brain tumour. She later has the tumour removed. Colin Callen (Jim Moir) tells Rita he wants to buy the Kabin. Rita and Gemma later celebrate with their friends when they find out that Rita's tumour was benign. Casting Prior to 2006, Knox was reportedly the highest-paid actress with the show, until Anne Kirkbride began to earn more. Knox's salary is ¬£260,000 a year which producers pay to keep her in a secure future with the series. In January 2009, it was speculated that Knox and other veteran actors were going to be axed from the show in a bid to save money but this was later denied by a Coronation Street spokesperson. Knox was temporarily written out of the series in August 2009 for health reasons. She returned to the show on 15 March 2010. In April 2010 a spokesperson for Coronation Street announced that Knox has a job for life on the show and that she will continue to play her character Rita for as long as she wants to be there. Development The producers of the show decided to pair Rita with Mavis Riley portrayed by Thelma Barlow by giving Mavis a job in Rita's corner shop; the characters' relationship has been described as a chalk and cheese comedy partnership. Christine Geraghty has cited Rita and Mavis' friendship as an example of a soap opera portraying an important, stable, intimate female relationship: \\"Rita is Mavis's boss, but she is also one of her closest friends\\". In September 2009, Knox took a break from the show due to ill health and returned on 15 March 2010. Her character was said to be on a world cruise with friend Doreen Fenwick, after selling her share of The Kabin to Norris Cole. In May 2011, a Daily Mirror reporter announced that Rita and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) would become love rivals, following Dennis Tanner's (Philip Lowrie) return. Lowrie hinted at a possible relationship between Dennis and Rita, saying \\"I asked Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, how many husbands has she had? She said three, so there might be a fourth, you never know!\\" Rita and Dennis begin a relationship and series producer Phil Collinson stated \\"Rita genuinely loves Dennis very much. Their storyline harks back to 1964, when he looked after her and took her in. Now he's grown to love her because she's been able to look after him. I like that we can tell a love story of people in their 70s, and it's a relationship that we're really committed to. I'd love for Rita to have a wedding, so watch this space! And if we did have one, she'd be Mrs Tanner ‚Äì how great is that?\\" Collinson later revealed Rita and Dennis would get married and their wedding would coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. In August 2017, the character was involved in a storyline which saw her diagnosed with a brain tumour. Many of the show's fans were devastated by the idea that such a beloved and iconic character might be killed off. The storyline received a lot of media attention and criticism from the viewers, as it began shortly after the death of Ashley Thomas, a character from fellow ITV programme Emmerdale, who had a seemingly similar diagnosis. Within days of the storyline being introduced a \\"Save Rita\\" campaign was set up online and attracted over 500 signatures. A spokesperson for Coronation Street later denied that the character was going to die, and confirmed that Knox remains very much part of the show. In December 2019, it was reported by The Sun that Rita would feature in a big storyline over Christmas. Producer Ian Macleod relished the chance to give Barbara Knox the spotlight after all of these decades in Weatherfield. \\"It's a really good story actually and Barbara Knox, as is always the case, if you give her something big to do she nails it,\\" he said. \\"I'm not saying that with any hint of surprise in my voice, she's been doing it for decades. She's so good at it and it's a great story. She's embraced it with the gusto you'd expect from someone who's been doing it for so long.\\" Reception Knox won the 1989 TV Times Award for \\"Best Actress\\". At The British Soap Awards 2004, she was presented with a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" for her portrayal of Rita. The 2006 ceremony saw Knox and Malcolm Hebden, who plays Norris, win the award for \\"Best On-Screen Partnership.\\" Knox was nominated for \\"Best Serial Drama Performance\\" at the National Television Awards 2018, losing out to her Coronation Street co-star, Lucy Fallon, who portrays Bethany Platt. She is a fan favourite amongst the viewers (in 2010 she was voted the 5th best character of all time).

The Bangor Daily News was founded on June 18, 1889; it merged with the Bangor Whig and Courier in 1900. Also known as the News or the BDN, the paper is published by Bangor Publishing Company, a local family-owned company. It has been owned by the Towle-Warren family for four generations; current publisher Richard J. Warren is the great-grandson of J. Norman Towle, who bought the paper in 1895. Since 2018, it has been the only independently owned daily newspaper in the state. History As part of its community relations, the Bangor Daily News in 1950 sponsored a soap box derby car, which bore the newspaper's logo. The car is on display at the Cole Land Transportation Museum in Bangor. The Bangor Daily Newss first issue was June 18, 1889; the main stockholder in the publishing company was Bangor shipping and logging businessman Thomas J. Stewart. Upon Stewart's death in 1890, his sons took control of the paper, which was originally a tabloid with \\"some news, but also plenty of gossip, lurid stories and scandals.\\" In 1895, J. Norman Towle purchased the newspaper. Ownership of the paper remained in the family, and Towle's great-grandson Richard J. Warren remains the publisher today. The Bangor Daily News merged with the Bangor Whig & Courier in 1900, leaving two newspapers in the city: BDN and the Bangor Daily Commercial (which ceased publication in 1949). Towle's son-in-law Fred Jordan took control of the paper in 1929. Forty-six BDN staff members served in the U.S. forces during World War II, and the paper's managing editor John M. O‚ÄôConnell was sent to Europe as a war correspondent. After Fred Jordan's death in 1947, his widow Lillis Towle Jordan became publisher. Richard K. Warren became publisher in 1955 and remained in that role until 1984, a time when the newspaper's circulation dramatically increased. It has only missed one day of delivery in its entire history. On New Year's Eve 1962, a massive blizzard dumped over three feet of snow on Bangor, with 20-foot snowdrifts that made it impossible for the delivery trucks to move. The newspaper's peak came in the mid-1980s, when Bangor Daily News had 150 reporters and editors and 150 other employees. At the time, published seven regional editions of the newspaper throughout Maine, and in addition to its main office on Main Street in Bangor had news bureaus at Madawaska, Presque Isle, Houlton, Pittsfield, Calais, Machias, Rockland, Augusta and Ellsworth. In 1982, a reporter for the Bangor Daily News, Beurmond Banville, who ran a one-person news bureau for the paper in Madawaska, Maine, on the U.S.-Canada border, wrote about a pretrial hearing in a murder case in New Brunswick, Canada.Jonathan Friendly, Maine Newspaper Tests Canadian Court Curb, New York Times (March 4, 1982). After publishing an account of the restricted proceeding in BDN, Banville was convicted in a Canadian court for violating a publication ban, and was fined $160; in 1983, the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick upheld the conviction, but gave Banville an absolute discharge, meaning that he does not have any Canadian criminal record.Reporter's Conviction Upheld, Reuters (January 19, 1983). Banville and the newspaper considered the Canadian court's ruling to be a prior restraint on freedom of the press, but decided not to further appeal considering the cost. The ruling appears in a textbook on Canadian media law. Robert Martin & Stuart Adam, Sourcebook of Canadian Media Law (2d. ed: Carlton University Press, 1994), pp. 335-41. Richard J. Warren succeeded his father as editor in 1984; five years later, the newspaper moved its printing plant from Bangor to a new printing plant in Hampden (which was closed in 2013 and sold in 2015). The newspaper was an early adopter of a policy against running tobacco advertising. As of 1993, the Bangor Daily News was one of fewer than twenty American newspapers that declined to accept ads for tobacco products.William Glaberson, Seattle Times Places a Ban on Tobacco Advertisements, New York Times (July 5, 1993). The newspaper launched its Web presence in 1997 at bangornews.com, later moving to bangordailynews.com in the 2000s. From 1997 to 2001, BDN acted as an Internet service provider in addition to a newspaper, working with two local, small telecommunications companies to provide dial-up Internet access to a few thousand people in Maine. BDN adopted an aggressive \\"digital-first\\" publishing strategy, and became the most-read online news source in the state; in 2011, the Portland Press Herald outsold BDN in print copies by a few thousand papers on an average weekday, but BDNs website had more than 100,000 unique visitors than the Press Heralds website. In 2008, the paper's editorial page director, Todd Benoit, was appointed BDNs director of new media; he later became BDNs president and chief operating officer. In 2014, Richard J. Warren became publisher of the newspaper. The company that owns and operates the newspaper, Bangor Publishing Co., expanded through acquisitions of Bangor Metro magazine (2014), Madawaska's St. John Valley Times (2015), and Fort Kent's Fiddlehead Focus (2016). The company also owns several weekly newspapers in Maine: the Presque Isle Star-Herald, Caribou Aroostook Republican and News, Dover-Foxcroft Piscataquis Observer, Houlton Pioneer Times, and Greater Bangor The Weekly. In 2011 and 2012, BDN established the partnerships The Maine Campus (the independent student newspaper at the University of Maine) and The Free Press (the student newspaper at the University of Southern Maine) through the BDN media partners program. The program involves a content-sharing agreement as well as training and Web hosting services provided by BDN to the student newspapers.BDN launches partnership with The Maine Campus newspaper, Bangor Daily News (December 9, 2011).The Free Press teams up with the Bangor Daily News, Free Press (April 9, 2013). In 2011, BDN hired an additional reporter to cover Greater Portland and reassigned another reporter to cover the southern mid- coast of Maine. Editor-in-chief Mike Dowd also named editorial-page editor Susan Young as \\"managing editor for investigative reporting and new initiatives\\" and appointed Tom Groening as editorial-page editor. The Bangor Daily News and The Quoddy Tides sought records under the Maine Freedom of Access Act of closed-door tribal councils of the Passamaquoddy Tribe relating to a proposed $500 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on tribal land at the Pleasant Point Reservation.Maine Court Rejects Newspapers' Bid for Tribal Records, Editor & Publisher (May 9, 2006). A Maine court decided that the newspapers were not entitled to the records because the tribal officials' negotiations with the Oklahoma-based LNG developer were undertaken in the reservation's capacity as \\"a profit-making business rather than municipal governance\\" and were therefore not subjected to the Freedom of Access Act. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court unanimously affirmed the ruling in 2006. In 2013, Bangor Daily News reporters submitted a public records request to Maine's state government for public information that included the names and addresses of the holders of concealed-weapon permits. The request, made in furtherance of newsgathering, prompted a fierce uproar, and the newspaper dropped the request.Maine: Uproar Over Request for Gun Permit Data, Reuters (February 15, 2013). In 2018, Bangor Daily News became the state's only independently owned daily newspaper in the state, after MaineToday Media, owned by Reade Brower, acquired additional newspapers in Maine. MaineToday now owns the seven of Maine's eight daily newspapers: the Portland Press Herald and Maine Sunday Telegram, the Times Record of Brunswick, the Journal Tribune of Biddeford, the Kennebec Journal in Augusta, the Morning Sentinel in Waterville, and the Coastal Journal in Bath. Although Brower's company does not own BDN, it does provide printing services for BDN.Casey Kelly, The man behind Maine's unparalleled consolidation of local news, Columbia Journalism Review (September 6, 2018). As of 2020, about half of BDNs journalists were based in Bangor, with the other half spread across Maine. Editorial stance The Bangor Daily Newss editorial stance has traditionally leaned toward conservatism and the Republican Party, in contrast to the Portland Press Herald, which was regarded as having a more liberal, pro-Democratic editorial stance.Christian P. Potholm, This Splendid Game: Maine Campaigns and Elections, 1940-2002 (Lexington Books: 2004), p. 9. It historically endorsed Republican candidates for office,Richard J.

After graduation from the Imperial Latin School in Landstuhl (today: Sickingen- Gymnasium Landstuhl), he first studied Forestry in Aschaffenburg, then Law until 1893 in Munich and Erlangen. Subsequently, he settled down as a lawyer, at first in Dachau, later in Munich. After 1899, he worked for the magazine Simplicissimus and published humorous narrations, comedies, novels and stories. Thoma satirized Bavarian rural and small-town life. His serious peasant novels Andreas V√∂st (1905), Der Wittiber (1911), and Der Ruepp (1922), as well as his humorous collections Assessor Karlchen (1900), Lausbubengeschichten (Scoundrel Stories, 1904), and Tante Frieda (Aunt Frieda, 1906), are characterized by authenticity of regional language and life. Thoma's dramas, including Die Medaille (The Medal, 1901), Das S√§uglingsheim (The Orphanage, 1913), and especially Moral (1908), reflect elements of folk theater. In 1907 he married 25-year-old Marietta di Rigardo, who was born in the Philippines. The marriage, however, did not last; Marietta was soon bored and by 1911 Thoma and Marietta were divorced.

Geography  K√∂nigswinter is situated on the right bank of the Rhine, opposite Bad Godesberg, at the foot of the Siebengebirge. It covers an area of 76.19 square kilometres which makes it the fourth-largest conurbation in the Rhein-Sieg district. It contains over 80 townships and boroughs, divided over the municipal districts of Stieldorf, Niederdollendorf, Oberdollendorf, Heisterbacherrott, Ittenbach, Oberpleis, Eudenbach, Thomasberg and K√∂nigswinter proper.  Main sights  = Drachenfels = The Drachenfels, crowned by the ruins of a castle built in the early 12th century by the archbishop of Cologne, rises behind the town. From the summit, which can be accessed by the Drachenfels Railway, there is a view celebrated by Lord Byron in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. A cave in the hill is said to have sheltered the dragon () which was slain by the hero Siegfried. The mountain is quarried, and from 1267 onward supplied stone (trachyte) for the building of Cologne Cathedral. The Schloss Drachenburg, built in 1883, is on the north side of the hill. = Petersberg and Heisterbach = The Petersberg mountain also overlooks K√∂nigswinter. This was formerly the home of an Augustinian and, later, Cistercian monastery. Around 1195 the monks moved to the foot of the mountain and founded the Abbey of Heisterbach, which was destroyed in 1803. The ruins can still be seen. Today the peak of the Petersberg is occupied by the Hotel Petersberg, a grand hotel which serves as a guest house for the German Government. Many world leaders have stayed there, and conferences are regularly held. Like the Drachenfels, the Petersberg was once served by its own railway, the Petersberg Railway, but this closed in 1958 and the hotel is now reached by road or helicopter. = The town = K√∂nigswinter has a Catholic (St Remigius) and a Protestant church, some small manufactures and a little shipping. It has a monument to the poet Wolfgang M√ºller.  Transport  Bonn tram 7577 at K√∂nigswinter The town is served by K√∂nigswinter and Niederdollendorf stations on the Rhine East Bank Railway between Cologne and Wiesbaden, as well as by several stops on line 66 of the Bonn Stadtbahn, which takes a different route through the town. The tourist- oriented Drachenfels Railway does not connect direct with either of these lines but instead relies on a steam-outline road train for connection to the town centre and stations. Several ferries cross the Rhine between K√∂nigswinter and the west bank.

Dr. John Milton Hoberman is a Professor of Germanic languages within the Department of Germanic Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.

He is a European cultural and intellectual historian, who has interests in Sportwissenschaft and the history of racial ideas.

Testosterone Dreams His most recent book, Testosterone Dreams, is a history of the use of hormone treatments for lifestyle and performance enhancement during the last century, in the context of an analysis of modern society's ever-increasing use of chemical enhancements in general and its effect on human self-image. It focuses in particular on the early commercial marketing of the hormone testosterone, which is considered representative of all the performance-enhancing drugs that followed it. =Book excerpts= > \\"Testosterone dreams are the fantasies of hormonal rejuvenation, sexual > excitement, and supernormal human performance that have been inspired by > testosterone since it was first synthesized in 1935.\\" > \\"Within a generation, sports audiences around the world were enjoying > record-breaking performances achieved by athletes whose \\"productive power\\" > was boosted by testosterone-based anabolic steroids.

Accusations of racism and ethnocentrism were leveled at him; however, actual excerpts from the book seemed to show his extreme opposition to racism, and in later materials (see \\"How Not to Misread Darwin‚Äôs Athletes\\") he acknowledged his unfortunate na√Øvet√© regarding how a white author would be perceived when writing on such a topic. Overall, the scholarly and critical reactions to the book were largely positive. =Book excerpts= > \\"[T]he presence of large numbers of black athletes in the major sports > appears to have persuaded almost everyone that the process of integration > has been a success.

McGavran identified differences of caste and economic social position as major barriers to the spread of Christianity. His work substantially changed the methods by which missionaries identify and prioritize groups of persons for missionary work and stimulated the Church Growth Movement. McGavran developed his church growth principles after rejecting the popular view that mission was ‚Äòphilanthropy, education, medicine, famine relief, evangelism, and world friendship‚Äô and become convinced that good deeds ‚Äì while necessary ‚Äì ‚Äòmust never replace the essential task of mission, discipling the peoples of the earth‚Äô. Early life and education McGavran was born in Damoh, India, in 1897. Following his father and grandfather, McGavran became the third generation of missionaries in his family. He received his early education in Central Provinces, India. After his family returned to the United States, he went to school in Tulsa, OK and Indianapolis, IN. He attended Butler University (B.A., 1920), Yale Divinity School (B.D., 1922), the former College of Mission, Indianapolis (M.A., 1923), and, following two terms in India, Columbia University (Ph.D., 1936). Missionary career Through the influence of John R. Mott and the Student Volunteer Movement, McGavran went to India as a missionary in 1923, working primarily as an educator under appointment with the United Christian Missionary Society of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In 1927 he became director of religious education for his mission, before returning to the United States to work on his Ph.D. at Columbia University. After his return to India, he was elected field secretary in 1932 and placed in charge of administering the denomination‚Äôs entire India mission. During his time in India, McGavran was deeply influenced by J. Waskom Pickett, once saying: \\"I lit my candle at Pickett‚Äôs fire.\\" In 1928 Pickett was asked by the National Christian Council of India, Burma, and Ceylon to make an extensive study of the phenomenon in India of \\"Christian mass movements,\\" that is, mass conversion of certain sectors of Indian society. McGavran read Pickett‚Äôs book and recommended to his mission headquarters in Indianapolis that they employ the services of Pickett to study why similar mass movements to Christ were not happening in their ministry area of mid-India. As supervisor of eighty missionaries and various medical and educational institutions, McGavran had become concerned that after several decades of work his mission had only about thirty small churches, all of which were experiencing little growth. At the same time, he saw \\"people movements\\" in scattered areas of India where thousands of people in groups, rather than as individuals, were becoming Christians. McGavran assisted Pickett in the study and became the chief architect of the study in Madhya Pradesh. In 1937 McGavran wrote a book called Founders of the India Church in which he turned the spotlight on humble Indians who began people movements. McGavran discovered that of the 145 areas where mission activity was taking place, 134 had grown only eleven percent between 1921 and 1931. The churches in those areas were not even conserving their own children in the faith. Yet, in the other eleven areas the church was growing by one hundred percent, one hundred fifty percent, and even two hundred percent a decade. He wondered why some churches were growing, while others, often just a few miles away, were not. During this same time period, McGavran was quietly changing his view of mission and theology. In the formative years of his childhood, mission was held to be carrying out the Great Commission, winning the world for Christ, and saving lost humanity. This was the view McGavran held when he returned to the United States for his higher education. While attending Yale Divinity School, McGavran was introduced to the teachings of the influential Christian professor H. Richard Niebuhr. According to McGavran, Niebuhr \\"used to say that mission was everything the church does outside its four walls. It was philanthropy, education, medicine, famine relief, evangelism, and world friendship.\\" McGavran espoused this view of mission when he went to the mission field in 1923. As he became involved in education, social work, and evangelism in India, he gradually reverted to his earlier position that mission was about making disciples of Jesus Christ. When McGavran's three-year term as mission secretary was up in 1936, he was not reelected. According to McGavran, in effect the mission said to him, ‚ÄúSince you are talking so much about evangelism and church growth, we are going to locate you in a district where you can practice what you preach‚Äù. McGavran accepted his new appointment and spent the next seventeen years trying to start a people movement among the Satnamis caste. About one thousand people were won to Christ, fifteen small village churches were planted, and the Gospels were translated into Chhattisgarhi.  Church Growth  In 1958, McGavran resigned from his mission work and proposed to a number of American seminaries the possibility of starting a department focused on the subject of church growth. It was not until 1961 when Institute of Church Growth was established at Northwest Christian College in Eugene, Oregon. Eventually in 1965, David Allan Hubbard invited McGavran to become the first dean of School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. Based on his lectures in Eugene and later at Fuller, McGavran published the book Understanding Church Growth (1970). In the work, McGavran articulated a key feature of his church growth theory, known as the \\"homogenous unit principle.\\" Drawing from his experiences in India of mass movements, the homogenous unit principle reasoned that individuals are more likely to convert to Christianity en masse when they share similar demographics.

As such, they are distinguished from the Sacraments of healing (Anointing of the sick and Sacrament of Penance) and from the Sacraments of Service (Marriage and Ordination). Eastern and Western approaches In the Eastern Church all three sacraments are usually administered at the same time, even in the case of infants. In the Latin Church and other Western denominations, the rite of infant baptism was developed for use with babies. In these traditions the Eucharist and Confirmation are postponed until the child achieves the age of self-awareness. Adults are normally baptized after enrollment as a catechumen, either formally, as in the Latin Rite, or more informally, as in some Eastern Catholic Churches. In his apostolic constitution Divinae consortium naturae on the sacrament of Confirmation,Divinae consortium naturae Pope Paul VI declared: \\"The sharing in the divine nature given to men through the grace of Christ bears a certain likeness to the origin, development, and nourishing of natural life. The faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation, and receive in the Eucharist the food of eternal life.\\"Translation in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1212 Celebration According to Roman Catholic theology, the way the sacraments of initiation are celebrated is meant to bring a neophyte to experience and know, through visible sacramental signs and gestures, eternal life and grace Jesus has brought into this world. They are always accompanied by the Word of God.Liam G. Walsh (1988) The Sacraments of Christian Initiation, p. 1 Particular focus is placed on the paschal mystery of Christ's death and resurrection.

Kraft Prinz zu Hohenlohe- Ingelfingen (2 January 1827 - 16 January 1892), was a Prussian general and military writer during the time of the German Empire.  Early life  Kraft Karl August zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen was born at Koschentin in Upper Silesia. He was the son of Prince Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1797‚Äì1873), and a grandson of Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen (1746‚Äì1818), who commanded the Prussians at Jena. Educated with great rigour, owing to the impoverishment of the family estates during the Napoleonic Wars, Kraft was sent into the Prussian army. There, he was commissioned to the artillery as the least expensive arm of the service. He joined the Prussian Guard artillery in 1845, and it was soon discovered that he had unusual aptitudes as an artillery officer. For a time his fellow officers resented the presence of a prince, until it was found that he made no attempt to use his social position to secure advancement.  Promotions  After serving as a military attach√© in Vienna and on the Transylvanian frontier during the Crimean War, Kraft was made a captain on the general staff, and in 1856 personal aide-de-camp to the king, remaining, however, in close touch with the artillery. In 1864, having become major and then lieutenant colonel, he resigned the staff appointments to become commander of the new Guard Field Artillery regiment. In the following year, he became colonel. Kraft saw his first real active service in 1866. In the hold advance of the Guard corps on the Austrian right wing at K√∂niggr√§tz during the Austro-Prussian War, he led the Guard reserve artillery with success, and after the short war ended he turned his energies, now fortified by experience, to the tactical training of the Prussian artillery. Prince Kraft's grave in Johannisfriedhof in Dresden. In 1868 Kraft was made a major-general and assigned to command the Guard artillery brigade. In this capacity he gained great distinction during the Franco-Prussian War, especially at Gravelotte and Sedan. He was in control of the artillery attack on the fortifications of Paris. In 1873 he was placed in command of an infantry division, and three years later was promoted to lieutenant-general. While he retired in 1879, he was made general of infantry in 1883 and then general of artillery in 1889.  Writings  Kraft's military writings were numerous, and amongst them several have become classics. These are Briefe √ºber Artillerie (English translation Letters on Artillery, 1887); Briefe √ºber Strategie (1877; Letters on Strategy, 1898); and Gespr√§che √ºber Reiterei (1887; Conversations on Cavalry). The Briefe √ºber Infanterie and Briefe √ºber Kavallerie (Letters on Infantry, Letters on Cavalry, 1889) are of less importance, though interesting as a reflection of prevailing German ideas.  Memoirs  Kraft's memoirs (Aus meinem Leben) were prepared in retirement near Dresden, and the first volume (1897) created such a sensation that eight years were allowed to elapse before the publication was continued. Kraft died near Dresden in 1892.  References  * Kurt von Priesdorff: Soldatisches F√ºhrertum.

Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of myelin, the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. MLD involves cerebroside sulfate accumulation. Metachromatic leukodystrophy, like most enzyme deficiencies, has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Signs and symptoms Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late infantile, juvenile, and adult. * In the late infantile form, which is the most common form of MLD (50‚Äì60%), affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life, usually at 15‚Äì24 months. Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner. * Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia, then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset. Some patients can live for several decades after onset. * The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more. Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity. Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\\"normal\\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.  Causes  Diagram showing the disrupted pathway MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls.Fluharty, Arvan. \\"Arylsulfatase A Deficiency: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, ARSA Deficiency\\". GeneReviews, 2006 However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD. Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system ‚Äì CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system ‚Äì PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly. Arylsulfatase A is activated by saposin B (Sap B), a non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor. When the arylsulfatase A enzyme level is normal but the sulfatides are still high ‚Äì meaning that they are not being broken down because the enzyme is not activated ‚Äì the resulting disease is saposin B deficiency, which presents similar to MLD. Saposin B Deficiency is very rare, much more rare than traditional MLD. The enzyme that is present is not \\"enabled\\" to a normal level of efficiency and can't break down the sulfatides which results in all of the same MLD symptoms and progression. A 2011 study contended sulfatide is not completely responsible for MLD because it is nontoxic. It has been suggested lysosulfatide, sulfatide which has had its acyl group removed, plays a role because of its cytotoxic properties in vitro. Genetics right MLD has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The inheritance probabilities per birth are as follows: * If both parents are carriers: ** 25% (1 in 4) children will have the disease ** 50% (2 in 4) children will be carriers, but unaffected ** 25% (1 in 4) children will be free of MLD ‚Äì unaffected child that is not a carrier * If one parent is affected and one is free of MLD: ** 0% (0) children will have the disorder ‚Äì only one parent is affected, other parent always gives normal gene ** 100% (4 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected) * If one parent is a carrier and the other is free of MLD: ** 50% (2 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected) ** 50% (2 in 4) children will be free of MLD ‚Äì unaffected child that is not a carrier In addition to these frequencies there is a 'pseudo'-deficiency that affects 7‚Äì15% of the population. People with the pseudo deficiency do not have any MLD problems unless they also have affected status. With the current diagnostic tests, Pseudo-deficiency reports as low enzyme levels but sulfatide is processed normally so MLD symptoms do not exist. This phenomenon wreaks havoc with traditional approaches to Newborn Screening so new screening methods are being developed. For further information, see recessive gene and dominance relationship. Also, consult the MLD genetics page at MLD Foundation. [revise or delete] Diagnosis Clinical examination and MRI are often the first steps in an MLD diagnosis. MRI can be indicative of MLD but is not adequate as a confirming test.An ARSA-A enzyme level blood test with a confirming urinary sulfatide test is the best biochemical test for MLD. The confirming urinary sulfatide is important to distinguish between MLD and pseudo-MLD blood results.Genomic sequencing may also confirm MLD, however, there are likely more mutations than the over 200 already known to cause MLD that are not yet ascribed to MLD that cause MLD so in those cases a biochemical test is still warranted. Newborn Screening MLD Foundation formally launched a newborn screening initiative in late 2017. The screen development started in the early 2010's at the University of Washington Gelb Biochemistry lab. A deidentified pilot study launched in April 2016 in Washington State. Positive results led to MLD being included in the ScreenPlus identified baby research project in New York state, which is currently scheduled to launch in Q4'2020. An Expert Advisory Group (EAG) was launched in February 2020 to define the MLD NSB flow and prepare a RUSP Nomination. Seven Working Focus Groups (WFG) are supporting the EAG in their efforts. In parallel, the MLD community is organizing to support the worldwide implementation of MLD newborn screening.  Treatment  There is currently no therapy or cure for MLD in late infantile patients displaying symptoms, or for juvenile and adult-onset with advanced symptoms. These patients typically receive clinical treatment focused on pain and symptom management. Pre- symptomatic late infantile MLD patients, as well as those with juvenile or adult MLD that are either presymptomatic or displaying mild symptoms, can consider bone marrow transplantation (including stem cell transplantation), which may slow down the progression of the disease in the central nervous system. However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed. Recent success has involved stem cells being taken from the bone marrow of children with the disorder and infecting the cells with a retro-virus, replacing the stem cells' mutated gene with the repaired gene before re-injecting it back into the patient where they multiplied. The children by the age of five were all in good condition and going to kindergarten when normally by this age, children with the disease can not even speak. Several therapy options are currently being investigated using clinical trials primarily in late infantile patients. These therapies include gene therapy, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), and potentially enzyme enhancement therapy (EET). Gene therapy was submitted to the EMA for review in December 2019. The trial sponsor has indicated they will are targetting submission for US FDA review during 1st half 2021. On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Libmeldy (autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that contains hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A gene), a gene therapy for the treatment of children with the 'late infantile' (LI) or 'early juvenile' (EJ) forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. The active substance of Libmeldy consists of the child's own stem cells which have been modified to contain working copies of the ARSA gene. Libmeldy is indicated for use in children with the 'late infantile' or 'early juvenile' forms of MLD, who have been identified as carriers of the defective gene but have not yet developed symptoms. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. It is also indicated in children who have been diagnosed with the early juvenile form who have started developing symptoms but still have the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline. Libmeldy is a gene therapy medicinal product, for which CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are collected either from the patient's own bone marrow or mobilised peripheral blood. These cells are modified to insert a functional gene to produce the ARSA enzyme. When the modified cells are injected back into the patient as a one-time infusion, the cells are expected to start producing the ARSA enzyme that breaks down the build-up of sulfatides in the nerve cells and other cells of the patient's body. Epidemiology The incidence of metachromatic leukodystrophy is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide. There is a much higher incidence in certain genetically isolated populations, such as 1 in 75 in Habbanites (a small group of Jews who immigrated to Israel from southern Arabia), 1 in 2,500 in the western portion of the Navajo Nation, and 1 in 8,000 among Arab groups in Israel.Metachromatic leukodystrophy at Genetics Home Reference. Reviewed September 2007 As an autosomal recessive disease, 1 in 40,000 equates to a 1 in 100 carrier frequency in the general population. There are an estimated 3,600 MLD births per year, with 1,900 alive in the US, 3,100 in Europe, and 49,000 alive worldwide with MLD. MLD is considered a rare disease in the US and other countries. Research =Bone marrow and stem cell transplant therapies= * Several trials are underway to continue to improve the effectiveness and reduce the risks of bone marrow and stem cell transplants. =Gene therapy= (current as of October 2020) Two different approaches to gene therapy are currently being researched for MLD. * Gene therapy with an autologous stem cell transplant ‚Äì Italian researchers at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute tested a novel approach combining gene therapy with a stem cell transplant.. ** Gene therapy was submitted to the EMA for review in December 2019. The trial sponsor has indicated they will are targetting submission for US FDA review during 1st half 2021. ** A trial for early juveniles was launched in February 2020. ** Recruiting for the Phase I/II Clinical Trial formally started on March 24, 2010, after approval from the Italian Authorities. Recruiting the initial cohort of 8 patients was completed in mid-March 2013. The trial was to test the efficacy and safety of autologous (using the patient's own cells) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after genetic modification to deliver a super-therapeutic (over-expressing) ARSA enzyme to the nervous system by the route of the blood cells. Using the patient's own stem cells with genetic correction should reduce or eliminate the complications of graft vs. host disease and provide a long term solution to proper ARSA expression in MLD patients. Bench and animal tests showed positive results. The researchers published 2-year outcomes for the first three patients in July 2013. Results were described as promising. ** The Phase I/II clinical trial is complete. No additional patients are being recruited while the data is analyzed and work progresses to improve the manufacturability and repeatability of the technology while expansion to other geographies to increase access is being considered. ** Recruiting was completed for the 20 patient cohort in April 2015, which includes an expansion in December 2014 to add 6 additional patients. ** Inclusion criteria are pre- symptomatic late infantiles and both pre- and early-symptomatic juveniles. See details on inclusion criteria and the trial protocol here. ** The trial was at a single center at the San Raffaele Institute in Milan, Italy. All costs were to be paid by the researchers. This was a 3-year study. In March 2013, the last of the 8 primary trial patients started therapy. The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ** In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare for the next phase of study. * Intracerebral Gene therapy ‚Äì A Phase I/II Clinical Trial started recruiting in Paris in late March, 2013 for an Intracerebral Gene Therapy clinical trial where special \\"vectors\\" carrying genetically modified material are directly injected into a dozen sites in the brain. The hope is that the corrected cells and the enzyme they produce will then diffuse into surrounding areas of the brain. Extensive work in the lab and some encouraging ALD studies provided the basis for this trial. This trial was subsequently terminated before completion. =Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)= (current as of September 2019) * Takeda aquired the MLD ERT from Shire in early 2018 and continues to develop and studying their intrathecal SHP 611 (formerly HGT-1110) ERT [Enzyme Replacement Therapy]. * Clinical Trial ** A third global trial studying the late infantile form of MLD for 42 patients aged 6 - 72 months launched in April 2019.. This is the first time ERT study sites are open in the US. ** Clinical trial information & inclusion criteria can be found on the MLD Foundation website's ERT page and at the Clinical Trials.gov site. =Substrate reduction therapy= * Biomarin South (formerly Zacharon before being acquired by Biomarin in January 2013) from San Diego had initiated a drug discovery program for MLD. This program is based on using assays which measure sulfatide accumulation in cultured fibroblasts as a means to discover and develop small molecule drugs for MLD. (This approach differs from other approaches which have measured enzyme activity to discover effective drugs.) As of July 2011, Zacharon has begun adapting the assays it developed for other lysosomal storage diseases so that they can be employed to discover and develop drugs for MLD. (current March 2013) * The Cooper Health System (New Jersey) sponsored a clinical trial underway to determine the safety and efficacy of a Vitamin K antagonist (Warfarin) in treating Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) in 2009. No results are known to have been published. (current March 2013) =Natural history studies= * A natural history study (NHS) launched in Washington, DC in January 2014 to study 30 patients with additional study centers opened in the US, Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, and South America. Due to challenges in recruiting this study has been cancelled. More information here (current January 2017) * A natural history study has been underway in Pittsburgh, PA since November 2012.

Early life Steven W. Marker was born in Mamaroneck, New York on March 16, 1959. He spent most of his childhood and his teens in Mamaroneck, New York. At the age of 6, his parents bought him drums; but, at 12, he shifted instruments and took up the guitar. He graduated from Rye Neck High School in Mamaroneck. Marker attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison for a degree in film. There, he met Butch Vig, who played with the band Spooner. In 1979 the group was trying to figure out how to record a 7-inch single and Marker had grown an interest in musical producing, he bought a four-track reel-to-reel deck, which complemented by Vig's microphones became a home studio in Marker's basement. Marker and Vig also started a small label, Boat Records, to release records of both Spooner and other bands they liked.Steve Marker of Garbage on his approach to production and the joys of living in ColoradoPunks: A Guide to an American Subculture. Sharon M. Hannon. p. 115 Career Marker co-founded Madison's Smart Studios with Butch Vig in 1983, and maintained a production career engineering and mixing records until he formed Garbage with Vig and Vig's bandmate in Spooner, Duke Erikson, in 1994. He famously spotted Angelfish singer Shirley Manson's music video on MTV's 120 Minutes, which led to her joining the group, as Marker felt that Manson differed from the high pitched and screechy female singers of the 1990s and \\"was more like the voices that we loved growing up, which was more Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde ‚Äì sort of that classic pop sound ‚Äì maybe Dusty Springfield.\\" Marker stated that his musical style is not influenced by \\"the guys that played twenty minute solos\\", stating he always preferred \\"guitar parts that sort of work melodically more in a Beatles sense\\", with artists such as Tom Petty, Keith Richards, The Pretenders and Robert Fripp. Marker considered that his background as a producer helped develop a type of playing where \\"you're not there to show off, to show how brilliant you are or draw attention to yourself. You're there to make the song work in whatever way is necessary\\", stating that the guitar \\"is there to serve the song\\". Personal life Marker is married, and has a daughter named Ruby (born March 2000). After living for 25 years in Madison, following Garbage's hiatus in 2005, Marker relocated to Carbondale, Colorado with his family.

However, following the election of a new governor, the session starts in January with the governor's address but then adjourns until February. On the first day of the session, members of both the House and the Senate sit in joint session in the House chamber where the governor presents his or her legislative program. The length of the general session may not go beyond 60 calendar days unless extended by a concurrent resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of each house. The governor may convene the Legislature for extraordinary sessions. Given the part-time nature of the legislature of West Virginia, multiple extraordinary sessions are not uncommon.

However they are captured by Rudolf Hagen, an effeminate but over-sexed man who wants to use the Lagu to transform the world, destroying its inhabitants, and replacing them with an army of young women called the Delmo Corporation who will carry his progeny. Alongside Rudolf is his obsessive sister Neena Hagen, who is jealous of Aika when Rudolf desires to have Aika for himself. Aika has a special bustier that, when activated, transforms into a battle bikini that gives her extraordinary fighting powers. Following the defeat of the Hagens, the Delmo Corporation girls seek other methods to foil Aika in episodic stories. Characters =Protagonists= * AIKa characters. Studio Fantasia and Bandai Visual.

Release The first four episodes were released from April 25, 1997 to January 25, 1998. The opening theme for the first four episodes was \\"Silent City\\", performed by Mari Sasaki, and the closing theme was \\"More Natural\\" by Hiroko Konishi. Each episode is numbered as a Trial. The next three episodes were released from August 25, 1998 to April 25, 1999. The animation was redone to include the new characters such as Michikusa. The opening theme was by Mink, and the closing theme was \\"Dance with Me Tonight\\" by Punky Fruites. =Episode list= Reception In reviewing the first volume, Chris Beveridge on Mania.com wrote that he had to put his brain in a certain mode, likening the experience to watching Dumb and Dumber where \\"Instead of idiot humor we're watching this for the sheer amount of fanservice.\\" with its \\"four gajillion panty shots\\" and that it was a \\"great deal of mindless fun\\". He described Michikusa as \\"a waifish goofy ass boy who serves only one purpose: to be on screen and take time away from panty shots.\\" Stig Hogset of THEM Anime Reviews wrote that the show should have been a guilty pleasure but ends up being more of an overdose: \\"EVERY action scene seems to end up with unconscious females lying with their butts poking up into the air.\\" He called the villains the creepiest he has ever seen, but recommended the show only to those with a panty or ass fetish. The Anime News Network reviewer wrote that \\"It's as if someone tried to make the most perverted anime they could without anyone actually being in any sexual situations. (Okay, so there are some.)\\", later adding that \\"The dub is weak and mistimed, and some of the minor characters just plain can't act.\\" and recommended that the viewer watch titles from the company's Anime 18 productions instead. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk likened Aika's transformation to that in Cutie Honey and called the series the \\"epitome of guilty pleasure anime\\". He found the show to be solid-looking with fantastic animation and character design. With regards to the audio, he thought the Japanese cast did a much better job with the material than the English cast, writing that the latter was \\"particularly bland and it didn't maintain the necessary spark for this kind of show.\\"  References  External links * Category:1997 anime OVAs Category:Action anime and manga Category:Bandai Entertainment anime titles Category:Central Park Media Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Espionage in anime and manga Category:Post-apocalyptic anime and manga Category:Wani Books manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Studio Fantasia ","title":"Agent Aika"},{"id":"2189154","text":"Suhayl Saadi (born 1961, Beverley, Yorkshire) is a physician, author and dramatist based in Glasgow, Scotland.

It is located in Region A of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. History Vorna Valley derives its name from the Galaun family's home village of Varniai (Vornia), Lithuania. Jacob and Michelle, Father and Mother of brothers Joseph, Israel, Louis, Harry, Abe and sisters Leah, Malka, Tzira and Zira, lived in Lithuania. Jacob owned a butchery and leased a piece of land on which they kept cattle. Michelle came from a cheese-making family. The Galaun family sold cheese as well as milk to supplement their income from their butchery. Many Jewish youths from Lithuania emigrated due to the military conscription, poverty and anti-semitism. Louis Galaun moved to South Africa where he established himself as an established property developer and owned a bottle store and land known as Halfway House. Louis eventually established the township of Vorna Valley in the 1970s. The main arterial road was named after his brother, Harry Galaun. While other streets in the suburb were named after mainly South African artists, poets, writers, performers and influential people in the world of arts at that time.

Founded in 1891, at the downtown address of Biblioteksgatan 8 in the district of Norrmalm, the club is the largest in Scandinavia. The club's achievements include Swedish championship titles in a slew of sports: football, ice hockey, bandy, handball, floorball, bowling, badminton, athletics and many other sports as well as Wimbledon championships and French Open in tennis (through Sven Davidson, Lennart Bergelin and Ulf Schmidt). Founding The idea to start an athletic association began when the brothers Isidor and Paul Behrens were taking a walk through Hantverkargatan, in central Stockholm. They were walking pretty fast; and noticed that there were two other youngsters behind them who also walked quickly. The strangers tried to walk past the Behrens, so they had to speed up to keep the lead; but the strangers did the same. Finally all of them started to run in what now looked like an improvised competition. When Isidor and Paul were far away from the unknown youngsters, Isidor said that they should start an athletic association and compete with others. So the brothers gathered their friends, who had strong athletic interest, and held a meeting at Behrens' on February 15, 1891, on Biblioteksgatan 8, in central Stockholm. Isidor introduced his idea to everyone, and they liked it. Since the boys agreed that every thinkable sport should be practiced, they decided that ‚ÄúAllm√§nna Idrottsklubben‚Äù (The General Sports Club) would be a suitable name. The name also had other meanings: AIK allowed anybody to become a member; and at this time many athletic clubs were limited (e.g. the military). Media On 5 February 1995, AIK became the first non-American sports club to promote an Internet website. Supporters During the 1980s and 1990s AIK's official supporter group Black Army raged havoc around the country, making headlines in national newspapers. As a result of Black Army's bad behaviour another supporter group was created in 2000, Allm√§nna Supporterklubben (the General Supporters Club), as an option to Black Army. In 2002 Allm√§nna Supporterklubben was renamed to the much more AIK related name \\"Smokinglirarna\\" (roughly, \\"The Players\\", literally \\"the Black Tie Players\\"). In 2002 an ultras group was formed, Ultras Nord (Ultras North), and two years later, 2004, Sol Invictus was formed. Black Army, Smokinglirarna, Ultras Nord and Sol Invictus together with AIK-Tifo forms the so-called AIK-Alliansen (the AIK Alliance).

Const. art. I, ¬ß 26 [adopted November 3, 1964, and repealed November 5, 1974]. Proposition 14 was declared unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court in 1966.Mulkey v. Reitman (1966) 64 Cal. 2d 529 The decision of the California Supreme Court was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967 in Reitman v. Mulkey.Reitman v. Mulkey (1967) 387 U.S. 369 Political science research has tied white support for Proposition 14 to \\"racial threat theory\\", which holds that an increase in the racial minority population triggers a fearful and discriminatory response by the dominating racial majority. Circumstances Leading to Proposition 14 In 1948, the United States Supreme Court in Shelley v. Kraemer precluded judicial enforcement of racially restrictive housing covenants.Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (May 1948) Prior to 1948, the California Real Estate Association (the eventual sponsor of Proposition 14) routinely promoted and enforced racially restrictive housing covenants to prevent family homes from ending up in the hands of minorities, particularly Negroes. Shortly following the 1948 court decision in Shelley, an item appeared in the California Real Estate magazine, a publication of the California Real Estate Association (the organization is currently named the California Association of Realtors) advocating an amendment to the United States Constitution that would overturn Shelley and constitutionally guarantee the legal enforcement of racially restrictive covenants throughout the United States. In advocating support for a federal constitutional amendment guaranteeing the legal enforcement of racially restrictive covenants, the California Real Estate Association publication stated that \\"millions of home owners of the Caucasian race have constructed or acquired homes in areas restricted against occupancy by Negroes. The practice of surrounding homes in such areas with the security of such restrictions has become a traditional element of value in home ownership throughout this nation.\\" The publication further stated: \\"The recent decisions of the Supreme Court abovementioned have destroyed the values thus secured. The threat of occupancy by Negroes of property in such areas depreciates the value of all home properties and constitutes a direct deterrent to investment in the construction or acquisition of homes of superior quality whether large or small. The experience has been uniform that whenever and wherever Negroes have occupied homes in such areas this has not only depreciated values of the properties which they own, but has depreciated the values of all surrounding properties.\\" In further support of the constitutional amendment, the publication stated: \\"Moreover, the prices of homes in such areas are well within the purchasing power of vast numbers of Negroes. These circumstances greatly aggravate the hazard to which such home owners are exposed. ... Additionally, the insistence of some Negroes upon moving into areas previously restricted exclusively to the occupancy of Caucasians will necessarily create racial tensions and antagonisms and do much harm to our national social structure.\\" The federal constitutional amendment effort was unsuccessful, but the reasons for pursuing such an amendment provided insight into the underlying reasons for pursuing a future and similar protective state constitutional amendment in California. Despite the court decision in Shelley, segregation in California continued. As an example, an insidious form of segregation known as blockbusting occurred in East Palo Alto. In 1954, a white resident sold his house to a black family. Almost immediately, agents of the California Real Estate Association began warning of a \\"Negro invasion\\" and even staged burglaries to panic white homeowners to sell at below-market prices. Those properties were then sold to Negroes at higher-than-market prices with real estate interests profiting from the transactions. The tipping point for the California Real Estate Association to pursue a state constitutional amendment in California was the enactment of the Rumford Fair Housing Act in 1963. In the minds of California Real Estate Association leaders, the Rumford Fair Housing Act directly threatened the financial interests of the real estate industry who came to see \\"the promotion, preservation, and manipulation of racial segregation as central -- rather than incidental or residual -- components of their profit generating strategies.\\" Similar to Proposition 14, there have also been subsequent efforts by the real estate industry to promote ballot measures in California to generate more profits. Examples include the unsuccessful 2018 California Proposition 5Official Voter Information Guide, California General Election (November 6, 2018), pp. 34-39. and 2020 California Proposition 19,Official Voter Information Guide, California General Election (November 3, 2020), pp. 38-43. which has been criticized for not helping first-time homeowners who are disproportionately minoritiesThe Greenlining Institute, 2020 California Ballot Propositions Guide [Proposition 19] (September 16, 2020). and for reinforcing racial inequity within California's tax system. Rumford Fair Housing Act The Rumford Fair Housing Act was passed in 1963 by the California Legislature to help end racial discrimination by property owners and landlords who refused to rent or sell their property to \\"colored\\" people.Health & Saf. Code, ¬ß¬ß 35700-35744 [added by Stats. 1963, Ch. 1853, ¬ß 2]. It was drafted by William Byron Rumford, the first African American from Northern California to serve in the legislature. The Act provided that landlords could not deny people housing because of ethnicity, religion, sex, marital status, physical handicap, or familial status. Proposition 14 In 1964, the California Real Estate Association (currently named the California Association of Realtors) sponsored an initiative constitutional amendment to counteract the effects of the Act. The initiative, numbered Proposition 14 when it was certified for the ballot, was to add an amendment (Cal. Const. art. I, ¬ß 26) to the constitution of California. This amendment would provide, in part, as follows: The amendment attempted to re-legalize discrimination and associational privacy by landlords and property owners. = Ballot Arguments = The ballot argument in favor of Proposition 14 stated that the constitutional amendment \\"will guarantee the right of all home and apartment owners to choose buyers and renters of their property as they wish, without interference by State or local government.\\" The argument further stated that \\"most owners of such property in California lost this right through the Rumford Act of 1963. It says they may not refuse to sell or rent their property to anyone for reasons of race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry.\\" The ballot argument against Proposition 14 stated that Proposition 14 \\"would write hate and bigotry into the Constitution.\\" The argument further stated that Proposition 14 \\"would legalize and incite bigotry. At a time when our nation is moving ahead on civil rights, it proposes to convert California into another Mississippi or Alabama and to create an atmosphere for violence and hate.\\" = Endorsements = Following much publicity the proposition gained the endorsement of many large conservative political groups, including the John Birch Society and the California Republican Assembly. As these and other groups endorsed the proposal it became increasingly more popular and the petition to have the proposition added to the ballot garnered over one million signatures. This was more than twice the 480,000 signatures that were required.  Los Angeles Times Endorsement  In endorsing Proposition 14, the Los Angeles Times stated: ‚ÄúOne of man‚Äôs most ancient rights in a free society is the privilege of using and disposing of his private property in whatever manner he deems appropriate.‚Äù The editorial further stated: ‚ÄúBut we do feel, and strongly, that housing equality cannot safely be achieved at the expense of still another basic right.‚Äù In a letter-to-the-editor response to the Times' endorsement of Proposition 14, then-California Attorney General Stanley Mosk stated: ‚ÄúI oppose the segregation initiative. I oppose it because it sugar- coats bigotry with an appeal to generalities we can accept, while ignoring the specific problem that confronts us.‚Äù = Heated campaign = The Proposition 14 campaign was heated and included several controversial comments from Edmund Brown who was the Governor of California at the time. Governor Brown stated that passage of Proposition 14 would put into California‚Äôs Constitution ‚Äúa provision for discrimination of which not even Mississippi or Alabama can boast.‚Äù Previously, Governor Brown had likened the campaign for Proposition 14 to ‚Äúanother hate binge which began more than 30 years ago in a Munich beer hall.‚Äù In a letter to the editor response to several items published in the Los Angeles Times relating to Proposition 14, Governor Brown wrote: ‚ÄúI submit that it is not the Governor who is inflammatory. It is Proposition 14. And I submit that it is not the opponents of Proposition 14 who encourage the racists and bigots in this state, but those who support Proposition 14.‚Äù Martin Luther King Jr. visited California on multiple occasions to campaign against Proposition 14, saying its passage would be \\"one of the most shameful developments in our nation‚Äôs history.\\" = Election results = Proposition 14 appeared on the November 3, 1964 general election ballot in California. The ballot proposition easily passed with 65.39% support, receiving 4,526,460 votes in support and 2,395,747 votes against.California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 3, 1964 General Election, p. 25. Notable counties voting in favor of Proposition 14 included: Alameda County (60.6% support), Contra Costa County (64.6% support), Los Angeles County (67.4% support), Marin County (52.2% support), Sacramento County (61.6% support), San Francisco County (52.9% support), San Mateo County (60.2% support), Santa Clara County (53.1% support), Santa Cruz County (58.5% support), Solano County (69.7% support), Sonoma County (61.8% support), and Yolo County (56.4% support).California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 3, 1964 General Election, p. 25. Notable cities voting in favor of Proposition 14 included: Alameda, Oakland, Richmond, Fresno, Inglewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Lynwood, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Salinas, Santa Ana, Palm Springs, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, San Jose, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Vallejo, Santa Rosa, Modesto, Oxnard, and Ventura.California Secretary of State, Supplement to Statement of Vote November 3, 1964 General Election, pp. 65-78. A 2018 study in the American Political Science Review found that white voters in areas which experienced massive African-American population growth between 1940 and 1960 were more likely to vote for Proposition 14. Political scientists have taken this as evidence for \\"racial threat theory\\", which holds that the rapid increase in a minority population triggers fears among the majority race population, leading the majority to impose higher levels of social control on the subordinate race. Unconstitutionality Soon after Proposition 14 was passed, the federal government cut off all housing funds to California. Many also cited the proposition as one of the causes of the Watts Riots of 1965. With the federal housing funds cut off and with the support of Governor Pat Brown, the constitutionality of the measure was challenged soon afterward. In 1966, the California Supreme Court did not consider whether Proposition 14 was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection and due process provisions of the California Constitution; instead, it held that Proposition 14 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.64 Cal. 2d 529 (1966) Gov. Brown's stance proved controversial; later in 1966, he was defeated in his bid for re-election by Ronald Reagan. However, Reagan opposed both Proposition 14 and the Rumford Act, and stated that Proposition 14 was ‚Äúnot a wise measure.‚Äù Reagan labeled the Rumford Act as an attempt \\"to give one segment of our population a right at the expense of the basic rights of all our citizens.\\"Skelton, George (May 7, 2014) \\"Thank you, Donald Sterling, for reminding us how far we've come\\" Los Angeles Times However, the case continued. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the California Supreme Court's decision in Reitman v. Mulkey (1967), holding that Proposition 14 was invalid because it violated the equal protection clause. The proposition was repealed by Proposition 7 in the November, 1974 election. Reitman established a significant precedent because it held that state assistance or encouragement of private discrimination violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.

After beginning his career in the theatre, Sherwin became an actor in television before moving into writing. He became the story editor on Doctor Who and, as the producer of the series in 1969, he oversaw the transition from black and white to colour by producing Patrick Troughton's final story and Jon Pertwee's first. He also co-produced Paul Temple for the BBC. Early life Sherwin began his career in the theatre and worked as a junior set designer, scenic artist, scene shifter, stage manager and lighting designer. He also spent two years of National Service in the Royal Air Force. Following this, Sherwin established himself as an actor in theatre, films and television. While still working as an actor, Sherwin also began work as a freelance writer, contributing scripts to series such as Crossroads and Z-Cars.Doctor Who. The Seventies. Howe- Stammers-Walker, 1994, Doctor Who Books, ASIN: B0013CRH64 Doctor Who In 1967, Sherwin was offered a story-editing role on Doctor Who by BBC Head of Serials Shaun Sutton. He was story editor/script editor on the stories from The Web of Fear to The Mind Robber, on the latter tale writing the first episode. He also wrote the script for The Invasion, which introduced the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT), having adapted the original storyline supplied by Kit Pedler. In 1968‚Äì1969, Sherwin began to take a greater role in the producing side of Doctor Who, and after the serial The Mind Robber, he became the unofficial assistant producer for the next three serials, with Terrance Dicks succeeding him as script editor. On The Space Pirates, Sherwin briefly resumed his old role as script editor, while Dicks was busy writing the epic 10-part season finale The War Games with Malcolm Hulke. Dicks credited Sherwin with the creation of the Time Lords, who were introduced in The War Games.Voice-over commentary on the BBC DVD \\"The War Games\\" (1969, 2009) Sherwin succeeded Peter Bryant as producer in 1969 for the serials The War Games and Spearhead from Space. Sherwin was also involved in the casting of Jon Pertwee in the lead role on the programme. He made a small on-screen appearance as a car park attendant in Spearhead from Space as he was still a member of the actors' union. He had dismissed the actor originally cast in the part for not being able to perform the role adequately. Sherwin was responsible for the idea of exiling the Doctor to Earth (which happens at the end of the Second Doctor's last serial, The War Games), a decision he took in an attempt to improve falling viewing figures, reinvent the programme and bring more reality to Doctor Who by basing it more on Nigel Kneale's Quatermass serials from the 1950s. For this purpose, Sherwin created the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT) in The Invasion as an organisation that the Doctor could become allied to on Earth during his exile. UNIT became a prominent feature of Doctor Who throughout the Third Doctor's era, when Doctor Who was produced by Sherwin's successor, Barry Letts. Sherwin left Doctor Who after Jon Pertwee's debut serial, Spearhead from Space. After leaving Doctor Who, Sherwin maintained connections with the series. When Michael Grade attempted to cancel it in 1985, Sherwin offered to ‚Äútake it off [his] hands‚Äù and ‚Äúproduce it independently‚Äù, and also claimed to have done this a second time with Peter Cregeen, the man responsible for Doctor Who‚Äôs actual cancellation in 1989. He later contributed to several documentaries for the Doctor Who DVD range, as well as providing commentaries for the two stories he produced and surviving episodes of The Web of Fear and The Wheel in Space for the Lost in Time collection. Other work After Doctor Who, Sherwin once again worked alongside Peter Bryant, after Bryant successfully persuaded Sherwin to join him on the production of Paul Temple (1969-1971). Sherwin later produced The Man Outside (1972), Skiboy (1973), and The Perils of Pendragon (1974). Death Derrick Sherwin died on 17 October 2018 following a long illness.

The population was 528 at the 2010 census. Located on Mountain Fork River, about from the Oklahoma-Arkansas border, it was the first permanent Choctaw settlement in the Indian Territory, who called it osi yamaha (\\"Eagle\\"). It was an important town from 1834 to 1906, and after 1850, served as county seat for the Choctaw Nation's Eagle County. The town name was officially changed to \\"Eagle Town\\" in 1850, then changed to the present Eagletown in 1892. When Indian Territory was preparing to unite with Oklahoma Territory to form the new state of Oklahoma in 1906, Eagletown lost its county seat status and became just another unincorporated community in the new McCurtain County. History Some white settlers had moved to the area near Mountain Fork River around the present Eagletown during the early 19th Century, when the area was known as Miller County, Arkansas. but a boundary change in the 1820s put this area into Indian Territory. The white settlers were forced to move elsewhere in order to resettle the Choctaw tribe from Mississippi. When the first Choctaws arrived in 1832, they found fields that had been cleared for farming and cabins that had housed the previous inhabitants. As required by treaty, the Army established a feeding point here for the distribution of rations. An estimated 852 people were receiving rations here in April 1832. By 1834, the number of people here had grown by 1,500.Coleman, Louis. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Eagletown.\\" Retrieved August 8, 2013. The Choctaws invited some of the white missionaries to join them in the move to Indian Territory. The first of these was Rev. Loring S. Williams, who was sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1832. By July 1832, Williams established a station he called Bethabara on the west bank of the Mountain Fork River. The crossing was marked by a very large cypress tree that was called \\"the oldest tree in Oklahoma\\", dating back to before the Christian Era. He organized the first church in Choctaw country in 1834 and opened a school the next year. He also obtained the authority to establish a post office in 1834, and served as the first postmaster. The post office and the town were then known as \\"Eagle Town.\\" The name of both was officially changed to \\"Eagletown\\" on December 16, 1892.\\"Eagletown Choctaw Settlement.\\" McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Accessed April 17, 2018. Another missionary, Reverend Cyrus Byington, arrived in late 1835. Byington spent 31 years here, and was noted for translating both religious and secular materials into a written Choctaw language that he created. He established the Stockbridge Mission on the other (east) side of the river from Bethabara. He was most noted for producing the Dictionary of the Choctaw Language. Byington also supervised the adjacent Iyanubbi Female Seminary, a boarding school for Choctaw girls that operated from 1844 until 1861. Eagletown soon became a trading center on the Military Trace, an important road through Choctaw Country. After the Choctaw Nation created and passed its constitution in 1850, Eagletown became the \\"courtground\\" (i. e., county seat) of the newly created Eagle County. Jefferson Gardner, a Choctaw trader, opened a general store in 1874 on the east bank of the river. In 1884, built an imposing house that is now on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Gardner became principal chief of the Choctaw Nation, but lost his fortune shortly after his term ended in 1896. After Oklahoma became a state, more white settlers moved into the former Choctaw territory. Eagle County had been abolished and superseded by McCurtain County at statehood. Some of the settlers became farmers, while others worked in the expanding timber industry. Choctaw Lumber Company built a camp in Eagletown to house the timberworkers. The company also built a railroad (the Texas, Oklahoma and Eastern) that connected to its line in Arkansas. The Texas, Oklahoma and Eastern Railroad laid a track from Valliant, Oklahoma to DeQueen, Arkansas in 1920. It built a depot southeast of the river crossing. Many of the existing Eagleton businesses moved to new facilities near the new depot. Little remains of the old Eagle Town except the Gardner house.

They include Tullu Demtu, the second-highest mountain in Ethiopia (4377 meters), and Mount Batu (4307 meters). The Weyib River, a tributary of the Jubba River, rises in these mountains east of Goba. The Bale Mountains National Park covers 2,200 square kilometers of these mountains. The main attractions of the park are the wild alpine scenery, and the relative ease with which visitors can see unique birds and mammals.  Fauna  The Bale Mountains are home to many of Ethiopia's endemic animals, notably the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), found on the Sanetti Plateau. The park also contains the Harenna Forest, situated to the south of the mountains, which is a largely unexplored area thought to contain many undiscovered species of reptile as well as lions, leopards and various types of antelope. Besides wildlife, the National Park offers trekking opportunities from the park headquarters at Dinsho. (Dodola is also a useful base for exploring these mountains.) The largest group of Ethiopian wolves is found here. Other characteristic large mammals are mountain nyalas, Menelik's bushbucks, warthogs, and bohor reedbucks.  Flora  The Juniper-Hagenia forests lie between 2,500 and 3,300 m and are mostly found on the northern slopes. An unusual plant of the Dinsho area is the white-flowered Abyssinian rose. The alpine moorland of the Saneti Plateau is covered in heath-like vegetation broken by heather plants and stands of giant lobelia which grow up to 6 meters high. One of the most common and distinctive plants throughout the Bale region is the red-hot poker, an aloe which can be identified by its orange spear-shaped flowers. Local History in Ethiopia  Archaeological findings  Archaeologists have discovered a 30,000-year-old Middle-Stone Age rock shelter at the Fincha Habera site in Bale Mountains of Ethiopia over 11,000 feet above sea level in 2019. According to the study published Science journal, this dwelling was the earliest proof of the highest-altitude of human occupation. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were revealed on the ground.

One source says that he was the most powerful chief on Puget Sound from 1790 to 1845. Kitsap County, Washington and the Kitsap Peninsula are named for him. He was an ancestor of Johnny Kitsap, 1908, also known as Chief Kitsap. Having been prominent before white settlement of Puget Sound began, oral history is the only basis for most of what can be said about Kitsap, and many reports offer conflicting information. He may have been one of the Indians who was welcomed aboard HMS Discovery by Captain George Vancouver during his exploration of Puget Sound. Some sources indicate that it was Kitsap who had Old Man House, Puget Sound's largest longhouse, built on Agate Pass, though other sources debate this. Aside from being one of the best-known war chiefs of the Suquamish, at one point Kitsap was acknowledged as the head of the largest intertribal coalition which the Puget Sound had ever seen. Around 1825, The Puget Sound Indians, not normally organized above the level of individual bands, formed a confederation under Kitsap to strike against the Cowichan Tribes of southeast Vancouver Island, who often raided the Puget Sound. However, Kitsap's flotilla was no match for the larger canoes of the Cowichans; after suffering heavy losses in the sea battle, the Puget Sound Indians were forced to retreat. Kitsap was one of the few survivors of this ill-fated expedition. Sources suggest that Kitsap was the brother of Schweabe, the father of Chief Seattle. Another Kitsap, a leader of the Muckleshoot tribe, was prominent in the Indian War of 1855‚Äì1856. Like his comrade in arms, Chief Leschi, Kitsap was arrested for the part he played in the hostilities, but he was acquitted. Known to boast of his healing skills and his supposed invincibility (he claimed that no man could kill him), Kitsap of the Muckleshoot was killed shortly after returning to his tribe in 1860. Three of his tribesmen had fallen ill, and died after he administered them a red liquid as medicine; their relations killed Kitsap to avenge what they saw as willful murder.

It was located at first in Bishop Street moving in 1914 to Cook Street. History The first model, the Carette was a three-wheeled cyclecar with a side-valve, water-cooled Crouch V-twin engine of 740 cc mounted behind the seats. It was of unconventional appearance with a low, wide radiator. The chassis frame was of ash with metal armouring and the drive was to the single rear wheel via a three-speed gearbox and chain. It cost around a ¬£100 and was claimed to be capable of and . Later in 1912 it was also available as a four-wheeler with the engine enlarged to 906 cc. In 1913 it grew to 994 cc and in 1914 to 1018 cc. One of the cars gained a Gold Medal in the 1912 London-Exeter trial. When production restarted after the war the model became known as the 8 with the engine now displacing 1115 cc. The last one may have been made as late as 1922 when it cost ¬£245. In 1922 a more conventional car came along, the 8/18, still a two-seater and dickey, with pressed steel chassis and shaft drive. The V-twin engine was retained, however, but now with overhead-valves and 1248 cc capacity. It was listed at ¬£285. About 1500 V-twin cars are thought to have been made after the First World War and possibly 400 before 1914. With other manufacturers offering four-seat cars at less money it was necessary for Crouch to change and in 1922 the 12/24 was announced at ¬£350 for a four-seater and ¬£335 for a two-seater with four-cylinder Anzani 1496 cc engine and three- speed gearbox. An electric starter was fitted. A Sports and Super Sports were listed and one of these were raced at Brooklands by Alfred Moss, the father of Stirling Moss, who sold the cars from his London premises. About 800 12/24s are thought to have been made. The cars were still expensive, and so in 1923 the Economic 10/4 10 hp model was announced at ¬£250, using a four-cylinder Dorman side-valve engine of 1200 cc. It was not terribly successful and only about 60 were made. For 1925 the 12/24 became the 12/30, the Economic vanished and what was to be the final car the 11/27 was announced. This had a 1368 cc Coventry Simplex four-cylinder side-valve engine and was priced between ¬£225 and ¬£285. About 100 11/27s were made. The company disappeared with many others as a result of the Great Depression, and the rise of mass-produced small cars which could comfortably undersell the largely hand-built small-makers models. A failed export order did not help. Of the approximately 3000 cars made, only about five are known to have survived. At its peak Crouch employed about 400 people and turned out 25 cars a week. John Crouch, the founder, had trained with Daimler, and his son Bob worked there after the family firm closed. He eventually became head of bus sales. Crouch Cars of England had no connection with Crouch of New Brighton, Pennsylvania, USA, who manufactured steam cars between 1897 and 1900.

De facto corporation In order for a de facto corporation to be created, the following elements must exist: #There must be an incorporation statute that lays out the various requirements under which legal incorporation can be accomplished; #There must have been a good faith attempt to comply with the statute by the intended incorporators; #:For example, if the articles of incorporation were mailed to the appropriate office, but addressed to the wrong person, lost in the mail, or not filed by the corporation by the time the corporation began acting in an official capacity. #There must have been an act made on the corporation's behalf by its purported officers or agents. If all of these requirements are met, then the business will be treated as a corporation for all purposes, except with respect to acts by the state itself. However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a person who was aware that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation. Corporation by estoppel Corporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be estopped from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant. Differences between de facto corporation and corporation by estoppel Both doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort. The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.

He acted in The Grove Family as a regular cast member and later became the producer of Doctor Who from 1967 to 1969 during Patrick Troughton's tenure as the Second Doctor. He also produced the series Paul Temple before becoming a literary agent. Career Bryant was originally an actor and appeared in the 1950s soap opera The Grove Family. Later, he became a BBC Radio announcer while writing radio scripts as a sideline. This led to him becoming a script editor in the Radio Drama Department and eventually the head of the Drama Script Unit. In 1967 he transferred from radio to television, where head of serials Shaun Sutton put him to work with script editor Gerry Davis on Doctor Who as a \\"Story Associate\\" then story editor. Having acted as associate producer on The Faceless Ones and The Evil of the Daleks, Bryant was tested out as full producer for The Tomb of the Cybermen, replacing Innes Lloyd, and later became full-time producer for the later Patrick Troughton stories from The Web of Fear to The Space Pirates. Bryant was also the script editor on the last 4 episodes of The Evil of the Daleks and the whole of The Abominable Snowmen, The Ice Warriors and The Enemy of the World. One of Bryant's last contributions to Doctor Who was the casting in June 1969 of Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor. After the casting of Jon Pertwee as the new Doctor, Bryant left Doctor Who to become the new producer of Paul Temple, following the departure of Alan Bromly. Bryant soon brought over Derrick Sherwin to join him on Paul Temple. Bryant and Sherwin had previously worked together on Doctor Who. Bryant later became a literary agent to writers and a casting agent to actors. One of his clients was Eric Pringle, who wrote the Doctor Who story The Awakening.
