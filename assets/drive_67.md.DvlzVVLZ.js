Joey de Leon's daughter Cheenee de Leon and Dingdong Avanzado sang a duet together on Regal Family to promote the film. Critical response Lav Diaz, writing for the Manila Standard, gave a positive review to I Love You 3x a Day, praising Jimmy Santos' unique style of comedy which involves a distinctive rambling use of the English language; he noted that in comparison to other Filipino comedians who also distort the English language, Santos' jokes and delivery are new. Diaz also praised the decision to pair Santos with Carmi Martin, whom he called \\"one of the very sturdy promoters of the stupid revolution\\", and credited the success of the film's comedy to Rene Requiestas, Jimmy Fabregas, Nova Villa, and a statue in addition to Santos' performance. However, he criticized the group of three young actors for being \\"soaked in corniness\\".

Turay is a staunch campaigner against Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). She is the founder of The Amazonian Initiative Movement, a nonprofit organization with the main objective of eliminating the cultural practice of FGM in West Africa. Personal Life When Turay was 11 years old, she, together with her sisters, had to visit their aunt at the country's capital, Freetown. Upon their arrival, Turay was forcibly blindfolded and laid down as women sat on her chest, arms, and legs. A cloth was stuffed in her mouth and she was stripped naked as women clap, sing, and shout that it was the day that she officially becomes a woman. It turns out that she wasn't sent to visit her aunt but to be genitally mutilated. The woman used a crude penknife to cut off her private parts. The women warned her as well to never to talk about the incident or else she would die. Turay recalled that the process was very painful and that she still bled after for two days. She recalled fainting after attempting to walk. When the wound healed the scar was itchy and got infected. Because of this, she sufffered intense pain during her menstruation and it resulted to blood clots and a cyst. When the time came for Turay's siblings to be genitally mutilated, Turay tried to step in, but it was unsuccessful. When her cousin died due to the same traditional practice, Turay was triggered to campaign against FGM. Career Turay worked as the country's Deputy Minister of Social welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs. In 2002, Turay led the conceptualization and establishment of the Amazonian Intitiative Movement. The History and Mission of Amazonian Initiative Movement Due to the civil war, Turay fled from the country in 1997. At the refugee camps of Guinea, she met fellow women that are against genital mutilation. With these women she formed the Amazonian Initiative Movement. In 2003, Turay returned to Sierra Leone to begin the organization's vision in her country. The Amazonian Initiative Movement, apart from educating and eradicating the deeply ingrained cultural practice of genital mutilation, aims to promote gender equality by providing women education. The nonprofit organization also addresses other issues regarding women's rights violation, specifically through child marriage, forced marriage and domestic violence. The Amazonian Initiative Movement personally visits villages to educate women regarding FGM. They also provide other means of income to the designated elders who perform FGM so as to convince them. The organization also provides a home for fleeing victims of genital mutilation. The organization faced much backlash from authorities. The organization received countless death threats, causing 4 activists to resign back then. FGM had been extremely prevalent in Sierra Leone in comparison to many countries in Africa. After years of activism, the practice is now illegal in the country, and Turay is campaigning for substitutory rites of passage that are safer than FGM. Female Genital Mutilation The act of FGM usually involves the use of razor blades, pen knives and/or broken glass. It is performed by designated elderly women in the village. For well-off families in some other countries, a medical personnel is sought so as to avoid the repercussions of the brutal and unsanitary procedure. The practice has religious, sociological, and socioeconomic reasons other than the widely held definition of womanhood — chastity.

The city of New York City includes a large Syrian population. New York City's Syrian community was historically centered in Manhattan's Little Syria, but is now centered in Brooklyn. Historically, Syrians in New York City were predominantly Christian. In the modern era, the city is home to the world's largest Syrian-Jewish community outside of Israel. 75,000 Syrian Jews live in New York City, mostly in Brooklyn. New York City is also home to a smaller community of Syrian Muslims who have lived in the city for over a century, but most of whom have immigrated since the 1960s. History Between the 1870s and the 1930s, thousands of Syrians immigrated to New York City. They immigrated from the region of Ottoman Greater Syria, now known as the Levant. Greater Syria includes what is now Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine. Immigrants from Ottoman Syria were known as \\"Syrians\\", although after the independence of Lebanon in the 1920s, some of the Syrians began to identify as Lebanese. While Syrians/Syro-Lebanese immigrants settled across the United States, New York City became the central hub of the Syrian diaspora in America. The heart of New York City's \\"Syrian Colony\\" was Little Syria in downtown Manhattan. By the early 1900s, Syrians from Little Syria began to settle in Brooklyn. Syrian Christians belonged to multiple denominations, including the Maronite Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Syrian Orthodox Church, among others. Prior to the 1960s, Syrian Muslims were a small and largely invisible population compared to the Arab Christian population. Many of the Syrian Muslims emigrated from the region of Palestine. There are educational and economic divides among the Syrian population, with Syrian Christians and Syrian Jews having higher levels of educational and economic achievement compared to the Syrian Muslim community, which is more likely to experience poverty and educational barriers. Demographics By 1910, the Syrian population of Brooklyn had surpassed the population in Manhattan. By 1930, Brooklyn was home to 10,000 Syrian-Americans.

He has developed his work between Miami, New York and Buenos Aires.  Professional development  He studied Fine Arts in Argentina at the National School of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrredon.

Shortly thereafter, he was commissioned by Patricia and Phillip Frost to paint a monumental Palladian-style Italian ceiling in their Star Island Villa in Miami Beach, which was an endorsement for him to be known in that society. He began his career as a fine art painter, and later on as muralist, using bright colors, and attracting much of Florida's jet set,Saxon Henry “His Canvas is a wall” Florida Inside Out, p.184-186 and earned the nickname \\"the Michelangelo of Miami\\". Among his clients were not only the Frost couple, but also Emilio Stefan, for whom he decorated part of the Cardozo Hotel with murals inspired on Art Deco, and Cuban businessmen Armando Codina and Manny Medina, for whom he also painted murals in their residences. Oliver Stone commissioned a portrait of Al Pacino for his film \\"Any given Sunday\\". His mural art was displayed in such New York landmarks as Tiffanys' Jewelry Salon and the Marriott Hotel. He also painted the murals in various rooms of Jackson Memorial Hospital for the United Foundation for AIDS. The fall of the Twin Towers in September 2001 found him working at the Marriott Hotel, a short distance from the attack. The need to communicate by email with his family to tell them he was safe -all phones were blocked- , was his best motivation to turn his art from the static murals to the ubiquitous internet-based design. So he started researching Warhol and Litchenstein's pop art, and ended by bringing Robert Rauschenberg's \\"transfer image technique\\" up to date.Cindy Clark “Alejandro Vigilante, the IArt Movement” Venu Magazine, pag 52 to 57, march 2019, nº31 From pop art to the iArt Movement there was only one step, and Vigilante took it with excitement to start playing with the wide range of resources offered by the internet: emails, tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts or including the meta language of these apps. His new creations included a fictional/literary side by creating and adding to pop art the emails that would have been written by renowned figures of classic cinema.

Background On August 29, 2020 at around 12:20pm (UTC+8), nine Moro farmers were shot near a granary along Aringay Road within University of Southern Mindanao (USM) campus in Kabacan, Cotabato by at least five unidentified individuals. All but one died on the sport with the sole survivor dying in a hospital a few hours later. The nine men reportedly were told to alight from their motorcycles by the suspects who proceeded to shoot at the victims using high powered firearms. Perpetrators and motive The perpetrators of the Kabacan massacre are undetermined although what is known is at least five individuals were involved in the killings. The Kabacan Police released a report which concluded that the assailants were equipped with high powered firearms such as M-16 Armalite rifle, Carbine rifle and caliber .45 pistol based from 32 empty shells retrieved from the crime scene. Initially the incident was reported as a rido or clan feud by authorities but it was established that there was no gunfight and that the victims were gunned down by the suspects. The Region 12 office of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) says that the local police might be responsible for the killing citing a \\"dying declaration\\" it retrieved from the relatives of the ninth victim who died in a hospital alleging that police officers were responsible for the incident. Response The Philippine National Police said that the law enforcement agency will be conducting an investagation on the matter.A special task force was formed led by Cotabato Police Provincial Office head Henry Villar heading to a marching order by Cotabato Governor Nancy Catamco to identify and arrest the suspects of the killings. The Philippine Army in Cotabato province also launched its own investigation reasoning that the incident might escalate tensions and hamper its \\"peace and development efforts\\". CHR Region 12 launched its own probe on the incident and has considered the incident as a case of \\"extrajudicial killing\\" and is considering filing charges against the local police. The human rights body said that even if the local police was found not liable for the killings itself, it may consider indicting them for negligence if they find the police's response to the case as inefficient. Bangsamoro Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim also directed Public Order and Safety Minister Hussein Muñoz to form and lead a body tasked to investigate the massacre. He also called on the Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission to conduct its own investigation. The formed PNP task force is aiming to dispel reports that the police is responsible for the killings as \\"fake news\\".

By the second half of the 1920s, he was Montreal's leading art dealer. Life Advertisement in the Montreal Gazette, 1922 Watson was born in 1887 in Freshfield, England. He immigrated to Canada in 1905 and got his first job, with John Ogilvy, a former dry goods merchant who ran an art business as a hobby. He recalled later that they sold contemporary French, English, and Dutch paintings, sent from England by Harry Wallis, an art dealer in London. Watson believed that the art shop of John Ogilvy was the first gallery in Montreal devoted exclusively to art. Watson, who advocated that Ogilvy take on works of Canadian art, was told that they were too noisy to mix with quiet Dutch pictures. However, when Watson's father, Robinson Watson (1851–1920), formerly a prosperous jute merchant in England, established an antique shop in Montreal, Watson discovered that his father's clients could be interested in buying works of art. Having acquired the business of Ogilvy when Ogilvy retired in 1908, he became an art dealer as well as an art critic for the newspapers, with a one-room gallery at the back of his father\`s store. There, Watson sold European and British art, some of it sent to him from the firm of Vicars Brothers of Bond Street, London, England, a firm to which he had been introduced by Ogilvy. Hazel Vicars was Watson's mentor in both art and life. Vicars had fundamental honesty, keen perception, and a positive attitude to life, qualities that Watson admired. In 1921, after his father's death, when Watson's Antique Galleries closed, William Watson opened Watson Art Galleries, which sold art goods exclusively at 679 St. Catherine Street West (St. Catherine and Bishop). In 1932, he moved to 1434 Sherbrooke Street West, where he remained until he retired in 1958. In Paris, Watson bought paintings by Maurice Utrillo among others and purchased many by Eugène Boudin from the firm of Durand-Ruel, which had been the artist's champion. In Canada, Watson was one of the first art dealers to carry and promote Canadian art, becoming friendly in the process with artists such as James Wilson Morrice, Maurice Cullen, Marc-Aurèle de Foy Suzor-Coté, Clarence Gagnon, and William Brymner. He helped these artists, even placing shows at galleries other than his own. In 1914, when he became President of the Montreal Arts Club, he organized one- person shows in the Club of Morrice and Jackson. Other Canadian artists such as Helen McNicoll, found their work praised in the newspaper review he wrote in the Montreal Gazette. The first Canadian painting he sold, in 1906 when he was with Ogilvy, was by Frederick S. Coburn, and he maintained a friendship with Coburn and sold his work, as well as that of Albert H. Robinson, A. Y. Jackson, Emily Carr and Robert Pilot. His ledger books show that Watson was also interested in earlier Canadian art, such as the paintings of Cornelius Krieghoff and Otto Reinhold Jacobi. He also devoted a chapter to locating the work of Krieghoff in his book Retrospective: Recollections of a Montreal Art Dealer. Advertisement in the Montreal Gazette, 1930 Among these artists, he had a special relationship with Cullen, whom he met around 1908 and whose work he began to sell that year and in the years that followed: he held thirteen one-person shows for Cullen from 1923 to 1935. These shows were well attended and a commercial success, which made an immense difference to Cullen. In 1926, Cullen had enough money to move from Montreal and buy a house at Chambly, where he settled with his family, all due to Watson. In 1931, Watson published a book about Cullen, Maurice Cullen, R.C.A.: A Record of Struggle and Achievement. In 1934, he organized a retrospective of Cullen's work. In 1925, after the death of Brymner, he organized a show of All the Remaining Paintings and Water Colors by Brymner, as well as giving a show to Alfred Laliberté. In 1926, he gave one-person exhibitions to Cullen's stepson, Robert Pilot, his first, as well as Robinson and Suzor-Coté. In the period from 1927 to 1929, he gave Suzor-Côté a major exhibition as well as giving three one-person shows to Pilot. In the 1930s, besides Cullen, he showed the work of Pilot in nine one- person shows as well as showing the work of Alex Colville and B.C. Binning. When he closed the Watson Art Gallery in 1958 at seventy-one years of age, Jackson wrote a letter in which he acknowledged Watson's role, writing \\"You have known, and been a good friend to nearly all the artists, and must have happy memories of them.\\"  Personal life, death and legacy  Watson was married to Cécile Bérard. They had two daughters, Claire and Louise. Watson died on March 6, 1973, at the age of 86. His memoir, Retrospective: Recollections of an Art Dealer, was written shortly before his death, edited by his daughters, and published posthumously by the University of Toronto Press in 1974. In the National Post, writer Arnold Edinborough described it as \\"a sunny account of a life lived in the midst of great paintings and among a host of artists who became friends.\\" Watson is credited for his role in encouraging the growth of Canada's art scene. His papers and ledger book are included in the Library and Archives of the National Gallery of Canada.

The Casuchas del Rey or Casuchas de la Cordillera are a string of small mountain shelters made of stone masonry along the route of the Uspallata Pass of the Principal Cordillera in the Andes of Chile and Argentina. The shelters were built to improve the intra-colonial postal system of the Spanish Empire. The shelters were created following the designs of Ambrosio O'Higgins in 1766 at a time when Cuyo was still part of the Captaincy General of Chile. Each shelter had a capacity for about thirthy persons and stock of supplies inside. This included yerba mate as mate was highly valued by those who frequented the cold Andean highlands. Two events are credited to have triggered the construction of the mountain shelters, first O'Higgins near-death while crossing the Andes in 1763 and the Seven Years' War that made improvements to overland communication an imperative as seaborne communications between Buenos Aires and Lima could be intercepted and while the traditional route across Potosí was overly long. German painter Johann Moritz Rugendas crossed the Andes in 1835 following the Casuchas del Rey. The 60 paintings and sketches he made on his way have served to locate the remains of the shelters.

He holds the professorship for life sciences and leads the Lingner Labat the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).  Career  Lingner obtained his PhD from the Biozentrum of the University of Basel in 1992. In 1993 he joined the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at University of Colorado at Boulder for postdoctoral studies under the supervision of Thomas Cech. He then joined Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in Lausanne, Switzerland, first as a junior group leader in 1997 and became senior group leader in 2002. In 2005 he was appointed as associate professor at EPF Lausanne. Since 2009, Lingner is a full professor at EPF Lausanne.  Research  The Lingner Lab studies of the structure, function and maintenance of telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that enable chromosome stability and that regulate cellular lifespan. They elucidated how telomere shortening is counteracted by the telomerase enzyme that renders cancer cells immortal. The lab discovered that telomeres are transcribed into telomeric repeat containing RNA (TERRA), which in turn regulates the telomeric chromatin structure and telomere maintenance by telomerase and homology directed repair.

She learned how to play shogi from her father when she was five years old, and then started attending a shogi school in Kanazawa and receiving instruction from a former appentice professional 3-dan named when she was nine years old. As an elementary school fifth-grade student, Nohara won the 7th in 2014, and then won the same tournament again as a sixth-grade student in 2015. After entering junior high school, Nohara won the 8th in 2016 as a junior high school first year student, and then the 43rd as a junior high school third- year student in 2018. Her victory in 2018 was the first time the tournament had been won by a female. Nohara is the first to win the three years in a row; she won the 49th Amateur Women's Meijin Tournament in 2017, the 50th Amateur Women's Meijin Tournament in 2018 and the 51st Amateur Women's Meijin Tournament in 2019. Women's shogi professional Nohara satisfied the criteria for the rank of women's shogi professional 2-kyū in July 2020 when she defeated Io Murota to advance to the quarterfinals of the 28th . She informed the Japan Shogi Association of her desire to turn professional, and the JSA announced on August 14, 2020, that it had accepted her application and would award her professional status as of September 1, 2020. Since part of the process for becoming a professional means having an existing professional shogi player as a sponsor, Nohara asked Toshiyuki Moriuchi to sponsor her and he agreed. Playing style Nohara has stated that her favorite opening strategy is or the Kamaitachi opening. It is an unorthodox strategy developed by her first shogi teacher Suzuki that can be used regardless of the opening strategy adopted by the opponent. Nohara stated that when she first started studying under Suzuki as an elementary school student she actually preferred the Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook strategy but found that she just could not beat any opponents who were using the Kamaitachi opening; therefore, she began to study the strategy under Suzuki himself. She stated that one of the things that appealed to her about the strategy was that she could look at a random Kamaitachi position and immediately tell it was almost certainly from one of Suzuki's games in contrast to a more traditional shogi opening strategy which may have been used by countless number of professionals over the years.

U.S. Dist. Court ex rel Talk America, 495 F.3d 1062 (2007), is a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals case that examines whether a service provider may change the terms of its service contract by merely posting a revised contract on its website, without informing the other party of the changes. Facts Joe Douglas contracted for long distance telephone service with America Online. Talk America subsequently acquired this business from AOL and continued to provide telephone service to AOL's former customers. Talk America then added four provisions to the service contract: (1) additional service charges; (2) a class action waiver; (3) an arbitration clause; and (4) a choice-of-law provision pointing to New York law. Talk America posted the revised contract on its website but, according to Douglas, it never notified him that the contract had changed. Unaware of the new terms, Douglas continued using Talk America's services for four years. After becoming aware of the additional charges, Douglas filed a class action lawsuit in district court, charging Talk America with violations of the Federal Communications Act, breach of contract and violations of various California consumer protection statutes. Talk America moved to compel arbitration based on the modified contract and the district court granted the motion. Because the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 16, does not authorize interlocutory appeals of a district court order compelling arbitration, Douglas petitioned for a writ of mandamus. Judgment The trial court granted defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. The court also found that the additional clauses in the revised contract were enforceable as a matter of law. Douglas petitioned for writ of mandamus. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Plaintiff’s petition for writ of mandamus. On review, the court determined that Plaintiff was not bound by the terms of the revised contract. The court reasoned that the new contract terms constituted an offer and were not binding unless properly accepted. The Plaintiff did not accept the offer because “an offeree cannot assent to an offer unless he knows of its existence.” Significance The ruling examines whether a service provider may change the terms of its service contract by merely posting a revised contract on its website.

While stained glass had been used in French churches in the Romanesque period, the Gothic windows were much larger, eventually filling entire walls. They were particularly important in the High Gothic cathedrals, most famously in Chartres Cathedral. Their function was to fill the interior with a mystical colored light, representing the Holy Spirit, and also to illustrate the stories of the Bible for the large majority of the congregation who could not read. The rose window was a particularly important feature of the major French cathedrals, beginning with Notre Dame de Paris. It was usually found over the portals on the west front, and frequently also on the transepts. Over the years of the Gothic period, the windows became larger and larger, allowing in more light through grisaille glass, and the details on the painted glass became much finer, gradually resembling paintings. A large part of the original glass was destroyed in the centuries after the Middle Ages; much of the glass today is restored or a more modern replacement.  Early Gothic (12th- early 13th centuries)  = Basilica of Saint Denis = File:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 19.jpgBasilica of Saint-Denis, Apse, axial chapel, The Annonciation, with Abbot Suger, the patron, depicted at the feet of the Virgin.

The Tree of Jesse window is on the right File:Vitrail Arbre de Jessé Saint- Denis 27122017 3.jpgDetail of the Tree of Jesse window, Baslica of Saint- Denis (1140–44) Only a very small amount of original 12th-century French stained glass remains. Much of it was destroyed, and replaced in the 19th century. The early windows were assemblages of very small pieces of glass, often of different thicknesses, often painted, which could only be seen from a distance. Their principal effect was their characteristic of constantly changing, depending upon the exterior light of the moment. The first important Gothic structure in France was the royal Basilica of Saint Denis (now the Cathedral of Saint Denis), the traditional sepulchre of the French Kings located just outside Paris. The Abbot Suger, a close advisor of the French King, who directed the government during the King's absence during the Crusades, rebuilt the ambulatory with Gothic rib vaults primarily to create greater space for stained glass windows. The medieval French church, Following the doctrine of Saint Augustine, associated light with the power of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Suger was an admirer of the doctrines of the early Christian philosopher John Scotus Eriugena (c.810-87) and Dionysus, or the Pseudo-Areopagite, who taught that light was a divine manifestation, and that all things were \\"material lights\\", reflecting the infinite light of God himself. For Suger, stained glass became a way to create a glowing, unworldly light ideal for religious reflection. Suger described the finished work at Saint-Denis as \\"a circular string of chapels, by virtue of which the whole church would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty\\". This continued to be the guiding reason for stained glass windows throughout the Gothic period. Pierre de Roissy, a dignitary of the Chapter of Chartres Cathedral, wrote in about 1200 that the stained glass windows being installed in the nave \\"would transmit the clarity of the sunlight, signifying the Holy Scriptures, which push evil away from us, as they illuminate us.\\" One window at Saint-Denis illustrated the patron himself, Abbot Suger, at the feet of the Virgin Mary. The Abbey also had a Tree of Jessé window, depicting the genealogy of Christ, which became a common feature at Gothic cathedrals for the next century. The early Gothic windows each had a theme or subject, such as \\"The Passion of Christ\\", illustrated by dozens of individual medallions. In a tall lancet windows, there were one or two medallions on each level, three at the most. each no larger than s square meter. The circular medallions were separated by wide horders with geometric or floral decoration. The story of the window could be read from medallion to medallion, usually from the bottom to the top. The subject matter was not chosen by the artist, but by the ecclesiastical authorities of the Cathedral. They illustrated the lives of the Saints and Christian martyrs, and the episodes of the New and Old Testament, for the large part of the congregation which could not read. Many windows included panels illustrating the work of the guild, such as the masons or bakers, which had financed them. =Chartres Cathedral early period (12th c.)= File:Vitrail Chartres-049 rectifié - g.jpgTop of the Tree of Jessé Window, Chartres Cathedral (1150) Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpgDetail of the stained glass window called Notre-Dame de la Belle Verierre File:Chartres cathedral 2857.jpgChartres Cathedral, Passion of Christ windows, (c. 1150) A few important examples of 12th century windows are found at Chartres Cathedral on the inside of the western facade, in three lancet windows under the rose window. These windows survived a devastating fire in the Cathedral in 1194, and are considered some of the best examples of 12th century work in France. They introduced the famous Chartres blue, glass colored with Cobalt(II) oxide, which cooled and balanced the vivid reds and yellows of the windows. Each of the windows also contains a medallion which illustrates its donors; the butchers for the Miracle of the Virgin Window, the water-carriers for the story of Mary Magdalene window. The Cathedral also has an early Tree of Jessé windows, illustrating the genealogy of Christ in the shape of a family tree imagined in a dream by the prophet Jesse.  High Gothic and Rayonnant (13th century)  The development of the rib vault and the flying buttress resulted in cathedrals that were higher and higher, with less need for thick walls and greater space for windows. The intermediate levels of the walls, occupied by galleries during the Romanesque period, were merged together and given windows. As a result, the upper walls between the buttresses were gradually filled with larger and larger windows. The changes in architecture were accompanied by technical and artistic innovations in the making of the stained glass. The small early Gothic windows with their deep, rich colors were replaced by much larger and thinner windows that allowed in more light. They had simpler, more geometric designs and the figures more expressive faces, that could be visible from far below. The space around the figures was often left white or in grisaille, or decorated with vegetal or floral designs. Pale yellows and ochres, made with Silver stain (which gives the name to \\"stained glass\\"), became more common. and colors were more nuanced. = Chartres Cathedral later period (13th century) = File:Westfenster Chartres.jpgWest rose window and lancets, Chartres Cathedral File:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral.jpgSouth rose window, Chartres Cathedral (1221-1230) File:Chartres Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres Innen Südrosette 3.jpgDetail of the south rose window, Chartres File:Chartres - cathédrale - rosace nord.jpg Chartres north rose window Following the destruction of a large portion of the Cathedral in 1194, a major fund-raising campaign began to rebuilt it. The King of France contributed, as did his English enemy, Richard the Lion-Hearted. So did the merchants and guilds of Chartres, who sponsored new windows. The new cathedral was almost finished in the remarkably short time of twenty-five years, though it was not re-consecrated until 1260. As a result, the stained glass has a remarkable unity of style, exemplified by the windows of the nave, and particularly by the north and south rose windows, with their delicate balance of reds and blues. In Chartres, thanks to the additional support provided by the new flying buttresses, the walls were made into a series of bays, each with a small rose window above and two lancet windows below. Over the coming years in other cathedrals, such as Amiens in 1220,the space between the windows in each bay was gradually reduced until the windows occupied much of he wall. The rebuilding also included the creation of two large new rose windows in the transepts. After reconstruction, Chartres had one hundred sixty windows and three rose windows, making the windows a dominant feature of the architecture. So many windows were created for new cathedrals in the early 12th century that multiple workshops, in different styles, were sometimes employed on the same Cathedral. Three different workshops were at work at Bourges Cathedral between 1210 and 1215. This marked the beginning of the High Gothic, or \\"Classique\\" style of French Gothic architecture and stained glass. = Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle = File:Sainte Chapelle 01.JPGDevil kidnapping a woman, Sainte-Chapelle pane (mid-13th c.) (Now in Museum of Middle Ages, Paris) File:Puhane Sainte Chapelle.jpgUpper windows File:Sud Baie détail roi.jpgDetail of South Bay window; the King Between about 1225-1230, a new style began to appear in the Ile-de-France and other regions, which was seen in architecture, sculpture and painting as well as stained glass. It was more graphic, more summary, with simplified forms, presented rigid stylisation of faces while the robes and clothing became more realistic. Historians later gave the period the name Rayonnant. Important early examples include the west rose window of Notre Dame de Paris, the chapel of the Virgin of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (destroyed in the 18th century, but some of the glass was preserved). The most important and influential work in this style is the upper royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle (1234-1244), built for Louis IX to display his recently acquired collection of sacred relics. The single chapel contains 670 square meters of stained glass, not counting the later west rose window, and the walls, 20.4 meters high under the vault, appear entirely to made of glass. This was made possible by moving the supports of the wall, clusters of nine colonettes, to the exterior. In addition, the windows were supported by two series of iron bars, at mid-height and at the summit. The iron support bars are concealed by the bars of the tracery. Other metal supports for the windows are hidden under the eaves of the roof. The iron bars of the window tracery formed trilobs, quadrilles, medallions, and other geometric shapes framing each scene. Because of this complex network, of frames, each panel was very small; the figures at the upper levels are nearly impossible to discern. The important figures and scenes are placed in additional quadrilateral settings of mosaic-like decoration, dominated by red and blue colors. Similar red-blue quadrilateral designs set off the images of heraldic shields, images of the castles of Castille, and especially the royal emblems, the Fleurs-des-Lis. The upper chapel has fifteen windows, composed of 1,113 panels of glass. Nearly two- thirds of the glass is original. Unlike the windows of most Gothic cathedrals, where the windows were primarily devoted to the lives of the Saints and Apostles, the windows of Sainte-Chapelle were primarily devoted to the relics preserved in the Chapel; fragments believed to be from the True Cross and the Crown of Thorns from the Crucifixion of Christ. The windows depicted the history of the Hebrew people, and finally connected the Biblical Kings with the reign of the window's patron, Louis IX. The King was depicted in the windows carrying the crown of Christ. The windows of Sainte-Chapelle are believed to have been made by three different workshops, with slightly different styles. Some seem to have been influenced by new developments in illuminated manuscripts. The designs of the glass displayed rich decoration, an elegance of figures and a precision of gestures not seen before in stained glass. The Sainte-Chapelle window styles found an immediate echo in the windows of other 13th century cathedrals and churches, notably Soissons Cathedral, made shortly after Sainte-Chapelle, likely by the same artists. = Notre Dame de Paris = File:Gothic-Rayonnant Rose-6.jpgNorth rose window of Notre Dame de Paris (about 1250) File:Paris Cathédrale Notre-Dame Innen Südliche Rosette 6.jpgDetail of the south rose window File:Notre-Dame de Paris.jpgDetail of window from St. George's chapel, Notre Dame de Paris (13th c.) Other major examples of Rayonnant stained glass are the great north and south rose windows of the transept of Notre-Dame de Paris, whose construction was sponsored by King Louis IX of France. = Saint-Denis = Another influential group rayonnant windows was created for the Basilica of Saint- Denis by Suger's successor, the Abbot Eudes Clement. He preserved the original windows in the disambulatory, but reconstructed the central sanctuary and built a large new transept to replace the Carolingian nave. The new nave and transept had two important innovations. First, the traditional piers that supported the roof were replaced by pillars which grouped together colonettes. These collonettes connected directly with the pained arches of the vaults. Second, as a result the pointed arches of the windows could entirely fill the upper wall. Two very large rose window entirely filled the upper ends of the north and south transepts. The rebuilt abbey was consecrated in 1281. The design of the Sant-Denis window, created by the radiating stone mullions, later gave the new style is name, \\"Rayonnant\\". = Northern and western France = File:Troyes (10) Basilique Saint-Urbain Vitrail de la Crucifixion.jpgWindows of Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes File:Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes, Interior, South-West 140509 2.jpgWest window of Troyes Cathedral File:Vitrail Cathédrale Troyes 150208 01.jpgWindows of Troyes Cathedral About 1270) File:Châlons Cathédrale Verrière axiale 1.jpgCrucifixion, Chalons Cathedral in Champagne 1230-1237) File:Le Bon Samaritain amène le blessé à l'hospice.jpgThe Good Samaritain, Sens Cathedral (13th century) The Cathedrals of Amiens, Troyes, Reims and Chalons-sur-Marne in northern France were among the first to adapt the new Rayonnant window styles, alongside windows in the earlier 1200 style. The new windows of Troyes Cathedral in the Champagne region featured intense colors. The figures in the windows of the Cathedral of Chalons-sur-Marne (1240-45) detached themselves from the unified background. The windows of Reims Cathedral (1240-45) depicted the apostles atop edicules depicting the churches and bishops of Champagne. In western France, the change in style came later, not beginning until 1245-1250. At Le Mans Cathedral, the windows became more geometric, and the figures were reduced in size. Between 1255 and 1260 another new tendency appeared in French windows; large panels surrounding the colored figures were filled with grisaille, or grey or white glass. In the south, in Clermont-Ferrand, window- makers continued to used small panes of glass of a single color, while in other cathedrals, such as Tours Cathedral, multiple colors appeared in the same pane. Gradually, most new churches began to follow a uniform theme; the upper windows of the choir used solid colors, with the exception of the windows over the choir, whee the figures were surrounded by grisaille. Throughout France, The figures also evolved toward the style of mannerism. During the period of 1255-60, The windows began to follow the style used in the royal manuscripts painted after the return from captivity of Louis IX. In the second part of the 13th century, the grisaille portions were animated by quadrille panes illustrating biblical stories, and bordered with delicate foliage. The figures were presented with their heads half-turned, the figures made highly expressive gestures. The new lighter colors and mannerist figures influenced windows beyond France. The Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes built by Urban IV beginning in 1262 at his birthplace, was a good example of the new style. Forty years later, in the 14th century, with the introduction of silver stain in the Ile-de-France and Normandy, the stained glass windows ceased to be mosaics of different colors, and came much closer to paintings, with equal luminosity throughout.  Early Flamboyant style (14th century)  File:Verrière de la cathédrale Saint-Gatien de Tours DSC 0772.jpgWindows of Tours Cathedral (14th century) File:Baie 214 (Notre-Dame, Évreux).JPGWindow of Evreux Cathedral (14th century) File:Baie chœur 19 Saint-Ouen Rouen Becket.JPGThomas Becket window at Saint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen File:Baie chœur 19 Saint-Ouen Rouen Becket 2.JPGDetail of the Thomas Becket window,Saint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen, with architectural settings File:Troyes Cathédrale Saint-Pierre- et-Saint-Paul Baie 223 448.jpgGrisaille windows at Troyes Cathedral File:Sens Cathédrale St-Étienne Baie 014 176.jpg14th century glass in Sens Cathedral In the Fourteenth century France was engaged in the Hundred Years War with England, and also faced a series of deadly epidemics of the Plague. The royal government, occupied with the war, reduced is patronage of the arts. Nonetheless creation of stained glass continued, with continuous innovations, particularly of more grisaille to make the windows lighter, and more extensive use of silver stain and painting upon the glass. Much of the innovation took place in Normandy, at Rouen Cathedral and Evreux Cathedral. The earliest examples of using grisaille in upper windows existing today are from 1260-1270, in the high choir of Tours Cathedral, and on the upper level of the Chevet in Troyes cathedral. Other examples appeared in the clerestory windows of Chartres Cathedral. The upper part of the Choir of Chartres was pulled down in 1270 and rebuilt in the new style, with larger windows. The windows were finished by about 1300. Following the new style, a large part of the space surrounding the figures was filled with grisaille. Other signs of the changing style appeared in the nave windows; the richness of colors of the early Chartres windows was still there, but the ornate medallions disappeared, and elaborate canopies and arches, similar to the architecture of the church, were placed over the figures to highlight them. This became a common characteristic of the flamboyant. Each vertical section of window usually contained two tall figures, one over the other, surrounded by grisaille. At Evreux Cathedral, whose windows date from the whole span of the 14th century, the figures often include small colored panels showing the donors of the windows with their patron saints. The decoration is largely made up of heraldry and variations of the fleur-de-lis design. Other early examples appear at the Saint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen, which has one of the best collections of 14th century glass in France. Its windows include the Thomas Becket window, illustrating the martyrdom of that Saint. Like other windows of the period, much of the window is grisaille, allowing in a maximum of light, while the figures are framed by elaborate architectural detail, matching the ornate architecture of the church itself. The Flamboyant windows gradually abandoned mosaic-like appearance of the early stained glass windows, and came more and more to resemble paintings. One distinctive feature of the flamboyant was a curvilinear design of the stone mullions within the arched top of windows which, with some imagination, resembled flames agitated by the wind. This design gave the style its name, flamboyant. It had two components; the upper element, called the soufflet, which resembled an elongated four-leaf clover; which was flanked by two mouchettes, undulating spindle-shaped forms decorated with cusps in designs. Variations of this design were found at the top of many flamboyant windows. The use of a light-coloured grisaille, and then a white background, became more and more common in the 14th century. Windows became more refined and had a broader range of colors. The walls of Cathedral interior were increasingly covered with dense tracery and decoration, competing with the windows. The figures in the windows were often surrounded by white glass to frame them and make them stand out. Superimposed medallions, in a form called \\"Legendaire\\", became a common feature. Lancet windows became another common feature of the windows. Instead of having multiple figures, lancet windows had only a single figure, surrounded by white. The quality of the glass became much better in the Fourteenth century, due to improvements in the materials and the process of glass-blowing. The white glass became lighter and more translucent. A new technique was introduced, adding a thin layer of colored enamel paint to the outside of the windows. This could be delicately scraped with a stone instrument to give relief and variation to the color. The process of silver staining also was developed. The outside of the glass would have coloring of silver stain, while the artist painted the figures on the inside. The artist could employ several different colors and shades on a single pane of glass. The techniques of painting on the glass also improved. Figures became more realistic and more refined, as the artists followed the style of the illuminators of manuscripts. A new phase, called International Gothic, appeared in Europe in about 1360, as styles and innovations were shared between countries. One source of new ideas in France was court of the Popes in Avignon, installed in 1309. The court helped introduce Renaissance artistic ideas such as realism and perspective into French art, including stained glass. Another important change to French stained glass took place in the 14th century. This was a change in the narrative style of the window. Prior to the 13th century, windows were of with dozens of scenes from the life of a Saint or martyr, showing all the episodes of his life. In the 14th century, windows began to concentrate on one single important of the martyr's life, in a larger scale. Another innovation of the 14th century was the use of a medallion illustrating the donor of the window. Some donors had several medallions dedicated to them, and one, Raoul de Ferrieres, had an entire lancet window at Evreux Cathedral dedicated to him.  Later Flamboyant (15th century)  File:Chorapsisfenster Saint-Séverin Paris.jpgWindow of Saint-Séverin Paris (15th century) File:Paris - MNMA Vitrail SC 03.jpgJoseph and his brothers, Saint-Chapelle (15th century) File:Paris Sainte-Chapelle Innen Oberkirche Rosette 2.jpgRose window of Sainte-Chapelle (1485-98) File:Vitrail Sainte Chapelle.jpgDetail of the rose window of Sainte-Chapelle - the Apocalypse (1485-98) File:Rose window of Sainte-Chapelle (Paris) - Vision of 7 candlesticks.jpgDrawing of Center of the rose window of Sainte-Chapelle - vision of the Seven Candlesticks (c. 1485) (see photo at left) File:PM 093496 F Evreux.jpgApse chapel of Evreux Cathedral (restored after World War II) File:Vitrail Cathédrale d'Evreux 220209 08.jpgDetail of Evreux Cathedral window (15th c., restored) File:Rouen Église Saint-Maclou Innen Langhaus Rosette 2.jpgRose window of Church of Saint-Maclou, Rouen File:Vitraux de l'Abbatiale Saint Ouen.JPGFlamboyant windows of the nave of the royal abbey- church of Saint-Ouen, Rouen (early 16th c.) In the early 15th century, very little new stained glass was made in France; the country was in the midst of the Hundred Years war, preoccupied the disastrous defeat at Agincourt, the conquest of France by Henry V of England, and the liberation by Joan of Arc. emerging from the destruction and ruin of the Hundred Years War. Not until the English were expelled did French architecture regain its important position. In the second half of the 15th century, the art of stained glass revived dramatically in France, and approached closer and closer to that of painting, with the use of perspective and other painterly techniques. But before long France gradually lost its dominance, as International Gothic style, particularly in Germany and Flanders rose in prominence. The work of the Flemish Van Eyck brothers became the inspiration for windows across Europe. The general characteristics of French stained glass in this period include whole panels filled with decorative canopy work, almost all in white, with just touches of stain. The canopy designs were intricate patterns of line and form to accompany the intricate details of the Flamboyant interiors. An important innovation was the borrowing of methods of early Renaissance painting. In some cases the figures of th windows completely crossed the dividing mullions, occupying more than one panel of glass. In the 15th century, the names of stained glass artists became known, and artists began to travel from city to city to make windows. Stained glass workshops were located in the major European cities, and began to dedicate more and more of their time to the maintenance of existing windows. The makers of stained glass makers were declared exempt from taxes at the end of the 15th century by King Charles V of France. Stained glass artists also began to have a wider variety of clients; not only Kings, but also wealthy aristocrats and merchants. Windows were made not only for Cathedrals, but for also for town halls and palatial residences. The Duc Jean de Berry, brother of King Charles V, commissioned stained glass windows for his residence in Bourges. As paper became more common, drawings of prominent windows circulated around Europe, and the same design could be used in several different cities. Important windows made in France during this period include the rose window on the west facade of Sainte-Chapelle (1485-98), which used paint on glass with exceptional realism and fantasy to depict the Apocalypse. the Church of Saint Severin in Paris is another example. Rouen was an important center for making late Gothic glass; aexceptional collection of windows from this period is found at the Church of Saint-Maclou in Rouen. = Bourges Cathedral = File:Bourges - Cathédrale - Vitraux -105.jpgBourges Cathedral, window of the Apostles (15th century) File:Bourges - Cathédrale - Vitraux -85.jpgBourges Cathedral, Scenes from the life of Saint Denis (15th century) File:Bourges - Cathédrale - Vitraux -51.jpgBourges Cathedral, Chapel of Jacques Coeur, The Announciation (1448-1450) Bourges, under The Duke Jean du Berry, the brother of King Charles V of France, was a major center for stained glass in the 15th century. It had its own Sainte-Chapelle, which was destroyed in the French Revolution. A few of the windows survived, and were reinstalled in Bourges Cathedral in the 19th century. Following the style of the 15th century, the windows frequently portrayed the figures of saints and patrons against a dark background, while the higher parts of the windows were filled with very elaborate arches and other architectural features, usually in white, which fit with the interior decoration of the church.  Transition to Renaissance (16th century)  File:Vitraux de la nef.JPG16th century windows in Nave at Troyes Cathedral File:Vitraux Cathédrale de Troyes 290308 02.jpg 16th century windows at Troyes Cathedral File:Dreux Saint-Pierre baie 005 328.JPG16th century window in church Saint-Pierre de Dreux  The Patrons  Windows were very expensive to make, and most cathedral windows were financed by donors, ranging from Kings and nobles to the craftsmen of the guilds of the city. King Louis IX directly financed the rose windows at Notre-Dame de Paris and all of the windows at Sainte-Chapelle, which are filled with symbols of his reign. The first stained glass window to portray its patron is at the Basilica of Saint Denis, where an image of the Abbot Suger is shown at the feet of Christ. But later in the 12th and 13th century, the practice became very common. The patrons were frequently pictured in the windows that they funded, either praying, or, in the case of the craft guilds, shown at work. Windows depicted bakers, butchers, tanners, furriers, money-changers, and other professions at work. The rose window of the south transept of Chartres Cathedral contains the coats of arms of its patron, Peter I, Duke of Brittany, in the trefoil of the rose and the central lancet, along with portraits of his wife and his son and daughter, kneeling.

The walls of glass corresponded with the walls of the celestial city, ornamented with jewels, and filled with divine light, as it was described in the Book of Revelation. The scenes within the windows were full of symbols. A panel of workers with a background or frame of elaborate arches and columns indicated that they were not in an ordinary workshop, but laboring in a celestial workshop. Even the decorative elements had a meaning. The climbing ivy which surrounded many of the scenes represented the renewal of the Garden of Eden on earth. The Apostles and Saints were generally portrayed with objects associated with them, so viewers could recognise them, in the same fashion as Gothic sculptures. A female figure with a crown represented the Church. A seraphim or angel putting away a sword represented either the Angel who guards the gates of paradise, or the peace made between God and man by the atonement of the Crucifixion.  Technique  = Making the Glass = The technique of making stained glass windows in the early Gothic was essentially the same as in the Romanesque period. The glass was made at a separate site, usually near a forest, where abundant firewood for melting the glass was available. One variety of the process was described in detail at the beginning of the 12th century by the monk Theophile in a tract called \\"Schedula Diversarum Artium\\" or \\"Treatise on the Diverse Arts\\". In the technique described by Theophile, called \\"By Manchon\\", the ingredients, a mixture of two thirds vegetal ashes, which provided potassium, was combined with a third of river sand, which provided silicon. This method was most commonly used for making bottles and glasses. The glass was blown at the end of a tube into a spherical bubble, which while hot was rolled into a cylinder shape. While it was still hot, the ends were then cut off the cylinder, and it was flattened with a wooden spatula into a flat rectangle. The French used a variation of this plan, called \\"Plateau\\" or \\"Cive\\" glass. In this method the glass was first blown into a bubble, as in the preceding method. Then, while the bubble was still hot, a second tube was inserted at the other end of the bubble, and the first tube was detached. The glass was continually rotated and gradually pushed and flattened into a circular disk or plate, with a slight rise in the center where the tube had been inserted. The colors were created by adding metal oxides; usually iron oxide, copper and manganese, to the molten glass. Cobalt created the famous blue of the Chartres windows. Copper could make a yellow, a green or a blue. Red was the most difficult color to make, since the red coloring let very little light pass through. In this case, the hot blown glass was dipped into vessel containing red colorant, which fused to the glass. Near the end of the 13th century glass makers began to add layers of different colors to the glass, which could then be ground or engraved away to achieve more varied shades and combinations of color. Gradually the glass colors became more and more like the colors used in painting. =Making the window = The first step in the making the window was the design, a colored drawing about one-tenth of full size, made for the approval of the master builder and the patron of the windows. This plan showed the design of the lead and iron framework that held the glass together, and the colors of each piece. The peintre verrier, or glass painter, selected the colors, choosing from small sample colored pieces provided by the glassmaker. Once the plan was approved, An exsct copy of the plan, in full size, was drawn in charcoal on the top of a large table covered with plaster. The position and color of each piece was noted and numbered. Copies of each section of the window, showing each piece of glass, were carefully traced and given to the terrier, or glassmaker. He carefully cracked off the pieces he needed from larger pieces of colored glass, using a heated iron tool in the early period, and a diamond cutter in the later period. = Painting the window = File:Paris MNMA Vitrail Samson 668.JPGPainted details of Sampson and the lion, from Sainte-Chapelle (now in the National Museum of the Middle Ages, Paris The painter would add details of clothing and faces and other details. The \\"paint\\" in early Gothic was an enamel, a mixture of iron oxide or copper oxide powder with water and gum arabic that made a dark brown or grey. It was more or less diluted to vary its transparency. The color was mixed with \\"soft\\" glass, a kind of glass with a low-melting point, which would allow the mixture to be fused directly with the glass of the windows. The painters placed the window section on an open easel placed before a window,or put the glass flat onto a transparent table, so the artist could see the effect of the light coming through the glass. Once the painting of a pane was finished, it was baked at 600 degrees celsius to fix the color. In Flamboyant period, artists developed the use of matt shading, which allowed the creation of shadows and the appearance of three dimensions. This was done by putting a layer of semi- transparent enamel over the whole surface of the glass, and, when it was dry, but before it was fired, using a small stiff hog's hair brush to brush out the graded lights and half-tones. This allowed much greater realism and detail, and moved stained glass art even closer to painting. =Assembly= The pieces were then trimmed, and then fit into the slots of thin lead strips that held them together. Gaps between the glass and lead were filled with resin, and the edges were sealed with wax. The lead strips were soldered together to complete the panel. The window was then placed into the bay of the wall, and secured with iron bars fixed into the masonry.

This was the ingredient the gave rise to the term \\"stained glass\\". The stain was applied on the outside face the window, while the details were painted on the inside. Silver stain was used produce a range of colors from yellow to orange and brown shades. It could produce green, if painted onto blue glass. This made it possible to give greater nuances to colors and shades. Small touches could give a particular brilliance to the window; a gold color in windows was usually created with silver stain. Silver stain had been used in Egypt as early as the 8th century to color vases, and was adapted by Arab artists and introduced into Spain. It was first used in Normandy in about 1300 and in England in 1310. With the use of silver stain, the windows gradually lost the appearance of a mosaic of colored glass pieces. and increasingly looked like illustrations of illuminated manuscripts. = Flashed glass = At the end of the 13th century, window artists also applied additional layers of colored glass to their windows, then engraved the upper layers to reveal the colors beneath. This provided even more subtle and delicate shades, and gradually moved the art of stained glass closer and closer to that of painting. But it also destroyed some of the purity and mystical quality of the earlier stained glass, where the color was provided entirely by light passing through glass.  Color  File:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 11.jpg12th century glass, the Burning Bush from the Life of Moses, at Basilica of Saint-Denis (12th century) File:Chartres - Vitrail de la Vie de saint Appolinaire -2.JPGGrisaille and silver stain (used for the gold color) in window from Chartres Cathedral (13th century) File:Rouen Abbatiale Saint-Ouen Innen Chorfenster 2.jpgSaint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen (completed 15th century) had a full range e of colors, set against a white background. In the 12th century early Gothic, The dominant colors were a deep and rich blue, and a ruby red. The colors were often uneven and streaky, but the intensity of the color, particularly in the small windows, was greater than in later windows. These colors were used for all of the backgrounds of the figures, and were rarely painted upon. The enamel paints were used mostly for the decoration of white and other paler glass. Only in the early 13th century did the artists begin covering the blue backgrounds with painted designs. White glass was used sparingly, like a thread woven into the design. In the 13th and 14th centuries, a wider variety of colors and shades became available, through the use of grisaille, silver stain and flashing. The colors were more consistent, but less rich and deep as the ear Gothic colors. Part of this resulted from optics; in the dark churches of the 12th century, the colors of the small windows, with their thick glass, and greater contrast and seemed more vivid. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the artists concentrated the colors in the figures, to make them stand out against the light backgrounds.  Tracery  File:Cathédrale de Chartres - rosace ouest, extérieur.JPGPlate tracery. Early Gothic plate tracery, west rose window of Chartres Cathedral (12th century) File:Paris Cathédrale Notre- Dame Nördliches Querschiff.jpgRayonnant north rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris (13th century) File:Paris Sainte-Chapelle Rosette 1.jpgFlamboyant west rose window of Sainte-Chapelle (late 15th century) As the windows became larger and larger, this led to the development of tracery, a network of stone ribs or mullions, reinforced by iron bars, that framed the lights, or sections of glass. Early Gothic windows were small, and each light was set into a separate opening of the stone wall. This was called Plate tracery, and it was used most famously in the Early Gothic rose window of Chartres Cathedral. By the end of the 12th century, as the windows became larger, it was necessary to devise a new system to give the glass greater resistance to the wind. Each panel of glass was inserted into a framework, originally of wood, later of iron bars, placed at right angles. An example is the Tree of Jessé window at Saint-Denis (see image above). The larger rose windows of the 13th century, particularly those of Chartres Cathedral and Notre-Dame de Paris, required a different kind of tracery. The mullions and bars were modified into curvilinear forms, outlining the panels of the glass, creating elaborate designs within the window. The mullions of Notre-Dame de Paris spread outwards from the center like the rays of the sun, giving Rayonnant style its name. In later Gothic the tracery frames, seen from the outside, merged with the tracery decoration of the Cathedral facades.

The village witnessed violence between Dalits and the upper castes during 1948, 1964 and 1989 and was also known for it's caste based discrimination. Protests started in 2008 campaigning to demolish the wall led mostly by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and left-wing organizations. Later a small potion of the wall was demolished by the government to allow entry to the Dalits to access the main road. Many upper caste villagers left the village and moved 3 kms away with their belongings reportedly as a protest for demolishing the wall. 70 houses belonging to the Dalits were attacked on October 2008 reportedly in retaliation for the demolition of the wall and a Dalit man was shot dead by the police. Tensions continued till 2015 during a clash between both the communities where several vehicles were set on fire and many were hospitalized.  Background  = Caste divisions and clashes = The Village of Uthapuram in the Madurai district has two major castes, the upper caste Pillai and the Dalit Pallar caste. The village was known for it's caste tensions and there was violent conflicts between the castes during the years 1948, 1964 and 1989. = Caste discrimination = The upper caste villagers reportedly blocked attempts of the Dalits to build a bus stop and increased the elevation of a parapet close to the bus stop to discourage the Dalits from sitting before them. The tea- shops managed by caste Hindus are not visited by the Dalits. The Dalits are not permitted to enter an upper caste-dominated streets and are refused space in the community halls and in the village squares and were also denied entry to burial sites. = The wall = The wall which was 600 meters long and 12 ft high was described in variously as a caste wall, a wall of shame, a wall of bias and a wall of untouchability, was built by caste-Hindus in 1989 after a caste violence in the village. The passes through areas intended for common use by members of all the castes. It also barred Dalits from directly entering the main road. Dalits have to use a circular path and walk a some more miles to get to the main road.  Clashes and protests in 2008  The fourth conflict began in 2008 after a period of 20 years, and kept going in numerous ways for another 5 years. It began in April 2008 when the caste Hindus used iron rods to electrify the 600 meter wall to prevent the Dalits from entering into the upper caste areas during night times. Initially, the Dalits were hesitant to contend but the Tamilnadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF), Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), Communist Party of India (CPI) and All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) opposed this action by the upper caste villagers vigorously. A member of the TNUEF alleged that two cows were electrocuted by the electrified wall. Following the state-wide protests of the progressive organisations, the electricity minister of Tamil Nadu called for the removal of the power line. The CPI(M) along with local Dalits started a campaign for the destruction of the caste wall. The Dalits orchestrated a demonstration at the front of the Taluk office calling for the wall to be pulled down. The CPI(M)'s general secretary, N. Varadarajan said that his party cadre will demolish the wall on their own if the government did not take any actions.  Demolition  On 6 May, the district administration got involved and destroyed a 15 foot portion of the wall to allow the Dalits to travel in the presence of a few hundred policemen and the supervision of the district officials. In an act of protest, some caste Hindus returned their ration cards to the Tehsildar. About 600 upper caste members left the village during the demolition and moved to Thalaiyoothu, a place 3 km from the village with their livestock and declared that they would not return. The problem became tense again when the upper caste villagers who left the village didn't listen to a request from the District Collector to come back soon so that everyone in the village can live in peace. When district officials met with them, they made several demands including a patta for a temple where they had been worshiping for more than 400 years, a permanent police outpost in the village,and new housing for people whose residences which they claimed were destroyed by Dalit anti-socials during the riots of 1989. At Thalaiyoothu on May 12, The leader of the village's Upper caste group, told Frontline that his people left the village more out of panic than as a mark of rebellion. After the wall was taken down, he said they felt insecure. He claimed the Dalits live better now with most of them having government jobs or being land owners. He also claimed that since the Dalits were actually on a buying spree and the upper caste members fear that they might be forced to sell their property to Dalits. He also claimed that the wall was built to protect the upper caste villagers. However this version is not accepted by the village's Dalits. They assert they were at the receiving side of hostility, instead of the other way around.  Attacks  On 1 October 2008, more than 70 Dalits houses were attacked as a response to the destruction of the wall and a Dalit youth was shot dead by the police as a result of the tensions on November 4, 2008.  Continued tensions  On 10th November 2011, several Dalits entered a temple controlled by upper caste with police protection. Although several upper caste members welcomed them with folded arms, there were women crying in the streets opposing their entry. In 2012, the Dalits were not allowed to participate in the temple's consecration ceremony and in 2013 the Dalits did not attend the temple festivals. In April 2014, the upper caste villagers locked the temple and left the village opposing the High court order for allowing the Dalits for Temple entry. On October 2015, the Dalits and the upper caste villagers clashed during a temple festival which started over a dispute over placing a garland over a tree. Six motor-bikes were set ablaze and the tehsildars vehicle was also damaged. The police filed cases on 70 people belonging to both the castes and arrested 21. Several injured during the clashes were hospitalized.

Accessed 2 Sept. 2020. The goal of Symple is to control the largest amount of territory on the board with the fewest groups. Like Go, Symple is played on a 19x19 grid of lines, although the game can be played on the squares of a checkered board as well, and there is no capture. Symple is a drawless finite perfect information game for which an opening advantage for either player cannot be argued successfully. Freeling considers it to be one of his six most important games along with Dameo, Emergo, Grand Chess, Storisende, and Sygo.  Rules  = Movement = Each player has one of two color stones, one darker and one lighter, often black and white. The game set up starts with an empty board. Each turn a player must either: # Grow all of their groups of stones or... # Put a stone on a vacant cell unconnected to any other friendly group. A group is defined as any one or more stones connected orthogonally (up, down, left, or right) with no spaces in between. Groups are grown by placing a single stone on a space orthogonally adjacent to any stone within a group. Each group may only grow by one stone per turn. If a stone connects two or more different groups during a growth phase both groups are considered to have been grown by the single stone. If two groups grow so that each of the two new stones touch to unite the two groups into one group, then the move is legal and does not count as growing a group twice in one turn. The lighter color moves first. In order to mitigate any turn order advantage, if neither player has grown their groups, the second player may grow all of his groups and place a single stone on any vacant square on the same turn. Moving is compulsory and a player may not pass his turn at any time. = Scoring = Symple ends when one player resigns or when the game board is full. A player's score is determined by the number of their stones on the board as well as the vacant points entirely surrounded by their stones.  History  Symple had its origins in a conversation between Benedikt Rosenau and Christian Freeling over email discussing the star family of connection games (Star, Superstar, *Star, and YvY). Rosenau noticed that each of these games awarded points for \\"taking certain fields and imposing a tax [on groups of connected pieces]…\\" and was looking for a generalized version of this concept. He was, in his words \\"...at the limit of design without heavy playtesting. I cannot achieve what I want.\\" Christian Freeling initially was uninterested in the concept and filed it away for later use and said \\"I'll put it where I did put the idea of linear movement in Draughts, after inventing Bushka. Might take 15 years though.\\" Despite his initial skepticism, however, Freeling ended up thinking about a generalized version of the gameplay mechanic all the same. He claims that just as he was going to sleep \\"...Symple came rising up, and the last thing I remember thinking was: '... so simple? what's wrong ...?'\\" This first version differed from the present game in a number of ways. Freeling initially conceived of Symple as being played on a hexagon board. The move protocol was also notably different. A player was not required to make any move at all, and instead of choosing between placing a stone down and making a new group or growing all existing groups by one, a player could choose one or both options. He sent the concept to Rosenau who was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea, although he misunderstood the concept to Symple's benefit. He read the rules as giving the player an either or choice between passing, and choosing one of the two options, but not both. This misreading ended becoming the core dilemma of the game, choosing between placing a stone in the hopes of later growth, and growing all existing groups for immediate growth. The only two loose ends were the board configuration and deciding on a balancing rule against first player advantage. Freeling decided that the square grid was better suited to the game than a hex grid and changed it, while Freeling and Rosenau's joint examination of the Pie rule for balancing established that it wasn't effective. The move protocol of Symple serves as a built in pie rule allowing for a natural balance. They settled on allowing the second player to grow all of their groups as well as place a single stone if neither player has grown any groups. Eventually a final \\"flaw\\" in Symple was noticed. The rule that allowed players to pass on their turns caused problems with cooperative drawing in competitive play. This was pointed out to Freeling by Luis Bolaños Mures, creator of Ayu, and Keil, after he noticed several players passing their turns during game play. He sought clarification of the rules due to what he thought was an allowance of \\"trivial draws.\\" After this conversation Freeling decided to change the rule wording from saying players \\"...may..\\" to players \\"...must...\\" place a single stone on the board or grow all their groups.  Strategy  The main dilemma is to figure out how to balance laying stones down versus growing them. Laying down stones allows for more growth later by creating more groups capable of growing, but growing offers immediate return. More groups grow faster than less groups, but if an opponent finds the right balance of group number to early growth they can begin to outpace you and control the board even with less groups growing. There's also the possibility that the opponent who grows early can cut off your groups and force you to accept the group penalty at the end of the game. Christian Freeling and Benedikt Rosenau consider move 12 to be a generally useful turn to begin shifting from placing down stones to growing, but it may be useful to switch sooner or later as strategies are more carefully analyzed. Ideally the opening stones should be placed to be able to secure as much territory for future growth. Controlling the edges of the board is generally useful, but one or two \\"anchor stones\\" in the center are also advantageous. Keeping groups disconnected is important in the early game because it maximizes growth potential. In the endgame, when growth potential is reduced, opportunities arise to cut off the opponent's groups or connect the player's own groups (to eliminate group penalties at the end of the game.) A huge part of the endgame strategy involves something called \\"Invasions,\\" where a player purposely places a stone within the opponent's surrounded territory in order to interfere with their plans. Stones placed in invasion moves have no possibility of reconnecting with other friendly groups. > \\"It is only favorable to start a new group within the 'opponent's > territory', if it can outgrow its own negative starting value and the > inherent forfeit of a growing turn. That of course depends on the value of > P: the higher it is set, the more stones are needed to create a group that > contributes positively to the score, and the more difficult invasions will > become. It may be very unfavorable to be forced to start a new group because > one's growing options have run out. Towards the endgame these options > increasingly diminish.\\"  Trivia  * Symple can be played online against the AiAi program. * Symple has a game complexity of ~10^208, higher than that of Chess, Shogi, Xiangqi, and Go. * Symple was selected for the 2013 Codecup Challenge.

Most of the stops have covered shelters and information terminals with real-time bus arrival times. Some of the stations feature local art. Between downtown and Northland Transit Center, the buses operate with a 10-minute frequency on weekday mornings and afternoons, 15 minutes during off- peak times, and 30 minutes on weekends. The CMAX line has not been assessed by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), which classifies BRT lines. An individual assessment following ITDP's BRT Standard rated the CMAX line in its \\"Other\\" category, failing to meet the \\"Bronze\\", \\"Silver\\", or \\"Gold\\" standards for BRT transport. In 2019, TransitColumbus called the service a \\"great first step\\", though it criticized the service's lack of bus lanes or busways, enclosed stations, ADA accessibility, and off- board payment, calling it moreso \\"BRT- lite\\".https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-from-the-newsroom-the- colu-31091232/episode/could-columbus-get-brt-light-rail-48239863/ The Columbus Dispatch likewise separated the service from \\"true bus rapid-transit lines\\" by noting CMAX's lane-sharing with other traffic and its lack of larger stations.https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190525/would-you-pay-higher-taxes-to- bring-rail-rapid-transit-to-columbus Columbus, OH - COTA bus stop.jpgA CMAX bus shelter COTA countdown clock 01.jpgCountdown clock and information terminal History CMAX was planned as early as 2010, when the Central Ohio Transit Authority applied for a Federal Transit Administration grant. CMAX was created with $48.6 million in funding, including $37.4 million from the federal government grant. It was created to help reduce traffic congestion on Cleveland Avenue, bring economic activity, and increase job and healthcare access to low-income and minority neighborhoods on Cleveland Avenue, including Milo-Grogan and Linden.http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/docs/TCRP_H56_Final_Report.pdf The service complemented and improved COTA's second-busiest route, Local Line 1 Cleveland (present-day route 6).https://www.columbus.gov/uploadedFiles/Columbus/Departments/Development/Planning_Division/Boards_and_Commissions/Columbus_Arts_Commission/Meetings/2015/3%2030%202015_Cleveland%20Ave%20%20CMAX%20CAC%20description.pdf The service began operation on January 1, 2018, and offered free fares in its first week of service. CMAX ridership is projected to increase in the future. One upgrade COTA proposed in 2016, before the line's opening, was for a future high capacity transit corridor for CMAX. It would re-align the route to utilize the former Mt. Vernon Pennsylvania Railroad line. The line could be used for a dedicated busway or for rail, serving the growing populations in Westerville and Polaris.https://www.cota.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/04/NextGen_Appendix_H_Tier2Evaluation.pdf See also * Bus rapid transit creep * List of bus rapid transit systems in the Americas * List of COTA bus routes References External links * * Category:2018 establishments in Ohio Category:Bus rapid transit in Ohio Category:Central Ohio Transit Authority Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2018 Category:Transportation in Columbus, Ohio Category:Transportation in Franklin County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Delaware County, Ohio ","title":"CMAX"},{"id":"65196148","text":"Kwaku Adu Yeboah is a Ghanaian Politician and a member of the Third Parliament of the Fourth Republic representing the Agona East constituency in the Central Region of Ghana.

Career Frijkenius received naval training and in 1776 was made a lieutenant at the Admiralty College in Amsterdam. A year later he became a naval captain first in the admiralty of West Friesland and later a lieutenant-colonel and naval captain in the service of the Dutch Republic. Frijkenius was in 1791 appointed Commissioner-General in charge of the possessions of the VOC, together with Sebastiaan Cornelis Nederburgh and two others. Frijkenius and Nederburgh arrived at the Cape on 18 June 1792 where they remained for a year-and-a-half. The two commissioners always acted together, with Nederburgh apparently taking the lead most of the time. At the Cape they did away with certain governmental posts, combated smuggling and imposed new taxes, in an attempt to reduce expenditure and increase income. The increasing of taxation aroused a great deal of dissatisfaction, and the measure of free trade they introduced did not have the desired effect owing to the scarcity of shipping. Other important changes were the establishment of Colony's first bank, the introduction of whale and other fishing as a private as distinct from a government enterprise, and improvements were also made in the feeding of cattle. On 1 September 1793, they handed over the administration to Abraham Josias Sluysken and the next day they left for Batavia, where they formed an association of four with Governor-General Willem Arnold Alting and the newly appointed Director-General, Johannes Siberg. Frijkenius was also appointed commandant of the country and of the VOC's maritime power in the Dutch East Indies. Frijkenius regularly disagree with the actions of Alting and Nederburgh and was often overruled in the committee. He eventually asked for his discharge in December 1795. Personal Frijkenius was the son of Lambertus Bernhardus Frijkenius, mayor of Wijk bij Duurstede, and his wife, Anna Catharina Rademaker. He was born in Utrecht and baptized there on 28 March 1747. On 19 November 1780 he married Anna Elizabeth Hooft, and they had a son and a daughter.

It was built circa 1775, in red brick, and demolished illegally in 1980.  History  In the 1870s, the house was home to During World War II, the house was occupied, and the estate farmed, by Jack Bickford, who was injured when he picked up an incendiary bomb nearby, which went off in his hands.  Demolition  Although the house was Grade II listed, in theory protecting it from unauthorised alteration, it was demolished on the afternoon of 1 December 1980 – a Sunday – by a bulldozer driver, who was supposed to be demolishing outbuildings on the opposite side of the road. (incudes video clip) The then leader of the local council described the act as \\"sheer, stupid negligence\\".  Court cases  Following a 1981 Crown Court trial, the demolition company responsible, D. Doyle Contractors, was fined £2,000. The driver, who was a director of the firm and who had been warned beforehand by a local resident that the building was listed, was fined £1,500. In a separate, civil case brought by Solihull Borough Council in 1985, a Birmingham High Court judge, Mr. Justice McNeill, ordered that the cost of rebuilding the hall - estimated then to be in the order of £200,000 - using as much material from the demolition as possible, be borne by the contractor. He also awarded costs against the defendants, who had admitted their negligence.  Legacy  The demolition was referenced in the House of Commons by John Heddle, MP for Lichfield and Tamworth, during a July 1981 debate on the Local Government and Planning (Amendment) Bill, as an \\"act of wilful vandalism\\" for which he said \\"imprisonment and punitive fines are the only reasonable remedy.\\" Heddle described the actual fines issued in relation to the case as \\"derisory\\".

The photo, known as Afghan Girl, became famous in June 1985 after appearing on the cover of National Geographic magazine. Gula's identity was unknown until 2002, when her whereabouts were verified and she was photographed for the second time in her life.  Biography  Gula was born into a Pashtun family. In the early 1980s, her village was attacked by Soviet helicopters and during the attacks her parents were killed. Her sisters, brothers and grandmother moved to Pakistan to the Nasir Bagh refugee camp on the border with Afghanistan. It was whilst Gula was attending school there, that McCurry photographed her and other girls. It was later alleged that McCurry did not obtain permission to take the images, which contradict Pashtun culture, where women should not show their faces to men outside the family. In the late 1980s, she married baker Rahmat Gula when she was aged 13, and returned to Afghanistan in 1992. As of 2002, Gula had three daughters, Robin, Zahid and Alyan – her fourth daughter died shortly after birth; she later had a son. Her husband died in 2012. In late October 2016, Gula was arrested by Pakistani police on suspicion of forging an identity document. She was deported by the Pakistani Courts to Afghanistan, where the government promised to take care of her family housing, education and health. In 2017 she was given a house by the Afghan government and a $700 per month stipend for living and medical costs. She lives in Kabul.  Popular culture  Sharbat Gula – Brussels – 2017 2012-04-05 MACRO Testaccio esterno = Afghan Girl photograph = In 1984 National Geographic photographer Steve McCurry travelled to Afghanistan to document the effects of the war, visiting refugee camps, many of which were on the Afghan-Pakistan border. Whilst there, McCurry took what was to become one of the most iconic cover photographs for National Geographic. Initially, the magazine's editor did not want to use the image, but eventually gave in, publishing a cover image which was simply called Afghan Girl. The photo, which shows a girl with a unique green eye colour, looking straight into the lens, became a symbol of the Afghan conflict and the problems affecting refugees around the world.  Identifying Sharbat Gula  The identity of the girl remained unknown for more than 17 years. In the 1990s, the journalist made several unsuccessful attempts to find out the girl's name. In January 2002, a National Geographic team led by Steve McCurry travelled to Afghanistan to find her, however during this search several women and men came forward, claiming to either be Gula, or to be married to her. Eventually she was tracked down through a camp resident who knew her brother. Her identity was verified by John Daugman using iris recognition software. In the intervening years, Gula had no idea how globally symbolic her face had become. It is the only image to have been used three times on National Geographic covers. = Music = The Finnish metal band Nightwish dedicated an instrumental work to Gula, on the 2015 album Endless Forms Most Beautiful entitled \\"The Eyes of Sharbat Gula\\".

The graveyard was necessitated by a major expansion of the city on its south side from around 1810. It was designed with a small stone watchtower, positioned such as to view over the two legs of the cemetery, being built during the height of fears over graverobbing. Peripheral plots were built as enclosed stone vaults with iron bars on their top, for the same reason. https://canmore.org.uk/site/275066/edinburgh-31-east-preston-street-newington- old-burial-ground-watch-tower Operating largely as an \\"overflow\\" burial ground it lacked the kudos of other graveyards such as Greyfriars Kirkyard and operated largely for functional purposes.

His uncle was the Grand Marshal of Jin, Huan Wen. Shiqian's rise to fame began in 354, when he single-handedly saved his uncle Huan Chong from being surrounded by Former Qin forces. He later led and followed in campaigns against the Qin as they advanced south to conquer Jin. Shiqian was remembered by the people of his time for his ferocity in battle.  Early career  Huan Shiqian was the son of Huan Huo, who in turn was the brother Jin's famed general Huan Wen. From a young age, he was noted for possessing a physically strong body. He first distinguished himself in 354 during his uncle's first northern campaign. During the campaign, his other uncle, Huan Chong was surrounded by thousands of Former Qin troops led by Fu Jian. Shiqian charged alone into the enemies to save him. Although they outnumbered him, the Qin soldiers did not dare attack him and Shiqian retrieved his uncle. Due to this event, Huan Shiqian became widely-feared and it was said that it became a popular thing at the time to tell the sick \\"Huan Shiqian has arrived! (桓石虔來!)\\" as a way to get them to recover.(沖為苻健所圍，垂沒，石虔躍馬赴之，拔沖於數萬眾之中而還，莫敢抗者。三軍歎息，威震敵人。時有患虐疾者，謂曰「桓石虔來」以怖之，病者多愈，其見畏如此。) Book of Jin, Volume 74 When Huan Huo was stationed in Jingzhou in 361, Shiqian also followed him there. During a hunting trip, Huan Huo's generals had heard of his strength, so they challenged Shiqian to take down a beast. Supposedly, as he drew his bow, the beast he was hunting pounced on him but Shiqian managed to jump higher than it. Once he landed on the ground, he drew his bow again and killed it. (石虔小字鎮惡。有才幹，趫捷絕倫。從父在荊州，於獵圍中見猛善被數箭而伏，諸督將素知其勇，戲令拔箭。石虔因急往，拔得一箭，猛獸跳，石虔亦跳，高於獸身，猛獸伏，復拔一箭以歸。) Book of Jin, Volume 74  War with Yuan Zhen and Former Qin  Huan Shiqian earned first took command during Huan Wen's quelling of the Yuan clan in Shouchun in 370. Just a year before, Huan Wen lost his chance to conquer Former Yan after he was defeated at the Battle of Fangtou. He shifted blame to his general Yuan Zhen who had failed to secure their supply lines by building a canal. Yuan Zhen in response rebelled in Shouchun but passed away shortly and was succeeded by his son Yuan Qin (袁瑾). Yuan Qin received support from Former Qin and Former Yan so Huan Wen sent Shiqian and Zhu Yao (竺瑤) to stop them.(燕、秦皆遣兵助袁瑾，大司馬溫遣督護竺瑤等御之。燕兵先至，瑤等與戰於武丘，破之。南頓太守桓石虔克其南城。石虔，溫之弟子也。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 102 Shiqian conquered the southern part of Shouchun. Yuan Qin lasted for a year but was on the verge of falling in early 371, so Fu Jian sent his generals Wang Jian (王堅) and Zhang Ci to reinforce the city. However, Shiqian and Huan Yi intercepted them at Shiqiao (石橋, around present-day Lu'an, Anhui) . They repelled Wang Jian and Zhang Ci, allowing Huan Wen to take Shouchun with no interference. Yuan Qin and his followers would be executed as a result. Shiqian then served as Prefect of Jingling.(苻堅乃使其將王鑒、張蠔等率兵以救瑾，屯洛澗，先遣精騎五千次於肥水北。溫遣桓伊及弟子石虔等逆擊，大破之，瑾眾遂潰，生擒之，並其宗族數十人及硃輔送於京都而斬之，所侍養乞活數百人悉坑之，以妻子為賞。) Book of Jin, Volume 98 Former Qin forces conquered the Shu region from Jin in 373. The next year, a native uprising led Zhang Yu (張育) and Yang Jian (楊光) occurred, with Qin and Jin being quick to respond. Qin brought in Deng Qiang to quell the rebellion while Jin sent Shiqian and Zhu Yao in support of it. Shiqian and Zhu Yao attacked Diejiang, where they drove out Yao Chang. Zhang Yu declared himself King of Shu but soon started fighting with his subordinates. Deng Qiang and Yang An took advantage of this and routed them. Deng Qiang then head east, where headed east and defeat Shiqian and Zhu Yao. Zhang Yu was killed later that year, so Former Qin retained the region.(夏四月，堅下書曰：「巴夷險逆，寇亂益州，招引吳軍，為唇齒之勢。特進、鎮軍將軍、護羌校尉鄧羌，可帥甲士五萬，星夜赴討。」五月，蜀人張育、楊光等起兵二萬，以應巴獠。晉威遠將軍桓石虔帥衆二萬入據墊江，張育自號蜀王，稱藩于晉。八月，鄧羌敗晉師於涪西，擊張育、楊光，屯於綿竹，皆斬之，益州平，羌勒銘于岷山而還。十二月，羌至自成都，堅引見東堂，謂之曰：「將軍之先仲華，遇漢世祖於前；將軍復逢朕於後，何鄧氏之多幸。」羌曰：「臣常謂光武之遇仲華，非獨仲華遭光武。」堅笑曰：「將軍蓋以自況，非直將軍之幸，亦朕之遇賢。」) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 4 War between Qin and Jin intensified at Fu Jian intended to conquer the south once and for all. His general Dou Gui (都貴) ordered his officers Yan Zhen (閻振) and Wu Zhong (吳仲) to invade Jingling in 381. Shiqian and his brother, Huan Shimin marched to faced them in battle. The brothers defeated the Qin forces and chased them back to Guancheng, where they captured the city. They captured the commanders and ten thousands of captives while executing a few thousand soldiers.(十二月，甲辰，石虔襲擊振、仲，大破之，振、仲退保管城。石虔進攻之，癸亥，拔管城，獲振、仲，斬首七千級，俘虜萬人。詔封桓沖子謙為宜陽侯，以桓石虔領河東太守。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 105 Shiqian later followed his uncle Huan Chong to attack Xiangyang in 383. Shiqian and Guo Quan (郭銓) defeated Zhang Chong (張崇) at Wudang. However, Huan Chong was enticed into retreating after Murong Chui tricked him by setting torches to make his army appear bigger. His defeat would be avenged later that year when Xie Xuan won a decisive victory over Fu Jian at the Battle of Fei River. The battle drove out Qin forces from the south, and for Shiqian's merits, he was made Inspector of Yuzhou in 384.(秋，七月，郭銓及冠軍將軍桓石虔敗張崇於武當，掠二千戶以歸。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 106  Final years  Shiqian was intended to follow Xie Xuan in his northern expedition after the Battle of Fei River. However, he had to resign after hearing that his mother had passed away. Instead, his position of Inspector of Yuzhou was given to Zhu Xu instead. Shiqian only returned to office in 387 and had his positions restored. Despite that, he did not hold his positions for long as he would pass away just a year later in 388.

His research is focused on antigenic variation, drug action and resistance and the application of genetic screens to African trypanosomes: parasitic protists that cause sleeping sickness or Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and the livestock disease, nagana.  Education and career  Horn was educated at King’s College London where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in 1989. He was awarded a PhD in Molecular Biology from University College London in 1993. Then he joined The Rockefeller University, USA as a Postdoctoral Associate from 1993 to 1997. Between 1997 and 2013 he held various positions at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before joining the faculty at the University of Dundee.  Research  Horn’s research aims to understand the genetics and molecular biology of parasites responsible for Sleeping sickness, or Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) as well as Chagas’ disease and leishmaniasis. He and his team have identified a protein termed ‘VSG exclusion’ or VEX-complex. This is responsible for the parasite’s antigenic variability as it permits the change of the surface protein coat on the parasite which permits the parasite to shield itself from the host’s immune system. His team has also developed a high-throughput RNA Interference Target sequencing (RIT-seq) approach, which allows for the exploitation of genome sequence data, in order to help prioritise drug targets. This research is critical as there are no vaccines and, left untreated, sleeping sickness is typically fatal. Horn and his team have discovered over 50 genes connected to drug action and resistance. Of these, they identified a gene which explains arsenic-based drug-resistance in patients from Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. .  Awards and honours  David Horn was awarded the C.A.

It portrays the brief reign of Lady Jane Grey, a pretender to the English throne following the death of Edward VI and her defeat and execution by Mary I in 1554. The title role was played by the prominent actress Anne Oldfield.Dennison p.194 The cast also included John Mills as the Duke of Northumberland, Barton Booth as Lord Guilford Dudley and Lacy Ryan as the Earl of Sussex, Colley Cibber as Bishop Gardiner, James Quin as the Lieutenant of the Tower and Mary Porter as the Duchess of Suffolk. Rowe was a staunch Whig and wrote the play in the wake of the Hanoverian Succession where George I had taken the throne ahead of his Catholic Jacobite rival James Stuart, who launched an unsuccessful rebellion later in 1715. Rowe dedicated the work to Caroline, Princess of Wales drawing comparisons between her and Lady Jane Grey as a rightful Protestant heir.Dennison p.151 Shortly afterwards he was appointed Poet Laureate. It was the final play written by Rowe. Although not his most successful play, it was revived on a number of occasions during the following century. The 1836 opera Giovanna Gray, with a libretto by Carlo Pepoli, was based on the play. References Bibliography * Burling, William J.

Contents Vikings provides a campaign setting called \\"Scania\\" that draws on historical and legendary sources for the Viking period. The boxed set contains: * a 38-page \\"Players Book\\" * a 30-page \\"Gamemaster Book\\" * a 46-page \\"Scenario Book\\" containing six linked scenarios * a 20-page \\"Viking Digest\\" * a 15\\" x 22\\" map * blank character sheets Information includes daily life in a Viking village, the justice system, character creation, new magic spells, religion, and new monsters. Publication history In 1984, Chaosium, the creators of RuneQuest, partnered with Avalon Hill to create a third edition of the role- playing game, hoping to take advantage of the larger company's marketing and publication power. For the most part, Chaosium refused to allow Avalon Hill to produce any material for Runequests original setting, Glorantha. Instead, Avalon Hill's material was set in a generic feudal setting known as Fantasy Earth. Vikings, the first of the Fantasy Earth supplements, was written by Greg Stafford and Sandy Petersen with Ken Rolston, with illustrations by Charlie Krank, and cover art by Steve Purcell, and was published by Avalon Hill in 1985. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, game historian Shannon Appelcline commented that after Chaosium partnered with Avalon Hill in 1984, \\"Over the next five years, Chaosium acted as creators of RuneQuest material. Glorantha was largely ignored, other than the singular Gods of Glorantha (1985), but Chaosium did create interesting supplements for the new Fantasy Earth background, including Vikings (1985) and Land of Ninja (1987).\\" Reception Oliver Dickinson reviewed Vikings for White Dwarf #74, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \\"This pack need not interest Viking-lovers only. The society described can provide many analogies for other RQ 'barbarian' societies, the special means for acquiring magic might interest many players, and the scenarios are easily adaptable. Overall, this is a promising start, offering reasonable value for money.\\" In the May 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue #181), Rick Swan thought that, although Vikings at that time was seven years old, it was \\"still the one to beat — a thoroughly entertaining treatment of Viking culture, light on the historical clutter that makes so many campaign guides a drag to read.\\" Swan admired both the packaging and the elegant writing. Although he thought the chapter on fantasy and magic was \\"disappointingly skimpy,\\" he called the new monsters \\"a treat — an imaginative GM will still find a lot to work with.\\" Swan also thought the campaign book was the high point of the boxed set, calling its contents \\"intelligent suggestions for staging Viking adventures.\\" He concluded by giving Vikings an above average rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \\"This offers pure, engaging fun and, despite the rather superficial magic section, is a first-rate fantasy campaign set.

Life  Born in Dresden, Bierey was a pupil of Christian Ehregott Weinlig. As soon as 1788, he became music director of the Döbbelinschen. From 1794 until 1806, he worked for Joseph Seconda in Dresden and Leipzig. In 1807 he made a guest appearance in Vienna, and from December 1807 until 1828 he worked as kapellmeister at the Wrocław Opera, where he succeeded Carl Maria von Weber and his successor Müller. From 1824 to 1828, Bierey also became a director of the municipal theatre there, but he came into constant conflict with Karl Schall, who opposed him in his Neue Breslauer Zeitung and vigorously opposed his allegedly unartistic and only money-making management. In Dresden, he was a member of the masonic lodge Zum goldenen Apfel.Gottlob Benedikt Bierey on Musicalics At the time of Biery's, the baritone Johann Theodor Mosewius was also active in Wroclaw (1788-1858) and the comedians Heinrich Schmelka, Ludwig Wohlbrück and Fritz Beckmann. From 1829, Bierey privatized for health reasons in Wiesbaden, Mainz, Leipzig, Weimar.Bierey, Gottlob Benedict, on weber-gesamtausgabe With few exceptions, his compositions belong to the field of music theatre and consist, besides Lieder, a symphony (1801), a number of cantatas, choirs and songs for stage plays, preludes and 26 operas and operettas, most of which were popular in their time. He wrote his opera Vladimir, Prince of Novgorod (1806), which led to his appointment to Breslau, for the Theater an der Wien. Especially lucky was a continuation of Ferdinand Kauer's Donauweibchen (part three) in 1801, 1811 the music for Zacharias Werner's play Die Weihe der Kraft and 1814 Almazinde oder die Höhle Sesam. Many of his operas suffered from weak texts and therefore did not last long, even though the music, which was sometimes accused of being too closely related to Luigi Cherubini, was praised and enjoyed listening to. Biery's wife Sophie née Moreau and his daughter Wilhelmine worked as singers at times. His nickname as a foreign member of the Vienna literary society Ludlamshöhle was \\"Rossini of Novgorod\\".

He presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools. Sowell points out that not all charter schools are successful, but failing charter schools can have their charters revoked which cuts off access to public funds. This, he argues, is a much better situation than with traditional public schools which do not always have their access to public funds cut off if they start to fail. Sowell has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the United States.  Summary  Sowell argues that charter schools are better than conventional schools in numerous ways, but most importantly on educational outcomes. He dispels many claims made about charter schools and tries to demonstrate the need for educational reform in the United States. Sowell dedicates the book to \\"those children whose futures hang in the balance\\" as a result of the current state of the education system.Sowell, Charter Schools… pp. iii Sowell presents lots of data and statistics on charter schools and normal schools in order to compare the two. he concludes that charter schools are an effective weapon against an \\"achievement gap\\" between white students and black students with the former often doing better than the latter in educational outcomes at normal schools. An example he gives that aims to prove this point is an example of one predominantly-black charter school with an average household income of $49,000 that had higher test scores than wealthier schools with average household incomes some five times higher. Sowell starts by explaining the current situation with charter schools. He explains that public opinion of charter schools is very divided with some calling it either \\"a striking success or a 'failed and damaging experiment'\\".Sowell, Charter Schools… pp. 1 He writes about how he will compare educational systems that an intellectual’s work begins and ends with ideas, not the practical application of ideas to real world problems. These purveyors of ideas may be at all points of the political and ideological spectrum, although Sowell generally reserves his sharpest criticisms for those on the left. Sowell explains the ways of measuring results, then lays out the latest data and statistics on educational results in charter schools with appropriate comparisons of standard schools. With these statistics, Sowell lays out his central thesis that charter schools have far better educational outcomes for the students that attend them.Sowell, Charter Schools… pp. 7 Sowell states that charter schools are much more accountable than most typical public schools. This is because while not all charter schools are successful, they can have their charters revoked which cuts off access to public funds. This means that charter schools are incentivised to do better and are accountable to those who are in control of the funding. This, he writes, is not the case with traditional public schools which do not always have their access to public funds cut off if they start to fail. A notable quotation from Sowell in regards to dangers to education and charter schools was pointed out in a review by the National Review magazine: \\"What we can do is consider in advance what kind of general principles and specific institutions seem promising. Perhaps the most important of these general principles is that schools exist for the education of children. Schools do not exist to provide iron-clad jobs for teachers, billions of dollars in union dues for teachers unions, monopolies for educational bureaucracies, a guaranteed market for teachers college degrees or a captive audience for indoctrinators\\".

Clay Kaserne, Germany ** Headquarters and Headquarters Service Company ** A Company ** B Company  History  The 24th Air Reconnaissance Support Battalion was organised in 1959 in New York City, New York with a headquarters company, four line detachments and an aviation section. The unit first activated for the Berlin Crisis in 1961. From 1962 to 1974 the battalion was variously located at Miller Field, Fort Hamilton, and Fort Wadsworth in the vicinity of Staten Island, NY. Also in 1962, the battalion was redesignated as the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion. In 1974 the battalion moved to Fort Monmouth, NJ where it was authorised by First Army to teach the Basic Imagery Interpretation Course.Finnegan & Danysh, pp. 269–270, Appendix 24th Military Intelligence Battalion. In 1977, the battalion began participating in Operation MIHAWK, utilising OV-1 Mohawk technology. Over the next three years, detachments deployed with Air National Guard (ANG) units supporting numerous brigades with imagery products during counter drug operations in the western and southern United States. In 1980, the battalion began training with the 1st MI Bn Aerial Reconnaissance Squadron, an active duty component unit at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina; and Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas. By the mid 1980's, detachments of the 24th MI Bn became aligned exclusively with ANG Squadrons. Concurrently, personnel from the 24th MI Bn were the first reservists selected to attend the Active Air Force Advanced Imagery Interpretation Course in Shierstein, Federal Republic of Germany. Since 1987, detachments of the 24th MI Bn have participated in exercises including REFORGER in Zwehrucker, Germany; Operation SAFARI in Bardufass, Norway; MAPLE FLAG in Cold Water, Canada; and BRIM FROST in Anchorage, Alaska. On 20 January 1991, Detachment C was activated and deployed to the Kuwait Theater of Operations for Operation DESERT STORM. Battalion personnel worked at the Intelligence Center and Joint Imagery Production Complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, supporting US Army Central Command. In October 1992, three detachments (E, F, and G) were added to the battalion. The following year, in October 1993, Detachments H and K, based in Mountain View, California, were added. In November 1993, the battalion provided live mission support to the 513th MI Bde, the XVIII Airborne Corps, US Transportation Command, and the Intelligence Threat Analysis Center. In 1994, the battalion added the Joint Analysis Center at RAF Molesworth, United Kingdom and assisted the civilian evacuation of Rwanda. From 1995 to 1998, the unit supported Operation GOLD SWORD for the 800th MP Bde. Also from 1996 to 1998, the battalion deployed personnel to Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1997 Detachments H and K were dropped from the battalion and assigned to the 500th MI Bn in California. On 15 July 2009 the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion was activated in Wiesbaden, Germany, with a mission to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance synchronisation and all-source intelligence analysis, production, and dissemination in support of national, joint, and USAREUR requirements. Since activation, 24th MI Bn has supported multiple operations including Operations IRAQI FREEDOM, NEW DAWN, ENDURING FREEDOM, and UNIFIED PROTECTOR. The battalion has also participated in multiple engagements and intelligence security cooperation activities with foreign partners across the European and African continents. In 2009, the 302nd Military Intelligence Battalion, assigned to the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade, was inactivated and reflagged as the 24th Military Intelligence Battalion, therefore transferring the lineage into the regular army.

As the inaugural Secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies (now Humanists UK), she held the equivalent role of today's Chief Executive. Hull House, Chicago, where Vallance delivered a lecture in 1902  Life  Zona Vallance was born in Stratford, London on 6 February 1904, the daughter of Thomas James Vallance, a doctor, and Lucy (née Skipper). At 30, she was a founding member of the East London Ethical Society (launched in 1890), described as 'devoted and enthusiastic' by fellow worker Frederick James Gould in his Life-Story of a Humanist. From her earliest involvement with the Ethical Movement, Vallance spoke widely on its behalf, advocating the development of moral ideas and action distinct from theological or supernatural beliefs. A central principle of the movement was that 'the love of goodness and the love of one's fellows are the true motives for right conduct; and self-reliance and co-operation are the true sources of help.' Vallance herself wrote that 'Salvation consists in the surrender of the private for the public weal'. Zona Vallance was the first Secretary of both the Union of Ethical Societies and the Moral Instruction League, which advocated for non-theological moral education for the young. She contributed regularly to the journal the Ethical World, writing on women's rights and suffrage, keeping up 'a commentary on Parliament, the courts, and on women's societies'. Her significance to the movement is noted by Gustav Spiller in his history of the Ethical Movement in Great Britain, who wrote > The name of Miss Vallance recurs repeatedly in this History as Secretary to > the Ethical Union and to the Moral Instruction League, and in other > capacities. She contributed frequently to the columns of The Ethical World, > wrote leaflets and pamphlets, lectured, and assisted in numerous other ways, > and stressed more especially justice to women in the social and political > sphere.  Work for the Union of Ethical Societies  Vallance was secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies 1895-1899, and the Moral Instruction League from December 1897 to January 1900. She was also an organiser in the Union's Moral Instruction Circle, which worked to convince 'numerous London teachers and parents that moral instruction could be interestingly and effectively given.' As part of this, in June 1899 Vallance and others from the Union of Ethical Societies (including J. R. MacDonald) presented a petition to the London School Board challenging the use of the Bible in schools, and arguing that 'the supposition that parents are pleased with the present Bible teaching is quite unfounded in fact'. The Committee suggested that > It is universally admitted that various motives concur to hinder parents > from availing themselves of the \\"Conscience Clause\\" of the Education Act. In > addition to the fears for themselves or their children which deter them, > many parents are influenced by the knowledge that the hour devoted to > theological teaching is also the only time set apart for systematic > instruction in morals, and many who disapprove the former are nevertheless > unwilling to deprive their children of the latter. In 1901, Vallance was assigned a one-year lectureship by the Ethical Lecturers' Fund Committee, which consisted of Leslie Stephen, A. Vernon Harcourt, G. F. Stout, J. H. Muirhead, and Stanton Coit. This Committee arose 'from a conviction... that a great national good might be done by a thorough teaching and preaching of moral principles among the people,' undertaken by those in sympathy with the principles of the Union of Ethical Societies. The following year, Vallance undertook a lecture tour of the United States, speaking at various societies and clubs. Among these was Hull House, a settlement co-founded in 1899 by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr, where she gave a talk entitled 'The Economic Dependence of Man upon Women'. In it, she argued that women must agitate for political rights, and that they deserved to be compensated through some form of national tax for their services in the household. At the conference of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, Vallance lectured on 'Women and the Ethical Movement', stating that 'all self- respecting women' should 'be found in the vanguard of self-assertion today' and lead the way in ethical reforms. She also spoke in praise of women's trade unions as an example of the way 'the woman of ethical culture persuasion should bend her energies to the enlightenment ... and industrial emancipation of women in the busier walks of life'. In addition to lecturing, Vallance produced a number of pamphlets for the Union of Ethical Societies, including 'Reason in the Ethical Movement', 'The Ethical Movement and Women', and 'The Ethical Movement and the After Life'. She wrote at length on the role of women in a chapter for the 1900 collection Ethical Democracy: Essays in Social Dynamics, published by the Society of Ethical Propagandists and edited by Stanton Coit. Other contributors to the volume included G.H. Perris, J. R. MacDonald, J. H. Muirhead, F. J. Gould, Margaret McMillan, and Christen Collin.  Women's Rights  Vallance's socialism, humanism, and feminism were deeply intertwined. In 1902 she contributed an article to the International Journal of Ethics on the position of women entitled 'Women as Moral Beings'. This was summarised in Mind as arguing that '[u]nless intelligent women have more rights as against their husbands they may refuse the burdens of marriage. They should be put more on a financial and legal equality, and should be remunerated for the duties of motherhood. Vallance 'looks forward to a women’s movement that advocates such reforms in recognition of both the “tyranny of limiting all women to family occupations” and the “pernicious effects of expecting a domestic worker to be also a market earner”.' In 'Women as Moral Beings', she asked > Can our world be so re-modelled that women no less than men shall have free > scope for the satisfaction of many-sided human nature and aspiration? ... > What is right for finite beings to do always depends on what is possible; > and yet the very Hall-mark of Humanity is to sit in judgement upon the > possible. Ian MacKillop argues that as the lead writer on women's issues in the Ethical World from 1899 until her death in 1904, Vallance was by no means 'preaching to the converted', but 'had to justify female suffrage from the beginnings'. He notes that Vallance took particular aim at 'the socialist of good-will who simply could not understand the relevance of the woman question to analysis of capitalism'. For her, the individualistic ideology of capitalism and the idea of men as inherently dominant, contributed to the ongoing subjugation of women in social and political life. Of Vallance's focus on motherhood, which was read by some as counter to progressive feminist ideas, MacKillop writes that > She made much of the mother-figure because of the place it occupied for her > in an evolutionist's myth of origin which replaced the Christian myth of > patriarchy. Under theology-based systems of ethics woman was passive, > unenquiring and obedient, until sinful. Under a post-Darwinian system woman > was, in a quite literal sense, capable of being held responsible for the > 'ethical movement' of mankind... It is not meant to decree a retreat into > solo responsibility for child-care in twentieth-century woman. On the > contrary, Zona Vallance thought that husband and wife should act as > partners, a collaboration between genders which contested the Christian > single gender model of paired authority, that between Father and Son.  Death  Zona Vallance died in Kensington on 15 December 1904, at the age of 44. Of her, fellow suffragist, socialist, and ethical society member Dora Montefiore wrote > The cause of Humanity lost on December 16 [sic] one of its most devoted > workers in the person of Zona Vallance, writer and lecturer, who, after a > short but painful illness, is now at rest. A woman fellow-worker writes of > her: “She recognised clearly and fully that every worthy motive for right > living remained the same, whether life lived ‘for evermore,’ or ceased with > the parting breath; and the less she concerned herself for a personal > immortality the more she strove for the well-being and the moral progress of > the race. ‘Progress,’ writes a modern author, consists in human souls, > taught to know their dignity, and the vast Universe of their inheritance.' Zona Vallance’s significant contributions to the Ethical Movement were acknowledged in Stanton Coit’s Ethical Church with a plaque designed by Ernestine Mills, a fellow Ethical Society member and women’s rights advocate. In a pamphlet describing the secular church, Coit wrote > The first memorial tablet to be placed in our Church is the one to the left > of our pulpit. It is a testimonial of the high esteem in which Miss Zona > Vallance was held by all her colleagues in the Suffrage and Ethical > Movements. It is a splendid enamel by Mrs Ernestine Mills, representing a > Joan of Arc figure bearing an ensign of purple, green and white, the colours > of the Women’s Social and Political Union, and memorialising Miss Vallance’s > enthusiastic welcome to this more aggressive organisation, concerning the > latter developments of which she did not live to form a judgement. A bequest by Vallance 'for the promotion of the cause of all women's political, professional and financial equality with men' caused consternation among her executors and next of kin. In 1945, the Gloucester Citizen reported that although the National Council of Women had claimed the gift, a judge ruled that it was 'invalid for uncertainty', stating that he 'had no notion how a trust to promote the cause of equality with men or womenhood in general, wherever they might come from and whatever their race or colour, could be executed by the Court.'

He came to recognise that he was a better songwriter than performer, and first found success in 1888 when his song \\"Ask a P'liceman\\", with music by A. E. Durandeau, was taken up by comedian and singer James Fawn. Within three years, the song reportedly sold half a million copies as sheet music.

Rogers began writing some of Robey's songs, including \\"The Simple Pimple\\", and monologues. He also wrote material for Vesta Tilley, including her successful song \\"Following in Father's Footsteps\\" in 1902. Tilley commented on Rogers' prodigious output of material: \\"It was a rare thing not to see Rogers at my home in London every day with a batch of new numbers. He turned them out so quickly, and they were all more or less successful.\\" He also wrote for other performers including Florrie Forde, Marie Lloyd, Tom Costello, Arthur Lennard, and Alec Hurley, for whom he wrote the original \\"Lambeth Walk\\" (not the 1937 Noel Gay song of the same name).

Formally, we are given a graph G = (V, E), and a partition of the vertex-set V into some k subsets, V1, ..., Vk, called priority classes. A priority matching is a matching that, among all possible matchings, saturates the largest number of vertices from V1; subject to this, it saturates the largest number of vertices from V2; subject to this, it saturates the largest number of vertices from V3; and so on. Priority matchings were introduced by Alvin Roth, Tayfun Sonmez and Utku Unver in the context of kidney exchange. In this problem, the vertices are patient-donor pairs, and each edge represents a mutual medical compatibility. For example, an edge between pair 1 and pair 2 indicates that donor 1 is compatible with patient 2 and donor 2 is compatible with patient 1. The priority classes correspond to medical priority among patients. For example, some patients are in a more severe condition so they must be matched first. Roth, Sonmez and Unver assumed that each priority-class contains a single vertex, i.e., the priority classes induce a total order among the pairs. Later, Yasunori Okumura extended the work to priority-classes that may contain any number of vertices. He also showed how to find a priority matching efficiently using an algorithm for maximum-cardinality matching, with a run-time complexity of O (V E + V2 log V). Jonathan S. Turner presented a variation of the augmenting path method (Edmonds' algorithm) that finds a priority matching in time O (V E).

Her particular areas of interest were American folk art and furniture and contemporary craft objects, furniture, and jewelry. In those areas she collected widely. Farago was known for identifying significant artists early in their careers. Art News Magazine included her among the 100 top collectors in the world. Her donations of artworks to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston were extensive and considered transformative. Biography Daphne Arcus was born March 8, 1924 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Hyman and Rachel (née Berkowitch) Arcus. After World War II, Daphne Arcus was active in Europe to aid in relief work with displaced persons in Europe. She met her future husband Peter Farago in Munich where she was working with the Red Cross. He too was working in the relief effort. Peter Farago was born on March 31, 1922 in Oradea, Romania to Aladar Farago and Margaret Berger. Many of his family died during the Holocaust. Peter escaped from a Nazi forced labor camp in the Carpathian Mountains after 1.5 years imprisonment. Speaking five languages, he was particularly useful to the U.S. Military and other agencies involved in relief work. In 1948 Peter entered the United States, debarking from a military ship at Brooklyn, New York. He attended Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), earning a B. S. degree in textile engineering in 1952. In 1954 he started a successful business, the New England Printed Tape Co., in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. NEPTCO produced tape and later coated films and substrates for the insulation of wires and cables. Daphne emigrated to Montreal, Canada and then to the United States in 1950. In 1951, Daphne married Peter Farago. They lived in Providence, Rhode Island, summering in Little Compton near the Sakonnet River and Narragansett Bay. Other areas where they lived include Marathon, Key West, and Key Biscayne in Florida. The Faragos had three sons, Alan, Paul and Robert. Daphne Farago Wing, RISD Museum of Art Daphne became a docent at the RISD Museum of Art. A self-taught collector, she became highly regarded for her work with American folk art and furniture in the 1960s and 1970s. This collection was donated and many of the pieces auctioned off in 1991 to benefit the RISD Museum of Art. In 1993, the RISD Museum of Art created an exhibition center named the Daphne Farago Wing in her honor. Next, Farago focused on contemporary studio craft works, collecting glass, ceramics, wooden objects and furniture in addition to fiber art and jewelry. She became known for her \\"discerning eye\\" and her ability to identify emerging artists who would become leaders in their fields. For her, part of the appeal of collecting was the opportunity for involvement and interaction with the artists, to directly show her respect for them and their work. American Collar II, 1999, by Jan Yager She regarded jewelry as a form of public art, to be worn. In her jewelry collection she focused on the twentieth century from 1940 onwards, first collecting American jewelry and later adding European works. Farago liked to collect wearable jewelry, but also bought some pieces which were more provocative, such as Jan Yager's American Collar II. Artists whose works she collected include Robert Ebendorf, Mary Lee Hu, Sam Kramer, Bruce Metcalf, and Art Smith. She was an early supporter of artists such as glass sculptors Dale Chihuly and Michael Glancy; ceramic sculptor Kenneth Price; wood sculptors and furniture builders Sam Maloof, John Cederquist, and Wendell Castle; and sculptors Louis Mueller and Claus Bury. She also collected works by fiber and textile artists such as Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Kate Anderson, Jeannette Marie Ahlgren, Dominic Di Mare, Lenore Tawney and Kay Sekimachi. Farago also made significant donations of works to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA), donations whose impact was transformative. Over her lifetime, she donated nearly 1000 objects to the Museum, including over 80 works of contemporary fiber art by Ed Rossbach and Katherine Westphal (2004) and over 650 pieces of contemporary jewelry (2006). The Daphne and Peter Farago Gallery at the Museum was opened in 2011. Her collection of jewelry became the basis for the exhibition Jewelry by Artists: The Daphne Farago Collection which was held at the MFA in 2007, and the reference work Jewelry By Artists in the Studio 1940-2000, published by the MFA. Farago also supported the yearly Farago Lecture on Jewelry at the MFA which focused on art jewelry. Peter Farago died on February 21, 2010. In 2012, Daphne Farago gave the MFA its largest gift of contemporary craft art to date, 161 craft objects made of fiber, ceramics, glass, wood, metal, and basketry. The gift was unrestricted. The Faragos are identified as \\"Great Benefactors\\" for making gifts of the value of $2.5 million-$5 million to the museum.

He was the leader of the Progressive Republican Party from 1895 until his death in 1912. He is noted as a pioneer in the introduction of modern psychiatric treatments in Spain.  Biography  José María Esquerdo Zaragoza was born in Villajoyosa, Alicante on February 2, 1842. He was the son of farm workers. He completed his medical training at the San Carlos Hospital of Madrid, though there it is unclear whether he began his education there or at the University of Valencia. After completing his studies he relocated to Talavera de la Reina. Following the 1868 Glorious Revolution, he became the chair of pathology and director of the clinic of mental diseases of the General Hospital of Madrid. In 1872, Esquerdo volunteered to treat those wounded during the Third Carlist War. In May 1877, he founded a psychiatric hospital in Carabanchel. Esquerdo ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Congress of Deputies in the February 1891 general election, the first one since the restoration of universal male suffrage in Spain. Splitting the vote with a fellow Progressive Republican, Esquerdo's bid was ultimately unsuccessful. However, he shortly after won a seat as a Madrid municipal councillor during the May municipal election, representing the district of Hospital. Esquerdo ran again as a candidate for Madrid to the Congress of Deputies as part of a joint Republican ticket named \\"Unión Republicana\\" at the 1893 general election. This time, he won the seat with a plurality of the vote. Following the death of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla in 1895, Esquerdo became the leader of the Progressive Republican Party. His leadership in the party, however, was not accepted by those represented by , founder of (an important party newspaper). The party thus lost the newspaper's support and was forced to replace it with the newly-created El Progreso in 1897, edited by Alejandro Lerroux. Esquerdo ran as a candidate for the Republican–Socialist Conjunction (CRS) for Madrid at the 1910 general election and again earned a seat at the Congress of Deputies. He received 41,939 votes and became the second-most voted candidate in the capital, after his fellow Republican Benito Pérez Galdós. He participated in the Central Committee of the CRS meetings, where he grew closer to the faction favouring collaboration with the government, which was represented by Melquíades Álvarez and Gumersindo de Azcárate. He died on 30 January 1930 in his Madrid home. The Progressive Republican Party was dissolved soon after his death.

Van den Eynde became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1620. He was the first prominent sculptors of the Van den Eynde family of artists and entrepreneurs. He trained with an unknown master and taught Sebastiaen van den Eynde, son of his brother Cornelis, his other nephew Sebastian de Neve, and his own son Norbert van den Eynde. In the early 17th century, Van den Eynde was among the leading Flemish artists who rejected contrived Mannerist formulae in favour of greater verisimilitude. Among the works by Van den Eynde that survived to this day there are the monumental Waterpoort in Antwerp; the high altar in black and white marble and alabaster, flanked by two paintings by Anthony van Dyck, in the Church of Our Lady of Dendermonde; and the Rubenesque marble statues of Gideon and Joshua in the Antwerp Cathedral. Life and Family Van den Eynde was born into the Van den Eynde family, an Antwerpian family of artists and entrepreneurs. The Van den Eynde would become, in the late 17th century, one of the most prominent families of sculptors in Antwerp, part of the Quellinus-Verbrugghen-Willemssens- Scheemaeckers-Van den Eynde consortium, which enjoyed virtual monopoly on the sculpture market in Antwerp. The extensive collaboration between the workshops of these families in the late 17th century might be in fact the most important factor to account for the intricate \\"unity of style and approaches that have made disentangling of hands particularly difficult for art historians.\\" Hubert van den Eynde was the family's first notable sculptor. Van den Eynde went on to become master off the Guild of Saint Luke in September 1620. He later taught his nephews Sebastian van den Eynde and Sebastian de Neve, as well as his son Norbert. Van den Eynde was married twice. He married Elizabeth Schorkens, who died in September 1623 or 1624; and then Elizabeth van Breen, by whom he had a son, Norbert. Work Van den Eynde became master of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1620. A few years later, he was commissioned the Waterpoort of Antwerp, a triumphal arch in honor of Charles V, which he realized with the help of Hans van Mildert. The Waterpoort, or Porta Regia, was erected in 1624. Gideon, left, and Joshua, right, Antwerp Cathedral Waterpoort, Antwerp During the 1630s, Van den Eynde received numerous other civic commissions, including sculptural decorations on the Vierscharr and the Beurs of Antwerp. Van den Eynde's most remarkable work, however, is that which he performed on Antwerp's churches and the city's Cathedral. On October 8, 1629, Van den Eynde began working on the high altar of the Church of Our Lady of Dendermonde. The altar was realized in black and white marble and alabaster, and completed within a year. In the early 1630s, Van den Eynde executed a monumental Madonna, which stood near the town hall of Antwerp. In 1635, he collaborated on the Meirbrugge Crucifixion (now at the Antwerp Cathedral). The following year, in 1636, Van den Eynde produced a beautiful sculpture of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child in sandstone: The Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus. This sculpture used to sit in the garden of the Maagdenhuismuseum. It was subsequently moved inside and replaced with a copy, which can better withstand harsh weather conditions. thumbleftCopy of The Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus in the garden of the Maidens' House Museum, Antwerp The Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus, Maidens' House Museum, Antwerp In 1640, Van den Eynde completed the high altar of Averbode. In 1648, he realized the high altar of Steenokkerzeel, while in 1653 he completed the principal altar of the church of Duffel. In the 1650s, Van den Eynde collaborated with Artus Quellinus II, producing a set of sculptures for the Antwerp Cathedral. Of these, today only two marble statues of Gideon and Joshua remain still on the original spot. These two statues used to flank a marble of Saint Michael produced in collaboration by Quellinus and Van de Eynde, which stood over the Schermersaltaar. The statues used to sit by the fencers' altar of Saint Michael, which stood against the southern mother pillar of the central nave. Today the statues are located in the back of the nave, standing against the buttresses of the towers. The statues of Gideon and Joshua, as all works by Van den Eynde, show the artist's adherence to the High Baroque style of Rubens, and thus the influence the latter had on Van den Eynde and his pupils. Van den Eynde was selected by Van Dyck as one of the hundred artists to be included in the former's Iconography, a collection of portraits of Van Dyck's eminent contemporaries created using Van Dyck's etchings and under Van Dyck's supervision (Van den Eynde is one of the only three sculptors present in the collection, the others being Hans van Mildert and Andries de Nole). The collection was one of the first and most important of its kind.

The two- part reform replace Mongolian as the medium of instruction by Standard Mandarin in three particular subjects and replace three regional textbooks, printed in Mongolian script, by the edited by the Ministry of Education, written in Standard Mandarin. On a broader scale, the opposition to the curriculum change reflects ethnic issues in China and the decline of . The three subjects in concern are Language and Literature (referring Standard Mandarin) from first grade, Morality and Rule of law from first grade (a variant of civic education) and History from seventh grade. The reform was part of the national textbook reform rolled out elsewhere in China from Autumn 2017 to eliminate various provincial textbooks by the nationally-unified textbook series, which has been criticized elsewhere in China. The parents and students of the ethnic schools strongly opposed the curriculum reform. The sentiment spread to other Chinese Mongols not attending those schools, leading to protests. While seen as an attempt to assimilate ethnic minority, observers also note it exemplifies the \\"second generation's ethnic policy\\" under Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary and President Xi Jinping, who \\"envisioned the melting pot formula of the West, in particular the U.S.A., as the ultimate solution to the ethnic problems\\". Background =Political history of Inner Mongolia= Inner Mongolia has, for a long time, experienced less violent ethnic strife than Xinjiang and Tibet. The region \\"was seen to have been largely pacified over many decades of Han migration, intermarriage and repression\\". Large-scale Han migration began from 1912 during the Beiyang government period when land became freely traded. By 1937, the aggregated figure of the census of the Nanking Nationalist government- ruled Suiyuan Province and Chahar Province and the census of Japanese-puppet Manchukuo and Mongol United Autonomous Government, reported 3,720,000 Hans and 860,000 Mongols (roughly 8:2 ratio) within modern Inner Mongolian boundary. That ratio continues today. The 1981 Inner Mongolia student protest opposed a package of new policies which worsened steppe degradation and the political representation of Chinese Mongols. The policies included; increasing 100 million cattle in the province, settling instead of repatriating the (盲流) from neighboring provinces, and placing Mongol officials in place in Mongols- majority settlements while Han officials in place in Han-majority settlements. In May 2011, unrest erupted when a coal truck collided and killed a Chinese Mongol herdman, and was later followed with unrests which complained of the environmental impact of mining and unfair development policies. =Origin of protest: Curriculum reform, 2020= The top four languages native to Inner Mongolia are Jin language, Northeastern Mandarin, varieties of Mongolian dialects and Lanzhou-Ningxia Mandarin.Language Atlas of China (2nd edition): Minority languages volume. Beijing: The Commercial Press. ［中国语言地图集(第2版):少数民族语言卷］Language Atlas of China (2nd edition): Chinese dialects volume. Beijing: The Commercial Press. ［中国语言地图集(第2版):汉语方言卷］The majority of Mongols and almost all Hans opt to send their children to schools taught in Standard Mandarin, in recognition of the economic opportunities that would reap. Yet, a sizable minority among the Mongols attend ethnic schools, taught primarily in Mongolian. On 26 August 2020, Inner Mongolia's Department of Education officially published a two-part curriculum reform for ethnic schools. Mongolian as the medium of instruction will be replaced by Standard Mandarin in the three subjects of Language and Literature (referring Standard Mandarin) from first grade, Morality and Rule of law from first grade (a variant of civic education) and History from seventh grade. The reform was part of the national textbook reform rolled out in China in 2017 to eliminate various provincial textbooks by the ,which has attracted repeated criticism elsewhere in China. This policy has been applied in every province and is now making inroad into Inner Mongolia. While seen as an attempt to assimilate ethnic minority, Observers also note it exemplifies the \\"second-generation's ethnic policy\\" under paramount leader Xi Jinping, who \\"envisioned the melting pot formula of the West, in particular the U.S.A., as the ultimate solution to the ethnic problems\\". Xi Jinping \\"rejects the old Soviet-based system, which allowed relative autonomy and preservation of language and culture in designated regions, in favor of the new approach\\". Protests =Timeline= Sign of public defiance began in 30 August, when students in Inner Mongolia protesting against the new Mandarin Chinese language program. However, it remained local until 31 August 2020, when the Inner Mongolian education department announced that Mongolian language would be removed in history, politics, language and literature subjects, started from 1 September, and will become officially effects, with other subjects to be added. Following the announcement, thousand of ethnic Mongols protested what they saw as an attempt to turn the Mongolian language into a foreign language in their homeland. The protesters considered this as an attempt by the Chinese government to curb them from learning the Mongolian language and to disconnect them from their nomadic background. Many Mongol families announced they would not send their children to schools until Mongolian language is reinstated as an education language in Inner Mongolia. In a similar case in Tongliao, a prefecture of Inner Mongolia, parents found out about the announcement only after sending their kids to a boarding school, which led to the protests. The parents besieged the school before being repelled by the police. The authorities released their children from the school despite rampant pressure. All Mongolian-based ethnic schools went quiet aftermath while the authorities sought to persuade families to bring children back to school. Resentment against forced Mandarin-based education was also reflected on the Chinese social media by Mongol users, however it was removed by the authorities. On 1 September, staff at a school in Naiman county told the BBC that only around 40 students had registered for the semester in place of the usual 1,000. Some subsequently changed their minds, and only some 10 remained. On the same time, 300,000 ethnic Mongol students went on strike against the policy imposed by Beijing. Even among those ethnic Mongols who support Chinese government, many Mongols objected the plan, with one Mongol, using short video app Kuaishou “I am Chinese, I am Mongolian, you can take anything from me except my mother language. Without language, I cannot say that I am Mongolian,” in a following demonstration against the policy. In 2 September, several ethnic Mongols participated in the raising of khar suld (Black Banner in Mongolian). The khar suld has an implied connotation used only when Mongols fought against an enemy. Reactions =China= The Chinese media like Xinhua News Agency and China Daily have largely ignored the protests and its demands at first, instead focusing on the planned festivals held in Inner Mongolia to social life of ethnic Mongols. However, at the same time, Chinese officials traveled to Inner Mongolia trying to persuade families to send their children back to schools, although there was a strong objection from Mongol families. On 4 September, Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times accused western press of \\"disinformation\\" with regard to bilingual education policy. On the same time, State Councilor and police minister Zhao Kezhi visited the region to strengthen the fight against “terrorism and separatism” during a tour to parts of the province. Chinese police of the region offering a 1,000 yuan bounty for anyone who could identify people participating in anti-government protests. On the same time, Chinese police force has been deployed and increasing its activities across Inner Mongolia, with a number of people arrested for supporting the protests. Families that refused to send children to schools may be stripped of social benefits by the government. On 4 September, an journalist for Los Angeles Times was allegedly detained for 4 hours before being expelled by the Chinese authorities for her coverage. On 13 September, some counties's government require guardians to send their children to school or they will be fined for up to 5000 yuan in response to student protest. =Taiwan= In Taipei, Former Council of Indigenous Peoples minister Yohani Isqaqavut, front, who is a Presbyterian pastor, and other members of the church’s Indigenous Ministry Committee hold placards at a rally outside the Legislative Yuan in Taipei yesterday to express support for people in China’s Inner Mongolia.https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2020/09/12/2003743263 =International= Many Mongols were outraged following the reports, although economic dependence on China largely undermines the opportunity to help. Dozens of Mongolian protesters marched to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarter in Ulaanbaatar demanded reaction against ongoing repression of Mongol rights in China. Ethnic Mongols in Japan also joined the protest campaign, led by Inner Mongolian-based professor Yang Hai from Shizuoka University, against the newly-established bilingual education campaign that was deemed to be downgrading Mongolian language status. The leader of the IMPP, Temtsiltu Shobtsood, who lives in exile in Germany, accused China of \\"trying to suppress\\" the Mongolian language.

The ranch is located in the unincorporated community of Cherry Valley at the northwestern end of the San Gorgonio Pass. The Ranch and it's immediate neighborhood are known as the community of Highland Springs. Formerly a stagecoach stop on the Bradshaw Trail, owned by Dr. Isaac Smith, the ranch became a hotel turned health resort by Fred S. Hirsch and his brother William in 1927. The location was frequented by numerous historical figures, including Wyatt Earp, Ernest Hemingway, and Albert Einstein. The property, now under the care of Highland Springs president Tina Kummerle, encompasses 2400 acres and comprises one of California’s largest organic lavender farms, a restaurant, inn, and camp.  History  Spanish explorers first visited the area surrounding Highland Springs, known as San Gorgonio Rancho, with missionaries in the late 1700s. They established Mission San Gabriel Arcangel in 1771 to serve as a center for proselytizing the Native Americans. Under a Spanish Land Grant, notorious peacekeeper, Paulino Weaver, owned most of the San Gorgonio Rancho territory. According to historian Ken Edwards, Paulino acquired Rheumatoid Fever and was nursed to health by a passerby named Dr. Isaac Smith. Edward’s asserts that Smith was ultimately gifted one-third of the interest of the San Gorgonio property, then was later transferred ownership of the entire land. Dr. Isaac Smith founded Smith’s Ranch, later known as Smith's Station, on October 10, 1853. By 1862, it became a stagecoach stop along the Butterfield Overland Mail route. The notorious Hall and Wilkinson Stagecoach robbery murder of 1862 occurred on the property while under Dr. Isaac’s ownership. From 1864 to 1866, Smith’s Station was the first stop in Highland Springs along the Bradshaw Trail. It was also the single connecting line for passenger mail as well as the express travel between Southern California and the eastern regions of the United States, including Yuma, Arizona. In 1884 Smith’s Station was purchased by an unspecified Los Angeles company, where one of the owners, named Veile, opened a three-story hotel on the property called Highland Home Hotel. Following the planting of the first cherry trees on the Highland property, Cherry Valley became the name of the surrounding area. Highland Home Hotel was bought by Palmer and Halliday of Santa Ana in 1888. Palmer and Halliday planted a huge acreage of fruit trees on the land. In 1921, the hotel was bought and renamed, Highland Springs Hotel. Highland also served as an all-girls camp called Highland Lassie Lodge in the early 1920s. In 1927, Fred S. Hirsch and his brother Will W. Hirsch bought Smith’s old property and developed it into a vegetarian health resort called Highland Springs Resort. After allegedly being healed through Prof. Arnold Ehret’s methods, Fred Hirsch implemented the teaching of Prof. Ehret and ran a vegetarian restaurant serving produce grown on the property. Highland Springs Resort became known as “The Last Resort” because people who were unable to heal through traditional medicine, travelled to Highland Springs for Hirsch’s help to recover.[1] One of the famous visitors of Highland Springs was Albert Einstein, a personal friend of the Hirsch family, who often came to the resort during his visits to Caltech. Other celebrity visitors include, Bob Hope, Elizabeth Taylor, Ernest Hemingway, and Roy Rogers. In 1948, the Rosin brothers (Stanley, Elmer, & Victor) bought Highland Springs Resort and endeavored to develop the land into a “Catskills of the West” for Jewish families, which included various outdoor activities including tennis, swimming, horseback riding, dancing, music, and entertainment. Highland Springs Resort Hotel burned down under ownership of the Rosin brothers in 1970.[1] In May 1990, Highland Springs Ranch & Inn (formerly Highland Springs Resort Hotel) was purchased by a South Korean corporation under the leadership of inventor and natural health enthusiast Yoo Byung-eun.  The Resort Today  Under Yoo’s ownership in 2001, Highland Springs recruited a farmer named Tina Kummerle. According to Jessy Beckett, a few months into taking the farmer position, the president stepped down and the board appointed Tina as Highland Springs’ new president. Kummerle graduated with a degree in environmental science from Colorado College and has plans to make Highland Springs more sustainably eco-friendly. In 2009, Highland Springs was renovated. Reviving of the property included constructing a more modern building on a different site, and a revamping of the lobby and guest rooms. The resort now contains an organic farm, a science camp for children, olive groves, and the largest certified organic lavender farm (20 acres) in Southern California. The Grand Oak Farm to Table restaurant is named for a thousand- year-old oak tree residing on the property, and most of the food served at the restaurant is produced at the onsite farm. The ranch hosts its Lavender Festival from June to July which celebrates the beginning of lavender harvest season, where many lavender products are made and sold. Highland Springs also hosts the Annual Sausage and Beer Festival, the Annual Olive & Wine Faire, and several others. During festivals, Highland Springs’ farmers offer workshops and showcase the farm’s organic produce. The ranch offers live music, hiking, and photoshoots for amateur photographers. Highland’s Springs Resort management intends to preserve the “historic character and charm of the property.”  References  Category:Tourist attractions in Riverside County, California Category:Landmarks of Riverside County, California Category:Agriculture in Riverside County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Riverside County, California Category:San Gorgonio Pass ","title":"Highland Springs Resort/Ranch &amp; Inn"},{"id":"65199493","text":"Cult of Jester was the music project of West Lafayette-based composer Ed Finkler.

Remote and known for the steep 14% grade gravel access road, the park offers campsites with minimal amenities and is open to fishing, hiking, boating, sea kayaking and sightseeing.The campground is closed from October to mid May due to winter concerns. History In 1970, Clem Tillion, a member of the State House and Senator Bob Palmer, both Republicans, introduced legislation to set aside 300,000 acres of land in Kachemak Bay to create the first state park and wilderness area. On May 9, 1970, the Alaska Legislature established the park at Kachemak Bay and authorized the governor to set aside additional lands as state parks. Within five months from May to October, the park system grew to 913,000 acres. A park near Haines, to be named Chilkat State Park, was included in this and later that year the northern segment, initially called \\"Battery Point State Recreation Area\\", was opened. The full park was not enacted until five years later in 1975 and, in a governor proclamation on June 22, 1976, the northern and newly created southern segments were renamed Chilkat State Park. The original park was 6,056.3 acres but has grown through the years by private donation and legislative action. Looking out Chilkat Inlet from the Takshanuk Mountains. The tip of the Chilkat Peninsula can be seen in the background. Fishing and boating The park offers plenty of opportunities for anglers. The Chilkat River is considered the most productive coho spawning and rearing area in Southeast Alaska, which also provides a habitat for wild sockeye, Chinook and chum salmon. In June boaters can enter the inlets for the King salmon run using the parks boat launch. To the south of the park, across the inlets, is Chilkat Islands State Marine Park and Sullivan Island State Marine Park which offer boaters additional areas to explore and more sights to see. Sea kayaking is also a way to get around the inlets surrounding the park. Due to the shallow waters surrounding many of the channel islands a kayaker can get into places boaters can't to spy on the many wildlife species that make their home in the area. Hiking and sightseeing A bald eagle near Chilkat State Park The park offers hikers three trails of varying degrees of difficulty. For a more smooth hike, one can take the Seduction Point Trail that stays close to the coastline and weaves its way through forest and beach for about seven miles. Another easy trail to take is the Battery Point Trail. Its two mile length starts in the forest and ends on the beach. For the more adventurous hiker there is Mount Riley Trail with its steep vertical rises but also offers the hiker a view of the entire park and inlets. =Wildlife viewing= Because the park is very remote, a patient visitor may have many opportunities to see a variety of wildlife. Black and brown bears, mountain goats and even moose frequent the park and surrounding areas. There are spotting scopes located at the information center that allow visitors to see wildlife far out into the inlet. This includes humpback and orca, harbor seals, harbor porpoises and Steller sea lions. Quite a few different species of birds can be spotted around the park as well. One of the favorites of visitors is the bald eagle but others can be found like the trumpeter swan, boreal owl, common loon and kingfisher. =Mountain and glacier viewing= Davidson Glacier, Haines, Alaska, USA Chilkat State Park and, more generally, the Haines area are situated at the convergence of North America's interior and the waters of the Inside Passage. As such is the case the small peninsula is surrounded by deep channels and steep rising mountains. The Chilkat Range, Takinsha Mountains, Takshanuk Mountains and Coast Mountains all meet at this point and provides many views of mountain peaks close to open waters. Because we are talking about Alaska the park does offer a view of two major glaciers in the area. The first is Rainbow Glacier, which is about 1.5 miles long and sits at an elevation of 5164 feet (1574 meters) and is a hanging glacier with a waterfall dropping from its face. The larger of the two glaciers is Davidson Glacier. At about 4.6 miles long and at an elevation of 3875 feet (1181 meters), the glacier was named after George Davidson, a geographer whose published report influenced the purchase of Alaska from Russia by the United States in 1867.

In the foreground passes the Orlegna River, which is deflected southwestwards (left) by the Engadine Line Engadine Line is an over long strike-slip fault in the Swiss canton of Graubünden, which extends into Italy and Austria. It runs along the Engadine Valley, which formed on the fault, and the Bregaglia Valley and offsets Austroalpine and Penninic units in sinistral direction. The western end of the fault appears to peter out into ductile deformation in the Bregaglia Valley or continues as the Gruf Line, the eastern end is buried by the Ötztal tectonic block and may continue as the Inntal, Isar or Loisach faults. Total offset along the Engadine Line is about , decreasing southwest. It began in the Oligocene but there is evidence of recent neotectonic activity, which resulted in the collapse of the Maloja pass area at the beginning of the Holocene. Seismic activity occurs along the Engadine Line, and springs and carbon dioxide exhalations in the Engadine are linked to the fault.  Geology  The Engadine Line is an over long northeast-trending fault in Switzerland. It is a steeply dipping left-lateral strike-slip fault that cuts to a depth of . The total slip on the Engadine Line decreases from in the Lower Engadine to in the Upper Engadine and at Sils, Maloja. The fault trace is generally not recognizable on the surface as it is buried beneath alluvium; the only outcrops are found at Maloja and at Stragliavita close to Zernez. The towns of Bever, Maloja, Nauders, S-chanf, Samedan, Sils, St. Moritz, Vicosoprano and Zernez are located along the Engadine Line, as is the Albigna Dam. Parts of the Engadine Line were already recognized by 1914, but it was only in 1977 that they were identified as belonging to a single fault zone, reportedly after a suggestion by a Chinese geologist. Sometimes the names \\"Nassereith- Silz fault\\" and \\"Scuols-Vils fault\\" are used in the context of the Engadine Line, which was originally also known as . The Engadine Line deforms the Austroalpine and Penninic nappes and also appears in magnetic anomaly maps. It is responsible for the geologic differences between Graubünden north and south of the Engadine. The Engadine Line is sometimes considered to be a branch of the Periadriatic Line. The movement on the Engadine Line is part of a larger tectonic process in the Alps, whereby the mountain range is compressed in north-south direction and is thus squeezed upwards and eastwards. Of the numerous fault zones in the Eastern Alps, the Engadine Line and its northeastern extensions are the longest. Evidence for a vertical component in fault motion and its interpretation is conflicting; the block southeast of the fault has a down-to-the-east component with normal slip in the northeastern sector of the Engadine Line that may be part of east-west extension in the Alps while the sector in the Bregaglia Valley features an uplifting northwestern block with reverse slip which may be a recent change in fault motion. Vertical offset on the Engadine Line appears to have opposite direction east and west of Samedan-St. Moritz and has been interpreted as a rotational movement of tectonic blocks. The Churer uplift influenced the western side of the Engadine Line and generated eastward tilting. = Geomorphology = In the Lower Engadine, the Engadine Line separates the Silvretta covers from the Engadine Window and the Ötztal Alps block which appears to bury the Engadine Line in part. The movement along the Engadine Line may have generated the Engadine Window by exposing Penninic rock units. The Schlining Thrust, which separates the Austroalpine Ötztal unit in the east from the Sesvenna-Campo-Silvretta units in the west, joins the Engadine Line in Austria. On its eastern end the Engadine Line may reach into the Northern Calcareous Alps and can be traced as far as the town of Imst in Austria; it may reach as far as Innsbruck. The Inntal fault is probably the northeastern continuation of the Engadine Line and has a maximum offset of , reaching the Molasse basin. The Loisach and the Isar faults are other candidate prolongations of the Engadine Line; alternatively the former has been interpreted as a parallel fault that splits up in the Wetterstein Mountains. Later movements in the Ötztal Alps area may have overprinted the trace of the Engadine Line there. It is conjugated with dextral strike-slip faults in the Northern Calcareous Alps. The Inn Valley formed along the Engadine Line. There, the fault runs e.g between the villages La Punt and St. Moritz. In the Samedan area, geologic research has found evidence of releasing bends and restraining bends associated with Miocene movement along the Engadine Line as well as of normal faults linked to the Engadine Line. At Zernez the river departs the Engadine Line before returning at Scuol. The Engadine Line might form the northwestern border of the Scarl-Campo rock units. The combined effects of glacial erosion and slip along the Engadine Line generated the Lej da Segl, Lej da Silvaplauna, Lej da Champfèr and Lej da San Murezzan lakes which are traversed by the Inn River. In the Upper Engadine and the Maloja Pass area the Engadine Line is represented by long northeast-trending fault segments and long east-west trending fault segments which form scarps. Depressions located between the fault traces are occupied by lakes such as Silsersee, Silvaplanersee and St. Moritzsee, which do not appear to be moraine-dammed and may have been formed by the activity of the Engadine Line. Close to the Maloja Pass the Engadine Line forms a single fault. In the Forno Valley, the fault crops out in the form of polished surfaces, scarps and striations along with fault gouge. The course of the Orlegna River is diverted by a shutter ridge at the intersection with the Engadine Line. There, the Engadine Line runs along the southern side of the Inn and Bregaglia Valleys and is accompanied by deep-seated mass failures; eventually it disappears under sediments and close to Promontogno. As with the Inn Valley, the Bregaglia Valley is the surface expression of the Engadine Line. The Engadine Line continues as the \\"Gruf Line\\", which runs along the southern side of the valley, accompanied by deep-seated mass failures which obscure the surface presentation of the Gruf Line, and crosses into Italian territory. The Gruf Line appears to be based in deeper, more ductile crustal domains than the Engadine Line and it is possible that part of the offset is taken up by ductile stress along the Bregaglia Valley. Alternative interpretations see the Gruf Line as a mylonite zone, identify another lineament between Maloja and Chiavenna or prolong the Engadine Line to Chiavenna and even farther. The Gruf line separates the Gruf migmatites from the Chiavenna ophiolites and the Tambo nappe. It and the Gruf Line accommodate the exhumation of the Bergell pluton, which was tilted to the east between the Engadine Line and the Periadriatic Line. A transition from brittle faulting on the Engadine Line to ductile deformation in the western Bregaglia Valley might explain why the Engadine Line does not appear to continue there. Deformation in rocks formations of the Bregaglia Valley may related to activity of the Engadine Line. Structural lineaments related to the Engadine Line can be traced as far as the Valle San Giacomo west of the Bregaglia.  Geologic history  Movement along the Engadine Line commenced during or before the late Oligocene but post-dates the cooling of the Bergell pluton 28 million years ago. Movement took place during the Oligocene before probably ceasing during the Miocene and has been attributed to the so-called \\"Turba phase\\" of extensional development of the Alps. The movement along the Engadine Line and Inntal faults influenced the course of the Inn River, allowed its watershed to expand southwestwards and altered drainages during the Sarmatium. = Neotectonics = There is very little information on the recent activity of the Engadine Line. Detecting faults in the Alps is difficult, as glacial and fluvial erosion as well as gravitational processes and landslides quickly erase evidence of tectonic processes. Earthquakes are often poorly documented in the thinly populated Alps, they tend to be weak and often cannot be linked to specific faults. There are only few indications of recent activity, and it is not agreed upon that it was active during the Upper Pleistocene-Holocene although evidence of Quaternary movement is widely found. The Engadine Line and other lineaments delimit a fast uplifting area of the Central Alps. In the Val Laschadura close to Zernez post-glacial faulting is recorded. Traces of multiple glaciations are preserved in the Forno Valley. Deposits left by the most recent glaciation are unaffected by tectonic activity at the Engadine Line but the Orlegna River has not yet recovered from the impact of faulting, implying that movement along the Engadine Line there took place before 14,500 years ago but in the Late Pleistocene. Fault scarps in the Inn Valley associated with the Engadine Line have been degraded by glaciation. On the other hand, sackungen in the Bregaglia Valley which post-date the last glacial maximum have been linked to tectonic activity on the Gruf Line which otherwise shows no evidence of Quaternary activity. The deformation in the western Inn Valley-Bregaglia Valley may be of gravitational origin, however, although earthquakes on the Engadine Line may have triggered their movement. The \\"beheading\\" of the Inn Valley at Maloja Pass, which took place between 29,400 - 14,500 years before present, is one of the major geologic events in the Quaternary of this sector of the Alps. Three valleys that formerly presumably fed the Inn Glacier but were redirected into the Bregaglia Valley by a large collapse that caused the \\"beheading\\". Tectonic stresses exercised by movements along the Engadine Line may have caused the collapse which left a steep escarpment at Maloja Pass and a large elevation difference between the Inn and Bregaglia valleys.  Seismicity  Minor seismic activity occurs in the Engadine and appears to relate to, in part, northeast-southwest trending structures such as the Engadine Line. Earthquakes have been localized to the Engadine Line, but they are not intense and seismicity disappears into the Inn Valley where the Engadine Line fault continues. It decreases southwestwards away from the central and eastern Engadine. Seismic activity in the Venosta Valley may be related to the intersection between the Engadine Line and a north-south trending fault. Turbidites in Lake Como and Lake Sils, dated to have occurred in AD 700, may relate to Engadine earthquakes. In the Ötz River valley in Austria, the Engadine Line and the Inntal fault show increased earthquake activity, which may relate to the occurrence of frequent landslides in the area. It is possible, but unproven, that the Engadine Line may generate earthquakes. Research published in 1979 indicated that earthquakes on the Engadine Line might reach a maximum magnitude of 5.5 or 6.9 with a break length of .  Exhalations and springs  Hydrothermal activity has been associated with recent activity on the Engadine Line. In the Scuol-Tarasp area, mineral water and carbon dioxide rise to the surface (the latter forming mofette)s along the Engadine Line and its intersection with more local geologic lineaments. The waters most likely form along the plane of the fault.

It resulted from the split in 2016 of the municipality of Ettadhamen-Mnihla with the creation of a separate municipality in Mnihla. This popular city, whose name means \\"solidarity\\", was created in the 1950s with the arrival of populations from internal migration. A former district built illegally, it was then integrated into the urban plan of the Tunisian agglomeration.  History  Ettadhamen was formed by the waves of internal migration (poor, small farmers and unemployed) that marked Tunisia in the early 1950s, during the presidency of Habib Bourguiba, when hundreds of families left their poor villages in the northwestern governorates (Siliana, Beja, Jendouba and Le Kef) for the suburbs of the capital. The neighborhood's youth played a central role in the 2011 revolution which overthrew President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali because they aspired to change their difficult living conditions, but without success. If traces of the main contributors to the popular uprising are still present on the walls of the houses and surrounding alleys, infrastructure projects in fact remain absent in the region till this day, which contributed to the deterioration of the situation and the spread of crime, with drug trafficking and a high level of frustration and deprivation among young people, most of whom choose illegal migration. Militant Islamist movements are also developing and certain jihadist cells are emerging, especially among the youth. Before Ettadhamen-Mnihla split into two separate municipalities (Ettadhamen and Mnihla) in 2016, the complex was inhabited by nearly 142,953 people (2014).  Economy  The political transition of the Tunisian state after the 2011 revolution contributed to the state of economic stagnation, with an increase in the number of university graduates and an absence of a comprehensive strategy offering radical solutions to reduce the unemployment rate. This is estimated at more than 60%, while the poverty rate is 70%, because the monthly income of thousands of families does not exceed 200 dinars, while it reached 27.88% for higher graduates in 2014.  Culture  = Youth centers = Ettadhamen is equipped with a multidisciplinary complex whose mission is to train young people and develop their talents in a number of fields, such as music, theater and reading. It was inaugurated by President Béji Caïd Essebsi in 2018. = Summer festivals = The district has its own festival which is held annually from the end of July to the first week of August. In 2019, the local community celebrated the 33rd edition of the festival which is considered one of the few entertainment events available. The festival brings together activities of all types, but above all concerts and sometimes plays.  Sport  According to a study carried out by a group of sociologists on young people from Douar Hicher and Ettadhamen, 55% of active associations are focusing on sports while are 18.5% non-profit, 10.3% are cultural and 10.5% religious. This study states that only one in four young people know at least one active association in their neighborhood. Sports clubs perform their activities in the indoor hall at the 14th of January hall or at the municipal stadium. The first one was built in 2003 at a cost of 850,000 dinars, hosts wrestling, weightlifting and boxing trainings and competitions while the second was completed in 1989 for an investment of 120,000 dinars and renovated in 2008 at a cost of 150,000 dinars. This reflects the strategy that the various governments follow to encourage local sporting activities and invest in the human potential of the population.

Early life and activities Rivella was born in Moncalieri and grew up in the Mirafiori Sud neighborhood of Turin. Rivella was ordained a priest of the diocese of Turin in 1998. He held the role of avvocato generale in the diocesan curia and taught canon law in the seminary and theological faculty. He served as director of the juridical office of the Episcopal Conference of Italy (CEI) and then as its subsecretary. During Rivella's term as subsecretary of the CEI, the anti-abuse activist Roberto Mirabile accused Rivella and three other CEI leaders of mishandling a report of priestly pedophilia that Mirabile had submitted to the CEI. When Rivella's 5-year term as CEI subsecretary was not renewed, he returned to the diocese of Turin to serve as a parish priest in Chieri, but was called back to Rome to serve in APSA after less than a year, a nomination that some saw as a rebuke to CEI leadership. He also served as a consultant for the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. APSA In 2013, Rivella was appointed delegate of the ordinary section of APSA, the branch of the agency that administers the goods of the Holy See, including real estate. In July 2014, the functions of the ordinary section were transferred to the Secretariat for the Economy before being transferred back to APSA in July 2016. In 2015, Rivella was named secretary of APSA. At the time, he was identified by several commentators as a perceived ally of Cardinal George Pell. =IDI loan and Papal Foundation grant= During Rivella's time at APSA, the entity engaged in a controversial series of activities related to a loan made to an entity associated with the Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata (IDI), a hospital in Rome originally owned by the Italian province of the Sons of the Immaculate Conception (PICFIC), which had gone bankrupt after being used as a vehicle for embezzlement and money laundering. In 2015, after having been rebuffed after a similar request to the Institute for the Works of Religion (IOR), the Vatican's commercial bank, the temporary administrator of PICFIC and commissioner of the IDI, Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi, along with Giovanni Angelo Becciu, the substitute of the Vatican Secretariat of State, sought a 50 million euro loan from APSA to the Fondazione Luigi Maria Monti (FLMM), a for- profit partnership of the Vatican Secretariat of State and the Congregation of the Sons of the Immaculate Conception that had been created to take over the IDI and nominally replace PICFIC as the owner of the hospital. APSA granted the loan to the FLMM, possibly in contravention of international regulatory agreements not to provide commercial loans, and in April 2015 the FLMM acquired the IDI for a reported 131 million euros. In order to remove the loan from APSA's books, officials from the Secretariat of State sought a $25 million grant in June 2017 from the U.S.-based Papal Foundation, whose lay board members were reportedly initially led to believe that the money would go to the IDI rather than to the Holy See. In July 2017, Rivella met personally in Washington, DC, with Theodore McCarrick, then a cardinal and a member of the Papal Foundation's board, who pushed aggressively for the approval of the loan throughout the next year. The grant request created turmoil inside the Papal Foundation, and the disbursement of funds was repeatedly stalled; in the end, the $13 million already disbursed to the Holy See was reclassified as a \\"loan\\" against future foundation grants. In October 2019, APSA President Nunzio Galantino stated that APSA had had to write off 30 million euros of the loan after the Papal Foundation grant was stopped. In November 2019, Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin claimed that he was personally responsible for the APSA loan to the FLMM and the request to the Papal Foundation. =Audit information request= On May 3 and 5, 2017, Rivella sent letters to the dicasteries of the Holy See and related institutions, asking them to provide financial information to their banks and legal and fiscal consultants so that the data could be transmitted in turn to Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), which Rivella stated was carrying out auditing activities for the Holy See. On May 8, a letter of reply sent to the same entities by Cardinal Pell and Libero Milone of the Secretariat for the Economy stated that APSA did not have the authority to request this information or to provide it to an outside auditing firm, and further stated that PwC's audit of the Vatican had been suspended in 2016. Post-APSA After the conclusion of his 5-year term as secretary of APSA, Rivella returned to the diocese of Turin as the pastor of the church of St. Rita. Rivella has reportedly been rumored to be a candidate for various bishoprics in northern Italy.

Features Pollardstown Fen was legally protected as a national nature reserve by the Irish government in 1986. It is also a Special Area of Conservation and is deemed to be of international importance as a habitat. 60% of the fen is owned by the Irish state, and its designation as a reserve was in response to drainage schemes from the 1960s which converted parts of the fen into agricultural land. In 1990, the site was also declared Ramsar site number 474. Pollardstown Fen is the largest spring- fed calcareous alkaline fen still extant in Ireland, fed from the Curragh Aquifier with petrifying springs. Among the notable species found on the site are Cladium mariscus, Caricion davallianae, Vertigo geyeri, Vertigo angustior, and Vertigo moulinsiana. The site's flora is dominated by black bog rush and saw sedge, with other species recorded including the fly orchid, western bladderwort, sphagnum moss and broad-leaved bog cotton. A large number of birds are found on the reserve such as sand martins, skylarks, mute swans, herons, little grebe, coots, moorhens, reed buntings, water rails, snipe, sedge warblers, pintail and tufted ducks. Other animals that inhabit the area include otters, hares, pygmy shrews, and smooth newts. There is a boardwalk at the site for visitors. The fen was impacted for a time by the side-effects from the construction of the Kildare by-pass in 2003, when the water levels in the fen were disrupted.

Hadhad is a Cofounder of Peace by Chocolate. He is also a motivational speaker. Life before Canada and education Prior to being forced to flee from Syria during the country's civil war, Hadhad's father, Essam Hadhad made chocolate in Damascus, Syria for over 20 years. Their facilities in Syria were bombed, and Tareq and his family were forced to leave their home and live as refugees in Lebanon for three years, living in uncertainty about their safety and their future until arriving in Canada in 2016. Previous to being forced to leave Syria, Tareq had completed four years of Medical School and was well on his way to becoming a Doctor. With two years left in his schooling, it was no longer safe to attend school in Syria. While living in Lebanon, Hadhad provided medical services to those in need. After arriving in Canada, Hadhad started his Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/refugee-roadblock- doctor-antigonish-syrian-1.3519565 After immigrating to Nova Scotia in 2016, Hadhad reopened the family’s chocolatier business. They are now thriving in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, employing newcomers to Canada and residents of the community. Its confectionery is shipped worldwide. Coming to Canada Upon arriving in Canada in the middle of a cold December night in 2015, as a Syrian Refugee, Hadhad was greeted by a large group of people clapping and cheering for him, holding signs and waving Canadian flags. They were a group of refugee sponsors from Antigonish, who wanted to offer him and his family a safe and happy life in Canada. The rest of Tareq's family would shortly follow and land in Canada to begin their new lives. Soon after settling in their new home, the Hadhad family began selling their Peace by Chocolate brand at local farmers’ markets. Over time, sales and attention towards the company and its chocolates grew. Peace by Chocolate Peace by Chocolate began as a small kitchen-based operation and has since grown into a nationally distributed business with plans to employ up to 500 staff in the next two years. Chocolate-making has been a Hadhad family tradition since 1986 when Essam Hadhad, Tareq's father, opened a factory in Damascus. Upon arriving in Canada, the Hadhad's were determined to continue their confectionary business by launching a facility in Antigonish. After the initial great success at local farmers’ markets, the company made its products available online which expanded their reach significantly. In 2018, the company signed a deal with Empire Co.’s Sobeys grocery store chain, providing national distribution throughout Canada via 900 stores within two years. This helped to increase Peace by Chocolate sales by 400 percent in 2018.https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/local/trudeau- presents-pelosi-with-antigonish-syrian-refugees-chocolate-325107/ Hadhad wants Peace by Chocolate to become one of this country’s biggest chocolate companies in five years.https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/business/local-business/new- citizen-tareq-hadhad-has-ambitious-plans-for-his-peace-by- chocolate-384326/?fbclid=IwAR1Z343qTxorV9i8vuYfMOD6i5OpPmva6RwUqZKlaCdg2DQvpISulS1-RKE Prime Minister Trudeau's Support of Peace by Chocolate Trudeau gave Peace by Chocolate its first international nod in 2016, sharing the story of the Hadhad family to a forum of world leaders, diplomats and dignitaries at the UN Refugee Summit in 2016. In June 2019, Trudeau supported Hadhad and his family during a trip to the U.S. by gifting U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with Peace by Chocolate, stating, “Peace by Chocolate is something Canada is very proud of”, to which she replied, “Peace by Chocolate, sounds like an International Agreement.\\" The Hadhad family view Peace by Chocolate as a way to give back to Antigonish, the small town of roughly 4,500 with an 11.6 unemployment rate. Peace by Chocolate's goal is to employ over 500 people within this community and is a surefire way of giving back to those who so graciously welcome Hadhad and his family. Peace On Earth Society and Giving Back Peace By Chocolate donates 3–5% of all company profits to their Peace On Earth Society – an organization registered in Nova Scotia that donates funds to peacebuilding projects around the world. Peace by Chocolate also has permanent donations agreements with specific organizations. Their Peace Needs Love Pride Bars donate one dollar per bar sold to Phoenix Youth in Halifax, NS. Their Nitap Indigenous Friendship Bars give proceeds towards the Paq’tnkek Band Council and the Paq’tnkek Mi'kmaw Nation. Peace by Chocolate also donated $10,000 in support of the Paq’tnek 12-week Nitap (friendship) program in collaboration with the Paqtnkek Community Health Center, the Municipality of the County of Antigonish Recreation Department and volunteers. The program is said to have brought together community members on a variety of projects and represent an excellent collaboration with our neighbours and community organizers to help support community health and well-being. Another partnership is between Peace by Chocolate and the University of Ottawa's Refugee Hub. Their Welcome Bar acts as a fundraising initiative designed to promote the values that best define Canada and to benefit newcomers on Canadian soil. The Ottawa University Refugee Hub works to increase protection and rights for refugees by engaging in research, programming, and partnerships on a community, national, and international level. Proceeds from the Welcome Bar helps them continue their work and bring together refugee-related research & activities within the Faculty of Law and on the University of Ottawa campus. In January 2020, the company launched their Peace of Mind campaign, directing proceeds from their Peace of Mind Bars to the Canadian Mental Health Association. In 2016, Hadhad and Peace by Chocolate helped the tens of thousands of Canadians displaced by wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta by donating a portion of the proceeds from their company to the Red Cross to help those evacuated from their homes living in shelters. Hadhad and his family's experience with losing everything in Syria made them want to give back to the people of Canada. Citizenship On January 15, 2020, Hadhad participated in a citizenship ceremony at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in Halifax. Hadhad received a 100% score on his Canadian citizenship test. Public speaking Hadhad has said that Peace by Chocolate is not just about making chocolate, but is an opportunity to share with the world a message of peace. Hadhad gave his first speech in February 2016 after being asked to speak at a community breakfast. Although he was incredibly nervous and was still mastering his English, he attended and spoke about his experience in Syria and Lebanon, as well as his fresh start in Canada. He ended up speaking for an hour and 15 minutes. This helped him to realize his talent for public speaking. He has now spoken all across Canada and has attended over 350 speaking engagements from Coast to Coast to share the story of his family and Peace by Chocolate.https://canadianimmigrant.ca/people/entrepreneur- immigrants/from-chocolatier-to-speaker-tareq-hadhad Hadhad's speaking engagement topics are \\"Resiliency through Adversity: Perseverance from Pre-War Syria to the United Nation\\", \\"One Peace Won't Hurt: Building a cause through Entrepreneurship and Community\\", and \\"Peace is Beautiful in Every Language: How Offering Kindness is the Key to Accelerating the Integration of New Immigrants\\". \\"I want people to realize how important it is to keep peace in our lives and how important it is to open our doors and welcome people from other countries.

The 97-meter-high tower was the tallest landmark of the city for centuries. The church was the starting point of the Reformation in Bremen. The building was severely damaged during World War II and the ruin was demolished in the 1950s. A new church building under the same name was constructed outside of the old city.  History  The name and tradition of St. Ansgarii go back to around 850, when Archbishop Ansgar of Bremen, known as the \\"Apostle of the North\\", established a foundation for twelve clergy here. Ansgar was later buried in Bremen in 865. In the late 12th century, Archbishop Hartwig II set up a collegiate monastery with twelve canons, with the task of building a basilica in honor of St. Ansgar. This original Brick Gothic parish church was consecrated in 1243 and converted into a hall church at the end of the 14th century. The main tower on the west side was not completed until the 14th century. After a fire in 1590, a canopy was added to the top and the tower reached its final height of about 97 meters.Herbert Schwarzwälder: Das Große Bremen-Lexikon 2nd edition. Temmen, Bremen 2003, A sermon by the Dutch Augustinian monk Heinrich von Zütphen, a colleague of Martin Luther, in the Ansgarii church was the starting point for the Reformation in Bremen in 1522 emphasizing the theological and historical importance of the St. Ansgarii community for the history of Bremen. The tower steeple, the tallest in the city, was used as the center point for the first Bremen land survey in 1797 and served mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauß for further triangulation surveys in 1824. These events are commemorated on a metal plaque on the \\"Ansgarikirchhof\\" city square.Kittel, C., Knight, W.D., Ruderman, M.A., Helmholz, A.C., Moyer, B.J.: Mechanik. Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg 2001, The church was severely damaged in the air raids on Bremen during World War II. The main tower collapsed on September 1, 1944 and damaged further elements of the church. The ruin was demolished in the 1950s and the \\"Bremer Carreé\\" city block and shopping center was built in its place.Bremer Carreé: Ansgarihaus that replaced the original Ansgarii church A new church building under the same name was constructed in 1955-57 in the outer city district of Schwachhausen, serving as the new center for the Ansgarii church community. Some elements of the medieval church like the pulpit and elaborate stone epitaphs survived and were placed inside the new church building. The memorial \\"Ansgar column\\" was installed in 1965 on the \\"Ansgarikirchhof\\" city square in honor of the 1100th anniversary of the death of St. Ansgar and in memory of the destruction of St. Ansgarii church in 1944. The bronze column forms a Bible, ship and cross: the symbols of Ansgar's mission. A group of citizens formed the committee \\"Anschari e.V. - Association for the historical cityscape of Bremen\\" which promotes the reconstruction of the Ansgarii Church and the demolition of the \\"Bremer Carreé\\" city block that was built in its place.

Newbold organised pacifist and Marxist activism in 1917 - 1920s across the UK, and was one of the first British people to visit Russia after the revolution when she travelled incognito into Russia with delegates including Sylvia Pankhurst, to the Second World Congress of the Comintern (Communist International)  Family life and education  Born Marjory Neilson on 25 May 1883, she was the eldest of four children of Alexander Neilson (born 1859 in Arbroath, Angus) and his wife nee Mary Steven Fettes (born1957, also Arbroath) at Winton Terrace, Beith, Ayrshire. Newbold's father was a Presbyterian and a cabinet-maker, earning enough to send his daughter to higher education after schooling at Beith Academy. Her siblings were Annie (born 1886) and Eliza (born 1889) and brother Alexander (1892-1980), who in January 1917 was imprisoned for refusing to serve as a soldier in World War I. By 1891, the family had moved to 14 New Street, Beith, and had a boarder Archibald Flemington, a french polisher. Newbold studied from 1902-1905 at Glasgow University, but did not have sufficient grades to graduate in the arts, perhaps as she became a political activist whilst a student. Newbold went on to teach at Wishaw elementary state school from 1908-1916, being a pupil teacher from 1901. By 1911, Newbold was a school teacher, and herself a boarder with George and Marion Kirkcaldy at 96 Glasgow Road, Wishaw, an industrial area where she saw the deprivation endured by children of working families and poor and limited facilities for their education. Newbold was said to be 'gifted with intellectual abilities of a high order' and had 'warm human sympathies with the struggles of the poor' and she embraced socialist activism to work to improve opportunities in education, health, welfare and housing for the working class. Newbold met John Turner Walton Newbold (1888-1943), a fellow socialist, and a research student from Buxton, Derbyshire, whom she met at a lecture in December 1913, a few months after his previous long engagement to 'Red' Ellen Wilkinson had been called off by his fiancee. Marjory and Walton were engaged in April 1914, and married in a civil ceremony in Blythswood, Glasgow on 16 June 1915. Then, as was required for a married woman, Newbold had to resign her job as a teacher.  Political career  Whilst still a student, Newbold joined the Independent Labour Party and adopted atheist, feminist and socialist beliefs which she put into activism for improving conditions for the working classes. The Wishaw branch of ILP thrived under her leadership, when she 'did a deal of spade work' introducing a socialist Sunday school for children and adults, which grew from 14 to over 60 members, and as well as social time together, provided lectures and literature for developing solidarity and political education to assist in building the movement for social justice. From 1912-16, Newbold took on responsibilities at the divisional council of the Scottish ILP, and became an election agent, and did so again later for her husband in 1922 and 1923. Whilst she was teaching, Newbold had been actively involved in the Scottish Socialist Teachers Society. Newbold became secretary to Wishaw Housing Council, pressing for changes for the working class. After her marriage, her politics became more Marxist and in 1917-18, Newbold was involved in the Hands Off Russia Committee. Newbold led the No Conscription Fellowship for Scotland, and she joined young socialist pacifist activist groups in Edmonton, London. In 1919-20, Newbold established in Manchester a branch of the National League of Working Youth, a more communist group. Within the local ILP, Newbold had acted as the secretary for a more revolutionary left-wing campaign movement, and then she joined the British Communist Party in 1921.  International engagement  On 24 April 1920, the Newbolds were living at 6 Grange Road, Buxton, Derbyshire and Marjory Newbold was the chair of the National Young Labour League and writing in communist press, to encourage donations following resolution of the Conference of the League for Communist Youth (Berlin November 1919) for a memorial circulating collection of the works of Karl Leibknecht, from America, Norway, Sweden, Holland and Italy. During summer 1920, Newbold travelled incognito to Russia, along with other British delegates such as John S. Clarke, Helen Crawfurd, Williie Gallacher, Wlliam McLaine, JT Murphy, Sylvia Pankhurst, Tom Quelch, Dave Ramsay and Jack Tanner and was attending as a voting member to the Second World Congress of the Comintern (Communist International) in Petrograd, Russia. Newbold's six month visit included time in Leningrad, observing the Soviet system. At the Congress, Newbold briefed delegates on the communist movement within ILP and the nascent Communist Party in the UK and learned about the Soviet principles and experience for women and children. Newbold wrote about her experience in Petrograd for The Communist, describing visits to sumptuous palaces that had been taken over for workers' accommodation for recuperation from poverty and malnutrition and in need of health care. Newbold linked this to a call to lift the blockade on Russia by Britain and other nations. Newbold described decor of a palace now the home to 45 factory workers where 'the library, billiard- room, terrace and the grand piano were all being made use of by the workers'. Newbold also found that a former sugar factory owner's 105 room holiday home now housed not a rich couple, but 150 workers, where the head of food provision for the two-week respite was a former chef to Tsar Nicholas II, and seven boats were available for use on the artificial lake. Newbold herself was not physically strong and her fellow delegate Dora Russell, noted that she was: > small, very thin and pale and not unlike the ILP leader James Maxton. Like > so many communists I was to meet then and later she was totally convinced > and dogmatic and willing to make any sacrifice for the cause. I liked > Marjory and her spirit, her courage and her endurance, but her physical > strength was not enough. In April 1921, Newbold formally joined the British Communist Party, with hundreds of ILP members, but was unfit to campaign widely. In 1923, Newbold was a member of Helen Crawfurd's committee raising funds or encouraging donations of clothing for 1,400 of the over 2 million starving and homeless Russian children, along with Evelyn Sharp, George Lansbury MP, Honoria Enfield, Dr V.N. Polovtsev (Russian Red Cross), Mrs Montefiore, Mrs Winifred Horrabin, Mrs CH Norman, Mrs Mark Starr, Ellen Wilkinson, Nellie Lansbury and Mrs Ewer. Division within the woman's international peace movement and the British Communists about the role of women-only groupings, led to Newbold's name and Helen Crawfurd's being removed from the records of the Women's International League, by Ellen Wilkinson. Newbold's speeches for supporting Russian children to the British communists were not as successful as she had originally hoped.  Illness and death  After the International Congress, Newbold's health deteriorated, coming home 'a shadow of her former self' with a 'lingering illness from which she was never to recover' due to a fatal infection of tuberculosis, which prevented her continuing active political leadership. Newbold remained committed to 'the great cause of the international commonwealth' and remained a Communist to the end of her life. When her husband, Walton declared for Labour rather than Communist candidate for Derby in 1926, Newbold was described as an 'invalid', and regretted that her poor health had prevented her assisting Walton Newbold in serving as Wishaw's M.P. Locally Walton was known as 'Madge's man' in the socialist and working class community of Motherwell-Wishaw. On 15 November 1926, Newbold died at home in Bellscauseway, Beith. Newbold is buried in Beith Cemetery. Despite her short career, Marjory Newbold had made a 'distinctive contribution to the labour and socialist movement', she was 'known to many in the Labour movement in Wishaw' and news of her sudden death was expected in her obituary to be 'received with keen regret'.

The law provides support mechanisms and medications to individuals suffering from substance abuse disorder. It also provides protection to pharmacists and ordinary Good Samaritans who are attempting to assist those with the potential of drug overdose and its subsequent consequences.  Background  In late 2019, several issues were facing the treatment of substance abuse disorders in Colorado. The increasing persistence of fentanyl found in other addictive drugs like heroin or opioids and ensuing overdose. E.g, overdoses related to fentanyl tripled in Denver 2017-2019. There was growing concern, mostly from local health departments, about the efficacy of needle-exchange programs. Although a “Good Samaritan” law was extant protecting individuals who administered the nasal spray naloxone Narcan or the injection Evzio and research had indicated that both drugs remained chemically stable after their expiration dates, even when kept in less-than- ideal conditions, there was no legal protection for individuals who might dispense expired naloxone products to someone suffering from a drug overdose.  Legislation  On January 8, 2020, legislation was introduced in the Colorado House of Representatives by Rep. Chris Kennedy (D-District 23) and Rep. Leslie Herod (D-District 8). The bill was sent to the House Health and Insurance Committee. After three readings, the House passed the bill, Harm Reduction Substance Use Disorders Bill HB 20-1065; it was then taken up by the Colorado Senate on June 9, 2020, where it was sponsored by Sen. Brittany Pettersen (D-District 22) and Sen. Kevin Priola (R-District 25) and assigned to the State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. After amendment, it was passed by the committee and referred to the Senate as a whole, where it was passed on June 11. HB 20-1065 was forwarded to Gov. Jared Polis (D) and signed into law on July 13, 2020. The bill requires that the cost of opioid antagonists such as Narcan and Evzio be covered by health insurance. It provided liability protection to people using an expired opioid antagonist in “good faith.” Pharmacists are allowed to provide clean syringes to individuals requesting them; the pharmacists are also protected from prosecution under drug paraphernalia laws. They must also inform individuals filling opioid pain-killer prescriptions on the availability of opioid antagonists. Non- profit organizations are permitted to conduct clean-needle programs without local board of health approval but with a reporting requirement.  Opposition  The most significant opposition to the bill came from local boards of health who were concerned that the law would remove the boards from control of needle-exchange programs. The non-profit running such programs are required to garner approval from boards of health before opening. The boards of health were also perturbed that syringe programs might lead to higher crime locales around them, even though CDC research has said there are stable crime rates in areas where needle-exchange programs operate.

Cast *Tab Hunter....Paul Morgan *Richard Erdman....Peter Fairfield III *Jerome Cowan...John Larsen *Reta Shaw....Thelma Synopsis Tab Hunter in a promotional photograph for The Tab Hunter Show. Paul Morgan is 29-year-old cartoonist who draws the daily comic strip Bachelor at Large. The strip is essentially his diary, based on his own life as a carefree bachelor in Malibu, California, which is filled with romantic adventures — and misadventures — both in Malibu and during his trips to Europe. Paul perpetually is surrounded by beautiful young women and spends a lot of time trying to gain the favor of a woman he meets or getting out of a relationship that seems to be turning serious. There often are complications, and he often gets in over his head while trying to impress a woman. His best friend Peter Fairfield III is a rich-but-stingy playboy who loves beautiful women, fashion, and fast cars and often is mixed up in Paul's romantic romps. Paul's housekeeper, Thelma, disapproves of the steady stream of women passing through Paul's life and frequently tells him so. Paul works for Comics, Inc., where his boss is John Larsen. Paul often exasperates Larsen, who is dumbfounded by Paul's antics and frequently has difficulty keeping Paul on task and on deadline in drawing his comic strip. Bachelor at Large is wildly popular and a big moneymaker for the company, however, so as long as Paul turns his strips in on time, Larsen forgives his transgressions. Production For the 1960–1961 television season, NBC hoped to counter criticism that network television aired too many violent action-adventure shows by creating a four- hour Sunday-evening lineup completely devoted to family-friendly programming. A particularly important component of the new lineup involved replacing the live comedy and variety shows that previously had dominated the 8:00–9:00 p.m. slot on Sunday evenings on NBC with filmed situation comedies. National Velvet at 8:00 p.m. and The Tab Hunter Show at 8:30 p.m. were the situation comedies NBC chose to fill the hour beginning in September 1960. Stanley Shapiro created and produced The Tab Hunter Show, which gave 1950s movie heartthrob Tab Hunter his own television show in the hope of attracting young women and girls to NBC on Sunday evenings, and each week the show featured a beautiful young woman as a guest star in the hope of attracting young men and boys as viewers as well. When NBC announced the show in March 1960, it referred to it with the title Bachelor at Large, but by mid-April 1960 it had received the name The Tab Hunter Show. When The Tab Hunter Show premiered in September 1960, Hunter was at the peak of his career, having received acclaim for his performance in the 1958 theatrical film Damn Yankees, and he explained that he wanted to switch to a television series — considered a noteworthy development in the entertainment world at the time — because he felt that it was a medium that would allow him greater freedom to act. It was his first comedic role. Zeke Zekley, best known for his work on George McManus′s comic strip Bringing Up Father, drew the strips for The Tab Hunter Show. Pete Rugolo composed the show's theme music. In July 1960, Hunter was arrested for beating his dog, a charge that later was dropped when it turned out that Hunter's neighbor had fabricated the story out of spite. The arrest nonetheless marred the show's September 1960 premiere. Critical reception When The Tab Hunter Show premiered in September 1960, critics generally gave it mediocre reviews. Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press and John Crosby of the Hartford Courant both noted that the show's premise was very close to that of The Bob Cummings Show of 1955–1959, Lowry finding the similarity \\"embarassingly reminiscent\\" of the earlier show while Crosby assessed that the women featured on The Tab Hunter Show were \\"more stunning\\" than those on The Bob Cummings Show, but that Tab Hunter lacked Bob Cummings's talent for comedy. Percy Shain of The Boston Globe noted that show plots would be repetitive and predicted that young people would like the show more than older viewers. Jack Gould of The New York Times found the show's plots far-fetched, but thought younger teenagers might enjoy it. In early November 1960, with The Tab Hunter Show having been on the air for almost two months, critic Steven H. Scheuer wrote that the show had “started off pleasantly enough but has deteriorated into a series of clichés about the bachelor with the roving eye.” Broadcast history The Tab Hunter Show premiered on September 18, 1960, and aired on Sundays at 8:30 p.m. throughout its run. Unable to compete in its time slot with the very popular The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tab Hunter Show drew poor ratings; after its last new episode aired on April 30, 1961, NBC announced its cancellation in May 1961 after a single season. Prime-time reruns of the show continued until September 10, 1961. The Tab Hunter Show had greater success in the United Kingdom, where the BBC broadcast 24 episodes of it from January 5 to September 26, 1961, at first on Thursdays at 7:30 p.m. and then on Tuesdays at 8:00 p.m. Episodes Sources { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } References External links *The Tab Hunter Show opening credits on YouTube *Remembering some of the cast from The Tab Hunter Show on YouTube *The Tab Hunter Show episode \\"Portia Go Home\\" (1960) on YouTube *The Tab Hunter Show episode \\"Portia Go Home\\" with J.

Shunesburg Mountain is set to the southeast, directly across the mouth of Parunuweap Canyon. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. It is named for Nephi Johnson (1833–1919), a Mormon missionary, interpreter, explorer, and the first white man to visit Zion Canyon. In 1858 a Paiute guide by the name of Nauguts led Nephi into the Zion Canyon area of the upper Virgin River.Kiver, Eugene P.; Harris, David V. (1999). Geology of U.S. Parklands (5th ed.) p. 457, New York City: John Wiley & Sons. . Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, where he founded the town of Virgin. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Johnson Mountain. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 °F (0 °C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

Trotter, Jr. (born February 25, 1934) served for 5 years as the Presiding Justice of the California Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Third Division. After 1987, he was a major contributor to the advancement of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as one of the founding members of JAMS. Biography John K. Trotter, Jr., a native of New York City, New York, was born in 1934. While in high school, he moved with his family to San Diego County. On a basketball scholarship, he attended Loyola College, but he entered the U.S. Army to serve in the Korean War. He then attended Santa Monica College, and as a returning veteran with high grades, he achieved early admittance to University of Southern California Law School. He completed his law degree in 1961. John Trotter while in private practice specialized in civil litigation, and as a trial lawyer tried in excess of 100 jury trials in State and Federal Court. Trotter was president of the Orange County Bar Association for 1978–1979. Trotter in 1979 became a Superior Court Judge in Orange County. Trotter during the early 1980s helped form Amicus Publico, which later became the Public Law Center for Orange County. Governor Jerry Brown in April 1982 appointed Trotter to Division Two of the 4th District of the California Court of Appeal. In November 1982, Trotter was appointed as the Presiding Justice of the newly created Division Three of the 4th District, starting out with a 300 case backlog. The court became further backlogged with many new appeals, which Trotter credited to the high number of complex civil cases. Trotter set up a process so that the justices could type their opinions directly into a computer to avoid writing the opinions by hand. By 1985, the justices were writing an average of 140 opinions per year, more than elsewhere in California. John Trotter in 1987 took early retirement from the California Court of Appeal to join JAMS, an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) organization. While with JAMS, he became one of the leading experts in ADR, with extensive knowledge of ADR hearing formats and procedures. He has successfully resolved thousands of cases involving a variety of types of cases, including mass torts, class actions, and personal injury. Trotter has served as Special Master in several multi-district litigation pharmaceutical matters, in the Toyota Sudden Acceleration case, and other complex cases in both Federal and State court, supervising the claims and payment to thousands of plaintiffs in each litigation. Trotter has received many honors and recognitions over his career, to name just a few: * \\"Orange County ADR Lawyer of the Year\\", by Best Lawyers * \\"Lifetime Achievement Award for his distinguished career as an attorney, judge, and major contributor to the advancement of ADR\\", by the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association * \\"Franklin G. West\\" Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, by the Orange County Bar Association * Recognized as a \\"Best Lawyer, ADR Category\\", by Best Lawyers in America California state judicial service In 1979, Trotter was appointed to the position of Superior Court Judge in Orange County. In April 1982, Trotter was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to the position of Associate Justice, California Court of Appeal, 4th District, Division 2, in San Bernardino. In November 1982, Trotter was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to the position of Presiding Justice, California Court of Appeal, 4th District, for the newly created Division 3, in Orange County. In 1983, Trotter was appointed to the temporary position of Associate Justice Pro Tem, Supreme Court of California. In 1987, Trotter took early retirement from his position at the California Court of Appeal. Notable court decision In the case Register Div. of Freedom Newspapers, Inc. v. County of Orange (1984) (158 Cal.App.3d 893.), a newspaper wanted to discover notes and reports by Orange County's claims settlement committee. In this case of a police misconduct lawsuit brought by a jail inmate, Trotter concluded that “the public interest in finding out how decisions to spend public funds are formulated and insuring governmental processes remain open and subject to public scrutiny” outweighs any interest that Orange County might have in keeping secret its settlement policy and decisions. This opinion required public entities to publicly disclose previously secret settlement agreements with tort litigants. Other notable cases John Trotter designed the process and supervised the resolution of the wildfire victim claims resulting from the Witch Creek Fire and the Rice Canyon Fire caused by San Diego Gas & Electric power lines in 2007. In 2010, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna assigned the JAMS neutrals Justice John K. Trotter (Ret.) and Justice Steven J. Stone (Ret.) to be the Special Masters in the Toyota unintended acceleration multi-district litigation. In 2020, John Trotter was assigned as the Trustee of the Fire Victim Trust as part of the reorganization plan of the 2019 bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric Company resulting from the Camp Fire, Tubbs Fire, Butte Fire, and also a series of wildfires beginning on October 8, 2017, collectively called the 2017 North Bay Fires.

Pecazine was first synthesized in 1953 by Wilhelm Schuler and Otto Nieschulz and was quickly incorporated into psychiatric practice as an ataractic, i.e., a true tranquilizer rather than a hypnotic or depressant. It was considered interchangeable with chlorpromazine, albeit with a different side effect profile, which included less sedation and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms due to its potent parasympatholytic and anticholinergic effect. As early as 1958, however, studies reported inferiority to other phenothiazines in the treatment of schizophrenia and questioned its place in the clinic; in 1960, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial found pecazine to be no more effective than placebo. Subsequent research found that, like the structurally related promethazine, pecazine is essentially devoid of antipsychotic activity. Pecazine was implicated in a number of cases of agranulocytosis and was subsequently withdrawn from the market. More recently, it has become a subject of research interest as a MALT1 and RANKL inhibitor.

As of 2000 there was no official management plan, but some protection was provided by restrictive hunting seasons and exploitation in some zones being limited to clan residents. The river serves as a refuge for hippopotamus to escape threats they face on the Ubangi. There are many endemic and migratory fish species.

Summary The book looks at fungi from a number of angles, including decomposition, fermentation, nutrient distribution, psilocybin production, the evolutionary role fungi plays in plants, and the ways in which humans relate to the fungal kingdom. It uses music and philosophy to illustrate its thesis, and introduces readers to a number of central strands of research on mycology. It is also a personal account of Sheldrake's experiences with fungi. Sheldrake is an expert in mycorrhizal fungi, holds a PhD in tropical ecology from the University of Cambridge, and his research is primarily in the fields of fungal biology and the history of Amazonian ethnobotany. He is the son of Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist, and Jill Purce, an author and therapist, and the brother of musician Cosmo Sheldrake. Reception Jennifer Szalai of the New York Times called the book an \\"ebullient and ambitious exploration\\" of fungi, adding, \\"reading it left me not just moved but altered, eager to disseminate its message of what fungi can do.\\" Eugenia Bone of the Wall Street Journal called it \\"a gorgeous book of literary nature writing in the tradition of [Robert] Macfarlane and John Fowles, ripe with insight and erudition.\\" Rachel Cooke of The Observer called it \\"an astonishing book that could alter our perceptions of fungi forever.\\" Richard Kerridge, reviewing the book in The Guardian, wrote that \\"when we look closely [at fungi], we meet large, unsettling questions... [Sheldrake] carries us easily into these questions with ebullience and precision.\\" After completing Entangled Life, Sheldrake dampened a copy of the book, seeded it with spores, and ate the oyster mushrooms that grew from its pages. With another copy, he mashed up some of the pages to release their sugars, and fermented it into beer.

Riojas died later that year in November after a four year battle with pancreatic cancer.  Biography  = Early life and education = Diana Laura Riojas was born on 9 March 1958 in Nueva Rosita, Coahuila, Mexico.Montiel, Elsie. \\"Diana Laura Riojas\\". Revistas Cisan. March 1995. Retrieved 2 September 2020. At the age of 12, Riojas's father, Rodrigo, died from a heart attack, leaving behind his wife, Hilda Elisa Reyes, to raise her children as a widow. Eight years later, when Riojas was twenty, her sister became a widow as well. Riojas was educated in Monterrey before she moved to Mexico City to study economics at Anahuac University. One of her teachers at the university, Luis Donaldo Colosio, would later be her husband. Riojas earned degrees in international trade and political analysis. = Marriage and cancer diagnosis = Riojas took several jobs in both the public and private sectors before she received a position in the Secretariat of Planning and the Budget, where she met Colosio again. Riojas and Colosio married in 1984, and the couple had two children, Luis Donaldo and Mariana. In mid-1990, at the age of 32, Riojas was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She had two bouts of serious illness: first in 1990 when she received her diagnosis and then in late 1993 when her husband was seeking the PRI's nomination for presidential candidate. Riojas made a full recovery on both occasions. = Widowhood = On 23 March 1994, two weeks after Riojas's 36th birthday, her husband Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated during a rally in Tijuana, Baja California, for his presidential campaign. Two days after Colosio was assassinated, Riojas delivered a eulogy, which was broadcast on Mexican national television, in front of 10,000 people. After being widowed, Riojas founded the Luis Donaldo Colosio Foundation in addition to a scholarship in the name of her late husband. Riojas began investigating Colosio's assassination, though she stated in June of 1994 that it was unlikely that the truth would be discovered soon. Riojas's cancer started worsening after her husband's assassination. In July of 1994, Riojas traveled to Europe, and she visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo along with her son, Luis Donaldo. On 22 July 1994, Riojas was received by King Juan Carlos I of Spain and his wife Sophia at the Palace of Zarzuela. During the Mexican general election on 21 August, in which Riojas's late husband was set to participate at the time of his death, Riojas herself received write-in votes. = Decline and death = Riojas's pancreatic cancer started deteriorating quickly in late September of 1994. She was hospitalized on 14 October 1994, and she died on 18 November 1994. The doctor who treated Riojas, Misael Uribe, stated that Riojas's malign pancreatic tumour, detected in March of 1990, created metastases in the liver and the retroperitoneal nodes, leading to advanced malnutritition and liver failure, thus contributing directly to her death. Her remains, along with those of her husband, lie together in Colosio's hometown of Magdalena de Kino, Sonora.

It is administratively divided between the Municipalities of Rome (Maccarese Nord) and Fiumicino, of which it is a frazione. It was entirely part of the Municipality of Rome until 1993, when the former Circoscrizione XIV, which included a part of the hamlet, became the autonomous Municipality of Fiumicino. Crossed by the Arrone river, which flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea, the locality - which extends from the Fiumicino Airport to the sea and borders Fregene to the north-west - is best known for the homonymous farm Maccarese S.p.A., established in 1925 following the reclamation works of this area of the Ager Romanus.  History  The first evidence of a permanent settlement dates back to the Copper Age (3400-2200 BC). In this period a village of huts was established in the area that is currently called Cerquete- Fianello, located in the southern part of the territory of Maccarese (Manfredini et alii, 2002). Before the reclamation, the territory was rather marshy, with two little lakes (now dried up), one located in the farthest area from the city center and the other near the castle called Villa San Giorgio. A property of the Roman family of the Normanni in the 13th century, around 1300 there was built the castle of Villa San Giorgio, which hosted the Alessandrini, the Anguillara and later the Mattei; the latter, during the 16th century, unified Vaccarese with the estates of Cortecchia and Castello San Giorgio, thus reaching the total extension of about 1,700 rubbi (equal to over 3,000 hectares),Nicola Maria Nicolai, Pietro Ruga, Andrea Alippi, Memorie, leggi, ed osservazioni sulle campagne e sull'annona di Roma..., Rome 1803, p. 97. together with other families of the Roman nobility and religious bodies. In 1569 the restoration of the castle took place, while in 1574 Torre Primavera was built. In the 17th century it passed from the Mattei into the hands of the Rospigliosi, who were the last owners of the estate before its complete reclamation. In 1925 the great reclamation began, promoted by a company made up by financial investors who, aroused by the fees made available by the State, tried to reclaim the area with the aim of making the land fertile, dividing the estate into farms and then sell them. But the project could not go through because, thanks to the substantial increase in the availability of new farmlands due to the reclamation itself, the prices of landed properties and agricultural products had in the meantime collapsed so that, at the beginning of the 1930s, the land no longer had the characteristic of a safe haven. Investors thus found themselves managing a company which, given its large size, had too high operating costs and therefore were forced to rely on a public holding company, IRI. In the meantime, numerous settlers arrived from the Province of Mantua and above all from Veneto to cultivate fields, plant vineyards and guard the numerous dairy cattle. Over the years Maccarese became the showcase of Italian agriculture and was visited by the most important Italian and foreign delegations. In the 1950s there were great economic problems, as the workforce was redundant due to controversial management choices, which led to a long crisis that lasted until 1998, when the company - comprising more than of agricultural land as well as the castle and other important buildings - was privatised and purchased by Edizione Holding of the Benetton brothers for 94 billion lire.  IPGRI - Maccarese mill  In 1997 the European Union recognized the Maccarese area as suitable for the construction of a science and technology park, which would take advantage of both good infrastructural connections and the proximity of universities to create an environment favorable to the development of scientific innovation, especially in the agricultural sector (location on Google Maps). The possibility of creating the park was given to the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), the most important world reference for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. Since July 2001, the official headquarters of IPGRI have been located in Maccarese, in an area of great agricultural tradition, inside a former mill that has been completely renovated. The President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was present at the inauguration of the new headquarters. The building is a former mill designed to store cereals and to process agricultural products before distribution.  Nature reserve  Vasche del Maccarese WWF oasis. Vasche del Maccarese is a natural oasis managed by WWF Italia, part of the Litorale Romano State Nature Reserve. In summertime it becomes one of the favorite destinations of the inhabitants of the district (especially young people), due to its proximity to the Fregene / Maccarese coast, where bathing facilities have sprung up since the late 1970s (the official beach of the Polizia di Stato is also located there); furthermore, several personalities of entertainment and journalism reside there (an example is the house of Alberto Moravia near the coast).  Infrastructures and transport  The Maccarese-Fregene railway station is located along the Tyrrhenian Railway; Maccarese is also served by some bus lines of the Municipality of Fiumicino. It can be reached via the Autostrada A12 (Fregene- Maccarese exit), which connects it to Rome, about away.  Sport  = Football = * Giada Maccarese C.L., a junior football team * A.S.D.

Unyo Maru No. 2 was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District as an auxiliary transport ship on 26 November 1941, but it almost immediately sailed for Indochina to take part in the invasion of Borneo. On 13 December 1941, the invasion force departed from Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina to attack Sarawak. The naval forces, commanded by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō, escorted the army group under General Hisaichi Terauchi. Unyo Maru No. 2, carrying equipment and supplies for the naval force, arrived at Lutong on 15 December and stayed there for the remainder of the invasion, which succeeded without much resistance from the British defenders. On 22 December, the main body of the Japanese naval force, including Unyo Maru No. 2, disembarked Japanese troops at Miri and sailed for Kuching to commence the second phase of the invasion of Borneo. The convoy arrived off Kuching two days later and supported the attack on the town, all the while being harassed by Dutch bombers and submarines. During one such attack, a bombing raid by three Dutch Air Force Martin B-10 bombers on 26 December, Unyo Maru No. 2 was set on fire by bombs and sunk, killing eight crewmen.

His works comprise mostly sculptured church furniture, and to a lesser extent individual sculptures, both portrait busts as well as statues of saints for churches. Life Willemsens was born in Antwerp where he was baptised in the Cathedral on 7 October 1630. His parents were Michiel Willemsens and Lucia Keersmaeckers.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius (eds.), De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, Antwerp, 1864, pp. 313, 325, 420, 522 and 614 He had a brother called Anton or Anthonis who trained as a painter and was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1649-1650.Anthonis Willemsen at The Netherlands Institute for Art History Bust of the Apostle Judas Thaddeus It is generally believed that he was a pupil of Artus Quellinus the Elder although there is no documentary evidence proving such apprenticeship. The reason why there is no record of his apprenticeship may have to do with the fact that, as a court sculptor, Quellinus was not required to be a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke and so did not have to register his pupils with the Guild.Wilhelm Tack, Die Barockisierung des Paderborner Domes in: Westfälische Zeitschrift, 97/II, 1947, p. 35-79 Quellinus was the leading Flemish sculptor whose Baroque style had a major influence on the development of sculpture in Northern Europe. Quellinus worked for a long time in Amsterdam where he supervised the sculptural decorations program for the new city hall.Hans Vlieghe and Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Quellinus.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Oct. 2020 Lodewijk is thought to have helped Quellinus in Amsterdam as a journeyman in his service and this is likely the reason why he delayed his admission as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. Quellinus may have assisted him also in obtaining commissions including those for several altars for the Paderborn Cathedral which he completed in the period from 1655 to 1661. Willemsens was first recorded in Paderborn on 26 February 1655, as working in the service of Dietrich Adolph, the Prince Bishop of Paderborn. His brother Anton worked alongside him on the decorations of Paderborn Cathedral for which Anton painted six altarpieces. Lodewijk made the high altar in the Paderborn Cathedral in a grand Baroque style reminiscent of the high altar in the Antwerp Jesuit church, which had been designed by Rubens and executed by Johannes van Mildert. The defining feature of the Paderborn high altar were the four winding columns that framed the altar. He is believed to have stayed in Paderborn until 1661, the year in which he became a master in the Antwerp guild. Through their work in Paderborn, the Willemsens brother gave an important impetus to the spread of Baroque art in Northern Germany. Large terracotta model of a putto He married Anna Corvers in Antwerp's Saint George ' s Church on 27 April 1671. His wife died on 8 January 1691. He received Jacobus van der Biest as his pupil in the guild year 1672-1673, Guiliam Schobbens in the guild year 1687-1688 and Pierre-Denis Plumier in the guild year 1698-1699. The Paderborner sculptor Johann Mauritz Gröninger may also have trained with him. He died in Antwerp where he was buried on 12 October 1702 in the Saint George ' s Church next to his wife. A Joanna Maria Willemsens was buried with them in 1709. She may have been a daughter or close relative Work He created mainly sculptured church furniture, and to a lesser extent individual sculptures, both portrait busts as well as statues of saints for churches. His altars can be found in Antwerp, Paderborn, and Tournai. He worked in many materials including wood, marble and terracotta. Confessional, St Andrew's Church Antwerp His style is characterized by a sensual expressiveness which is close to Van Dyck's emotionally charged treatment of religious subjects. This is evidenced in the symbolic personifications of Catholic doctrine decorating the pulpit of the Church of St James in Antwerp, and in the figures of saints in the choir stalls of the former Cistercian Abbey of St. Bernard in Hemiksem. He was known in his time for his ability to sculpt small children, in particular in marble. His skill in this regard was described as being equal to that of the Flemish sculptor François Duquesnoy who was famous for his children's figures. Willemsens collaborated with several major sculptors in Antwerp. He was initially a frequent collaborator of his presumed master Artus Quellinus the Elder, contributing in particular to the Amsterdam new City Hall decorations. In the second half of the 17th century a few large sculpture workshops in Antwerp came to dominate the market. They were the workshops of the families Quellinus, van den Eynde, Kerricx, Scheemaeckers and Verbrugghen with whom Willemsens also formed an informal partnership. The close links between these Antwerp workshops resulted in a very similar style of late Baroque sculpture, which has made it often difficult to identify which artist or workshop produced a particular work. Willemsens collaborated between 1683 and 1688 with Norbert van den Eynde on an altarpiece dedicated to St Catherine for the oudekleerkopers guild in the cathedral of Antwerp. In 1690, he collaborated with Pieter Verbrugghen the Younger on two statues for the 1678 altarpiece of the Venerabelkapel in the St. James' Church in Antwerp. His best known work is probably the bust of Juan Domingo de Zuñiga y Fonseca the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands (exhibited at the Museum aan de Stroom in Antwerp but part of the collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). This bust was commissioned by the Guild of Saint Luke as a gift to the governor for his support in an eighteen-year long litigation between the Guild and the local guild of crossbowmen.

The sixteenth tropical cyclone, fourteenth named storm, and the fifth hurricane of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Nana originated from a tropical wave near the Lesser Antilles. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began tracking the wave on August 27, giving it a low chance of formation. Contrary to predictions, the wave rapidly organized, though data failed to locate a closed circulation, and the system was not designated a tropical cyclone. However, the system continued organizing, and data from a hurricane hunter aircraft recorded tropical storm force winds along with a closed circulation; the NHC subsequently named the system Tropical Storm Nana on September 1\\\\. Nana rapidly intensified that day, though wind shear increased early the next day, preventing the storm from intensifying further. However, early on September 3, reconnaissance aircraft found that Nana had strengthened into a hurricane just before making landfall in Southern Belize. After landfall, it began to rapidly weaken. Early on September 4, its low-level center dissipated and it degenerated into a mid-level remnant low. The remnants moved into the Eastern Pacific, where they reformed into Tropical Storm Julio. Numerous watches and warnings were issued ahead of Nana for parts of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. The storm brought high winds and moderate rainfall to parts of Honduras. Nana is the first hurricane to make landfall in Belize since Earl in 2016. Meteorological history On August 23, 2020, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified a westward moving tropical wave over West Africa. A broad area of disorganized convection, primarily east of the wave axis, accompanied the system as it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early the next day. Convection increased by August 27 as the system traversed the central Atlantic, and the NHC noted the possibility of gradual cyclogenesis over the following days. Little development occurred over the next few days as it approached the Windward Islands. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on August 30, the system started to organize with evidence of a broad surface low apparent on satellite-derived observations. Convection gradually increased as the system continued west across the Caribbean and appeared well-organized on satellite imagery. Scatterometer data and ship observations revealed tropical storm-force winds south of Haiti and southeast of Jamaica early on September 1, though the system still lacked a closed low. With the system posing an imminent threat to Central America, the NHC initated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen at 15:00 UTC. The estimated center was situated about 140 mi (225 km) south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. With a defined anticyclone aloft providing ample outflow, high sea surface temperatures, and low to moderate wind shear, steady organization was expected. Shortly thereafter, aircraft reconnaissance confirmed a well-defined surface low with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) aloft with surface winds estimated at 50 mph (85 km/h) at this time. Accordingly, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Nana, marking the earliest formation of a season's fourteenth named storm, surpassing the previous record set by Hurricane Nate on September 6, 2005. Infrared imagery of Nana at peak intensity, making landfall in Belize The storm steadily strengthened, obtaining 1-minute sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) at 03:00 UTC on September 2. Afterwards, moderate northerly shear of 15 knots halted the intensification trend and partially exposed the center of circulation. The central pressure of Nana fluctuated between 996 and 1000 mbars (29.41 and 29.53 inHg) throughout the day on September 2, while sustained winds remained steady at 60 mph. Early the next day, a slight center reformation and a burst of convection allowed Nana to quickly intensify into a minimal hurricane at 03:00 UTC on September 3\\\\. Simultaneously, it reached its peak intensity of 75 mph (120 km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 994 mbar (29.36 inHg). Three hours later, Nana made landfall between Dangriga and Placencia in Belize with a similar intensity, although its pressure had risen a mbar. Nana rapidly weakened after landfall, dropping below hurricane status at 09:00 UTC due to interaction with the mountainous terrain over Belize and Guatemala. It further weakened to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC before its low-level center dissipated, causing the NHC to issue their final advisory on the storm at 03:00 UTC on September 4. The remnants of Nana then entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec, where they later redeveloped into Tropical Storm Julio in the Eastern Pacific on September 5. Preparations and impact The wind swath of Hurricane Nana with hurricane-force winds in red and tropical storm-force winds in orange. Multiple tropical storm watches and tropical storm warnings were issued ahead of Nana for parts of Belize and Honduras, with the former upgrading their warnings to hurricane warnings. After Nana had weakened below hurricane intensify following landfall at 09:00 UTC on September 3; as such, all hurricane warnings were cancelled. Additional warnings were all cancelled by 15:00 UTC, as Nana moved farther inland and continued to rapidly weaken. =Windward Islands= Nana shortly after formation on September 1\\\\. Between August 29–30, the Barbados Met Office and Dominica Meteorological Service issued flash flood watches for their respective nations in anticipation of moderate to heavy rains from the precursor wave. Météo-France alerted residents in Martinique of possible heavy rain and strong winds from the tropical wave on August 30–31. The associated showers and thunderstorms produced up to of rain in Grand'Rivière and wind gusts to in Fonds-Saint- Denis. Approximately 5,600 customers lost power in Le François, Vert-Pré, La Trinité, Tartane, and L'Ajoupa-Bouillon. EDF deployed power crews soon after the storm's passage. Southern areas of Guadeloupe saw heavy rainfall; Goyave recorded a 12-hour accumulation of . Nearby Îles des Saintes recorded . In St. Lucia, increased turbidity and clogging due to heavy rain forced the temporary closure of the Theobalds Treatment Plant which cut the water supply to residents in northern parts of the country. =Belize= In preparation for Nana, residents of Belize packed hardware and grocery stores, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. More than 4,000 people in the southern part of the country were evacuated to shelters provided by the government. A station on Carrie Bow Cay reported a wind speed of 61 mph (98 km/h) as the storm came ashore. Preliminary reports from southern Belize indicated that hundreds of acres of banana and plantain farm crops were lost to the storm. A week after the storm, it was reported that 960 acres of banana crops were entirely destroyed. Damage assessment teams reported 7 damaged structures in Hopkins, 13 in Silk Grass and 4 homes in Dangriga with roof damage. Overall, Nana caused an estimated US$20 million in damage to banana crops in Belize. =Elsewhere= In Jamaica Nana's rainfall caused some flooding in parts of Southern Jamaica. In Cayman Islands Nana's rainfall caused some minor flooding in some low lying areas on Grand Cayman. In Honduras, Nana's rainfall caused flash flooding in Coxen Hole. Guatemala reported heavy rains, especially along its border with Mexico. The country's national disaster coordinator reported no deaths. No one had been evacuated due to the storm in Guatemala. In Mexico, the primary impact from Nana was heavy rainfall. A swath of up to was reported along Nana's path in Eastern Mexico.

Formed in March 1943, it was initially designated the Palembang Air Defense Headquarters. History The Palembang Air Defense Headquarters was established in March 1943 and initially comprised the 101st, 102nd and 103rd Air Defense Regiments and the 101st Machine Cannon Battalion. Each of the air defense regiments was equipped with 20 Type 88 75 mm AA guns. They may have also each included a machine cannon battery and a searchlight battery. In January 1944 the 9th Air Division was established as part of efforts to strengthen Sumatra's air defenses. By this time the Palembang Air Defense Headquarters had been re-designated the Palembang Defense Unit, and was assigned to the 9th Air Division upon that command's formation. This unit was expanded to include both fighter aircraft and antiaircraft gun units. The 21st and 22nd Fighter Regiments of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force were responsible for intercepting Allied aircraft. The 101st, 102nd and 103rd Antiaircraft Regiments and 101st Machine Cannon Battalion remained, and had been supplemented by the 101st Antiaircraft Balloon Regiment which operated barrage balloons. The Palembang Defense Unit failed to damage any of the American B-29 Superfortress bombers which attacked the city during the Operation Boomerang raid on the night of 10/11 August 1944. It also saw combat during the British Operation Meridian carrier air attacks on Palembang during January 1945.

Prude had been suffering from a mental health episode after ingesting PCP and was walking naked in the city's streets. The officers put a spit hood over his head after he began spitting. They held him face down on the pavement for two minutes and fifteen seconds, and he stopped breathing. Prude received CPR on the scene and later died of complications from asphyxia after being taken off life support. The autopsy report ruled Prude's death a homicide and also included the contributing factors to his death as \\"excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP\\". The killing first received attention in September 2020 when the police body camera video and written reports were released along with the autopsy report. Following the report's release, protesters demonstrated outside the Rochester police headquarters and many considered the death to be related to Prude's race. The demonstrations were connected to the Black Lives Matter movement and the string of racial unrest events of 2020.  Arrest and death  Daniel T. Prude arrived in Rochester, New York, from Chicago on March 22, 2020, to visit his older brother, Joe Prude. Daniel acted erratically upon his arrival, jumping headfirst down a flight of stairs. His brother dialed emergency services for help. Daniel received a mental health evaluation at Strong Memorial Hospital and was released that night. Within several hours, Daniel resumed his erratic behavior and fled his brother's house around 3 a.m. His brother called emergency services again for assistance. Prude shed his long underwear, tank top, and socks while on the street. A passerby recorded a Facebook Live video of Prude after he begged someone to call emergency services, but Prude ran away when the person called. At 3:16 a.m., multiple officers, and two emergency medical technicians, arrived at Prude's location in southwest Rochester, where he was walking naked and bleeding. One officer exited his car and approached Prude, pointing a taser at him while asking him six times to get on the ground. Prude complied, and was then asked by the officer to put his hands behind his back, to which he also complied. During the arrest, he said, \\"Yes, sir\\" several times to the officer. While handcuffed and on the ground, Prude repeatedly said, \\"In Jesus Christ I pray, amen\\", among various other comments. At around 3:19 a.m., Prude became agitated, spitting at officers, and yelling, \\"Give me that gun\\", until one officer placed a spit hood over Prude's head. Prude demanded that they remove it. One minute later, Prude unsuccessfully attempted to stand up before being repeatedly pushed over by officers, who forcibly held him down for approximately two minutes and 15 seconds. Officer Mark Vaughn used his body weight and both hands to press the side of Prude's head to the pavement. Vaughn's report called this a \\"hypoglossal nerve technique\\" which, according to USA Today, \\"involves jamming fingers into a nerve below the jaw to cause pain and persuade a subject to comply\\". Officer Troy Talladay applied his knee to Prude's back. Another officer held Prude's legs. At the start of the hold, Prude said, \\"You're trying to kill me.\\" The officers noticed liquid coming from Prude's mouth as he stopped speaking and moving. As Vaughn released his hold, he said \\"You good now?\\" Prude did not respond. Vaughn then pushed on his head with one hand for 45 seconds while the attending officers chatted. Three minutes and ten seconds after the restraint began, one police officer remarked that he had been vomiting during the restraint and his chest compressions appeared to have stopped. The Associated Press reported that police leaders pressed Rochester to keep the video of Prude's death secret, fearing a \\"violent blowback\\" if the video came out during the nationwide George Floyd protests. An emergency medical technician asked the officers to turn Prude on his back. Acknowledging that Prude was unresponsive, he instructed an officer to apply CPR, which he did. At 3:27 a.m., Prude was placed into an ambulance. While in transport to Strong Memorial Hospital, his heartbeat resumed, but he remained incapacitated from lack of oxygen and was later declared brain dead. He was taken off life support a week after the arrest, on March 30.  Investigations and aftermath  The medical examiner's autopsy report ruled Prude's death a homicide as a result of \\"complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint\\". The report found contributing factors included \\"excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP\\". The report did not mention prior mental health issues or explain the link between the toxicology test and his behavior. Prude's sister claimed Prude smoked a PCP-laced joint at a party prior to his erratic behavior. She sent him to visit their brother when he began acting erratically. Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, said Prude's death is being investigated. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on September 2, 2020, that he had originally asked James to investigate the case in July, and that it had been under investigation \\"for months\\" prior to September. Rochester paused its investigation when the state took up the case in April, as the Attorney General's office investigates deaths of unarmed people in police custody rather than having them handled locally. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren said that the city could not be involved in the case until the state investigation finished. On August 20, the family's lawyer, Elliot Dolby- Shields, received 88 minutes of body camera recordings following an open records request. The video contains one brief gap but, according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, appears to show the 11-minute incident in full. The newspaper said that the video showed no physical resistance from Prude and no overtly hostile actions from the officers. Shields said that the family \\"will sue everyone who is responsible for Daniel Prude's death\\" during a news conference on September 2.  Reactions  Prude's death originally gained notoriety following a press conference on September 2, 2020, which highlighted the body camera video evidence of his death. During the conference, Joe Prude, Daniel's brother, denounced his killing as a \\"coldblooded murder\\", asking, \\"How many more brothers got to die for society to understand that this needs to stop?\\" During a later press conference, Rochester's chief of police claimed that the delay in releasing video evidence \\"was not a cover-up\\" and that he understood the frustration towards Prude's death. The Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, called it a \\"tragedy\\". The Mayor of Rochester, Lovely Warren, said during the same conference that she was \\"very disturbed\\" by the footage of his death, but added, \\"This is not something that's...in our control at this moment in time.\\" The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, similarly called the video \\"very disturbing\\". The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle likened the killing's circumstances to that of George Floyd's, whose death two months after Prude's led to national protests.  Subsequent protests  Protests have occurred each day since the announcement about Daniel Prude's death. Rochester Police, with assistance from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office and New York State Police have been the main agencies present at each protest since September 3. = First week = On September 2, 2020, in response to the video footage release and subsequent press conference, protesters demonstrated outside the City Public Safety Building (PSB), the department headquarters. Several protesters were arrested and released with appearance summons for entering the headquarters, several attempting to attend a press conference held by the Mayor. Rochester police made another round of arrests during protests the following day that, at times, turned violent. Protesters gathered and chanted near the Public Safety Building, and tensions began rising around 10:30 p.m. with police deploying pepper spray and pepper balls multiple times in a 10-minute span. Some protesters threw rocks and bottles, with some removing and pushing back a protective fence set up outside of the building. Police then moved crowds back away from the building, and later south on Exchange Boulevard, into the Corn Hill neighborhood. Separately, in New York City, a car plowed through a crowd of protesters in Times Square who were also demonstrating against police brutality. On September 4, 2020, Protests began peacefully but ended with authorities dispersing crowds with tear gas and pepper balls following incidents of vandalism and violence, according to officials. Protesters started at Martin Luther King Jr. Park downtown and arrived to a blockade set up across the Court Street Bridge by police, one block from the Safety Building. Bottles and fireworks were launched at police by protesters. Police slowly pushed the crowd several blocks down Court Street. Rochester police arrested 11 people during the outbreaks of violence, the department said. According to police, three officers were hurt and were hospitalized but later released. On September 5, 2020, the fourth night of protests over the death of Daniel Prude was the largest yet, and again ended with pepper balls, tear gas and fireworks. Protesters marched from Jefferson Ave to City Hall, and next to Exchange Blvd at Broad Street, to a police roadblock outside of the Blue Cross Arena, north of the Safety Building. Six minutes after arriving, after some threw water bottles, police began dispensing crowds with tear gas, pepper spray, flash bangs and an LRAD. At least one protester launched multiple fireworks at officers from then on that night. Police continued pushing protesters north on Exchange Blvd -- which continues north of W. Main Street as State Street -- also dispersing a re-assembling crowd in front of City Hall. While most demonstrators left downtown quickly, several hundred remained on State Street for another hour or so. Several dozen stayed until about 1:30 am the next day, pushed 0.5 mile north of the roadblock to outside of Kodak Tower, before officers in squad cars finally dispersed the remaining people. Two U-Haul trucks were set on fire in a parking lot nearby before firefighters extinguished them. Rochester police arrested nine people, including two on felony charges. Three officers were also treated at the hospital for injuries. No official account of injuries to protesters was offered, but on social media there were images of protesters, local press employees and politicians hit by police launched projectiles. On September 6, 2020, roughly 1,000 people came out to protest on the fifth day, which was the first peaceful night since protests started. Rochester police reported no arrests after demonstrators descended on the city's Public Safety Building, a day after nearby demonstrations resulted in numerous clashes between protesters and police. The police presence that night was noticeably subdued, with fewer visible officers outside of the building, and a relaxed perimeter more similar to that as on September 3. The march also used \\"elders\\", namely older, respected community members to stand between the police and protesters, to both prevent and reduce the odds of a clash that night. The demonstration came hours after Mayor Lovely Warren and the city's police chief La'Ron Singletary called for calm following tense protests the previous day. = Second week = Rochester City Hall on September 10, 2020 On September 7, 2020, six naked or partially naked demonstrators sat silently outside of the Public Safety Building that morning. All had their hands behind their backs and wore spit hoods, in a reference to Prude. That night, 600–1000 people demonstrated on the sixth day of protests. Demonstrators started at Martin Luther King Jr. park and again marched to Rochester City Hall, followed by the Public Safety Building. The events were mostly peaceful, although a tense standoff between officers and protesters occurred. The police presence was initially relaxed, but changed after demonstrators became more agitated one hour after arriving at the Safety Building. Some threw bottles at police and started removing the first layer of barricades, after which an unlawful assembly was declared and dozens of officers moved in position to disperse crowds. Police remained in the same position, not forcing crowds back or using any tear gas or pepper spray that night as had previously occurred. The last protesters left without incident around 1 am. On September 8, 2020, protesters demonstrated for the seventh straight day, which ended peacefully for a third consecutive night. It came hours after Police Chief Singletary and his entire command staff (six other officials) either retired, announced intentions to retire or were demoted to their previously held positions. Protesters started on Jefferson Avenue, walked and demonstrated at the Public Safety Building and later outside of City Hall. Protesters also painted \\"Black Lives Matter\\" on Jefferson Ave, \\"Murderers\\" on Exchange Boulevard in front of the Safety Building, and \\"Resign\\" on Church Street facing City Hall. On September 9, 2020, two men who allegedly attacked police officers in Rochester during the protest on September 5 were arrested. The Justice Department announced criminal charges against Adam Green of Dansville, and Dallas Williams-Smothers of Rochester, for civil disorder during the demonstration four days before. Protesters again sat naked or partially naked in front of City Hall on September 10, 2020. More than a dozen people were wearing mesh hoods.

After attending both St. Petersburg High School and St. Petersburg Junior College, she attended the University of Florida, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. Afterwards, Orsini worked for the St. Petersburg Times, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, and the Richmond News Leader. Orsini spent forty-one years working at the St. Petersburg Times, beginning in 1946. That year, she placed second in a national contest for the \\"best-looking newspaperwoman\\". Orsini was also a body double for Lizabeth Scott in Dead Reckoning (1947). She was also a marathon waterskier. By 1963, she was the education reporter for the paper. The following year, she was involved in a marathon ski run from Saint Petersburg to New York City for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Over 28 days, a ten-person group skied the to New York. For her reporting, Orsini received the American Political Science Association Public Affairs Reporting award (1967) and a National Headliners Award (1970). In 1974, after an exposé of a scandal involving Floyd T. Christian, she received a Scripps Howard Foundation Award. Orsini began investigating the Church of Scientology and its expansion into Clearwater, Florida, in the middle of the 1970s. Over three years of investigating, she and Stafford published fourteen stories that criticized the church, investigating its belief system and corrupt practices. By 1976, a church memo was issued that deemed Stafford and Orsini 'enemies' of the church, and stated that their ranks should be infiltrated.

The Edicts are inscriptions on monumental pillars and rocks throughout South Asia that cover Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism and espouse Buddhist principles (e.g. upholding dhamma and the practice of non- violence). The Ashokan Prakrit dialects reflected local forms of the Early Middle-Indo-Aryan language. Three dialect areas are represented: Northwestern, Western, and Eastern. The Central dialect of Indo-Aryan is exceptionally not represented; instead, inscriptions of that area use the Eastern forms. Ashokan Prakrit is descended from an Old Indo-Aryan dialect closely related to Vedic Sanskrit, on occasion diverging by preserving archaisms from Proto-Indo- Aryan. Ashokan Prakrit is attested in the Brahmi script and the Kharoshthi script (only in the Northwest). Classification Masica classifies Ashokan Prakrit as an Early Middle-Indo-Aryan language, representing the earliest stage after Old Indo-Aryan in the historical development of Indo-Aryan. Pali and early Jain Ardhamagadhi (but not all of it) also represent this stage. Dialects There are three dialect groups attested in the Ashokan Edicts, based on phonological and grammatical idiosyncrasies which correspond with developments in later Middle Indo-Aryan languages: * Western: The inscriptions at Girnar and Sopara, which: prefer r over l; do not merge the nasal consonants (n, ñ, ṇ); merge all sibilants into s; prefer (c)ch as the reflex of the Old Indo-Aryan thorn cluster kṣ; among other morphological peculiarities. Notably, this dialect corresponds well with Pali, the preferred Middle Indo-Aryan language of Buddhism. * Northwestern: The inscriptions at Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra written in the Kharosthi script: retain etymological r and l as distinct; do not merge the nasals; do not merge the sibilants (s, ś, ṣ); metathesis of liquids in consonant clusters (e.g. Sanskrit dharma > Shahbazgarhi dhrama). These features are shared with the modern Dardic languages. * Eastern: The standard administrative language, exemplified by the inscriptions at Dhauli and Jaugada and used in the geographical core of the Mauryan Empire: prefer l over r, merge the nasals into n (and geminate ṁn), prefer (k)kh as the reflex of OIA kṣ, etc. Oberlies suggests that the inscriptions in the Central zone were translated from the \\"official\\" administrative forms of the Edicts. =Sample= Dhrama-dipi \\"rescript on morality\\" in Ashokan Prakrit in the Kharoshthi script at Shahbazgarhi. The following is the first sentence of the Major Rock Edict 1, inscribed in many locations. * English (Girnar): This rescript on morality has been caused to be written by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin. * Girnar: iy[aṃ] dhaṃma-lipī Devānaṃpriyena Priyadasinā rāña lekhāpitā * Kalsi: iyaṃ dhaṃma-lipi Devānaṃpiyena Piyadas[i]nā [lekhit]ā * Shahbazgarhi: [aya] dhrama-dipi Devanapriasa raño likhapitu * Mansehra: ayi dhra[ma]dip[i] Devanaṃ[priye]na Priya[draśina rajina li]khapita * Dhauli: ...

[nā lājina l]i[kha] ... * Jaugada: iyaṃ dhaṃma-lipi Khepi[ṃ]galasi pavatasi Devānaṃpiyena Piyadasinā lājinā likhāpitā The dialect groups and their differences are apparent: the Northwest retains clusters but does metathesis on liquids (dhrama vs. other dhaṃma) and retains an earlier form dipi \\"writing\\" borrowed from Iranian; meanwhile, the l/r distinctions are apparent in the word for \\"king\\" (Girnar rāña but Jaugada lājinā).

Contos explores identity, eroticism, femininity, materiality, popular culture and history. She describes her life in relation to contradictions, saying: “I make quilts for art but never for warmth. I watch cooking shows but never cook. I want to cover my home in florals, but it ends up in wine stained sequins”. Contos' practice is studio-based. Australian artist and curator Daniel Mudie Cunningham reflected on a studio visit with the artist by saying, “Imagine a happy-sad catastrophe of colour and movement; an inviting lair where tactile sculptural forms appear embalmed in recycled teenage tears.”  Collections  *National Gallery of Australia *Art Gallery of South Australia *Heide Museum of Modern Art  References   External links  * Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery * Station Gallery Category:21st-century Australian artists Category:Living people Category:21st-century Australian women artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sarah Contos"},{"id":"65201815","text":"This article encompasses the 1870s Pacific typhoon seasons.

In Valladolid she premiered her play Sáfira, with great public success, as it was published in the Revista de Teatro (Theater Magazine).

In one entitled A la Coruña, she continues the fashion of exalting her homeland, describing the landscape in a pleasant and nostalgic way. It is verse with a Costumbrist theme, with the meter and rhyme typical of erudite poetry. Her work also appeared in 1862's Álbum de la Caridad, along with that of poets such as Rosalía de Castro. She was the first Latin American woman to publish a novel in Venezuela, as a folletín of the Diario de Avisos between March and April 1853.

Course The Lobaye River forms in the west of the country, in the prefecture of Nana-Mambéré and flows in a generally southeast direction through Mambéré-Kadéï and Lobaye to its junction with the Ubangi. The Lobaye drains part of the Carnot sandstone plateau. There is potential for hydrelectric development, particularly in the section between the mouth of the Mbaéré and the Loko-Safa falls. The Lobaye is long, with an average slope of . It rises near Bouar at an elevation of about , and its upper course is called the Bali River as far as Baoro. The upper part is at first torrential, but after some rapids at from its source it flows into a wide U-shaped valley. The lower part is navigable for almost , flowing through equatorial forest. History One of the first Europeans to explore the river was the Belgian Alphonse van Gèle, in November–December 1886. On 25 July 1901 a mission led by the colonial administrator M. Dessirier de Paulwel, with 30 militia and 65 porters, left Bangui and crossed the Bonjo territory to reach Loko on the Lobay River on 1 September 1901. The mission then went north to the Carnot post on the Sangha River, which was reached on 20 October 1901. Dessirier de Paulwel concluded that the M'Bali River was not, as had been thought, the upper part of the Likouala-aux-Herbes River, a tributary of the lower Sangha, but rather was part of the Lobay River. On Hansen's map the river was shown as flowing to the east of the Sangha, but in fact it was only away at the Carnot post. The Compagnie des Caoutchoucs et Produits de la Lobay (Lobay Rubber and Products Company) was established in 1899. The company was based in Paris and had 2 million francs capital. Directors were Albert Motte, Léon Motte-Bossut, Ignace Cauvez and Ernest Grisar. The concession covered of the Lobay basin. Activities included all agricultural, forestry, mining, industrial, commercial, etc. operations aimed at exploiting this concession or facilitating its exploitation. In 1910 the company was taken over by Ékela- Kadei-Sangha, and became part of the Compagnie forestière Sangha-Oubangui. Conservation The Basse-Lobaye Biosphere Reserve protects part of the forest along the lower part of the river. It has an area of . There is no buffer zone. Vegetation is dense semi-deciduous tropical humid forest, a young forest with a closed understory, mostly gallery forest. There are scattered Pygmy camps.

Formal alternatives to the full name include the United States, America, as well as the initialisms U.S. and the U.S.A.; colloquial names include \\"the States\\", the \\"U.S. of A\\", and \\"Columbia\\". It is generally accepted that the name \\"America\\" derives from the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. The term dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, in honor of Vespucci. The full name \\"United States of America\\" was first used during the American Revolutionary War, though its precise origin is a matter of contention. The newly formed union was first known as the \\"United Colonies\\", and the earliest known usage of the modern full name dates from a letter written between two military officers. The Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson, and the Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, both contain the name \\"United States of America\\". The name was officially adopted by the second Continental Congress on .  Etymology  = America = Waldseemüller map closeup showing the name America The earliest known use of the name \\"America\\" dates to 1505, when German poet Matthias Ringmann used it in a poem about the New World. The word is a Latinized form of the first name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass, rather than the eastern limit of Asia. On , the map Universalis Cosmographia, created by German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, was published alongside this poem. The map uses the label \\"America\\" for what is now known as South America. In 1538, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name \\"America\\" on his own world map, applying it to the entire Western Hemisphere. Alternative theories suggest that \\"America\\" derives from the Amerrisque Mountains of Nicaragua, or from the surname of wealthy Anglo-Welsh merchant Richard Amerike. = United States of America = The first documentary evidence of the phrase \\"United States of America\\" dates from a , letter written by Stephen Moylan, Esquire, to George Washington's aide-de-camp Joseph Reed. Moylan was fulfilling Reed's role during the latter's absence.DeLear, Byron (July 4, 2013) Who coined 'United States of America'? Mystery might have intriguing answer. Moylan expressed his wish to go \\"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.Touba, Mariam (November 5, 2014) Who Coined the Phrase 'United States of America'? You May Never Guess \\"Here, on January 2, 1776... Stephen Moylan, an acting secretary to General George Washington, spells it out, 'I should like vastly to go with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain' to seek foreign assistance for the cause.\\" New-York Historical Society Museum & LibraryFay, John (July 15, 2016) The forgotten Irishman who named the 'United States of America' \\"According to the NY Historical Society, Stephen Moylan was the man responsible for the earliest documented use of the phrase 'United States of America'.\\" IrishCentral.com The first known publication of the phrase \\"United States of America\\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on . It is commonly mistaken that Thomas Paine coined the term in his pamphlet Common Sense, published in January 1776, but he never used the final form. The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed no later than , declared \\"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'.\\" The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that \\"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.\\" In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \\"original Rough draught\\" of the Declaration of Independence. This draft of the document did not surface until , and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation. In any case, the Declaration of Independence was the first official document to use the nation's new title.  History  In the early days of the American Revolution, the colonies as a unit were most commonly referred to as the \\"United Colonies\\". For example, president of the Continental Congress Richard Henry Lee wrote in a June 7, 1776 resolution: \\"These United Colonies are, and of right, ought to be, free and independent States.\\" Before 1776, names for the colonies varied significantly; they included \\"Twelve United English Colonies of North America\\", \\"United Colonies of North America\\", and others. On September 9, 1776, the Second Continental Congress officially changed the nation's name to the \\"United States of America\\". In the first few years of the United States, however, there remained some discrepancies of usage. In the Treaty of Alliance (1778) with France, the term \\"United States of North America\\" was used. In accordance with this usage, when the Congress was drawing bills of exchange for French commissioners on May 19, 1778, they decided to use this term. President of the Continental Congress Henry Laurens even wrote that \\"Congress have adopted the Stile of the Treaties of Paris, 'the United States of North America'.\\" Congress, however, reconsidered this change on July 11, 1778 and resolved to drop \\"North\\" from the bills of exchange, making them consistent with the name adopted in 1776. The term \\"America\\" was seldom used in the United States before the 1890s, and rarely used by presidents before Theodore Roosevelt. It does not appear in patriotic songs composed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\", and the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\", although it is common in 20th-century songs like \\"God Bless America\\".Historian Daniel Immerwahr, speaking on Becoming America – NPR Throughline Podcast The name \\"Columbia\\", popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus. Many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia and the District of Columbia. = Usage as a singular noun = The headline of Foster's column The phrase \\"United States\\" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., \\"the United States are\\"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865. The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War, and is now standard. However, the plural form is retained in the idiom \\"these United States\\". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit. The transition from plural to singular was gradual. In a May 4, 1901, column in the New York Times titled \\"ARE OR IS? Whether a Plural or Singular Verb Goes With the Words United States\\", former Secretary of State John W. Foster noted that early statesmen such as Alexander Hamilton and Daniel Webster had used the singular form, as well as the Treaty of Paris (1898) and Hay–Pauncefote Treaty of 1900; conversely, most Supreme Court decisions still used the plural form. He concludes that \\"since the civil war the tendency has been towards [singular] use.\\" Mark Liberman of the University of Pennsylvania found that, in the corpus of Supreme Court opinions, the transition to singular usage occurred in the early 1900s. Among English-language books, the transition happened earlier, around 1880.  Usage  The name \\"United States\\" is usually sufficiently unambiguous; \\"United States of America\\" may be used in titles or when extra formality is desired. However, \\"United States\\" and \\"U.S.\\" may be used adjectivally, while the full name cannot. English usage of \\"America\\" rarely refers to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of \\"Americas\\" as the totality of North and South America. Colloquial names include the \\"U.S. of A.\\" and, internationally, \\"the States\\". Even more informal names include \\"Murica\\" and \\"Merica\\", which imply a jocular and sometimes derogatory tone; these names come from stereotypical white southerners' pronunciation of the word. The official U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual prescribes specific usages for \\"U.S.\\" and \\"United States\\". In treaties, congressional bills, etc., \\"United States\\" is always used. In a sentence containing the name of another country, \\"United States\\" must be used. Otherwise, \\"U.S.\\" is used preceding a government organization or as an adjective, but \\"United States\\" is used as an adjective preceding non-governmental organizations (e.g. United States Steel Corporation). Style guides conflict over how various names for the United States should be used. The Chicago Manual of Style, until the 17th edition, required \\"US\\" and \\"U.S.\\" to be used as an adjective; it now permits the usage of both as a noun, though \\"United States\\" is still preferred in this case. The Associated Press Stylebook permits the usage of \\"US\\" and \\"U.S.\\" as both adjectives and nouns, though \\"US\\" (without the periods) is only allowed in headlines. APA Style, in contrast, only allows \\"U.S.\\" to be used as an adjective, and disallows \\"US\\".  Other languages  In Spanish, the U.S. is known as Estados Unidos, literally \\"United States\\". The Americas are known simply as América. Spanish uses estadounidense for the adjectival form. In Chinese, the U.S. is known as 美国 (). Literally \\"beautiful country\\", it in fact comes from the second character of the transliteration of America as \\"亚美利加\\" (). The Americas are known as 美洲 (), with the same etymology. In Hindi, the U.S. is transliterated to अमेरिका (amerika).

Biography  Skidmore was born in Canberra, Australia and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Bachelor of Science from the Australian National University and a Master of Arts and PhD in anthropology from McGill University, Canada. Skidmore's work in anthropology began in Cambodia and combined religious, political and medical anthropology, exploring the psychological strategies Cambodians used to survive in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge genocide. This work was awarded the international H.B.M. Murphy Prize in Medical Anthropology.Skidmore, M. (1995), “The Politics of Space and Form: Cultural Idioms of Resistance and Remembering”, Santé, Culture, Health, Vol. 10, No. 1-2, Pp. 33-72 Skidmore moved to Montreal to pursue graduate studies in Southeast Asia and also studied Burmese language at the University of Wisconsin. She received the Wenner Gren Foundation funding for doctoral fieldwork in Myanmar and in 1996 was given the first unrestricted fieldwork research visa for Burma (Myanmar) since the advent of military dictatorship in 1988. Skidmore's work revealed the depths of fear, repression and self-censorship Burmese people suffered under successive Burmese military regimes and meticulously documents the many survival strategies used to remain hopeful for the future when terror and fear threaten to overwhelm the population. Karaoke Fascism: Burma and the Politics of Fear was published by University of Pennsylvania Press (a shorter article appeared in American Ethnologist) and was the first book-length expose of living under a repression of fear in contemporary Myanmar. Skidmore's work in Burma covered diverse cultural, medical, political and religious aspects of everyday life at a time when the world was largely excluded from entering Myanmar and when foreigners were heavily restricted in their interactions with Burmese people and places. Skidmore worked and lived in peri-urban slums in Mandalay and Rangoon (Yangon) as well as the Yangon Psychiatric Hospital, Yangon Drug Rehabilitation Hospital, and the Yangon Traditional Medicine Clinic. Much of this work centered on the cultural beliefs and practices as well as structural inequalities and state repression that impact the psychological and psychiatric health of women and children. Over almost 20 years her fieldwork included research with monks, alchemists, magical monks, midwives, sex workers, child soldiers, writers and artists, political activists, and senior military figures from rebel armies in Eastern Myanmar = Academic Career = Skidmore began academic life as a tenured lecturer at the University of Melbourne and then as a senior postdoctoral research fellow in the Joan B.

Her research is focused primarily on the animal welfare science, including poultry production, cognitive abilities of domestic animals and the impact of humans on the welfare of wild animals. Nicol's work has been internationally recognized. She was awarded Prince Laurent Foundation prize in 2001. She is the recipient of several awards such as UFAW Award and Medal for Outstanding Achievement, European Association for Animal Production A.M.

Her work has contributed to EU ban on conventional battery cages for laying hens in 2012. She was recognized as an ASAB Tinbergen Lecturer in 2017.  Education  Nicol completed her Bachelors in Zoology and her Ph.D. from Oxford University in 1981 and 1986 respectively.  Career  Nicol started her academic career in 1985 as a lecturer at University of Bristol. At the university, she was promoted to Reader in 1994 and then taught as a Professor of Animal Welfare from 2001 till 2017. During this time, she held visiting positions at Hamilton and McGill Universities and University of Waikato. In 2018, she was appointed as Professor at the Royal Veterinary College. She was appointed as an Honorary Senior Research Associate at University of Oxford and as Honorary Visiting Professor at University of Lincoln in 2017. Apart from academic positions, Nicol also held research and administrative positions and Chaired the ASAB Education Committee from 1994 till 1996. She was appointed as Field Chief Editor at Frontiers in Animal Science in 2020. Nicol wrote and presented a BBC radio series on animal ethics for a non-specialist audience. = Research and work = Nicol's research focuses on animal welfare science as the primary research area. She has conducted significant research on the methods used in this field. In her research about the need of hens to flap their wings in a cage environment, experiments in a controlled setting were conducted, differences between the control and experiment group were observed and the rebound rate was recorded during the experiment replication. This showed that hens did not adapt to living in a battery cage She has also conducted investigations on how closely the commonly used welfare assessing measures are tied to animals’ preferences and environmental choices. She placed hens in three different environments and observed the environmental preferences for each animal. The findings provide a way of validating and justifying welfare indicators that can be used in practice. Nicol has also researched on understanding the abnormal behavior in domestic animals. She authored an article observing the abnormal oral behavior in horses due to dietary changes. The horses were administrated an antacid diet to control the crib-biting behavior of horses. The experiment indicated a decline in crib-biting behavior with the antacid diet. Nicol has conducted significant research on the role of ethics in animal welfare and scientific procedures. Her research suggests that the current limits on severity are not sufficient to protect animals. She authored an article presenting her stance against the use of live animals in experiments involving severe suffering such as exposure to events that threaten the biological or social functions of animals. She presents an ethical case in favor of imposing a ban on the use of animals in harmful experiments. Along with advocating the regulatory ban on the involvement of animals in severely harmful experiments, Nicol also researched on the cognitive processes and animal sentience of domestic animals. She examined the cognitive influences on the avian maternal response in hens by manipulating chicks’ knowledge and observing the change in hen's response to chicks that appeared to be mildly distressed. It was found that hens experience emotional empathy and integrate their prior knowledge with the chick's distress cues and then exhibit an adaptive response. Nicol extended her research to study the impact of humans on wild animal populations. In early 2020s, she authored an article shedding light on the ‘Anthropogenic Threats to Wild Cetacean Welfare’ and also suggested the use of a welfare assessment tool for wild cetaceans for bridging information gaps present in policy making. In 2015, Nicol authored a book called “The Behavioural Biology of Chickens” which was reviewed in 2016 by Paul M. Hocking. He states the book “covers a wide range of applied biology and behavior” and also refers to the book as an “excellent resource for more detailed research”.

She is voiced by Sarah Nicole- Robles. Some called her the \\"first bisexual lead character\\" on a Disney Channel show.  Creation  According to Terrace, Luz is named after her Dominican-American roommate, Luz Batista, a story artist and consultant for the show. Terrace also said that Luz's character evolved from conversations she had with Luz Batista, who later became her best friend. Later, Nancy Kanter, EVP, Content and Creative Strategy of Disney Channels Worldwide explained that while they loved the \\"combination of magic and mystery in this other world\\" of The Owl House, they really \\"fell in love with the main character Luz,\\" leading them to green-light the show itself. This connected with Terrace's hope that audiences are \\"entertained by Luz’s world and her off-the-wall adventures.\\" On July 7, 2020, series creator Dana Terrace, when responding to a fan who posted a still of Amity putting her hands on Luz's shoulder, from a promotion for the upcoming episode \\"Enchanting Grom Fright\\" on Twitter, said that there is no heterosexual explanation for the moment. Later, on August 10, Terrace confirmed on Twitter that the episode features a bisexual character, but didn't confirm whether this was Amity, Luz, or both, but many fans assumed this referred to Luz. On September 2, during a Reddit AMA, Dana Terrace confirmed that Amity is intended to be a lesbian and that Luz is bisexual. She also stated that the relationship between Amity and Luz will be explored in Season 2 and that Luz is \\"oblivious to some things in front of her,\\" including Amity's crush on her. In the same AMA, Terrace stated that Luz was Amity's first crush and that she was thrilled to see people connect to the show's characters, like Luz and Amity.  Character  Luz Noceda is a 14-year-old Dominican-American girl who wears a cat-ear hooded indigo-and-white T-shirt, denim shorts, black leggings, and white shoes and has black hair and brown eyes. Luz is very quirky, outgoing, and unpredictable. She is a fan of the novel series The Good Witch Azura. She loves fantasy to the point of being detached from reality and has a hard time making friends. However she still does have a heart and good intentions. In the first episode of the series her mother sends her to a reality-check camp, but she accidentally ends up going to the Boiling Isles instead through the portal in a nearby house instead. Due to her love of all things fantasy and magical, she wants to become a witch. She soon becomes a friend of a small wolf-like demon with a skull-like head named King, and Eda's apprentice. Later, Luz enters Hexside Academy as a new exchange student.  Reception  Luz's character was received positively. She was described by some as a teen who \\"aligns herself with a witch and a demon\\" to fulfill her dream to become a witch, and praised her character, with some calling her a \\"fantasy-loving human.\\" Others praised the plotlines of episodes where Luz explored the magic school and met other witches of the same age, and growing relationship between Luz and Amity. In the season 1 episode \\"Enchanting Grom Fright,\\" Luz and Amity dance together for the first time. Spencer Wan says that he's \\"never been prouder of any board.\\" Alex Hirsch (voice of King, creator of Gravity Falls, and Terrace's partner) was very proud of Disney for including this scene in an episode. After it was confirmed that Luz was bisexual, actress Lili Reinhart, who plays Grace in Chemical Hearts, welcomed the development, saying that often people have told her that being bisexual is \\"a phase,\\" and felt validated by Luz's character.

The region is one of exceptionally high biodiversity, similar to Borneo and New Guinea islands. Many endangered mammals species (including the Sumatran rhinocerous and the Lar gibbon) are present, and over 450 species of birds have been found in the region. In recent years, illegal logging and human encroachment have put great strain on this ecoregion.  Location and description  The ecoregion runs for 1,600 km down the northeast and southwest sides of the Barisan Mountains on the island of Sumatra. The ecoregion thus surrounds the higher elevation Sumatran montane rain forests ecoregion. The lowlands rainforest is at an average elevation of , and a maximum of . Also in this region are the islands of Simeulue, Nias (both about 150 km off the west coast), and Bangka Island off the east coast.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month. The lowland rain forests on the west side of the Barisan Mountains are wetter (6,000 mm/year) than those on the east side (2,500+ mm/year).  Flora and fauna  The characteristics trees in the lowland rain forest are those of family Dipterocarpaceae (Greek: di = two, pteron = wing and karpos = fruit). On Sumatra, 111 species of these trees have been recorded, six of which are endemic. These trees in the canopy can reach 90 meters in height. The dipterocarps in the understory are joined by smaller trees of the 'peacock flower' family (Caesalpinioideae). Other trees include Torchwood trees (Burseraceae), evergreens of the family Sapotaceae, member of the Coffee tree family (Rubiaceae), members of the Soursop family (Annonaceae), Laurels (Lauraceae), and (Myristicaceae). Trees of the Mulberry family (Moraceae) are also common, with over 100 species. Epiphiytes (plants that grow on the surface of others and gather moisture from the atmosphere or surroundings) are common. There is little ground vegetation, mostly saplings of canopy trees. The soils are commonly Podzols in the lowland rain forest. Animals and birds are very diverse, with species similar to Borneo and the Malaysian Peninsula as all three landmasses were connected in the last ice age. Mammals of conservation interest include the endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), the endangered Lar gibbon (Hylobates lar) (the Sumatran rain forests contain many species of primates), the endangered Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), and the critically endangered Sumatran rhinocerous (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis). Over 450 species of birds have been recorded. Many endemic species are found in the biodiversity hotspot around Lake Toba, located in the caldera of a supervolcano.

It is one of the border towns in the United States with a portmanteau name. Pen Mar came to prominence as a resort in the 20th century after the construction of Pen Mar Park by the Western Maryland Railway. While the resort has long been dismantled, the area still has some significance in Maryland, since it is the northern starting point for the Maryland section of the Appalachian Trail. History Glen Afton Spring, near Pen Mar Park The Pen Mar area became prominent in the late 19th century with the development of a formal resort there in 1877. Colonel John Mifflin Hood rightly believed that a resort area in the Blue Ridge Mountains would encourage the public to use his trains from the Western Maryland Railroad to travel to the area. Not only did the Western Maryland Railroad develop a resort but also an amusement park that included a scenic lookout, roller coaster, movie theater, dance pavilion, picnic shelter, miniature train, photo studio, concession stand, carousel with a penny arcade, dining hall and children's playground. The park was a huge success with thousands of visitors taking the 71-mile trip from Baltimore to Pen Mar. The single day park attendance reached close to 20,000 visitors. The growth of the park naturally led to the growth of the village of Pen Mar. The town of Pen Mar was officially incorporated in 1920Archives of Maryland, Volume 0539, Page 0282 - Session Laws, 1920 with an act to add new sections to Article 22 of the code of public laws of Maryland. The town had a post office, many hotels and over 100 boarding houses during this time of growth. Yet, strangely enough, the act to incorporate the town was repealed in 1922. High Rock, c. 1880 The end of the 1920s started the demise of the once glorious park. By the end of the decade \\"virtually no one travelled here by train.\\" By 1929 the park was not turning a profit for the Western Maryland Railroad. The park was subsequently leased to a private investor who was able to keep the park going until 1943.Greater Emmitsburg Historical Society. \\"Pen Mar Park.\\" Thurmont Scrapbook. Accessed 2011-06-05. With the fall of the park, the fall of the surrounding area came as no surprise. The Pen Mar post office officially closed in the 1960s and the area slowly dwindled in size and stature within the state of Maryland. In 1953 a petition was circulated in the Pen Mar community, in support of creating a state park at the former resort site. Pen Mar was designated a state park in 1963–64. However, for unknown reasons the park was never made into a Maryland state park. The park was sold to Washington County and turned into a county park, which opened in 1977. Additions to the park since then have included a scenic overlook and a multi- use pavilion. In 1978 a nomination form was prepared to describe a \\"Pen Mar Historic District\\" for the National Register of Historic Places, but no further actions on this nomination are noted. Geography Pen Mar is located at (39.7178725, -77.5063788). Pen Mar is located on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania on South Mountain. The village is at an altitude of above sea level. The area overlooks one of the breaks in the mountain range giving views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. To the south of Pen Mar Park is High Rock, a recreational site within South Mountain State Park. The site is close to the Appalachian Trail, features a popular overlook and is used as a hang glider launch site.

Life  Born in Königsberg in der Neumark, Döbbelin studied aw at the Martin Luther University of Halle- Wittenberg, where he had to flee early without a degree because of involvement in a tumult, and joined the society of Friederike Caroline Neuber in 1750. After years with wandering troupes of actors, he founded his own troupe, but he had to give it up after a short time. Also a second society, which he formed in 1757 and with which he played in the Rhine area, disbanded after one year. After that, Döbbelin was a member of the Ackermannsche Gesellschaft until 1766 and then went to Berlin to the director , whom he helped to abolish the comedy. Döbbelin separated from him in 1767 and founded a third company, with which he travelled through several Prussian provinces and brought Lessing's Minna von Barnhelm to success in Berlin in 1768. At the in Braunschweig Lessing's Emilia Galotti was premiered under his direction in 1772. After the death of , he was granted the privilege for Berlin. In 1775, he opened his own Döbbelinsches Theater in the , which became a permanent stage from that time on. In the autumn of 1777, Johann André followed a call from Döbbelin to become music director of the Döbbelinisches Orchester. He developed an extensive activity as a composer of Singspiele and conducted his own and foreign works. His successor in 1784 became Johann Christian Frischmuth until his death in 1790 - from 1788 with Karl Bernhard Wessely. The Döbbelin's stage was the venue for many theatre-historically significant performances. The guest performance of the Hamburg actor in December 1777 deserves special mention: Brockmann played Hamlet in Shakespeare's play of the same name on 12 evenings in front of a sold out audience. Shakespeare's Othello was first performed in Berlin on 29 April 1775 in a translation by Johann Joachim Eschenburg. Döbbelin himself appeared in the title role.Königlich Preußischer Staats-Anzeiger, No. 37, 13 February, Döbbelin's passion for Shakespeare was inspired by Lessing of which Daniel Chodowiecki produced a series of pictures. In 1783, the first performance of Lessing's Nathan the Wise took place here, in which Döbbelin also embodied the first Nathan. On 8 March 1784, there was also the Berlin premiere of Schiller's Die Verschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua, edited by .

It was opened on 5 December 1787 with a speech \\"composed and spoken\\" by Döbbelin. On January 2 1787, the Fiesko was performed again under the direction of Döbbelin, but after a dispute with him, the theatre was placed under royal administration. It was closed on 31 December 1801 and a new building was constructed.Königlich Preußischer Staats-Anzeiger, Nr. 56, 7 March 1866, As a theatre director, Döbbelin strove for a purified stage and knew how to attract the best forces such as Ferdinand Fleck, Joseph Anton Christ, Margarete Schick and others. As an actor, he was especially liked in typical roles, but his main merit is seen in the assertion of the German drama at a time when almost exclusively works by French and Italian authors were performed in the original language.Döbbelin, Carl Theophil on Weber GesamtAusgabe His first wife was Maximiliana Christiana Döbbelin (?-1759), Friederike von Alvensleben's second daughter (1739-1793), who played the female leading roles in his companies with great success. When Döbbelin was arrested in Leipzig 1774 because of gambling debts, she did not release him, but went into business for herself with some actors and went to Dresden, where she also met the courtly society. After his release, she went with him to Berlin and Potsdam, where she gave Minna and Emilia. in addition, Goethe's Clavigo and Die Lügner by Carlo Goldoni were also performed.

Career  Feroz was an assistant professor of accounting at the State University of New York at Buffalo from 1983 till 1986 and at the Baruch College of the City University of New York from 1986 till 1989. He was a visiting assistant professor of accounting at the University of Minnesota from 1989 to 1991. He was a tenured associate professor of accounting at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) from 1991 till 1993, and a full professor of accounting at UMD from 1993 till 2005. While teaching at UMD, he was selected to serve as the Special Project Associate of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Administration in 1995. In 2005, he became a tenured full professor of accounting at the University of Washington, Tacoma’s Milgard School of Business, and served as the Director of the Master of Accounting Program from 2016 till 2020. Feroz also served three consecutive terms (2002-2009) as a member of the US Comptroller General’s Advisory Council on Government Auditing Standards.  Research and work  Feroz’s major contributions have been to the governance of the financial accounting regulatory standards, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulatory enforcement actions, institutional theory, and the governance of the public and private sector institutions. His published articles in the premier academic journals have impacted the interdisciplinary thought processes through numerous follow-up studies in accounting, finance and environmental economy, and subsequent legislative enactments. In particular, the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Section 704 Study of Enforcement Actions was preceded by the seminal contributions of Feroz, Kyung Joo Park and Victor S. Pastena. In 1991, Feroz co-authored a paper entitled,\\"The Financial and Market Effects of the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases,\\" with Kyung Joo Park and Victor S Pastena. The paper explored the types of accounting and auditing problems which lead to enforcement actions by the SEC, the consequences of investigations on target's financial statements, and market perception of such actions by SEC. SEC's governance enforcement program is designed \\"to concentrate on particular problem areas and to anticipate emerging problems.\\" After examining 224 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, Feroz and his co-authors described the results of investigations against 188 firms. According to their results, the SEC \\"most often pursued overstatements of accounts receivable and inventories resulting from premature revenue recognition and delayed write-off, respectively.\\" The income effects of these financial disclosure violations averaged more than 50% of reported income. They found that disclosing these reporting violations changed the \\"expectations of target’s future earnings as reflected in financial analysts’ reduced earnings estimated after the disclosures.\\" Feroz’s article with Vivian L. Carpenter entitled, \\"Institutional Theory and Accounting Rule Choice: Analyses of the Four US State Government’s Decisions to Adopt Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,\\" analyzed four US state governments’ decisions to adopt generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for external financial reporting. In this research, he and his coauthor developed the institutional theory to explain how institutional pressures exerted on the four US state governments influenced the decisions of these governments to adopt or resist the use of GAAP for external financial reporting. The authors identified resource dependency on the government bonds market as a potent form of coercive institutional pressure that was associated with early GAAP adoptions. The main contribution of this study are the articulation of the sources of institutional pressures that affect the choice of accounting governance practices by state governments, and the identification of conditions under which resource dependency has its greatest influence as an effective coercive institutional pressure for changing accounting governance rule choices in the public sector. The authors also demonstrate that the power with which institutional pressures can influence governance practices vary over time, given the set of actors in place and their initial strategic response to institutional pressure for change. They also documented that there can be significant variation in the presence and effect of institutional pressures over time based on constantly changing endogenous and exogenous factors, including cognitive beliefs of the organizational decision makers. Inspired by Coase’s theory of the firm (1937), Feroz’s article with Sungsoo Kim and Raymond Raab entitled, \\"Financial Statement Analysis: A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach,\\" demonstrated that Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can augment the traditional ratio analysis especially, if the goal is to provide a consistent and reliable measure of the firm-specific production or managerial efficiencies of a firm. The authors empirically demonstrated their case by using time series data from the oil and gas, pharmaceutical, and primary metals industries. Feroz’s recent research topics include the governance of the financial accounting regulatory standards (scholarly monograph in-progress), and textual and contextual analysis of the US SEC's governance enforcement pronouncements.

She has served as Deputy Mayor of Vienna since 2019, as well as City Councillor for Urban Development, Transport, Climate Protection, Energy Planning, and Citizen Participation. Since 2019, she has been the inaugural chairwoman of the Vienna Greens. She previously served as a member of the Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna from 2010 to 2019. Personal life Hebein has lived in Vienna since 1986. She is a qualified social worker, and was employed by Caritas Vienna from 1990 to 1992. She also worked in other NGO areas and was active in the conscientious objection group Gruppe für Totalverweigerung (Group for Total Refusal). Political career Hebein was responsible for security policy in the Austrian Students' Association from 1996 to 1997. She was elected district councillor for Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus on the Greens list in the 2005 local elections, and served as group chairwoman from 2007. Hebein was elected to the Gemeinderat and Landtag in the 2010 Viennese state election. Since then, she has been the social spokeswoman for the Vienna Greens. Hebein is secretary of the communist youth organisation \\"Free Austrian Youth - Movement for Socialism\\" (FÖJ-BfS). When hundreds of refugees arrived at Vienna's Westbahnhof railway station in early September 2015, Hebein organized and negotiated with the authorities and ÖBB. In 2018 she drew attention to herself through her commitment to negotiations for the new Vienna minimum income and criticism of the alcohol ban in public spaces. She argued that the ban only leads to displacement, and suggested instead that moderate alcohol consumption should be permitted in care facilities for the homeless so that they do not have to rely on public space. =2018 Greens leadership election= In November 2018, the Vienna Greens held an election to determine their lead candidate for the next state election. After incumbent Deputy Mayor and two-time lead candidate Maria Vassilakou announced her pending retirement and decision not to compete, the election was considered an open contest. Hebein announced her candidacy two days later on 4 September. She was considered a dark horse candidate, described by Der Standard as a representative of the left \\"Fundi\\" wing of the party. Hebein won 33% of votes cast in the first round, placing second behind Peter Kraus and ahead of candidates David Ellensohn, Benjamin Kaan, and Marihan Abensperg-Traun. In the fourth and final round of voting, she won the election with 49% of votes to Kraus's 45% (the remainder were invalid). Contrary to the speculation of commentators, she clarified that she would continue the Greens' coalition with the SPÖ until the scheduled election date in 2020. Her reputation as a left- winger was reinforced by a widely-reported quip she made shortly after her victory: \\"Yes, of course I do left-wing politics. What else?\\" During her first major appearance in front of the party base on 1 December, Hebein voiced her support for a restructuring and opening of the Greens. She stated her aim is to make the party more nimble and action-oriented, but that they should remain ecologically-centred. =Deputy Mayor= Upon Maria Vassilakou's retirement from politics in June 2019, Hebein succeeded her as deputy Mayor and city councillor. The Greens' state congress held at the time voted to change the statutes and, for the first time, establish the office of party chairperson. Hebein thus became the first party chairwoman of the Vienna Greens. At a party conference in February 2020, Hebein was formally chosen as the Greens' lead candidate for the October state election. The Greens won 14.8% in the election, their best result to date. They increased their representation in the Gemeinderat and Landtag from 10 to 16 seats. Afterwards, Hebein called for a renewal of the incumbent SPÖ–Green government, citing the result as a \\"very clear mandate\\" for its continuation.

David's family were cloth-makers and ran a weaving factory. He became involved in local government after serving as an officer in the city's police force. David, a Francophile and Republican, was appointed mayor of the city after the French annexation of the Prince- Bishopric of Liège. He resigned in 1808 after disagreeing with one of the Emperor Napoleon's decrees but remained involved in the running of the city. When Verviers was incorporated into the United Netherlands David secured a seat on the city's Regency Council. During the 1830 Belgian Revolution David supported independence for Belgium as a republic and when this proved unachievable voted for union with France. David was subsequently appointed the first mayor of Verviers within the independent Kingdom of Belgium, holding this position until his death. David was responsible for establishing the city's first fire brigade and creating a new cemetery to replace its inner- city burial ground. He also supported low-cost housing for workers, established a secondary school and several charitable organisations. David played a key role in constructing the city's second river crossing and also planted numerous lime trees. After his death he was memorialised in a fountain in the city centre, in which his heart was entombed. Several busts of David survive in the city and some of its streets are named after him.  Early life  Pierre David was born on 9 January 1771 to Pierre David and Catherine- Joseph Jacob David. The David family was involved in cloth manufacture and Pierre maintained a factory with 26 looms that employed 20 workers. His brother Jean-Nicolas David maintained a factory at Lambermont, west of Verviers, that had 140 looms and 200 workers. Pierre David was noted for his patriotism during the 1789 Liège Revolution and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Verviers police force by César-Constantin-François de Hoensbroeck, after the re-establishment of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. He was sworn in on 20 February 1792, at the same time as Jean-Nicolas who was appointed adjutant. They were assigned particular responsibility for the Brassine (brewery) district.  Civic official  Liège was annexed by the French First Republic in 1795 and Verviers became part of the Ourthe department of France. David, a Francophile and supporter of the French Revolution, was appointed a municipal officer by the French authorities on 20 April 1799 and became maire (mayor) on 4 July 1800. David established a fire brigade in Verviers in 1802 and in 1808 supported the construction of low-cost housing for workers. Decrees from Napoleon, following the establishment of the First French Empire, threatened the freedom David had enjoyed as mayor and on 21 September 1808 he resigned the position. Succeeded by Jean-Toussaint Rutten, David remained a key adviser with a significant role in the management of the city. Verviers city hall Verviers was captured by forces of the Sixth Coalition on 5 February 1814, as part of the Campaign in north-east France. David was appointed by the coalition as a member of their commission d'arrondissement for the area. After the Congress of Vienna Verviers and the rest of Belgium were absorbed into the Kingdom of the Netherlands. David afterwards secured a seat on the city's Regency Council. In 1817 David closed the old church cemetery in the city and established a new cemetery on the outskirts. In 1830 the Belgian Revolution against Dutch rule began and David, a supporter of the Belgian cause, sat on the Commission of Public Safety. He was also a member of the National Congress and was one of nine members who voted for the establishment of a Belgian republic and, later, voted for Belgium to be annexed to France. David was appointed the first burgomaster (mayor) of Verviers under the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830. David played a key role in stabilising the city in the aftermath of the revolution, during which it had been damaged. He led a campaign to build a second bridge across the Vesdre in the city, laying the foundation stone personally on 9 May 1832. The following year David received the royal visit of King Leopold I and his new Queen Louise-Marie. David survived local government reforms in 1836, securing re-election as a city councillor and being reappointed as mayor by Royal decree. During his time in office he established a secondary school as well as a number of charitable organisations and planted 53 lime (Tilia spp.) trees on the Promenade des Récollets to provide shade.  Death and legacy  Fontaine David in Place Verte David never married and lived with his sister on a farm in the city district. On 30 June 1839 David had gone up into his hay loft to air it out. The door had swollen due to heavy rain and in trying to force it open the hinges broke and he fell through it. David hit his head and died instantly. A large number of city residents went to the mortuary to view David's corpse. The Regency Council arranged David's funeral for 2 July at the and requested that local businesses release their workers at 4pm to attend. After the service a funeral procession accompanied the body to the cemetery. After his death all three of the city's rival newspapers praised David, despite their differing political stances (liberal, conservative and republican). Prior to his burial surgeons had reconstructed the bones in David's face, damaged during his fall, to allow for a death mask to be made, this is now on display in the city museum. A portrait of David was commissioned from Laurent Olivier to hang in the city hall and is now also in the museum's collection. A bust by B Delbove is located in city hall. In 1843 David had a railway locomotive named after him and the city considered naming a new bridge in his honour, but opted to call it the Pont du Chêne (Oak Bridge) instead. David's brother had named his son Pierre in his honour and his son was also named after him, both men were involved in local and national government. Three days after David's death, with his family's permission, his heart was removed with the intention of entombing it within a suitable memorial structure. It was preserved in a jar of alcohol within a zinc casket. Disagreements over the type of memorial and funding meant that the heart sat in storage at the city hall for four decades. A memorial fountain, the Fontaine David in the city's Place Verte, was designed by Clément Vivroux and inaugurated on 25 June 1883. The fountain underwent extensive renovation works in 2020 and on 20 August the heart was rediscovered. It was found within a hollowed stone near to a bust of David. Its zinc casket was found to be engraved with the text \\"The heart of Pierre David was solemnly placed in the monument on 25 June 1883\\" in French. The case was put on display at the city's Fine Arts Museum until 20 September. In 1889, the 50th anniversary of his death, a medal commemorating David was struck. Several busts of David, and a number of streets named in his honour, remain in Verviers.

The station was owned and operated alongside radio station WRAY (1250 AM). It broadcast regular programming for just seven months, from December 1953 to July 1954, but broadcast one day a year through 1960 to carry a March of Dimes telethon. History The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the application of the Princeton Broadcasting Corporation, owner of WRAY, to build a television station on Princeton's assigned channel 52 on March 12, 1953. WRAY announced that it would use as much of the existing facilities and personnel as it could, expanding its building on Broadway Street to house the new operation. The facility was designed with a north–south directional pattern, to beam a signal toward Vincennes and Evansville. Program features of the independent station, which began broadcasting December 11, included local news, wrestling, and the \\"Bar 52 Theatre\\" each afternoon. On July 15, 1954, it was announced that the station would go off air until September 11 to carry out a financial reorganization, citing a lack of advertising revenue. Unlike many UHF stations that were struggling against superior VHF competition, WRAY-TV was far from the nearest VHF outlet, at Louisville, Kentucky—more than away—but it was competing with the two UHF outlets in the Evansville market, at a time when the market could not support three outlets. The channel 52 facility, however, would not remain completely dormant. While it was fully operational, the station aired its first March of Dimes telethon. Even though WRAY-TV had gone silent, the underlying permit was still active, and with the support of station and March of Dimes officials and the blessing of the FCC, the station began broadcasting for 30 hours a year, just to air the telethon. Raising thousands of dollars each year, the telethon featured a variety of dignitaries, attractions, and famous personalities, including Princeton native Gil Hodges. The first telethon ran 18 hours. By 1960, the last year, more than 1,000 people appeared before the station's cameras; hundreds flocked to the radio and television studio, and the National Guard was called out to handle the crowds for the 30-hour event. In late 1960, Vincennes University purchased the channel 52 equipment and filed to have the allocation moved north to Vincennes so that equipment did not need to be modified to work on channel 44, which had been assigned to that town. Vincennes applied for a television station on channel 52 in 1964, but successive reallocations by the FCC meant that WVUT-TV, the university's station, would broadcast on channel 22 instead.

It states that, for given numbers of triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, heptagons, and other polygons other than hexagons, there exists a convex polyhedron with those given numbers of faces of each type (and an unspecified number of hexagonal faces) if and only if those numbers of polygons obey a linear equation derived from Euler's polyhedral formula. The theorem is named after Victor Eberhard, a blind German mathematician, who published it in 1888 in his habilitation thesis and in expanded form in an 1891 book on polyhedra. Definitions and statement For an arbitrary convex polyhedron, one can define numbers p_3, p_4, p_5, etc., where p_i counts the faces of the polyhedron that have exactly i sides. A three-dimensional convex polyhedron is defined to be simple when every vertex of the polyhedron is incident to exactly three edges. In a simple polygon, every vertex is incident to three angles of faces, and every edge is incident to two sides of faces. Since the numbers of angles and sides of the faces are given, one can calculate the three numbers v (the total number of vertices), e (the total number of edges), and f (the total number of faces), by summing over all faces and multiplying by an appropriate factor: :v = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\sum_i i\\\\,p_i, :e = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_i i\\\\,p_i, and :f=\\\\sum_i p_i. Plugging these values into Euler's polyhedral formula v-e+f=2 and clearing denominators leads to the equation :\\\\sum_i (6-i)p_i = 12, which must be satisfied by the face counts of every simple polyhedron. However, this equation is not affected by the value of p_6 (as its multiplier 6-i is zero), and, for some choices of the other face counts, changing p_6 can change whether or not a polyhedron with those face counts exists. That is, obeying this equation on the face counts is a necessary condition for the existence of a polyhedron, but not a sufficient condition, and a complete characterization of which face counts are realizable would need to take into account the value of p_6. Eberhard's theorem implies that the equation above is the only necessary condition that does not depend on p_6. It states that, if an assignment of numbers to p_3,p_4,p_5,p_7,\\\\dots (omitting p_6) obeys the equation :\\\\sum_i (6-i)p_i = 12, then there exists a value of p_6 and a simple convex polyhedron with exactly p_i i-sided faces for all i. Examples There are three simple Platonic solids, the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron. The tetrahedron has p_3=4, the cube has p_4=6, and the dodecahedron has p_5=12, with all other values of p_i being zero. These three assignments of numbers to p_i all obey the equation that Eberhard's theorem requires them to obey. The existence of these polyhedra shows that, for these three assignments of numbers to p_i, there exists a polyhedron with p_6=0. The case of the dodecahedron, with p_5=12 and all others except p_6 zero, describes more generally the fullerenes. There is no fullerene with p_6=1 but these graphs are realizable for any other value of p_6; see for instance, the 26-fullerene graph, with p_6=3. A hexagon bisects the cube into two copies of a simple polyhedron with one hexagonal face, three isosceles right triangle faces, and three irregular pentagonal faces. It is not possible to form a simple polyhedron using only three triangles and three pentagons, without the added hexagon. There is no simple convex polyhedron with three triangle faces, three pentagon faces, and no other faces. That is, it is impossible to have a simple convex polyhedron with p_3=p_5=3, and p_i=0 for i otin\\\\\\\\{3,5\\\\\\\\}. However, Eberhard's theorem states that it should be possible to form a simple polyhedron by adding some number of hexagons, and in this case one hexagon suffices: bisecting a cube on a regular hexagon passing through six of its faces produces two copies of a simple roofless polyhedron with three triangle faces, three pentagon faces, and one hexagon face. That is, setting p_6=1 suffices in this case to produce a realizable combination of face counts.For both the nonexistence of a polyhedron with three triangles, three pentagons, and no hexagons, and the existence with one hexagon, see , third row of Table 13.3.1, page 268. Related results An analogous result to Eberhard's theorem holds for the existence of polyhedra in which all vertices are incident to exactly four edges. In this case the equation derived from Euler's formula is not affected by the number p_4 of quadrilaterals, and for every assignment to the numbers of faces of other types that obeys this equation it is possible to choose a number of quadrilaterals that allows a 4-regular polyhedron to be realized. A strengthened version of Eberhard's theorem states that, under the same conditions as the original theorem, there exists a number m such that all choices of p_6 that are greater than equal to m and have the same parity as m are realizable by simple convex polyhedra. A theorem of David W. Barnette provides a lower bound on the number of hexagons that are needed, whenever the number of faces of order seven or higher is at least three. It states that, in these cases, :p_6\\\\ge 2+\\\\frac{p_3}{2}-\\\\frac{p_5}{2}-\\\\sum_{i>6} p_i. For polygons with few pentagons and many high-order faces, this inequality can force the number of hexagons to be arbitrarily large. More strongly, it can be used to find assignments to the numbers of faces for which the required number of hexagons cannot be bounded by any function of the maximum number of sides of a face. Analogues of Eberhard's theorem have also been studied for other systems of faces and face counts than simple convex polyhedra, for instance for toroidal graphs and for tessellations.

According to local folklore the father of Abraham Lincoln accepted a job at the Boone Distillery in 1814. Boone was a pioneer to the area. It was a time of sieges and skirmishes with local tribes. Boone would have been part of a group of settlers who travelled through the Cumberland Gap, at the time Samuel Goodwin, founded Goodin or Goodwin Fort, as a frontier settlement of Virginia. Following the American Revolutionary War more settlers arrived. By the time Kentucky established statehood over this area, Boone’s neighbor, Aaron Atherton and his son, Peter Atherton (1771-1844) had been operating a small distillery on the banks of Rolling Fork River at Knob Creek for over thirty years, since around 1790 making them also one of the first whiskey pioneers of Kentucky Legacy Boone is one of the likely candidates as to the person who invented bourbon; the other candidates being Evan Williams, or Boone’s partner, James Richie.

Family  Born in Wittenmoor, Alvensleben descended from the Old Markish noble family House of Alvensleben and was the eldest son of the landowner, Prussian chamberlain, member of the manor house and district deputy (1852-1923) on Wittenmoor, Sichau-Tarnefitz and Plutowo, and of Ida von Alvensleben, née von Glasenapp (1866–1924). His youngest brother was the officer Wichard von Alvensleben (1902-1982), who became known through the liberation of prominent SS hostages in late April 1945. His middle brother Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben was a SS and police leader in Italy. In 1944, Alvensleben married Elma Freiin zu (1919-2004) from the Bodelschwingh. This marriage produced three children, including the ambassador Busso von Alvensleben (b. 1949).  Education  In 1914, Alvensleben graduated from the Ritterakademie in . From the First World War, during which he was mainly deployed in Northern France and Flanders, he returned as a first lieutenant. From 1919, he studied agriculture and forestry, history, art history and philosophy in Munich. Besides he took drawing, etching and lithography lessons. Gutshaus Wittenmoor, Altmark In 1920, Alvensleben took over the management of the Wittenmoor estate and continued his studies in Berlin, which he expanded to include law, economics, diplomacy and archaeology. Diary entries show the man who was influenced by war experiences as an intellectual and spiritual seeker; in 1926 he visited Romain Rolland in Villeneuve on Lake Geneva. In 1926, he went to Hamburg and in 1927 he received his doctorate under the art historian Erwin Panofsky as Dr. phil.. His dissertation on the Großer Garten in Herrenhausen was published by Deutscher Kunstverlag and provided the inspiration for its reconstruction from 1936, in which he participated in an advisory capacity. This was followed by travels in Europe, especially repeatedly to France, which influenced him throughout his life in his preference for the Baroque, and world travels, which took him to America and Asia. In 1927/28, he travelled to India together with his cousin, the Indologist Helmuth von Glasenapp. During his stays in China and Japan in 1932/33, he was mainly interested in their philosophy and in the art of gardening in China and Japanese garden. Among his friends was Hans-Hasso von Veltheim-Ostrau, who endeavoured to bring Indian teachings to Germany.  Other activities  The reconstructed \\"Große Garten\\" in Herrenhausen Der rekonstruierte Park von Schloss Hundisburg Anco Wigboldus: Vogelschau auf Schloss Erxleben Like many of his ancestors, Alvensleben based his broad education on the idea that he would be involved in civil service. When the National Socialists came to power, he was forced to turn his attention to more private projects. Through his studies of palaces and gardens of the Baroque era, he became increasingly interested in his family's historical and cultural heritage. He also reconstructed the baroque park of the former Alvensleben on behalf of the owners. In 1937, he published a book about the architect of Hundisburg, Hermann Korb, and his Brunswick castle buildings. From 1935, he initiated the restoration of the . Extensive collections of written and photographic material were created. On Alvensleben's commission and on the basis of his preliminary work, the Dutch painter Anco Wigboldus drew all of Alvensleben's houses in the baroque style of bird's-eye view, after having visited them in his company and ascertained their condition in past centuries under his guidance. Park and Gutshaus Wittenmoor experienced a heyday in its development with numerous guests, lively spiritual exchange and a lot of music. In 1936, Alvensleben had to give up part of its forest areas for the construction of the and in 1937 acquired the Keez estate (part of Brüel) near Schwerin in Mecklenburg, which offered him an additional challenge both economically and in terms of design. During the Second World War, Alvensleben was a soldier in Poland, France, Russia, the Balkans, Italy and finally Norway. His diary during the war (excerpts published in 1971 under the title \\"Lauter Abschiede\\") reports on this. Together with the then Superintendent of Stendal Hermann Alberts, he saved the valuable medieval stained glass windows of the Stendal Cathedral by having them stored in the Wittenmoor manor house during the war.Article with portrait photo of Udo von Alvensleben on the website of the family von Alvensleben After the expropriation of his property by the so-called land reform in the Soviet-occupied zone in 1945, Alvensleben lived as a refugee in his wife's parents' house, Haus Bodelschwingh near Dortmund. He kept himself and his family afloat with lectures on cultural history and commissioned publications. Soon agricultural and forestry tasks were once again available when his wife inherited the neighbouring small estate of . Alvensleben belonged to committees of the forestry industry, the Swedish-German Refugee Aid and the Central German Cultural Council, organised conferences, advised on questions of the restoration of historical gardens and continued his intensive research work. His publications from this period include \\"Die Schloss LütetsburgLütetsburger] Chronicle\\", the history of the Frisian chief family Knyphausen, and \\"Alvenslebensche Burgen und Landsitze\\". He made a major contribution to the fact that the von Alvensleben family resumed their family reunions, which had begun in 1479, after the expulsion in 1945, the rescued parts of the Alvensleben fiefdom library from the 16th century were secured in their holdings and the legendary medieval family ring was given a place of safekeeping commensurate with its importance. After reunification, the ring was entrusted to the cathedral treasure in Halberstadt, the episcopal town closely associated with the family's origins. From 1914 to 1962, Alvensleben kept an extensive diary, which after 's death was compiled and edited in parts into castle books and a war diary. These are fascinating cultural-historical testimonies of strong personal expression and judgement. Alvensleben died in Bodelschwingh at the age of 65.

Wölk is best known for her paintings of romantic starscapes and a recycling of popular culture, science fiction imagery hinting at ideas of a cosmic “life beyond Earth”. Romanticism and utopia are key themes to her work and she is considered to be a part of the contemporary conceptual and figurative artists in Berlin.  Early life and education  Wölk was born in 1982 and raised in Jena, former East Germany. Jena was the center for optics technology and lasers in the former GDR, Germany. Deciding from the age of 15 that she wished to be a painter, her interest in space landscapes began with the Jena Planetarium and their cosmic shows of night sky simulations ,10]. Her work is now heavily informed by science fiction movies and books, such as Neuromancer (1984) by William Gibson which predicts an inhabitable cyberspace. Her grandfather encouraged her drawing from a young age which introduced her combination of West and East influences as her grandfather came from East-Prussian Königsberg, modern-day Kaliningrad. Being raised in a generation of divide encouraged Wölk to imagine alternate realities. Her imagined space realities are reminiscent of the dreaming of freedom experienced by members of her family in Germany. Wölk first received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Fine Arts Burg Giebichenstein Halle, Germany, in 2004. In 2006 she studied at Chelsea College of Fine Art and Design, London, UK, before returning to Germany. In 2007 she graduated from Weißensee Academy of Art Berlin, Germany with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. By 2009, Wölk was awarded a Master in Fine Arts from The Weißensee Academy of Art Berlin, Germany. Wölk’s career took a surprising kick-start at the age of 24 when her painting Dog Girl (2006) was purchased by Elgiz Museum and shown alongside well-established artists such as Cindy Sherman, Tracey Emin and Sarah Morris. Wölk is embedded in the contemporary art scene of Berlin, Germany while selling, exhibiting and working internationally.  Work  Wölk works primarily with oil paints while also employing mixed media with acrylics and aerosol. Her paintings are reminiscent of nocturnal landscapes and incorporate many visual features of science fiction films. Her work captures cinematic landscapes with visually multilayered narrations with a fantastical interpretation of nature. Her recognisable use of birch trees are informed by the Russian meaning for the tree as a symbol of virginal beauty which allows her to play with illusions and representations of reality. Her sense of space creates an illusion of infinity through a sense of space travel or life beyond Earth Wölk’s work is also strongly symbolic of the future of science and technology, using information from the advances of satellites and cameras. Her series Planet Spheres, 2019, are three-dimensional paintings made with acrylic paint and styrofoam. These works are clear representations of astronomical influence, mirroring the shape of globes, the 360 view invites an interaction of telescopic imagery. The most recent series Nebulae, 2020, are inspired by the aesthetic construction of gasses such as helium and hydrogen, combined to give birth to interstellar dust. The vastness of cosmic space in her work creates an unimaginable distance between human life and the possibility of “life beyond Earth”. While her series Starscapes, 2018-2010 really pushed for a visual reality of what extraterrestrial colonies could look like: a lifestyle of starry skies, LED lighting and cinematic embrace. Wölk’s works are inspired by the astronomical works of Russell Crotty, as seen in her work Second Earth, 2019 (40cm sphere, Acrylic on Styrofoam). The hyperrealism night sky drawings of Vija Celmins enters Wölk’s inspirational realm in making use of telescopic imagery of space. The delicate nocturnal landscapes of Aert van der Neer have informed Wölk’s use of light in a very traditional sense, as seen in her work The Multiverse, 2018 (50 x 70 cm, acrylic on canvas).  Career  Since 2009, Wölk has become well known for her works of colourful birch trees and science fiction landscapes. Her work is identifiable by her omnipresent use of indanthrone blue to produce the depth and mystery of space and time. She has been nominated for an array of awards and scholarships. Her awards include the national Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes scholarship and a See.me Category Award for the ArtPrize competition ‘Art Takes Paris’, judged by directors from The Andy Warhol Museum in New York, Lisson Gallery, and the Marianne Boesky Gallery. Wölk has been exhibiting in art fairs and private galleries alongside selling on the international market since the early 2000s, including Spain, Korea, Turkey, Austria and others. She has been a part of a handful of residencies, including the Tag und Nacht at Werkstatt Plettenberg 2008, the 2012 Bodensee Art Fund Residency, and the artist-in-residence grant in Goriska Brda, Slovenia awarded by the German Embassy, 2014. She has exhibited alongside other well known contemporary artists such as Robert Rasuchenberg, Johannes Wohnseifer, Azade Köker, and Stephan Balkenhol. Wölk is currently represented by 5 Pieces Gallery, Bern, Switzerland and Alfa Gallery, Miami, USA. She has been also professionally recognised through offering workshops, lectures, featuring in podcasts and coordinating education programmes. Since 2008 Wölk has been a senior teacher in the Painting Department at the Fine Art Faculty of Jugendkunstschule in Pankow, Berlin.  Solo exhibitions  2020 * Questions to Heaven.

He was officially credited with the destruction of nine enemy aircraft. Born in Otago in New Zealand, MacKenzie joined the RAF in 1937 on a short service commission. After completing his flight training, he was posted to No. 41 Squadron where he flew Hawker Furys and then Supermarine Spitfires. He flew several patrols covering the beaches at Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo and then fought in the Battle of Britain, during which he destroyed several German aircraft. He was later sent to Singapore to join No. 488 Squadron, raised to strengthen the aerial defences of British Malaya. The squadron flew extensively during the Japanese invasion of British Malaya but was eventually evacuated to Australia. Mackenzie then commanded No. 14 Squadron before returning to the United Kingdom in mid-1943. He transferred to the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1944, briefly commanded No. 64 Squadron, and finished the war in New Zealand. He later rejoined the RAF, serving in a number of training posts until his retirement from the military in 1957 with the rank of squadron leader. Returning to New Zealand, he ran an automotive dealership in Balclutha in his later years. He died in 1993. Early life John Noble MacKenzie was born on 11 August 1914 in Goodwood, in Otago, New Zealand. His grandfather was Thomas MacKenzie, a former prime minister of New Zealand. He was educated at Timaru Boys' High School before going on to Otago Boys' High School. After completing his schooling he went farming but in April 1937 sought a short service commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF). His application was accepted, and he left for the United Kingdom in October 1937. Training commenced at the Elementary Flying Training School at the RAF's station at Desford before going onto Uxbridge as an acting pilot officer. Further flight training followed at No. 9 Flying Training School at Hullavington and he earned his pilot's wings in June 1938. After advanced training was completed, in September 1939 he was posted to No. 41 Squadron, which was based at Catterick and operated Hawker Furys. In January the following year, it began to re-equip with the Supermarine Spitfire. Second World War When the Second World War broke out, MacKenzie's squadron had yet to finish converting to the Spitfire. For the early part of the war, it carried out covering operations for convoys and patrols along the East coast of England. In late May 1940, it began operating from Hornchurch, flying patrols over the beaches at Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo for a three-week period. During this time, MacKenzie flew several patrols but only ever sighted one enemy aircraft. At the end of its period of service at Hornchurch, the squadron went back to Catterick for a rest. =Battle of Britain= Pilots of No. 41 Squadron, December 1940. MacKenzie stands on the far left and in the centre is Squadron Leader Don Finlay, a former Olympic hurdler for Great Britain In late July, No. 41 Squadron returned to Hornchurch to assist No. 11 Group, now heavily engaged in the Battle of Britain. MacKenzie's first encounter with the Luftwaffe during the battle was on the morning of 29 July when his section encountered a formation of bombers escorted by fighters. He engaged one fighter but was attacked by another which damaged his Spitfire. With a smoke-filled cockpit and unable to bale out, he made a forced landing at Deal. In a later flight that day, he engaged a Dornier Do 17 bomber but return fire from its rear gunner damaged his aircraft and he made another forced landing. The squadron operated from Hornchurch until mid-August before it returned to Catterick. On 15 August, when the Luftwaffe mounted large scale daylight bombing raids against the United Kingdom, MacKenzie was leading a section of No. 41 Squadron when it encountered a large group of Junkers Ju 88 bombers near the Durham coast. Mackenzie claimed a Ju 88 as probably destroyed, seeing smoke coming from the starboard engine after his attack but being unable to verify it as definitely destroyed. In early September, and with MacKenzie having just been promoted to flying officer, the squadron went back to Hornchurch. He shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter over Canterbury on 6 September, having pursued it from above the Thames Estuary. He claimed another Bf 109 the same day as a probable. On 9 September, he shot down a Bf 109 and two days later claimed a Heinkel He 111; its crew made a forced landing in a field after MacKenzie shot up its port engine. Although he received sole credit for the He 111, MacKenzie believed that it had already been damaged in an earlier encounter with RAF fighters. He shared in the destruction of another bomber, a Do 17, on 15 September. A week later, while he and a colleague escorted an Avro Anson near Calais, they encountered a group of Bf 109s. MacKenzie shot down one, which crashed into the English Channel, and damaged another. He shot down a Bf 109 on 5 October and shared in the shooting down of a Dornier Do 215 two days later. Two more Bf 109s were damaged while on a patrol on 25 October. He ended the patrol running out of fuel and damaging his Spitfire when landing in a field near Redhill. At the end of the month he destroyed a Bf 109 over Marden. Although the Battle of Britain was now officially over, No. 41 Squadron continued to encounter enemy aircraft in its area of operations as the Luftwaffe resumed attacking convoys in the English Channel and Thames Estuary. MacKenzie destroyed a Bf 109 on 17 November 1940, tacking onto the end of a formation of three enemy fighters without them realising his presence until he opened fire. On 27 November his squadron encountered a group of ten Bf 109s, all of which were destroyed with MacKenzie accounting for one which crashed near Folkestone. This was to be his last confirmed victory. The same month, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC); the citation published in the London Gazette read: Promoted to acting flight lieutenant in January 1941, MacKenzie was now commanding one of the squadron's flights. The DFC he had been awarded the previous November was presented to him by King George VI in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in late February. Soon afterwards, having made a total of 245 operational flights, MacKenzie was taken off offensive operations and began flight control duties. His acting rank was made permanent later in the year. =Singapore= A flight of Brewster Buffaloes over British Malaya In September 1941, MacKenzie was posted to join the newly formed No. 488 Squadron, raised by the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in New Zealand and intended for service in Singapore. The squadron needed experienced leaders like MacKenzie to help bring it up to operational readiness as soon as possible. MacKenzie arrived in Singapore in October to join the squadron and take command of its \\"A\\" flight. The squadron was based at Kallang and began familiarisation with the Brewster Buffalo aircraft, which it had taken over from No. 67 Squadron. MacKenzie was heavily involved in the training of the squadron as its commander, Squadron Leader Wilfred Clouston, another Battle of Britain veteran, was occupied with the administrative duties. When the Japanese attacked British Malaya in December 1941, the squadron had yet to reach operational standards and intensified its training. By the end of the year it was flying regular patrols aimed at detecting and destroying Japanese reconnaissance aircraft but the Buffaloes were inadequate for the task, having a low operational ceiling. In the squadron's first major encounter with the enemy, an interception of a bombing raid, McKenzie's Buffalo was damaged by a Ki-27. Losses to Japanese fighters and bombing raids on Kallang soon reduced the squadron to only a few aircraft by the end of the month by which time MacKenzie was its commander. He had taken over the role when Clouston was posted to RAF Headquarters in Singapore. Despite reinforcement with some Hawker Hurricanes, the Japanese bombing of the squadron's airfield hampered operations. In fact, as a result of the bombing, he lost his hearing for a time. The squadron was shortly evacuated to Tjililitan airfield, in the Dutch East Indies, from where they flew covering patrols over Java until the Japanese advance prompted a further move to Fremantle in Australia on 23 February 1942. =Later war service= MacKenzie went on to New Zealand where in April he took command of the newly raised No. 14 Squadron, a unit of the RNZAF. He had been promoted to acting squadron leader the previous month. His new command was mostly made up of personnel who had served in Singapore and was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks after initially working up on North American Harvards. After four months at No. 14 Squadron, MacKenzie was posted to the Fighter Operational Conversion Unit which was based at Ohakea. He remained there until mid-1943 at which time he returned to the United Kingdom. Once there, he went to RAF Sutton Bridge to complete a course at the Central Gunnery School. He then took command of the gunnery and bombing squadron at No. 61 Fighter Operational Training Unit. In April 1944, MacKenzie was appointed commander of No. 64 Squadron, which operated Spitfires escorting bombings, attacking coastal shipping and flying patrols along the English coast. In September he was repatriated to New Zealand, having transferred to the RNZAF earlier in the year. He hoped to go on operations against the Japanese but in the event this did not eventuate and instead, after doing a conversion course on the F4U Corsair, he went back to Ohakea, but this time to the Fighter Leaders School. He remained there until August 1945 when he left the RNZAF. He was officially credited with the destruction of nine enemy aircraft, a share in another destroyed aircraft, three probably destroyed, and three damaged. Later life Returning to the United Kingdom in 1946, MacKenzie sought a return to the RAF. He was successful and resumed his service career that July as the commander of Air Fighting Development Squadron at RAF West Raynham. His commission was made permanent with the rank of squadron leader in September 1948. He was posted to Home Command at the Air Ministry where he served for two years. For medical reasons, he was unable to hold a flying post from July 1950. He served on the staff of the School of Land/Air Warfare at Old Sarum before taking up a post in Hong Kong. He then moved onto the headquarters of the Far East Air Force, based in Singapore. His final posting was back in the United Kingdom, at RAF Brampton, where he was on the research staff at the Technical Training Command for 18 months. He resigned from the RAF in October 1957. Returning to New Zealand, MacKenzie purchased an automotive dealership in Balcultha and operated this until 1972, at which time he retired. He died at Balcultha on 28 March 1993, survived by his wife and two children. A son had predeceased him.

It bears a certain resemblance to the extinct 19th-century game of Piquesept, however without the special rules associated with the trump Seven.  History and name  Herzblatt first appears in a German games compendium in 1966 and has been published sporadically since, both in print and online. Herzblatt is German for \\"sweetheart\\", which is probably a play on words, since Herzblatt could also mean \\"Heart card\\" or \\"hand of Hearts\\". Herz Sticht literally means \\"Heart stings\\" or, in card-play, \\"Hearts trump\\". The game is unrelated to the similar-sounding games of Herzla and Herzeln.  Rules  The following rules are based on Braun (1966) except where stated. The aim of the game for the soloist is to score 66 points by winning tricks. The defenders' aim is to thwart this. = Cards = The game uses a standard 32-card French-suited pack usually of the Berlin pattern. Cards rank in the usual Ace-Ten order and the suit of Hearts is always the trump suit, hence the name which means “heart card” or “heart hand”. = Players = Two to five players may play. If two play, however, the Sevens, Eights and Nines are removed and each player receives 9 cards; 2 remaining in the skat (Stock, Skat, Blinden, Talon). If three play, all the Sevens are removed along with the 8 and 8, and each player receives 8 cards; if four play, only the 8 and 8 are removed and each player receives 7 cards; if five play, the full 32 cards are used and each player gets 6 cards. In every case, a skat of 2 cards is placed face down in the middle of the table. = Play = After the cards have been dealt, each player is asked in turn whether he wishes to become the soloist and plays against the others. If he does, he can say \\"(I'll play)\\" (ich spiele). Once the soloist is decided, he picks up the skat, adds it to his hand and discards 2 cards which count towards his score at the end. Forehand now leads to the first trick. Suit must be followed; a player unable to follow suit, must trump; only if unable to do either may a player discard. If a trump is led, subsequent players must overtrump if able. = Scoring and settling = Players agree the stake to be played for at the start of the game. After the last trick has been taken, players tot up their points taken in tricks. If the soloist reaches 66 points (including any points in his two discards), he has won the deal. However, the sources describe different ways of settling the score. Braun and Lembke say that, if the soloist wins, he \\"takes the stake\\", but if he loses he pays double and, if he loses with 30 points or fewer, he is schneider and pays three times the stake. According to Feder, the soloist receives a single stake if he wins, but pays double if he loses. As a variant, he states that if the defenders score fewer than 33, they pay triple; if the soloist scores fewer than 33, he pays quadruple. Finally, Reichelt clarifies that, in the event of a win, the soloist receives a single stake from each opponent, but pays each one the stake if he loses. However, the penalty for losing with 33 or fewer points is more severe: the soloist pays quadruple to each defender; if the defenders lose with 33 or fewer, they each pay a triple stake to the soloist.

Waterpoort The Waterpoort (also known as Porta Regia, and Coninckxpoort) is a triumphal arch located in the Zuiderdokken, Zuid Antwerp. The monument was originally a water gate on the Scheldt river. When this arch was originally built on the Scheldt, it functioned as a passage to the river from the fortified wall that protected the city of Antwerp. Boats could get to the Vlasmarkt from the Scheldt side through this passage. The gate was built by Hubert van den Eynde, with the help of Hans van Mildert as a honorary gate for king Philip IV. Inscriptions on both sides of the gate indicate its function as both a waterpoort and an honorary arch to Philip IV. The arch was erected in 1624. The design of the gate has been attributed to Peter Paul Rubens, although, as opposed to the identity of the sculptors, there is no documentary evidence of Rubens' involvement. The arch was originally built as a water gate and an entrance to the Vlasmarkt. Following works on the Scheldt quays, the gate was moved to the Sint-Jansvliet in the 1880s. When, in 1933, the entrance building of the new Sint-Anna pedestrian tunnel had to be built in that location, the gate was moved again. In 1936 it was eventually rebuilt on the Gillisplaats in the Zuid, on the Zuiderdokken. Because it was moved twice, the arch is nicknamed 'the walking gate'.

Morris Carstairs was appointed a senior registrar at Maudsley Hospital, London, in 1953; in 1961 he took a chair of psychological medicine at the University of Edinburgh. The couple had three children. The marriage broke down, ending in divorce. Morris Carstairs later married the academic Nancy Shields Hardin. Career Vera Carstairs was employed as a Principal Research Officer for the Scottish Home and Health Department from 1966 to 1975. In later years she was associated with Edinburgh University Medical School, and acted as Scottish health services research network coordinator. She was chairperson of the Society for Social Medicine and Population Health in 1982, and is on their list of honorary members. In 1995 she was awarded an honourary degree as Doctor of Medicine by the University of Edinburgh. She was also a member of the Social Research Association. Work on deprivation In 1981, shortly after a paper Multiple deprivation and health state, Carstairs published a paper on small area analysis in the health context. In 1986 with Lowe she published a further paper on small area analysis. She went on, in work with Russell Morris, to research health in Scotland by postcode sector, leading to a book Deprivation and Heath in Scotland (1990). At the time of their 1989 joint paper on deprivation, Carstairs was an honorary fellow at The Usher Institute in Edinburgh, where Morris was a research officer. The paper looked at the standardized mortality ratio and excess mortality in areas of Scotland, and then adjusted for area-based deprivation factors. The Carstairs Deprivation Index, as it is now known, was developed at this period, by substituting in the Townsend index for a factor making allowance for not being a home owner. It was replaced by a variable standing for lower social class. It has been used for surveys on birth weight and health outcomes. As framed in 1991 by Carstairs and Morris, it deals with \\"goods and services, resources and amenities and of a physical environment which are customary in society\\", a measure of deprivation being a reflection of difficulty of access to those. Scores reflect a \\"summary measure of relative disadvantage between populations contained within small geographic localities.\\" Other works In the series of Scottish Health Service Studies, Carstairs was author of: *Study #1, Patients under Psychiatric Care in Hospital: Scotland 1963 (1966), with Alwyn Smith *Study #2, Home Nursing in Scotland: Report of an Enquiry into Local Authority Domiciliary Services (1966) *Study #11, Channels of Communication (1970). By 1966, Carstairs at work in Scottish hospitals had recognised communication as a problem. *Study #19, The Elderly in Residential Care (1971) of care models for the elderly, with Marion Morrison. The authors argued that two-thirds of those at that time in care homes could be in sheltered housing. *Study #42, Services for the Elderly (1982), with John Bond. Carstairs was co- author, with T. Abelin and Z. J. Brzezinski, of the WHO handbook Measurement in Health Promotion and Protection (1987). This work was a joint publication of the WHO and IEA, and a sequel to Measurement of Levels of Health (1979) by Walter W. Holland, J. Ipsen, and J. Kostrzewski, intended to complement its coverage of disease with material on health.

First Indian to secure a D.Sc (Doctor of Science) degree, he later became the first principal of Nizam College, Hyderabad. The renowned poet and Indian political activist Sarojini Naidu was his eldest daughter.  Biography  = Early Years = Aghorenath was born in Bhrahmongaon, Bikrampur (then in Bengal Presidency now in Bangladesh). After completing his initial education in Dhaka Collegiate School, he spent three and a half years in Presidency College, Kolkata before moving to University of Edinburgh on Gilchrist Scholarship for higher studies. He excelled in his studies and secured the Hope Prize and Baxter Scholarship. = Career and Politics = Nizam College at present Upon his return to India, he accepted the invitation from Nizam of Hyderabad State to modernise the education system there. He began with an English medium school. With Nizam's support he founded the Hyderabad College with himself its first principal which later became the Nizam College. Later he also initiated efforts to start a College for Women as a part of Osmania University. He was instrumental in implementing the Special Marriage Act 1872 in the Hyderabad State, which was already in vogue in British India. Aghorenath was a prominent member of the intellectuals' collective of Hyderabad who debated on social political and literary topics. Around this time Aghorenath also got involved in politics. He had differences of opinion with the Nizam on the Chanda Rail Project and a displeased Nizam suspended him from his job and deported him out of Hyderabad on 20th May 1883. However a few years later he was recalled and reinstated. In fact it was Nizam who later provided a scholarship for Sarojini to pursue her studies in England,. Back in Hyderabad Aghorenath continued his political activism and hence was forced to retire early and relocate to Kolkata.

The couple had 8 children four girls and four boys. Sarojini was the eldest.Sarojini Naidu describes her father as a dreamer and an intellectual with unending curiosity. It was this curiosity that turned him into an alchemist in search of a recipe for gold. After she published her firs collection of poems \\"Golden Threshold\\", the house where the family stayed in Hyderabad came to be called Golden Threshold. This is currently a museum . Second daughter Mrinalini completed her studies from Cambridge and later became the principal of Gangaram Girls' High School, Lahore, which is now known as Lahore College for Women University .

In 1865 it became a machine factory. In 1909 it started to build ships and in 1927 it branched out to the aircraft industry.  Predecessors  Burgerhout was preceded by the smithies of Kramer and Steigerwald. In 1772 Jan Kramer, smith and 'maker of spits' was mentioned in the Zwanesteeg at Leuvehaven Rotterdam. On 10 February 1818, smith Jan Kramer died at age 83. His daughter Cornelia Kramer, widow of J.H. Steigerwald then announced that her son J. Steigerwald would continue the business. On 22 January 1848 Jan Steigerwald died. His obituary held a note that the affairs would be provisionally continued 'in light of the size of the business inside and outside of the city'. In February 1848 there was an agreement that S. Bouwmeester and O. Grunzig would continue the company under the name ('firma') J. Steigerwald. At the time it produced anchors and made products for shipping, mills, households and carriages. It also repaired and build all kinds of steam engines. Smith Samuel Bouwmeester and steam engine manufacturer Otto Grunzig then made an association by contract to regulate their affairs The idea was not successful, and so the society between Bouwmeester and Grunzig was ended by 31 July 1849, with Bouwmeester handling the remaining business.  Foundation  In September 1852 Hendrik Adolph Burgerhout (1825-1913) took over Bouwmeester's smithy in the Zwanensteeg at Leuvehaven, Rotterdam. Burgerhout announced that he would continue the business under his own name, and that it still made household, shipping and mill work. It also made hearths, stoves, ship- and household kitchen stoves, and safes. It is likely that the less than successful takeover by Bouwmeester and Grunzig set back the company. The fact that Burgerhout's advertisement did not mention work on steam engines might be related to such a setback. Burgerhout would prove more successful. By 1853 he was recruiting skilled workers. In 1855 he won a tender for making galvanized iron roofs over 8 gunboats in Hellevoetsluis naval base at 7,669 guilders. In 1858 Burgerhout won a tender for the iron part of a bridge over the Rotte for 10,097 guilders. The bridge was 30 m long and 7 m wide. In spite of these successes the company continued to be a large smithy. It might work on steam boilers, and do repair work, but in 1857 it was not classified as a machine factory like Fijenoord, Christie & Zoon and Van Everdingen, Everard & Co. were.  Machine factory Burgerhout & Kraak (1865–1877)  On 1 November 1865 Hendrik Adolph Burgerhout and Arie Kraak founded the company (Dutch: Vennootschap) Burgerhout & Kraak. Its goal was the construction and repair of (iron) ships, steam engines, boilers, iron bridges, and other big iron constructions. The association would last at least till 31 December 1877. = Bridges = Burgerhout & Kraak continued to attract orders for bridges and other large constructions. In February 1866 it won a tender for an iron swing bridge near the Witte Leeuw for 5,394 guilders. In January 1867 the company won a bid for renewal of the Leuvebrug for 22,533 guilders. It consisted of a fixed iron part and an iron swing bridge. In 1869 Burgerhout & Kraak got the assignment to repair the 'Nieuwe Leuvebrug', which included a lock. = Steam engines for river navigation = The machinefactory of Burgerhout & Kraak was on Leuvehaven. In 1869 the factory of Burgerhout & Kraak was mentioned as being on the Houtlaan (Hout street). The Houtlaan was south of the Zalmhaven, i.e. the front door of the shipyards on the Zalmhaven was at the Houtlaan. In 1870 a big fire at Zalmhaven almost reached the 'Machinefactory de Maas' of Burgerhout & Kraak. Indeed Zalmkade No 10 was next to their 'Grofsmederij'. Burgerhout & Kraak seems to have specialized in small steam engines for river vessels. One of its first engines was one of 10 hp with a 16 hp boiler. The company repeatedly advertised it in 1866. This machine probably evolved to a proper engine of 16 hp. In October 1869 the company had the order to build the 16 hp machines for the iron river ship Maria en Johanna, under construction at Fop Smit. After that Burgerhout & Kraak was repeatedly mentioned as building 16 hp engines for ships.  Machine factory Burgerhout & Son (1878-1909)  = The Burgerhout's sole proprietors again = In January 1878 H.A. Burgerhout made a contract with his son Jan Burgerhout (1852-1900) to continue the activities of Burgerhout & Kraak as the company Burgerhout & Son (Dutch: Burgerhout en Zoon). By the end of the 1880's Burgerhout was a major employer in Rotterdam. In December 1889 70 employees of Burgerhout did not turn up because of a strike. = Continues to expand in river navigation = Burgerhout continued to specialize in machines and boilers for river navigation. In time it outgrew the very basic small steam engines it made. In 1882 it got order for a machine of 30 hp. In 1893 Burgerhout build two compound machines of together 80 hp for Dieu Donne V. In 1894 it built the engines of the steamtug Loreley I and the passenger liner Reserve III for the Maas and IJssel Line in Rotterdam. Burgerhout now grew from a simple constructor (copier) of steam engines to a company capable of designing engines and even ships. In 1901 Burgerhout was involved in the design of the Johann Knipscheer XV. It was a river paddle steamer of 10 m long, 18.60 m wide, a draft of only 1.07 m and 800 hp engines. As regard construction Burgerhout only built the boilers for this vessel. Burgerhout was also involved with the double screw river steamer Max Honsell, of 82.9 m length. = Tugboat service = In the 1880s Burgerhout & Son also ran a tugboat service. From 1885-1887 the tugs Burgerhout, Burgerhout II and Burgerhout III were noted on the Rhine, and these were not all of the ships of Burgerhout's tug service. Burgerhout's tugboat service had of course always used Burgerhout engines. The vessels themselves however, had been built by others. E.g. in 1907 a steel tugboat was launched for Burgerhout at the shipyard of H. van Vlaardingen in Gouda. While in the same year Boele in Slikkerveer was constructing Wacht am Rhein III for Burgerhout.  Burgerhout Shipyard and Machinefactory  = New shipyard at Varkenoord = By 1909 a new very advanced shipyard was under construction for Burgerhout at Varkenoord (somewhat upstream from Fijenoord on the southern shore of the Meuse). The advanced character came from a combination of innovations. It was a parallel slipway instead of a perpendicular slipway. It was made of 21 concrete short patent slips built like aqueducts. The whole was supported by 1,700 piles. The most visible parts were 2 kilometers of rails and a kilometer of chains, all used to move the 21 carriages by which a ship was pulled out of the water. Every 'slip' had a winch that could pull 12.5 ton. Four 25 hp electro engines drove the winches via an axle that run along the slip. The new slipway could handle a ship of up to 120 m long, but the idea was to simultaneously handle two Rhine ships or six tugboats. More capacity was available by shoving a ship from the carriages to some blocks. A ship could be taken out of the water in about 30 minutes. One of the unique advantages of the slipway was that it was far safer in handling very weak ships (like sand barges). The traditional perpendicular patent slip puts great strain on the hull when part of the ship is out of the water, and part of it is still floating on the water. With the spectacular increase in the length and beam, but not in the draft of river vessels, these became ever weaker. In a few years the whole company was moved to the new location. = Public Company = In 1910 Burgerhout became a public company. The capital was 500,000 guilders divided in 500 shares, 300 of them placed. The official name became Burgerhout's Machinefabriek en Scheepswerf. The first CEO was H.A. Burgerhout jr. The change to a public company might also have been related to ensuring the continuity of the company. H.A. Burgerhout junior died on 2 January 1911 at age 49. On 10 January 1911 his widow M.W. Burgerhout-Molenaar and his eldest son H.A. Burgerhout (1886-1932) became executive officers, while Hugo Burgerhout became vice president.H.A. Burgerhout studied at ETH Zurich = Further expansion = By 31 December 1909 Burgerhout had 9 tugboats under construction, 8 for German customers, and one for an English customer. The tug for the English customer was Kurt van Andreae, 35.5 m by 6.25 m with a 2.7 m hold. The machinery was a vertical tripple expansion engine of 525 ihp. Kurt van Andreae was the first ship completely built by Burgerhout. Despite these big investments Burgerhout seems to have stuck to its niche market: tugboats and specialty vessels. On 31 December 1911 Burgerhout had 5 tugboats under construction. On 31 December 1912 it had a sea tugboat under construction, as well as a number of pontoons for South America and other vessels. Among the vessels that Burgerhout had under construction on 31 December 1913 was a cargo steam boat of (436 GRT). = World War I = World War I was a bonanza for the Dutch shipbuilding industry and a lot of other industries. For Burgerhout, this was not immediately the case, because transport on the Rhine was severely affected by the war. Burgerhout thus had to shift to building seaworthy ships, but this was easier said than done. In 1915 Burgerhout launched only two tugboats and two ocean-going tugs The turning point came in 1916, when Burgerhout launched the steam freighters Boekelo, Amstel, Loosdrecht and Eva of 1,700 - 3,000 GRT. In 1917 Burgerhout launched four comparable steam freighters. In 1918 Burgerhout slowed down like the rest of the industry and only launched two steamtrawlers and a sea tug. Apart from building ocean going ships, Burgerhout was also involved in designing them. It furthermore built a lot of steam engines for other shipyards. The number of employees rose from 80 in 1910 to about 1,000 in 1921.  Post war glory years  = Post war boom and bust = After World War I most companies believed in a bright future. In the shipping industry they also had a lot of cash to invest. By the end of 1918 Burgerhout had 8 freighters from 1,200-6,250 GRT under construction. Four ships of 6,250 GRT were for the shipping line Solleveld, Van der Meer en Van Hattum's Stoomvaart-Maatschappij, which even participated in Burgerhout's capital to ensure it would get enough ships. Meanwhile Burgerhout took a loan of 1,000,000 guilders at 7% in mid 1920 For shipping the international bust started about January 1921, when freight prices dropped so low that they were no longer profitable for most shipping lines. Scheepvaart Maatschappij Oranje Nassau then cancelled Graaf Jan (2,500 GRT), on order at Burgerhout. Burgerhout then sold it to Australia as SS Poolta for half the original price. Together with Lingedijk (6,750 GRT) for Solleveld, this was all Burgerhout launched in 1921. Two more 6,750 GRT ships for Solleveld, a 2,750 GRT motor ship for Van Ommeren and two tugs remained 'on the ways'. In 1924 Burgerhout had a serious lack of orders. = Burgerhout Nobel diesel engine = In 1918 the Nobel family established the Nobel-Diesel company in Nynäshamn, Sweden. By 1921 it had built a 1,600 hp four cylinder two-stroke direct reversible Diesel engine. It had a fuel efficiency of over 80%, better than any other two-stroke engine. Many factories bought a license for this engine. E.g. Mirrlees, Bickerton and Dayin the United Kingdom, Nydqvist and Holm in Trollhättan, Niigata Diesel, and Burgerhout. Nobel-Diesel itself closed down in 1925. In November 1924 Burgerhout became the first Rotterdam firm to reveal a Diesel engine. It was a four cylinder two-stroke reversible engine of 900 ehp at 94 turns a minute. The maximum number of turns was 105 a minute. Notable features where the accessibility of the moving parts, the relatively light construction of these and the smooth operation of the engine. Fuel consumption was about 185 grams per axle-hp per hour. In 1926 Burgerhout sold its first diesel engine for the English Black Sea which was re-engineered to diesel propulsion. While Burgerhout sold quite some Burgerhout-Nobel diesel engines, it took a license to produce Werkspoor diesel engines in 1930. = Floating drydocks and engineering = On 3 December 1921 Burgerhout received the order for Tanjung Priok Dock of 8,000 tons. It was a floating dry dock for the Port of Tanjung Priok near Jakarta (then Batavia). She was finished in June 1923. That same month Burgerhout got an order for a 4,500 tons floating drydock for the harbor of Valparaíso in Chile. This was finished in May 1924. = Doors for the IJmuiden lock = A project related to dock construction was the construction of the lock doors for the new lock in the North Sea Canal. The new lock (now called north lock) was to be the biggest in the world, measuring 400 * 50 * 15 m, and to be completed in 1929. The three doors of the lock were 53.5 m wide, 20 m high and 8.4 m thick. In January 1925 Burgerhout won the order for three doors and a 'closing pontoon' for 310,000 per door, at a total price of 995,000 guilders. The work on these doors would last three years. On 29 January 1929 the first 1,200 ton lock door was christened by Mrs. van de Vegte-Visser wife of the minister for Waterstaat. After launch the door was tugged downstream. The trip to IJmuiden was an event that attracted a lot of attention. The tugs Drente (1,300 hp), Brabant (1,200 hp) and Vlaanderen of Wijsmuller would bring the door to open sea. With a beam of 20 m and a draft of 6 m, it proved unexpectedly difficult to tug the door. At one time the tide even pushed it back upstream. Therefore the commander decided to keep Vlaanderen involved in the transport to IJmuiden, and called in Nestor and Stentor from there. The tow then progressed along the coast at only three knots an hour. Near IJmuiden the convoy was joined by Hector and Junior, and finally it was moored in a canal to await the further completion of the lock. In late May the first door was placed in the lock. On 14 July 1927 the second door was launched. On 5 June 1928 the third door was launched by Burgerhout. = Destroyers = Destroyer Evertsen In late 1924 and early 1925 Burgerhout won a tender for three Admiralen-class destroyers, Evertsen, Kortenaer and Piet Hein. Winning the tender, and making a very successful delivery was a remarkable accomplishment for a company so new to shipbuilding. While a destroyer was much smaller than a regular freighter, it had engines that were in the order of magnitude of ten times more powerful. A shipyard really had to know its business in order to get everything right, and in this respect Burgerhout proved its ability. On 15 August 1928 Burgerhout laid down the destroyers Banckert and Van Nes of the same class. = Shipbuilding recovers = In 1926 Burgerhout launched only the destroyer Evertsen and some small barges, even though it had a lot of work in progress. In 1927 Burgerhout launched the destroyers Piet Hein and Kortenaer, the drydock of 3,000 tons for the navy, and two lock doors for IJmuiden, It also built two triple expansion machines of 240 hp. Which left on the ways and on order: three destroyers, one lock door, five hopper bargers, a motor tanker of 7,000 GRT and one of 10,000 GRT. Over the book year 1927 Burgerhout paid a dividend of 6%. In 1928-1929 many shipyards somewhat recovered, but for Burgerhout the financial results were not good. In 1928 Burgerhout delivered three destroyers and laid down two others. It also delivered the navy drydock, and launched MS Alexandre Andre of 7,000 GRT, 5 hopper barges and one lock door. Profit over 1928 was 33,517 guilders. On 1 January 1929 Burgerhout had only 1 motor tanker and two destroyers, as well as two Burgerhout-Nobel engines and four steam turbines in progress. The leadership predicted a bad year for the company. Meanwhile Burgerhout had bought adjacent terrains, and invested in renovation and enlargement of the slipways In 1929 Burgerhout launched the small MS Tidore for KPM. It delivered MS Belgian Gulf of 10,000 GRT. Near the end of 1929 Burgerhout got an order for a 2,600 GRT motor tanker for Anglo-Saxon Petroleum. As predicted the financial result over 1929 was bad, with a profit of only 2,561 guilders.  Aircraft  = Hosts precursor of Koolhoven = Hendrik Adolph Burgerhout (1886-1932) was twice involved with the aircraft industry. By March 1922 the company NV Nationale Vliegtuig Industrie (NVI) of Mr. Carley was temporarily housed on the shipyard. It was incorporated somewhat later. On 15 December 1922 a fire significantly damaged the aircraft production facilities and some other parts of the shipyard. Nationale Vliegtuig Industrie then bought a new factory building in The Hague. = Burgerhout founds Aviolanda = In 1927 Maatschappij voor Vliegtuigbouw Aviolanda NV was founded by H.A. Burgerhout and Shipyard Gebroeders Pot in Bolnes. It acquired the lease for the terrain of Shipyard vh de Weduwe A. v. Duyvendijk in Papendrecht. All this suggests that H.A. Burgerhout was primarily involved as a private person, but in fact the shipyard had previously acquired machinery and staff to produce aircraft. The first order for the new company was the construction of 18 Dornier Do J 'Wal' flying boats. The order would give employment to 100-150 people. The order for the Dornier 'Wal' was followed by others, and when Burgerhout Shipyard was discontinued, the separate company Aviolanda survived. After World War II is was merged into Fokker.  The end  = Increasing losses = The disappointing year 1929 saw the start of the Great Depression in October. In early 1930 Burgerhout still got an order to build a motor tanker of 11,500 GRT for Anglo-Saxon Petroleum. What was remarkable was that it would license build her Werkspoor engine as well as those of a number of English motor tankers ordered at the same time. In 1930 the work in progress continued to decline, with only the 11,500 GRT motor tanker, four Burgerhout-Werkspoor engines, a steam engine, another engine and 5 boilers in progress on 31 December 1930. By then the company still employed 1,100 people. In light of the inability to get profitable orders, the supervisory board announced that a reorganization with participation by the shareholders and bondholders was necessary. In 1931 Burgerhout's business did not improve. The work in progress was valued at 1,345,890 guilders at the start of the year. This was totally inadequate to generate enough revenue to pay for cost and deprecation which had been 1,294,361 in the previous year. In December 1931 it became known that Burgerhout and P. Vervat would step down as executive officers, and be replaced by H.Adolph Burgerhout of Aviolanda aircraft factory. On 2 January 1932 H.A. Burgerhout died. = Activities ceased = In January 1932 the new executive decided on an immediate cessation of the activities of the company. On 26 May 1932 the owners of the 7% bonds agreed to a cessation of the payment of interest and payback. The idea was that payment of interest would lead to a forced sale of the shipyard for a very low price. By stopping further losses, the assets (the modern shipyard) would turn in a profit once the economy improved. = Liquidation = Up till 1936 there was no serious interest to buy a shipyard. When the situation slightly recovered the parallel slipway was sold for 100,000 guilders in 1936. This sale was probably only completed in January 1937. The neighbouring shipyard P. Smit Jr. then bought the parallel slipway, the offices, the power station and the machine factory after lengthy negotiations. Shipyard P. Smit Jr. moved part of her business to the machinefactory hall of Burgerhout. The hall was renovated, and part of the old machinery was sold. Smit would use the machine factory hall to build Burmeister & Wain engines. = HuMaBu = Only a few days after the sale of to P. Smit Jr. the rest of the terrain was sold to the new company HuMaBu on 14 January 1937. It meant that the core of a shipyard capable of building new ships was left intact. Therefore a restart of the shipyard was possible and even expected. However, on 15 April HuMaBu sold the slipways and overhead cranes to P. Smit Jr. The reason that that Smit bought the slipways was that it thought it highly undesirable that a new shipyard would be established next to hers. HuMaBu then had only the boiler factory, an office and a large stretch of land left. HuMaBU itself was liquidated in 1939.

He made 14 appearances for them and was Kiwi number 183. He also played several times for Auckland and represented the Ponsonby United club from 1922 to 1929. Early life and family Hector Stanley Esmond Cole was born on February 12, 1902. He was the son of Catherine and John Cole. Hector was the middle child of seven. He had 3 older brothers, Reginald John Edward (b.1896), Albert James Merrick (b.1898), and Horace Gordon Clifford (b.1900), a younger sister Esma Mary Elizabeth (b.1907), and two younger brothers Roy Ernest Kitchener (b.1910), and Cecil Edwin Horatio (b.1913). Playing career =Ponsonby United debut and early career= Hector Cole began playing for the Ponsonby United senior side in the Auckland Rugby League competition in 1922. His older brother by 6 years, Reginald, was honorary secretary of the Ponsonby club in 1921-23 and for many years after was involved in their administration. He was still on the club committee into the early 1930s. Hector Cole's debut came on April 22 against Newton Rangers in a 15-10, round 1 win on Carlaw Park which had opened the previous season. He played in the first five position throughout the season. His only try came in a 41-20 thrashing of Newton in the Roope Rooster semi-final after he took a pass from Thomas McClymont and pushed his way through. He was also part of the side which won their third Roope Rooster end of season knockout title when they defeated Athletic in the final 11-10. In 1923 he played 14 matches for Ponsonby who once again won the Roope Rooster competition with a 14-3 win over City Rovers in front of 7,000 spectators. During this season he played in an inaugural 7-aside tournament on a Wednesday night under electric lights. It was the first time football matches had been played under lights possibly in New Zealand, with 3,000 spectators attending. During the evening sprint races were held with Cole taking part. He won his heat by seven yards in a time of 11.25 seconds, while New Zealand Olympic sprinter George Davidson who was playing for City Rovers won heat 2 in a time of 11.15 seconds. Davidson had come fifth in the 200m final at the Antwerp Olympics in Berlin 3 years earlier. The following season he played 7 matches for Ponsonby though he spent the middle portion of the season not named in the squad or else only in the reserves. He did however play in the Probables v Possibles trial match which was played as curtain-raiser to the third Auckland v Australian University match on June 14. His final match of the season was in the Roope Rooster final once again however this time his Ponsonby team was on the losing end on a 5-6 result to City Rovers. =Representative debut= The 1925 season saw Cole make his representative debut. He had been in rare try scoring form with 5 tries for Ponsonby in 7 matches. In a match with Richmond he scored two tries which were described in the New Zealand Herald: \\"Cole, beating several men, scored behind the posts\\" and \\"Cole scored next for Ponsonby, after beating several opponents with clever side-stepping\\". He was then picked in an Auckland trial side. The trial was played on June 27 as a curtain-raiser to the North Island v South Island match while an Auckland side also took on South Auckland (Waikato). He played in the five-eighths position alongside Roy Hardgrave in a 0-5 loss to the B team. Just five days later Cole made his full Auckland debut in a match against the New Zealand team which had been selected to tour Australia. He was again partnered with Hardgrave with Auckland going down 6-19 to the national side at Carlaw Park. He played 3 more championship matches for Ponsonby who were to finish runners-up to City Rovers. Cole was then selected for Auckland to play South Auckland (Waikato) in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup. The match was played in front of 3,000 spectators at Carlaw Park and saw Cole set up 3 tries in a 24-16 win. The first saw him start a movement leading to an Ivan Littlewood try in the corner, the second saw him again combine with Littlewood who scored again, while the third saw him put away by Clarrie Polson and he beat \\"several opponents\\" before passing to George Gardiner who scored. Cole's next match was the Roope Rooster final which saw Ponsonby defeat City 10-5 to win their 4th Roope Rooster title. Cole then played for Auckland once again against the returning New Zealand team back from their Australian tour. Auckland went down heavily in front of 15,000 spectators with Cole again playing five-eight in a 17-41 loss. Cole was chosen in the New Zealand squad to play the first match against the touring Queensland side but was named in the reserves and did not take the field. He was then chosen for the Auckland B southern tour. They played West Coast in Greymouth and won 22-15 with Cole scoring twice and converting a try, he then played in a 5-6 loss to Canterbury at Monica Park in Christchurch before the final match against Wellington at Newtown Park which saw Auckland B win 68-9. Three days later, on September 19 he played for Auckland against South Auckland with Riley playing with him in the five eighths positions and Frank Delgrosso at halfback. Both players were Ponsonby team mates of Cole. Auckland won easily 36-19 to retain the Northern Union Challenge Cup. He finished the season by playing for Ponsonby in a 23-22 Stormont Shield semi-final win over Marist Old Boys and then the 35-3 Stormont Shield final win over City Rovers. This was the first ever time that the Stormont Shield had been competed for. It was a memorial trophy named after the New Zealand international, and Marist player Bill Stormont who had passed away 3 months early from rheumatic heart disease aged just 26. =New Zealand selection and English Tour= Cole played 7 matches for Ponsonby to begin the 1926 season before gaining selection for Auckland to play South Auckland (Waikato) on June 26. The match was intended as a trial match to see the form of the local players with a view to the selection of the New Zealand team to tour England and Wales later in the season. Auckland won 49-15 with the match so one-sided that at halftime and Auckland leading 33-3 they loaned several players to the Waikato side. Cole played brilliantly at five eighth making many breaks and according to the The New Zealand Herald \\"was always in the thick of attacking movements. He was the best back\\". A week later he was picked to play for the North Island in the inter-island match with the South Island. The North Island won 31-22 in front of an enormous crowd of 18,000 at Carlaw Park. Cole played magnificently, scoring 2 tries. This performance ultimately sealed his place in the New Zealand touring side. He played alongside Jack Kirwan and Tim Peckham in the halves. Cole's first try came after he went through from halfway and with the fullback Bert Eckhoff out of position ran in for a try. Then Peckham in a \\"scissors\\" move with Cole sent him over for his second try. He was also involved in tries to Ivan Littlewood and Ben Davidson. During the second half he received a bad nose injury and was forced from the field. Cole was then selected in the backs as part of the 26 man touring side for the 1926-27 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain. The tour would ultimately be regarded as a disaster from a New Zealand stand point. There were several disputes with management and 7 players went on strike. They refused to play under the leadership of manager Ernest Mair and were later banned for life, while the tour record of 17 wins and 17 losses was underwhelming. Cole played in 15 matches including the first of the tour against Dewsbury which saw New Zealand win 13-9 in front of 16,000 spectators at Harrogate on September 11. Critics declared that Cole was \\"excellent\\" and his performance was reliable with his \\"straight running proving a constant source of worry to the Dewsbury men\\". He was selected to play the third tour match against Halifax but was ruled out through an injury to his knee. He next appeared against Rochdale Hornets in an 11-9 win where he was said to have made \\"some strong runs and his tackling was a thorn in the side of the Rochdale forces\\". Cole played five-eight once again in a 19-16 defeat of Barrow in front of 5,500 spectators. Cole registered his only try of the tour against Widnes on September 29. He scored New Zealand’s first try in a 15-5 win with 6,000 fans looking on. Cole was then in the side which went down 17-5 to Warrington in atrocious conditions, though in this match he had been moved into the centres alongside Hec Brisbane. New Zealand's performance in a cabled report from London was described as \\"third rate\\" and Cole along with Stan Webb were said to be \\"negligible in defence and ineffective in attack\\". It was 11 days until Cole would play again on Wednesday, October 20. It was in a 38-17 thrashing of Bradford Northern in front of 4,500 spectators. He made a \\"beautiful run, side-stepping several men, but was grassed just on the line\\" early in the match. Then early in the second half with New Zealand in trouble he intercepted a pass and ran to the Bradford 25m line before passing to Hec Brisbane who, \\"beating all opposition, ran over for the finest try of the day\\". Cole sustained a leg injury later in the match and had to go to the fullback position, switching with Craddock Dufty. Cole then played at five-eight against Leeds a week later, and he was paired with Wilson Hall who played halfback. Cole was said to have kicked \\"judiciously, and often penetrated the Leeds defence by his brilliant straight running\\". He was moved back to the centres for a 14-28 loss to St Helens Recreation on October 30 and played there again in an 18-10 win over Salford 4 days later. On November 13, Cole made his test debut when he came in as a last minute injury replacement in the second test against England at the famous Boulevard Ground in Hull. New Zealand went down 21-11 in a match played in heavy first half rain before it cleared for the second half. Ben Davidson had sustained an ankle injury \\"a week or two previously\\" and did not recover in time to take his place in the starting line up so Cole joined the back-line in the centres. Cole was partnered with Jack Kirwan and the two of them were said to be \\"putting in some great work on attack, and England's inside backs, brilliant as they undoubtedly were, were sorely tried\\". They two of them combined to beat \\"all opposition\\" before Kirwan handed on to Lou Brown who scored to make it 11-13 in favour of England. England scored soon after and then again on full time to seal their win. It was 2 weeks before Cole played again. He was at second five eighth in their 14-16 loss to a powerful Swinton on November 27 with 13,000 in attendance. He twice, \\"by straight dashes from the scrum, was nearly over. The third time he was actually over and grounded the ball, but was called back for some infringement\\". New Zealand outscored Swinton 4 tries to 2 but goal kicking proved the difference. It was a similar story in their match with St Helens on December 8 when they lost 12-22 despite scoring 4 tries, the same number as the winners. Cole was once again back in the centres with Jack Kirwan. Cole didn't appear in the New Zealand side again until their match with Pontypridd on Christmas Day at Taff Vale Park. They won 17-8 with Cole in the centres again though this time he was partnered with Ben Davidson. He played with Davidson again in an 18-3 win over Cumberland at a cold and wet Workington on January 8. The final match of the tour was the third test with England. Cole was to play in his second test match which New Zealand lost 17-32 at Leeds in front of 8,000 spectators in wet conditions once again. Early in the match from a counter-attack New Zealand rushed down field but Cole dropped \\"the ball when on the point of scoring\\". =Return to New Zealand, retirement and club comeback= After the touring side returned to New Zealand shores Cole played in a New Zealand side composed (almost) entirely of the Auckland members as the others had either returned to their homes or had been banned by the New Zealand R.L. for their part in the strike on tour. Their opponents were the best of the rest of Auckland and the Auckland side ran out 24-21 winners in front of 14,000 spectators at Carlaw Park on April 30. The New Zealand Herald on April 6 had reported that “Cole was not a success with the New Zealand team, but his form was not true. In club matches Cole is a useful five-eighths.” Unfortunately for Cole he would not get the chance to play for Ponsonby again for quite some time. He had badly injured his nose in the match with Auckland, which he had first done the previous season in the North Island v South Island match and he decided that he would retire temporarily for the 1927 season. Cole came out of retirement on August 20 for Ponsonby’s round 14 win over [Richmond Rovers . He made two more appearances for them in a round 1 Roope Rooster win over Grafton followed by a semi final loss against Devonport United. In 1928 he played seven times for Ponsonby early in the season but was named to play on the wing in his last match and then was omitted from the team altogether for the rest of the season. On August 4 New Zealand played England at Carlaw Park in the first test of the series and in the evening a complimentary dinner was held for the teams. As part of the evening ceremonies medallions were presented to Cole along with his fellow Auckland “loyalists” from the 1926-27 touring team (Bert Avery, Frank Delgrosso, Hec Brisbane, Craddock Dufty, Stan Webb, George Gardiner, Jack Kirwan, Charles Gregory, and Ernie Herring. The medallions were presented by New Zealand Rugby League chairman Mr. C.A. Snedden. Then in 1929 Cole was to play his last season of competitive rugby league. He was regularly named twelfth in the squads printed in the newspapers ahead of the matches indicating he was playing in the second row. However there were no mentions of him in any of the actual match reports. Then following the July 6 match with Richmond Rovers it was said that \\"the appearance of Cole, a member of the 1926 combination which toured England, caused some interest. Cole played really well and in better form should improve Ponsonby's attack\\". He had played at five-eight, replacing Thompson in this match which they won 21-16. He was named to play in a handful of matches for Ponsonby through to the end of the championship which they won for the 5th time in club history though it is likely that he did not take the field in many, or even any of these matches. He retired at the end of the season. In 1931 he participated in an 'old timers' match, playing for Mortinsen's team against Opai Asher’s team on Charity Day at Carlaw Park. Then in 1932 he was selected to play for the Ponsonby 'old-timers' match against City Rovers in their annual clash. Personal life and death Hector Cole married Florence Gladys Verrall on June 9, 1923 (she was born on 21 Dec, 1900). Hector worked as a bookbinder and cutter and in 1942 was living at 30 Kingsley St, Grey Lynn in Auckland according to the records of The New Zealand Gazette. His nephew John Cole also later played for Ponsonby. Hector died on October 21, 1981 aged 78 years of age. His wife Florence died on February 19, 1986.
