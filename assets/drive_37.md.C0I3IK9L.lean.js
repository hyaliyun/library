Believed to be one of the artist's earliest works, the bust forms part of a tomb for Santoni, who was majordomo to Pope Sixtus V from 1590 to 1592. The work was executed sometime between 1613 and 1616,Wittkower 1955, p. 231. although some have dated the work as early as 1609 (when Bernini was ten years old), including Filippo Baldinucci.Avery 1997, p. 33.Hawley, p.107 The work remains in its original setting in the church of Santa Prassede in Rome. Background In 1568, Santoni was consecrated Bishop of Alife. In 1586, he was appointed the Bishop of Tricarico. In 1590, immediately after ascending the papal throne, Pope Sixtus V appointed Santoni his majordomo. Two years later, Santoni died. When Santoni's nephew was appointed to the bishopric in 1610, he commissioned the posthumous portrait of his uncle. Description The life-size marble bust is set in an oval frame with Mannerist mouldings behind and in between a broken pediment.

It is the most powerful tugboat in German waters. History =Construction and commissioning= Emergency tow vessel Nordic entering the port of Hamburg on 7 December 2010 after its transfer from Wolgast The construction and commissioning of the Nordic were a consequence of the Pallas accident off Amrum island in 1998 when a cargo vessel ran aground and lost a substantial amount of oil.Compare: Especially the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutsche Nordsee association and many other non-governmental organisations for the protection of the environment had worked towards the commissioning of a new emergency tow vessel on the German North Sea coast. Constructions began on 27 October 2009 on the P+S Werften yards, formerly known as Peene-Werft, in Wolgast, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, with yard number 563. Sea trials were held in October 2010. In the course of these trials, the Nordic delivered a bollard pull of 207 tons (ca. 2,030 kN). After its completion on 15 November 2010 and the christening on 8 December 2010 by Susanne Ramsauer, the wife of Federal German Minister of Transport Peter Ramsauer, the ship replaced the salvage tug Oceanic which was decommissioned after 41 years in service on New Year's Day 2011. Unofficially, the construction costs of the Nordic were said to have been about ‚Ç¨ 50 million. =Operation= The Nordic is owned by NORTUG Bereederungs GmbH & Co. KG which is partially held by the members of the German consortium Arbeitsgemeinschaft K√ºstenschutz. The ship is operated by Bugsier-, Reederei- und Bergungsgesellschaft who charter the tow vessel to the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development for an initial time of ten years and a fee of ‚Ç¨114 million. The operational base is Cuxhaven on the mouth of the river Elbe. With a maximum speed of the Nordic is able to reach any stricken vessel in German North Sea waters within two hours. In order to be able to operate in a contaminated atmosphere, the ship has been fitted with superstructures that can be sealed tight and are explosion-proof.  Engine and propulsion  The ship is fitted with two MTU 20V8000M71L plants in an anti-gas operational mode, two MTU 12V4000 auxiliary engines for driving the two main electrical generators and another Diesel engine by MAN which powers the emergency generator. The Nordic has been prepared to operate in a flammable or harmful atmosphere, e.g. after a tanker accident. Among other safety measures, such cases involve the shutting down of the turbochargers so that compressed air inside them may not be ignited. However, this reduces the engine power. A seawater cooling of the exhaust system reduces the temperature of the exhaust fumes to . The propulsion is diesel-mechanical via a gearbox and shaft device by Flender AG onto two controllable-pitch propellers by Berg Propulsion which are mounted inside Kort nozzle frames.

Early life Nikoghayos Ter-Hovhannisyan was born to an Armenian family in the Ghshlagh village of Nagorno-Karabakh. His father was a priest. In 1887, he graduated from the Shusha diocesan school. He then taught in Armenian schools in the North Caucasus until 1891, when he moved to Tabriz, where he was a teacher and also the treasurer of the circle of local Armenian national figures. Beginning in 1893, he taught at the school in the village of Galasar, Salmas (modern Iran, near the border with Turkey), where he took an active part in the Armenian national and political life as a member of the Union of Armenian revolutionaries (later the Armenian Revolutionary Federation). Nikol was one of the three members of the committee ARF in Tabriz, along with Ovnanom Davtyan and Hovsep Arghutian. Active armed movement After the Hamidian massacres of Armenians from 1894 to 1896, Nikol entirely devoted himself to the Armenian national liberation movement and organization of self-defense. In 1895, he moved to Van with a group of 10 people. His house was besieged by the Kurdish Hamidiye cavalry. Although the Kurds had set fire to his house, Nikol managed to escape under the cover of smoke and went to the nearby mountains, where he and his men firing back and killed two Hamidiye. Admiring his courage, the Kurds nicknamed him \\"Duman\\" (\\"Storm\\"). He was arrested in Van, but soon released. Duman was the initiator of the 1897 Khanasor Expedition, an attack on the Kurdish Mazrik tribe and its commander Sharaf Beg for their role in the Hamidian massacres and ambush at Van, and took part in the campaign as a squad leader. The attack began on 25 July 1897 and ended on 27 July 1897. All of the men in the tribe were killed and only the women and children were spared, a mercy the Turks and Kurds never gave the Armenians. Sharaf Beg managed to escape. Afterward, Duman moved back to the Russian Empire, in Tiflis. During the 1904 Sasun uprising, he is tried to get his men to Sason, but was unable to. At the beginning of the Armenian-Tatar massacres in February 1905, he was hastily called by telegram to Baku, where he organized a self-defense and, on 7 February, had successfully arrived to fight against Tatars. Duman was then appointed head of the self-defense of Erivan region. He was an advocate of the liberation of Western Armenia and proposed a general uprising. He took part in the Dashnak party congresses, and in 1910, was present at the Second Copenhagen International Congress. Following the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, he led operations in Van, Erzurum and Trabzon. He also took part in the Persian Constitutional Revolution, leading the Dashnak party during the defense of Tabriz. Death In 1914, he became ill with tuberculosis and went for treatment in Kislovodsk. At the same time, the First World War was beginning. Feeling that he would not be able to participate with the other Armenian fedayi, Duman committed suicide with a pistol shot on the evening of 23 September 1914. He was buried in Tbilisi, at the Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi, next to the grave of one of the founders of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Simon Zavarian.

General Services Administration, 433 U.S 425 (1977), is a landmark court case concerning the principle of presidential privilege and whether the public is allowed to view a President's ‚Äúconfidential documents‚Äù.. The Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1974, ordered that the Administrator of General Services obtain President Richard Nixon‚Äôs presidential papers and tape recordings. In addition, the Act further ordered that government archivists seize these materials. These archivists would preserve the material deemed historic and return to former President Nixon the materials deemed private. Furthermore, this Act stated that material that was preserved could be used in judicial hearings and proceedings. Immediately after this Act was enacted, Richard Nixon filed a lawsuit in a federal district court claiming that the Act violated the principle of separation of powers, the principle of presidential privilege, Nixon's personal privacy, his First Amendment right of association, and further asserted that it amounted to a constitutionally prohibited Bill of Attainder. Background Historically, all presidential papers were considered the personal property of the president. Some took them at the end of their terms while others destroyed them. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first to make them available to the public when he donated them to the National Archives in 1939, as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, but did so voluntarily. This case was argued a few years after the Watergate scandal had broken out and the President was compelled to resign in the face of the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. The former President objected to the seizure of documents from the Nixon Administration, as he did not want to further tarnish the public's already negative perception of him as a corrupt and scheming politician. Given that he was not liable to criminal prosecution, as he had been pardoned, Nixon's concern for his reputation appears to be the primary reason that he did not want his private documents to be inspected by historical archivists and made available to the public. The forty two million pages of documents and eight hundred and eighty tape recordings produced during his presidency would reveal critical information about Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal, his real opinions on a wide range of issues, and further perpetuate his image as a paranoid and secretive President. These are some of the underlying personal motives as to why Richard Nixon chose to file a lawsuit against the Administrator of General Services the day after President Ford signed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act into law. President Nixon also felt that this Act broke the confidentiality promise that the Administrator of General Services gave to Nixon after he resigned from the presidency. This confidentiality agreement stated that both Richard Nixon and the General Service Administration could not access the former President's tapes and documents located near his California home without each party's respective consent. The agreement specifically provided that Richard Nixon could not withdraw any copies over a three-year period unless he made or withdrew new copies of tapes and documents, that he could only withdraw any of the original tapes after five years, and that all of the tapes would be destroyed ten years after Nixon's death. Congress was upset as to how President Nixon's official business records were to be kept concealed from public review, and wanted to make President publicly accountable for his actions. Therefore, shortly after this confidentiality agreement was announced, Congress decided to introduce a bill that would provide for greater public access to Richard Nixon's records. The conflict The main conflict in this case was whether a federal statute authorizing that the President would have his records inspected by government archivists violated the principles of separation of powers and executive privilege. In addition, there was a conflict in this case whether a President's personal materials were deemed private even though the public had a high level of interest in them. Furthermore, it was debatable whether the government's seizure of President Nixon's materials was actually \\"limited intrusion\\". The main conflict in this case was whether it was constitutional for government archivists to seize President Nixon's materials. Decision The Supreme Court decided that the Presidential Recordings and Material Preservation Act was constitutional, ruling in favor of the Administrator of General Services in a 7-2 vote and rejecting all claims that Nixon made in his lawsuit against the Administrator of General Services. The Court rejected Nixon's claim that the Act violates the presidential privilege of confidentiality, finding that the government archivists that would review Nixon's documents and tape recordings had done so with other presidents' papers without violating the confidentiality of communications between presidents and their advisers. The past work by government archivists had not harmed the institution of the presidency. Furthermore, the Court stated that the review of documents by government archivists would be no more of an intrusion than an in camera inspection of documents permitted under the Court's majority decision in United States v. Nixon. The Court rejected the argument that the Act invaded Richard Nixon's right of privacy, as there would be limited intrusion through the screening of his documents, the public has a legitimate reason to want to know more about the President's historical documents (as he is a public figure), and the impossibility of separating the small amount of private materials without first thoroughly screening all of his documents. The Court determined that Richard Nixon's privacy rights were still protected under the Act, and that his complaints about his lack of privacy were overstated. Beyond the questions of confidentiality, privilege and privacy, the Court found that the Act does not interfere with President Nixon's First Amendment rights of association. Further, the Court determined that the federal government had compelling reasons to preserve Nixon's Presidential materials, and archival screening was the least restrictive way to review presidential materials and to return private papers to the president. Finally, the Act did not violate the Bill of Attainder clause of the Constitution because this Act does not convict former President Nixon of a crime and does not expose him to prosecution. The Court commented that Congress was justified in approving the Act because Congress believed Nixon was a President who could serve as an example for future presidents. The Court determined that the purpose of this Act was not to punish President Nixon, but simply to legislate a policy that had a purpose of preserving important historical artifacts and presidential records. Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist wrote dissenting opinions. Rehnquist vigorously argued that under the provisions of the Act, all presidential papers could be seized by Congress at any time, and the Act was thus excessive. Burger asserted that the Administrator was not justified in engaging in such an invasion of privacy with respect to a President's documents. In addition, Burger contended that the Administrator was also encroaching on President Nixon's Executive Privilege and that this Act amounted to an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder.

The Occupy movement hand signals are a group of hand signals used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to negotiate a consensus.Erin Alberty, ‚ÄúOccupy SLC protesters vilify elite, camp with destitute‚Äù The Salt Lake Tribune, October 28, 2011 The signals have been equated with other hand languages used by soldiers, cliques, or even Wall Street traders. Hand signals are used instead of conventional audible signals, like applause, shouts, or booing, because they do not interrupt the speaker using the human microphone, a system where the front of the crowd repeats the speaker so that the content can be heard at the back of the crowd. Between sharing of information on Facebook, Twitter, and other news reports, the hand signals have become common at other Occupy movement protest locations. Some protesters go to neighboring groups to assist in teaching the hand signals along with other general cooperation. There are YouTube videos showing the hand signals, though the signals are not universal at all locations. Example signals Diagram of Occupy movement hand signals used in London 2011. * Up twinkles or simply twinkles are both hands raised with fingers pointing up and being wiggled. Twinkles indicates agreement with what is being said. This handsignal was borrowed from the Green Party, who borrowed it from the ASL word for applause. * Flat hands means that you are not sure, not for, or not against. One may be asked to clarify one's position. * Down twinkles are arms raised but showing the back of both hands with fingers pointing down and wiggling. Down twinkles indicate disagreement with what is being said. One will be asked by the facilitator to clarify one's objection. In Occupy Boston (possibly other sites), down twinkles go by the alternate name of \\"squid fingers\\". ** Thumbs up, neutral, or thumbs downSome locations use the thumbs signal, to show approval, neutrality, or disapproval similar to the Pollice verso of Roman gladiators. * Direct response is both hands moving alternately front to back on each side of the head and directed at an individual. Direct response indicates that critical information was missing from something that was just said. * Clarifying question is a single hand formed in the shape of a C. Clarifying question means that someone has a question that needs to be answered before that person can vote on an issue. * Point of process is a triangle formed by two hands with the index fingers touching and the thumbs touching to form a triangle shape. Point of process means that the conversation has strayed from the original topic. * Wrap it up is both hands moved in a circular motion about each other. It means that the speaker should make his or her points and finish speaking. * Raise the roof is both hands with palms facing up being moved up and down above shoulder level. Raise the roof means to speak up. * Hard block is holding arms up and crossed. This indicates a firm opposition to the proposal, a break from the consensus that cannot be supported by this individual. Twinkles and down twinkles are referred to as a \\"temperature check\\". They indicate if a group is getting close to consensus. Twinkles are also known as \\"sparkle\\" or \\"jazz hands\\" or spirit fingers.Chris Barton \\"'Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices\\", New Zealand Herald, October 29, 2011 In Agile software development, a \\"5 fingers vote\\" is also introduced to let a whole team express their confidence on a decision.

Its broadcasting location is unknown.http://www.clandestineradio.com/crw/news.php?id=236&stn;=693&news;=556 Radio Insurgente's content is focused on promoting the ideas and struggles of the Zapatista movement. Radio Insugente transmits programs in Spanish and in the indigenous languages tzotzil, tzeltal, chol and tojolabal. According to their website, they transmit \\"from various places in Chiapas directed to the Zapatista bases, the insurgentes and milicians, the commanders and local people in general\\".http://www.radioinsurgente.org/index.php?name=whoweare No new programs have been posted on the website since 2009, but CDs are on sale on the site and users can listen to previous content. History There was a prior attempt to create a Zapatista radio network in 1998 with Radio Rebelde to cover human rights violations and provide political commentary that does not seem to have ever gained much traction. The radio station was first transmitted via short wave frequency in 2001 during a high-profile Zapatista gathering in Ovente, Chiapas. With the start of Radio Insurgente in 2003, many people arranged meetings and brought their own radio sets to mark the occasion and hear the first words \\"broadcast\\" by the network, which actually came via a CD that was played through loudspeakers: Radio Insurgente has also used criticism and humor since its first broadcast, when it mocked U.S. foreign policy, Silvio Berlsuconi, Tony Blair, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, the King of Spain, and Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n. It has also made fun of the low wattage of its stations, stating that \\"We broadcast with such little power that not even electronic Viagra can raise it.\\" Since it launched it has experienced technical glitches. Prior to the launch of Radio Insurgentes, the EZLN transmitted content over clandestine FM stations. To get started, the Zapatistas built an \\"egg carton-lined studio\\" to transmit their programs. They have also trained themselves on how to operate the radio station; the group has also trained young women insurgents on producing radio content. The radio station is also completely portable; insurgents can take it up to the mountain in the morning and back down at night. Mexican broadcast laws require individuals to have a permit or concession to broadcast a radio signal, but the government makes it difficult for individuals to get a permit through red tape and other provisions. It is not uncommon for tiny wattage radio stations to pop up in Mexico, but they are often shut down by the government. The station was not sanctioned by any national laws and lacked a proper license, yet the San Andr√©s Accords between the EZLN and the Mexican government held that the indigenous communities had a right to broadcast their own content. In 2004, the station started a website where they archived recordings of their programs and sold CD copies. The website also archives the communiqu√©s and speeches given by the EZLN leader, Subcomandante Marcos. In July 2006, Subcomandante Marcos was prevented from appearing on XENK-AM Radio 620 in Mexico City because of a fear the state would discontinue advertising on the station. Hosts of the show expressed shock at the incident, and there was a protest outside of the radio station's offices. Objectives Self-proclaimed as \\"La Voz de los sin Voz\\", which translates to \\"The Voice of the Voiceless\\", Radio Insurgente's objective is to diffuse the ideals of the Zapatista movement through shortwave radio, FM radio, their website, and CD-productions. Furthermore, Radio Insurgente aims to inform listeners of the progress of the autonomy process within the Zapatista zones and promote the words and music of the indigenous Chiapas communities.http://www.radioinsurgente.org/index.php?name=whoweare Radio Insurgente is an Information and communications technology (ICT) that merges traditional forms of communication with new information technologies. This braiding of old and new forms of communication technologies is what allows Radio Insurgente to be so successful, as it can simultaneously reach the rural populations through the more traditional medium of radio and reach the urban populations through the more modern medium of the Internet. The Internet audio version of the radio network was launched in November 2004 to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the EZLN movement and focused on recordings of local indigenous musicians and story-tellers to political speeches by movement leaders and helped to serve as a recorded history of Mexico's indigenous people.http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/1793/ The Mexican army has been known to surround Zapatista communities and unleash terror on indigenous people via their soldiers and paramilitary. The EZLN has said that access to and control of the media are vital for its survival and have thus worked quietly to build their capacities in order to speak directly to their people. When Radio Insurgente first began broadcasting, the popular music that they played combined with the reading of \\"saludos\\" from their listeners led some government loyalists to unknowingly tune in.http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/1793/ Programming Radio Insurgente broadcasts daily on various frequencies in FM (according to the region). Besides Spanish, it also broadcasts in indigenous languages Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Ch'ol and Tojolab'al. Its broadcasts includes reports on breaking news affecting the Zapitista and Indigenous communities in the area. An example of the news Radio Insurgentes reports on can be seen in their April 10, 2005 report in which community leaders from Zinacantan went to see the municipal authorities to demand potable water in their community. On their way, they were attacked by thugs from the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Radio Insurgente reporters happen to be at the scene and were able to interview members of the community that were attacked. Radio Insurgente produces a weekly one-hour radio program on Fridays. The one-hour program focuses on current events in Chiapas, the history of the EZLN, indigenous women's rights and many other subjects. It also features educational messages, local music, short stories and radio-novels. The people of Mexico and the Americas are the targeted audiences of its weekly program in Spanish, but there are also interested persons from other countries. Programs are archived and audience can listen to or download the weekly programs and special programs on the official website of Radio Insuegente.

The military of Bhutan has relied on Indian support for training and materials since 1949. The military history of Bhutan begins with the Battle of Five Lamas in 1634, marking Bhutan's emergence as a nation under the secular and religious leadership of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. Before Bhutan emerged as a separate nation, it remained on the periphery of Tibetan military and political influence. The region that became Bhutan was host to several battles and waves of refugees from turmoil in Tibet. After its founding, Bhutan was invaded numerous times by outside forces, namely Tibetans, Mongols, and the British. Bhutan meanwhile invaded its traditional tributaries in Sikkim, Cooch Behar, and the Duars. Bhutan effectively ceased all international military hostilities in 1865 under the Treaty of Sinchula after its defeat by the British Empire. Under the terms of the subsequent Treaty of Punakha in 1910, Bhutan effectively became a British protectorate. Bhutan has maintained this status with India under Bhutan‚ÄìIndia relations since 1949, and has modernly engaged only in limited domestic operations against Indian separatist groups. Ancient history The earliest military history of Bhutan generally related to that of Tibet. Between the 9th century and Bhutan's emergence as a nation in the early 17th century, Bhutanese territory hosted Tibetan military settlement, waves of refugees from religious and political strife in Tibet, and some conflict between Tibetan and Indian people. In 824, Tibetan King Tritsun Desten (r. 816‚Äì836), also called Raelpachen and grandson of Trisong Detsen, went to war with an Indian ruler in Bhutan, driving him out. Tibetan troops who remained in Bhutan were called Milog, meaning \\"those that will not return.\\" The region they settle were referred to as Tshochhen Gyed. Its eight parts or divisions were Wang, Be, Med, Kawang, Chang, Thi, Thim, and Lar. In 836, Tritsun Desten was murdered by agents of his brother Langdharma. Tibetans sought refuge in Bhutan from ensuing political and religious upheaval during the reign of Langdharma (836‚Äì842). After Langdharma's assassination in 842, Tibetans continued to flee to western Bhutan, the Ngalop homeland. The centuries that followed, known as the Era of Fragmentation, were characterized by their lack of political cohesion. During much of this period, the dominant Bhutanese polity was the Kingdom of Bumthang. citing Michael Aris In the late 9th century, ethnic Tibetan forces expelled Indian princes from parts of modern Bhutan. Tibetans in this period and location developed the roots of Ngalop culture. By the 11th century, Tibetan-Mongol forces occupied the whole of Bhutan. More waves of Tibetans sought refuge in Bhutan from religious persecution. Charismatic lamas became the de facto leaders of regions in western Bhutan. In the 1360s, another wave Tibetan Gelugpa monks fled to Bhutan. Early history Ngawang Namgyal's victory at the Second Battle of Simtokha Dzong in 1634, paved the way for the unification of Bhutan under his rule. The military history of Bhutan as a nation begins with warfare between founder Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, himself a Tibetan refugee, and rulers of Tibet. Between 1627 and 1634, a series of wars culminated in the Battle of Five Lamas, the Zhabdrung emerging victorious. Military incursions from Tibet and the Mongol Empire continued through 1714. As Bhutan gained its own measure of regional power in the late 17th century, it invaded neighboring kingdoms in Sikkim, Cooch Behar, and the Duars. In 1616, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, facing arrest and following visions in which it is said that the chief guardian deities of Bhutan offered him a home, left Tibet to establish a new base in western Bhutan, founding Cheri Monastery at the head of Thimphu valley. During the Bhutanese period of theocratic rule (1616‚Äì1907), there was no regular standing army. The bow and arrow were among the principal means of arming the population during frequent upheavals and invasions. During times of crisis, the government raised militias from among local lords' retinues, all commanded by one dapon (\\"arrow chief\\"), a title used through modern times. Around 1627, the Zhabdrung built Simtokha Dzong at the entrance to Thimphu valley. From this dzong he exerted control over traffic between the powerful Paro valley to the west and Trongsa valley to the east. In 1627, during the first war against Karma Tenkyong of Tibet, Portuguese Jesuit Est√™v√£o Cacella and another priest were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan on their way to Tibet. They met with Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months, Cacella wrote a long letter from the Chagri Monastery reporting the travel. In 1629 and 1631, attempted Tibetan invasions under Karma Tenkyong failed. In 1634, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal prevailed in the Battle of Five Lamas over the Tibetan and Bhutanese forces allied against him. The Zhabdrung was thus the first to unite Bhutan into a single country. The Zhabdrung established the Drukpa Lineage as the state religion under the dual system of government, and codified the system of laws known as the Tsa Yig, based on Buddhist religious law (dharma). In 1639, another attempted invasion by Karma Tenkyong failed, followed by a joint Mongol-Tibetan force in 1643 under G√ºshi Khan that sought to destroy Nyingmapa refugees who had fled to Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. The Mongols had seized control of religious and civil power in Tibet in the 1630s and established Gelugpa as the state religion. Bhutanese rivals of Ngawang Namgyal encouraged the Mongol intrusion, but the Mongol force was easily defeated in the humid lowlands of southern Bhutan. In 1647, another attempted Tibetan invasion failed. In 1680 and 1700, Bhutan invaded Sikkim. In 1714, Tibetan forces, aided by the Mongols, again invaded Bhutan but failed to gain control. Many Bhutanese slaves during this period originated from Sikkim and the Assam Duars, objects of repeated raids by Bhutan over the centuries. A large number of these slaves were pressed into military service, and some went on to fill high posts in the Bhutanese armed forces. citing Treaty of Sinchula In the 18th century, Bhutan established its control over Cooch Behar and the Duars. As the presence of the British Empire grew in the region through the 19th century, these territories, as well as Bhutan's neighbor Sikkim, came under British control. In 1730, Cooch Behar first requested Bhutanese assistance in repelling Mughal Empire encroachments, establishing a dependent relationship with Bhutan. In 1770, Bhutan again invaded Sikkim, supported by troops from Cooch Behar. British forces storm the Dewangiri fort in 1865, during the Bhutan War. In 1772, during a succession dispute in Cooch Behar, the Druk Desi's nominee for the throne was opposed by a rival who invited British troops; in effect, Cooch Behar became a dependency of the British East India Company. Between 1772‚Äì3, British expeditionary forces drove Bhutanese garrisons out of Cooch Behar, until that time a Bhutanese dependency. The Druk Desi petitioned Lhasa unsuccessfully for assistance. On 25 April 1774, the Druk Desi signed a Treaty of Peace with the British East India Company. Under the treaty, Bhutan returned to its pre-1730 boundaries and allows the British to harvest timber in Bhutan. In 1784, British government turned over to Bhutan the Bengal Duars territory, where boundaries had been poorly defined. As in its other foreign territories, Bhutan left administration of the Bengal Duars territory to local officials and collected its revenues. In 1838, after a prior failed attempt, the British mission to Thimphu offered Bhutan a treaty providing for the extradition of Bhutanese officials responsible for incursions into Assam, free and unrestricted commerce between India and Bhutan, and settlement of Bhutan's debt to the British. In an attempt to protect its independence, Bhutan rejected the British offer. In 1841, the British annexed the Bhutanese controlled Assam Duars, paying a compensation of 10,000 rupees a year to Bhutan. The following year, Bhutan ceded control of the troublesome Bengal Duars to Britain. In 1862, Bhutanese forces raided Sikkim and Cooch Behar. The British responded by withholding all compensation payments and demanding release of all captives and return of stolen property. These demands went unheeded by the Druk Desi, as he was alleged to be unaware of frontier officials' raids. In 1864, Britain sent a peace mission to Bhutan in the wake of a recent civil war, during a period when two rival claimants to the office of Druk Desi competed for power. Though the British attempted to deal with both Druk Desis, the peace mission was rejected by Bhutan. In November 1864, Britain declared war on Bhutan over control of its traditional dependencies. The Bhutan War lasted five months, resulting in Bhutan's defeat and loss of Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, as well as the eighty-three-square-kilometer territory of Dewangiri in southeastern Bhutan, to the British. In return, Bhutan was awarded an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees under the Treaty of Sinchula, signed 11 November 1865. Monarchy and Treaty of Punakha The future King of Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuk, with his bodyguards in 1905. In the 1870s and 1880s, renewed conflict among regional rivals ‚Äî primarily the pro-British penlop of Trongsa and the anti- British, pro-Tibetan penlop of Paro ‚Äî resulted in the ascendancy of Trongsa Penlop Ugyen Wangchuck. By 1885, he had put down unrest across Bhutan, consolidated power, and cultivated closer ties with British India. Between 1903‚Äì4, Ugyen Wangchuck volunteered to accompany a British mission to Lhasa as a mediator in the British expedition to Tibet and subsequent Anglo-Tibetan Convention. In return, he was knighted and thereafter continued to accrue greater power in Bhutan. On 8 January 1910, the Treaty of Punakha amended two articles of the 1865 Treaty of Sinchula: the British agreed to double the annual stipend to 100,000 rupees and \\"to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan.\\" In turn, Bhutan agreed \\"to be guided by the advice of the British Government in regard to its external relations.\\" In 1943, the Kingdom of Bhutan began to raise its first organized an army at Trongsa, recruiting 30 Kheng troops from Mongar. During the late 1940s, the second King of Bhutan, Jigme Wangchuck, began sending recruits for training by the Indian Army in Shillong. The army recruited a further 240 men from Bumthang, Kurtoe, Mongar, and Trashigang. After basic training, the number of enlisted men came to 120 soldiers, including 20 instructors. From early on, the Bhutanese army operated security checkpoints in the southern region of the kingdom. In 1947, as the British Empire left India, direct ties to the British ended, and Bhutan remained relatively isolated from international affairs, until 1949. That year, India and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, providing that India would not interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs but that Bhutan would be guided by India in its foreign policy. This was the first international agreement that unambiguously recognized Bhutan's independence and sovereignty. The same year, India ceded to Bhutan some territories lost to the British in the 1865 Treaty of Sinchula. Modern history The modern Bhutanese armed forces comprise the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA), Royal Bodyguards (RBG), militia, and the Royal Bhutan Police. As Bhutan is a landlocked country, it has no navy. Nor does Bhutan have an air force, although the Royal Bhutan Army maintains a very small air armament possessing no combat capabilities, used solely for transport. The Royal Bodyguards are a branch of the RBA responsible for the security of the King of Bhutan, the Royal Family, and other VIPs. Under defense agreements in place since 1949, India is responsible for military training, arms supplies and the air defense of Bhutan. This agreement was affirmed and updated in February 2007 with a new treaty of friendship. Bhutan's most recent military engagements targeted Indian separatist groups operating inside Bhutan. During Operation All Clear in December 2003, Bhutanese armed forces cooperated with the Indian military in flushing out Indian militants. =Royal Bhutan Army= The Royal Bhutan Army was formed in the 1950s in response to the Chinese takeover and subsequent People's Liberation Army actions in Tibet and under intense pressure by India. In 1958, the royal government introduced a conscription system and plans for a standing army of 2,500 soldiers. The Indian government had also repeatedly urged and pressured Bhutan to end its neutrality or isolationist policy and accept Indian economic and military assistance. This was because India considered Bhutan its most vulnerable sector in its strategic defense system in regards to China. When Bhutan accepted the Indian offer, the Indian Army became responsible for the training and equipping of the RBA. The RBA established its first domestic training center at Bumthang. Around 1951, it was relocated to Lingkana and Tashichho Dzong. In 1959, another training center was established at Tencholing, which also served as the RBA general headquarters. In 1963, the Army Headquarters was moved to Dradimakhang, Thimphu. During the 1960s, the RBA established four wings, numbered as Wing 1 (Gunitsawa), Wing 2 (Changju), Wing 3 (Laya & Lingzhi), and Wing 4 (Trashigang). By 1968, the RBA consisted of 4,850 soldiers, with a recruiting goal of 600 additional soldiers a year. By 1990, the RBA was a force of 6,000 soldiers. In June 2007, the RBA stood at 9,021 active duty personnel. By 2008, this number was reduced to 8,000 active duty personnel, in line with an initiative introduced in 2005 by the Royal Government of Bhutan to reduce the strength of the RBA while increasing militia training of the Bhutanese population. The Indian Army maintains a training mission in Bhutan, known as the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT), responsible for the military training of RBA and RBG personnel. RBA and RBG officers are sent for training at the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Pune, and Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun. Project DANTAK of the Border Roads Organisation, a sub-division of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, has been operating in Bhutan since May 1961. Since then Project DANTAK has been responsible for the construction and maintenance of over 1,500 km of roads and bridges, Paro Airport and a disused airfield at Yangphula, heliports, and other infrastructure. While these serve India's strategic defence needs, it is also an obvious economic benefit for the people of Bhutan. Combat operations The Kingdom of Bhutan has engaged solely in domestic combat operations against Indian separatist groups during the winter of 2003‚Äì2004. Secessionist militant groups active in India, having established bases in southern Bhutan, defied an ultimatum to leave the kingdom. With the support of the Indian Armed Forces, the Royal Bhutan Army engaged militant camps and eliminated them all in Operation All Clear. ch√∂rten were built on the Dochu-La pass to commemorate Operation All Clear. During the early 1990s, Indian separatist groups, namely the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), and Kamtapur Liberation Organization (KLO), had begun to clandestinely set up camps in Bhutan's dense southern jungles. These camps were used to train cadres, store equipment, and launch attacks on targets in India. The Bhutanese government became aware of their presence in 1996 and from 1997, the issue was regularly discussed in the National Assembly. The Government of India began exerting diplomatic pressure on the Royal Government to remove the militant presence and offered conducting joint military operations against the militants. The Royal Government preferring a peaceful solution, declined the offer and instead initiated dialogue with the militant groups in 1998. By December 2003, negotiations failed to produce any agreement and the Royal Government unable to tolerate their presence any longer issued a 48-hour ultimatum on 13 December. On 15 December the RBA commenced military operations, dubbed Operation All Clear, against the militant groups. A combined RBA and RBG force of 6,000, operating out of 20 camps established during the six years of negotiations, attacked an estimated 3,000 militants spread across 30 militant camps. By 27 December 2003, all 30 militant camps had been captured. Additionally, the RBA seized \\"more than 500 AK 47/56 assault rifles and 328 other assorted weapons including rocket launchers and mortars, along with more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition. An anti-aircraft gun was also found at the site of the GHQ of the ULFA.\\" By 3 January 2004, all 30 militant camps (ULFA-14, NDFB-11, KLO-5) with an additional 35 observation posts, were destroyed and the militants dislodged. A total of 485 ULFA, NDFB, and KLO militants were killed, while those captured along with seized weapons and ammunition were handed over to the Government of India. Captured non-combatants were handed over to Assamese civil authorities. The RBA suffered 11 soldiers KIA, and 35 WIA. =Royal Bhutan Police= The Royal Bhutan Police is responsible for maintaining law and order and prevention of crime in Bhutan. It was formed on 1 September 1965 with 555 personnel reassigned from the Royal Bhutan Army. It was then called the \\"Bhutan Frontier Guards.\\" Its independent statutory basis was first codified with the Royal Bhutan Police Act of 1980. This framework was repealed and replaced in its entirety by the Royal Bhutan Police Act of 2009. Since 2009, the mandate of the Royal Bhutan Police has grown to include managing prisons, facilitating youth development and rehabilitation, and disaster management.

It allows programs to take advantage of the benefits of x86-64 instruction set (larger number of CPU registers, better floating-point performance, faster position-independent code, shared libraries, function parameters passed via registers, faster syscall instruction) while using 32-bit pointers and thus avoiding the overhead of 64-bit pointers. Details Though the x32 ABI limits the program to a virtual address space of 4 GiB, it also decreases the memory footprint of the program by making pointers smaller. This can allow it to run faster by fitting more code _and_ more data into cache. The best results during testing were with the 181.mcf SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark, in which the x32 ABI version was 40% faster than the x86-64 version. On average, x32 is 5‚Äì8% faster on the SPEC CPU integer benchmarks compared to x86-64. There is no speed advantage over x86-64 in the SPEC CPU floating-point benchmarks. History Running a userspace that consists mostly of programs compiled in ILP32 mode and which also have principal access to 64-bit CPU instructions has not been uncommon, especially in the field of \\"classic RISC\\" chips. For example, the Solaris operating system does so for both SPARC and x86-64. On the Linux side, Debian also ships an ILP32 userspace. The underlying reason is the somewhat \\"more expensive\\" nature of LP64 code, just like it has been shown for x86-64. In that regard, the x32 ABI extends the ILP32-on-64bit concept to the x86-64 platform. Several people had discussed the benefits of an x86-64 ABI with 32-bit pointers in the years since the Athlon 64's release in 2003, notably Donald Knuth in 2008. There was little publicly visible progress towards implementing such a mode until August 27, 2011, when Hans Peter Anvin announced to the Linux kernel mailing list that he and H. J. Lu had been working on the x32 ABI. That same day, Linus Torvalds replied with a concern that the use of 32-bit time values in the x32 ABI could cause problems in the future. This is because the use of 32-bit time values would cause the time values to overflow in the year 2038. Following this request, the developers of the x32 ABI changed the time values to 64-bit. A presentation at the Linux Plumbers Conference on September 7, 2011, covered the x32 ABI. The x32 ABI was merged into the Linux kernel for the 3.4 release with support being added to the GNU C Library in version 2.16. In December 2018 it was considered to deprecate the x32 ABI, which has not happened as of September 2019.

He was venerated by the early church in Wales as a saint, although he was never formally canonised. St Cynfarwy's Church in Anglesey is dedicated to him, and his name is also preserved in the name of the settlement around the church, Llechgynfarwy (or sometimes \\"Llechcynfarwy\\"). His feast day is in November, although the date varies between sources. Life and commemoration St Cynfarwy's Church, Llechgynfarwy Little is known for certain about Cynfarwy; his dates of birth and death are not given in the Bonedd y Saint (a Welsh genealogical tract compiled in the late 18th century using material from older manuscripts). According to the 19th-century Celtic scholar Robert Williams, Cynfarwy was active in the 7th century. According to the Bonedd y Saint, he was the son of the otherwise unknown \\"Awy ab Llehenog, Lord of Cornwall\\". Cynfarwy is venerated as a saint, although he was never canonized by a pope: as the historian Jane Cartwright notes, \\"In Wales sanctity was locally conferred and none of the medieval Welsh saints appears to have been canonized by the Roman Catholic Church\\". Church and feast day Cynfarwy is the patron saint of St Cynfarwy's Church, Llechgynfarwy in Anglesey, north Wales. According to the 19th-century Welsh historian Angharad Llwyd, he established the first church there in about 630. The present church (which is a Grade II listed building) mainly dates from the 19th century, but has some medieval fabric and a 12th-century font. Until the 19th century, there was a stone more than high in the field next to church, known Maen Llechgynfarwy (maen meaning \\"stone\\", llech meaning \\"slate\\" and \\"‚Äëgynfarwy\\" being a modified form of the saint's name). The settlement around the church, which is about from the port of Holyhead, is known as Llechgynfarwy (or sometimes as \\"Llechcynfarwy\\"). The traditional date for the feast of St Cynfarwy varies between antiquarian sources, although all place it in November. Some manuscripts say that it falls on the 10th, some on the 11th, whilst according to Angharad Llwyd and others the festival is marked on the 7th.

It uses geometric reasoning for automating the design of casting methods elements ‚Äì cores, mold cavity layout, feeders, feed aids and gating channels. Fast and intelligent simulation technology is employed to visualize mold filling and casting solidification in near-real time. Foundry engineers can quickly import a 3D model of cast part, create methods elements, simulate the casting, predict internal defects (like shrinkage porosity and sand inclusion), and modify the methods design to improve quality and yield. Product designers can improve the casting design for manufacturability by minor modifications, such as fillets at junctions.Minimizing porosity in cast junctions This enables better compatibility between part requirements and process capability, leading to zero defects.A holistic approach to zero defects Applications The latest version AutoCAST-X1 incorporates many innovations, including part thickness analysis, multi-cavity mould layout, multi-neck feeder design, vector element method for solidification simulation, automatic optimisation of feeders and gating system, tooling cost estimation and methods report generation. The database includes all major metal families and casting processes; which can be customised to accommodate new alloys and mould materials. History The software has a 20-year history of technology development at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, supported by several Ph.D. and Masters-level researchers. It is maintained and supported by 3D Foundry Tech, a company incubated at the Institute.

The company was founded in 2008 and is based in San Francisco, California. Nextdoor launched in the United States in October 2011, and is currently available in 11 countries. Users of Nextdoor are required to submit their real names and addresses (or street without the exact number) to the website; posts made to the website are available only to other Nextdoor members living in the same neighborhood. Since 2015, Nextdoor has been criticized for enabling its users to racially profile people of color. As a platform, it also has been accused of operating as fear-based media, one that connects real estate interests to pro-security proclivities, and reaffirms class and racial biases, in the process acting as an anti-democratic privatization of the public sphere. Critics also claim that Nextdoor capriciously regulates public speech through non-transparent subjective moderation, disabling accounts which post information deemed inappropriately political, controversial, or conflictual, and generally favoring reactionary, neoliberal, and conservative points of view.Keli Gabinelli, ‚ÄòWhat Is Nextdoor For?‚Äô Spaces of Imagining and Politics of Performing Community,‚Äù Theorizing the Web Presents: Watching Me, Watching You, Aug 26, 2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKYkW_g4_I0 History Nextdoor was co-founded by Nirav Tolia, Sarah Leary, Prakash Janakiraman and David Wiesen in 2008. Tolia had previously helped start Epinions. Early investors included Benchmark Capital, Shasta Ventures, and Rich Barton. Nextdoor had 80 to 100 employees. In July 2012, Nextdoor raised US$18.6 million in venture capital funding. Dan Clancy (formerly of Google) joined Nextdoor in February 2014. Nextdoor became available in the Netherlands in February 2016 in Germany in 2017, and in France in February 2018. In February 2017, Nextdoor acquired the UK local social network service Streetlife in a \\"multimillion pound deal\\". Nextdoor's different privacy and safety policies reportedly provoked concerns among some users of Streetlife, some even claiming to have been damaged.Streetlife users urged to consider privacy & safety Get Safe Online February 17, 2017 Advertising was added to the platform, including real estate advertising, in 2017. Advertising includes posts inside user's feeds about business services and products. In July 2018, then-CEO co-founder Tolia announced plans to retire as chief executive officer (CEO), stating that he intended to become chair of the company's board following the transition. In October 2018, Square's former chief financial officer Sarah Friar became CEO, succeeding Tolia. Tolia subsequently retained his seat as a member of the company board of directors. In 2019, Nextdoor acquired local news site Hoodline.  Usage  Typical platform uses include neighbors reporting on news and events in their \\"neighborhood\\" and members asking each other for local service-provider recommendations. \\"Neighborhood\\" borders were initially established with Maponics, a provider of geographical information. According to the platform's rules, members whose addresses fall outside the boundaries of existing neighborhoods can establish their own neighborhoods. \\"Founding\\" members of neighborhoods determine the name of the neighborhood and its boundaries, although Nextdoor retains the authority to change either of these. A member must attract a minimum of 10 households to establish a new \\"neighborhood\\", as of November 2016. While allowing for \\"civil debate\\", the platform prohibits canvassing for votes on forums. The service does however allow separate forums just for political discussions. According to The New York Times, these discussions are \\"separated from [a user's regular] neighborhood feeds\\". The company had established these separate forums in 12 markets by 2018. The company has stated it \\"has no plans\\" to accept political advertising.  Partnerships  The company exchanges services with government agencies such as the California Secretary of State's office and the District of Columbia Board of Elections. These public agencies collect and present voter-education information, such as voting locations and voter registration deadlines. This is offered as a link in the Nextdoor platform for members in those neighborhoods. The platform reports increased activity during disasters. In May 2017, the company offered its services to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to facilitate the delivery of geographically targeted \\"emergency and disaster preparedness\\" alerts through the platform. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration partnership allows Nextdoor to send out local-community alerts during extreme weather incidents. Nextdoor has invited police officers and government officials into its Public Agencies Advisory Council in exchange for a commitment to promote Nextdoor using blog posts and referrals. Members of the Council participate in quarterly conference calls with Nextdoor employees and receive at least one trip to the company's headquarters in San Francisco, with all expenses reimbursed by Nextdoor. Nextdoor requires individuals who join the Council to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that restricts them from disclosing certain types of information about Nextdoor without the company's permission. Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concerns about the lack of transparency associated with Nextdoor's use of NDAs. Since at least mid-2019 Nextdoor has been part of the Facebook Audience Network (FAN) which means Facebook places their clients' ads in Nextdoor. Financials Nextdoor had raised $285 million in financing. About $75 million in new funding announced that month put its valuation at $1.5 billion. In a 2017 interview with Fortune, CEO Nirav Tolia had projected \\"tens of millions\\" in revenue for 2017, but in 2018 declined to disclose the total revenue for the year as well as whether it is profitable. In May 2019, Nextdoor raised $123 million at $2.1 billion valuation. Controversies = Racial profiling = Starting in 2015, media outlets have reported that Nextdoor users have been racially profiling people of color in neighborhoods across the United States. In 2016, Nextdoor announced that users would be asked to submit identifying characteristics other than race when posting warnings about individuals or events in the neighborhood. Law enforcement officials in Oakland, California, who had generally embraced the forum as a means to connect with local residents, were wary of being seen as endorsing or associating with a website that enables racial profiling. Nextdoor changed its user interface, saying the purpose was to make it harder for users to create race-based posts. After the change, the Oakland Police Department said the changes made Nextdoor \\"more helpful\\" to the police department's work. Co-founder Tolia claimed in a February 2017 interview with Wired that Nextdoor reduced racial profiling in its crime and safety reports by 75 percent through user interface changes. A BuzzFeed News investigation indicated that racial profiling of people of color was still prevalent on Nextdoor as of May 2017, and that anti-discrimination measures previously announced by Nextdoor and proposed by Nextdoor's community members were incompletely implemented in Nextdoor's website and apps. The Atlantic discussed further concerns over hyperactive \\"crime and safety\\" sections of Seattle's private community pages on Nextdoor. According to The Atlantic, \\"Seattle Mayor Ed Murray derided an atmosphere of 'paranoid hysteria' he'd witnessed on the message boards of some of Seattle's more upscale neighborhoods.\\" The mayor told KUOW-FM, the local NPR affiliate, that Seattle's wealthiest areas are some of the most active communities on Nextdoor. \\"The neighborhoods where most of the social-media complaints are coming out of are not even the neighborhoods that have significant crime problems, which tend to be our communities of color in the south part of the city. If it's simply about creating a sense of paranoia or if it's about stigmatizing folks in our city that are struggling, then I have to think about why we're in that kind of partnership.\\" The Root documented several incidents in 2019 in which people of color and one transgender person were targeted by Nextdoor users with negative comments and \\"Spook Alerts\\" ‚Äì racially charged accusations of criminal activity ‚Äì when they were walking in their neighborhoods. In June 2020, The Verge reported that \\"Nextdoor has struggled to shed its reputation as a 'snitch' app, used by white and wealthy users to racially profile their neighbors and report them to the police\\", an issue that New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez termed the \\"Karen problem\\" in a rebuke of Nextdoor on Twitter. During the George Floyd protests, many members of the National Leads Forum ‚Äì a community of Nextdoor moderators ‚Äì criticized Nextdoor's support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and expressed a preference for All Lives Matter, a slogan that signifies opposition to BLM. A number of Nextdoor users had their accounts suspended or their posts deleted by Nextdoor moderators after commenting in race-related discussions or mentioning BLM during the protests. On June 11, Nextdoor explicitly instructed its moderators to allow discussions on the Movement for Black Lives, including BLM. In a blog post, CEO Friar denounced \\"systemic racism in our nation\\" and pledged to provide its moderators with \\"resources and support\\". = Other = The police department in Seattle had been engaging with people through \\"town hall meetings\\" held on the platform, but in 2016 local journalist Erica C. Barnett reported the meeting's possible conflict with Washington's open meeting laws. On May 14, 2014, Nirav Tolia, then-CEO of Nextdoor, was charged with felony hit-and-run for allegedly fleeing a crash on Highway 101 in Brisbane, California that left a woman injured. \\"It's ironic that the CEO of a company that is holding itself out as trying to promote neighborliness, crime watch and things like that flees the scene of an accident that he caused and doesn't bother to call 911 or stay around to exchange information or see if he caused any injuries,\\" said the woman's attorney, Joseph Brent.Lee, Henry K (May 14, 2014). \\"Police-friendly tech CEO charged with hit-and-run\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved April 17, 2014. On June 12, 2014, Tolia pled no contest and served 30 days of community service in lieu of jail time. Christina Masden et al., in a 2014 study of three neighborhoods in Atlanta, Georgia, found that Nextdoor's potential lay in \\"fostering grassroots moderation rather than the top-down approach they are currently using.\\" Masden's study also stated that despite the availability of other means of networking, participants found the Nextdoor application organizing and archiving their interactions \\"in ways that added value, above and beyond what they could accomplish with traditional media.\\" In March and April 2019, HuffPost and Wired reported that Nextdoor had paid a firm to improve its reputation by lobbying for changes to the Wikipedia articles on Nextdoor, NBC and several others.

He subsequently became one of the leading figures in post-war Germany's industrial life. Pre-war career The son of police inspector Carl Wurster and his wife, Clara Sippel Carl Wuster entered the German Imperial Army to serve in the First World War after leaving school.Carl Wurster (1900‚Äì1974) After his war service he studied chemistry at the University of Stuttgart whilst also serving with the Einwohnerwehr, a right-wing militia active in southern Germany. He subsequently took a doctorate in engineering and in 1924 took a post with BASF where he worked closely with Carl Bosch. In 1926 he was made the head of the main inorganic laboratory at IG Farben's Ludwigshafen plant, marrying Margareta Bergmann around the same time (the couple eventually having two daughters). Wurster rose through the ranks at IG Farben, becoming head of inorganic operations in 1931, chairman of the Inorganic Production Committee in 1933, a director of the company in 1936 and both a full member of the Vorstand and head of Farben's Upper Rhine Business Group. Under the Nazis Like his fellow IG Farben executive Georg von Schnitzler, Wurster was close to Dr Carl Ungerwitter, a government chemist with links to leading figures in the Schutzstaffel, and through him Wurster learned in early 1939 that an invasion of Poland was planned for September.Diarmuid Jeffreys, Hell's Cartel: IG Farben and the Making of Hitler's War Machine, Bloomsbury, 2009, pp. 212-213 Following the German occupation, Wurster went to Poland to inspect the chemical works in that country. Here he was able to determine which could be absorbed by IG Farben and utilised as part of the Nazi war effort. IG Farben was complicit in crimes committed at german nazi death camp in Auschwitz- Birkenau, leading to the death of an estimated 1.5 million people, according to the Auschwitz museum in Poland. Wurster was made a Wehrwirtschaftsf√ºhrer in 1941 and also became a member of the Military Economy Council of the Reich Economic Chamber. This was followed in 1943 by the award of a First Class War Merit Cross. He had joined the Nazi Party itself in 1937.Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich ‚Äì Wer war was vor und nach 1945, Frankfurt am Main, 2007, p .690 After the war The occupying Allies initially gave Wurster permission to remain in charge of the plant at Ludwigshaven following the end of the war but in 1947 he was arrested by American authorities to face trial at Nuremberg. However Wurster was acquitted and soon returned to a leading position in German business. He became chairman of the board at IG Farben in 1952 and successfully led moves to re-establish BASF. In the academic world he was made an honorary professor at Heidelberg University and was awarded the title of honorary doctor or honorary senator by several other German universities. He was recognised by the West Germany government when he was awarded the Great Cross of Merit with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955 and also received the Bavarian Order of Merit. He officially retired from IG Farben in 1965 but continued to be involved on the supervisory boards of a number of other companies, including Robert Bosch GmbH, Allianz and Degussa. Wurster retained links to those he had worked with as part of the Nazi war machine and on 6 February 1959 as chairman of BASF he hosted a reunion banquet for the veterans of the pre-1945 IG Farben Vorstand. The event was attended by Otto Ambros, Heinrich B√ºtefisch, Fritz Gajewski, Max Ilgner, Friedrich J√§hne, Carl Krauch, Hans K√ºhne, Wilhelm Rudolf Mann, Christian Schneider and Fritz ter Meer as well as Carl Bosch's widow.Jeffreys, Hell's Cartel, p. 349 References Category:1900 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Stuttgart Category:German chemists Category:IG Farben people Category:University of Stuttgart alumni Category:Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Recipients of the Bavarian Order of Merit Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:Nazis who served in World War I Category:People acquitted by the United States Nuremberg Military Tribunals Category:Scientists from Stuttgart Category:People from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg Category:Recipients of the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross ","title":"Carl Wurster"},{"id":"33610326","text":"The 2011‚Äì12 Savannah State Tigers basketball team represents Savannah State University in the 2011‚Äì12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

The UK edition contained two exclusive bonus tracks, \\"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\\" and \\"Saddest Cloud\\". Recording and promotion The majority of songs on the record were composed within a six month period. \\"Marble Gods\\" was released as the album's lead single, and appeared on Rough Trade's sampler album Indiepop 09. \\"Cherry Blossom\\" was also released as a single. The band promoted the album with performances at several UK music festivals, including Truck Festival. Critical reception The record received positive review upon release. Heather Phares of AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five, praising it for revisiting the \\"halcyon days of the late '80s and early '90s, when indie pop crossbred with shoegaze, and groups like Lush, Bettie Serveert, and Velocity Girl mixed those dreamy sonics with immediate hooks and melodies.\\" She summarised by saying: \\"Even if there aren't too many previously unknown sounds on Unknown Colors, Sad Day for Puppets know how to use them well.\\" A writer for Sydsvenskan complimented the disparity between the influences the band utilised in composing the record, and said they succeeded in making a record \\"better than their combined influences. There's something quite majestic going on here, even if you can't put your finger on it.\\" Likewise, Swedish magazine Muzic said: \\"The music and melodies are elaborate and well composed without being predictable or too easily accessible, which is an art in itself to master.\\" NME was complimentary of Anna Eklund's vocals, saying that her \\"spectral diction ‚Äì enshrined under glacial washes of distortion ‚Äì is seductive and richly evocative.\\" Although Joyzine was dismissive about the length of time it took the band to compose the album, and said such brevity often resulted in sub-par records, they described Unknown Colors as a major leap forward for the group. The album also received some mixed reviews.

The epicenter was located about north-northwest of the capital Lima, which was almost completely destroyed, and the subsequent tsunami devastated the port city of Callao. It was the deadliest earthquake in Peru‚Äôs history prior to the 1970 earthquake.A contemporary description of the events by one of the few survivors, the Marqu√©s de Ovando, is to be found here Tectonic setting Peru lies above the convergent boundary where the Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South American Plate at a rate of 61 mm per year. It has been the location for many large and damaging earthquakes since historical records began, most of which triggered devastating tsunamis. The southern segment of the Peruvian part of this plate boundary is affected by the presence of the Nazca aseismic ridge, on the downgoing plate. It also marks a major change in the subduction geometry between 'flat-slab' subduction to the northwest and normally dipping subduction to the southeast. The ridge appears to act as a barrier to rupture propagation, reducing the potential earthquake magnitude. The 1746 earthquake is interpreted to be a megathrust event that ruptured the whole of the northern segment of the plate interface within this zone. Earthquake The earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.6-8.8 Mw, was the largest to strike central Peru in recorded history, and the second largest of all time, after the 1868 Arica earthquake in the south of the country. Significant damage from the earthquake affected an area of about 44,000 square kilometers and it was felt up to 750 km away. The estimated rupture length was 350 km. There were at least 200 aftershocks observed in the first 24 hours after the mainshock, out of a total of 1,700 recorded in the following 112 days, although they caused no further casualties or significant damage. Damage =Earthquake= The earthquake completely destroyed the city of Lima in 3‚Äì4 minutes, and also destroyed Callao and everything else along the central Peruvian coast from Chancay in the north to Ca√±ete in the south. In Lima, all offices and all 74 churches were either damaged or destroyed leaving just 25 of the original 3,000 houses standing. Only 1,141 out of the population of 60,000 died in Lima from the earthquake shaking, despite the amount of damage. This is attributed to the intensity of the shaking increasing as the earthquake went on, giving the inhabitants the chance to escape. The total number of casualties, including those from the tsunami, was almost 6,000, although some chroniclers give higher figures for Lima, partly due to the inclusion of the effects of subsequent epidemics. =Tsunami= The earthquake triggered a tsunami, which reached the coast half an hour following the shock, causing great damage at all Peruvian ports. Callao was worst affected, with a 24-meter runup, and 5 kilometer inundation that destroyed all 23 vessels that were in its harbor. Callao's walls were destroyed and the city was inundated, killing most of the 5-6,000 inhabitants, leaving less than two hundred survivors. Those that tried to escape inland were overtaken by the wave. Eyewitness accounts indicate two waves, the first of which was up to high. Four of the boats were carried across the ruined port and thrown up to nearly a mile inland, including the warships Ferm√≠n and San Antonio. The port city of Pisco was destroyed, despite having been rebuilt further inland after the devastating tsunami that accompanied the 1687 Peru earthquake. The tsunami was also noticed at Acapulco, Mexico. Other particularly devastating tsunamis have occurred in Peru in 1586, 1604, and 1868. Aftermath The rebuilding of Lima was planned by Jose Antonio Manso de Velasco then the viceroy of Peru, with the help of the French mathematician Louis Godin. A key part of these proposals was to restrict buildings to a single storey and widen the roads, but the plans were diluted following opposition from groups within the city and second floors were allowed as long as they used bamboo in their construction rather than adobe bricks. In 1817, 70 years after the earthquake and the tsunami, the Russian-American Company employee, head of the Sitka office, Kiril Timofeevich Khlebnikov (1784‚Äì1838) visited Callao. His account of the events of what happened on 28 October 1746 may have slight factual mistakes, but he is generally considered a good witness of things he saw with his own eyes, and his attitude in writing history is characterised as sober and realistic. It is also known that he kept a diary.Svetlana G.

Remembrance Because the mural of the Lord of Miracles survived the earthquake intact, it became a special object of veneration in the city. There is an annual procession in which the image is carried through the streets of Lima, and it is customary for the faithful to wear purple during the month of October in commemoration.

It first aired on October 27, 2011 on NBC and is the series' 2011 Halloween episode. In the episode, Britta is led to believe that one member of the group is a psychopath and is determined to find out who it is. Though her plan was to gauge the reaction of the other characters after telling them a horror story, all the other characters end up telling stories of their own. Each story illustrates how each character views each other and themselves. The episode was written by series creator Dan Harmon and directed by Tristram Shapeero. It received positive reviews from critics. Plot Britta's (Gillian Jacobs) anonymous personality tests indicate that one study group member is deeply disturbed and homicidal. She tries to identify the individual by observing the group's reactions to a horror story. In her story, a couple, played by Britta and Jeff (Joel McHale), makes out in a car until an escaped psychopath attacks. Abed (Danny Pudi) criticizes the story and offers an improved version. The group proceeds to tell their own \\"horror\\" stories. In Abed's story, he and Britta visit a secluded cabin. Abed takes every logical precaution, such as bringing a radio. When the escaped psychopath threatens, they stand back-to-back holding knives. In Annie's (Alison Brie) story, she plays a schoolteacher who tames Jeff, a vampire, by teaching him how to read. When Jeff turns on Annie, she reveals herself to be a werewolf and mutilates Jeff. In Troy's (Donald Glover) story, he and Abed encounter a doctor played by Pierce (Chevy Chase), who sews them together. However, this gives Troy and Abed psychokinetic powers, with which they knock Pierce unconscious. As revenge, they sew Pierce's buttocks to his chest and swap his hands and feet. In Pierce's story, he is a stud surrounded by hot women ‚Äì Annie, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Britta. When Abed and Troy invade his home, Pierce easily subdues them. In Shirley's story, the Rapture occurs while the other group members party and use drugs. The Devil, played by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), enters, but Shirley holds him off temporarily before rising to Heaven, leaving the others to be tortured. Bored, the group tries to leave. Britta stops them by revealing the test results and explaining how the disturbed individual could kill them. Her gruesome descriptions and the flickering lights create alarm. To calm everyone down, Jeff tells a story wherein a hookman attacks the group. After questioning by Jeff, the hookman reveals himself to be Chang (Ken Jeong) and asks for a hug, and the group accepts him warmly. Jeff's story, however, fails to calm his friends. Jeff admits he filled out his test paper randomly, frustrating the group. Annie checks the papers and realizes Britta scanned them upside down. The corrected results reveal that every group member except one is crazy. The group decides not to determine who it is so they can each hope they are the sane one. The final shot reveals that the sane group member is Abed. Production The episode was written by series creator and executive producer Dan Harmon, his fourth writing credit. It was directed by Tristram Shapeero, his fifth directing credit. \\"Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps\\" was‚Äîunintentionally‚Äîthe second episode in a row to feature seven different stories, after \\"Remedial Chaos Theory.\\" \\"Chaos\\" was intended to be the third episode of the season, but was pushed back to fourth after \\"Competitive Ecology\\" due to production delays. Themes The episode examines how each character in the study group views each other and themselves, filtering everybody else through the point of view of one character. Britta always means well, but makes everything boring because she does not read her audience well. Abed makes his story boring by trying too hard to be realistic. Annie deals with her insecurities of Jeff and Britta's sexual relationship by casting Jeff as a vampire using Britta for sustenance, when only she can touch his heart. Troy values his friendship with Abed, while Pierce is overly confident in himself. Shirley sees herself as devout while pitying the rest of the group for being godless people. Jeff believes he can talk the group out of any problem and considers himself the only normal person. Cultural references The episode examines hookman and slasher stories. In Abed's story, he fixes all plot holes by having his characters take all logical precautions to minimize the chance of being killed. Annie's imagining of Jeff as a vampire who uses Britta for sustenance is a poke at the Twilight series. The scene where Annie teaches Jeff to read is reminiscent of a similar scene in Beauty and the Beast. Shirley's story involves the Rapture, wherein she goes to heaven, leaving behind the rest of the group, whom she perceives as hedonistic. Also in her story is Dean Pelton as the Devil with a chainsaw yelling \\"Gay marriage!\\" At the start of the episode, Annie goes through Britta's playlist and finds the Beetlejuice soundtrack in it. A man in a Beetlejuice costume then passes behind Annie as she says the name aloud for the third time in the show's history (\\"Beetlejuice\\" was also mentioned in \\"Communication Studies\\" by Professor Slater and in \\"Cooperative Calligraphy\\" by Britta). In the film, whenever someone says \\"Beetlejuice\\" three times, the character Betelgeuse would suddenly enter the scene. Abed is dressed-up as Inspector Spacetime, the show's interpretation of Doctor Who. Jeff dresses up for Halloween by wearing a \\"Fast and the Furious jacket.\\" At one point Troy wants to go the party because he heard the Dean has \\"free taco meat from the Army\\". This is a reference to the second-season episode \\"Epidemiology\\" in which army surplus food the Dean acquired gave people zombie-like attributes. As Britta explains that an untreated psychopath could murder anyone in the group, her murder is portrayed while she is reading \\"Warren Piece.\\" Reception =Ratings= In its original broadcast on October 27, 2011, the episode was watched by an estimated 3.42 million people. It drew a Nielsen rating/share of 1.4/4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Reviews= \\"Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps\\" received generally positive critical reviews. Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5/5 rating, saying: \\"Community always serves up great holiday episodes, so it came as no surprise that I loved \\"Horror Fiction In Seven Spooky Steps.\\" For Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com, the episode worked \\"because each of these stories is so perfectly tailored to our character‚Äôs psyches and personalities... As an episode, it was a little winding and erratic, but as something stalwart Community fans can enjoy, it was a solid hit.\\" Alan Sepinwall and Emily VanDerWerff both said that \\"Horror Fiction\\" is a strong episode on its own, but lamented the fact that it aired right after \\"Remedial Chaos Theory,\\" which had a similar episode structure which combines seven different stories. VanDerWerff said the episode was \\"pretty much just unadulterated awesome.\\" Sepinwall said \\"'Chaos Theory' was an awfully tough act to follow: a gimmick episode that was both incredibly funny while telling us important things about these characters and how they relate to each other. And I enjoyed 'Horror Fiction' a lot, but it's a gimmick episode that's mainly just funny, while reminding us of things we know pretty well about the characters.

He was a champion two- year-old who went on to become only the third horse to complete The Derby, Eclipse Stakes and St Leger treble (Tulyar, in 1952, become the most recent and fourth horse to equal the feat) as a three-year-old in 1926, a year in which he also won the St James's Palace Stakes. He won the Coronation Cup at four, but was beaten in his two remaining starts by his long-standing rival Colorado Background Coronach, a big, handsome chestnut horse standing 16.2 hands high with a white blaze, white socks on his hind feet and a light- coloured mane and tail, was bred by his owner Lord Woolavington. He was sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making him a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Apart from Coronach, Hurry On sired the winners of seven Classics including the Derby winners Captain Cuttle and Call Boy. His most influential son was the Ascot Gold Cup winner Precipitation, who sired four classic winners. Coronach was the fifth foal of the mare Wet Kiss who finished fourth in the 1916 Oaks. He was trained throughout his career by Fred Darling at Beckhampton. His regular jockey was Joe Childs, whose preferred style of holding up horses for a late run was at odds with Coronach's front running style: after the Derby he was reported to have said that \\"the bastard ran away with me!\\" Racing career =1925: two-year-old season= Coronach made his debut in July when he won a maiden race at Salisbury. He then won the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood in \\"effortless\\" style, leading the Sporting Life to describe him as \\"one of the best two-year-olds in England\\". Coronach completed his hat-trick in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, leading from the start and beating Lex by four lengths without being seriously challenged. Coronach was coughing after his Doncaster win but appeared to have made a full recovery by October. On his final start he was beaten a neck by Lex in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. He had legitimate excuses however, as the contest was run at a \\"muddling pace\\" and he came back from the race a sick horse, with a high temperature. Despite his defeat he was rated the equal best two-year-old (with Legatee) in the Free Handicap on a mark of 126lbs. =1926: three-year-old season= At three, Coronach won the Column Produce Stakes at Newmarket and started \\"the hottest favourite in years\\". for the 2000 Guineas. He started slowly and was beaten five lengths by the impressive winner Colorado. Colorado started favourite for the Derby, run in heavy rain which kept away the normally huge crowds. Over one and a half miles Coronach led all the way to reverse the Newmarket form, winning by five lengths \\"in a canter\\" from Lancegaye with Colorado third. He was never in danger of defeat in his remaining starts at three. At Royal Ascot won the St James's Palace Stakes by twenty lengths from Lex. He then won Europe's most valuable flat race, the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, beating Comedy King by six lengths. According to the Glasgow Herald \\"nothing could ever get near him\\" and Childs spent the closing stages looking round for non-existent dangers. In the St Leger at Doncaster, Coronach started at odds of 8/15 against eleven rivals. He started slowly, losing four lengths, but soon made up the lost ground and was in a clear lead (estimated at six lengths) by the time the field entered the straight. Childs did not have to put the colt under any pressure as he won by two lengths from Caissot in a record time 3:01.6. The win took Coronach's earnings for the year to over ¬£40,000 and confirmed his status as \\"the best three-year-old this season.\\" =1927: four-year-old season= Although he remained a top class performer at four, Coronach suffered increasingly from respiratory problems which eventually forced his retirement: George Lambton was reported to have said \\"It is no secret that Coronach is not sound in his wind.\\" He began the year by leading all the way to beat Embargo and Foxlaw in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June. His winning time of 2:34.0 was exceptionally fast by Epsom standards. He then won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot by twelve lengths. In a much anticipated rematch with Colorado in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Coronach made the running but was overtaken by his rival a furlong from the finish. He was eased in the closing stages and was beaten eight lengths. In his last race he finished third to Colorado in the Eclipse Stakes, beaten seven lengths. His defeats led to opinions regarding his merit being revised: from being a potential \\"horse of the century\\" he was now seen as simply \\"a good horse.\\" Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Coronach the forty-second best British horse of the 20th Century and the best Derby winner of the 1920s.Randall, J. and Morris, T., A Century of Champions, Portway Press, Halifax, 1999, p. 111 Stud career Coronach was retired to stand as a stallion at Lavington, West Sussex, until 1940 when he became the first Derby winner to be sent to New Zealand. He was not a great success in England but was more popular in France, where his progeny included the double Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Corrida.

Early years Oster was the son of Oberstleutnant Heinrich Oster and served as a volunteer for a year in the army himself in 1898 before studying chemistry at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy and the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, obtaining his doctorate in 1905.Heinrich Oster (1878‚Äì1954) He immediately went to work for Agfa and remained with them until 1914 when he returned to the army to serve in the First World War. Oster was wounded early in the war, losing his left eye as a result, and so most of his service was as a member of staff to the Commander of the German Army in Alsace, as well as in matters of arms procurement to BASF. IG Farben Following the armistice Oster was hired full-time by BASF as a deputy director and he was made a member of the board in 1921. Oster was admitted to the Vorstand of their parent company IG Farben in 1926 as an alternate member and held a number of other posts of responsibility at the company, including membership of the board's Working Committee, the post of managing director of the Nitrogen Syndicate and membership of the Subcommittee for Fertilizers and Explosives. He was promoted to full membership of the board at IG Farben in 1931. Under the Nazis Oster recognised the potential for growth of the Nazi movement and was one of the first leading figures in IG Farben to advocate close co-operation with Adolf Hitler's movement.Diarmuid Jeffreys, Hell's Cartel: IG Farben and the Making of Hitler's War Machine, Bloomsbury, 2009, p. 317 Oster held sponsoring membership of the Schutzstaffel from 1935 to 1939, a position which entitled him to officer rank in the black uniformed movement. He did not become a full member of the Nazi Party itself until 1940. In 1939 he was awarded a First Class War Merit Cross.

The Chinooks play their home games at Kapco Park on the campus of Concordia University Wisconsin. Summer collegiate leagues provide an opportunity for college players to spend their summers and display their talents to professional scouts. Players must be enrolled in college and have at least one year of athletic eligibility to participate. College players gain experience with the opportunity to play under the minor league conditions using wooden bats, minor league specification baseballs, overnight road trips, and playing nightly before fans. College interns gain experience by handling a number of duties at Chinooks games including ticketing, operations, on-field promotions, and webcast production. Games are webcast via the Northwoods League website. Chinooks players stay with local host families during the season. More than two dozen local families provide housing. Ticket prices are $14 reserved box, $11 reserved grandstand, and $8 general admission. History =League entry= The Lakeshore Chinooks became the seventh Northwoods League team in Wisconsin. Based at Concordia University Wisconsin in Mequon, a northern suburb of Milwaukee, the Chinooks were the first Northwoods League franchise to make its home in a major metropolitan area. =Kapco Park= Kapco Inc., a metal fabrication and stamping company in Grafton, donated $1 million toward completion of the school's new baseball field, named Kapco Park. The donation was part of a $2.7 million fund already allocated for the stadium. Concordia's baseball team uses Kapco Park in the spring. The Chinooks were the first Northwoods League franchise to make its home on a university campus. Kapco Park acknowledges the Milwaukee Brewers with its outfield dimensions, the last two numbers reflected in famous uniforms - 317 feet in left for Jim Gantner, 344 to left-center for Hank Aaron, 404 to center for Paul Molitor and 319 to right for Robin Yount, who helped design the fence. In 2012, the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) moved the State High School summer baseball tournament to Kapco Park until the tournament ended in 2018. Kapco Park hosted the 2014 Northwoods League All-Star Game on July 22, 2014. =2012 season= The inaugural season began May 30, 2012, vs. the Green Bay Bullfrogs (2-1 Chinooks). The home opener was Monday, June 11, 2012. The team finished with a 35-35 record, 4th place in the South division. 2012 attendance was 46,022. Launch marketing featured Robin Yount in a series of television spots and included a guest appearance by Milwaukee Brewers GM Doug Melvin. 2012 manager was John Vodenlich, the coach at UW-Whitewater. =2013 season= Eddy Morgan, Head Coach at UW-Superior, managed the Chinooks for the 2013 season. Morgan joined the Chinooks for the inaugural 2012 season as an assistant coach. Prior to UW-Superior, Morgan spent nine seasons as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at the College of St. Scholastica. Joining Morgan as an assistant coach was Scott Hood, currently an assistant coach at Kansas. Hood played at South Dakota State University where he also coached for two seasons. The 16-team Northwoods League celebrated its 20th anniversary season in 2013 with the season opener on Wednesday, May 29. Chinooks home opener was Thursday, May 30 vs. Wisconsin Rapids Rafters. Major League Baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, threw the first pitch to Major League Baseball Hall of Fame member and current minority Chinooks owner, Robin Yount. The 2013 season featured inter- divisional play for the first time since 2009. The Chinooks finished the 2013 season at 44-26, capturing first place overall in the South division. The Lakeshore Chinooks were ranked 21st on the Perfect Game Top 50 Summer Collegiate Teams for 2013. =2014 season= Northwoods League Championship Eddy Morgan returned to the Chinooks for his second season as Field Manager. Morgan was named the new head coach of the Concordia University-Wisconsin Falcons baseball team in June 2013. Mark Moriarty returned to the Chinooks coaching staff in 2014. Prior to joining the Chinooks and CUW, the St. Scholastica grad had coaching stints at Concordia St. Paul (2012) and Augustana (2008-2011). MLB Hall-of-Fame member and Lakeshore Chinooks minority owner Robin Yount's Chinooks Jersey #19 was retired by the team on May 31, 2014. On July, 21st, Bud Selig, then-Commissioner of Major League Baseball, was the featured speaker at the Northwoods League All-Star Banquet held in nearby Glendale, Wisconsin. The Northwoods League All-Star Game was held at Kapco Park on July 22, 2014. The Chinooks clinched the first- half South Division championship on the last day of the regular season when Blake Butler hit a walk-off home run to topple the Kenosha Kingfish, 5-4, at Kapco Park.http://northwoodsleague.com/blog/2014/07/01/willmar-lakeshore- first-half-division-champions/ In the second half, the Chinooks became just the third team in league history to accumulate 50 victories, winning the organization's third-straight South Division half title. The team continued its dominance through the playoffs, sweeping the overall South Division second-place Wisconsin Woodchucks two games to none in the Division Playoff to advance to the franchise's first Summer Collegiate World Series. Against the North Division champion Mankato MoonDogs, the Chinooks won the first game of the series in Mankato, 5-4, before returning to Mequon and completing their undefeated run through the playoffs with a 3-0 victory in Game Two to clinch the franchise's first-ever league championship.http://northwoodsleague.com/blog/2014/08/16/lakeshore-wins-first- franchise-championship/ = 2015 season = In what is called 'The Chinooks Fireworks Display', the Chinooks beat Kalamazoo 16-2 behind Lucas Raley's four home runs.

The subfamily appears to have arisen in Indochina and Maritime Southeast Asia and then spread to many areas around the world. Tree kingfishers are widespread through Asia and Australasia, but also appear in Africa and the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, using a range of habitats from tropical rainforest to open woodlands. The tree kingfishers are short-tailed, large-headed, compact birds with long, pointed bills. Like other Coraciiformes, they are brightly coloured. Most are monogamous and territorial, nesting in holes in trees or termite nests. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. Although some tree kingfishers frequent wetlands, none are specialist fish-eaters. Most species dive onto prey from a perch, mainly taking slow-moving invertebrates or small vertebrates.  Taxonomy  The tree kingfisher subfamily is often given the name Daceloninae introduce by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1841, but the name Halcyoninae introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 is earlier and has priority. The subfamily Halcyoninae is one of three subfamilies in the kingfisher family Alcedinidae. The other two are Alcedininae and Cerylinae. The subfamily contains around 70 species divided into 12 genera. A molecular study published in 2017 found that the genera Dacelo and Actenoides as currently defined are paraphyletic. The shovel-billed kookaburra in the monotypic genus Clytoceyx sits within Dacelo and the glittering kingfisher in the monotypic genus Caridonax lies within Actenoides. = List of species = * Genus Actenoides :* Green-backed kingfisher, Actenoides monachus :* Scaly- breasted kingfisher, Actenoides princeps :* Moustached kingfisher, Actenoides bougainvillei :* Spotted wood kingfisher, Actenoides lindsayi :* Hombron's kingfisher, Actenoides hombroni :* Rufous-collared kingfisher, Actenoides concretus * Genus Melidora :* Hook-billed kingfisher, Melidora macrorrhina * Genus Lacedo :* Banded kingfisher, Lacedo pulchella Brown-headed paradise kingfisher * Genus Tanysiptera, paradise kingfishers :* Common paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera galatea :* Kofiau paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera ellioti :* Biak paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera riedelii :* Numfor paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera carolinae :* Little paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera hydrocharis :* Buff-breasted paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera sylvia :* Black- capped paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera nigriceps :* Red-breasted paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera nympha :* Brown-headed paradise kingfisher, Tanysiptera danae * Genus Cittura :* Lilac kingfisher, Cittura cyanotis * Genus Clytoceyx :* Shovel-billed kookaburra, Clytoceyx rex * Genus Dacelo, kookaburras :* Laughing kookaburra, Dacelo novaeguineae :* Blue-winged kookaburra, Dacelo leachii :* Spangled kookaburra, Dacelo tyro :* Rufous- bellied kookaburra, Dacelo gaudichaud * Genus Caridonax :* Glittering kingfisher, Caridonax fulgidus * Genus Pelargopsis :* Stork-billed kingfisher, Pelargopsis capensis :* Great-billed kingfisher, Pelargopsis melanorhyncha :* Brown-winged kingfisher, Pelargopsis amauroptera White-throated kingfisher * Genus Halcyon :* Ruddy kingfisher, Halcyon coromanda :* White-throated kingfisher, Halcyon smyrnensis :* Javan kingfisher, Halcyon cyanoventris :* Chocolate-backed kingfisher, Halcyon badia :* Black-capped kingfisher, Halcyon pileata :* Grey-headed kingfisher, Halcyon leucocephala :* Brown-hooded kingfisher, Halcyon albiventris :* Striped kingfisher, Halcyon chelicuti :* Blue-breasted kingfisher, Halcyon malimbica :* Woodland kingfisher, Halcyon senegalensis :* Mangrove kingfisher, Halcyon senegaloides * Genus Todirhamphus :* Blue-black kingfisher, Todirhamphus nigrocyaneus :* Winchell's kingfisher, Todirhamphus winchelli :* Blue-and-white kingfisher, Todirhamphus diops :* Lazuli kingfisher, Todirhamphus lazuli :* Forest kingfisher, Todirhamphus macleayii :* White-mantled kingfisher, Todirhamphus albonotatus :* Ultramarine kingfisher, Todirhamphus leucopygius :* Vanuatu kingfisher, Todirhamphus farquhari :* Sombre kingfisher, Todirhamphus funebris :* Collared kingfisher, Todirhamphus chloris :* Torresian kingfisher, Todirhamphus sordidus :* Islet kingfisher, Todirhamphus colonus :* Mariana kingfisher, Todirhamphus albicilla :* Melanesian kingfisher, Todirhamphus tristrami :* Pacific kingfisher, Todirhamphus sacer :* Talaud kingfisher, Todirhamphus enigma :* Guam kingfisher, Todirhamphus cinnamominus :* Rusty-capped kingfisher, Todiramphus pelewensis :* Pohnpei kingfisher, Todiramphus reichenbachii :* Beach kingfisher, Todirhamphus saurophaga :* Sacred kingfisher, Todirhamphus sanctus :* Flat-billed kingfisher, Todirhamphus recurvirostris :* Cinnamon-banded kingfisher, Todirhamphus australasia :* Chattering kingfisher, Todirhamphus tuta :* Mewing kingfisher, Todirhamphus ruficollaris :* Society kingfisher, Todirhamphus veneratus :* Mangareva kingfisher, Todirhamphus gambieri :* Niau kingfisher, Todirhamphus gertrudae :* Marquesan kingfisher, Todirhamphus godeffroyi :* Red-backed kingfisher, Todirhamphus pyrrhopygia * Genus Syma :* Yellow-billed kingfisher, Syma torotoro :* Mountain kingfisher, Syma megarhyncha  Description  Kingfishers are short-tailed, large-headed, compact birds with long, pointed bills. Like other Coraciiformes, they are brightly coloured. The tree kingfishers are medium to large species, mostly typical kingfishers in appearance, although shovel-billed kookaburra has a huge conical bill, and the Tanysiptera paradise kingfishers have long tail streamers. Some species, notably the kookaburras, show sexual dimorphism.  Distribution and habitat  Most tree kingfishers are found in the warm climates of Africa, southern and southeast Asia, and Australasia. No members of this family are found in the Americas. The origin of the family is thought to have been in tropical Australasia, which still has the most species. Tree kingfishers use a range of habitats from tropical rainforest to open woodlands and thornbush country. Many are not closely tied to water, and can be found in arid areas of Australia and Africa. = Breeding = Ruddy kingfisher Tree kingfishers are monogamous and territorial, although some species, including three kookaburras, have a cooperative breeding system involving young from earlier broods. The nest is a tree hole, either natural, and old woodpecker nest, or excavated in soft or rotting wood by the kingfishers. Several species dig holes in termite nests. No nest material is added, although litter may build up over the years. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. Egg laying is staggered at one-day intervals so that if food is short, only the older, larger nestlings get fed. The chicks are naked, blind, and helpless when they hatch, and stand on their heels, unlike adults. = Feeding = Although some tree kingfishers, such as the black-capped kingfisher, frequent wetlands, none are specialist fishers. Most species are watch-and-wait hunters which dive onto prey from a perch, mainly taking slow-moving invertebrates or small vertebrates. The shovel-billed kookaburra digs through leaf litter for worms and other prey, and the Vanuatu kingfisher feeds exclusively on insects and spiders. Several other western Pacific species are also mainly insectivorous and flycatch for prey. As with the other kingfisher families, insectivorous species tend to have flattened, red bills to assist in the capture of insects.

They float on or just beneath the surface of still or slow-moving bodies of fresh water and wetlands. Also known as \\"bayroot\\", they arose from within the arum or aroid family (Araceae), so often are classified as the subfamily Lemnoideae within the family Araceae. Other classifications, particularly those created prior to the end of the twentieth century, place them as a separate family, Lemnaceae. These plants have a simple structure, lacking an obvious stem or leaves. The greater part of each plant is a small organized \\"thallus\\" or \\"frond\\" structure only a few cells thick, often with air pockets (aerenchyma) that allow it to float on or just under the water surface. Depending on the species, each plant may have no root or may have one or more simple rootlets. Reproduction is mostly by asexual budding (vegetative reproduction), which occurs from a meristem enclosed at the base of the frond. Occasionally, three tiny \\"flowers\\" consisting of two stamens and a pistil are produced, by which sexual reproduction occurs. Some view this \\"flower\\" as a pseudanthium, or reduced inflorescence, with three flowers that are distinctly either female or male and which are derived from the spadix in the Araceae. Evolution of the duckweed inflorescence remains ambiguous due to the considerable evolutionary reduction of these plants from their earlier relatives. The flower of the duckweed genus Wolffia is the smallest known, measuring merely 0.3 mm long. The fruit produced through this occasional reproduction is a utricle, and a seed is produced in a bag containing air that facilitates flotation.  Duckweed in various environments  One of the more important factors influencing the distribution of wetland plants, and aquatic plants in particular, is nutrient availability. Duckweeds tend to be associated with fertile, even eutrophic conditions. They can be spread by waterfowl and small mammals, transported inadvertently on their feet and bodies, as well as by moving water. In water bodies with constant currents or overflow, the plants are carried down the water channels and do not proliferate greatly. In some locations, a cyclical pattern driven by weather patterns exists in which the plants proliferate greatly during low water-flow periods, then are carried away as rainy periods ensue. Duckweed is an important high-protein food source for waterfowl. The tiny plants provide cover for fry of many aquatic species. The plants are used as shelter by pond- water species such as bullfrogs and fish such as bluegills. They also provide shade and, although frequently confused with them, can reduce certain light- generated growths of photoautotrophic algae. Duckweed is eaten by humans in some parts of Southeast Asia. It contains more protein than soybeans, so sometimes it is cited as a significant potential food source. Some initial investigations to what extent duckweed could be introduced in European markets show little consumer objection to the idea. The plants can provide nitrate removal, if cropped, and the duckweeds are important in the process of bioremediation because they grow rapidly, absorbing excess mineral nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphates. For these reasons, they are touted as water purifiers of untapped value. The Swiss Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries, associated with the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology, asserts that as well as the food and agricultural values, duckweed also may be used for wastewater treatment to capture toxins and for odor control, and that if a mat of duckweed is maintained during harvesting for removal of the toxins captured thereby, it prevents the development of algae and controls the breeding of mosquitoes. The same publication provides an extensive list of references for many duckweed-related topics. These plants also may play a role in conservation of water because a cover of duckweed will reduce evaporation of water when compared to the rate of a similarly sized water body with a clear surface. Despite some of these benefits, because duckweed thrives in high- nutrient wetland environments, they can be seen as a nuisance species when conditions allow them to excessively proliferate in environments that are traditionally low in nutrients. This is the case within the Everglades, where surface runoff and agricultural pollution have introduced increased levels of nutrients into an otherwise low-nutrient wetland system, which allows fast growing species such as duckweed to establish themselves, spread, and displace other native species such as sawgrass.  Taxonomy  Duckweeds belong to the order Alismatales and the family Araceae. (a) is a phylogenetic tree based on ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase large-subunit genes. (b) is a schematic ventral view of Spirodela, to show the clonal, vegetative propagation of duckweeds. Daughter fronds (F1) originate from the vegetative node (No), from the mother frond F0 and remain attached to it by the stipule (Sti), which eventually breaks off, thereby releasing a new plant cluster. Daughter fronds may already initiate new fronds (F2) themselves before full maturity. Roots are attached at the prophyllum (P). (c) shows the progressive reduction from a leaf-like body with several veins and unbranched roots to a thallus-like morphology in the Lemnoideae. The duckweeds have long been a taxonomic mystery, and usually have been considered to be their own family, the Lemnaceae. They primarily reproduce asexually. Flowers, if present at all, are small. Roots are either very much reduced, or absent entirely. They were suspected of being related to the Araceae as long ago as 1876, but until the advent of molecular phylogeny, testing this hypothesis was difficult. Starting in 1995, studies began to confirm their placement in the Araceae and since then, most systematists consider them to be part of that family. Their position within their family has been slightly less clear, however, several twenty-first century studies place them in the position shown below. Although they are in the same family as Pistia, another aquatic plant, they are not closely related. The genera of duckweeds are: Spirodela, Landoltia, Lemna, Wolffiella, and Wolffia. Duckweed genome sizes have a ten-fold range (150 to 1,500 MB), potentially representing diploids to octaploids. The ancestral genus of Spirodela has the smallest genome size (150 MB, similar to Arabidopsis thaliana), while the most derived genus, Wolffia, contains plants with the largest genome size (1,500 MB). DNA sequencing has shown that Wolffiella and Wolffia are more closely related than the others. Spirodela is at the basal position of the taxon, followed by Lemna, Wolffiella, and Wolffia, which is the most derived. To identify different duckweed genomes, a DNA-based molecular identification system was developed based on seven plastid-markers proposed by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life. The atpF- atpH non-coding spacer was chosen as a universal DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds. Fossil record Extinct free- floating aquatic plants and pollen with affinities to the Lemnoideae first appear in the fossil record during the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) as evidenced by floating leaves described as Aquaephyllum auriculatum from Patagonia, Argentina, and the lemnoid pollen genus Pandaniidites.Gallego, J., Gandolfo, M.A., C√∫neo, N.R. and Zamaloa, M.C. 2014. Fossil Araceae from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina, with implications on the origin of free-floating aquatic aroids. Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology Fossils of floating leaves with rootlets from the Paleocene of southern Saskatchewan, Canada, that were originally described as Lemna (Spirodela) scutata by John William Dawson in 1885, have been redescribed as Limnobiophyllum.Kvaƒçek, Z. 1995. Limnobiophyllum Krassilov ‚Äì A fossil link between Araceae and Lemnaceae. Aquatic Botany, vol. 50, p. 49-61. In addition to western North America, Limnobiophyllum has been reported from the Paleocene of eastern Russia and the Miocene of the Czech Republic. Unusually complete specimens from the Paleocene of Alberta, Canada, range from single leaves up to about 4 cm in diameter to rosettes of up to four leaves, some of which were connected to adjacent plants by stolons, and a few of which bear remains of flowers with anthers that contain Pandaniidites pollen.Stockey, R.A., Hoffman, G.L. and Rothwell, G.W. 1997. The fossil monocot Limnobiophyllum scutatum: Resolving the phylogeny of Lemnaceae. American Journal of Botany, vol. 84, no. 3, p. 355-368. Occurrences of lemnoid seeds described as Lemnospermum have also been reported.  Research and applications  Research and applications of duckweeds are promoted by two international organizations, The International Lemna AssociationThe International Lemna Association (ILA) Official Website and the International Steering Committee on Duckweed Research and Applications.International Steering Committee on Duckweed Research and Applications (ISCDRA) Official Website In July 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute announced that the Community Sequencing Program would fund sequencing of the genome of the giant duckweed, Spirodela polyrhiza. This was a priority project for DOE in 2009. The research was intended to facilitate new biomass and bioenergy programs. The results were published in February 2014. They provide insight into how this plant is adapted to rapid growth and an aquatic lifestyle.Wang, W. et al. The Spirodela polyrhiza genome reveals insights into its neotenous reduction fast growth and aquatic lifestyle. Nat. Commun. 5:3311 doi: 10.1038/ncomms4311 (2014). =Potential clean energy source= Duckweed is being studied by researchers around the world as a possible source of clean energy. In the U.S, in addition to being the subject of study by the DOE, both Rutgers University and North Carolina State University have ongoing projects to determine whether duckweed might be a source of cost-effective, clean, renewable energy. Duckweed is a good candidate as a biofuel because it grows rapidly, produces five to six times as much starch as corn per unit of area, and does not contribute to global warming. Duckweed removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and it may have value for climate change mitigation. =Filtration of contaminants and nutrients= Duckweed also functions as a bioremediator by effectively filtering contaminants such as bacteria, nitrogen, phosphates, and other nutrients from naturally occurring bodies of water, constructed wetlands, and wastewater.

Related biblical, religious and historical English terms include the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land, the Holy Land, and Palestine (see also Israel (disambiguation)). The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the Hebrew Bible, with specific mentions in Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Nine times elsewhere in the Bible, the settled land is referred as \\"from Dan to Beersheba\\", and three times it is referred as \\"from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt\\" (1 Kings 8:65, 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8). These biblical limits for the land differ from the borders of established historical Israelite and later Jewish kingdoms; over time these have included the United Kingdom of Israel, the two kingdoms of Israel (Samaria) and Judah, the Hasmonean Kingdom, and the Herodian kingdom, which at their heights ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries. Jewish religious belief defines the land as where Jewish religious law prevailed and excludes territory where it was not applied.Rachel Havelock, River Jordan: The Mythology of a Dividing Line, University of Chicago Press, 2011 p.210. It holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the Torah, particularly the books of Genesis and Exodus, as well as on the later Prophets. According to the Book of Genesis, the land was first promised by God to Abram's descendants; the text is explicit that this is a covenant between God and Abram for his descendants. Abram's name was later changed to Abraham, with the promise refined to pass through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham's grandson. This belief is not shared by most adherents of replacement theology (or supersessionism), who hold the view that the Old Testament prophecies were superseded by the coming of Jesus,Michael J. Vlach, Has the Church Replaced Israel?: A Theological Evaluation, B&H; Publishing Group, 2010 pp.3-5. a view often repudiated by Christian Zionists as a theological error.Stephen Spector,Evangelicals and Israel: The Story of American Christian Zionism, Oxford University Press, 2009 p.21. Evangelical Zionists variously claim that Israel has title to the land by divine right,Donald E. Wagner, Walter T. Davis, Zionism and the Quest for Justice in the Holy Land, The Lutterworth Press, 2014 p.161. or by a theological, historical and moral grounding of attachment to the land unique to Jews (James Parkes).Anthony J. Kenny, Catholics, Jews, and the State of Israel, Paulist Press, 1993 pp.75-78. The idea that ancient religious texts can be warrant or divine right for a modern claim has often been challenged,Michael Prior, The Bible and Colonialism: A Moral Critique, A&C; Black 1997 p.171: ‚ÄòAs an agent of legitimacy in international law, the Zionist appeal to Tanakh for legitimation of its claims to Eretz Israel is not much more compelling than if the Portuguese and Spanish Governments today presented to the UN the bulls off Nicholas V and Alexander VI, which also claimed divine authority, in their bid to reclaim the lands of the New World. p.171.Ian Bickerton, The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Guide for the Perplexed, A&C; Black, 2012 p.13. and Israeli courts have rejected land claims based on religious motivations.Eugene Cotran, Chibli Mallat, David Stott, (eds.) The Arab-Israeli Accords: Legal Perspectives, BRILL, 1996 pp.11-12. During the League of Nations mandatory period (19201948) the term \\"Eretz Yisrael\\" or the \\"Land of Israel\\" was part of the official Hebrew name of Mandatory Palestine. Official Hebrew documents used the Hebrew transliteration of the word \\"Palestine\\" ◊§◊ú◊©◊™◊ô◊†◊î (Palestina) followed always by the two initial letters of \\"Eretz Yisrael\\", ◊ê◊¥◊ô Aleph-Yod.The Holy Land in History and Thought: Papers Submitted to the International conference edited by Mo≈°e ≈†ƒÅr√¥nIsrael Cohen, A Short History of Zionism, p.96, London, Frederick Muller Co., 1951 The Land of Israel concept has been evoked by the founders of the State of Israel. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the West Bank, referred to in official Israeli discourse as the Judea and Samaria Area, from the names of the two historical Jewish kingdoms.  Etymology and biblical roots  1916 map of the Fertile Crescent by James Henry Breasted. The names used for the land are \\"Canaan\\" \\"Judah\\" \\"Palestine\\" and \\"Israel\\" Map of Eretz Israel in 1695 Amsterdam Haggada by Abraham Bar-Jacob. The term \\"Land of Israel\\" is a direct translation of the Hebrew phrase (Eretz Yisrael), which occasionally occurs in the Bible, and is first mentioned in the Tanakh in , following the Exodus, when the Israelite tribes were already in the Land of Canaan.Keith W. Whitelam, The Invention of Ancient Israel: The Silencing of Palestinian History, (1996) Routledge 2013, page 43. The words are used sparsely in the Bible: King David is ordered to gather 'strangers to the land of Israel' (hag-g√™r√Æm ‚ÄôƒÉ≈°er, b…ô‚Äôere·π£ yi≈õrƒÅ‚Äô√™l) for building purposes (), and the same phrasing is used in reference to King Solomon's census of all of the 'strangers in the Land of Israel' (). Ezekiel, though generally preferring the phrase 'soil of Israel' (‚Äôadmat yi≈õrƒÅ‚Äô√™l), employs eretz israel twice, respectively at and .Joseph Blenkinsopp, Ezekiel, Westminster John Knox Press, 1990, p.152: Quote: \\"It may be surprising to learn that the designation \\"the land of Israel\\" (‚Äôere·π£ yi≈õrƒÅ‚Äô√™l), in common use today, occurs for the first time in Ezekiel (40:2; 47:18) and very rarely elsewhere (I Chron. 22:2; II Chron. 2:17), apart from the more restrictive allusion to the Northern Kingdom. By preference, however, Ezekiel speaks of the \\"soil of Israel\\" (‚Äôadmat yi≈õrƒÅ‚Äô√™l), a phrase that occurs eighteen times in the book and nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. (The title \\"holy land,\\" literally \\"holy soil\\", used preferentially by Christians, occurs only once, at Zech. 2:12.)\\" According to Martin Noth, the term is not an \\"authentic and original name for this land\\", but instead serves as \\"a somewhat flexible description of the area which the Israelite tribes had their settlements\\". According to Anita Shapira, the term \\"Eretz Yisrael\\" was a holy term, vague as far as the exact boundaries of the territories are concerned but clearly defining ownership.Anita Shapira, 1992, Land and Power, , p. ix The sanctity of the land (kedushat ha-aretz) developed rich associations in rabbinical thought,Bradley Shavit Artson, 'Our Covenant with Stones: A Jewish Ecology of Earth,' in Judaism and Envirobnmental Ehics: A Reader,Lexington Books, 2001 pp.161-171,p.162 where it assumes a highly symbolic and mythological status infused with promise, though always connected to a geographical location.Michael L. Satlow, Creating Judaism: History, Tradition, Practice, p.160, Columbia University Press, 2006. Nur Masalha argues that the biblical boundaries are \\"entirely fictitious\\", and bore simply religious connotations in Diaspora Judaism, with the term only coming into ascendency with the rise of Zionism. The Hebrew Bible provides three specific sets of borders for the \\"Promised Land\\", each with a different purpose. Neither of the terms \\"Promised Land\\" (Ha'Aretz HaMuvtahat) or \\"Land of Israel\\" are used in these passages: , and use the term \\"the land\\" (ha'aretz), as does in which it is promised explicitly to \\"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob... and to their descendants after them,\\" whilst describes the \\"Land of Canaan\\" (Eretz Kna'an) which is allocated to nine and half of the twelve Israelite tribes after the Exodus. The expression \\"Land of Israel\\" is first used in a later book, . It is defined in detail in the exilic Book of Ezekiel as a land where both the twelve tribes and the \\"strangers in (their) midst\\", can claim inheritance.Rachel Havrelock, River Jordan: The Mythology of a Dividing Line,University of Chicago Press, 2011, p.21. The name \\"Israel\\" first appears in the Hebrew Bible as the name given by God to the patriarch Jacob (). Deriving from the name \\"Israel\\", other designations that came to be associated with the Jewish people have included the \\"Children of Israel\\" or \\"Israelite\\". The term 'Land of Israel' (Œ≥·øÜ ·º∏œÉœÅŒ±ŒÆŒª) occurs in one episode in the New Testament (Matthew 2:20‚Äì21), where, according to Shlomo Sand, it bears the unusual sense of 'the area surrounding Jerusalem'. The section in which it appears was written as a parallel to the earlier Book of Exodus. Biblical borders =Genesis 15= describes what are known as \\"Borders of the Land\\" (Gevulot Ha-aretz),Kol Torah, vol. 13, no. 9, Torah Academy of Bergen County, 8 November 2003 which in Jewish tradition defines the extent of the land promised to the descendants of Abraham, through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob.See 6th and 7th portion commentaries by Rashi The passage describes the area as the land of the ten named ancient peoples then living there. More precise geographical borders are given which describes borders as marked by the Red Sea (see debate below), the \\"Sea of the Philistines\\" i.e., the Mediterranean, and the \\"River\\", the Euphrates), the traditional furthest extent of the Kingdom of David.Stuart, Douglas K., Exodus, B&H; Publishing Group, 2006, p. 549Tyndale Bible Dictionary, Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., 2001, p. 984 Genesis gives the border with Egypt as Nahar Mitzrayim ‚Äì nahar in Hebrew denotes a river or stream, as opposed to a wadi. =Exodus 23= A slightly more detailed definition is given in , which describes the borders as \\"from the sea of reeds (Red Sea) to the Sea of the Philistines (Mediterranean sea) and from the desert to the Euphrates River\\", though the Hebrew text of the Bible uses the name, \\"the River\\", to refer to the Euphrates. Only the \\"Red Sea\\" (Exodus 23:31) and the Euphrates are mentioned to define the southern and eastern borders of the full land promised to the Israelites. The \\"Red Sea\\" corresponding to Hebrew Yam Suf was understood in ancient times to be the Erythraean Sea, as reflected in the Septuagint translation. Although the English name \\"Red Sea\\" is derived from this name (\\"Erythraean\\" derives from the Greek for red), the term denoted all the waters surrounding Arabia‚Äîincluding the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, not merely the sea lying to the west of Arabia bearing this name in modern English. Thus, the entire Arabian peninsula lies within the borders described. Modern maps depicting the region take a reticent view and often leave the southern and eastern borders vaguely defined. The borders of the land to be conquered given in Numbers have a precisely defined eastern border which included the Arabah and Jordan. =Numbers 34= describes the land allocated to the Israelite tribes after the Exodus. The tribes of Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh received land east of the Jordan as explained in . provides a detailed description of the borders of the land to be conquered west of the Jordan for the remaining tribes. The region is called \\"the Land of Canaan\\" (Eretz Kna'an) in and the borders are known in Jewish tradition as the \\"borders for those coming out of Egypt\\". These borders are again mentioned in , and . According to the Hebrew Bible, Canaan was the son of Ham who with his descendants had seized the land from the descendants of Shem according to the Book of Jubilees. Jewish tradition thus refers to the region as Canaan during the period between the Flood and the Israelite settlement. Eliezer Schweid sees Canaan as a geographical name, and Israel the spiritual name of the land. He writes: The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is thus \\"geo-theological\\" and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments.The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny, By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, , p.56. Thus, the renaming of this landmarks a change in religious status, the origin of the Holy Land concept. uses the term Canaan strictly for the land west of the Jordan, but Land of Israel is used in Jewish tradition to denote the entire land of the Israelites. The English expression \\"Promised Land\\" can denote either the land promised to Abraham in Genesis or the land of Canaan, although the latter meaning is more common. The border with Egypt is given as the Nachal Mitzrayim (Brook of Egypt) in Numbers, as well as in Deuteronomy and Ezekiel. Jewish tradition (as expressed in the commentaries of Rashi and Yehuda Halevi, as well as the Aramaic Targums) understand this as referring to the Nile; more precisely the Pelusian branch of the Nile Delta according to Halevi‚Äîa view supported by Egyptian and Assyrian texts. Saadia Gaon identified it as the \\"Wadi of El-Arish\\", referring to the biblical Sukkot near Faiyum. Kaftor Vaferech placed it in the same region, which approximates the location of the former Pelusian branch of the Nile. 19th century Bible commentaries understood the identification as a reference to the Wadi of the coastal locality called El-Arish. Easton's, however, notes a local tradition that the course of the river had changed and there was once a branch of the Nile where today there is a wadi. Biblical minimalists have suggested that the Besor is intended. =Deuteronomy 19= Deuteronomy 19:8 indicates a certain fluidity of the borders of the promised land when it refers to the possibility that God would \\"enlarge your borders.\\" This expansion of territory means that Israel would receive \\"all the land he promised to give to your fathers\\", which implies that the settlement actually fell short of what was promised. According to Jacob Milgrom, Deuteronomy refers to a more utopian map of the promised land, whose eastern border is the wilderness rather than the Jordan.Jacob Milgrom, Numbers (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: JPS, 1990), 502. Paul R. Williamson notes that a \\"close examination of the relevant promissory texts\\" supports a \\"wider interpretation of the promised land\\" in which it is not \\"restricted absolutely to one geographical locale\\". He argues that \\"the map of the promised land was never seen permanently fixed, but was subject to at least some degree of expansion and redefinition.\\"Paul R. Williamson, \\"Promise and Fulfilment: The Territorial Inheritance\\", in Philip Johnston and Peter Walker (eds.), The Land of Promise: Biblical, Theological and Contemporary Perspectives (Leicester: Apollos, 2000), 20‚Äì21. =2 Samuel 24= On David's instructions, Joab undertakes a census of Israel and Judah, travelling in an anti-clockwise direction from Gad to Gilead to Dan, then west to Sidon and Tyre, south to the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites, to southern Judah and then returning to Jerusalem. Biblical commentator Alexander Kirkpatrick notes that the cities of Tyre and Sidon were \\"never occupied by the Israelites, and we must suppose either that the region traversed by the enumerators is defined as reaching up to though not including [them], or that these cities were actually visited in order to take a census of Israelites resident in them.\\"Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 2 Samuel 24, accessed 23 August 2017 =Ezekiel 47= provides a definition of borders of land in which the twelve tribes of Israel will live during the final redemption, at the end of days. The borders of the land described by the text in Ezekiel include the northern border of modern Lebanon, eastwards (the way of Hethlon) to Zedad and Hazar-enan in modern Syria; south by southwest to the area of Busra on the Syrian border (area of Hauran in Ezekiel); follows the Jordan River between the West Bank and the land of Gilead to Tamar (Ein Gedi) on the western shore of the Dead Sea; From Tamar to Meribah Kadesh (Kadesh Barnea), then along the Brook of Egypt (see debate below) to the Mediterranean Sea. The territory defined by these borders is divided into twelve strips, one for each of the twelve tribes. Hence, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47 define different but similar borders which include the whole of contemporary Lebanon, both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and Israel, except for the South Negev and Eilat. Small parts of Syria are also included. =From Dan to Beersheba= The common biblical phrase used to refer to the territories actually settled by the Israelites (as opposed to military conquests) is \\"from Dan to Beersheba\\" (or its variant \\"from Beersheba to Dan\\"), which occurs many times in the Bible. It is found in many biblical verses., , , , , , , , and . =Division of Tribes= The 12 tribes of Israel are divided in 1 Kings 11. In the chapter, King Solomon's sins lead to Israelites forfeiting 10 of the 12 tribes:  Jewish beliefs  =Rabbinic laws in the Land of Israel= Valley of Sur According to Menachem Lorberbaum, > In Rabbinic tradition, the land of Israel consecrated by the returning > exiles was significantly different in it(s?) boundaries from both the > prescribed biblical borders and the actual borders of the pre-Exilic > kingdoms.

Buchanan, Margaret Moore (eds) States, > nations, and borders: the ethics of making boundaries. Cambridge University > Press, 2003 pp19-40 p.24 According to Jewish religious law (halakha), some laws only apply to Jews living in the Land of Israel and some areas in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria (which are thought to be part of biblical Israel). These include agricultural laws such as the Shmita (Sabbatical year); tithing laws such as the Maaser Rishon (Levite Tithe), Maaser sheni, and Maaser ani (poor tithe); charitable practices during farming, such as pe'ah; and laws regarding taxation. One popular source lists 26 of the 613 mitzvot as contingent upon the Land of Israel.p.xxxv, R. Yisrael Meir haKohen (Chofetz Chayim), The Concise Book of Mitzvoth. This version of the list was prepared in 1968. Many of the religious laws which applied in ancient times are applied in the modern State of Israel; others have not been revived, since the State of Israel does not adhere to traditional Jewish law. However, certain parts of the current territory of the State of Israel, such as the Arabah, are considered by some religious authorities to be outside the Land of Israel for purposes of Jewish law. According to these authorities, the religious laws do not apply there.Yeshivat Ohr Yerushalayim, Shmita According to some Jewish religious authorities, every Jew has an obligation to dwell in the Land of Israel and may not leave except for specifically permitted reasons (e.g., to get married).The Ramban's addition to the Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot. There are also many laws dealing with how to treat the land. The laws apply to all Jews, and the giving of the land itself in the covenant, applies to all Jews, including converts.Ezekiel 47:21 \\"You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 22 You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who have settled among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 23 In whatever tribe the alien settles, there you are to give him his inheritance,\\" declares the Sovereign LORD. =Inheritance of the promise= Traditional religious Jewish interpretation, and that of most Christian commentators, define Abraham's descendants only as Abraham's seed through his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. Johann Friedrich Karl Keil is less clear, as he states that the covenant is through Isaac, but also notes that Ishmael's descendants, generally the Arabs, have held much of that land through time. =Modern Jewish debates on the Land of Israel= The Land of Israel concept has been evoked by the founders of the State of Israel. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the West Bank, which is referred to in official Israeli discourse as Judea and Samaria, from the names of the two historical Israelite and Judean kingdoms. These debates frequently invoke religious principles, despite the little weight these principles typically carry in Israeli secular politics. Ideas about the need for Jewish control of the land of Israel have been propounded by figures such as Yitzhak Ginsburg, who has written about the historical entitlement that Jews have to the whole Land of Israel.Yitzhak Ginsburgh, Rectifying the State of Israel (Israel: Gal Einai Institute, 2002), 52. Ginsburgh's ideas about the need for Jewish control over the land has some popularity within contemporary West Bank settlements. However, there are also strong backlashes from the Jewish community regarding these ideas. The Satmar Hasidic community in particular denounces any geographic or political establishment of Israel, deeming this establishment has directly interfering with God's plan for Jewish redemption. Joel Teitelbaum was a foremost figure in this denouncement, calling the Land and State of Israel a vehicle for idol worship, as well as a smokescreen for Satan's workings.Teitelbaum, Al Ha-Ge‚Äòulah ve-al Ha-Temurah (1967), pp. 7-9, 20, as translated in Ravitzky, Messianism, Zionism, and Jewish Religious Radicalism, 75.  Christian beliefs  =Inheritance of the promise= During the early 5th century, Saint Augustine of Hippo argued in his City of God that the earthly or \\"carnal\\" kingdom of Israel achieved its peak during the reigns of David and his son Solomon.Augustine, The City of God (Book XVII), Chapter II. \\"And it was fulfilled through David, and Solomon his son, whose kingdom was extended over the whole promised space; for they subdued all those nations, and made them tributary. And thus, under those kings, the seed of Abraham was established in the land of promise according to the flesh, that is, in the land of Canaan...\\" He goes on to say however, that this possession was conditional: \\"...the Hebrew nation should remain in the same land by the succession of posterity in an unshaken state even to the end of this mortal age, if it obeyed the laws of the Lord its God.\\" He goes on to say that the failure of the Hebrew nation to adhere to this condition resulted in its revocation and the making of a second covenant and cites : \\"Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah, a new testament: not according to the testament that I settled for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my testament, and I regarded them not, says the Lord.\\" Augustine concludes that this other promise, revealed in the New Testament, was about to be fulfilled through the incarnation of Christ: \\"I will give my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts, and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people\\". Notwithstanding this doctrine stated by Augustine and also by the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (Ch. 11), the phenomenon of Christian Zionism is widely noted today, especially among evangelical Protestants. Other Protestant groups and churches reject Christian Zionism on various grounds.  History  Jewish religious tradition does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.Solomon Zeitlin, The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion? (Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936). Cited in, Edelheit and Edelheit, History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary Nonetheless, during two millennia of exile and with a continuous yet small Jewish presence in the land, a strong sense of bondedness exists throughout this tradition, expressed in terms of people-hood; from the very beginning, this concept was identified with that ancestral biblical land or, to use the traditional religious and modern Hebrew term, Eretz Yisrael. Religiously and culturally the area was seen broadly as a land of destiny, and always with hope for some form of redemption and return. It was later seen as a national home and refuge, intimately related to that traditional sense of people-hood, and meant to show continuity that this land was always seen as central to Jewish life, in theory if not in practice.Hershel Edelheit and Abraham J. Edelheit, History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary, Westview Press, 2000. p 3. =Ottoman era= Having already used another religious term of great importance, Zion (Jerusalem), to coin the name of their movement, being associated with the return to Zion.De Lange, Nicholas, An Introduction to Judaism, Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30. . The term \\"Zionism\\" was derived from the word Zion, which is the other name for Jerusalem, and is associated with the Return to Zion and coined by Austrian Nathan Birnbaum, in his journal Selbstemanzipation (Self Emancipation) in 1890. The term was considered appropriate for the secular Jewish political movement of Zionism to adopt at the turn of the 20th century; it was used to refer to their proposed national homeland in the area then controlled by the Ottoman Empire. As originally stated, \\"The aim of Zionism is to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by law.\\"Basel Program Different geographic and political definitions for the \\"Land of Israel\\" later developed among competing Zionist ideologies during their nationalist struggle. These differences relate to the importance of the idea and its land, as well as the internationally recognized borders of the State of Israel and the Jewish State's secure and democratic existence. Many current governments, politicians and commentators question these differences. = British Mandate = Three proposals for the post World War I administration of Palestine. The red line is the \\"International Administration\\" proposed in the 1916 Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, the dashed blue line is the 1919 Zionist Organization proposal at the Paris Peace Conference, and the thin blue line refers to the final borders of the 1923‚Äì48 Mandatory Palestine. This 1920 stamp, issued by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, set a precedent for the wording of subsequent Mandate stamps. The Biblical concept of Eretz Israel, and its re-establishment as a state in the modern era, was a basic tenet of the original Zionist program. This program however, saw little success until the British commitment to \\"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\\" in the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Chaim Weizmann, as leader of the Zionist delegation, at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference presented a Zionist Statement on 3 February. Among other things, he presented a plan for development together with a map of the proposed homeland. The statement noted the Jewish historical connection with \\"Palestine\\".3 Feb 1919 Statement, quote \\"... recognize the historic title of the Jewish people to Palestine and the right of Jews to reconstitute in Palestine their National Home\\" It also declared the Zionists' proposed borders and resources \\"essential for the necessary economic foundation of the country\\" including \\"the control of its rivers and their headwaters\\". These borders included present day Israel and the occupied territories, western Jordan, southwestern Syria and southern Lebanon \\"in the vicinity south of Sidon\\". The subsequent British occupation and British acceptance of the July 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, advanced the Zionist cause. Early in the deliberations toward British civilian administration, two fundamental decisions were taken, which bear upon the status of the Jews as a nation; the first was the recognition of Hebrew as an official language, along with English and Arabic, and the second concerned the Hebrew name of the country. In 1920, the Jewish members of the first High Commissioner's advisory council objected to the Hebrew transliteration of the word \\"Palestine\\" ◊§◊ú◊©◊™◊ô◊†◊î (Palestina) on the ground that the traditional name was ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú (Eretz Yisrael), but the Arab members would not agree to this designation, which in their view, had political significance. The High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, himself a Zionist, decided that the Hebrew transliteration should be used, followed always by the two initial letters of \\"Eretz Yisrael,\\" ◊ê◊¥◊ô Aleph-Yod:Israel Cohen, A Short History of Zionism, p.96, London, Frederick Muller Co., 1951, > He was aware that there was no other name in the Hebrew language for this > land except 'Eretz-Israel'. At the same time he thought that if 'Eretz- > Israel' only were used, it might not be regarded by the outside world as a > correct rendering of the word 'Palestine', and in the case of passports or > certificates of nationality, it might perhaps give rise to difficulties, so > it was decided to print 'Palestine' in Hebrew letters and to add after it > the letters 'Aleph' 'Yod', which constitute a recognised abbreviation of the > Hebrew name. His Excellency still thought that this was a good compromise. > Dr. Salem wanted to omit 'Aleph' 'Yod' and Mr. Yellin wanted to omit > 'Palestine'. The right solution would be to retain both.\\" > ‚ÄîMinutes of the meeting on November 9, 1920.Meeting on November 9, 1920, > quoted in: Memorandum No. 33, \\"Use of the Name Eretz-Israel‚Äô,\\" in the Report > by the Palestine Royal Commission, 1937, Memoranda Prepared by the > Government of Palestine, C. O. No. 133. The compromise was later noted as among Arab grievances before the League's Permanent Mandate Commission.League of Nations, Permanent Mandate Commission, Minutes of the Ninth Session (Arab Grievances), Held at Geneva from 8 to 25 June 1926 During the Mandate, the name Eretz Yisrael (abbreviated ◊ê◊¥◊ô Aleph- Yod), was part of the official name for the territory, when written in Hebrew. These official names for Palestine were minted on the Mandate coins and early stamps (pictured) in English, Hebrew \\"(◊§◊ú◊©◊™◊ô◊†◊î (◊ê◊¥◊ô\\" (Palestina E\\"Y) and Arabic \\"( ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ\\"). Consequently, in 20th-century political usage, the term \\"Land of Israel\\" usually denotes only those parts of the land which came under the British mandate.Israel's declaration of independence says \\"the British Mandate over Eretz Yisrael, and the Israeli law uses the term Eretz Yisrael to denote the territory subject directly to the British Mandate law, e.g. Article 11 of the \\"Government and Law Ordinance 1948\\" issued by Israel's Provisional State Council. On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181(II)) recommending \\"to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union.\\" The Resolution contained a plan to partition Palestine into \\"Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem.\\" =Israeli period= On 14 May 1948, the day the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the Jewish People's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation, in which it declared \\"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.\\"Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: THE DECLARATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL: May 14, 1948: Retrieved 24 April 2012 When Israel was founded in 1948, the majority Israeli Labor Party leadership, which governed for three decades after independence, accepted the partition of Mandatory Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states as a pragmatic solution to the political and demographic issues of the territory, with the description \\"Land of Israel\\" applying to the territory of the State of Israel within the Green Line. The then opposition revisionists, who evolved into today's Likud party, however, regarded the rightful Land of Israel as Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema (literally, the whole Land of Israel), which came to be referred to as Greater Israel. Joel Greenberg, writing in The New York Times relates subsequent events this way: > The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought his party to > power for the first time in a stunning election victory over Labor. A decade > before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition > accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, > Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria > (the West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not > annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a > recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel it into a > binational state instead of a Jewish one. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, the 1977 elections and the Oslo Accords, the term Eretz Israel became increasingly associated with right-wing expansionist groups who sought to conform the borders of the State of Israel with the biblical Eretz Yisrael.Raffaella A. Del Sarto, Israel's Contested Identity and the Mediterranean, The territorial-political axis: Eretz Israel versus Medinat Israel, p. 8 :Reflecting the traditional divisions within the Zionist movement, this axis invokes two concepts, namely Eretz Israel, i.e. the biblical \\"Land of Israel\\", and Medinat Israel, i.e. the Jewish and democratic State of Israel. While the concept of Medinat Israel dominated the first decades of statehood in accordance with the aspirations of Labour Zionism, the 1967 conquest of land that was part of \\"biblical Israel\\" provided a material basis for the ascent of the concept of Eretz Israel. Expressing the perception of rightful Jewish claims on \\"biblical land\\", the construction of Jewish settlements in the conquered territories intensified after the 1977 elections, which ended the dominance of the Labour Party. Yet as the first Intifada made disturbingly visible, Israel's de facto rule over the Palestinian population created a dilemma of democracy versus Jewish majority in the long run. With the beginning of Oslo and the option of territorial compromise, the rift between supporters of Eretz Israel and Medinat Israel deepened to an unprecedented degree, the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin in November 1995 being the most dramatic evidence. Modern usage =Usage in Israeli politics= Early government usage of the term, following Israel's establishment, continued the historical link and possible Zionist intentions. In 1951‚Äì2 David Ben-Gurion wrote \\"Only now, after seventy years of pioneer striving, have we reached the beginning of independence in a part of our small country.\\"David Ben-Gurion, \\"The Call of Spirit in Israel\\", in State of Israel, Government Yearbook, 5712 (1951/1952), page x. Soon afterwards he wrote \\"It has already been said that when the State was established it held only six percent of the Jewish people remaining alive after the Nazi cataclysm. It must now be said that it has been established in only a portion of the Land of Israel. Even those who are dubious as to the restoration of the historical frontiers, as fixed and crystallised and given from the beginning of time, will hardly deny the anomaly of the boundaries of the new State.\\"David Ben- Gurion, \\"Israel among the Nations\\", in State of Israel, Government Year-book, 5713 (1952), page 15. The 1955 Israeli government year-book said, \\"It is called the 'State of Israel' because it is part of the Land of Israel and not merely a Jewish State. The creation of the new State by no means derogates from the scope of historical Eretz Israel\\".State of Israel, \\"Israel, the State and the Nation\\" in Government Year-book, 5716 (1955), page 320. Herut and Gush Emunim were among the first Israeli political parties basing their land policies on the Biblical narrative discussed above. They attracted attention following the capture of additional territory in the 1967 Six-Day War. They argue that the West Bank should be annexed permanently to Israel for both ideological and religious reasons. This position is in conflict with the basic \\"land for peace\\" settlement formula included in UN242. The Likud party, in the platform it maintained until prior to the 2013 elections, had proclaimed its support for maintaining Jewish settlement communities in the West Bank and Gaza, as the territory is considered part of the historical land of Israel. In her 2009 bid for Prime Minister, Kadima leader Tzipi Livni used the expression, noting, \\"we need to give up parts of the Land of Israel\\", in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and to maintain Israel as a Jewish state; this drew a clear distinction with the position of her Likud rival and winner, Benjamin Netanyahu. However, soon after winning the 2009 elections, Netanyahu delivered an address at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the Arab world, on the topic of the Middle East peace process. He endorsed for the first time the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, while asserting the right to a sovereign state in Israel arises from the land being \\"the homeland of the Jewish people\\". The Israel‚ÄìJordan Treaty of Peace, signed on 1993, led to the establishment of an agreed border between the two nations, and subsequently the state of Israel has no territorial claims in the parts of the historic Land of Israel lying east of the Jordan river. Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day, ) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the Ark of the Covenant. =Palestinian viewpoints= According to Palestinian historian Nur Masalha, Eretz Israel was a religious concept which was turned by Zionists into a political doctrine in order to emphasize an exclusive Jewish right of possession regardless of the Arab presence. Masalha wrote that the Zionist movement has not given up on an expansive definition of the territory, including Jordan and more, even though political pragmatism has engendered a focus on the region west of the Jordan River.

It was founded in 1994 as a film studio by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen (together, SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each. In December 2005, the founders agreed to sell the studio to Viacom, parent of Paramount Pictures. The sale was completed in February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and signed a $1.5 billion deal to produce films with India's Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,AFP: DreamWorks, India's Reliance Sign Major Deal , AFP, September 21, 2008 re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity.

History  = DreamWorks SKG: original founding = The original company was founded following Jeffrey Katzenberg's resignation from the Walt Disney Company in 1994. Katzenberg approached Steven Spielberg and David Geffen about forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG in October 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners plus $500 million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and $300 million from Cheil Jedang Group heiress . Lee got CJ Group distribution rights to DreamWorks films in Asia except Japan. Their new studio was based at offices on the Universal Studios lot, in the same bungalow as Amblin Entertainment. Despite access to sound stages and sets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictures on location. Usually, the company would film in a soundstage or set in a major studio. DreamWorks, now a label under Amblin Partners, is still based on the Universal lot. In December 1994, DreamWorks Television was formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year TV production joint venture with the Capital Cities/ABC.McClellan, Steve. (December 5, 1994). \\"ABC makes high-profile production leap.\\" Broadcasting & Cable. 1994. HighBeam Research. Accessed on December 27, 2013. The company was set up to produce series for broadcast network, cable channels and first run syndication with no first look for ABC, but financial incentives favored ABC. The first show, Champs, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named division chief executive in June 1995. DWTV's first success was Spin City on ABC. The Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cities/ABC in February 1996.Fabrikant, Geraldine. THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Disney and ABC Shareholders Solidly Approve Merger Deal January 05, 1996. The New York Times. Accessed July 8, 2013. In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement with NBC with a first look clause. In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged with Amblin Television. In 1995, traditional animation artists from Amblimation joined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part of Pacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming PDI/DreamWorks. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. For then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films. Amblimation would be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to join DreamWorks Animation. The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer and joint venture between DreamWorks and Microsoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000, Electronic Arts announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it with EA Pacific and Westwood Studios to form EA Los Angeles, later Danger Close Games. In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal with MCA Inc. (then parent company of Universal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years. MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million. In 1996, the company's record label, DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which was George Michael's album Older. The first band signed to the label was eels, who released their debut album Beautiful Freak (1997). The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 to Universal Music Group, which operated the label as DreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist, Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.Stark, Phyllis, \\"Toby Keith topped country charts, shook up Music Row,\\" Billboard magazine, December 24, 2005, p. YE-18. In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films, The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism; Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; and Mouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse. In 1998, the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by Dreamwerks Production Group, Inc., a company mostly specializing in Star Trek conventions. The same year, PDI/DreamWorks produced its first full-length animated features, Antz and The Prince of Egypt, which were distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute PDI/DreamWorks productions through their distribution name until 2004. In 2000, DreamWorks was planning in building a studio backlot after buying 1,087 acres of land in the Playa Vista area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons. Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive Academy Awards for Best Picture for American Beauty, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). The same year, Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute art-house, independent and foreign films, was founded. The division experienced success with the anime films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release of The Chumscrubber. However, The Chumscrubber was a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese film Casshern. For the period beginning October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks films were distributed in the domestic theatrical and worldwide television market by DreamWorks Pictures and in international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment markets by Universal Pictures. In 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company. David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss on Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, and also overestimated the DVD demand for Shrek 2.DVD: doom, gloom or boom?, CNN In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures, War of the Worlds was produced as a joint effort with Paramount Pictures which was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, while The Island bombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally through Warner Bros.. = Paramount ownership = In December 2005, the original Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions. The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by the second iteration of Viacom, which had recently split from the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006. On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library to Soros Strategic Partners and Dune Entertainment II. The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed to Sony/ATV Music Publishing when the company acquired Viacom's Famous Music subdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006.Viacom to Sell DreamWorks Film Library. Associated Press. March 18, 2006. Retrieved on July 20, 2009. On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million. = Reliance-Spielberg joint venture = In June 2008, Variety reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year. Several public equity funds were approached for financing, including Blackstone Group, Fuse Global, TPG Capital and several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. In September 2008, Variety reported that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firm Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group to create a stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount. In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases. The Viacom-owned DreamWorks was then renamed DW Studios. On February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through the Touchstone Pictures banner. The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan by Walt Disney Studios to DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then with Starz. The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier. DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009. DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011, I Am Number Four, Cowboys & Aliens, and Fright Night failed, while The Help, Real Steel and Spielberg's War Horse had success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, the company was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment in April 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as 20th Century Fox, who co-financed Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The company continued to utilize Disney's marketing unit. In August that year, after renegotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal with Mister Smith Entertainment to distribute its films in EMEA, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia. = Amblin Partners venture = In September 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016, with The Light Between Oceans being released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement. During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films. The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact. Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films, as well as acquiring the \\"DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC\\" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance in December 2015. On December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance, Entertainment One, and Participant Media partnered to launch the content production company Amblin Partners, relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company. In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label, Focus Features. The Girl on the Train was the first film released under the new agreement. On February 15, 2017, Comcast's Universal acquired a minority stake in Amblin Partners, strengthening the relationship between Universal and Amblin, and reuniting a minority percentage of the DreamWorks Pictures label with its former animation division DreamWorks Animation, which was acquired by Universal's parent company NBCUniversal on August 22, 2016.  Logo  The DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on a crescent moon while fishing. The general idea for the logo was the idea of company co-founder Steven Spielberg, who wanted a computer-generated image. Illustrator Robert Hunt was commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model. The logo was then turned into a motion graphic at Industrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman. It was animated by ILM animation supervisor Wes Takahashi. Music accompanying the logo to start live-action DreamWorks movies was specially composed by John Williams; the 2004 DreamWorks Animation logo originally had music adapted from the track \\"Fairytale\\" for the film Shrek (2001), the logo was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, one of the co-composers of Shrek. Two years after its acquisition by Universal Pictures, it received a new fanfare composed by John Powell, the other composer of Shrek, adapting some cues from Shrek 2 to create the music for the logo. The new fanfare debuted on February 22, 2019, with the release of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.

Currently, no production automobile manufacturers use carburetors as a part of the fuel delivery system. Fuel injection technology has been found to be one of the most important technical advances in stock automobiles since NASCAR was founded in 1947.NASCAR: Shift to fuel injection a quantum leap at F1 Pulse Some find it more significant than the transition from rear-wheel drive vehicles to front- wheel drive vehicles during the late 1980s; which ultimately failed and caused NASCAR to revert to using a cast-iron eight-cylinder rear-wheel drive engines. People who like contemporary NASCAR racing are avid fans of technology; they are curious about how fuel injection affects the outcome of a typical NASCAR race. However, they must also placate the \\"traditional\\" NASCAR fan who has been watching NASCAR before the 1980s.Going Beyond Gen-6 at NASCAR.com While the sale of manual transmission vehicles would start to decline in the 1970s and plummet in the 1980s, NASCAR continued to hold a strict policy of only allowing manual transmission vehicles in the Sprint Cup Series to this very day. Cars that compete in the NASCAR Xfinity Series (previously known as Nationwide Series) cars are powered by carburetors; in addition to trucks that compete in NASCAR's Camping World Truck Series. Summary =History= During the 1957 NASCAR Grand National season, president of NASCAR, Bill France, Sr., immediately banned fuel injection from NASCAR. This ruling was in result to the dominance of the 1957 Chevrolet. General Motors did not offer many 1957 Chevrolet stock productions with mechanical fuel injection. However, enough were produced to allow it into NASCAR competition due to homologation rules. This ban on fuel injection would continue into the 21st century. Initially, NASCAR indicated that it would transition to fuel injection midway through the 2011 season. They ultimately decided to delay the transition for one more year. Starting in the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, carburetors have been officially replaced with fuel injection - making the technology legal after 55 years of being \\"outlawed.NASCAR sets fuel injection for '12 but keeping restrictor plates at USA TodayNASCAR Moves to Fuel Injection, Bosch First Approved Supplier at Auto Service WorldBosch to provide oxygen sensors for fuel injection at NASCAR.com\\" The first race in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series history to use fuel injection was the 2012 running of the traditionally carburetor-friendly Daytona 500; which took take place on February 26. The first series of tests that were applied to the new fuel injection system began on the Thursday practice prior to the 2011 Quaker State 400 race; Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. was the fastest driver inside a fuel injection vehicle and Ford was the quickest vehicle. Stock car racing technology had fallen behind the technology used in vehicles that are mass-produced for the general public. The reason behind this is that NASCAR didn't take advantage of fuel injection when fuel injected vehicles started to almost completely replace carburetor-powered vehicles during the late 1980s.NASCAR teams get first look at fuel injection at Yahoo Sports Outside the NASCAR racing circuit, the American automobile manufacturers would make the final two models to run on carburetors: the 1990 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser and the 1990 Buick Estate Wagon. Neither of these vehicles raced in NASCAR during the 1990 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season; Oldsmobile was represented by the Cutlass Supreme model at the time while Buick was represented by the Regal model. Brian Z. France has stated in a January 26, 2012 interview that \\"fuel injection will excite the automobile manufacturers and stimulates the technology companies\\"; making the stream of technological advances in NASCAR even stronger.France, NASCAR seek to carry momentum into '12 at NASCAR.com NASCAR has opted to eventually replace V8 pushrod engines with a turbocharged V6 engine that could deliver the speed the NASCAR fans are accustomed to by 2017. This level of change would also bring NASCAR Cup Series vehicles closer to their \\"street\\" counterparts with a minimal amount of research and development needed.NASCAR could abandon V8 engines by 2017 at Race Car Engineering =Purpose= Fuel injection system The fuel injection system that NASCAR will use in all future Sprint Cup Series races has been jointly developed by McLaren Electronic Systems and Freescale Semiconductor; each team will have to pay $26,000 per vehicle for the conversion to fuel injection. Its legacy in motorized vehicles dates all the way back to the 1980 Cadillac Eldorado; which offered a primitive version of electronic fuel injection that is found in current Sprint Cup Series vehicles.The Power Inside NASCAR at Freescale Personnel on all the racing teams will have to adjust to the new technology. Restrictor plates, however, will remain in the series for an indefinite period of time because major accidents at Daytona and Talladega made it necessary for a device to slow down the vehicles to half of their normal horsepower. Sprint Cup vehicles (powered using carburetors) can only go up to at a typical Daytona 500 race while the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series pickup trucks can do up to and don't require restrictor plates. The fuel-injected NASCAR Sprint Cup vehicles may run slightly faster than their predecessors; also making new challenges for the restrictor plate manufacturers. Fuel injection allows a precise amount of fuel to suit the amount of air flowing through the engine; making it more efficient. Fuel injection is also used to regulate the horsepower rating of the stock cars; making the sport safer, providing for more fuel efficient vehicles, in addition to cleaning the environment for the spectators in and out of the race. There are more than 150 different adjustments that Sprint Cup Series crew chiefs can make with fuel injection; as opposed to 24 different adjustments with a carburetor.NASCAR Fuel Injection? at Real Car Guys Engineers and mechanics that are employed in NASCAR will develop methods to keep the top speed of the vehicles at less than on the longest tracks of the circuit like Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway. The stock car racing organization will have a special authorization code that will keep hackers away from tampering with the vehicles using workaround programs. Since the cars run on Sunoco's Green E15 fuel mixture, the new fuel delivery system will move the Sprint Cup Series towards more alternative fuels. All the sounds of the NASCAR stock cars are nearly identical to their carburetor- powered ancestors; the new vehicles even function the same as the \\"Gen 4\\" and \\"Gen 5\\" vehicles. The ability to download information from the electronic units of the cars will play a role in the elimination of tandem drafting that has hampered NASCAR in recent years.Day 2 of testing brings more competition changes at NASCAR.com NASCAR Sprint Cup races can start in temperatures as low as without making the vehicles suffer through major engine problems. NREL/TP-540-43543, ORNL/TM-2008/117 The leap into ethanol-based fuel is becoming as challenge as the Early 2014 North American cold wave has caused temperatures in much of the Southern United States to drop below zero in the early hours of the morning. One of the downsides of allowing 15% ethanol fuel is the big jump in corn prices in recent years. Even though the 2012 North American drought has made the production of ethanol too expensive to put on a nationwide scale, NASCAR continues to use E15 ethanol fuel as an alternative to their \\"E0\\" gasoline that was used in the past. Suggested measures by the NASCAR community could see NASCAR using either bamboo-based ethanol, E85 ethanol from surplus corn or even compressed natural gas in the foreseeable future.Make NASCAR Mean Something at Gas2.org Approximately 75 psi of fuel pressure is created during the injection of fuel into the system; just slightly more pressure on the stock car than an over pressured tire on a standard bicycle. =On-track results= Brad Keselowski emerged as the first NASCAR Cup Series champion of the fuel injection era after the 2012 running of the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Florida; just as Tony Stewart was the last NASCAR Cup Series champion of the carburetor era. His first full season as a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver came in 2010; where he finished in 25th place in the overall championship standings. The first win of a restrictor plate race during the fuel injection era would go to Matt Kenseth. Unfortunately, Kenseth simply could not keep the consistency to win any other restrictor plate race during the current fuel injection era. Roger Penske would become the first person to win the owner's championship while fielding cars with fuel injection. Chevrolet has won the first manufacturer's championship of the fuel injection area; keeping their momentum going from the carburetor era of racing. Surprisingly enough, Toyota has managed to produce a strong number of points in the 2012 manufacturer's standings; losing to Chevrolet by a mere 36 points. Even with Toyota's overall success in the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, their vehicles picked up an incredible eight engine failures to neutralize the eight wins that they accumulated during the course of that season. Most of these wins in 2012 for Toyota were picked up by Denny Hamlin. Not a single engine failure has yet been attributed to electronic fuel injection. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was responsible for accomplishing the one-millionth mile under fuel injection as he was leading lap 34 at the 2013 Bank of America 500. After two full seasons of fuel injected engines, it is safe to say that the performance is on par if not better than their predecessor. Drivers can actually save more fuel under caution by shutting the car off as fuel injection takes far less fuel to restart. Teams can also make minute adjustments prior to the race in order to slightly detune the engine to a more fuel efficient setting. However, the change has further broadened the gap between top tier and underfunded teams as the latter cannot afford to hire a separate employee to monitor and adjust the settings while the former can.

Committee to Save Laguna Honda The first recorded usage of the name Friends of Laguna Honda occurred in the late 1990s as supporters of Laguna Honda Hospital rallied to save the institution from being shut down. The hospital faced a host of challenges including antiquated facilities, dwindling staff numbers, and a potential cut off of federal funding of $250,000 per day in Medicare and Medi-Cal payments due to overcrowding and poor conditions. An expensive renovation and rebuilding of the hospital was required. In early 1998, an influential group of San Franciscans with diverse interests formed the ‚ÄúLaguna Honda First Committee.‚Äù This group advocated that a bond measure for Laguna Honda Hospital should be approved before passing bond measures to support any other causes or institutions. At the time, the De Young Museum, Academy of Sciences, and the Conservatory of Flowers all were seeking to pass bond measures. A $503 million bond measure was proposed in July 1998, but as the largest ever bond measure at the time, it faced difficult prospects for gaining voter approval. Organizers of the Laguna Honda First Committee changed their name to ‚ÄúFriends of Laguna Honda‚Äù to focus on developing a new lower cost bond measure. After the bond amount was reduced to $299 million, supporters changed their name again to the Committee to Save Laguna Honda and led the campaign for voter approval of this bond measure. That bond measure passed successfully in November 1999. Laguna Honda Hospital Volunteers, Inc.

After the bond measure passed, Louise Renne, who retired as City Attorney in 2002, started up the new Laguna Honda Foundation in 2003. Renne's LH Foundation was active in doing public relations, including the re-branding of LHH Volunteers Inc. In 2010, LHH Volunteers, Inc. first adopted the business alias of Friends of Laguna Honda, and underwent a re-branding campaign over the next few years.

It is the sequel to A Chinese Ghost Story and is followed by A Chinese Ghost Story III. Plot Following the events of the first film, Ning (Leslie Cheung) parts ways with the Taoist Yin (Wu Ma) and returns to his home village, which has since fallen on desperate times. Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning.

Biography Dufaure was born at Saujon, Charente-Maritime, and began his career as an advocate at Bordeaux, where he won a great reputation by his oratorical gifts. He abandoned law for politics and, in 1834, was elected deputy. In 1839, he became minister of public works in the ministry of Jean-de-Dieu Soult, and succeeded in freeing railway construction in France from the obstacles which until then had hampered it. Losing office in 1840, Dufaure became one of the leaders of the Opposition, and on the outbreak of the revolution of 1848, he accepted the Republic and joined the party of moderate republicans. On 13 October, he became minister of the interior under Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac, but retired on the latter's defeat in the presidential election. During the Second French Empire, Dufaure abstained from public life, and practised at the Paris bar with such success that he was elected b√¢tonnier in 1862. In 1863, he succeeded to √âtienne-Denis Pasquier's seat in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. In 1871, he became a member of the Assembly, and proposed Adolphe Thiers as President of the Republic. Dufaure became the minister of justice as chief of the party of the \\"left-centre,\\" and his tenure of office was distinguished by the passage of the jury-law. In 1873, he fell with Thiers, but in 1875 resumed his former post under Louis Buffet, whom he succeeded on 9 March 1876, the first to become president of the council (his predecessors wore the title of vice-presidents of the council). In the same year, he was elected a life senator. On 12 December, he withdrew from the ministry owing to the attacks of the republicans of the left in the chamber and of the conservatives in the senate. After the conservatives' defeat on 16 May, he returned to power on 24 December 1877. Early in 1879, Dufaure took part in compelling the resignation of Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta, but immediately afterwards (1 February), worn out by opposition, he retired. As Prime Minister, he served as the Acting President of the Republic on 30 January 1879. See G Picot, M. Dufaure, sa vie et ses discours (Paris, 1883).

Written, produced, and directed by Bill Brummel, it first aired on June 6, 2011 on MSNBC. Synopsis Bryon Widner (born c. 1977) became a skinhead at the age of 14, and he spent 16 years involved with racist organizations in the midwestern United States. Described as a \\"pit bull\\", Widner co-founded Vinlanders Social Club, a white power group in Indiana that soon gained a reputation for excessive violence. This organization became one of the fastest-growing racist skinhead organizations in the US. In 2005, Widner married Julie Larsen, who had three children from a previous marriage. In 2006, the couple had a son. The responsibilities of fatherhood gave Widner the desire to reform and leave the racist movement, a desire shared by Larsen. Widner left his organization and endured years of death threats and harassment while attempting to turn his life around. Widner's efforts to rejoin wider society were significantly hampered by his extensive facial tattoos, many of which were violent or racist. Larsen feared that Widner would take drastic action to remove the tattoos, such as immersing his face in acid. Larsen eventually contacted anti-racist activist Daryle Lamont Jenkins of One People's Project who put her in contact with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). After \\"several weeks of conversation,\\" SPLC representatives agreed to help Widner in his quest to remove his facial tattoos. They found a plastic surgeon who was willing to perform the procedure, and an anonymous donor provided $35,000 for the procedures. The complete removal of Widner's facial tattoos took a little over a year and a half and over a dozen individual procedures, all of which were excruciatingly painful.

In November 1926, W. A. Harriman & Co., Inc., purchased \\"a substantial interest\\" in the bank, with Bigelow remaining as the president. At the time of the Harriman investment, The New York Times described the business of Bigelow's bank as follows: \\"This bank is said to be the only institution in New York City confining its activities entirely to individual deposit accounts, and makes a point of extending banking facilities to small accounts. It does no commercial business and discounts no commercial paper, confining its loans only to marketable collateral.\\" In May 1928, the Eastern Exchange Bank moved its headquarters from 10 Broadway to the Harriman Building at 37 Broadway.

At one stroke, it annulled the legislation of 1640‚Äì1648 (and in effect the legislation of all parliaments since 1633), covering the time of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Commonwealth. This parliament was sometimes known disparagingly as the \\"Drunken Parliament\\". Legislation The idea of the Act Rescissory was first mentioned as a joke among the Lords of the Articles, and was afterwards agreed to at a meeting when few of them were sober. Sir George Mackenzie of Tarbet, known as the \\"passionate cavalier\\", was loudest supporter for the Act Rescissory. This was \\"a general act rescissory\\", that is, an act rescinding every proceeding of all the \\"pretended parliaments\\", conventions, committees, etc., since the commencement of the troubles (1633) in Scotland, with the coronation of Charles I at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh that year, and the subsequent Bishops' Wars. It was objected that two of these parliaments were sanctioned by the presence respectively of the late and present King. John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton, Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland replied that, in both cases, the King was not morally a free agent; and an act which obliterated at once the legislation of several years, and vested the government of the kingdom in church and state almost absolutely in the King, was carried with only thirty dissidents. This extravagant Act was followed by a recess of some weeks. Meanwhile, the King issued his proclamation for restoring church government by Bishops in Scotland, and the newly appointed Scottish prelates having received ordination from Sheldon, Bishop of London, in Westminster Abbey, went back to Scotland to take the government of the Kirk, and their places in the Scottish Parliament. It appears to have been directly due to the reactionary enthusiasm of the Restoration Parliament itself. Effect on the Episcopacy and Presbyterianism This Act virtually meant a return to Episcopacy, so that monarchy and Episcopacy came back together. After Bishops had been procured, consecrated, and seated in the Scottish Parliament, severities increased steadily against the Presbyterians, who formed the majority of the population, especially in the centre and south and west of Scotland. One result of the Rescissory Act was that all the ministers who obtained livings from 1649 to 1661 were held not to have been appointed at all, and therefore were at once thrust out of their jobs. They numbered nearly 400, and their expulsion caused great discontent in Scotland. The extinction of this Act brought into operation the old law of 1592, by which the Church Courts were bound to induct any minister presented by the Crown or any lay patron; and thus, after an interregnum of 12 years, patronage came into full vigour, and it so continued till after the Revolution of 1688, when it was modified by the Act of 1690.

The first fragment of the Muonionalusta meteorite was found in 1906 near the village of Kitki√∂j√§rvi. Around forty pieces are known today, some being quite large. Other fragments have been found in a area in the Pajala district of Norrbotten County, approximately north of the Arctic Circle. The meteorite was first described in 1910 by Professor A. G. H√∂gbom, who named it after the nearby place Muonionalusta on the Muonio River. It was studied in 1948 by Professor Nils G√∂ran David Malmqvist. The Muonionalusta meteorite, probably the oldest known meteorite (4.5653 ¬± 0.0001 billion years), marks the first occurrence of stishovite in an iron meteorite. The name Muonionalusta has Finnish roots: it comes from the name of the Muonio River (+ possessive particle -(o)n-) and alusta, meaning \\"base, foundation, stand, mat, tray\\", thus probably \\"base of the Muonio\\". Description Studies have shown it to be the oldest discovered meteorite impacting the Earth during the Quaternary Period, about one million years ago. It is quite clearly part of the iron core or mantle of a planetoid, which shattered into many pieces upon its fall on our planet. Since landing on Earth the meteorite has experienced four ice ages. It was unearthed from a glacial moraine in the northern tundra. It has a strongly weathered surface covered with cemented faceted pebbles. Composition Slice (across 9.6 cm) of a Muonionalusta meteorite fragment, showing the Widmanst√§tten pattern. New analysis of this strongly shock-metamorphosed iron meteorite has shown a content of 8.4% nickel and trace amounts of rare elements‚Äî0.33 ppm gallium, 0.133 ppm germanium and 1.6 ppm iridium. It also contains the minerals chromite, daubr√©elite, schreibersite, akagan√©ite and inclusions of troilite. For the first time, analysis has proved the presence of a form of quartz altered by extremely high pressure‚Äîstishovite, probably a pseudomorphosis after tridymite. From the article \\"First discovery of stishovite in an iron meteorite\\": > Stishovite, a high pressure polymorph of SiO2, is an exceptionally rare > mineral...and has only been found in association with a few meteorite impact > structures.... Clearly, the meteoritic stishovite cannot have formed by > isostatic pressure prevailing in the core of the parent asteroid.... One can > safely assume then that stishovite formation (in the Muonionalusta > meteorite) is connected with an impact event. The glass component might have > formed directly as a shock melt.... A 2010 study reported the lead isotope dating in the Muonionalusta meteorite and concluded the stishovite was from an impact event hundreds of millions of years ago: \\"The presence of stishovite signifies that this meteorite was heavily shocked, possibly during the 0.4 Ga [billion years] old breakup event indicated by cosmic ray exposure....\\" Distribution Fragments of the Muonionalusta meteorite are held by numerous institutions around the world. *Geological Institute, Uppsala, . *Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna, 96 g. *Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, 82 g. *Max Planck Institute, Mainz, 96.3 g. *Paneth Collection (also at the Max Planck Institute), Mainz, 142.5 g. *National Museum of Natural History, Washington, 197 g. *American Museum of Natural History, New York, 84 g. *Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, 65.2 g. *University of California, Los Angeles, 55 g. *Vernadsky State Geological Museum, Moscow 2404 g. *Observatory and Planetarium Brno, Czech Republic, 21 kg. *Rahmi M.

Additionally, it is evaluated as momentum per unit time, corresponding to the product of mass flow rate and velocity, and therefore it has units of force. The momentum forces considered in open channel flow are dynamic force ‚Äì dependent of depth and flow rate ‚Äì and static force ‚Äì dependent of depth ‚Äì both affected by gravity. The principle of conservation of momentum in open channel flow is applied in terms of specific force, or the momentum function; which has units of length cubed for any cross sectional shape, or can be treated as length squared in the case of rectangular channels. Although not being technically correct, the term momentum will be used to replace the concept of the momentum function. The conjugate depth equation, which describes the depths on either side of a hydraulic jump, can be derived from the conservation of momentum in rectangular channels, based upon the relationship between momentum and depth of flow. The concept of momentum can also be applied to evaluate the thrust force on a sluice gate, a device that conserves specific energy but loses momentum. Derivation of the momentum function equation from momentum‚Äìforce balance In fluid dynamics, the momentum-force balance over a control volume is given by: :M_1 + M_2 = F_w + F_f + F_{P1} + F_{P2} Where: * M = momentum per unit time (ML/t2) * Fw = gravitational force due to weight of water (ML/t2) * Ff = force due to friction (ML/t2) * FP = pressure force (ML/t2) * subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively * Units: L = length, t = time, M = mass Applying the momentum-force balance in the direction of flow, in a horizontal channel (i.e. Fw = 0) and neglecting the frictional force (smooth channel bed and walls): :M_{1x} + M_{2x} = F_{P1x} + F_{P2x} Substituting the components of momentum per unit time and pressure force (with their respective positive or negative directions): :M_{1x} = \\\\dot{m}V_{1x} = - \\\\rho QV_1 \\\\quad and \\\\quad F_{P1x} = \\\\overline{P}_1A_1 :M_{2x} = \\\\dot{m}V_{2x} = - \\\\rho QV_2 \\\\quad and \\\\quad F_{P2x} = \\\\overline{P}_2A_2 The equation becomes: :-\\\\rho QV_1 + \\\\rho QV_2 = \\\\overline{P}_1A_1 - \\\\overline{P}_2A_2 Where: * \\\\dot{m} = mass flow rate (M/t) * œÅ = fluid density (M/L3) * Q = flow rate or discharge in the channel (L3/t) * V = flow velocity (L/t) * \\\\overline{P} = average pressure (M/Lt2) * A = cross sectional area of flow (L2) * subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively * Units: L (length); t (time); M (mass) The hydrostatic pressure distribution has a triangular shape from the water surface to the bottom of the channel (Figure 1). The average pressure can be obtained from the integral of the pressure distribution: : \\\\overline{P} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\rho gy Where: * y = flow depth (L) * g = gravitational constant (L/t2) Figure 1: Static Pressure Distribution Applying the continuity equation: :Q = V_1A_1 = V_2A_2 For the case of rectangular channels (i.e. constant width ‚Äúb‚Äù) the flow rate, Q, can be replaced by the unit discharge q, where q = Q/b, which yields: :q = V_1y_1 = V_2y_2 And therefore: :V_1 = q/y_1 \\\\quad and \\\\quad V_2 = q/y_2 By dividing the left and right side of the momentum-force equation by the channel‚Äôs width, and substituting the above relationships: :-{\\\\rho q \\\\left({q \\\\over {y_1}}\\\\right)} + {\\\\rho q \\\\left({q \\\\over {y_2}}\\\\right)} = \\\\left({1 \\\\over 2} \\\\rho g{y_1} \\\\right) {y_1} -{\\\\left({1 \\\\over 2} \\\\rho g{y_2} \\\\right) {y_2}} * subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively. Dividing through by œÅg: :-{{q^2 \\\\over g{y_1}}} + {q^2 \\\\over g{y_2}} = {{y_1} ^2 \\\\over 2}-{{y_2} ^2 \\\\over 2} Separating the variables based on the sides of the jump: :{{y_1} ^2 \\\\over 2}+{q^2 \\\\over g{y_1}} = {{y_2} ^2 \\\\over 2}+{q^2 \\\\over g{y_2}} In the above relationship both sides correspond to the specific force, or momentum function per channel width, also called Munit. :M_\\\\text{unit} = {y^2 \\\\over 2}+{q^2 \\\\over gy} This equation is only valid in certain unique circumstances, such as in a laboratory flume, where the channel is truly rectangular and the channel slope is zero or small. When this is the case, it is possible to assume that a hydrostatic pressure distribution applies. Munit is expressed in units of L2. If the channel width is known, the full specific force (L3) at a point can be determined by multiplying Munit by the width, b.  Hydraulic jumps and conservation of momentum  Figure 2 depicts a hydraulic jump. A hydraulic jump is a region of rapidly varied flow and is formed in a channel when a supercritical flow transitions into a subcritical flow.Henderson, F. M. (1966). Open Channel Flow, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, NY. This change in flow type is manifested as an abrupt change in the flow depth from the shallower, faster-moving supercritical flow to the deeper, slower-moving subcritical flow. Assuming no additional drag forces, momentum is conserved. A jump causes the water surface to rise abruptly, and as a result, surface rollers are formed, intense mixing occurs, air is entrained, and usually a large amount of energy is dissipated. For these reasons, in engineered systems a hydraulic jump is sometimes forced in an attempt to dissipate flow energy, to mix chemicals, or to act as an aeration device.Chaudhry, M. H. (2008). Open-Channel Flow, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, New York, NY.Sturm, T. W. (2010). Open Channel Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system of objects (which has no interactions with external agents) is constant.Finnemore, E. J., and Franzini, J. B. (2002). Fluid Mechanics with Engineering Applications, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY. Despite the fact that there is an energy loss, momentum across a hydraulic jump is still conserved. This means that the flow depth on either side of the jump will have the same momentum, and in this way, if the momentum and flow depth on either side of the jump is known, it is possible to determine the depth on the other side of the jump. These paired depths are known as sequent depths, or conjugate depths. The latter is valid unless the jump is caused by an external force or outside influence. Figure 2: Conservation of Momentum ‚Äì Hydraulic Jump The green box in Figure 2 represents the control volume enclosing the jump system and shows the major pressure forces on the system (FP1 and FP2). As this system is considered to be horizontal (or nearly horizontal) and frictionless, the horizontal components of force that normally exist due to friction (Ff) and the weight of water from a sloping channel (Fw) are neglected. It is worth to noting that the slope of the triangular hydrostatic pressure distributions on each location corresponds to the specific weight of water (Œ≥), which has units of (m/L2t2)  The M-y diagram  An M-y diagram is a plot of the depth of flow (y) versus momentum (M). In this case M does not refer to momentum (M/Lt2), but to the momentum function (L3 or L2). This produces a specific momentum curve that is generated by calculating momentum for a range of depth values and graphing the results. Each M-y curve is unique for a specific flowrate, Q, or unit discharge, q. The momentum on the x-axis of the plot can either have units of length3 (when using the general momentum function equation) or units of length2 (when using the rectangular form Munit equation). In a rectangular channel of unit width, an M-y curve is plotted using: :M_\\\\text{unit} = {q^2 \\\\over gy} + {y^2 \\\\over 2} Figure 3 depicts a sample M-y diagram showing the plots of four specific momentum curves. Each of these curves correspond to a specific q as noted in the figure. As unit discharge increases, the curve shifts to the right. Figure 3: M-y Curves for Various Unit Flowrates M-y diagrams can provide information about the characteristics and behavior of a certain discharge in a channel. Primarily, an M-y diagram will show which flow depths correspond to supercritical or subcritical flow for a given discharge, as well as defining the critical depth and critical momentum of a flow. In addition, M-y diagrams can aid in finding conjugate depths of flow that have the same specific force or momentum function, as in the case of flow depths on either side of a hydraulic jump. A dimensionless form of the M-y diagram representing any unit discharge can be created and utilized in place of the particular M-y curves discussed here and referred to in Figure 3.  Critical flow  A flow is termed critical if the bulk velocity of the flow V is equal to the propagation velocity of a shallow gravity wave \\\\sqrt {gy}.Chow, V. T. (1959). Open-Channel Hydraulics, McGraw- Hill, New York, NY. At critical flow, the specific energy and the specific momentum (force) are at a minimum for a given discharge. Figure 4 shows this relationship by showing a specific energy curve (E-y diagram) side-by-side to its corresponding specific momentum curve (M-y diagram) for a unit discharge q = 10 ft2/s. The green line on these figures intersects the curves at the minimum x-axis value that each curve exhibits. As noted, both of these intersections occur at a depth of approximately 1.46 ft, which is the critical flow depth for the specific conditions in the given channel. This critical depth represents the transition depth in the channel where the flow switches from supercritical flow to subcritical flow or vice versa. Figure 4: E-y & M-y Curves for a Rectangular Channel with q = 10 ft2/s In a rectangular channel, critical depth (yc) can also be found mathematically using the following equation: :y_c = \\\\left({q^2 \\\\over g} \\\\right)^{1 \\\\over 3} Where: * g = gravitational constant (L/t2) * q = unit flowrate or discharge ‚Äì for a rectangular channel, discharge per unit channel width (L2/t)  Supercritical flow versus subcritical flow on an M-y diagram  As mentioned before, an M-y diagram can provide an indication of flow classification for a given depth and discharge. When flow is not critical it is classified as either subcritical or supercritical. This distinction is based on the Froude number of the flow, which is the ratio of the bulk velocity (V) to the propagation velocity of a shallow wave :\\\\left({\\\\sqrt {gy}}\\\\right). The generic equation of the Froude number is expressed in terms of gravity (g), the flow‚Äôs velocity (V) and the hydraulic depth (A/B), where (A) represents the cross sectional area and (B) the top width. For rectangular channels, this ratio is equal to the depth of flow (y). :F_r={{V}\\\\over {\\\\sqrt{g \\\\left({A \\\\over B} \\\\right)}}}={{V}\\\\over {\\\\sqrt {gy}}} A Froude number greater than one is supercritical, and a Froude number less than one is subcritical. In general, supercritical flows are shallow and fast and subcritical flows are deep and slow. These different flow classifications are also represented on M-y diagrams where different regions of the graph represent different flow types. Figure 5 shows these regions, with a specific momentum curve corresponding to a q = 10 ft2/s. As stated previously, critical flow is represented by the minimum momentum that exists on the curve (green line). Supercritical flows correspond to any point on the momentum curve that has a depth less than the critical depth with subcritical flows having a depth greater than critical depth.French, R. H. (1985). Open- Channel Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill New York, NY. Figure 5: M-y Curve. Subcritical and Supercritical Regions for q = 10 ft2/s  Conjugate depths in a rectangular channel  Conjugate, or sequent, depths are the paired depths that result upstream and downstream of a hydraulic jump, with the upstream flow being supercritical and downstream flow being subcritical. Conjugate depths can be found either graphically using a specific momentum curve or algebraically with a set of equations. Because momentum is conserved over a hydraulic jump conjugate depths have equivalent momentum, and given a discharge, the conjugate to any flow depth can be determined with an M-y diagram (Figure 6). A vertical line that crosses the M-y curve twice (i.e. non-critical flow conditions) represents the depths on opposite sides of a hydraulic jump. Given sufficient momentum (momentum greater than critical flow), a conjugate depth pair exists at each point where the vertical line intersects the M-y curve. Figure 6 exemplifies this behavior with a momentum of 10 ft2 for a unit discharge of 10 ft2/s. This momentum line crosses the M-y curve at depths of 0.312 (y1) and 4.31 feet (y2). Depth y1 corresponds to the supercritical depth upstream of the jump and depth y2 corresponds to the subcritical depth downstream of the jump. Conjugate depths can also be calculated using the Froude number and depth of either the supercritical or subcritical flow. The following equations can be used to determine the conjugate depth to a known depth in a rectangular channel: :y_2 = {y_1 \\\\over 2} \\\\left(-1 + \\\\sqrt{(1 + 8{F_{r_1}}^2)}\\\\right) \\\\quad or \\\\quad y_1 = {y_2 \\\\over 2} \\\\left(-1 + \\\\sqrt{(1 + 8{F_{r_2}}^2)} \\\\right) Figure 6: M-y Diagram for q = 10 ft2/s Showing Conjugate Depths Corresponding to a Momentum of 10 ft2  Derivation of conjugate depth equation for a rectangular channel  Start with the conservation of momentum function M_1 = M_2, for rectangular channels: :\\\\left({q^2 \\\\over gy_1} + {y_1^2 \\\\over 2} \\\\right) = \\\\left({q^2 \\\\over gy_2} + {y_2^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) Where: * q = discharge per unit channel width (L2/t) * g = gravitational constant (L/t2) * y = flow depth (L) * subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively. Isolate the q2 terms on one side of the equal sign with the y^2 terms on the other side: :{q^2 \\\\over gy_1} - {q^2 \\\\over gy_2} = -{y_1^2 \\\\over 2} + {y_2^2 \\\\over 2} Factor the constant terms q2/g and 1/2: :{q^2 \\\\over g} \\\\left({1 \\\\over y_1} - {1 \\\\over y_2}\\\\right) = {1 \\\\over 2} ({y_2^2} - {y_1^2}) Combine the depth terms on the left side and expand the quadratic on the right side: :{q^2 \\\\over g} \\\\left({{y_2 - y_1} \\\\over {y_1y_2}} \\\\right) = {1 \\\\over 2} ({y_2 - y_1})({y_2 + y_1}) Divide by (y_2 - y_1): :{q^2 \\\\over g} \\\\left({1 \\\\over {y_1y_2}} \\\\right) = {1 \\\\over 2}({y_2 + y_1}) Recall from continuity in a rectangular channel that: :q = V_1y_1 = V_2y_2 Substitute V_1y_1 into the left side of the equation for q: :{{V_1^2y_1^2} \\\\over {gy_1y_2}} = {{V_1^2y_1} \\\\over {gy_2}} = {{y_2 + y_1} \\\\over 2} Divide by {y_1/y_2}: :{{V_1^2} \\\\over {g}} = {{y_2({y_2 + y_1})} \\\\over {2y_1}} Divide by y_1 and recognize that the left hand side is now equal to Fr12: :{{V_1^2} \\\\over {gy_1}} = {{y_2({y_2 + y_1})} \\\\over {2y_1^2}} \\\\Rightarrow {V_1^2 \\\\over gy_1} = F_{r_1}^2 = {y_2^2 \\\\over {2y_1^2}} + {{y_2y_1} \\\\over 2y_1^2} = {y_2^2 \\\\over {2y_1^2}} + {{y_2} \\\\over 2y_1} Rearrange and set the equation equal to zero: :0 = {y_2^2 \\\\over {2y_1^2}} + {{y_2} \\\\over 2y_1} - F_{r_1}^2 To facilitate the next step, let x = {y_2/y_1}, and the above equation becomes: :0 = {1 \\\\over {2}}x^2 + {1 \\\\over {2}}x - F_{r_1}^2 Solve for x using the quadratic equation with a = {1/2}, b = {1/2}, and c = -Fr12: :x=\\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad x = {y_2 \\\\over y_1} = \\\\frac{-{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {{1 \\\\over 2}^2-4\\\\left({1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)\\\\left(-F_{r_1}^2\\\\right)}}{2\\\\left({1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right)} = \\\\frac{-{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {{1 \\\\over 4}+2{F_{r_1}^2}}}{1} Pull out the 1/4 inside of the square root: :{y_2 \\\\over y_1} = -{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {{1 \\\\over 4} \\\\left(1+8{F_{r_1}^2}\\\\right)} = -{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\pm {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\sqrt {\\\\left(1+8{F_{r_1}^2}\\\\right)} Focus on the root with the positive second term: : {y_2 \\\\over y_1} = -{1 \\\\over 2} + {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\sqrt {\\\\left(1+8{F_{r_1}^2}\\\\right)} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad y_2 = -{y_1 \\\\over 2} + {y_1 \\\\over 2} \\\\sqrt {\\\\left(1+8{F_{r_1}^2}\\\\right)} Factor the (y1/2) terms: :y_2 = {y_1 \\\\over 2} \\\\left(-1 + \\\\sqrt {\\\\left(1+8{F_{r_1}^2}\\\\right)}\\\\right) The above is the conjugate depth equation in a rectangular channel and can be used to find the subcritical or supercritical depth from known conditions, either upstream (y1, Fr1) or downstream (y2, Fr2).  A note on conjugate depths versus alternative depths  It is important not to confuse conjugate depths (between which momentum is conserved) with alternate depths (between which energy is conserved). In the case of a hydraulic jump, the flow experiences a certain amount of energy headloss so that the subcritical flow downstream of the jump contains less energy than the supercritical flow upstream of the jump. Alternate depths are valid over energy conserving devices such as sluice gates and conjugate depths are valid over momentum conserving devices such as hydraulic jumps. Application of the momentum function equation to evaluate the thrust force on a sluice gate The momentum equation can be applied to determine the force exerted by water on a sluice gate (Figure 7). Contrary to the conservation of fluid energy when a flow encounters a sluice gate, the momentum upstream and downstream of the gate is not conserved. The thrust force exerted by water on a gate placed in a rectangular channel can be obtained from the following equation, which can be derived in the same way as the conservation of momentum equation for rectangular channels: :F_\\\\text{thrust-gate} = \\\\gamma b(\\\\Delta M) = \\\\gamma b(M_\\\\text{unit,1} - M_\\\\text{unit,2}) Where: * Fthrust-gate = force exerted by water on the sluice gate (ML/t2) * Œ≥ = specific weight of water (M/L2t2) *ŒîMunit = difference in momentum per unit width between the upstream and downstream sides of the sluice gate (L2). Figure 7: Force on a Sluice Gate (simplified version) = Example = Water is flowing through a smooth, frictionless, rectangular channel at a rate of 100.0 cfs. The width of the channel is 10.0 ft. The flow depth upstream of the sluice gate was measured to be 16.3 ft with a corresponding alternate depths of 0.312 ft. The water temperature was measured to be 70 ¬∞F. What is the thrust force on the gate? Applying the momentum per unit width equation to the upstream and downstream locations respectively: :M_\\\\text{unit} = {{y^2}\\\\over 2}+{{q^2}\\\\over gy} :M_\\\\text{unit,1}= {{{y_1}^2}\\\\over 2}+{{q^2}\\\\over gy_1} = {{{16.3}^2}\\\\over 2} +{{{\\\\left({100\\\\over10}\\\\right)}^2}\\\\over{(32.2)(16.3)}} :M_\\\\text{unit,1}= 132 \\\\quad ft^2 and :M_\\\\text{unit,2}= 10 \\\\quad ft^2 The specific weight of water at 70 ¬∞F is 62.30 {lb/ft^3}.

David M. Kennedy (born 1958) is a criminologist, professor, action researcher, and author specializing in crime prevention among inner city gangs, especially in the prevention of violent acts among street gangs. Kennedy developed the Operation Ceasefire group violence intervention in Boston in the 1990s and the High Point Model drug market intervention in High Point, North Carolina, in 2003, which have proven to reduce violence and eliminate overt drug markets in jurisdictions around the United States. He founded the National Network for Safe Communities in 2009 to support cities using these and related strategies. He is the author of two books, Don't Shoot: One Man, A Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America (2011), a popular treatment of his violence reduction work with street gangs, and Deterrence and Crime Prevention: Reconsidering the Prospect of Sanction (2008), a theoretical publication. He is the coauthor of Beyond 911: A New Era for Policing, a book on community policing. Biography =Education= David M. Kennedy graduated from Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts and high honors in philosophy and history. In 2011, his alma mater awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. =Career= During the 1980s Kennedy worked as a case writer in the Case Program of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While visiting the Nickerson Gardens neighborhood of Los Angeles on an assignment, he became acutely aware of ravages of the crack epidemic and gang-related violence on poor communities of color in the United States. This initial experience inspired his lifelong commitment to combating these problems. In the mid-1990s, as part of the Boston Gun Project, Kennedy and colleagues Anthony A. Braga and Anne M. Piehl from Harvard worked in Boston to apply new problem- oriented policing ideas to Boston's violence epidemic. Through working with the Boston Police Department gang unit, Kennedy and his colleagues came to understand that gangs were at the heart of the problem and that an extremely small number of highly active offenders was responsible for a majority of the city's serious crime problem, a principle that has informed his interventions ever since. Together with Boston law enforcement, city officials, community and faith leaders, and street outreach workers, Kennedy and his colleagues developed the ‚Äúcall-in,‚Äù a face-to-face meeting with gang members in a forum setting, during which this partnership of city stakeholders \\"clearly communicates (1) a credible, moral message against violence; (2) a credible law enforcement message about the group consequences of further violence; and (3) a genuine offer of help for those who want it.\\" The immediate result of Operation Ceasefire was a 63 percent reduction in youth homicide and a 30 percent reduction in homicide citywide, what has been called the \\"Boston Miracle.\\" The call-in and other forms of direct communication with active offenders remain the central features of the Group Violence Intervention and Kennedy's overall approach to reducing violence and community disorder. One important element of the call-in message is that it provides what Kennedy calls an \\"honorable exit\\" from violence and the street code that promotes it, \\"a way to step back without losing face.\\" After the initial success in Boston, Kennedy found stakeholders in Minneapolis willing to replicate his research and he led another successful implementation of the still developing strategy. Next, he assisted Stockton, California, and Baltimore, among other cities. The Baltimore intervention, begun in 1998, proved to be a particular challenge and highlighted some of the difficulties of implementation, especially in working with rival political officials and sustaining the strategy. After an initial decline in violence, the project faced political resistance and came to a halt. In Baltimore, Kennedy also began to refine the terminology used within the strategy: Kennedy uses the term \\"group\\" rather than \\"gang\\" because all gangs are groups, but not all groups are gangs. His research has found that many high-rate offenders associate in groups - such as neighborhood cliques, sets, or drug crews - that do not fit the statutory definition of a gang or share such characteristics as a name, common symbols, signs or tags, an identifiable hierarchy, or other identifiers. Using the principles developed in his previous research, Kennedy began to craft an approach to eliminating overt drug markets, a problem poisoning America's most troubled communities and driving violence. \\"It's not about the drugs,\\" writes Kennedy, \\"it's about the drug market. Drug use doesn't cause much violence, much public chaos. It can be very bad...But the community can handle that. It's the street scene that tears the community apart.\\" He theorized an approach to eliminating drug markets that would combine formal and informal social control, using call-ins to communicate an antidealing message from community leaders and a promise of swift, certain sanctions from law enforcement. High Point, North Carolina, a city already using Kennedy's approach to reduce violence, was the first to pilot the new strategy for eliminating its overt drug markets. As in the Group Violence Intervention, Kennedy designed a strategy for High Point to focus on the core population driving the problem. High Point law enforcement arrested the small number of dangerous drug dealers, those with a history of violent offenses. Law enforcement built prosecutable cases on the dozen or so remaining dealers and \\"banked\\" the cases, or held them unless the dealer continued dealing. At call-ins, the banked case allowed law enforcement to put the dealer on notice that any known future dealing would result in immediate arrest and prosecution and community representatives communicated clear standards against overt dealing and violence. The Drug Market Intervention in High Point closed the city's overt markets with no sign of displacement. The city saw a 44 to 56 percent reduction in Part 1 Uniform Crime Reports data in three out of four neighborhoods that implemented the strategy and a four to 74 percent reduction in drug offenses in all four neighborhoods. The strategy has now been widely and successfully replicated throughout the U.S. Within the Drug Market Intervention, Kennedy also developed the concept of \\"racial reconciliation\\" necessary to heal relations between law enforcement and communities of color before their collaborative work could proceed. \\"The real issue was the way the relationship between the police and community was being poisoned by toxic racial narrative,‚Äù Kennedy has written. In his work, Kennedy points out that law enforcement and communities have fundamental misunderstandings about one another. He notes that many in communities of color, especially poor black communities, have experienced state-sanctioned police oppression within living memory, and that they believe current enforcement practices such as street stops, drug arrests, and mass incarceration to be a deliberate conspiracy against black communities and an extension of this history. Law enforcement, on the other hand, does not hear the community objecting to violence and drug markets and often believes that the community likes what's going on, is living off drug money, has lost its morality, or does not care enough to work for change. While both viewpoints are incorrect, says Kennedy, they make collaboration impossible. However, Kennedy believes that law enforcement and communities share important aims and common ground and that when they can meet and both acknowledge past harms and the ineffectiveness of their current positions, they can make progress toward eliminating not only violence and overt drug markets, but intrusive and damaging law enforcement practices, as well. High Point was the first site of formalized meetings to put the racial reconciliation process into practice and these powerful meetings laid the groundwork for the effective intervention. The process of racial reconciliation was also the subject of a national U.S. Department of Justice working session in 2012 and has been a topic of increasing interest for communities and law enforcement agencies nationwide. Kennedy currently directs a research center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, a position he has held since 2005. In 2009, Kennedy and John Jay College President Jeremy Travis founded the National Network for Safe Communities to link cities using Kennedy's strategies to reduce violence, minimize arrest and incarceration, improve legitimacy, and strengthen relationships between law enforcement and distressed communities. Through the National Network for Safe Communities, Kennedy is currently assisting numerous cities to implement the Group Violence Intervention, including Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Baltimore, MD; New Orleans, LA; Baton Rouge, LA; South Bend, IN; Chattanooga, TN; and three cities in the state of Connecticut. Kennedy also remains a professor of criminal justice in the Criminal Justice Department of John Jay College. Kennedy and his work have been profiled in New Yorker, National Public Radio, 60 Minutes, and the Dylan Ratigan Show. His distinctions include receiving two Webber Seavey awards from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, two Innovations in American Government awards from the Kennedy School of Government, and a Herman Goldstein Problem-Oriented Policing Award. Over his years of practice, Kennedy has influenced the approaches to drug enforcement by the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He has spoken to many organizations, including the United States Congress, Scotland Yard, the National District Attorneys' Association, and the United States Conference of Mayors. =Personal life= Kennedy lives in Brooklyn, New York. Author =Don't Shoot: One Man, a Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America= Published 2011, Kennedy's Don't Shoot: One Man, a Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America describes the development of Operation Ceasefire, also commonly known as the Group Violence Intervention, which he and colleagues introduced in Boston, Massachusetts to combat gang-related violence in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods. The program has three components. Recognized gang members would be brought in under probation or parole authority, and given an opportunity to listen to concerned members of their own community express their desire for the violence to stop. Social workers would offer services to help them detach from the cycle of violence, and the police would assure them that each gang that continued to engage in violence, starting with the most violent, would be effectively targeted and removed from the streets. They were asked to relay this threefold message to their fellow gang members. Recognizing that the gang members were arming themselves because of the escalating violence and the fears they had for their safety, the police pledged to react strongly to any threats against those cooperating with the effort. The success of the program has been acknowledged. Kennedy's principles are being applied in other cities suffering from highly violent gang activity among their youngsters. Other cities are studying the program and devising ways to implement it in their communities. Publisher Weekly review of David M. Kennedy, Don't Shoot: One Man, a Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America The book has been reviewed in The New Republic, where it was characterized as a \\"page-turner\\" despite being an essentially academic publication. Benjamin Wallace-Wells, \\"Crews Control\\" , The New Republic, 6 Oct 2011. Review of David M. Kennedy, Don't Shoot. =Deterrence and Crime Prevention: Reconsidering the Prospect of Sanction= Published in 2008, Kennedy's Deterrence and Crime Prevention: Reconsidering the Prospect of Sanction is a theoretical work that provides an overview of deterrence approaches to preventing crime and forwards a new deterrence framework based on Kennedy's work reducing gang violence and eliminating overt drug markets. On traditional deterrence models, Kennedy writes, \\"Deterrence is at the heart of the preventive aspiration of criminal justice. Deterrence, whether through preventive patrol by police officers or stiff prison sentences for violent offenders, is the principal mechanism through which the central feature of criminal justice, the exercise of state authority, works -- it is hoped -- to diminish offending and enhance public safety. And however well we think deterrence works, it clearly often does not work nearly as well as we would like ‚Äì and often at very great cost.\\" Kennedy identifies that a small number of high rate offenders commit the vast majority of serious crime in a community and theorizes a new framework for deterrence, through which law enforcement and community leaders engage directly with these offenders to deliver particular deterrence messages to them. Law enforcement is to give the offenders clear information about sanctions and put them on prior notice that specific criminal acts will be met in the future with special law enforcement attention. Community members deliver a credible moral message to the offenders that the community demands an end to the specific criminal act. Kennedy argues that groups rather than individuals should often be the focus of deterrence messaging. This new framework for deterrence, Kennedy argues, will reduce offending by enhancing both formal legal sanctions and informal social control. The book summarizes its arguments as follows: * many of the ways in which we seek to deter crime in fact facilitate offending; * simple steps such as providing clear information to offenders could transform deterrence; * communities may be far more effective than legal authorities in deterring crime; * apparently minor sanctions can deter more effectively than draconian ones; * groups, rather than individual offenders, should often be the focus of deterrence; * existing legal tools can be used in unusual but greatly more effective ways; * even serious offenders can be reached through deliberate moral engagement; * authorities, communities, and offenders - no matter how divided - share and can occupy hidden common ground. The book gives the example of High Point, North Carolina, a city in which this deterrence framework successfully reduced gang-related violence and eliminated overt drug markets. Kennedy further theorizes that this framework has potential to deter the most serious domestic violence offending. Awards David M. Kennedy received the 2011 Hatfield Scholar Award for scholarship in the public interest.

It is located west-southwest of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. It was closed in 1972. History =World War II= An airfield at Raco was built prior to World War II. Its use was likely to provide air service to the locks at Sault Sainte Marie. It was apparently acquired by the United States Government after the Pearl Harbor Attack and expanded through lease, license, easements and by fee of different tracts of land. A small airfield with three 5,520' x 300' runways was constructed in a triangle pattern. A large number of dispersal points were built in a forested area to the west of the airfield, and a few support buildings were also erected in the woods. After construction, the airfield was designated Raco Auxiliary Airfield, and was designated a Sub-Base of the Air Transport Command Alpena Army Airfield. The mission of Raco AAF was to serve as a refueling stop for aircraft headed for Alaska as well as to defend the locks of Sault Ste. Marie. However, no Air Force tactical units were assigned there during the war and the few support personnel who were stationed there were under the command of the 4250th Army Air Force Base Unit at Alpena AAF. The United States Navy may have assigned some aviation personnel to the base as well. The base was inactive beginning in 1945, and after the end of World War II, the airfield was closed. =United States Army use= After the war, the United States Army retained ownership to the Raco site and used it as an anti-aircraft artillery site. Two former taxiways to the west of the runways were turned into roads, and over two dozen aircraft dispersal pads were modified into round artillery pads where 75-mm Skysweeper anti-aircraft guns were located. The guns were used to provide an air defense against incoming aircraft flying at low altitudes to attack the entrance of the Soo locks & shipping narrows. Peak deployment for Skysweeper battalions at Raco was achieved in the mid-1950s when 8 battalions were deployed. As more and more Nike Ajax missile sites came online and the USAF Air Defense Command fighter-interceptor K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base became operational in 1956, the US Army Air Defense Command (ARAACOM) reduced the number of batteries and eventually the site was closed at the end of 1957. =BOMARC Missile base= 100px After the Army vacated the property, the Air Force began construction of an Air Defense Command CIM-10 Bomarc missile site to the east of the airfield. The supersonic Bomarc missiles were the first long-range anti-aircraft missiles in the world. They were capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. Their intended role in defense was in an intrusion prevention perimeter. Bomarcs aligned on the eastern and western coasts of North America theoretically would launch and would destroy enemy bombers before the bombers could drop their payloads on industrial regions. The 37th Air Defense Missile Squadron (BOMARC) was activated on 1 March 1960 with 28 CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missiles (SAM). The missile facility was known as the Kincheloe AFB BOMARC site, consisting of a rectangular installation, just southeast of the old runways. It operated the 2nd-generation IM-99B version of the BOMARC missile. About 40 personnel were stationed at the BOMARC site. The missiles remained on alert until they were inactivated on 31 July 1972. Current use After the Air Force closed the missile site in 1972, the facility was transferred to the United States Forest Service. It is now managed as part of the Hiawatha National Forest and leased to Smithers-RAPRA for use as a winter automotive testing facility. The facility is known as the \\"Smithers Winter Test Center\\"; a cold-weather testing site for vehicles and components in harsh winter climatic conditions. The test site features over 750 acres of snow, ice (approximately 40 acres) and bare pavement surfaces and is staffed by more than 40 employees proficient in creating and maintaining a variety of snow, ice, and dry area surfaces. The Test Center is used by manufacturers of vehicles ranging from small automobiles to Class 8 trucks, vehicle components (both OE and aftermarket), snow handling equipment, construction equipment, recreational and seasonal sport vehicles and military equipment. Smithers Winter Test Center has 17 separate testing areas for testing all types of vehicles and components.

Its goal is to reduce poverty through both development initiatives and family planning programs. Originally called the Community-Based Family Planning Service, it was founded by Mechai Viravaidya in 1974. In the early 1970s, Viravaidya was the Minister of Industry but became frustrated with the government's inability to implement a national family planning policy. In his work with the government, he identified a direct correlation between Thailand's poverty and population growth. His immediate concern was the high population growth rate of 3.2%, which equated to approximately seven children per family. The population growth rate was an increasing concern for Thailand and Mechai Viravaidya because high growth rates restricted Thailand's ability to provide for its entire population and improve living conditions. By 2011, Thailand's population growth rate was only 0.566%. A sharp reduction in poverty has followed upon the reduction in family size, a reduction which can in significant part be attributed to the influence and programs of the PDA. The Population and Community Development Association has concentrated on reaching rural towns and villages with family planning and development programs. It has operated on the belief that ‚Äúlocal people are best suited to shape and sustain their own development.‚Äù Most of its programs empower communities on a micro level, utilizing a ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù approach. As of 2009, the PDA had 18 regional centers which ran development programs in one-third of the country. Today, the organization consists of over 800 employees and 12,000 volunteers and is one of Thailand's most expansive and diverse NGOs. Initially, the PDA sought to reduce population growth by focusing on efforts both to combat child mortality and to encourage family planning. Viravaidya deduced that family planning would not be widely adopted in Thailand if children did not survive. Therefore, his solution to controlling population growth, which was at 3.3%, was to target maternal and child healthcare. At the same time, the PDA made various methods of birth control accessible to rural populations. The PDA discovered that birth control pills were used by only 20% of the population because getting them required access to medical personnel. To target the remaining 80% of the country, the PDA invested in multiple initiatives - including the popularization of free condoms, increased access to birth control, incentives for women to not become pregnant, and slogans to encourage smaller families. The Thai family planning programs met notable success. By 2015, total fertility had dropped to 1.5 children per woman. Following on the drop in unwanted fertility, the poverty rate dropped sharply; from 32.4% in 2003 10.9% in 2013. Mission and purpose The original mission of the Population and Community Association was to supplement the efforts of the Thai government to reduce poverty by promoting family planning. To accomplish this, the PDA has focused on targeting remote rural communities where government outreach has not been viable. Realizing that a high population growth rate is a barrier to economic development, the PDA's focus has been on implementing family planning programs to lower the population growth rate. It has sought to do so through community-based, participatory approaches to educate and empower village residents. Since its inception, the program mission has expanded to include rural development and the improvement of overall health conditions. Engaging in a \\"people-centered approach,\\" the PDA has worked to empower communities to identify its own needs and then work to improve conditions based on those needs - a form of self-help. Today, the PDA works to address a multitude of issues that affect poverty levels. Some of these activities include: health care, HIV/AIDS services and awareness, access to clean water resources, reliable means of income, environmental conservation, gender equality, youth education and services, democratic engagement, and small-scale business initiatives, including village owned banks providing micro-credit loans. Founder Mechai Viravaidya in 2008 Mechai Viravaidya founded the Population and Community Development Association in 1974, at which time it was named the Community-Based Family Planning Service. He began his work with rural communities in Thailand in 1965 when he returned to Thailand from studying at the University of Melbourne in Australia. After studying he got a job working for the National Economic and Social Development Board and later became the Minister of Industry. As part of his job, Mechai Viravaidya spent time visiting rural areas of Thailand. Relative to other government officials, he spent a lot of time in discussion with villagers and farmers. Viravaidya then began writing a weekly column that was published in a Bangkok newspaper. He also taught at Thammasat University and had a nightly radio show during the same time period. Later he played a leading role on a television soap opera series. These experiences helped him gain the attention of the media and the support of a wide variety of audiences. When the Thai government created a national family planning policy, Viravaidya worked as secretary-general of the Family Planning Association of Thailand for two years. Viravaidya then switched to the non-profit sector when he founded the CBFPS in 1974. Today, Viravaidya continues to work as chairman of the PDA. Timeline The Population and Community Development Association was established in 1976 as a response to the need for a diversified approach to poverty reduction in Thailand. Originally the organization was called the Community-Based Family Planning Service (CBFPS) which was established in 1974. Two years later, the CBFPS became a sub-agency within the PDA. Several other sub-agencies and separate associations have been created since then: 1974 - established as the Community-Based Family Planning Service (CBFPS) 1975 - Population & Development Company (PDC) created as a separate business to fulfill fundraising needs 1976 - CBFPS renamed as the Population and Community Development Association (PDA) 1978 - Community-Based Appropriate Technology Development Services (CBATDS) created as a sub-agency 1978 - Asian Center for Population & Community Development (ACPD) established as a separate international organization 1979 - Community-Based Emergency Relief Services (CBERS) created as a sub-agency 1979 - Community Based Integrated Rural Development (CBIRD) created a sub-agency 1983 - Community-Based Incentives- Thailand (CBIT) created as a sub-agency 1983 - Population and Development International (PDI) established as a separate organization 1984 - Rural Small Scale Industries (RSSI) Company was created as a separate business 1989 - The Thai Business Initiative in Rural Development (TBIRD) created as a sub-agency Funding The PDA is funded through several different sources. Most of its funding comes from international donors, other NGOs and foundations, private sector businesses and foreign governments. The establishment of the original organization was funded by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. However, as the organization grew it diversified its funding and currently does not rely solely on international donors for continuous aid. Instead it has utilized various methods to work towards financial self-sustainability. In 1975, Viravaidya received a loan which he used to start a business that is legally separate from the PDA. This business has expanded into 16 separate companies under the Population and Community Development Company Ltd. These companies complement the work of the PDA by providing services such as health and medicine supplies and affordable restaurant food with a condom theme (known as Cabbages and Condoms). The profits from these companies are then used to help offset the PDA costs. Also, it can be used to supplement funds when donor aid is limited and to expand existing PDA services and programs. In the past, funds from these separate businesses have accounted for as much as 70% of required financing to maintain existing PDA activity. As a response to an overall decline of foreign development aid, the Thai Business Initiative for Rural Development (TBIRD) was created in 1989. Strategies The Population and Community Development Association has used many different strategies to promote its programs. Often the strategies are considered unique or creative. Some of these strategies include: Efforts to make condoms more accessible & remove the stigma associated with them, like * Holding condom balloon blowing competitions * Creating a Captain Condom mascot * Making condoms available at associated Cabbages & Condoms restaurants in lieu of mints * Educating children in school * Having Buddhist monks sprinkle holy water on condoms * Overseeing a \\"Condom is the Girl's Best Friend\\" campaign * Having police officers distribute condoms in a \\"Cops and Rubbers\\" program Encouraging vasectomies by * Making donations into a community fund for every vasectomy performed * Holding a vasectomy lunch for Americans in Thailand Increasing the availability of birth control pills * By utilizing floating markets to provide contraceptives/birth control pill * By training of local shopkeepers to prescribe birth control pill Educating the population about HIV/AIDS * By using of military radio stations Encouraging development * By making micro-loans available to general villagers at relatively low interest rates, especially for villages that use contraceptives * By creating village banks operated by (mostly) women within the village community Relationship with Thai government Throughout its existence, the PDA has involved the government of Thailand in its activities. Viravaidya largely attributes the success of the PDA in reducing population growth in Thailand to the strong cooperation between the non-profit sector and the government. In 1971 the Thai government instituted a national family planning policy. Viravaidya was the secretary-general in the National Family Planning Association of Thailand, which worked to implement the government created policy. However, its impact was limited and Virvaidya went on to form the organization Community-Based Family Planning Service (CBFPS) in 1974, which later became incorporated under the broader PDA. Overall, the government has been supportive of the PDA and its programs. Before beginning a new program or spreading to a new town, the PDA consults with the local government agency. It partners with the government in order to target and serve rural communities that the government does not have the capacity reach. Furthermore, the reduction in Thailand's population growth rate has largely been aided by the government's efforts to establish and maintain a national family planning policy. Also, the Ministry of Public Health adopted family planning into its national health service and led the way for the distribution of contraceptives by non-physicians. Both the PDA and the public acknowledge the successes of the Thai government and the National Family Planning Program in aiding family planning services. Services =Women's health and maternity= Empowering women's reproductive health ultimately advocates for eliminating gender inequalities. This increases women's socio-economic participation, consequently alleviating poverty in developing states. The PDA recognized that educating women on family planning and reproductive health created the following benefits: providing women the agency to make decisions about family planning, improving couples communication, and modifying sexual behaviors. The PDA encourages smaller families given that the benefits have direct economic repercussions. Families can reallocate resources previously spent on providing for their dependents and increase their savings. This additional income thereby becomes more likely to be invested in the health and education of their children. Additionally, women are more likely to join the paying work force if they are not restricted to the home and childcare. Given women's influence capacity within the home and community, the PDA tailors its family planning initiatives toward women. Unwanted pregnancies In Thailand, abortion is illegal with severe offense and punishment if convicted. Only in extremely rare cases are women permitted to have an abortion with no offense. Consequently, there were no professional clinics available to provide safe services for unwanted pregnancies for Thai women. A study published by the Population Council of New York released the following statistic: in 1978, 310,000 induced abortions occurred in Thailand at a rate of 37 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44. This statistic could be attributed to Thai women's restricted access to contraceptives, resources/services, and basic information regarding family planning. Due to the legal consequences, women turned to doctors operating illegally and \\"back alley\\" operations to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Many women who sought out these means of abortion died directly from the procedure or later from contracted complications and infections. Mechai and the PDA acknowledged the growing need for safe services and information in regards to unwanted pregnancies. However, the PDA faced two major dilemmas in providing such resources ‚Äì financing such an initiative and operating within the law. The solution was a loan of one million baht from International Pregnancy Advisory Service (IPAS) endorsing a separate legal entity, a comprehensive clinic, from the PDA. The clinic provides safe services to terminate pregnancies and is operated by professional staff. The PDA is able to organize this clinic under a protective policy, which permits such services within legal safety boundaries. Couples are counseled and thoroughly informed of family planning practices. Contraceptives are advised and supplied. This clinic enables choice for women ‚Äì no abortive procedures may be done without complete consent from the woman. Thai women were previously unable to obtain safe termination services mostly due to financial restrictions. The PDA recognizes this constraint and actively works to make the clinic accessible for everyone that requires its services. Charges for abortion procedures are minimal or negotiable depending on the recipient and her specific circumstances. The medical professional staff offers their time and services at a reasonable hourly rate rather than by procedure. For women whom cannot afford the procedure not access to the clinic, the PDA offers to cover both their services and transportation fees to and from the clinic. The clinic does not profit monetarily from its services and clientele. Any additional revenue generated is either put towards repaying the IPAS loan or investing into the clinic itself. The PDA is committed to making termination procedures, counseling, information, and contraceptives widely accessible and affordable for everyone, especially women. In 1982, a second clinic was opened in Chiang Rai. This was the first operation of its kind to be located in Thailand's rural provinces. In 1985, Bangkok opened two clinics, but these were eventually shut down in 1987. In 1989, two more clinics were established, one in Chiang Mai and the other in Nakhon Ratchasima. The most recent clinic was created in Phitsanuloke in 2002. =HIV and AIDS= In September 1984, Thailand reported its first case of AIDS. Unlike the common stigmatized association of AIDS with homosexual communities, HIV/AIDS in developing nations is also a heterosexual problem. In Thailand, individuals at risk for HIV/AIDS were exposed to the virus via their husbands, by continual sex partners, or by the sex trade industry. Thailand identified six main high-risk groups for contracting HIV/AID: homosexuals, injecting drug users (IUDs), sex workers, individuals receiving blood transfusions, other heterosexuals, and infants whose mothers are HIV carriers. At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, Thailand was ranked second only to Africa in its number of reported AIDS cases. In 1997, UNAIDS (United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) released the following statistics: * 770,000 adults and 14,000 children in Thailand were reported HIV-positive * predictions forecast that 30 of 10,000 children have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS by 1999 The PDA released additionally alarming statistics about the spread of HIV and the growing prevalence of AIDS in Thailand: the percentage of HIV positives in the Thai population was at 4% in December 1987 and by September 1988 had risen to 43% (a span of nine months) The Thai government did not address the AIDS epidemic. Mechai Viravaidya believed that the government's lack of influence and assistance in the AIDS epidemic within Thailand required action by someone. Viravaidya assigned himself and the PDA to the task of addressing the HIV/AIDS and called upon everyone in the nation to become involved. The PDA believes that the affected population group is fully capable of advocating for themselves if given the enabling resources and support by all sectors of Thai society. The PDA addressed the AIDS epidemic with a three part strategy: * Create and circulate educational materials to communicate with the masses * Educate other similar organization to PDA to enact parallel strategies to fight and treat AIDS * Advocacy In 1987, the PDA launched an educational strategy to increase awareness of AIDS in Thailand. The PDA constructed five target groups: government officials, community leaders, youths, commercial sex workers, and women. The underlying initiative of the educational awareness launch was to enable and empower the target groups to advocate behavioral changes in Thailand to avoid infecting the entire population. In 1990, Viravaidya released a statement remarking, ‚ÄúWe [Thailand] have no high risk groups, we only have high risk nationality.‚Äù Since the onset of the AIDS epidemic in Thailand, the PDA has established 45 initiatives to educate and prevent HIV/AIDS. The PDA takes the position of HIV/AIDS as a behavioral issue within Thai society rather than an infectious disease. From this standpoint, the PDA adopts an advocate model for its fight against HIV/AIDS, thereby encouraging empowerment for at risk individuals to secure their own health through positive sexual behaviors and practices. The implementation of these programs has had enormous benefits for the Thai population. The United Nations reported that new cases of HIV had been reduced by 90%. The World Bank reported 7.7 million lives were saved. The PDA reported that their total spent funds on the HIV/AIDS campaign is 62,329,590 Baht. Viravaidya and the PDA turned to the Royal Thai Army for support where the government was unwilling and unable in their HIV/AIDS campaign. The government receives criticism for its passive actions towards the sex tourism industry, where HIV/AIDS is prevalent and most likely to spread. The military was cooperative with Viravaidya and the PDA's requests to utilize its broadcasting capacity to reach the masses. The Army permitted the PDA the use of 326 radio stations to broadcast nationwide a three-year HIV/AIDS educational campaign. The Army then took an even more active role in the fight against AIDS by removing the stigma from HIV positive recruits by permitting a continuation of service within the Army for HIV positive soldiers. The PDA created the Corporate Education Program to incorporate the business sector into their HIV/AIDS campaign. The enrollment for this initiative is over 100 companies. The PDA trains and educates personnel from different companies about HIV/AIDS. These representatives then relay the training back to their own companies and provide resources and information to HIV positive employees. The PDA asks participating companies to utilize their networks to further spread information and advocacy for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The PDA's most widely accessible initiative is its Mobile Anonymous HIV Testing Clinic. It provides free HIV and STD testing by public health-care providers. Additionally, it provides counseling services for infected and/or affected individuals. PDA has touring buses equipped with TVs and information handouts. These buses constantly play clips about education, prevention, and agency for HIV/AIDS ‚Äì thereby eliminating any barriers of communication for illiteracy and low socio-economic individuals. A large and publicized component of the PDA's HIV/AIDS campaign is Viravaidya's initiative to desensitize the condom. The rationale behind the condom movement is that if Thai society can widely accept the advocacy of condoms then individuals would be actively supporting positive sexual behaviors and practices. The PDA and Viravaidya support advocacy of the condom for all ages because it is viewed as a generational issue. Parents and teachers do not object to integrating condoms and HIV/AIDS instruction into all levels of education, since such programs are saving lives. See more under PDA strategy. The HIV/AIDS epidemic directly affects the Thai economy and thereby Thailand's development. The increasing infection rate of HIV and the subsequent mortality rate of Thai's youths will restrict the future labor force, creating an insufficiency of production capacity for Thailand's future. Simultaneously, such infected and/or affected individuals will place a strain on the Thai health care system. Therefore, the PDA and Viravaidya's HIV/AIDS campaign is both an immediate and long-term solution-based movement. =Poverty reduction= An increasing rate in population growth is directly related to degrees of poverty in developing states. The repercussion of a high population growth rate include affecting education, health care, employment, economic growth, and overall development. Relative to poverty, high growth rates delay economic growth thereby constraining the poor's consumption capacity. A decrease in the growth rate would have both an immediate effect at the micro level and eventually at a macro level for a state's economy. A decreasing population growth rate creates a work force that must provide for fewer dependents at both ends of the age spectrum. The common slogan for battling population growth rate is, ‚Äúdelay the first, postpone the second and prevent the third.‚Äù The Community-Based Incentive Thailand (CBIT) Criticism PDA received some criticism in its early stages, mainly from government institutions. As a non-profit organization, it was considered controversial for PDA to sell condoms instead of distributing them for free. PDA counter-argued that selling condoms was necessary in order for it to sustain itself as an organization and rely less on foreign aid.

All 113 on board escaped injury. Accident Arriving from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport with 94 passengers and 19 crew, at 15:20 local time flight 742 was approaching Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, when the crew received a 'not down and locked' indication for the nose gear and aborted the approach. Following unsuccessful troubleshooting the crew, led by captain Hushang Shahbazi, decided to divert to Mehrabad where a low approach confirmed the nose gear was not extended. The crew subsequently landed the aircraft without the nose gear on runway 29L at about 16:00 local time and came to a stand still on both main gear and the nose of the aircraft. The aircraft was evacuated. No injuries occurred. Aftermath Although initially subjected to a ban from flying while the incident was investigated, Captain Shahbazi was acclaimed as a national hero, and received more than 11,000 emails from people in Iran and overseas.

Paul Smith Power Station.\\" Fact sheet. The plant is subject to the federal Clean Air Act. Because of the age of the power plant units, and the need to maintain the plant's capabilities to ensure reliability of the regional power grid, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) had exempted the plant from compliance with a state law, the Healthy Air Act, which sets stringent air pollution limits for sulfur oxide and NOx. However, FirstEnergy decided to cease plant operations in 2012, and in 2013 MDE proposed reinstating the stringent state emission requirements, in case the plant resumes operations in the future.Maryland Department of the Environment, Baltimore, MD (2013-04-05). \\"Notice of Proposed Action: 26.11.27 Emission Limitations for Power Plants.\\" Maryland Register, Vol. 40, Issue 7. pp. 626-7. History Construction of the first power plant at Williamsport began in 1922 by the Potomac Public Service Company. In 1923 the company became part of the Potomac Edison Company, and in 1925 Potomac Edison joined West Penn Electric Company. The first generating unit began service in 1927. Coal was delivered to the plant by the Western Maryland Railway. The plant was named for R. Paul Smith, the company's first president.U.S. Historic American Engineering Record (2008). \\"Potomac Edison Company, Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Bridge, Spanning C & O Canal South of U.S. 11, Williamsport, Washington, MD.\\" HAER No. MD-23. (Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.) The 1927 unit was replaced by a new unit in 1947 with a nameplate capacity of 34.5 MW. An additional 75 MW operating unit was constructed in 1958. In 1960 the West Penn Electric Company was renamed Allegheny Power System, Inc. Circa 1970 the plant began to receive coal deliveries by truck, and rail deliveries ended. On January 26, 2012 parent company FirstEnergy announced that the station would be closed due to the cost of retrofitting the plant to comply with environmental regulations due to take effect in 2015. The R. Paul Smith station was one of six FirstEnergy stations to be retired in 2012. In its last years the plant was operated intermittently. FirstEnergy ceased plant operations on September 1, 2012.

Link to text in Russian Journal  Life and career  Leonid Kannegisser (also spelled Kanngie√üer or Kannegiesser) was born in March 1896 in Nikolaev, Ukraine, (then part of the Russian Empire), into a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Akim (Joachim) Kannegisser, was a mechanical engineer and the head of Russia's largest shipyards, the Black Sea Shipyard, and his mother was a doctor. Kannegisser graduated from a private school and in 1913 became a military cadet in the Mikhailov Artillery School of the Imperial Russian Army. Kannegisser studied economics from 1915 to 1917 at the Petrograd Polytechnic Institute and was a member of Popular Socialists, a moderate left-wing anti- Communist political party. An admirer of Alexander Kerensky, on the night of 25 to 26 October 1917 (Old Style Julian Calendar), during the October Revolution, Kannegisser and several other cadets defended the Provisional Government at the Winter Palace. In 1917 he dedicated a poem to Alexander Kerensky.  Uritsky's assassination  On 17 August 1918 around nine o‚Äôclock, Kannegisser, wearing a leather jacket and an officers cap, turned up at the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, left his bicycle by the door and entered the building. Uritsky arrived in his car at around ten o‚Äôclock, and a few moments later he was fatally shot in his head and body by Kannegisser. After shooting Uritsky, he ran out into the street and tried to escape on his bicycle, riding quickly but was chased by a car. He threw away his bicycle and ran into the British embassy. Kannegisser left the embassy after having donned a longcoat and opened fire on Red Guards but he was arrested. Kannegisser was interrogated. He declared that he had acted alone and was executed shortly afterwards in Petrograd. Following his arrest, the Bolshevik authorities also arrested several members of his family and friends. After being released, his parents emigrated to Warsaw, where they died. = Motivation = Kannegisser was part of a clandestine anti-Bolshevik group led by his cousin, Maximilian Filonenko, who had close links with Boris Savinkov, who gave the order to assassinate Uritsky. Viktor Pereltsveig, an army officer lover (Kannegisser was homosexual), was executed with a group of officers by the Cheka in the summer of 1918. Kannegisser decided to take revenge by killing Uritsky, who had signed the execution orders.  Poetry  From childhood Kannegisser had written poetry and was a friend of Sergei Yesenin. He hosted in his house many literary meetings, where Marina Tsvetaeva, Osip Mandelshtam and others presented their poetry.Shentalinsky, page 115. A decade after Kannegiesser's execution his poems were posthumously published by Mark Aldanov in Paris in 1928. A major part of Kannegisser's literary heritage is preserved in the closed files of the Central Government Archives of Literature and Art in Moscow.

Life Joseph William McKay was born on January 31, 1829 at Rupert's House in Waskaganish, Quebec, to William and Mary Bunn McKay, both M√©tis. His father was a clerk with the Hudson's Bay Company. His grandfather, John Richards McKay, and uncles were active in the fur trade. When he was nine or ten years old Joseph William was sent to the Red River Academy where he remained for five years, boarding with his maternal grandfather, Thomas Bunn; according to family tradition his parents had intended to send him to school in Scotland but he literally missed the boat. He married Helen Holmes at Victoria, British Columbia on June 16, 1860. Together they had four daughters and two sons. Career =Hudson's Bay Company= He began working for the Hudson's Bay Company in Fort Vancouver in 1844 at the age of 15 and was sent by Governor Simpson to serve as an apprentice seaman on a Pacific coast vessel. After serving his apprenticeship he moved to Fort Victoria where when not carrying on his clerical duties, he acted as surgical assistant to J. S. Helmcken.\\"Joseph William McKay\\", BC Metis Mapping Project The following September he accompanied the British naval officers Captain Henry W. Parke and Lieutenant William Peel on their reconnaissance of Oregon Territory. In 1846 he was transferred to Fort Victoria where he participated in a survey that winter of the area around Victoria and Esquimalt. In 1848 he was promoted to the rank of postmaster, and the following year he was Roderick Finlayson‚Äôs second in command at Fort Victoria. Eventually he rose to become second-in-command under Governor James Douglas. Nanaimo Bastion and founder of Nanaimo McKay was instrumental in the discovery of coal at Nanaimo. He moved there in 1849 and took possession of the coal fields for the HBC in 1852. While in charge there McKay opened a coal mine, a sawmill, a saltern, and a school in the settlement. He is credited with the construction of the Nanaimo Bastion. As an apprentice clerk he played a significant role in the negotiation of the Douglas Treaties in the Colony of Vancouver Island. During the Crimean War McKay was sent to Fort Simpson (Port Simpson, B.C.) to ensure that the HBC and the Russian American Company remained neutral. In the early 1850s Douglas sent McKay to scout the Cowichan and Comox valleys. Shortly after the beginning of the Fraser River gold-rush in the summer of 1858 McKay was sent by Douglas to search for a route to the gold-fields between Howe Sound and Lillooet Lake. In June 1860 he was made chief trader and placed in charge of the Thompson's River district. In 1865, in conjunction with John Rae, McKay conducted a survey of the country between Williams Creek and T√™te Jaune Cache in anticipation of the HBC's proposed telegraph line from Fort Garry (Winnipeg) to New Westminster (B.C.).Barkwell, Lawrence. \\"Joseph William McKay (1829-1900)\\", Louis Riel Institute Between 1866 and 1878 he was in charge of the company's operations at Fort Yale (Yale), in the Kootenay district, and in the Cassiar and the Stikine mining districts, and he directed its coastal trade at Fort Simpson. The HBC promoted him to factor in 1872. McKay's varied interests involved exploration, economic development, and colonization of Vancouver Island. He was released by the company in 1878 because of the extent of his outside business interests, which included investments in silver mines and timber leases. After leaving the company he was a salmon cannery manager for the North Western Commercial Company of San Francisco. =Offices held= In 1856 McKay was elected to the first House of Assembly of Vancouver Island representing the Victoria district. He was a justice of the peace from 1876 to 1885. Indian affairs McKay worked for the dominion government, being appointed census commissioner for British Columbia in 1881 and Indian agent two years later, first for the northwest coast and then for the Kamloops and Okanagan agencies. While agent he urged Indians to take up stock-raising and to grow western crops, attempted to prevent the trespass of Canadian Pacific Railway crews and European settlers on Indian land, and established an Indian industrial school near Kamloops. He personally inoculated more than 1,300 Indians with smallpox vaccine between 1886 and 1888. In 1893 he was appointed assistant to Arthur Wellesley Vowell, the superintendent of Indian affairs for British Columbia. He was assistant superintendent of Indian Affairs in BC at the time of his death. During his last years in Victoria he also lectured and wrote several articles on the fur trade and on the Indians of British Columbia. McKay was described as an \\"...undersized man in cowhide coat and breeches, jack-boots & large-peaked cap; like an overgrown jockey.\\" He died in Victoria, B.C., on 21 December 1900. Records relating to McKay's career as a chief trader for the Hudson's Bay Company including correspondence, a journal, notes regarding festivals and traditional beliefs of the B.C.

A representation of the T box DNA binding domain The Eomesodermin/Tbr2 gene, EOMES, encodes a member of a conserved protein family that shares a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors, which control gene expression, involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 itself controls regulation of radial glia, as well as other related cells. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 has also been found to have a role in immune response, and there exists some loose evidence for its connections in other systems.  Development  Eomesodermin/Tbr2 is expressed highly in the intermediate progenitor stage of the developing neuron. Neurons, the primary functional cells of the brain, are developed from radial glia cells. This process of cells developing into other types of cells is called differentiation. Radial glia are present in the ventricular zone of the brain, which are on the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles. Radial glia divide and migrate towards the surface of the brain, the cerebral cortex. During this migration, there are three stages of cellular development: radial glia, intermediate progenitors, and postmitotic projection neurons. Radial glia express Pax6, while intermediate progenitor cells express Eomesodermin/Tbr2, and postmitotic projection neurons express Tbr1. This process, known as neurogenesis, occurs mainly in the developing cortex before the organism has fully developed, and thus Eomesodermin/Tbr2 has been implicated in neurodevelopment. However, neurogenesis has been found to occur to some extent in the ventricular zone in fully developed organisms. left Cerebral Cortex It has been found experimentally through knock out studies, that mice lacking Eomesodermin/Tbr2 during early development have a reduced number of actively dividing cells, called proliferating cells, in the subventricular zone, a key area of neurogenesis in the brain. This, may lead to the microcephaly (small head size due to improper brain development) seen in Eomesodermin/Tbr2 deficient mice. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 lacking mice have smaller upper cortical layers and a smaller sub ventricular zone in the brain, and have an absence of a mitral cell (neurons involved in the olfactory pathway) layer, with mitral cells instead being scattered about. On the behavioral side, Eomesodermin/Tbr2 lacking mice show high anger levels and perform infanticide. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 lacking mice also seem to have problems with long axon connections. Axons are projections from neurons that connect with other cells in what is called a synapse and send neurotransmitters. In this way, they can communicate with other cells, and form the processing that allows are brains to function. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 lacking mice seem to lack fully formed commissural fibers, which connect the two hemispheres of the brain, and lack the corpus callosum, another region of the brain involved in hemisphere connections. left Eomesodermin/Tbr2 has also been implicated in other key development systems. It was found that early in development, Eomesodermin/Tbr2 controls early differentiation of the cardiac mesoderm. In fact, lack of Eomesodermin/Tbr2 seems to cause cells to fail to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, which are heart muscle cells. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 controls the expression of cardiac specific genes Mesp1, Myl7, Myl2, Myocardin, Nkx2.5 and Mef2c. The human heart, with cardiac muscles Additionally, although neurogenesis occurs primarily in the early stages of development, there are locations within the brain that have been discovered to perform neurogenesis into adulthood. One of these areas, the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, shows decreased neurogenesis when Eomesodermin/Tbr2 is removed. It was also found that Eomesodermin/Tbr2 functions by reducing amounts of Sox2, which is associated with radial glia. Another study found that mice without Eomesodermin/Tbr2 lacked long term memory formation, which may relate to Eomesodermin/Tbr2's effects on the hippocampus.  Immune response  Scanning electron micrograph of a human T cell Eomesodermin/Tbr2 is highly expressed in CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are the helper T cells which detect foreign particles in the body, and call CD8+ T cells to facilitate death of the foreign particles. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 was found to play a role in the anti cancer properties of CD8+ T cells. Lack of Eomesodermin/Tbr2, alongside T bet another T box protein caused CD8+ T cells to not penetrate tumors so they could perform their anti cancer duties. Eomesodermin/Tbr2 prevents CD8+ cells from differentiating into other types of T cells, but does not play a role in the production of CD8+ T cells itself. Despite Eomesodermin/Tbr2 playing a role in the ability of CD8+ T cells to penetrate tumors, it only plays a small role in production of Interferon- gamma, which is a molecule that communicates to other immune cells during an immune response.

The Juice, December 10, 2011. Subsequently, racial discord in the football program began to be highlighted, which resulted in an increase in racial tension. This tension began in 1969 when a group known as the \\"Syracuse 8\\" highlighted the discrimination they faced in football by coach Floyd \\"Ben\\" Schwartzwalder. By the opening pre-game of the season, tensions were so high that they resulted in a confrontation between nearly 100 policemen and at least 400 students at the football stadium at Syracuse University.\\"The 'Syracuse 8,' A Commitment For Change\\", African American Registry, April 9, 1970. Due to increasing racial tension and in response to the civil rights movement, in 1968, Black students at Syracuse University staged a protest outside of S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, demanding that the university offer Black Studies classes that highlighted and included the intellectual, historical and cultural contributions of African Americans.Powell, Karla, \\"A Look Back through Our struggles\\", Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter, Special -Edition, 2004/2005. The administration at Syracuse University subsequently began to make concessions by offering Black Studies classes as an elective.John Robert Greene, Syracuse University: Eggers Years, 1998, p. 98. African American Studies (AAS) began as a program in 1972 and then became a department as part of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1979.Davis, Deborah R. Black Students' Perceptions: the complexity of persistence to graduation at an American University, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, 2004, 2007. The 1960s student protests also resulted in an Afro-American Cultural center and marked the beginning of the MLK library collection. The first conference on Critical Issues in Afro-American and African Studies was held at Syracuse University in 1976.The Yale Journal of Law and Liberation, Vol. 1, p. 92, 1992. During the 1980s, Syracuse students again advocated the administration to widen the pool of African American faculty applicants, hire a department chairperson and in order to increase the staff in the AAS department.Davis, \\"Black Students' Perceptions\\" (2004, 2007), p. 15. The department has stayed without a chair and other key positions for more than a year. Members of the Syracuse African-American Students Association (SAS) were at the forefront of this movement.Davis, Black Students' Perceptions (2004, 2007), p. 16. In 1989, 120 SAS member students confronted Chancellor Melvin Eggers at a round table meeting in order to air their grievances. The group's efforts led to a 400-student protest in 1990 led by SAS President Quentin Stith. The students also advocated for a program that allowed all students (not just those of African-American descent) to learn about the contribution of African Americans in American history. The students were concerned with preserving Black identity and saw their dedication towards African studies as a collective struggle. Throughout the 1980s, students continued to play an active role on the university campus. It has now grown into a national and international renowned program that explores linkages between Africa and the African Diaspora. It continues to pioneer revolutionary thinking in its projects, programs, and academics.

It began in 2005 as a uniquely innovative program that has an emphasis in the area studies of Africa, the Caribbean and the United States. Whereas most programs concentrate on history and biographies, it focuses on the linkages between Africa and the African Diaspora from a multi-disciplinary approach involving cultural, social scientific, political, economic and environmental perspectives. It also provides for intellectual inquiry into philosophy of Pan Africanism and Pan Africanism as a historical, cultural, and contemporary movement. It is the only masters program in Pan African studies that focuses on field research and theory.Baker, David, \\"Crossing Borders\\", Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter, Special Edition, 2004/2005. The Program has an experiential component through affiliations that the department has with institutions abroad that leads to all students studying in Africa, the Caribbean, Canada, or African American sites. Africa Initiative The AAS department views Africa as an integral part of its scholarly vision and mission. The Africa Initiative (AI) is located in the department of African American studies and was launched in 2001 with a goal of focusing on Africa. AI aims at spearheading revitalized interest in Africa, which has declined in many United States institutions of higher learning since the end of the \\"Cold War. Its aim is to also address Africa's silencing, marginalization and stereotyping.Makuja, Darius Rev., \\"The Africa Initiative Statement\\", Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter, Special Edition, 2004/2005. It also aims to revitalize interest in Africa as an area of study after the decline of the East African Studies Program at Syracuse University which initiated projects including the Eduardo Mondlane Lecture Series. The East African program had also been instrumental in spearheading an east African library collection at Syracuse's Bird Library that includes the Kenyan and Tanzanian national archives (one of the few collections of these archives in the United States). =Eduardo Mondlane Brown Bag Lecture Series= AI administers the \\"Eduardo Mondlane Memorial Lecture Series\\". The lecture series was named after the founder of Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), Eduardo Mondlane, who was also a former professor at Syracuse University. In recent years, it has become more important in keeping a focus on topical issue on Africa in academia. The lecture series was originally administered by the East African Studies Program at Syracuse University that is now dissolved For several years, this interactive series has brought scholars, students, and the community together to discuss pertinent issues concerning Africa to the university. It is during one of these lecture series on February 20, 1970, that Guinea-Bissau nationalist Am√≠lcar Cabral delivered his famous speech \\"National Liberation and Culture\\" at Syracuse University.

Taylor House Museum of Historic Frenchtown The Taylor House, a historical landmark in the Tallahassee Community, was built in 1894 by Lewis Washington Taylor and Lucretia McPherson Taylor, and is a historical museum and research facility for Leon County, Florida. Lewis Washington Taylor L.W. Taylor (1865-1931), was a well-known educator, businessman and community leader. He taught at Centerville School, Old Lincoln High School (Tallahassee, Florida) and Bel Air, a one-room, rural schoolhouse on ground which had once been an ante-bellum plantation. Taylor broke barriers for African-Americans in Leon County, as he taught and tutored White children from well-to-do families for 10 cents. Self-employed as a proprietor of a jewelry store, Taylor made his jewelry out of gold wire which he kept in an upstairs bedroom of the Taylor home. Lucretia McPherson Taylor Lucretia Taylor descended from the Edwards, a pioneer Leon County family. She was a master cook and seamstress. Taylor was born a slave on May 19, 1865 in Tallahassee, a day before the Emancipation Proclamation was read downtown at the Knott House by General Edward M. McCook. She cooked for the family of Lewis M. Lively for whom the Lively Technical Center, located on the campus of Tallahassee Community College is named. Married on Dec. 17, 1887, the Taylors were parents to 13 children, who all spent time in front of a classroom. History The home remained in the Taylor family until it was abandoned in 1978. In 1995, the Taylor House had come within a week of being demolished by the city until Aquilina Howell, granddaughter of the Taylors and a legendary community leader who went on the become the first woman assistant school superintendent in Leon County, turned to the Tallahassee Urban League, Inc. The Urban League purchased and restored the two-story structure to its original appearance; completing rehabilitation in 2001.

At one time the Wachter Ranch contained 28,800 acres in Morton and Oliver Counties and was the largest deeded ranch in North Dakota. The Wachter family ran Dakota Sand and Gravel and operated a Mayflower moving company franchise. As automobiles became the norm, the family purchased and ran Missouri Valley Motors for a time.Polk's Bismarck (Burleigh County, ND) City Directories, 1955, pg. 239. Other businesses operated by the heirs of Charles Wachter included Kirkwood Motor Inn, Kirkwood Plaza shopping center, the Bank of Kirkwood Plaza, House of Bottles, Towne and Country Liquor, and Towne and Country Real Estate. The most influential member of the third generation of the Wachter family was Paul H. Wachter (d. 1973), son of Paul August. This younger Wachter was well known for his business enterprises and land developments in the Bismarck area.

Pneumatic, hydraulic-action, and mercury displacement timers. Being used in a variety of things such as printing presses, motors, and even irrigation systems, the dashpot timer has seen many applications. Even in modern times with electrical and digital timers, these old mechanical timers are still in use due to their simplicity and ability to function in tough environments.  Types  The dashpot timer is a fluid time- on-timer that can be used in definite time motor acceleration starters and controllers. A dashpot timer is a container, a piston, and a shaft. The dashpot timer functions when a magnetic field forces a piston to move within a cylinder when the coil is energized. The movement of the piston is limited by fluid passing through an orifice on the piston. The amount of fluid passing through the orifice is controlled by a throttle value, which determines the delay. If the fluid used to move the piston is air it is actually known as a pneumatic dashpot. If the fluid is oil, it is known as a hydraulic dashpot. Another kind of dashpot timer is the mercury displacement timer, this model uses mercury to contact electrodes. = Pneumatic timer = The pneumatic timer consists of a timing disk, filter, diaphragm, solenoid coil, operating spring and a solenoid core. When the pneumatic timer is energized, the solenoid core moves up into the coil. When this occurs, the core applies pressure on the diaphragm. This moves the diaphragm into the top chamber, air trapped in the chamber is expelled through the needle valve timing disk. In pneumatic timers the amount of delay that occurs can be altered by adjusting the needle valve. Pneumatic timers are very reliable and have a very long operational life expectancy = Hydraulic-action timers = Hydraulic dashpots or hydraulic-action timers are similar in appearance and operation to pneumatic timers. Hydraulic-action timers work by energizing the solenoid coil which pulls the hollow core into the center of the coil. Fluid in the hollow core is then forced to go through an orifice at the top, a one way check valve at the bottom of the hollow core prevents the fluid from escaping through the bottom. After the fluid is expelled, the core completes its upward movement and closes an air gap in the core, which in turn increases its electromagnetic field strength. When the coil becomes de-energized, it releases the core, and fluid is forced back into the hollow area of the core through the check valve, so the fluid is used again next time the coil is energized. Hydraulic action timers are usually designed for a specific time, which is set in the factory during their manufacture. These timers are also very reliable. = Mercury- displacement timers = Another important classification of dashpot timers are mercury-displacement timers. These depend on the displacement of a pool of mercury that make connection with two electrodes. There are two kinds of mercury displacement timers, delayed-make displacement timers and slow break displacement timers. Delayed-make displacement timers work by having a plunger floating in a container of mercury, when energy is applied to the coil it pulls the plunger into its center. The mercury that is displaced by this enters the thimble though an orifice. Inert gas trapped at the top of the thimble prevents the mercury from rising. Eventually the gas escapes through a ceramic plug, and this permits mercury to fill the thimble. When the mercury rises to a certain level it makes contact between electrodes. The amount of delay that this produces is determined when it is manufactured. Slow-break displacement timers work in the same way as delayed-make displacement timers only that when the coil is de-energized, the plunger rises to its original position, and mercury flows through the orifice to reach outside level. when it falls below the lip of the ceramic cup, electrical contacts become open. Its physical size is used to regulate the delay time of connection break. These timers are designed with a fixed delay period, usually to a maximum of 20 minutes.  Application  Most dashpot timers are used in sequential, automatic control applications where the completion of one operation causes the start of another process. Common applications include automatic milling machines, periodic lubrication, animated shop-window displays, staged start-up of pumps, automatic presses, and industrial washing machines. Dashpot timers are also used in motors, blowers, lighting, and control valves as well as in banking, retail, irrigation, and general industrial applications. Common problems with dashpot timers were variations in temperature, the entrance of dirt and other matter into the dashpot system, and general wear and tear of the system. Every kind of dashpot timer has seen use in different technologies, from toasters to automated factory operations. The dashpot timer, or mechanical timer, has changed the way we use technology. With its many industrial and commercial applications, to household appliances and gardening, the dashpot timer is a very important invention that has certainly led to many changes in how thing were done during the 20th century and how things are done in modern times. In modern times, even though we have electrical and digital timers, mechanical timers are still used, especially in cases where the environment is not friendly for electronics. Another advantage of mechanical timers is that they are easy to repair. The amount of precise automated systems used in modern factories shows the usefulness and precision of these timers, while their presence in many households shows their availability and inexpensiveness. Even with the small problems that are present in these systems they have proven themselves reliable enough to be used in many fields for nearly a century.  References  * Herman, Stephen.

It is located near the village of ƒåerven√Ω Kl√°≈°tor within the Pieniny Mountains, next to the Dunajec River. Carthusian Period The monastery was founded in the early 14th century, during the Hungarian Kingdom. Court documents from 1307 state that a man by the name of master Kokos from Brezovica (Berzevice), founded six monasteries as a punishment for murder. In 1319 he donated 62 sectors of his village, Lechnice to the Carthusian order. A wooden structure was built in 1330, which was later replaced by bricks and stones. The monastery gets the name \\"Red\\" from some brick, such as the cornices below the roofs and ribs of the vaults (unpaved in the chapter hall), and the red tiles that were used on the roofs. The monastery suffered several quarrels with Czorsztyn lords, and was occupied by Hussites in 1431 and in 1433. It was adversely hit by the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1515, and in 1545 Czorsztyn Knights from Niedzica Castle attacked the monastery, and the monks fled across the Dunajec River into Poland. The monastery was abolished during the Reformation in 1563, becoming a private residence for wealthy noblemen. Post Carthusian period In 1699, Ladislav Ma≈•a≈°ovsk√Ω, a bishop in Nitra (Nyitra), purchased the monastery, and donated to the Camaldolese order, who settled down it this area in 1711. In 1782 it was secularized as part of Emperor Joseph II's campaign against monastic orders that in his view didn't pursue useful activities. The monastery‚Äôs library was sold to Budapest, and the church equipment to Muszyna, Poland. In 1820 the Emperor Franz Joseph I donated the monastery to the newly founded Greek-Catholic diocese of Pre≈°ov.

Henoch set world records in the discus (twice), the shot put, and the 4 √ó 100 meters relay events. She also won German national championships in the shot put four times, the 4 √ó 100 meters relay three times, the discus twice, and the long jump. She was Jewish, and during the Holocaust she and her mother were deported and machine-gunned to death by the Nazis. Early life Henoch was Jewish, and was born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia (Germany). Her father, a businessman, died in 1912. She and her family moved to Berlin, and her mother subsequently remarried. Track and field career Henoch set world records in the discus, shot put, and‚Äîwith her teammates‚Äî4 √ó 100 meters relay events. Between 1922 and 1926, she won 10 German national championships: in shot put, 1922‚Äì25; discus, 1923 and 1924; long jump, 1924; and 4 √ó 100 meters relay, 1924‚Äì26. After World War I, Henoch joined the Berlin Sports Club (BSC), which was approximately one quarter Jewish. She missed a chance to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics, because Germany was not allowed to participate in the Games after World War I. In 1924, she trained the women's section in Bar Kochba Berlin. She was a member of the BSC hockey team, which won the Berlin Hockey Championship in 1925. =Discus= She set a world record in discus on 1 October 1922, with a distance of 24.90 meters. She bettered this on 8 July 1923, with a throw of 26.62 meters. She won the German national championship in discus in 1923 and 1924, and won the silver medal in 1925. =Long jump= In 1924, Henoch won the German Long Jump Championship, having won the bronze medal in the event the prior year. =Shot put= On 16 August 1925 Henoch set a world shot put record with a throw of 11.57 meters.

She then joined the J√ºdischer Turn-und Sportclub 1905 (Jewish Gymnastics and Sports Club 1905), which was limited to Jews, for which she played team handball and was a trainer. She also became a gymnastics teacher at a Jewish elementary school. Because she was Jewish, the German government did not allow her to participate in the 1936 Summer Olympics. Killing The Nazi German government deported Henoch, her 66-year-old mother, and her brother to the Riga Ghetto in Nazi Germany-occupied Latvia on 5 September 1942, during World War II. She and her mother were taken from the ghetto and machine-gunned to death by an Einsatzgruppen mobile killing unit in September 1942, along with a large number of other Jews taken from the ghetto. They were all buried in a mass grave near Riga, Latvia. Her brother disappeared, without a trace.

He was the Minister for Health until July 2020. Previously he has been Opposition Spokesperson for Small Business and Economic Development. Early life Clark grew up in Beachlands, just south of Auckland, and was schooled in Auckland. He studied at Saint Kentigern College and spent his last year on a school exchange in Germany, immersing himself in the German language. In 1991, Clark moved to Dunedin to study at the University of Otago. He initially studied medicine but abandoned that in favour of pursuing degrees in theology and philosophy. Clark also studied theology and philosophy at Eberhard Karls University in T√ºbingen. Ordained in 1997, Clark is a Presbyterian minister. He worked as the Assistant Minister at St Lukes Presbyterian Church in Auckland. He was the celebrant at the civil union of MP Grant Robertson. Clark later returned to the University of Otago and completed a PhD on the work of German/New Zealand refugee and existentialist thinker Helmut Herbert Hermann Rex. He has also worked as a Treasury analyst and the warden of Selwyn College at the University of Otago. Before his election to Parliament, Clark served as deputy chair of the Otago Community Trust. Member of Parliament =Opposition, 2011‚Äì2017= After serving as chairman on the Labour Party Dunedin North electorate committee, Clark was selected by the Labour Party to replace the retiring Pete Hodgson in the electorate. He won the seat at the 2011 election securing 12,976 votes (44.25 percent), 3489 more than his closest rival. Clark's maiden parliamentary speech focused on his concern about rising inequality and his passion for social justice. In it, he argued that a more equal society will produce better outcomes, both socially and economically. Clark shot to early prominence in 2013 as the sponsor of the popular ‚ÄòMondayising‚Äô Bill that saw additional public holidays set aside in years when Waitangi Day and Anzac Day fall on a weekend. This was the first Bill to pass against the Government in four years. In Opposition he served as Labour's spokesperson for various areas, including Revenue, Economic Development, Small Business, Tertiary Education, and latterly Health. During his time as Revenue spokesperson, he drew attention to difficulties the dated Inland Revenue computer system was creating for the organisation, and the small amounts that multinational companies were contributing to the tax base. Clark completed an Eisenhower Fellowship in 2013, focusing much of his trip on the priority accorded to the values of fairness and freedom in New Zealand and the United States. Clark stood again in Dunedin North for the 2014 general election, securing 16,315 votes (46.44 percent). This was 5917 more than his closest rival, National list MP Michael Woodhouse, and thus he increased his majority. =Coalition Government, 2017‚Äìpresent= David Clark was re-elected in Dunedin North during the 2017 general election, securing 21,259 votes and defeating Woodhouse by 11,754 votes. He was elected as a Cabinet Minister by the Labour Party caucus following Labour's formation of a government with New Zealand First and the Greens. In late April 2018, Clark appointed three new chairs to head Auckland's three district health boards: Pat Snedden for the Auckland District Health Board, Judy McGregor for the Waitemata District Health Board, and Vui Mark Gosche for the Counties Manukau District Health Board. These appointments replace Lester Levy, who had headed all three boards and resigned in December 2017. On 30 April 2018, Clark conceded that the Government would be unable to deliver on its election promise of reducing General practitioner fees but indicated that it would be introduced in phases over time. On 4 May 2018, Clark announced that the Dunedin Public Hospital would be replaced by a new hospital on the site of the former Cadbury factory site and a neighbouring block that included the building occupied by Work and Income. The construction project is estimated to cost NZ$1.4 billion, would involve around a thousand workers, and is expected to be completed by 2026. In mid-June 2018, Clark received criticism from employees of the Counties Manukau District Health Board for allegedly trying to silence their reports of run-down buildings, asbestos, and overflowing sewage at Middlemore Hospital. Clark has denied these allegations and expressed criticism for staff communicating through the media rather than through official channels. Clark subsequently apologized to Counties Manukau DHB chairman Rabin Rabindran for the handling of the Middlemore saga. That same month, Clark defended the Government's $500 million pay offer to nurses after the national union, the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, voted to go on strike. In mid-July 2018, Clark was forced to publicly defend his decision to go on a family holiday prior to a planned national strike by the Nurses Organisation. On 25 July, Clark in his capacity as Health Minister signed a NZ$173.5 million pay equity agreement to pay 5,000 mental health and addiction workers more. Other co-signatories and interested parties included union representatives from the E t≈´ and the Public Service Association as well as the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. In late July, he announced that the District Health Boards, Nurses Organisation, and the Ministry of Health had successfully negotiated a joint accord to ensure safe staffing levels for nurses. In early September 2018, Clark suspended the troubled Oracle IT project to overhaul the District Health Boards' ageing IT systems. The troubled project had cost NZ$100 million. In mid-November, Clark announced that the Government had scrapped plans for a proposed third medical school in the Waikato region on the grounds that the project would have cost billions to set up and operate. On 19 November, he also announced that the Government would establish a NZ$20 million new health centre in the South Island town of Westport. COVID-19 pandemic As Minister of Health, Clark took a leadership role in the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. In early April 2020, Clark drew media attention and public criticism when he drove to a Dunedin park two kilometres away from his home to ride a mountain bike trail despite the Government's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Clark later apologised to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for ignoring official guidelines advising against non-essential travel. During the first week of the country's national lock-down he also drove his family twenty kilometres to a nearby beach for a walk. Ardern subsequently announced that Clark offered his resignation, but due to his role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, she did not accept it, instead depriving him of his ministerial role as Associate Finance Minister and demoting him to the bottom of Labour's Cabinet ranking. In late June 2020, Clark attracted media attention and criticism following a press conference at which he stated, \\"The director-general has accepted that protocols weren't being followed, he has accepted responsibility for that and has set about putting it right\\". His remark was interpreted by some journalists as blaming Bloomfield for the Ministry of Health's mismanagement of quarantine following a recent outbreak stemming from overseas travel. The Spinoff editor Toby Manhire opined that Clark's \\"humility bypass\\" created problems for Ardern's government. Left-wing commentator Chris Trotter described Clark's handling of the situation as \\"shameful\\" and called on Ardern to dismiss him from his position. Right-wing commentator Trish Anderson criticised Clark for not \\"'pulling his weight' in the government\\" and criticised Ardern's perceived inaction against him as a \\"failure of leadership.\\" Clark's Wikipedia article was also vandalised with remarks attacking his handling of the press conference with Bloomfield. In early July 2020, Clark announced that he was resigning as Minister of Health, stating that \\"I've always taken a view that the team must come first ... so I've made the call that it's best for me to step aside.\\" Prime Minister Ardern accepted his resignation, stating that she \\"accepted Clark's conclusion that his presence in the role was creating an unhelpful distraction from the Government's ongoing response to Covid-19 and wider health reforms.\\" Personal life Clark is married to Katrina, and they have three children. His brother, Ben, stood for Labour in the North Shore at the 2011 election, placing second behind Maggie Barry. During his university years, Clark was a competitive cyclist and has twice completed the Ironman Triathlon.

He contested the Te Tai Tonga electorate against the incumbent, Rahui Katene of the MƒÅori Party. Labour's selection of Tirikatene was criticised as cynical by Katene, as they are both from the same hap≈´, but this was rejected by Tirikatene, as \\"all Maoris connect up somewhere along the line\\". Tirikatene won the electorate with a margin of 1,475 votes. The electorate had previously been held by Labour, from until 2005.

Before moving to New Zealand, he was a member of the Chinese Communist Party and worked for the People's Liberation Army, including training linguists to intercept foreign communications. He is a member of the National Party and has been a National MP from 2011, but has announced that he will retire from politics at the 2020 general election. Early life Yang grew up in Jiangxi Province in southern China. He earned his MA and PhD in international relations from the Australian National University. In 1999 Yang joined the University of Auckland as a Senior Lecturer in Political Studies. He was granted New Zealand citizenship on 14 June 2004. Member of Parliament Yang was ranked at 36 on the National Party list for the 2011 New Zealand general election. He was the highest ranked new candidate on the list and was seen as a replacement for Pansy Wong, a Chinese MP who had resigned since the previous election. Yang was re-elected on the party list in 2014 and 2017. During his parliamentary career, Yang was the deputy chair of the Health select committee from 2013‚Äì14, the chair of the Education and Science committee from 2014‚Äì2017 and the chair of Governance and Administration committee from 2017‚Äì2020. He was additionally appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Ethnic Communities in 2017 and the National Party opposition spokesperson for statistics from 2017‚Äì2020. In 2019, it was reported that Yang organised a meeting between National Party leader Simon Bridges and Guo Shengkun, the head of the Chinese Communist Party secret police during a visit to China. While he was initially re-selected as a National Party list candidate in March 2020 for that year's general election, Yang later announced his retirement from politics following renewed pressure from New Zealand First MP Winston Peters over his alleged links to Chinese military intelligence. Spy allegations On 13 September 2017 accusations were raised in the media that Yang taught English to Chinese spies in the 1980s and 1990s. Yang admitted he had a background as a civilian, or non- ranking, officer in the Chinese military. In response to the accusations, the National Party released a copy of Yang's CV from 2012, which mentioned his time at the Air Force Engineering College and Luoyang People's Liberation Army University of Foreign Languages. The Financial Times says the Foreign Languages Institute is part of China's military intelligence apparatus run by the People's Liberation Army, training linguists to intercept foreign communications. It was also reported that Yang attracted the attention of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service three years prior to these revelations. Yang was a lecturer at the Foreign Language Institute and his immigration file shows he taught the English language and American studies. Yang claimed he taught his students to simply monitor communications, rather than carry out \\"the physical act of spying\\". He conceded he could be seen as having taught spies. The New Zealand Herald later reported that Yang did not disclose his links to the schools in his citizenship applications and instead substituted \\"partner\\" universities. Yang also confirmed that he had been a member of the Chinese Communist Party but claimed to be inactive since moving to New Zealand in 1994. In late June 2020, Yang came under further criticism from media and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters for refusing to give English-language interviews since the spy allegations surfaced and only granting interviews to local ethnic Chinese media.

He co-pioneered several community initiatives such as the Tamaki Achievement Pathway, Healthy Village Action Zone (HVAZ) Project, and the Inspiring Communities Exchange Network sponsored by the Tindall Foundation. Ngaro's governance experience includes key roles on the National Family Violence Taskforce, Auckland District Health Board and Pacific Advisory Committee Auckland City Council. He is also an Ambassador for the White Ribbon campaign. He later won a Sir Peter Blake Emerging Leader Award for his work on the Tamaki Transformation Project. Ngaro served as the Auckland District Health Board's Pacific committee chairman and as the Tamaki College board of trustees chairman. He is a member of various advisory committees for the Ministry of Social Development. Member of Parliament Ngaro was encouraged by his friend Sam Lotu-Iiga to become active in politics. Ngaro was a candidate for Citizens & Ratepayers in the Maungakiekie-Tamaki ward at the 2010 elections for the Auckland Council. He finished second to Richard Northey and was not elected. =Fifth National Government, 2011‚Äì2017= In early September 2011, he was announced as a list-only candidate for the New Zealand National Party at the 2011 election. He was ranked at 37 on the party list and was subsequently elected. He is the first Cook Islander to be elected to the New Zealand Parliament, sitting in the 50th Parliament. Ngaro voted against the End of Life Choice Bill (Assisted Suicide) and the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill. In the 2014 general election Ngaro was the National Party candidate for Te Atat≈´. He lost to Labour's Phil Twyford by 2,813 votes. Ranked 34th on the National Party list, Ngaro returned to parliament as a National List MP. He was instrumental in getting Cook Islands World War One soldiers formally recognised by the New Zealand government for their role during the Great War. On 20 December 2016, he was sworn in as a Minister in the Fifth National Government of New Zealand, after being promoted to Cabinet by Prime Minister Bill English. He served as the Minister for Pacific Peoples, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Associate Minister for Children, and Associate Minister for Social Housing. In May 2017, he told a National Party conference that he could cut government funding to organisations associated with Labour candidate Willie Jackson if Jackson spoke out against the government during the election campaign. He apologised after his words were criticised by both Labour leader Andrew Little and Minister of Finance Steven Joyce. Prime Minister Bill English subsequently offered reassurances to community agencies that they would always be free to express views on government policy, and announced that he had asked officials to review the decisions Ngaro had made as a minister. Ngaro did not offer his resignation. =Coalition Government, 2017‚Äìpresent= Following the 2017 general election, Ngaro became National's Spokesperson for Children, Community and Voluntary Sector, and Pacific Peoples. In mid-May 2019, there were reports that Ngaro was considering forming his own Christian party, providing a potential coalition partner for National at the 2020 general election. National Party leader Simon Bridges initially downplayed these reports but later stated that he was giving Ngaro the \\"space\\" to explore setting up a Christian values party. In late May 2019, Ngaro ruled out starting a new Christian party and confirmed that he would remain a member of the National Party. During the 2020 general election, Ngaro attracted media attention on 10 October after he posted a Facebook attack ad claiming that a vote for his Labour opponent Phil Twyford would lead to the decriminalisation of recreational cannabis and all drugs and unlimited abortion. Though Ngaro subsequently deleted his post, Twyford captured a screenshot and accused his opponent of spreading fake news. Ngaro's post was also criticised by Labour MP Ruth Dyson, Auckland Councilor Richard Hills, political commentator Ben Thomas, and former Internet Party Laila Harr√©. In addition, National Party leader Judith Collins issued a media statement that Ngaro's comments were not shared by the rest of the party. Views Ngaro is a Christian and a self- described Christian Zionist. Ngaro holds a theology degree and served as a community pastor. In mid-May 2019, Ngaro attracted criticism from former National MP Jami-Lee Ross and the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand when he shared a Facebook post on his page likening abortion to the Holocaust. Ngaro later apologised and issued a statement saying \\"he did not read the full Facebook post before sharing and said the word \\"tragedy\\" should have been used instead of \\"holocaust\\". In response, National Party leader Simon Bridges defended Ngaro's right to voice his opinion while stating that it was not something he would say. Personal life Ngaro is of Cook Island descent. Ngaro's grandmother's father was of Polish Jewish descent. His wife Mokauina is of Samoan-Niuean descent. They have four children: three boys and one girl. Controversy In 2009, Alfred Ngaro allegedly punched former Tamaki College art teacher Christopher Scott Roy for not bowing his head during a prayer, but the allegations were later dismissed in Court by Chief Judge Graeme Colgan who wrote in a report: \\"I am sceptical about the veracity of Mr Roy's accounts of relevant and crucial events in this case. He is not a consistently reliable witness of truth\\". Tamaki College denied any assault occurred. In a judgment released mid November 2013, ERA member Tania Tetitaha found there were several issues with Roy's statements about the alleged accusations. When Roy took the matter to police, they declined to investigate. The ERA also found a lack of evidence of bullying behaviour. The police and Employment Relations Authority did not investigate the incident.

He is a member of the National Party. Early life Goldsmith was born in 1971 in the Auckland suburb of Mount Eden. He descends from Charles George Goldsmith, a migrant from Liverpool who settled in the East Cape area early in New Zealand's colonial history. Charles Goldsmith had four wives‚Äîtwo MƒÅori (NgƒÅti Porou), and two pƒÅkehƒÅ‚Äîfathering 16 children. However Goldsmith has clarified that he is not himself of MƒÅori descent. Goldsmith attended Auckland Grammar School and the University of Auckland. Goldsmith then worked as a press secretary and speech writer for Phil Goff (Labour), Simon Upton (National) and John Banks (then a National MP). In 2000 Goldsmith became a public relations adviser and worked for Tranz Rail and the University of Auckland. Goldsmith graduated with an MA in history. He has written the biographies of John Banks, Don Brash, William Gallagher, Alan Gibbs and Te Hemara Tauhia as well as a history of taxes, Puketutu Island and a history of the Fletcher Building construction company. =Don Brash biography= At the launch of the Don Brash biography, Brash: A Biography, Goldsmith assured Danya Levy of the New Zealand Press Association that the book \\"was not commissioned by the National Party\\" and that it was his own initiative, but written with Brash's co-operation. But as investigative journalist Nicky Hager in his book The Hollow Men revealed, it was indeed commissioned by the National Party, and was in fact the party's first big budget item in the campaign. Hager quotes a 21 May 2004 email from Brash to Richard Long, who was his chief of staff, where a proposal from Christchurch publisher Willson Scott for the biography was discussed. Long replied two days later that he had discussed the book with Goldsmith, and Brash in reply wanted political historian Michael Bassett [a personal friend of Brash] to be considered, The book was eventually commissioned with Goldsmith, and was paid for by National Party donors through a company called Silverbeat, which belonged to Brash's assistant Bryan Sinclair. National Party staff supplied Goldsmith with a collections of papers for the book, and Goldsmith first interviewed Brash in July 2004. Within weeks, Goldsmith supplied the first drafts to National Party staff, and the book was written in such a complimentary way that Brash commented on the final chapter: \\"I do not have a single word I would change\\". The working relationship with Brash got so close that Goldsmith even got to review a draft version of Brash's second Orewa Speech (dubbed Orewa 2); Goldsmith returned his draft to Brash on 10 November 2004, and some of the lines were kept for 25 January 2005 speech delivery. Whilst the book was under production, Brash's team of advisers strategised how the biography could be used to best effect, or \\"as a significant marketing tool\\", as Brash himself called it in a 27 March 2005 email. To give the impression that the book was independently written was made more complicated by Goldsmith becoming a candidate in the electorate during the book production, something that Long had advised against by stating that he had \\"warned the party and Goldsmith months ago that his candidacy would undermine the authority of the book and [he] urged him to hold off till next time\\". The biography was launched on 28 February 2005 in Auckland. Although it was nominally a project by the publisher Penguin Books, all arrangements for the launch were made by Sinclair. From a 15 February email from Goldsmith to Sinclair that contained a draft invite list that have four National Party donors listed immediately after Goldsmith's family but before his friends and with specific reference to \\"the above 4 ... need courtesy to invite\\", Hager thinks that it is possible that Doug Myers, Alan Gibbs, Craig Heatley, and David Richwhite were the ones who paid for the production of the biography. As such, the production costs of the biography do not form part of the election costs declared by the National Party for the 2005 campaign. Member of Parliament Goldsmith contested the Maungakiekie electorate in the 2005 general election for the National Party. He was defeated by the incumbent, Labour's Mark Gosche, and due to his low list placing (59 on the National Party list), he did not enter Parliament. He successfully stood for the Auckland City Council in the 2007 local body elections. He was appointed deputy finance chairman by Mayor John Banks and chaired the community services committee. He stood for Citizens & Ratepayers in the Albert-Eden-Roskill ward at the 2010 Auckland elections but placed third after Christine Fletcher and Cathy Casey in the two-member ward. Goldsmith stood in the Epsom electorate at the 2011 general election, but lost the electorate vote to John Banks, who earlier in 2011 had joined ACT New Zealand. Goldsmith was ranked 39th on the National Party list and was elected as a list MP sitting in the 50th Parliament. Goldsmith was then ranked 30th on the National Party list, and was re-elected as a list MP in the to the 51st Parliament. He was a Cabinet Minister in the 5th National Government, holding the portfolios of Science and Innovation, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, and Regulatory Reform. Since 25 March 2020, Goldsmith has been a member of the Epidemic Response Committee, a select committee that considers the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Private life Goldsmith is married with four children. He is a 2nd dan black belt in Tae Kwon Do.

In 1992 she was a news interviewer for TV2's Counterpoint, and she was news presenter for Primetime in 1993. Barry's garden show, originally titled Palmers Garden Show but renamed to Maggie's Garden Show, ran on TV ONE from 1991 to 2003, with her as co-producer and presenter. Featured were ‚Äòbug man‚Äô Ruud Kleinpaste, gardening experts Bill Ward, Jack Hobbs, Gordon Collier and Professor Thomas William Walker (\\"John Walker\\"). She also produced several television documentaries. In the 1996 Queen's Birthday Honours, Barry was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to broadcasting. Barry has written for the New Zealand Listener since 2007, producing a fortnightly gardening column and occasional interview articles. She hosted Radio Live Drive from March 2009 to December 2010. Member of Parliament = First term = Barry was interested in standing for the National Party in the 2011 Botany by-election, but did not become the candidate. She was selected as the National candidate for the safe seat of North Shore in May 2011 after the sitting MP Wayne Mapp decided not to run in the 2011 general election. Placed in number 57 on the National Party list, Barry was elected to Parliament by winning the electorate vote with an increased majority of 41.87% over her nearest rival, a Labour Party candidate. She also increased the Party Vote to 62.16%, 45.9% clear of the Labour Party. Barry became a member of the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee upon entering parliament; she was appointed its Deputy Chairperson in 2013. In 2014 she became Chairperson of the Local Government and Environment Select Committee, and stood down from Finance and Expenditure and instead became a member of the Education and Science Select Committee. During the 2011 election campaign Barry was spat at in Devonport, which appeared to shock her.'Shaken', 'shocked' Nats Maggie Barry spat at on Shore New Zealand Herald, 22 November 2011 In July 2012, Barry was mocked on social media for suggesting during a debate on paid parental leave that Jacinda Ardern could not speak with authority on the subject because of her (then) childless status. = Second term, and promotion to Cabinet = On 6 October 2014, Prime Minister John Key appointed Barry to the portfolios of Minister for Arts, Culture & Heritage, Minister of Conservation, and Minister for Senior Citizens. She was ranked 20th in Cabinet under the Key Ministry. After Prime Minister Key's resignation, Prime Minister Bill English reshuffled the Cabinet. Barry retained all three of her portfolios and was ranked 16th.  Minister of Arts, Culture, and Heritage  World War I 100th anniversary celebrations have been taking place since Barry took office. As Minister she has been in charge of the World War 100 celebrations, which include commemorations within New Zealand and overseas. While World War 100 is based within the Arts, Culture, and Heritage Ministry, it relied on support from Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Defence Force and the Department of Internal Affairs. When Bill English became Leader of the National Party, and subsequently Prime Minister, he disestablished the post of Minister of Broadcasting, absorbing it into Barry's Arts, Culture, and Heritage Portfolio.  Minister of Conservation  As Minister of Conservation, Barry launched Predator Free 2050, a programme to ensure that New Zealand's native animals were free from being attacked by predators. It looks at controlling predators using community volunteers, private residents, philanthropists and government investment. With over 80% of New Zealand's birds and reptiles endangered, Predator Free 2050 focuses on protecting these species from rats, stoats, possums, weasels and ferrets. In 2015, Barry urged the SPCA to put down stray cats instead of just neutering and releasing them.  Minister for Senior Citizens  Under Prime Minister Bill English, National launched a policy to increase the superannuation age from 65 to 67. As Minister for Seniors much of the groundwork for implementing this policy falls under Barry's portfolio. During the difficulties with the switch over from senior citizens being able to use their gold card on buses, to having to use an AT HOP card, Barry announced that the Ministry of Social Development, in which the Office of Seniors sits, would be assisting with the changeover. = Third term = After the 2017 general election, Barry retained her cabinet portfolios as Caretaker Minister. However once Winston Peters announced that he was to form a coalition with the Labour Party, National returned to opposition and Barry lost her government roles. She retained her position in the Party's ranks and her role within the Party as Spokesperson for Conservation. Barry did retain her electorate seat with a majority of 12,716, down on 16,503 the previous election, despite her personal vote only falling by a few hundred. She was elected Deputy Chair of the Environment Select Committee. During the 2018 leadership election, Barry ruled herself out as a contender and then endorsed Amy Adams as National leader. When Simon Bridges was elected leader, Barry was demoted to 25 on the party list from 17, and lost her spokesperson for conservation role. She instead picked up, Seniors, Veterans, and Associate Health. She was appointed as Deputy Chair of the Justice Select Committee on 21 March 2018, leaving the Environment Select Committee. While on the Justice Select Committee Barry voiced her opposition to the End of Life Choice Bill, proposed by ACT's David Seymour, which would allow assisted suicide, a concept Barry had always been opposed to. During the hearings, Barry was accused of bias and being disparaging to submitters. Barry faced accusations that she bullied staff during her time as a Minister and whilst in opposition ‚Äì allegedly having been investigated for bullying twice in 2018. Barry vigorously denied the claims that she bullied staff and that she used derogatory terms to describe members of Auckland Council's local boards despite recordings showing evidence of this. Beyond this, it was also alleged that Barry used Parliamentary Services staff members to complete National Party work during working hours, which is against the law. She denied this allegation as well despite emails showing this was not the case. The ex staffer who went to the media gave an exclusive interview to Radio New Zealand in which he spoke, under voice disguise, about how Barry treated him and other staff. He spoke of how 'It was Jekyll and Hyde stuff', and that another staff member left and took a personal grievance, which he did not know the outcome of. Two other former staffers came forward to support his allegations stated that as a Minister she would refer to Ministry staffers as 'hired help' and that she would scream at people and blame them for her mistakes. Throughout the media attention on these issues Barry stated that 'I do not accept that there has been bullying and harassment in my workplace, I would not approve of that at all and I am not that kind of employer.' She emerged in a brief press conference backed by fellow MPs, Mark Mitchell, Simon O'Connor, and Nikki Kaye. Party leader, Simon Bridges continued to endorse her assurances of innocence. A complaint was laid to the Auditor-General on 5 December 2018, that Barry had effectively misappropriated public funds for the use of party work by requiring Parliamentary Services staff to do Party work during Parliamentary hours, she was later cleared of any wrongdoing in a report released by Parliamentary Services in July 2019. In June 2019, she was made the National Party's spokesperson for Disability Issues, in addition to her other portfolios. In September 2019, Barry was again accused of bullying behaviour this time by a fellow MP on behalf of one of their party colleagues. Senior Labour MP, former Cabinet Minister, party Whip, and the Assistant Speaker, Hon Ruth Dyson, told media that Barry had \\"stood and started yelling then and yelled pretty much down to the table, and then just carried on yelling at me, standing right next to the table\\". Dyson accepted the apology which Barry gave to her via a speech in the House. Labour MP, Kieran McAnulty said Barry by \\"openly and aggressively verbally and physically challenging\\" she had breached standing orders, and he intended to recommend the privileges committee censure her. In early November 2019, Barry announced that she would not be standing for re-election at the 2020 general election. Personal life Barry is married to Grant Kerr, who is a lawyer. She has a son. A hybrid tea rose dark pink rose has been named after Barry. In the late 1990s she was a lay representative from the National Health Committee advising the Minister of Health, and was involved in reports on palliative care, cancer, and maternity services. She was the Chair of the Board of the New Zealand Book Council in 2006. Barry has been a patron for the Mary Potter Hospice, Alzheimer's Wellington, and Hospice New Zealand. On 4 July 2014, Barry said that she was groped by Australian entertainer Rolf Harris when he was in New Zealand during the 1980s and she was recording an interview she hosted from Palmerston North. She said that Harris \\"came into the studio and they sat down and then he started to do the old wandering hands thing and she stood up and said 'well you can stop that right now'.\\" Barry also said that he turned nasty on her before switching his charm back for the interview.\\"Maggie Barry: I was groped by Rolf Harris\\". New Zealand Herald, dated 2014-07-04, viewed 21 July 2014 At the time, a similar celebrity sexual conduct case was in the news, and retired parliamentarian Rodney Hide taunted Barry in his newspaper column, urging her to use her parliamentary privilege to breach the name suppression order against the defendant in the Queenstown suppressed indecency case.\\"Rodney Hide: Forget Rolf, Maggie.

He is a member of the National Party. Early life Mitchell was born on Auckland's North Shore and lived his early years at Whenuapai air base, where his father was a flight lieutenant and his mother's father, Air Commodore Frank Gill, was the base commander. Gill was later a National Party cabinet minister, between 1975 and 1980. Mitchell attended Rosmini College. He was in the New Zealand Police for thirteen years from 1989 to 2002, including time as a dog handler and in the Armed Offenders Squad. After leaving the police, Mitchell undertook an executive education short course at Wharton Business School. Mitchell worked for eight years as a private security contractor and spent time in Iraq, including the siege of the Italian-run An Nasiriyah compound in Southern Iraq by the Mahdi militia in 2004.In the line of duty Sunday Star Times, 27 March 2011 Member of Parliament =Fifth National Government, 2011-2017= Mitchell was selected as the National Party's candidate for Rodney on 26 April 2011, replacing Lockwood Smith.National selects Mark Mitchell for Rodney stuff.co.nz, 26 April 2011 Mitchell voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand. In 2014, Nicky Hager's book Dirty Politics presented evidence which suggested that Mitchell had hired political strategist Simon Lusk during the National Party selection process for the Rodney electorate. Lusk appeared to have collaborated with blogger Cameron Slater to discredit Mitchell's opponents, particularly Brent Robinson. Mitchell strongly denies ever paying Lusk or Slater. He served as Chairperson of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee from the 2014 general election, before being appointed Minister for Land Information and Minister of Statistics in December 2016. In May 2017, he was promoted to Cabinet and became the Minister of Defence, while dropping the Statistics portfolio. In 2017, Mitchell said he would not quit politics if National lost the 2017 general election. =Coalition Government, 2017-present= During the 2017 general election, Mark Mitchell was re-elected in the Rodney electorate, defeating Labour candidate Marja Lubeck by a margin of 19,561 votes. Following the formation of a Labour-led coalition government, Mitchell was appointed as National's Spokesperson for the defence, disarmament, and justice portfolios. On 22 January 2019, he was designated as National's Spokesperson for Pike River Re-entry. Following the resignation of short lived National party leader Todd Muller on 14 July 2020, Mitchell ran against fellow MP Judith Collins for the position of Leader of the National Party, ultimately he lost the election for the position as he was not able to get the required 29 members of the National caucus to back him, although it is known that former National leader Simon Bridges had given his support to Mitchell. During the 2020 New Zealand general election, it was speculated that Mitchell would challenge Collins for the leadership following their historic landslide defeat, which saw them drop a NET 19 seats in Parliament, although he quickly ruled this out.

He is a former president of the Law Society of Hong Kong and chairman of the Tuen Mun Rural Committee and served as an elected member of the Tuen Mun District Council from 2015 to 2019.  Early life  Ho came from a family of village leaders. He grew up in the old site of Leung Tin Village () in Tuen Mun. He is a 32nd-generation descendant of his Hakka clan, which can be traced back to the 10th century. Ho attended Queen's College Hong Kong from 1975 to 1979, after which he went to the United Kingdom, where he enrolled at Chelmer Institute of Higher Education and obtained his bachelor of laws degree in 1984. Ho joined a post-graduate programme at the University of Hong Kong in 1984 and obtained his mandatory practising qualification, the postgraduate certificate in laws (PCLL) in 1986.  Legal career  After gaining his qualifications he was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in 1988 and similarly admitted in Singapore, and England and Wales in 1995 and 1997.Law List ‚Äì The Law Society of Hong Kong He is the senior partner of a law firm in Hong Kong and a principal representative of a law firm in Guangzhou. His major practice field is civil litigation, specialising in shareholders' disputes and family disputes. He was appointed a China-Appointed Attesting Officer in 2003.

It was reported that the individual by the name of \\"Junius Kwan-Yiu Ho\\" does not appear to be on the SRA's records. The dispute, however, was later clarified, for a member by the name of \\"Kwan Yiu Ho\\" does appear to be on SRA's records. = Honorary awards =  Anglia Ruskin University  In 2011, Junius Ho was bestowed with an Honorary Doctor of Laws by Anglia Ruskin University, with the university describing him as an \\"outstanding ambassador\\". After the 2019 Yuen Long attack, an online petition via Change.org was launched urging Anglia Ruskin University to reconsider the honorary award, and the university was notified after the petition reached 500 signatures on 25 July 2019. On 26 October, Lord Alton of Liverpool published a letter addressed to the vice-chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University, requesting the university to consider removing Ho's honorary doctorate, citing alleged examples of \\"misogyny\\", \\"extremism\\" and \\"racism\\". On 28 October 2019, Anglia Ruskin University withdrew Ho's honorary degree following an investigation, with a statement from the university noting, \\"Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern\\".  China University of Political Science and Law  On 6 December 2019, Ho received an honorary law doctorate at the China University of Political Science and Law for his \\"outstanding contribution and achievements in the legal sector\\".  Political career  Ho first contested a Legislative Council election in 2008, running against Civic Party's Margaret Ng in the Legal functional constituency. He was defeated, receiving 1,286 votes, about 34 percent of the vote. Ho was elected as Chairman of Tuen Mun Rural Committee in 2011, ousting the long-time chairman and most powerful rural leader Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Heung Yee Kuk. In that capacity, he became an ex officio member of the Tuen Mun District Council. He served as the rural committee chairman until 2015. He was a candidate in the Legislative Council election in New Territories West in September 2012, where he received 10,805 votes, about two per cent of total vote share and was not elected. Ho was appointed to Lingnan University council by Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying in October 2015. Students staged a protest against the appointment over fears of political interference in university governance. In the 2015 District Council elections, Junius Ho defeated Albert Ho of the Democratic Party in the latter's long-held Lok Tsui seat in a six-way contest by a narrow margin of 277 votes, as the pro- democracy votes were split between Albert Ho and Cheng Chung-tai of Civic Passion. Ho ran again in the 2016 Legislative Council election for the New Territories West. During the election, Ho's supporters were allegedly involved in the withdrawal of candidacy of Liberal Party candidate Ken Chow Wing-kan. Chow claimed he had been intimidated after receiving threats made against him. On the following day, Ho identified that some of the threats were made by one of his volunteers that had helped him for about one or two months; but Ho defended him by stating that the volunteer only wanted to be angry for him. Ho was elected with 35,657 votes, winning the last of nine seats in the constituency. In May 2017, pro-democracy lawyer Kevin Yam published an article urging solicitors not to vote for Junius Ho in the election for the governing council of the Law Society of Hong Kong. Ho sued for defamation but failed to be re-elected, securing only 572 of 8,148 votes, coming last. In the 2019 District Council elections, Ho with 2,626 votes lost his seat to his rival Lo Chun-yu who had 1,213 more votes. = Alleged conflicts of interest = On 25 April 2018, it was reported that Ho's family business holds the ownership of 120,000 square feet of farmland southwest of the Fanling Golf Course. Ho had previously voted against a motion to request the government to seize the golf course for housing redevelopment, but did not declare any potential conflict of interests. Ho responded that the motion did not impact his family business and therefore reporting his interests was not required. On 2 May 2018, lawmaker, Andrew Wan, filed a complaint to the legislative committee accusing Ho of failing to declare two properties that is associated to his family's company, Profit Trade Investment Ltd and other subsidiaries. One of which was an apartment located at Sham Shui Po that was allegedly sold at four times its estimated value. Wan alleged that there could potentially be a conflict of interest if related issues come up in the legislative council. On 5 May 2018, Ho admitted that Profit Trade had ownership of his family assets, but maintained that the company does not involve any conflict of interest in the Legislative Council and therefore such interests need not to be disclosed. =Victim of Tuen Mun knife attack= On 6 November 2019, in preparation for the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, Junius Ho ran a campaign event in Tuen Mun. He was approached by a man posing as a supporter, who attacked him with a 33-centimetre-long knife that left him bleeding in the chest. The attacker was shortly subdued. Ho was briefly hospitalized.  Political views  = Same- sex marriage = Ho has made several controversial statements regarding issues related to the LGBT community. In late April 2017, following a lawsuit on government benefits for civil workers who are in a same-sex relationship, Ho said that the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Hong Kong would lead to the acceptance of bestiality and incest. Ho's remarks were criticised by other LegCo members. For instance, Raymond Chan, who is an openly gay LegCo member, strongly condemned Ho's comments. In May 2017, Ho said that a ruling granting marriage benefits to a gay civil servant could lead to \\"chaos in society\\" and co-signed a petition asking the government to appeal the decision. In April 2018, Ho became the only legislator to vote against the appointments of foreign judges Brenda Hale and Beverley McLachlin to the Court of Final Appeal over their support of same-sex rights, claiming the two opposed traditional family values. =Tiananmen Square memorialization motion= On June 2017, Junius Ho became the only pro-establishment lawmaker to vote in favour of a motion to memorialize the 4 June 1989 massacre of Tiananmen Square protestors at the Legislative Council. He expressed sympathy for the Chinese students before the People's Liberation Army crackdown. = Opposition to Occupy Central with Love and Peace = Ho was a leading critic of legal scholar Benny Tai's Occupy Central with Love and Peace which suggested a full-scale occupation protest in the form of civil disobedience to press the Beijing government to make concessions on electoral reform. He set up an anti-Occupy group called \\"Protect Central\\" which he said would resist the Occupy campaign. In August 2017, Ho called for the removal of Tai, who was then facing charges of inciting others to incite public nuisance, from working at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). Vice-Chancellor Peter Mathieson and council chairman Arthur Li rejected the call. In September 2017, Ho submitted a petition urging the University of Hong Kong to investigate Tai and organised a rally calling for his removal. During the rally, one of Ho's guest speakers, rural leader Tsang Shu-wo, said onstage that supporters of Hong Kong independence separatist movement ought to be \\"killed\\" (ÊÆ∫). It is reported that Ho then shouted the phrase (ÁÑ°Ëµ¶) which can mean \\"no amnesty\\" or \\"no mercy\\" into his microphone. After the rally, there were many allegations made against Ho, claiming that Ho was inciting the killing of Hong Kong independence supporters. Twenty-two lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp issued a joint statement condemning Ho's remarks. Other government officials have also alluded that Ho's comments was inappropriate. Ho accused the media for taking his words out of context, and he maintained that he was expressing his contempt at the pro-independence movement. When asked about the phrase in question on a radio programme, Ho explained that inciting Hong Kong's independence is a declaration of war, and concluded that \\"to kill them without mercy means we deplore wrongdoers like our enemies.\\" Senior Counsel Ronny Tong said that Ho may have also violated the Public Order Ordinance, which criminalises disorder in public places. Later on 23 September 2017, the Commissioner of Police at the time, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, said that Ho's remarks would be investigated. On 20 April 2018, it was reported that there is insufficient proof to prosecute the lawmaker. Controversies =Alleged involvement in Yuen Long attack = Prior to the 2019 Yuen Long attack, Ho was filmed reportedly supporting and congratulating a group of white-clad men. When confronted about his alleged involvement in the Yuen Long Attack, Ho claimed that he was simply there greeting some of his supporters, and said it was normal because he lives in Yuen Long. After the incident, Ho said that the white-clad men were only \\"defending their home and people\\". On 22 July 2019 Ho's constituency shopfront in Tsuen Wan was turned into a Lennon Wall before being ransacked later in the day. Ho's Tuen Mun office also attracted protests on the following day. In response to Ho's alleged involvement, over 2,300 teachers, alumni and students from Ho's alma mater Queen's College participated in a signature campaign condemning Ho. They urged LegCo members to impeach Ho, and requested Queen's College Old Boys' Association to suspend his membership. Similarly, Lingnan University students have started a petition calling for Ho to be removed from the institution's governing council. An online petition requesting that the United States bar Ho and his family from entering the U.S. or acquiring U.S. citizenship achieved over 100,000 signatures. On 23 July 2019, Ho appeared on an RTHK televised forum alongside fellow New Territories West constituency representative Eddie Chu. Ho said he did not regret shaking hands with the attackers. He called the victims of the Yuen Long attacks \\"rioters\\" and claimed they had instigated the violence. He said the mobs were mere \\"Yuen Long residents\\" seeking to \\"protect their homeland\\". After Chu stated that protesters could not remain calm if the government continued to ignore their requests (e.g. to formally withdraw the extradition bill), Ho called Chu a \\"scum\\" who \\"did not deserve to be a lawmaker\\" while storming off stage, ending the interview. Later, when Ho's parents' graves were vandalized, Ho accused Chu and his supporters for the damage. In one of Ho's video postings on social media, it was reported that Ho warned Chu in Cantonese that he has two paths to choose from. One of which is \\"a path of being alive, (and the other) is a path of not being alive.\\" Chu dismissed the threat and stated that it was merely Ho's style of talking. Chu, however, added that it was also a way for Ho to lead his supporters into believing that he was culpable for the damage to Ho's parents' tomb. = Insults = During a 2019 Legislative Council meeting, Ho made a remark directed toward fellow Legislative Council member Claudia Mo, stating that she is used to \\"eating foreign sausage\\". Mo, who is married to English journalist Philip Bowring, later told the council that the comment amounts to racism and sexual harassment. Ho refused to apologise and was expelled from the meeting.

In 1925 he made a return to the VFL, with Hawthorn entering the competition. An in-and-out 1925 season as a forward turned around when Lethlean was placed in defence and used as a relief follower. His bulk, guile and tenacity made him well suited to the role, and he became a key contributor over the next few seasons. Lethlean was elected captain of the side in 1927, where he gave good service as a ruckman during an injury crisis, despite missing four games through suspension. The 1927 VFL season was his final year at Hawthorn. Clarrie Lethlean married Elva Margaret Roemus in 1925 and they had three sons together.

The windows of her private apartment overlooking the garden are visible in the background. The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn Pavlovsk Park in summer The Pavlovsk Park () is the park surrounding the Pavlovsk Palace, an 18th-century Russian Imperial residence built by Tsar Paul I of Russia near Saint Petersburg. After his death, it became the home of his widow, Maria Feodorovna. It is now a state museum and a public park. Design and conception The park was conceived by the Scottish architect Charles Cameron as a classic English landscape garden, an idealized landscape filled with picturesque pieces of classical architecture, designed to surprise and please the viewer. Like the English landscape garden, it took much its inspiration from the romanticized landscape paintings of Claude Lorraine and Hubert Robert. The gallery of Pavlovsk has twelve landscape paintings by Hubert Robert that were commissioned by Maria Feodorovna. Its inspiration lay not in England but in continental gardens that Maria Feodorovna and her husband had seen in a tour of western Europe in 1782, during which they travelled incognito as the \\"Count and Countess du Nord\\". They visited her family's park at W√ºrttemberg, where Maria Feodorovna had grown up, and were impressed by the Petit Trianon in the grounds of the Palace of Versailles in France. The deepest impression, however, was made by the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly and especially by the hameau or mock-rustic hamlet built on the Chantilly estate by the Prince of Cond√©. Paul told the Prince that he would give all he had for Chantilly, and years later, when Cameron was laying out the Pavlovsk Park, features from Chantilly and W√ºrttemberg were reproduced to give Paul and Maria Feodorovna their own versions of their favourite elements of those parks. Cameron laid out a triple alley of five straight rows of Linden trees, imported from L√ºbeck, in a long axis from the courtyard of the Palace, leading to a small semi-circular place in the forest. This served as a parade ground for Tsar Paul's Imperial guards. In the forest to the left of this axis he placed a romantic thatch-roofed dairy with stalls for two cows modeled after the one in the park of W√ºrttemberg; and on the other side of the parade route, an aviary, filled with parakeets, nightingales, starlings, and quail. This part of the garden also included a labyrinth, and picturesque tombstones imported from Italy. An early French visitor described the effect of this part of the garden: \\"Melancholy consumes the soul when you arrive...then the pain is followed by pleasure.\\" Saint-Maure, E., Anthologie russe, Paris, 1823 p. 247. Marie Feodorovna was deeply interested in botany. In 1801, Cameron constructed an elegant flower garden behind the Palace, just outside the windows of the private apartment of Marie Feodorovna. Next to the garden was a Greek temple containing a statue of the Three Graces, looking down at the river. She imported flowers from Holland for her garden, including hyacinth, tulips, daffodils and narcissus. She also constructed an orangery and several greenhouses where she grew apricots, cherries, peaches, grapes and pineapples. The River Slavyanovka was the picturesque axis of the composition, with winding paths along the river providing changing views to the visitor. A dam turned the river into a picturesque pond in the valley below the Palace. In 1780, Cameron constructed a large Roman temple at a turn in the river in the bottom of the valley. The classical temple, similar to the Temple of Pan in the gardens at Stowe House in England. It was originally called the Temple of Gratitude, dedicated to Catherine the Great, who had donated the land for the Park, but in 1780 it was renamed the Temple of Friendship, in honor of the visit to Pavlovsk of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, 298 Between 1780 and 1783, at the top of the hill which descended to the lake, Cameron constructed a colonnade with a copy of the Apollo Belvedere in Rome.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, 296 19th century Pavlovsk Park in 1845; by Alexey Voloskov. The Pavilion of the \\"Three Graces\\" can be seen in the background. By the early 19th century, the Park at Pavlovsk had gardens representing many different styles. A formal and geometric garden √† la fran√ßaise was planted near the Palace. An Italian garden, with parterres, classical statues and a grand staircase was created by Brenna on the hillside overlooking the lake. Cameron used the intimate Dutch style for the little private garden outside Maria Feodorovna's private apartments, and the huge park was in the style of the English and French landscape garden. An English visitor, John Lowden, who saw Pavlovsk during the war against Napoleon in 1812, wrote that Pavlovsk Park was the most beautiful example of the English landscape garden in all of the Russian Empire.Lowden, John, The Encyclopedia of Gardening, London, 1827, p. 26. Beginning in 1792, the chief architect of the Pavlovsk Park was the Italian landscape architect and painter, Pietro Gonzaga, who had begun his career as a set designer at the La Scala Theater in Milan. Gonzaga always remained a theater designer; he designed the funeral procession of Catherine the Great, Paul I, and Alexander I. as well as the Coronations of Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. For Cameron he painted landscape scenes of the Pavlovsk Park on the walls and ceilings of rooms of the Palace, and he designed spectacular sets for the 1814 ceremony at Pavlovsk welcoming Alexander I home after his victory over Napoleon.Massie, 310 Gonzaga planned the landscape of Pavlovsk Park with meticulous care, marking the trees to be saved or cut down. He laid out paths and changed contours to create the effects he wanted, using open and closed spaces and different colors and shapes of trees to make theatrical scenes. He made dramatic use of the contrast between the white bark and light leaves of birch trees and the dark needles of red-brown trunks of pine trees, setting groups of birch trees in front of dark backgrounds of pines. He also made decorative use of the different seasons in the Park, painting scenes with brilliant colors of the autumn leaves. Gonzaga was the architect of Pavlovsk Park until his death in 1831 at the age of eighty.Massie, 92  References  Bibliography *Orloff, Alexandre and Chvidkovski, Dimitri, Saint-Petersbourg- l'architecture des tsars, Editions Place des Victoires, Paris 1995, translated from Russian to French by Brigitte de Monclos, *Massie, Suzanne, Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace, Hodder & Stoughton,1990, .

I could sense there was immense potential in Tiago and his band, but I wanted to move them away from that clean, careful sound and see the music evolve towards something darker, grittier and more complex, which I felt would make his unusual voice stand out even that much more.

But in ancient times, people living by the Yellow River often suffered its floods. Xuzhou was one such city. Located by the after-bay of the Yellow River, Xuzhou suffered from Yellow River floods since the Han Dynasty until the Yellow River changed its course in 1855, the 5th Year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty (). During the years that the Yellow River passed Xuzhou, the city was flooded more than 400 times, ten times in the Qin and Han Dynasty, 19 times in the Wei and Jin () Dynasty, 20 times in the Sui and Tang Dynasty, 50 times in the Liao, Song and Yuan Dynasty, 120 times, and two hundred and three times in the Qin Dynasty.  Five heaviest floods recorded  The earliest flood recorded happened in 132 B.C., the 3rd Year of Yuanguang () in the West Han Dynasty (206‚Äì9 B.C.). One of the major dams built in Hu Zi, Puyang, He‚Äônan () was suddenly burst and the river flooded 16 cities by the after-bay. Due to the blocked watercourse in Hu Zi in the 2nd Year of Yuanfeng (), the Yellow River changed its course to flow through Xuzhou. The flood continued for 24 years. Worried about the terrible situation, Emperor Han Wudi (156‚Äì87 B.C.) wrote down \\"Huzi ge\\" () to express his sorrow and deep concern for the people in the flooded areas. In 1077 A.D., the 10th Year of Xining, Song Dynasty (), the river broke its banks in Tanzhou (). The flood was just surrounding the city wall of Xuzhou and the depth of the water reached two Zhang and eight Chi (). Owing to the efforts of the official head Su Shi (ËãèËΩº), solidifying the dam and keeping the city in order, the water didn‚Äôt rise above the wall and flow into the city; no one was hurt. The other heaviest floods all happened in the Ming Dynasty. The floods of the Ming Dynasty have been more severe than in other dynasties. In the 5th Year of Longqing (), the river broke and poured into the city from the west gate, which resulted in thousands of houses ruined and countless citizens killed. In 1590 A.D., the 18th Year of Wanli (), undulated by the pouring Autumn rain, Xuzhou city was flooded again. Houses were all submerged and the flood continued for two years. After that the city was advised to move somewhere else, but the central government did not approved of it. The most serious flood in Xuzhou‚Äôs history happened on 16 July 1624 A.D., the 4th Year of Tianqi (). Happening at midnight, the flood poured into the city and the southeast wall of the city collapsed. The depth of the water in the city reached more than four meters. Not being prepared for the sudden flood, citizens had to leave the flooded houses and move to Mountain YunlongSee: (‰∫ëÈæôÂ±±) to escape the flood. Since the Yellow River is the river which has the greatest concentration of sediment in the world, Xuzhou was buried completely by the sand of the Yellow River after the flood went back down, with the height of the sand accumulation ranging from one to ten meters. The relocation of the city was proposed again but was still denied by the central government. People had to rebuild the city right above the buried one.  Influence of the floods  The loss of agricultural production and the loss of public and private possessions were inevitable. = The Abandoned Yellow River = The Yellow River changed its course in the 5th Year of Xianfeng, Qing Dynasty and never passed Xuzhou again, so the river course in Xuzhou was abandoned. Now the Abandoned Yellow River has become a famous tourist attraction in Xuzhou. In the Abandoned River park, there are five posts standing by the shore with the flood history recorded on them called Shui Jing Shi Zhu Ji ().http://sqtg.cnxz.com.cn/xzrb/html/2010-01/26/content_368409.htm = The underground city = After the flood in 1624, people in Xuzhou built a new city resembling to the buried one. In the 1950s, part of the buried one was found. The old city was gradually exposed in the following 50 years‚Äô excavation. The underground city has an essential meaning to the origin, development and evolution of Xuzhou City.

Present  Nikolskie ryady in 2011 In September 2006 a construction company said that \\"Nikolskie ryady\\" required complete reconstruction which would take between 30 and 36 months. This is because the building required the complete replacement of its systems for utilities like electricity, heating and water. The work proposed involved keeping the historic facade and dimensions.:director of construction company George Grehnev Two years later however the buildings tenants noted that 70% of the building could be classified as in an emergency condition. A project was proposed that actually involved demolishing about 50% of the building although it would still retain the building's facade and the gallery (illustrated). This would regain that part of the building that was currently unoccupied and create a hotel complex, a market and two-storey underground parking. In May, 2008 the Committee on State Control, Use and Protection of Monuments of History and Culture disagreed with the assessment of the status of the building. However the dates of reconstruction (2010), and the cost of renovation ($200 million) were announced. The Committee, represented by its director, Vera Dementieva, proposed financial assistance to investors, controlled by Andrei Yakunin (son of the head of JSC \\"RZD\\" Vladimir Yakunin), which they said was necessary for the complete restoration of the building. At November 19, 2010 Nikolskie ryady market was sold at auction to the organization, which conducts the restoration work.

Prior to December 1864, when the scouts were established, the Pawnee frequently skirmished with neighboring tribes. When General Samuel Ryan Curtis began recruiting for scouts to help him in an offensive against other tribes in the region, he convinced seventy Pawnee to join him. Shortly thereafter, First Lieutenant Frank North was authorized to recruit 100 more Pawnee. North would eventually be put in command of the scouts and promoted to captain and then major, a position he held until the final disbandment of the unit in 1877. The first Pawnee scouts were posted at Fort Kearny, Nebraska and later units served at Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming and at Sydney Barracks. From May to November, the Pawnee scouts were in General Patrick E. Connor's Powder River Expedition and first saw action on August 13, 1865, at Crazy Woman's Fork of the Powder River. Their second skirmish on August 16, 1865, also at Powder River. Captain North was following the trail of about 27 retreating Cheyenne with about forty-five of his scouts when they discovered the Cheyenne camp. During the following attack by North's forces, all twenty-seven Southern Cheyenne men, women, and children were killed by Captain North and his Scouts who only suffered four horses killed.Major Frank J. North of Pawnee Scouts - Obituary The scouts served in the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29. In the fight, about 200 United States soldiers and 70 Indian Scouts (including 30 of the Pawnee) captured an Arapaho village containing about 500 people, mostly women and children, under Medicine Man. The few Arapaho warriors counterattacked but were repulsed by the soldiers' repeating carbine's and mountain howitzer's fire. Sixty-three Arapahos, mostly unarmed noncombatants were killed. Eighteen women and children were captured and later released. Hundreds of Arapaho horses and ponies were shot after the battle. Five U.S. soldiers and Indian Scouts were killed or mortally wounded and an additional two were wounded in the battle.Wyoming State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails - Connor Battlefield Historic Site McDermott, pg. 112 =Cheyenne War= In the spring of 1866, after the expedition into the Powder River Country, the Pawnee scouts were temporarily disbanded. In March 1867 Major North was authorized to enlist four, fifty-man companies of scouts for protecting the Union Pacific Railroad, then under construction. During this time, Major North was accompanied by his brother, Luther, who was in command of one of the scout companies. The \\"Pawnee Battalion\\", as it was called, was active in the Comanche War, fighting against Chief Turkey Leg and his band of Northern Cheyenne. A \\"severe\\" engagement took place near Plum Creek Station, Nebraska, on August 22, in which Major North and forty-two of the scouts engaged 150 Oglala Lakota and Cheyenne warriors who had destroyed a train on August 6, killing seven settlers and taking a large amount of private property. The Pawnee scouts killed \\"many\\", and captured Turkey Leg's wife and child. The chief's family was later exchanged for three captured American girls and two boys who were held by Turkey Leg for a long time. In the autumn of 1867 the battalion was mustered out but in the spring of 1868 North reorganized the unit to continue protecting the Union Pacific. In 1869, North and fifty scouts guided Colonel Eugene Asa Carr's Republican River Expedition through Colorado and fought in the Battle of Summit Springs on July 11. The battle put approximately 300 Americans and Pawnees up against 450 to 900 encamped Arapaho, Sioux and Cheyenne under the command of Chief Tall Bull. Carr positioned his forces so as to attack the camp simultaneously from three sides. Thirty-five native men, women and children were killed, including Tall Bull, while only one American was wounded. The scouts were responsible for the deaths of at least seven women and children. Some 800 heads of captured livestock were also taken by the US Army.Andreas' History of the State of Nebraska - Official Roster - Part 15Michno, pg. 207-209Grinnell, pg. 314-315 =Great Sioux War= In 1870 the Pawnee scouts were still working to protect the railroad but eventually they were disbanded. With the outbreak of the Great Sioux War in 1876, Major North was ordered by General Philip Sheridan to travel to Indian Territory, where the Pawnee now lived, to organize another company for General George Crook's Little Bighorn Campaign. Living in poverty, the Pawnee men were willing to enlist for pay. North recruited 100 of the Pawnees and headed back north, to Fort Robinson, Nebraska where the Sioux chiefs Sitting Bull and Red Cloud were active in fighting the army. Major North and his men arrived at the fort on October 22 and immediately thereafter began a march to the camp of Chief Red Cloud with a regiment of cavalry. On the following morning, North's command advanced on the camp and took it, capturing Red Cloud and over 700 ponies which were later sold. The chief and his band were then marched to Fort Robinson and imprisoned there until the end of the war in 1877. In November, 1876, General Ranald S. Mackenzie led seventy Pawnee scouts and 800 cavalrymen into the Big Horn Mountains to attack a \\"well concealed\\" Cheyenne camp. When General Mackenzie launched his attack most fled, leaving their provisions and lodges to be piled up and burnt by the soldiers. Some 650 ponies were also captured and over forty natives died from exposure of starvation in the following weeks. The attack left the Cheyenne destitute. With nowhere to go, some of the Cheyenne walked to Fort Robinson and surrendered. Now that the war was over, the Pawnee scouts were disbanded for good on May 1, 1877, and returned to the Indian Territory. Major North retired from his military life the same year.

The original (lower rope tow) was installed in 1946, the first ski tow in New Zealand (predating Coronet Peak's tow by a few days). This was replaced by the current T Bar in 1974. The top rope tow has a formidable reputation, rising some 300 metres. This was installed in 1952 and upgraded extensively in the 1980s (with a replacement electric drive instead of the old diesel engine). An extension to this tow (running off the top bullwheel) can be installed providing further vertical late in the season. The lower T bar can also carry a few chairs if necessary, something that the Stratford Mountain Club have indicated that they may install, making for an interesting dual lift. There is a small (single loop, no intermediate supports) rope tow between the T bar and the bottom station of the top tow, installed in the 1980s and electrically operated. There is a small learners rope tow to the left of the T bar, this was installed in 1964 and upgraded in the 1970s. A tow was installed in the Ngarara valley to the right of the field in 1983, and this operated til 1986. =Other North Island ski lifts= The Rangiwahia Ski Club installed a rope tow in the 1930s operating off a motorbike engine on the Whanahuia Range in the Ruahines in the Central North Island. The ski club built a hut as well, but this has been replaced by several facilities on the same site since then. Some relics are still there. The site is accessible only on foot. All road ends in Egmont National Park had a rope tow or two at various times, but these have all been removed (apart from Manganui). South Island =Mount Robert (St Arnaud)= Now closed. 3 rope tows originally. =Rainbow (St Arnaud)= Historically: 1 double chairlift (now at Ohau) Currently: 1 T-bar 1 poma 1 learners lift 1 rope tow =Amuri / Hanmer Springs (Hanmer Springs)= Currently 1 pomagalski (the longest in New Zealand), and 1 rope tow. 1 learners tow too. This lift is the only detachable pomagalski left in New Zealand. It was built entirely by volunteers. This lift needs preservation. =Mount Lyford (Kaikoura)= One T-bar Two platters One 180m fixed grip One advanced rope tow extended 2011 There were also two? rope tows installed at Stella Basin, further down the access road from Mt Lyford. A lack of snow has caused these to be removed. =Temple Basin (Arthurs Pass)= 3 rope tows. =Craigieburn Valley (Arthurs Pass)= 3 rope tows currently. Access, middle, and top. Formerly had a learners tow near the base of the middle tow, which resulted in three tows running from one tow shed / engine. The learners tow was removed in the 1990s. The top tow has now been realigned, as the previous alignment resulted in very challenging loading (requiring use of the \\"Craigieburn Drop\\" technique with nutcrackers). In 1952 a T bar was installed (NZs first) running from the bottom of Craigieburn to Siberia Basin, except this never received much usage. A poma was installed on Hamilton Peak in 1994, but this did not receive much use either. The concrete base of this is still sitting in Siberia Basin. There is a cone of death on the dogleg on the bottom rope tow where it changes alignment. It looks like a spinning top with a disc on the top to stop the rope flying off it. The disc acts as angle grinder if you don't get your shoulder far enough out of the way. This was installed to bend the towline away from an avalanche path. Great fun. All tows are diesel operated, using tractors. =Broken River (Arthurs Pass)= Historically: 3 rope tows. 1 access tow, 1 learners tow Currently: * The access tow, from above the accommodation buildings to the field itself. Above the tow shed, which is at the height of Palmer Lodge (the fields day lodge), this tow is known as the Rugby tow, from the former Rugby car engine that used to power it (which is now hanging off the counterweight at the end of the main tow). * The main tow * The ridge tow * Two learners / access tows near Palmer lodge. All tows are electrically driven. =Mount Cheeseman= 2 T bars before it had T bars it had rope tows. The bottom rope tow, since removed, used to extend a long way down the access road. 4WD vehicles would have to wait for skiers before crossing under the rope. The bottom T bar is electric, with the top T bar diesel. The top T bar is perhaps the slowest lift in New Zealand. Faster to walk. =Porters (Arthur's Pass National Park)= 3 T bars 1 x Intermediate Platter lift 1 x SkiMat Magic Carpet lift 1 x Quad Chairlift (2015) =Mount Olympus (Rakaia Valley)= 4 rope tows =Mount Hutt (Methven)= Began in late 1970s with two rope tows Historically * The top T bars - 2 T bars installed side by side, above the top of the old quad. One T bar went halfway to the summit, the second T bar went most of the way to the summit, finishing slightly short of the current six-seater. These were diesel powered. Currently (2010): * The Towers Triple chair with mid-station (one of only two left in operation in New Zealand). Fixed grip. * The Quad (Formerly known as the Exhibition Quad which has been resited - it was formerly the main lift operating from the base buildings of the field, it is now to the right of the base buildings) * The Summit Six seater, operating from the base buildings to near the summit of Mt Hutt at 2086 metres All of these are electrically powered. (2012) add 1 Magic Carpet =Erewhon (Rangitata Valley)= Historically: Four rope tows * Learners tow * Access tow * Main tow * Senior tow Currently: All rope tows were removed when the skifield (and its club) closed in the late 1980s. The lodge is now used as the base of a cat-skiing operation. =Fox Peak (Fairlie)= Currently using 4 rope tows * Skid row learners tow * Meadow tow * Shirt front tow * Apex tow All of these tows run off diesel engines. There is a learners platter lift. =Mount Dobson (Farlie)= Historically: 1 rope tow 1 further rope tow up the peak to the south. Currently: 1 T-bar (installed in the early 1980s) 1 triple chair lift (originally at Perisher in Australia) 1 platter lift =Round Hill (Tekapo)= Originally Tekapo ski area, before it closed in the mid-1990s Historically: * 1 double chair (which went to Rainbow skifield upon closing, and is now just over the valley at Ohau) Currently: * 1 T bar * Learners lifts * The Heritage Express Rope Tow, a nutcracker rope tow which is the longest and (possibly) steepest rope tow in the world. 1.5 km long with 650 metre vertical rise. Installed in 2010. =Ohau (Ohau)= Historically: * 1 rope tow * 1 T-bar (installed in the 1980s) Currently: * 1 double chair, fixed grip, diesel * 1 learners platter Another double chair is in pieces, awaiting installation on an alignment above the current top station of the existing double. =Awakino (Kurow)= Currently running 3 rope tows - 2 nutcracker and one learners tow. The first lift was installed in the 1950s, running on a Wisconsin engine/ tractor unit transferred from the old Danseys Pass tow. This engine is now sitting below the top towshed, as with most things at Awakino, the history is all around you. The main tow direction was altered in the 1960s and then extended several times to its present location. It runs off a Ford 3000 tractor, installed within a railway container. The main tow is 800 metres long, rising from about 1450 metres to 1735 metres. The top tow was installed in the late 1980s and currently runs on a petrol powered engine, the only such tow in New Zealand to still operate with petrol. The ridge tow is about 700 metres long, and rises from 1735 metres to about 1880 metres, close to the summit of the range at this point. This may be the steepest tow in the world. The learners tow is small, currently petrol powered, and sits adjacent to the top huts. There are the remains of various other tows on the field, most notably the access tow below the top buildings that operated in the early 1990s before snow became unreliable and people obtained 4WDs, and an old learners tow just below the top buildings. A tow was installed in the 1960s in the remote Hut Creek catchment behind the St Marys range. The old Case tractor drive unit for this sits forlornly in the snow just off the main ridge, but has not operated for over 50 years. =Treble Cone (Wanaka)= Historically: * Main double (see below), installed in the early 1980s. * Saddle T Bar (removed in 2006?). Replaced by the Saddle Quad. * Saddle Double - diesel fixed grip, moved to Saddle Basin in 1995? after it was replaced on its old alignment by the current six-seater. Replaced in 2006? by the Summit Quad. * Main T Bar (next to the six seater), removed in 1990s? Currently: * Six seater express (Doppelmayr) - detachable six seater, installed in 1996? * Saddle Quad - fixed grip quad (Doppelmayr) from the old base site of the saddle basin double to near Tim's table, above the top of the old T-bar. * Learners lifts =Cardrona (Wanaka)= Currently: * Learners Carpet 17 vertical metres * McDougall's Chondola 180 vertical metres * Captain's Express 265 vertical metres * Whitestar Express 320 vertical metres * Valley View 300 vertical metres. This is being converted to a \\"chondola\\" arrangement, with several gondola cars being installed onto the main wire rope. Past: 1x double chair - the La Franchi double, more or less on the alignment of the current Whitestar Express. Note: Calculated from Stats - official verification still needed =Snow Farm / Snow Park (Wanaka)= =Coronet Peak (Queenstown)= Historically: * A \\"double\\" rope tow (one which has two ropes working simultaneously but in opposite directions so that passengers can ride up on either side). Snowboarders would have loved this, if those things were invented back then. Installed in 1947 and designed by William (Bill) Hamilton, the inventor of the jet boat, who also perfected the nutcracker device that is still used today. * The Happy Valley Poma - the original learners lift, running diagonally right from the base buildings towards the Lunch Rocks. From memory (1992) it had three large spans and two jumping off points. Removed in 1994 * The Shirtfront Double chair - installed in 1952 as one of the first chairlifts installed in New Zealand. This was the main lift of the field until 1994, whereupon it was then moved to replace the Happy Valley poma on a new alignment as the Meadows double chair. It lasted here until the start of 2010. Rumour has it that they didn't need to slow it down for suitability as a learners lift. Converted to electric at some stage in the 1960s. It ran from the base buildings to the platform below the 'coronet' of the peak. A mid- station was sited just right of the bend in the M1 run, and was in use until it was removed. The mid-station was used for loading and unloading at the same time, with staggered queues and chairs left empty at the bottom. The chairs on the lift could also carry sleds for the \\"cresta run\\" sled track at Coronet peak. This operated until the early 1990s. * The Greengates triple. My favourite old lift. Installed in the 1970s on the western part of the field. This had real character, with the entire drive unit (first diesel, then electric) sitting on rollers within a frame mounted to a dynamic cable counterweight, presumably to take up the slack from the several large spans that the lift went through higher up. It had a mid-station a short distance up the line. Removed in 2007 and replaced with a six-seater Greengates express. The mid-station was rarely used, except when snow conditions on the lower runs (Lower Wall Street) prevented access back to the base. * The Blue Gums poma, a small learners poma below the Rocky Gully T Bar. Removed in the 1990s. Currently: * The Coronet Express detachable quad - installed in 1994 * Greengates Express six seater - installed in 2005, on an alignment slightly to the west of the old Greengates triple. * Meadows Quad - installed in 2010, replacing the old double. * Rocky Gully T-bar, in Rocky gully on the right of the field, installed in 1981 =The Remarkables (Queenstown)= All original lifts installed in the early 1980s when the field was developed. Historically: * The Alta Double (now replaced by a quad), sometime in the late 1990s Currently: * The Alta Quad - fixed grip, installed in the late 1990s. * Curvey Basin Six - six-seat detachable express (Leitner-Poma) installed in 2014 * Sugar Bowl II - Detachable 6 seater express (Doppelmayr), installed in 2020, runs on a new alignment from the base area to a top station slightly to the north-west and above the original lifts top station. Replaced the Sugar Bowl Quad (fixed grip, installed in the 1980s, used to have a mid-station) * Shadow Basin Quad, still with a mid-station (one of only two left in New Zealand). * Learners lifts =Invincible (Glenorchy)= 1 rope tow =Other South Island lifts= * Danseys Pass The original ski tow of the Waitaki Ski Club, installed shortly after World War II, and then moved to Awakino on the northern part of the St Marys Range. This tow motor now sits below the ridge tow at Awakino * Lees Valley Remnants of old tows can be found on both Chest Peak and Mt Oxford in the Lees Valley area of North Canterbury. * Kelly Range This tow used to operate on the eastern slopes of the range up to Kelly Saddle until the late 1940s. Operated by the West Coast Alpine Club. * Kakanui Mountains, above the Pigroot Operated until the early 1990s, installed in the late 1970s, possibly using the drive gear from the old tow at Leaning Lodge in the Rock and Pillars. * Rock and Pillars A small tow on the summit plateau near big hut (running until the 1950s by the Otago Ski Club) A larger tow at Leaning Lodge, installed in the 1960s and operating until an avalanche in the early 1970s. Parts of this rope tow, including two towers, are still in place below Leaning Lodge Hut.http://www.middlemarch.co.nz/big_hut/files/history.html * Garston Installed by the Southland Ski Club and operated until the early 1950s when the club shifted to Coronet Peak. *Mt Luxmore Installed by the Te Anau Community on the slopes of Mt Luxmore in Fiordland National Park in the 1960s. The towers are still there, but little is known about the tow.

It was built in 1783 by engineer I. Borisov, at the same time that the granite embankments of the canal were being constructed.  History  The name of the bridge is that of Kalinkina village, which was situated at the bridge's location in the 18th century. The design of the bridge is similar to that of the Pikalov Bridge and other bridges downstream along the Griboyedov Canal; being a three-span wooden bridge with granite piers, with an adjustable middle span. In 1808, the bridge was rebuilt with the width of the deck being increased from to . The stone pillars were repaired by the dismantling of masonry within two rows of the granite cladding, and the subsequent driving additional piles to better support the bridge. In the second half of the 19th century the movable middle span of the bridge was replaced. In 1908, in connection with the laying rails for tram routes, the bridge was widened and metal support beams were installed instead of the original wooden beams, but the historical appearance of the bridge was preserved. In 1952 and 1970, lanterns and granite obelisks were restored on the bridge piers as part of a project undertaken by architect A. L. Rotach. In 2007 the results of a major overhaul of the bridge were presented by engineer Vyacheslav Shlyakhin: * Light fixtures with lamps and obelisks on the channel supports were restored as replicas of those from the bridge's 1808 appearance. * The foundation of the bridge was strengthened. * Part of the bridge's lattice, earlier destroyed as a result of a transport accident, was restored. * The base of the tram rails running across the bridge was replaced with a reinforced concrete slab, with accompanying restoration of the roadway.  In Literature  The bridge is mentioned in Nikolai Gogol's short story, ¬´ The Overcoat. ¬ª The main character, Akaky Akakievich ‚Äîor a certain clerk‚Äî is rumored to appear as a ghost near the bridge, searching for his stolen overcoat.

This perennial herb forms a mound of branching stems, giving it a bushy look. The white stems are up to 30 to 50 centimeters tall. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, the lowest ones measuring up to 4 centimeters in length. The leaves are covered in barbed hairs that will stick to cloth. The flowers are borne at the ends of the stems. Each has 10 bright yellow glossy petals just over a centimeter long. The flowers bloom in July and August and open in the late afternoon. The fruit is a capsule up to a centimeter long. This plant grows on rock outcrops in substrates of pumice and ash. The habitat is pinyon-juniper woodland and Ponderosa pine forest. Other plants in the habitat include Apache plume, rubber rabbitbrush, brownplume wirelettuce, sticky gilia, and gypsum phacelia. Much of this plant's range is within Bandelier National Monument. There are few threats to its survival because it occurs in remote territory. Soil disturbance is not necessarily detrimental to the plant; it often grows along roads cut through the pumice.

Diamond Activ Solar exhibited a solar aircraft wing at the Paris Air Show 2011. Ownership Activ Solar was controlled by Ukraine's former first deputy prime minister Andriy Klyuyev and his brother Serhiy Klyuyev. CEO of Activ Solar, Kaveh Ertefai, was Serhiy Klyuyev's son-in-law. Bogdan Klyuyev, son of Andriy Klyuyev, was a business developer manager of Activ Solar LLC (Ukraine). According to Kyiv Post, Klyuyev's companies were registered at the same building where Activ Solar had its representative office in Ukraine. According to the report by Ukrayinska Pravda, Solar Activ was founded by Slav Beteiligung GmbH, owned by Slav AG, investment firm of by brothers Kluyevs. In late 2008, the ownership was transferred to Kaveh Ertefay. In July 2009, ownership was transferred to P&A; Corporate Trust. According to a British register, P&A; Corporate Trust owns British firm Blythe (Europe) Ltd, which owns 35% of company Tantalit which was the nominal owner of the residence of President Viktor Yanukovych at Mezhyhirya. According to the company register, in 2011 Activ Solar was 100% owned by Liechtenstein-registered P&A; Corporate Trust. According to the company, shareholders of the company were European institutional and private investors. According to Johann Harter (COO), all shareholders were Austrian institutional and private investors and there were no Ukrainian private investors or companies associated with the Ukraine among the shareholders. According to Kave Ertefay, 50% of the shares belonged to investors from Austria and the rest of the EU. Interfax-Ukraina agency reported that controlling stake in Activ Solar belonged to Christian Dries, the owner of Diamond Aircraft Industries, and the rest was owned by the management of the company. At the beginning of 2016, the sole owner of the company was Viennese lawyer Stefan Benesch. Insolvency On 1 April 2014, Activ Solar stopped operations of its solar power plants in Crimea due to unclear legal situation after annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. While Ukrainian authorities stopped paying feed-in tariff for Crimean solar plants, Crimean and Russian authorities also refused to pay it. In spring 2015, Crimean solar plants were seized by Russian banks to cover outstanding loans of Activ Solar. In November 2015, the China National Building Material Company (CNBM) received a clearance to buy the Activ Solar's subsidiary operating ten solar parks located in Mykolaiv and Odessa oblasts. According to the company, it had controlled these power stations since mid-2014 as collateral of its ‚Ç¨160 million loan to Activ Solar. CNBM s also interested to buy the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant. Investigation had been launched concerning the Ukrainian state credit grant to the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant in 2010. In October 2015, the Ukrainian court ordered repayment of the ‚Ç¨57 million grant. As a result, Activ Solar filed for reorganisation in the Commercial Court of Vienna on 10 February 2016. The company explained this move with challenging market conditions in Ukraine due to the economic and political crisis in the region, which affected production in the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant. For that time, Activ Solar's debt had amounted ‚Ç¨503.4 million while its assets accounted ‚Ç¨18.69 million. The company proposed a two- years restructuring plan with 20% of its debts repayment. Attorney Ute Toifl was appointed as an insolvency administrator. Also the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant went into bankrupt.

Carrera is a transgender woman and a transgender rights activist. Life and career Carrera was born in Elmwood Park, New Jersey.New Jersey's own Carmen Carrera brings the heat to Season 3 of \\"RuPaul's Drag Race\\"!  Out in Jersey . Retrieved November 2, 2011. In 2011, she appeared in the third season of the reality television competition show, RuPaul's Drag Race. Carrera is the second contestant in the history of the show (after season three castmate, Shangela) to rejoin the cast after being eliminated, and along with Raja, Manila Luzon, and Delta Work, was part of the clique known as the \\"Heathers\\", which took its name from the 1988 film, Heathers. In episode 10, \\"RuPaul-a-Palooza\\", Carrera was eliminated for her performance while lip-synching to a reggae-inspired cover of RuPaul's song \\"Superstar\\". Judges Michelle Visage, Santino Rice, and Billy Brasfield voted to re-invite Carrera to the competition in episode 12, \\"Jocks in Frocks\\". Subsequently, Carrera was eliminated in that episode after styling a muscular male athlete in her own signature \\"nude\\"-style of drag. The November 2011 issue of W featured a series of fictional products in realistically styled advertisements as part of an issue-wide art project. Carrera was featured in the series as the face for the fictional fragrance La Femme. In 2011, Carrera, along with third season Drag Race contestants Manila Luzon and Shangela Laquifa Wadley, appeared in a television commercial for the travel-related website Orbitz. Carrera has also been active in AIDS awareness and activism. After being featured in a Gilead Sciences ad titled \\"Red Ribbon Runway\\" with fellow Drag Race co-stars Manila Luzon, Delta Work, Shangela Laquifa Wadley, and Alexis Mateo, the dress she wore was auctioned by Logo in commemoration of World AIDS Day. Proceeds from the auction were donated to the National Association of People with AIDS. Carrera appeared as a \\"drag professor\\" in two episodes of the second season of RuPaul's Drag U. In the episode \\"80s Ladies\\", she gave singer Stacey Q a confidence-boosting makeover. Carrera appeared in recording artist Lovari's music video for \\"Take My Pain Away\\". In an episode of the ABC news program Primetime: What Would You Do? that aired on May 4, 2012, Carrera portrayed the role of a transgender server working in a New Jersey diner. An actor playing a customer berates Carrera's character regarding his past experience of being served by her when she had presented as male, prompting other customers to come to Carrera's defense. This program also marked the first occasion in which Carrera publicly revealed herself to be transgender. On June 11, 2012, Carrera appeared in an episode of the TLC series Cake Boss, \\"Bar Mitzvah, Beads & Oh Baby!\\", in which she unknowingly participated in a prank involving \\"Cousin Anthony\\" Bellifemine, the cousin of \\"Cake Boss\\" Buddy Valastro, who was set up with a date with Carrera. The punchline of the joke had Valastro tell Bellifemine that \\"...that's a man, baby!\\" Carrera, however, originally agreed to appear on the program to promote equality for the transgender community, not aware that she would be involved in a joke. Following the airing of the program, Carrera rebuked the situation on Facebook: Carrera with David LaChapelle at Life Ball 2014 Valastro subsequently apologized for the incident, saying that > I owe an apology to the entire LGBT community. It was absolutely not my > intention to upset or offend her, or anyone within the community, and I was > wrong to use the words I did. I am a supporter of gay rights and equality, > and while I regret this situation and my choice of words, I am thankful to > have received this feedback and the opportunity to learn from this mistake. > I hope that Carmen accepts my sincere regrets. The following day, on June 12, 2012, TLC announced that \\"Bar Mitzvah, Beads & Oh Baby!\\" has been pulled from rotation indefinitely; the network has plans to re-edit the episode for future broadcast. A petition started requesting that Carrera serve as a model during the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but despite media coverage and approximately 45,000 signatures the petition was unsuccessful. In March 2014, Carrera openly criticized RuPaul for use of the pejorative \\"she-male\\" on a RuPaul's Drag Race episode. She continued to be critical of RuPaul when the issue arose again in 2015, after Logo pulled the \\"Female or SheMale\\" game from DragRace, which prompted RuPaul to defend the use of the word \\"tranny\\". Carrera's continued protests led to accusations by others that she was biting the hand that fed her. Carrera responded that, while she appreciates the opportunity to compete on DragRace, she ultimately earned her status through her efforts and those of her agent, friends, fans, and family, and that she was not beholden to support RuPaul's use of transphobic language. Carrera was featured in the work of photographer David LaChapelle. She posed for a poster for Life Ball, depicted with both male and female genitalia to represent the blurring of gender identity. In 2014, Carrera was included as part of the Advocate's annual \\"40 under 40\\" list and made a cameo appearance on Jane the Virgin's premier episode. Also in 2014, Carrera was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of C‚òÜNDY magazine along with thirteen other transgender women: Janet Mock, Laverne Cox, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, P√™che Di, Carmen Xtravaganza and Yasmine Petty. Personal life Carrera was in a domestic partnership with Adrian Torres since 2009, but she announced in 2013 that they had separated. In 2015, the two were together, receiving relationship counseling while being filmed for the Couples Therapy television show. They wed on June 10, 2015, during filming for the show, which aired as the season finale on December 9, 2015. Carrera had identified as a gay man, and continued to present as such during filming of the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race, but began her gender transition when she concluded filming. She is of Puerto Rican-Peruvian ancestry.

Miller was said to be sewing a dress alone in the house and did not notice an intruder sneaking into the house. The perpetrator fought with the young woman, hogtied her and stabbed her in the chest. =Historical context= The original conviction of Hillery occurred in the early 1960s in California. At that time, America was in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. Blacks were excluded from the indicting grand jury, which led Hillery to claim that he was denied equal protection rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He petitioned for a retrial on that basis. =Legal challenge= In 1978, Hillery filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, which granted the writ, citing grand jury discrimination. The Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling. In 1986, his original conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Hillery was retried later that year, and was again convicted in the second trial. The forensic evidence which helped convict Hillery in the second trial was examined in the 2003 episode of Forensic Files titled \\"Paintball\\". Opinion of the Court =Majority= Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court, stating: Marshall then went on to say: =Concurrence= Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment. O'Connor stated: = Dissent= Justice Powell, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, dissented, arguing that \\"the Court misapplies stare decisis because it relies only on decisions concerning grand jury discrimination. There is other precedent, including important cases of more recent vintage than those cited by the Court, that should control this case. Those cases hold, or clearly imply, that a conviction should not be reversed for constitutional error where the error did not affect the outcome of the prosecution\\". Powell continues his dissent by mentioning that since Chapman v. California, \\"the Court has consistently made clear that it is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations.\\" After citing cases where the Supreme Court applied harmless-error analysis or an analogous prejudice requirement on this basis, Powell stated: Finally, Powell believes that the Appellate Court's decision, overturning Hillery's conviction should be reversed because the \\"respondent's grand jury discrimination claim casts no doubt on the adequacy of the procedures used to convict him or on the sufficiency of the evidence of his guilt\\".

The industry began in 1881 and thrived throughout the Industrial Revolution. The Lehigh Valley Silk Mills also refers to a specific company that owned the Lipps & Sutton Silk Mill and Warren Mill. The first silk mill in the Lehigh Valley opened in 1881 followed by many others. By 1900, there were twenty-three silk establishments in the Lehigh Valley, making Pennsylvania the second largest producer of silk in the world. The silk industry in Pennsylvania peaked in the late 1920s due to cheap labor, mainly from immigrant workers' children and wives. However, after the Great Depression, increasing labor unrest and competition from other textile industries began to affect the silk industry locally and nationally. By 1953, Allentown had become the number one silk city in the world, but even then, the number of looms had decreased. At the time, only six mills continued to work with silk exclusively. Other mills either shut down due to bankruptcy or shifted to the production synthetic fibers.  History  As the United States entered the Gilded Age, the demand for luxurious silk clothing spiked. During the late 1800s silk was becoming popular with the growing middle class who wished to emulate the wealthy tycoons of the day. The growing industrialized American silk industry answered this demand. After the Civil War, an American silk industry became established in Paterson, New Jersey. There, the silk manufacturers relied on skilled workers, who demand good wages and working conditions. By 1880, new machines were changing the way silk was spun, knitted, and woven, as a result silk mill owners were looking to build new mills in areas with a large supply of low-cost labor. As it turned out, the collapse of the national railroad building boom in 1873 devastated the iron industry. In the wake of closing iron mills, Lehigh Valley business leaders saw an opportunity in the business of silk producers. They advertised the region's good railroads, secure supply of coal power, and cheap non-unionized labor. Interest in silk in the Lehigh Valley can be seen as early as 1762, but the industry did not become established on a large scale until The Adelaide Silk Mill, the first silk mill in the Lehigh Valley, opened in November 1881. This was soon followed by the R.H. Simon Silk Mill in 1883. By 1900, there were twenty-three silk establishments in the Lehigh Valley, making it and Pennsylvania the world's second-largest producer of silk, second only to New Jersey. As many as 224 mills produced silk in the Lehigh Valley between 1881 and 1989. The silk industry peaked in the late 1920s. The industry was Allentown's largest employer during this time. In 1928, the peak production year, 106 mills operated simultaneously in the Lehigh Valley. The silk industry was drawn to the Lehigh Valley for its access to water, power and labor. The spinning machines in the mills required constant tending, and provided jobs that suited the women and children of that era. Because of this they had a tendency to be located near mines and other heavy industries that would attract men to work, who would bring their wives and children to possibly seek employment. In an attempt to address issues with youth unemployment, in 1883 Easton formed its first \\"industrial association\\". After establishing the association, the associates needed to attract business to Easton. They successfully developed a partnership with a New Jersey silk manufacturing company. Robert and Herman Simon expanded their enterprise from Union Hill, New Jersey west to Easton, Pennsylvania. It was at this time that the R&H; Simon Company constructed buildings along 13th Street, Easton. At the start, the company had a workforce of 250 people. The facility expanded in 1899 by increasing its workforce to 1,060. The mill eventually employed 1,200 workers and included 1,500 pieces of machinery. The R&H; Simon Silk Company was the largest producer of black silk ribbon in the world and at one point in time employed up to 2,000 workers at its Easton plant. The deaths of Robert Simon and Herman Simon in 1901 marshalled in a transformative period for the company. The Easton Industrial Corporation managed the company from roughly 1933 ‚Äì 1985, periodically loaning the property. In 1991, Pfizer Pigments Inc. transferred the property to James and Helen Garofalo and Helen Beth Garofalo- Vilcek who subsequently transferred the property to the City of Easton in 2006. One of the most important men of the American Silk industry, Desiderius George Dery, also made his home in the valley. By 1920 he was the largest single producer of silk in the world, and 8 of his 15 mills were located in the Lehigh Valley. The demise of the silk industry in the Lehigh Valley can be traced to the Great Depression, Southern competition and new synthetics. After that the Great Depression, increasing labor unrest affected the industry locally and nationally. After peaking in the 1920s, silk, like the rest of the luxury goods industry, suffered heavily in the Great Depression. The Lehigh Valley lost at least fifty-eight silk mills from 1929 to 1939. Many new mills were opening in the South due to the availability of cheaper labor. During World War II the silk supply, which predominantly came from Japan, was cut off. After the war, new synthetic fibers developed during the war, such as nylon, replaced silk in many garments. Some mills clung on shifting to Rayon or other materials. By 1953, Allentown which had become the number one silk city, had decreased the number of looms by 80 percent, with only six mills working exclusively with silk. The next few decades saw increasing international competition from low-wage countries. The Catoir Silk Co., established in 1918, was the last silk mill in Allentown and closed in 1989. The industry was killed off through the globalization of the 1960s through 1980s, that brought cheaper goods produced in other countries. Low wage labor, which had originally brought the silk industry to the Lehigh Valley, was what led to its departure from the region.  Child Labor and Female Employment  Throughout the late 1800s, child labor was common throughout Pennsylvania silk mills as many families depended on additional income for subsistence. Compared to adult males who's yearly wages hovered around $485.11 and adult females who's remained at $345.44, minors of either sex only earned roughly $143.64 yearly. This large wage gap made child labor attractive to mill owners, and quickly drew manufacturers to the Lehigh Valley area. Between 1880 and 1925, the value of silk products manufactured in Pennsylvania increased tenfold. At this time, working children were the cheapest form of labor used to maximize profits. In 1876, roughly 30 silk manufacturers opened plants in Pennsylvania largely due to the availability of child labor and the lack of concern for children in the wage labor force. By 1907, children comprised roughly 30% of the labor force throughout the Pennsylvania silk mills, many under the legal working age of 12. Although child labor persisted throughout the early 1900s, a progressive reform to keep children in school and out of the silk mills was quietly brewing. Throughout the Progressive Era, journalists, settlement house workers and a philanthropic organization called the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) studied, documented, and publicized the dangers of the work place for growing children. The committee pushed for legislation limiting hours of work and types of employment for young people and helped set a minimum legal working age. Between 1900 and 1920, the changes the reformers pushed for were slowly implemented but suffered many setbacks. Lack of enforcement by state factory inspectors made it difficult to ensure that silk mill manufacturers were abiding by the terms of the progressive reform and many laboring families still depended on their children's wages. Despite this, children's wages began to grow and soon after, children between the ages of 12 and 15 were slowly phased out of the silk mill labor force altogether. This progressive reform in setting a minimum legal working age lead to the shift from children in the workforce to female employment. In 1925, around the Lehigh Valley area, a study of immigrant women conducted by the United States Department of Labor and the United States Women's Bureau illustrated that there was a large shift in the number of wives and mothers that occupied positions in the silk mill industry. In the early 1900s the silk mills employed a large population of girls under the age of 18 who worked to financially support their families during this time of economic distress. Areas within the Lehigh Valley such as, Allentown and South Bethlehem, had two to threefold more girls under the age of 18 working compared to women over the age of 25. As the 1900s began to take shape, starting around the 1920s, the age of women changed drastically as new progressive laws pushed young females out of the industry. New legislation during this time lead to an increase in employment of married women in labor industries. The shift from child labor to the labor of adult, married women was one that all progressive pioneers strived for, yet may have seemed pessimistic during the late 19th century to early 20th century. As families began to require a higher level of financial assistance, this led to a need for at least more than one source of income. Wages at silk mills were often much lower than that needed to be able to efficiently support a family; although, the wage was helpful as it was better than no income at all. Even with respect to the new legislation passed, parents still kept their kids out of the workforce well over the legal age of fourteen. By the late 1920s it was widely acceptable to see women work outside of the house in order to provide additional income for families. In addition, young children were able to maintain more years of schooling, ultimately increasing their human capital for future endeavors.  Silk Mill redevelopment  = R&H; Simon Silk Mill = The R&H; Simon Silk Mill was originally built in 1883 along Bushkill Creek on North 13th street in Easton, Pennsylvania. The mill was bought in 2006 by the Easton Redevelopment Authority, and developers Mark Mulligan and William Vogt of VM Development Group joined the $50 million project. Construction of the project began in 2010. In addition, another building at 544 N. 13th Street that is part of the Simon Silk Mill, will be developed into four additional apartments by B2 Ventures of Bethlehem, which is owned by developer Borko Milosev. The plans for the Mill include 150 residential units and at least 150,000 square feet of commercial space. The plan entails two thirds of the apartments to be one- bedroom spaces and the remaining third to be two-bedroom spaces. The new buildings will contain some of the original brick walls, refurbished wood floors and restored windows. In addition, a piece of industrial machinery will be removed from inside one of the mills and left in a prominent outdoor location. The refurbished area and apartments are intended to be ready for tenants to move in by spring of 2016. The project's success is crucial to the city's economic future and is intended to be a space for resident artists to form a community. Throughout the project's redevelopment stages, environmental remediation was necessary. In the basement of one of the main mill buildings, workers found contaminated soil. Due to the building's industrial history as a silk mill, soil and groundwater was contaminated with metals and organic compounds. Remediation of the area was approved by state environmental officials and was successfully completed. The R&H; Simon Silk Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2014. = Dery Silk Mill = Located in Catasauqua, PA, the Dery Silk Mill was built in 1897 by Desiderius George Deri. The building is an L-Shaped building with three stories on Race and Front streets and once employed 400 workers. The renovations of the mill began in 1984 with the purpose of improving the walls by removing poison ivy, steam-cleaning and repointing. In addition, the windows were removed, improved, and reinstalled. The now rental complex has 35 units with restored maple flooring and spaces divided by dry wall and duplexes created with beams and lofts. = Adelaide Silk Mill = Opening in November 1881, the Adelaide Silk Mill was built by businessmen from Allentown for the Phoenix Manufacturing Co., a silk maker from Paterson, NJ looking to relocate. The mill is a U-shaped building at 333 W. Court St. off of the Jordan Creek in the Lehigh Canal. The mill was redeveloped after operations ended in 1964. Currently, the mill is vacant but it has been used as an antique market, a fitness facility, and many other businesses. There were plans in 2013 to convert the two buildings into 150 apartments and commercial space under the declaration of a Keystone Opportunity Zone, which would exempt the property from real estate taxes for the first ten years. The Allentown School Board and Lehigh County Commissioners voted against this. = Bethlehem Silk Mill = The Bethlehem Silk Mill is located on West Goepp Street in Bethlehem, Pa. In 2006, the complex was in the process of being developed by Ashley Development and Philadelphia-based Campus Apartments Inc. into student apartments for Moravian College. The $15 million redevelopment project was four months from completion when a fire broke out. The fire marked the end of Moravian College's investment in the redevelopment project. The five building complex was then re-bought in 2008 by Abraham Atiyeh. Abraham Atiyeh continued with the plans to turn the complex into apartments. As of October 2012, Atiyeh had sold a portion of the property to his former business partner, Ramzi Haddad. This portion of the property was pre-approved for the building of 90 more apartments. As of 2012, Atiyeh also had an ongoing discussion to sell the existing 61 apartments to a New York Real Estate Company. The Bethlehem Silk Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in February 2005. = Lipps & Sutton Silk Mills = The Lipps & Sutton Silk Mill is located in Fountain Hill, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The mill was completely redeveloped in the early 1990s into multiple use spaces some of which include: apartments, municipal offices and police headquarters. The buildings were renovated using federal historic preservation tax credit. In addition, in 1993, the mill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because it was one of the first mills in the area during the Industrial Revolution. Currently, it is the location of the administrative offices for the Fountain Hill Borough.  Gallery  File:Lipps & Sutton Silk Mill 04.JPGLipps & Sutton Silk Mill, central part.

He was the guru of 'Akhil Bhartiye Santmat Satsang'.

He gave one and easiest method to get 'Moksha'. They are 'Satsang' and 'Dhyan'(Meditation). Mehi was a direct disciple of Baba Devi Sahab of Muradabad, Uttar Pradesh.  Early life  Maharshi Mehi was born on in a small village of Bihar, Majhua (Khoskhsi Shyam), India. He studied from early age alone and then with Baba Devi Sahab, in 1909. As directed by his teacher, Mehi spent many years in intense meditation in an ashram located in Manihari of the Katihar district.http://www.sadgurumehi.com/index.html  Life  Maharshi Mehi was born in at his maternal grandparents‚Äô home in Khokhsi Shyam Village, in Saharsa, Bihar, India. His grandmother's home was in Shikli garh Dharahara, Banmankhi, in the Purnia district. There was a cave in which he used to go there for meditation. His father was called Babujan Lal Das. The family astrologer named him as Ramanugrah Lal Das based on his astrological charts, a name that is also found in Mehi's school records. His adopted name Mehi means lean and thin and also sharp or subtle. About two decades later when Ramanugrah La Das came into contact with his guru, Baba Devi Sahab, the latter, impressed by his exceptionally sharp intellect, also started calling him \\"Mehi\\".https://archive.org/stream/PhilosophyOfLiberationAManualOfSantMatMysticism/Philosophy_Of_Liberation#page/n7/mode/1up Mehi's, Janakwati Devi, died when he was four years old. His elder sister was very kind to him and she and his father took a very good care of him. He was admitted to the village school, when he turned eight. At this school learning was imparted in the local Kaithi script. At home he saw his father reciting regularly from the great epic the Ramcharitmanas composed by the poet sant Goswami Tulsidas ji. His father often turned very emotional while reciting and at times burst into tears. This made Mehi curious to know the contents of the epic. As the epic was printed in the Devanagari script he could not read it at first. However, he labored to correlate the alphabets of Devanagri from those of Kaithi and soon he could learn Devanagri script as well. The Ram charit manas left a deep impact on his mind and several of its quartets and couplets became known to him by heart. He also learnt English, Urdu and Persian languages at the secondary school. In his childhood days Maharshi Mehi Paramhans was a worshipper of Lord Shiva, but his method of worshipping was unique: he would drive a nail into the ground, make it an offering of water and then sit in its front in meditation. As a teenager, he was a very good player of soccer. Impressed with his skills at dabbling the ball, his friends made him the team captain. However, very soon he began to lose interest in playing as well as formal studies even as he developed an intense fondness for study of religious scriptures like the Sukhsagar and the Mahabharat apart from the Ramcharitmanas. He would very often retire into solitude while his friends were busy playing and study these books. His disinterest for schooling and formal studies kept waxing progressively and reached its climax on 3 July 1904. Half yearly exams of Class X were on and it was the second paper ‚Äì English. The first question read: \\"Quote from memory the poem ‚ÄòBuilders‚Äô and explain it in your own English.\\" Answering the question, he quoted the first four lines, as reproduced below, and began to explain these. The lines of the poem were: > \\"For the structure that we raise, > time is with material's field, > our todays and yesterdays, > are the blocks with which we build.\\" - Maharshi > Mehihttp://www.sadgurumehi.com/book/guru_biography.html While explaining the central message of the above lines he got overwhelmed with such a strong surge of emotion of renunciation that he stood up and asked the invigilator, \\"May I go out, Sir?\\" Thinking that he wanted to go to toilet, the invigilator granted the permission but little did he know that this young lad was not merely going out of the examination hall briefly but had decided to bid adieu to the very household life for good. In fact, Mehi had made already three unsuccessful attempts to flee home, but this time his determination was rock solid and he was never ever to look back again.  Gurus  Baba Devi Sahab was the main spiritual Guru of Mehi. However, before he met Baba Devi Sahab, his intense yearning for true emancipation had led him to three other gurus (spiritual teacher). In accordance with his family tradition, Mehi was initiated by Mr Ram Jha, a Brahmin priest from Darbhanga district of the state of Bihar, in 1902. Mr Jha was a worshipper of Lord Shiva and Mother Goddess Kali and was very fond of hunting. He, in his later years, lost his eyesight and just had a feeling that this (loss of vision) was the consequence of his previous acts of killing birds & animals. He, therefore, preached Mehi never to commit violence. Ramanand Swami, a sadhu of Dariyapanth (a sect named after Sant Dariya Sahab of Bihar), was Mehi's second guru. Ramanand Swami taught Mehi to practice 'Manas Jap' (internally chanting or repeatedly reciting a sacred mantra), 'Manas Dhyan' (trying to concentrate internally on the form of a sacred deity or Guru) and 'Bahya Drishti Sadahan' (stilling gaze at a target in the outside, not within ). However, through a study of saintly literature and relevant spiritual Scriptures Mehi had come to realise that the knowledge of Sound/Word Meditation (Surat Shabda Yoga) was a must for total liberation ‚Äì a domain Ramanand Swami was not conversant with. Curious questioning about the 'sara shabda'(Quintessential Unstruck Sound) by Mehi often irritated or even infuriated his guru Ramanand Swami ji which left Mehi dissatisfied and fully convinced that he would have to find another suitable guru. He, thus, remained restless and on the look out for a complete Guru. He would rush to several places wherever he heard of the possibility of seeing a person who could guide him in Sound Meditation. It was his incessant search, that was far and wide, that led Mehi to a disciple of Baba Devi Sahab named Mr Dhiraj Lal from Jotramrai, the very same village where Mehi had been staying in attendance upon Ramanand Swami. Mehi was deeply satisfied with the clarifications offered by Mr. Dhiraj Lal on a number of topics that had been puzzling Mehi for a long time. It was difficult to find free time during the day for he had to attend to various duties instructed by his erstwhile guru. So, after getting free from his duties towards Ramanand Swami Ji in the night he would approach Mr Dhiraj Lal and the two had absorbing discussions from midnight to about 3 AM and this went on for about three months (May ‚Äì July 1909) till Mehi became finally convinced that he had landed in the right spot and that Baba Devi Sahab was indeed the true Guru he had been looking for. However, since Baba Devi Sahab lived at Moradabad of U.P., Mr Dhiraj Lal advised Mehi to approach, in the meanwhile, and have initiation from Mr. Rajendra Nath Singh of Bhagalpur, a place that was relatively nearer. Mr Rajendra Nath, an initiate of Baba Devi Sahab, was an advocate by profession. He had some preliminary discussions with Mehi and saw in him a genuine seeker thirsting for freedom from the bondage of BMI (Body-Mind-Intellect-Ego Complex). He gladly gave initiation to Mehi, teaching him the art of 'drishti sadhan'(the Yoga of Inner Light ‚Äì a technique to still one's gaze in the inner sky in front of the centre of the two eyes, called variously as the Sushumna, Sukhamana, the Ajna Chakra, the Third Eye, the Tenth Door, the Shiva Netra etc.)aimed at transcending the Gross Sphere, the Realm of Darkness and, thus, moving into the Realm of Light, the Astral Plane. As the grateful Mehi tried to touch Mr. Rajendra Nath's feet in reverence, the latter forcibly stopped him and told, \\"Look, I am not your Guru. I have only explained you the method as authorised by Sadguru Baba Devi Sahab. Baba Devi Sahab, not I, is your Guru.\\" Mehi replied, \\"Yes, of course, he is my Guru and your Guru also, but since you have taught me this (drishti Sadahn), you are also like my Guru.\\" Thus, Mr Rajendra Nath Singh may be treated to be his third Guru. After having been initiated into Santmat and becoming fully satisfied, Mehi, as advised by his friends, returned to where his father (who became ecstatic to see his son back home) lived and waited to see Baba Devi Sahab. The momentous occasion finally came during the festival of Dashahara (celebrated generally in the month of October) when Baba Devi Sahab arrived at Bhagalpur. When Mr Dhiraj Lal informed Mehi of the programme of Baba Devi Sahab's visit to Bhagalpur, Mehi got excited like a child and rushed to see his Guru. It was on the auspicious day of Vijayadashami of 1909 that he got to have his first glimpse of his Guru ‚Äì a true Guru had got a true disciple and successor who was to take Santmat to the dizzier pinnacles of glory.

The series is executive-produced by J. J. Abrams, King, Bridget Carpenter and Bryan Burk, and produced by James Franco, who also has the main role. It premiered on Hulu on February 15, 2016, and was received positively by critics. Premise Jake Epping (James Franco), a recently divorced English teacher from Lisbon, Maine, is presented with the chance to travel back in time to 1960 by his long-time friend Al Templeton (Chris Cooper). He is persuaded into going in an attempt to prevent the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963; however, he becomes attached to the life he makes in the past, which could be the mission's undoing. He must find a way to secretly gather information about people and events leading up to the assassination while also creating and maintaining a new life to avoid suspicion.

However, in December 2012, Demme announced that he had withdrawn from the project, after disagreeing with King over what to include in the script. On April 26, 2013, it was reported that Warner Bros. Television and J. J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions were in negotiations for the rights to adapt the novel as a TV series or miniseries. On September 22, 2014, it was announced that a TV series based on the novel was picked up by Hulu. Carol Spier would be a production designer. The first trailer for the series was released on November 19, 2015. When asked about developing a sequel series, King stated, \\"I'd love to revisit Jake and Sadie, and also revisit the rabbit hole that dumps people into the past, but sometimes it's best not to go back for a second helping.\\" =Casting= James Franco was chosen to star as the character of Jake Epping. After reading the novel, Franco contacted King about the rights to adapt it to film only to be told that Abrams had already acquired them. Franco wrote an essay about the book for Vice, which was noticed by Abrams, and tweeted about his disappointment at not getting the film rights, which was noticed by Bridget Carpenter. Soon after, they offered him the lead role. He accepted the role under the condition that he would be able to direct part of the series. Sarah Gadon was cast for the role of Sadie Dunhill. She was interested in the role in part because it gave her the opportunity to work with Abrams. =Filming= Filming began on June 9, 2015, in Hespeler, Ontario. Filming during June 2015 also took place in Guelph, Ontario, as well as in Ayr, Ontario, at the Queen's Tavern, Hamilton, Ontario, and in Knowles Restaurant in Dunnville, Ontario during September 2015. In early October, the production moved to Dallas to film exterior locations at Dealey Plaza. During this time, the filming of various scenes during rush hour caused bumper to bumper traffic in the surrounding streets. Reception The show has garnered positive reviews from most critics. Based on 64 reviews, the show carries an 83% \\"certified fresh\\" rating, with an average percentage of 7.19/10, on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes where the consensus states: \\"Though the execution feels almost as dated as the period it represents, 11.22.63 gradually reveals a compelling, well-performed series of events.\\" On Metacritic, the show has a rating of 69 out of 100, based on 35 reviews, signifying \\"generally positive reviews\\". Jack Moore of GQ commented that \\"the show is moody and supernatural, while somehow also remaining grounded and full of heart\\", and lauded Franco as the show's standout, saying \\"what Franco gives is a vanity-free, indulgence-free performance that feels like the work of an Old Hollywood legend. It's earnest and full-hearted.\\" Alan Sepinwall also acclaimed Franco, stating \\"Franco's a revelation as Jake. He's an immensely talented actor and he's got the star quality you need to carry something this crazy, and this long.\\" Vicki Hyman of the Newark Star-Ledger praised the performances of Franco and Gadon, writing: \\"Their stirring romance carries with it the same whiff of doom as Epping's visits to Dealey Plaza, and gives what could be merely an interesting and handsomely-made take on the conspiracy thriller genre more texture and depth, resonating across the ages.\\" Hank Stuever of The Washington Post wrote that \\"King's work doesn't always happily travel through the portal connecting the page to the TV screen, but Hulu scores with an impressively stout-hearted, eight-part adaptation of 11/22/63.\\" On the other hand, Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly had a more mixed reaction and criticized Franco's performance, calling it \\"low-watt\\" and \\"disinterested\\". He wrote \\"11.22.63 reaches some thoughtful, moving conclusions, but oh, what could have been with a more engaged star. If only there were a time machine to fix that mistake.\\" Caroline Framke of Vox describes Franco's performance as inconsistent from scene to scene, but also that the show itself creates even more ambiguity with his character. She wrote \\"While he's technically old enough to portray 37-year-old Jake, Franco certainly doesn't read as anywhere close to 37, or the world-weariness Jake's supposed to exhibit\\" Slate author Willa Paskin believes though Franco is well known and well accomplished, he can't seem to get the \\"average guy\\" act right for this series. =Accolades= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - style=\\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Result ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Saturn Awards  Best Television Presentation  11.22.63   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" } Home media 11.22.63 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 9, 2016 in Region 1.

Personality and work  Jarc started his literary career in the late 1910s in Novo Mesto, which emerged at the time as an important literary center. As a young student, he joined the literary- artistic circle around the painter Bo≈æidar Jakac and poet Anton Podbev≈°ek. Together, they organized a cultural-artistic manifestation, known as the Novo Mesto Spring. During this period, Jarc became interested in anthroposophy and developed an interest in Buddhism. However, he later grew closer to Christianity, remaining a member of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 1920s, Jarc emerged as one of the most prominent expressionist poets in Slovenia. Recurrent themes in his poetry were the search of an exit from a sinking civilization. To the crisis of European civilization and the mechanization of man, he juxtaposed to an ecstatic and lyrical personal reflection. In the 1930s, he grew closer to Social Realism. One of his most important works is the autobiographical novel Novo mesto (1932), in which he described the intellectual and artistic turmoil in the small Lower Carniolan town in the first years after World War I.

Facts  G owed money to M, the respondent. The debt was secured by a mortgage passed on property belonging to B in favour of M. The mortgage bond was incorrectly worded to indicate that the debt was owed by SG (who happened to be the sole shareholder of G). When B became insolvent, T was appointed liquidator. M sought a preferential right in terms of the mortgage bond, but this claim was rejected by T on the grounds that, due to the factual inaccuracy, the mortgage had not come into existence.  Judgment  The court held, firstly, that a mortgage bond may be used both as an instrument of hypothecation and also as a record of debt, and secondly that it is matter of custom in drafting mortgage bonds to incorporate an admission of liability by the mortgagor to facilitate a quick and easy remedy.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 2, 2011. In the episode, Cartman feels persecuted after he is blamed for causing his school to attain a low score on a national fitness test. As he confides in his sapient stuffed animals, they end up becoming targeted for mutilation.\\"'South Park' Mocks 'Occupy Wall Street,' Michael Moore\\" . Fox Nation. November 2, 2011 The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker, and is a parody of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the late-2000s recession. Plot The assembled student body of South Park Elementary is informed that they have scored the lowest in the entire country on the Presidential Fitness Test due to Eric Cartman's extremely poor health, which single-handedly ruined what would have been the school's otherwise acceptable average; as punishment, the students are forced to alternate physical education in place of recess for four weeks. When they rebuke Cartman for this, he accuses them of being \\"the 99%\\" that is \\"ganging up\\" on him, the 1%, but when Craig Tucker dismissively tells him to go home and cry to his stuffed animals as usual, Cartman does just that. As he commiserates with his five stuffed animals, he carries on an imaginary conversation with them. When the toys \\"tell\\" him that the Fitness Test is Barack Obama's fault, Cartman concludes that he is being blamed because it is politically incorrect to blame a black president, even accusing the student-filled cafeteria of being a \\"99% rally\\" being held against him. This inspires Butters Stotch and Jimmy Valmer to form a 99% club to protest their being punished for Cartman's poor health. An angry group of fifth graders agrees, saying that it is time to make Cartman suffer. When the head of the Colorado Division of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition refuses to drop Cartman's test scores from the school's average, Butters and Jimmy stage a two-man protest outside his office that despite its size, attracts the attention of the police, who create a two square mile perimeter around them, and the news media, who mistakenly report that they are occupying the Red Robin two doors down from the Council office. Meanwhile, Cartman discovers his beloved stuffed animals being mutilated and destroyed one by one, beginning with his long-beloved Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree with his stuffing ripped out, and the word \\"VENGEANCE\\" written beneath him. Cartman regards his animals' destruction as their \\"murders\\", and even holds a funeral service for Clyde Frog. When Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick ask the fifth-graders whether they are behind the mutilations, they do not give a straightforward answer, but state that Cartman has had a comeuppance coming his way for a long time, and that because Stan and the other fourth- graders have failed to rein in Cartman's problematic behavior, the fifth- graders have something big planned to remedy the problem, in which they warn Stan and his friends not to interfere. When Peter Panda, another of Cartman's toys, is destroyed by a fire set in Cartman's bedroom one night, he seeks refuge with his three surviving stuffed animals at Token Black's house, because, according to Cartman, black people are not subject to criticism or harassment. Meanwhile, the fifth-graders stage an \\"83%\\" protest right next to Butters and Jimmy's 99% protest, proclaiming that as the 83%, they are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class. This begins an argument between the two groups that degenerates into a physical altercation that media characterize as \\"class warfare\\". Despite being at Token's mansion, Cartman discovers Muscle Man Marc melted in a boiling pot of water and Rumper Tumpskin chained to a wall with explosives, which Cartman triggers with a tripwire. He finds the remaining toy, a doll named Polly Prissypants, sitting in an armchair with a revolver, claiming responsibility for all the toy \\"murders\\". Polly \\"explains\\" that she did this because his friends were right when they said that he needed to grow up. Unbeknownst to him, Cartman's stunned friends watch the bizarre scene unfold from a balcony, as do Cartman's mother and Token's parents from outside a window. Cartman is incredulous that Polly murdered her friends, but Polly explains they were holding her and Cartman back, and that now, with the latter deaths occurring at Token's house, the blame will fall on him, while she and Cartman can grow up together. When Cartman points out that black people cannot be blamed for anything any more, Polly realizes her catastrophic error, and convinces Cartman to shoot her to death in order to escape blame himself, which Cartman tearfully does. Shocked at what they have just witnessed, Stan asks \\"what the hell?\\" Kyle, knowing how psychologically disturbed Cartman is, explains that \\"we told him to grow up so he got rid of his stuffed animals\\". The protests eventually fall apart, as the 99% and 83% are replaced by various smaller percentages, according to a reporter, who then rushes away when he is informed that protestors are now \\"occupying\\" a Macaroni Grill. Production According to the DVD commentary, the episode was based on cut footage from the season 14 episode \\"201\\" in which Cartman holds a tea party with his stuffed animals, and discusses the identity of his father with his mother. The episode included Marc Jacobs as one of Cartman's dolls because Jacobs has a real life tattoo of Cartman's Clyde Frog and Rumpertumskin dolls. Jacobs commemorated the reference by getting a Marc Jacobs doll tattoo on his arm.Marcus, Bennett (November 8, 2011). \\"Marc Jacobs Will Commemorate His South Park Role With Another Tattoo\\". The Cut. Retrieved October 2, 2018. Reception Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club graded the episode an \\"A‚àí\\", stating: \\"What worked in this episode didn't really have much to do with what was funny about it. While there were a few laughs to be had, humor wasn't really the focus. The focus instead lay on the twisted mind of Eric Cartman actually going through a potentially life-changing part of his existence.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a \\"Great\\" rating of 8 out of 10, noting the \\"clever bait-and-switch\\" on the part of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who indicated in their pre-air press that the episode would parody the Occupy Wall Street movement, only to focus more on Cartman's psychological growth. Though Isler felt it followed past formula for Cartman, he thought it enhanced the episode's theme, lent itself to memorable humor, and found Cartman's maturation, much like the plot of \\"You're Getting Old\\", to be surprising and interesting, if not exceptionally funny.Isler, Ramsey. \\"South Park: \\"1%\\" Review\\". IGN. November 3, 2011 Katia McGlynn of The Huffington Post, who found the episode's themes funny, praised Parker and Stone for their ability to make a topical episode in only six days, and to use the fourth grade class as a microcosm to parody current events.McGlynn, Katia. \\"'South Park' Mocks Occupy Wall Street, Michael Moore & The Media (VIDEO)\\". The Huffington Post. November 3, 2011 Asawin Suebsaeng of Mother Jones stated that despite Parker and Stone's libertarian leanings and their tendency to skewer orthodoxies in general and the political left and right in particular, the episode's \\"blatant\\" analogs did not merely target the Occupy Wall Street movement, but what Suebsaeng calls \\"the whiners, paranoid excuse-makers, and irrational Obama-blamers\\", as well as overreaction on the part of police and the media, and panic over class warfare. According to Suebsaeng, this underscores Parker and Stone's formula for mining politics for crude, contrarian humor rather than taking it too seriously.Suebsaeng, Asawin. \\"South Park on Occupy Wall Street\\".

They were one of the earliest punk bands in San Francisco, and later took on a darker, moodier post-punk sound before breaking up in 1981. The band was made up of vocalist/lyricist Ricky Williams, guitarist Michael Belfer, bassist Paul Draper, and drummer Tim Mooney. Biography The band formed in Palo Alto, California, in 1978. Michael Belfer had been trying to form a band with his friend, Tim Mooney, and Belfer had decided he wanted former Crime drummer Ricky Williams for vocals, as \\"he was so awesome looking\\". The band's compositions were spontaneous, as lyricist Williams didn't have the discipline to write out lyrics, but had \\"fantastic improvisational abilities\\". The band released a five-track 7-inch EP in late 1978, and then broke up, with Belfer playing in Tuxedomoon during 1978 and 1979, and Williams co-founding Flipper, from which he was fired before the band made any recordings \\"for being too weird\\". In 1980, the band reformed and released a single, \\"Mirror\\"/\\"Theory\\", and an album, Painless Nights. The new lineup on the LP featured Brian MacLeod (drums), Ron MacLeod (bass), and Mike White (guitar/effects). Williams' abuse of speed led to erratic and violent behavior, which culminated in his passing out on stage on the second date of the group's East Coast tour at New York's Hurrah. The band broke up onstage after this incident. Belfer returned to college and graduated in composition and cultural studies. He played guitar and keyboards in Black Lab from 1996 to 1999. Williams went on to handle vocals in Toiling Midgets, and later died of a heroin overdose at the age of 37 in 1992.

Located in Uttarpara, a small town on the banks of the Hoogly river, this library was established by Babu Jaykrishna Mukherjee and opened to the public in 1859. At present, the library has been declared a Group ‚ÄòA‚Äô Library by the West Bengal State Government. Efforts are being made to have it declared an Institution of National Importance. History =Sri Jayakrishna Mukherjee= The Uttarpara Jaykrishna Public Library was founded by Jaykrishna Mukherjee, a prominent Bengali landlord (zamindar) and social reformer. Born in 1808 in Uttarpara, Jaykrishna was the son of a clerk and businessman, Jagan Mohun Mukherjee. He travelled with Jagan Mohun to Meerut at the age of 8, and was enrolled in a regimental school there. In the latter part of 1824, he participated with his father in the campaign against Bharatpur. In 1830, he became a record-keeper in the office of the Collector of Land Revenue at Hooghly. During this time, several estates were put up for sale due to the agricultural depression caused by severe flooding. Jaykrishna Mukherjee bought these estates, notably those of the Singur Babus. With time, and further acquisition, Jaykrishna Mukherjee‚Äôs reputation as a prominent landholder began to equal that of Dwarkanath Tagore. In fact, in 1838, when Dwarkanath established the Landholders Society, Jaykrishna was elected as a member. An ardent social reformer and nationalist, Jaykrishna Mukherjee spearheaded the effort to establish a municipality in Uttarpara after the 1851 cholera epidemic there. As a result of his efforts, the Uttarpara Municipality was formed in the latter part of 1851. Jaykrishna also established many schools in Uttarpara, for both boys and girls, and the Uttarpara College. He donated Rs. 10,000 towards the establishment of the Bethune College (founded by the Honorable Drinkwater Bethune) and Rs. 5000 towards the Calcutta University Library. Apart from conducting very many agricultural reforms, he was also socio- politically active. He was the first signatory of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar‚Äôs memorial for legalizing widow marriage. He was a member of the Indian National Congress; his speech proposing Dadabhai Naoroji as president of the Second Indian National Congress (held in Calcutta in 1886) was much acclaimed. This is indicated by Mr. A. O. Hume describing Jaykrishna as \\"the Nestor of the Bengal conservatives\\". =The Library= On 15 April 1859, Jaykrishna Mukherjee formally opened the first free Public Library in India (and perhaps in Asia as well). This library, known as the Uttarpara Public Library, was originally Jaykrishna‚Äôs personal collection and open to researchers as early as 1851. Influenced by Dwarkanath Tagore and in light of the Public Library Act of 1850 (in Britain), Jaykrishna wanted to do something to spread public education and increase scholarship in Bengal. In the August 1854, he submitted a proposal, for a public library at Uttarpara, to the Divisional Commissioner of Burdwan. He was willing to donate Rs. 5000 towards this. The proposal failed, and Jaykrishna went ahead and funded the entire library by himself. The library building, a palatial construction by the side of the Hooghly, started being constructed in 1856. The land area was one acre and the entire construction cost him Rs. 85000. The staff appointed was initially 7 people: a librarian, an assistant librarian, a clerk, two gardeners, one sweeper, and one durwan. He also appointed a group of Uttarpara citizens as curators of the library. To them he \\"has made over a landed estate yielding Rs. 1800 a year; but as more works of English and Sanscrit [were] yet to be added, he [had] made a separate provision for the same.\\" Initially, the library held around 3000 books and many periodicals: all from Jaykrishna‚Äôs private collection. He procured more books and periodicals from diverse sources: he bought them from the fund of the charitable Devottara trust formed by his father, bought rare collections from the Bengal Harkara Library, and he also bought books from the sellers at China Bazar. By 1865, the library had 12000 books in English and 2500 books in Bengali and Sanskrit. As of now, the library has 45000 old and rare books (most of them from the 17th to the 19th century); 65000 new books (both Bengali and English); 2500 old periodicals; 20000 new (and bound) periodicals; and 450 manuscripts. As Sir William Hunter had said, it is \\"a unique storehouse of local literature alike in English and vernacular tongues.\\" The library contains some old and rare volumes of periodicals in both Bengali and English: Dig Darshan, Sangbad Rasaraj, Somprakash, Tatvabodhini, Calcutta Monthly Journal, and Bengal Chronicle to name just a few. Apart from containing the early 19th century publications of pioneers such as William Carey, Marshman, Ward, Halhade, Rammohan, etc.; the library also contains The Holy Bible in Sanskrit, Dictionary of Chemistry, Sanskrit Grammar in Devnagri and Roman Letters by Max Muller, Reports at Westminster London (1658), Parliamentary Reports (1649), Charters of the East India Company, East India Pamphlets (1812), Reports on Public Instruction (1839), etc. Other documents include \\"Wellington‚Äôs dispatches, State Secret Papers, British Review, American Quarterly Review, Edinbourough Review, Travelogues, Dictionaries, Memoirs, Topographical and Geographical Accounts, Annecdotes, Almanacs, Law Reports, Gazetteers, and many more.\\" All this aside from the 200 Sanskrit palm-leaf, plantain-leaf, and handmade paper manuscripts collected from Benaras, Kashmir, and the monasteries of Tibet. Most of the titles included in the Descriptive Catalogue of Vernacular Books and Pamphlets by Rev. James Long are from this library. Also available are Rammohan Roy‚Äôs Gaudiya Vyakaran, Mrittyunjoy Vidyalankar‚Äôs Rajabali, Madhusudhan‚Äôs Hectorbadh Kavya, Baidyanath Acharya‚Äôs Agyan Timir Nahak, Nrisinghadeb Ghosal‚Äôs Visvagyan O Brahmagyan, Brajendralal Vidyalankar‚Äôs Udvidvidya, Kalipada Mukhoadhyay‚Äôs Rasasindhu Premavilas, Pramanthanath Sharma‚Äôs Nabababu Bilas, Upendralal Mitra‚Äôs Bastu Parichay, and Gadhadhar Bhattacharya‚Äôs Shathik Muktibad. =Famous Visitors= Rather than being merely a library, the Uttarpara Jaykrishna Public Library was also a place where intellectuals met, and carried out their studies in peace while residing there. In 1866, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar came to visit the library with the noted educationist Mary Carpenter. Consequently, in her book \\"Six months in India\\", Miss Carpenter spends a not insignificant amount of space speaking about the library. She informs us that \\"the lower storey of the building contains the library, and the upper rooms are reserved to accommodate respectable visitors, as well as to hold public meetings ‚Ä¶.\\" The list of these \\"respectable visitors\\" includes the names of stalwarts like Michael Madhusudan Dutta (who stayed there with his family for 2 months in 1869 and then, again, in 1873); Sir. William Wilson Hunter; John H. S. Cunningham; Rev. James Long; Sir Arthur Wellesley; Sir Ashley Eden; Sir Edwin Arnold; Sir Rivers Thompson; Marquis of Dufferin and Ava Dufferin; Surendranath Banerjee; Keshab Chandra Sen; Bipin Pal; and Swami Vivekananda. On 30 May 1909, Sri Aurobindo gave his famous ‚ÄòUttarpara Speech‚Äô on the grounds of the Library. =Situation Post 1888= It was Jaykrishna‚Äôs desire that the library would be managed by a Board of Curators after his demise. He expired in 1888, and the library was involved in a series of financial problems and litigations. This magnificent building and its remarkable collection suffered from a lack of care and maintenance. In 1911, the Library management Trust tried to get the institution assigned with the Treasurer of Charitable Institutions, but were unsuccessful. The attempt was repeated in 1953, but this was unsuccessful as well. Earlier, in 1949 and 1951, the Board of Curators had made proposals to the Government for a take- over of the Library. With no help in sight, the people of Uttarpara, especially the youngsters, tried to rescue this heritage institution. Organizations like Sri Madhusudan Sahitya Sangha and Uttarpara Sammilani (founded by Sri Amendra Nath Chattopadhyay) worked with the Board of Curators to bring the library to the government‚Äôs notice. In 1954, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, paid the library a visit and gave an assurance that he would do the needful. Although reform proposals were drafted and forwarded to the Chief Minister in June and, later November, 1955 there was no substantial change in the situation till 1958. In April 1958, the library was awarded the status of an ‚ÄòArea Library‚Äô (a partial fulfilment of the take-over demand) with the sanction of Rs. 64000 as an annual maintenance grant. There was a further deputation by the Board of Curators to the then chief minister Sri Prafulla Chandra Sen in 1963. As a result, on 8 May 1963, the library building came to be requisitioned by the government. At last, on 15 June 1964, the Uttarpara Public Library was taken over by the Government of West Bengal as a District Library by invoking the charitable Endowment Act of 1890. However, the library has not yet been declared an institute of national importance and, although it is helped financially by the state government (through annual grants and special grants from time to time), the library is in need of further modernization and financial help. Pratibha Patil, the 12th president of India, participated in the 150th year celebration of the library. Apart from forwarding the request for support to the Ministry of Culture of the Government of India, Smt. Patil also donated rupees 10 lakh towards the preservation of books in the library.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The Japan Trust, launched in 1981, is the longest established existing Japanese investment trust, having survived the ebb and flow of corporate activity in the Japanese sector. The first specialist Japanese investment trust was launched in the early 1970s, as Japan, undergoing rapid economic expansion, eased its restrictions on foreigners owning shares. Several other trusts were launched over the next few years and by the time the Company was listed in December 1981 there were five Japanese investment trusts in existence. The Japanese investment trust sector is now regarded as being divided into two: general Japan and small company Japan. The Company, despite its specialisation in medium and small sized companies, is categorised as a general trust given that it is not a pure small capital specialist. The managers do have permission to buy large companies where either there are no small ones in the sector, or where the investment opportunity seems especially attractive. In order to improve liquidity in its shares, in November 2000 the Company had a 5:1 stock split. Since its incorporation, the Company has had two tranches of warrants issued and subsequently exercised. One distinctive feature of the Company is that it has had nineteen continuation votes, which are now held annually. The most recent continuation vote was held on Friday 2 December 2016.

His fields of research are urban anthropology, political anthropology, anthropology of globalization and alter-globalization.  Works  =The globalization of riots= In his book \\"Le temps des √©meutes\\" (The Time of the Riots - this book has not yet been translated into English), Alain Bertho argues that globalization does not only affect economic exchange. The riot, social phenomenon that we often wrongly reduce to a one-off and isolated event, is developing all over the world. In view of the past ten years, according to Alain Bertho, no country is immune to these outbreaks of violence. The record of events reveals a great diversity of causes and profiles: political upheavals (Tibet and Algeria in 2008), overflows with the death of a young person (Australia and France in the early 2000), communal clashes (United Kingdom, India and the United States in the late 1980s and into the next decade), suburban crisis (as in France in 2005), riots following a price increase (Venezuela, Brazil ...) and so on. However, the author says, as much as these events are short and violent, they are quickly relegated to the shadows of history. It is therefore necessary both to recall the novelty, to measure the extent and especially to understand its meaning. * A first common feature of many riots today is their urban location. The city is where took place all the land issues. However, because they can produce stigma and forced mobility, renewal policies are undermining the social cohesion and sharpened tensions. * At a time when capitalism digests somehow its financial follies, the struggle for decent living conditions is another common characteristic (protest against high prices in Guyana, responding to power cuts in Guinea ...). * The youthful character of the people protesting is also remarkable. High-profiled, thanks to the Internet in particular, the riots are to be finally understood as an expression of discontent. * They sign the end of modern politics into a period where, all over the world, states recombine their actions and where global governance has effects in the lives of all of us. * But the riot is not only a symptom of crisis, it also carries a strong demand, namely the possibility of communication through channels other than those of traditional institutions. It remains to find the forms of this dialogue so that, finally, the violence is no longer the main way to tell his anger and protest against the world as it goes. =International Observatory on Suburbs and Outskirts= With the French anthropologist Sylvain Lazarus, Alain Bertho has founded in 2008 l'Observatoire international des banlieues et des p√©riph√©ries (OIBP) and produces researches in France, Brazil and Senegal.

It contains significant reserves of fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, and oil - although there are incentives to phase these out in favour of clean energy. The state also contains large amounts of uranium, including the world's single biggest deposit at Olympic Dam, which represents 30% of the world's total resource. More recently, the State has seen a rapid increase in investment in renewable energy, and is now the leading producer of wind power in Australia. South Australia has been noted for the availability of hot rocks suitable for geothermal electricity generation. The South Australian Government has released plans to make South Australia a green energy hub for Australia's eastern seaboard. Coal Historically, much of South Australia's electricity was generated by coal- fuelled power stations. The Electricity Trust of South Australia nationalised the main private generator and the electricity grid that covered most of the populated parts of the state in the 1940s. Initially, the power stations burned coal imported from the eastern states of Australia. The government decided that South Australia needed to be more self-sufficient. In the 1950s, it established the Telford Cut coal mine near Leigh Creek and built the Playford A Power Station near Port Augusta specifically designed to burn South Australian coal. It was joined in the 1960s by the Playford B Power Station. The last and largest coal power station built in South Australia was the Northern Power Station, built near the Playford stations in the 1980s. It was also the last coal fired power station to close, in 2016.  Electricity = Renewable energy initiatives and potential = South Australia leads the nation in terms of renewable energy commercialization; with 7.14% of the nation's population, it captures 56% of the grid connected wind power, 30% of solar power and 90% of its geothermal developments. Given its reputation as having some of the windiest and sunniest places in Australia, South Australia is considered to be a target for green energy investors. The Australian Government has invested AUD 1 million dollars commissioning a study by Macquarie Capital, WorleyParsons and Baker & McKenzie to investigate the state's electricity transmission capacity and potential for expansion of renewable energy in South Australia. This study proposes that increasing the transmission capacity will unlock an estimated AUD 6 billion in renewable energy investment that will generate up to 5000 MW of clean and green energy The Economic Development Board has recommended that the State make use of its unique natural advantages in generating wind, solar, geothermal and wave energy enabling the region to maintain its leading position in the development and use of \\"green\\" energy and establishing a significant renewable energy industry. An AUD 20 million renewable energy fund under the supervision of newly formed Renewable SA Board has been established. The first investment of AUD 1.6 million will be spent over two years to create a South Australian Centre for Geothermal Research, in conjunction with the University of Adelaide. The Fund will boost up investment in research and development, examine opportunities for manufacturing, and help assess how to develop a \\"green grid\\" based in South Australia but linked directly into the national power grid. Two utilities have deployed house batteries to provide grid services in a virtual power plant and reduce need for network upgrades. However, such installations only provide synthetic inertia which is excluded from the 2017 energy security target.http://statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/upload/energy/energy%20security%20target/Electricity- Security-Target-Variation-Regulation.pdf?t=1494407532403 By 2017, South Australia had enough installed wind generation, with more wind and solar generation under development, that sometimes renewable energy could satisfy the entire electricity grid demand. However many of the facilities did not provide technical system strength to ensure that the grid remained stable and reliable under fluctuations in supply or demand. This meant that even when the wind was blowing strongly, the Australian Energy Market Operator demanded that a number of gas-fired generators be turned on to provide system inertia. ElectraNet sought tenders to provide this system strength to the network, however determined that all of the offers were too expensive. In 2019, ElectraNet announced that it proposed to install four synchronous condensers on the grid in South Australia. It proposes to build a pair at Davenport near Port Augusta and a second pair near Robertstown. They are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2020. = Geothermal = \\"Geothermal energy\\" refers to the heat generated naturally by the earth, which can be used for the production of electricity. One of the greatest advantages of geothermal energy is said to be the reduction in CO2 emission. Unlike some other energy alternatives, which rely on intermittent supply of sunlight or wind, geothermal power generation can be used, like more traditional sources, for long term base-load power 24/7. South Australia hosts significant geothermal resources, with a surface heat flow of 92 ¬± 10 mW m2, compared to a heat flow of 49-54 mW m2 in geologically similar regions. Unlike many other parts of the world such as New Zealand and Iceland where geothermal energy sources result from circulating groundwater heated by a shallow magma source, heat flow in South Australia primarily results from elevated concentrations of radiogenic elements such as uranium, thorium and potassium in granitic basement rocks. The radiogenic concentration of basement rock in the South Australian Heat Flow Anomaly (SAHFA) is over three times greater than the global mean for similar regions. Thick layers of overlying sediment insulate and trap in the deeper heat. Due to the low permeability of granite, the hot rocks must undergo hydraulic fracturing and be stimulated to allow a flow of water through the system to produce energy. This heat is slowly conducted to shallower rocks near the surface. Petratherm propose developing the geothermal energy in the more permeable sedimentary rocks that overlay the hot granite, a process called Heat Exchange Within Insulator (HEWI). While somewhat cooler, in many cases they do not require hydraulic fracturing. It is estimated that one percent of geothermal energy shallower than five kilometres below the earth's surface and hotter than 150 ¬∞C can supply Australia's total energy requirement for 26000 years. South Australia and Tasmania, where the granite basement rocks are suitable, are the main locations where geothermal energy is being developed in Australia. Sedimentary style geothermal resources have also been located near the south Victorian coastline stretching across South Australia. Geothermal energy has already been utilized commercially at two South Australian locations. Birdsville generates geothermal electricity from the hot water from the great artesian basin there, and a geothermal district heating scheme at Portland has been in use for the last twenty years, supplied by the hot water of the Otway Basin. Many companies in Australia have engaged in developing geothermal energy for full-scale commercial deployment. Both the state and federal government are making efforts to support and sponsor research for realizing geothermal energy commercially. The South Australian Centre for Geothermal Energy Research (SACGER) was established in 2010 as a part of the state government's Renewable Energy Fund in order to promote a world class hub for practical, high priority geothermal energy research. This 3.6 million dollar funding will help South Australia to reach its target of producing 33% of renewable energy by 2020. Apart from designing geophysical tools, imaging the possible geothermal reservoirs, improving simulation of fracture and fluid networks in geothermal reservoirs, SACGER is also involved in developing trace elements micro-analytical imaging facilities for South Australia through key analytical infrastructure advances and mapping fracture systems in South Australian geothermal reservoir analogues. In order to promote and encourage exploration in Australia, Geo-science Australia has taken initiatives to identify the hot spots of active geothermal regions for supporting geothermal industry. Onshore Energy Security Program, an initiative by the federal government, has been set up a field logging program to improve the heat flow coverage of Australia. OzTemp database, another product by Somerville et al. (1994 - Geotherm94 database) at the Bureau of Minerals Resources (now Geo-science Australia) and the Energy Research and Development Corporation, is designed to measure temperature from different sources and extrapolate these to five kilometers' depth. = Wind = Wind energy is a popular alternative to the fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil in terms of better sustainability, economically feasible and environmental friendly. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) 2010 SA Supply Demand Outlook estimates that in 2009‚Äì10, 18% of the state's energy production came from wind power. In July 2014, South Australian wind farms produced enough power to meet 43% of the state's electricity needs, up from the previous record of 38% in August 2013. South Australia is the largest producer of wind energy in Australia, as of April 2011 hosting 49% of the nation's installed capacity. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established to encourage further investment in renewable energy to the state. There are currently 16 wind farms operating across the state with an installed capacity of 1,473 MW of power.Government of South Australia: \\"Wind energy in South Australia\\" , updated 4 August 2014, retrieved 4 November 2014 As of December 2010, South Australia had thirteen operational wind farms, with an installed capacity of 1,018 MW. By August 2014 this has increased to 1,473 MW, accounting for 27 per cent of electricity production. As of late 2015 there are more new wind farms in various stages of planning but only one under construction, the Hornsdale Wind Farm. South Australia has provided regulatory certainty for wind farms, and the government has implemented land use planning policies which represent national best practice for accommodating wind farms. On 2 June 2009, Premier Mike Rann announced plans to increase South Australia's renewable energy production target to 33% by 2020, well above the national target of 20% by 2020.Government of South Australia (8 December 2010). Renewable Energy in South Australia = Solar = As a part of the initiative to depend more on sustainable energy and reduction in carbon emission, the Australian Government is promoting the usage and installation of solar hot water. Another initiative is the South Australian Government's Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme, which supplies rebates up to for the installation of a domestic hot water solar heater. Additionally, the Australian Federal Government's Solar Hot Water Rebate programme can earn a rebate up to . Another solar project in Adelaide is the Adelaide Solar City Programme, which plans a 50 kW rooftop solar photovoltaic system. The installation will comprise 288 solar panels. This system will be installed on the roof of a historical market building which according to Dario De Bortoli, Adelaide Solar City Program Manager, is a proof of the fact that solar power systems can be installed even in historical buildings without much renovation. Adelaide started a feasibility study in 2014 as to whether the country's first solar thermal power plant should be built at Port Augusta, South Australia. The solar thermal power generation focuses sunlight onto an absorber and a pipe containing special fluid. The heated fluid is piped through a heat exchanger to create steam that will drive a steam turbine to generate enough power to supply up to 40% of the state electricity demand. In 2016, a combined greenhouse, desalination plant and solar thermal plant opened near Port Augusta as a private development not exporting electricity to the grid. Several other solar power stations are proposed or under development in the Port Augusta area, using either solar thermal or photovoltaic technology. Bungala Solar Power Project was the first grid-connected solar power station in South Australia when stage 1 started generating in May 2018. In September 2018, the South Australian Government announced that it would offer $100M in state government subsidies for up to 40,000 households to install battery storage in their homes. Eligible home owners and renters could receive $500 per kWh up to a maximum of $6,000 for eligible solar and battery systems =Other= South Australia's only hydroelectric generation is the Terminal Storage Mini Hydro installed in SA Water supply pipes in a northeastern suburb of Adelaide. It generates electricity from water flowing downhill from one storage dam to the \\"terminal storage\\" facility that feeds into the metropolitan water distribution network. There are also small electricity generators using collected waste gasses at several of the metropolitan waste water treatment plants and the large landfill dump at Wingfield north of Adelaide. =Storage= The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a bank of grid-connected batteries adjacent to the Hornsdale Wind Farm. At the time of construction in late 2017, it was billed as the largest lithium-ion battery in the world. The Dalrymple ESCRI battery is a 30MW / 8MWh battery installed on Yorke Peninsula owned by Electranet and operated by AGL Energy. It provides strengthened grid reliability on the peninsula in particular and South Australia generally. It was commissioned in June 2018. =Prices= Quarantine Power Station, Adelaide The 2013 South Australian Electricity Report noted that increases in prices were \\"largely driven by transmission and distribution network price increases\\". In contrast, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has noted that the South Australian wholesale prices are lower than they have been since the start of the national electricity market, and that the wind ‚Äútends to depress the South Australian regional prices‚Äù.Power of the wind - how renewables are lowering SA electricity bills The Government stated that the price increase due to the Carbon Tax was approximately half of that experienced by other states, due to the high installed capacity of wind and gas-fired generation.Electricity and gas prices to jump 18% in SA Following the 2016 South Australian blackout, the South Australian government increased its ministerial powers to direct energy corporations in times of peak demand. It was claimed in 2017 that South Australia had the most expensive electricity in the world Another analysis claimed that South Australia has the second cheapest electricity in Australia.

He wrote the setting of Friedrich Schiller's ballad for cello and speaking voice in 2005. It was published in 2007 in Heinrichshofen's Verlag.  History of cello and speaking voice  Graham Waterhouse composed Der Handschuh in 2005, as a kind of melodrama in the tradition of spoken narrative to instrumental accompaniment, such as ballads by Robert Schumann and Richard Strauss, a crucial scene of Weber's opera Der Freisch√ºtz and 20th century settings by Schoenberg, William Walton, Henze and Poulenc's L'Histoire de Babar, le petit √©l√©phant. It is the composer's first major work for the combination of Sprechstimme (speaking voice) and his instrument, the cello. Until then he had occasionally set texts to music for the unusual scoring. In 1995 he wrote Vezza, a limerick on whether/weather as a German might pronounce it, recorded in 2002 with the composer speaking and playing. In 2001 he set Flohlied (Song of the Flea), the satirical song from Goethe's Faust I, to music, published by Heinrichshofen's Verlag. The final poem of his song cycle Sechs sp√§teste Lieder (six latest songs, 2003) after Friedrich H√∂lderlin for mezzo-soprano and cello is spoken. He composed Der Handschuh in 2005 for the 200th anniversary of Schiller's death. Following its success, he wrote more frequently for the combination of cello and speaking voice. In 2006 he set to music Animalia, three funny poems on animals by Hans Krieger. In 2007 he wrote Das Hexen-Einmaleins (The Witches One-Times-One), again from Goethe's Faust and published by Heinrichshofen's Verlag in 2009., the dramatic monologue Aases Himmelfahrt from Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt, Gruselett after Christian Morgenstern's nonsense poem for three speaking voices and string trio, and Belsatzar on Heinrich Heine's Romanze. In 2010 he composed Der Werwolf after a poem by Morgenstern, and a different setting The Banshee on its English version by Max Knight.  Plot and composition  The composer summarises the ballad Der Handschuh, which Schiller wrote in 1797 in a friendly ballad competition with Goethe: \\"The story is set in the reign of the French King Fran√ßois I. In it the king stages a fight between a variety of wild animals for the entertainment of his guests (we read in the \\"Essais historiques sur Paris\\" of Monsieur de Saint-Foix that an arena existed in what is now known as the \\"Rue des Lions\\" in Paris). The animals, however, prove to be placid creatures: the real contest plays itself out among the spectators, when a certain Dame Cunigund challenges her lover to demonstrate his affection for her by retrieving a glove she had affected to let fall accidentally into the arena. This he does, to the amazement of the crowd; at the end, however, events take an unexpected turn.\\" The different actors, including the animals, are portrayed musically in leitmotifs. The piece is intended to be performed by one person reciting and playing, but can also be performed by a cellist and a speaker.  Performances  The composer has frequently performed the work speaking and playing simultaneously. He showed it in 2005 in a portrait concert in St. Martin, Idstein, and in a Gespr√§chskonzert (lecture concert) in W√ºrzburg. In 2008 he performed it in Cambridge in a program \\"Melodrama revisited ‚Äì new compositions for cello and speaking voice\\", while he was a \\"Musician By-Fellow\\" at Churchill College. The program was repeated for a composer's colloquium at the University of Oldenburg, conducted by Violeta Dinescu. Waterhouse also performed the work with a speaker, such as Gerd Udo Feller (in German) at the Gasteig Munich on 14 December 2008, in a program with works by Bach, Pablo Neruda, Benjamin Britten, Paul Hindemith, and with other settings for cello and speaking voice by Waterhouse. On 12 December 2011 he performed it with speaker Peter Wei√ü (in German) in a family concert in Gilching, together with Flohlied and Der Werwolf.  Publication  Der Handschuh was published in 2007 in both German and English by Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, which also published Flohlied, Das Hexen-Einmaleins and Gruselett.

Facts  Standard Bank had issued a summons against Saunderson, asking for a judgement on debt owing and ancillary orders declaring the mortgaged property to be executable. Saunderson failed to defend. The bank sought a default judgment under the Uniform Rules of Court, which provides that, > whenever a defendant is in default of delivery of notice of intention to > defend or of a plea, the plaintiff, if he or she wishes to obtain judgment > by default, shall file with the Registrar a written application for judgment > against the defendant. The registrar may then \\"grant judgment as requested.\\"s 31(5). The matter was dealt with in open court on the direction of the Deputy Judge President. The High Court granted a default judgement, but the execution was declined. The court held that the effect of the registration of a mortgage bond is that the borrower, by his own volition, compromises his rights of ownership until the debt is repaid. The bond curtails the right of property at its root, penetrating the rights of ownership, for the bondholder's rights are fused into the title itself. Relying on Jaftha v Schoeman,2005 (2) SA 140 (CC). the court held that, since the mortgaged property was residential, the onus was on the bank to show that execution was permissible in terms of the Constitution: There should have been averments to the effect that the facts disclosed were sufficient to justify execution in terms of the right of access to adequate housing.s 26(1). The bank had to show that its applications were a justifiable limitation of that right. Because the summonses lacked such averments, they could not sustain an order of execution.  Judgment  On appeal to the SCA, it was found that the court a quo had misdirected itself; in particular, that # \\"that s 26(1) does not confer a right of access to housing per se but only a right of access to 'adequate' housing,\\" so that the right is \\"relative;\\"273H.What constituted \\"adequate\\" was a fact-based enquiry. # that Jaftha did not find that all residential property was subject to section 26(1);274B. # that the situation in Jaftha was \\"radically different\\" to the present one,274C. as it involved a lack of judicial oversight, resulting in the debtor's being deprived of title to a home because of his failure to pay a \\"trifling extraneous debt,\\"274D. and as the creditor was not a mortgagee with rights arising from an agreement;274D-E. and # that, since most debtors do not defend cases, it is important that they be notified that the execution may infringe on their constitutional right of access to housing.

Goldsmith (1892-1964). According to Goldsmith, the Message of the Infinite Way is a spiritual teaching consisting of principles which anyone may follow and practice, irrespective of their religious affiliation. The Infinite Way reveals the nature of God to be one infinite, eternal power, presence, intelligence, and love; the nature of the individual being to be one with God's qualities and character, expressed in infinite forms and variety; and the nature of the discords of this world to be a misconception of God's expression of Himself in His universe.\\"Goldsmith, J.S.

Facts  Elsie Gundwana bought a home through a loan provided by the bank, securing her debt by a mortgage bond on the property. When subsequently she fell into arrears, the bank obtained, by default judgement, an order declaring her property to be executable. The property was accordingly sold four years later. An order for eviction was sought against Ms Gundwana, and the matter ended up at the Constitutional Court.  Issue  Gundwana sought orders that the registrar, acting under the Uniform Rules of Court,s 31(5). could not grant an order declaring a mortgaged home to be executable.  Judgment  The court held that the registrar's order, under section 31(5) of the Uniform Rules of Court, declaring residential property to be executable, was unconstitutional, because judicial oversight is required where execution is sought against indigent debtors.  Consequences  The Uniform Rules of Court now contains an amendment46(1). dealing with the consequences of this judgment: > (1)(a) No writ of execution against the immovable property of any judgment > debtor shall issue until‚Äî :(i) a return shall have been made of any process > which may have been issued against the movable property of the judgment > debtor from which it appears that the said person has not sufficient movable > property to satisfy the writ; or :(ii) such immovable property shall have > been declared to be specially executable by the court or, in the case of a > judgment granted in terms of rule 31(5), by the registrar: Provided that, > where the property sought to be attached is the primary residence of the > judgment debtor, no writ shall issue unless the court, having considered all > the relevant circumstances, orders execution against such property.

Oxy. 654 Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 654 (P. Oxy. 654) is a papyrus fragment of the logia of Jesus written in Greek. It is one of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri discovered by Grenfell and Hunt between 1897 and 1904 in the Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus. The fragment is dated to the middle or late of the 3rd century. It is one of only three Greek manuscripts of the Gospel of Thomas.  Description  The manuscript was written on papyrus in scroll form. The measurements of the original leaf were 142 mm by 155 mm. The text is written in cursive letters, in a competent hand.Larry Hurtado, The Earliest Christian Artifacts (Wm. Eerdmans 2006), p. 228. It uses diaeresis over initial upsilon; two corrections were made. The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated way ( for Jesus).Larry Hurtado, The Earliest Christian Artifacts (Wm. Eerdmans 2006), p. 240. According to Grenfell and Hunt, who identified this fragment as Logia Iesu (\\"Sayings of Jesus\\"), the original manuscript contained a collection of Jesus's sayings. They suggested that original manuscript could be a part of the Gospel of Thomas, or Gospel of Philip. The only complete copy of the Gospel of Thomas was found in 1945 when a Coptic version was discovered at Nag Hammadi with a collection of early Christian Gnostic texts. The fragment contains logia (sayings) 1‚Äì7 of the Gospel of Thomas on the verso side of the leaf (opisthograph). Grenfell and Hunt also discovered another two fragments of this apocryphal Gospel: P.

This plant is unlikely to be confused with any other.Anderson, D.G. (2004, August 9). Gilia sedifolia Brandeg. (stonecrop gilia): A technical conservation assessment. [Online]. USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region. It is a perennial herb growing from a taproot, reaching only a short stature. The leaves are linear in shape and succulent in texture, resembling those of stonecrops (Sedum), giving the species its name. The inflorescence is a spikelike cluster of blue-purple flowers. The seeds are winged. Blooming occurs in July and August, and possibly September. This plant is limited to the alpine climates of the high San Juan Mountains. It grows on white volcanic ash and sandstone talus. The local elevation is between 11,800 and 13,400 feet. Alpine avens (Geum rossii) is a dominant plant in the area, but the gilia only occurs in bare patches amidst the plant cover. This is \\"an extremely rare endemic\\" plant, with only two occurrences known. The first population was in an uncertain location and when searchers were unable to find it the plant was feared extinct. This occurrence was rediscovered in 2007. In the meantime a second occurrence was found on Half Peak; it is made up of two stands of plants totalling 1100 individuals. All the plants are on land managed by the United States Forest Service. This plant is threatened by off- road vehicle use.

The Trust invests in the markets of the Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) and of the Indian Sub-continent.

History The company was incorporated on 1 February 1989 under the name of Dealchief Public Limited Company, with an authorised share capital of 100,000 ordinary shares of ¬£1 each. The company name was changed to Pacific Horizon Investment Trust PLC on 18 July 1989, and its share capital altered, so that by 31 July 1990, the company had authorised 60,000,000 ordinary shares of 10p each and 40,872,989 issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 10p each. Dealing in the company's stock commenced on 22 September 1989 on the London Stock Exchange. Its original investment policy was to achieve capital growth by establishing itself in particular 'Horizon' economies of Asia and the Far East whose stock markets were in the process of opening up to greater inflows of foreign investment. As a consequence, investment in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia was excluded. In 1992, at the end of the financial year, the Board decided to widen the company's investment objectives so as to embrace the whole of Asia except Japan. In addition, Baillie Gifford & Co Limited were appointed as managers, replacing Tyndall International (Asia) Limited. Consequently, management of the trust moved from Hong Kong to Edinburgh.

It is a sessile suspension feeder, lives in clear water, and secretes tubes on the ocean floor. Description This species grows in colonies. Each individual achieves a length of 0.5 mm, with a total colony length of approximately 20 mm. Located on the tentacles are lateral, frontal, and frontolateral ciliary bands. These are 8-13 Œºm in length and composed of cilia. In specimens collected in Bermuda, ciliated perforations were found. These ran down the length of the arms, in particular, between the bases of other tentacles laying adjacent. Distribution Rhabdopleura normani is widely distributed along the coastlines of the Bering Sea, Norwegian Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea. It has also been found in Bermuda. Reported locations include:Beli E, Aglieri G, Strano F, Maggioni D, Telford MJ, Piraino S, Cameron CB (2018) The zoogeography of extant rhabdopleurid hemichordates (Pterobranchia: Graptolithina), with a new species from the Mediterranean Sea.

Habitat This species lives in colonies on the ocean floor. It has been found at depths ranging from 5 m to 896 m, but most commonly occurs between 100 m and 300 m. Feeding R. normani does not use mucus to capture food. Instead, it uses only a local reversal of a ciliary beat. It is also capable of rejecting unsuitable food particles employing several distinct methods. Reproduction Both sexes live together in the colonies. Females have distinctive basally-coiled tubes in which they brood their eggs, each 200 Œºm in size. As these yolky eggs develop, they cleave radially, and become larvae. These larvae are ciliated, lecithotrophic, and oblong, achieving a length of 400 Œºm. They can be identified in the following ways: *They have a yellow coloration, covered with black spots. *A deep ventral depression is present. *There is a posterior adhesive organ and an anterior apical sensory organ. *The epidermis has consistent ciliation. The ventral depression is actually a glandular epithelium, as opposed to invaginating endoderm. The larval cocoon and adult tube are secreted from this depression. Inside, the peritoneum of the coelomic cavities starts to disconnect from the main mass of the yolky mesenchyme cells. After breaking free, the larva then swims using its cilia.

The location of this Late Classic Mayan urban complex, along the east and west flow of trade, made the city a major transfer point for economic activities in the whole region. In addition, the city gave archaeologists a historical view of a secondary Mayan site. Large and extended excavation efforts have changed the overall picture of Maya social and political relationships between larger and smaller cities and challenged the prevailing view of conquest and absorption of smaller cities into the larger cities in the region. The research conducted at Pusilh√° began in 1927 and continues to this day. Location The site of Pusilh√° is located in the Toledo district of Belize in the town of San Benito Poit√©. Situated between the Poite and Pusilha rivers that run east and west may have had an impact of why the Maya urban complex was built there. The site is also located favorably between the Caribbean to the south and the Maya Mountains to the east. Pusilh√° was also situated in the region for the flow of goods and ideas from the central lowlands and southeastern periphery located in Honduras. With the major Maya urban sites of central lowlands at Caracol and Tikal and the southern lowland site of Copan, Pusilh√° was possibly a major transfer point for economic activities in the whole of the lowland region. Excavation The initial site survey was conducted in 1927 by archaeologists from the British Museum Expedition to British Honduras that was led by Thomas Joyce. The survey led to the removal of the best preserved stelae from Pusilh√° to the British Museum in London.British Museum Collection The survey yielded dates and calendrical glyphs that were included in Sylvanus G. Morley's discussion work The Inscriptions of Pet√©n. Thomas Joyce also conducted an extensive ceramics evaluation in 1929. In the intervening 70 years very little research has been done at Pusilh√°. This state of affairs has changed with research and excavations carried out by Geoffrey Braswell and the Pusilha Archaeological Project beginning in 2001. The excavation that has continued to present has exposed three major areas at the center of Pusilh√° to archaeological interpretation. History Pusilh√° has a series of confirmed occupation dates. It is known through ceramic analysis that this site is dateable to the late classic. A stela found on site indicates a late classic occupation. According to Braswell, the current excavator of the site, \\"Stela P begins with the initial series date of 9.7.0.0.0 and contains a historical retrospective date of 9.6.17.8.18 (A.D. 570), implying that the kingdom was founded shortly before the beginning of the Late Classic period\\". He does state that excavations from surrounding residential areas away from the complexes center seem to indicate an early classic occupation but additional excavation is required to confirm this for the rest of the site. Transitions in ceramics, burials and construction coupled with the usual cessation of inscriptions on stelae indicate continued occupation at Pusilh√° through to the post classic. The last official date, which is a calendar round date, occurs at 9.18.7.10.3, or A. D. 798. Political The initial excavation and surveys seem to show that politically Pusilh√° was a second tier polity. The ceramics evidence showed that there were ties to Copan and Quirigua. It also seems likely that there were connections between Tikal and Caracol as those polities rose to prominence in the Pet√©n. Based in part to the favorable location of Pusilh√° along both east and west corridors of trade and the north and south axis of influence that had Caracol to the north and Copan to the south it seemed likely that the polity was politically dependent to one of its larger neighbors. But the current archaeological evidence indicates that Pusilh√° maintained its independence. Ruling Elite The archaeological evidence indicates that Pusilh√° was a traditional Maya \\"elite\\" led urban complex. There are known to be eight rulers that are associated with the Pusilh√° emblem glyph from the late Classic period with a possible two additional from the Terminal Classic. In total there are 39 named individuals that have been discovered by the epigraphers in the hieroglyphic record. Of note is an individual who at first was linked as a ruler of Copan based on the artifactual record of that polity. K'ahk' Uti' Chan is the name of Ruler B of Pusilh√° as well as Ruler 11 at Copan and was first ascribed to be the same individual. Further research has shown that they were contemporaries to each other that had different known parentage. Site Significance The site of Pusilh√° has the one representation of bridge construction that has survived to modern time. The polity of Pusilh√° also offers a look at the quantity and quality of the stelae available for study from a secondary urban complex. This site may represent an alternative method of looking at how the Maya govern themselves that is contrary to prevailing view of conquest and absorption of smaller cities into the larger cities in the region. To truly understand this site it must be stated that research and excavation is at a very early stage and that more work is required to fully understand the place that Pusilh√° holds in the greater Maya world.

The monastery is located in the selo of Yunosheskoye on the bank of the Nurma River, a tributary of the Obnora River, in Gryazovetsky District in the southern part of Vologda Oblast, Russia. In the 17th century, this was one of the most influential monasteries in Russia. The monastery was abolished in 1924 and reestablished in 1994. As of 2011, it was one of the four acting monasteries in Vologda Oblast. History The monastery was founded by Pavel of Obnora. Pavel was looking for a remote place, and the area in the 15th century was covered by dense forests. The rules of the monastery, established by Pavel, were very strict by Russian standards. The first hegumen of the monastery was Alexios, a disciple of Pavel, and Pavel himself never took any formal role in the monastery. Some of the icons by Dionisius, one of the most famous Russian icon painters, were made in the monastery and have been preserved in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. In 1538, the monastery was destroyed by Tatars. It was rebuilt, and the existing ensemble of the monastery was formed in the 16th-18th centuries. The idea was to build an image of New Jerusalem. To this end, two artificial hills were erected, one with a church and another one with a chapel. The monastery was abolished in 1924. The buildings were used to host a school, an orphanage, and a sanatorium. It was reestablished in 1994 as a metochion of the Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery. In 2003, the Pavlo-Obnorsky Monastery became an independent entity. Architecture The ensemble of the monastery was pretty much neglected after the monastery was abolished in 1926. The restoration works started in 1990s. The ensemble consists of * The Assumption Church (1867); * The Resurrection Church, built in 1862 as a skete about from the monastery complex; * The wooden Chapel of St. Pavel of Obnora (contemporary); * The wooden Chapel of St. Pavel of Obnora at the spring (contemporary); and the cells. The Trinity Church, built between 1505 and 1516, has been demolished. The ensemble of the monastery, as well as separate buildings, are protected as cultural monuments of local significance.

It can also be considered an early example of a first-person shooter. Story The game backstory as explained in the manual is that an evil Ancient Egyptian priest has put a curse on a massive pyramid dedicated to the Sun God, Ra. Any object obstructing Ra's shrine from the Sun would be destroyed. The protagonist is an unnamed archeologist who learns that October 26, 1930, a total eclipse will obstruct the sun above Cairo, and the protagonist realized that the curse will cause the Moon to explode, devastating Earth with its debris. The protagonist then decides to travel to that pyramid and destroy the shrine to Ra, preventing the curse/prophecy. The game starts with the protagonist having just arrived with a biplane parked outside the pyramid he is about to enter, two hours before the eclipse. The player has to enter and explore the pyramid, avoid traps, trigger and activate puzzles and navigate through maze-like rooms. Causes of death include dehydration, and heart attack caused by various hazards such as falling off ledges, getting crushed by falling stones and taking hits from poison darts. Throughout the maze the player can discover treasure to accumulate the score, and also ankhs that serve as keys to locked doors. Gameplay Total Eclipse added multi-levels and stairs to the 3D environment Like the previous Freescape games developed by Major Developments, Total Eclipse takes place from the point of view of the main character, who can move freely within the 3D environment of the game. This time, however, the emphasis is more on adventure, puzzle-solving and survival; with multi-level environments to move around and explore. The key elements of the game consist of: *A water jar, with water which diminishes as the player progresses; when it is empty the player will die of dehydration. The jar can be refilled with water found around the levels. *A heart-rate monitor, which actually serves as a health indicator. When the player suffers from damage or walks around a dangerous area, the rate will go higher. The player can keep it lower by resting, sacrificing some of the available time. *A flash-light, with a limited battery-life, which allows you to explore some of the darker areas of the game. *A magnetic compass for navigation *A wrist watch which shows the remaining time. *A pistol which is used for manipulating the environment, such as shooting at doors, chests and mechanisms to open or trigger them. There are also a few enemies. Items that can be found in the pyramid are *Pairs of symbols, which the player must shoot in order to trigger something (e.g. open a locked door) *Pools or fountains of water to fill the water jar. *Ankhs that serve as keys to barred doors; these are finite throughout the pyramid, and part of the challenge consists not wasting them. *The player can also find treasure, which simply serves as a side quest and only accumulates score. Development Total Eclipse was the third game to use the Freescape engine, which allowed the production of full three- dimensional environments using filled polygons in which the player could move around freely. However, the engine was improved for this release, adding spheres to the collection of shapes used for building the 3D environments. Like the previous Freescape-based games, it also gave the player the ability to 'crouch', and look up and down, as well as rotate left and right, something which was rare amongst 3D games of the time. The same engine was used for its sequel, Total Eclipse II: The Sphinx Jinx. Reception Amiga/ST Format gave Total Eclipse a score of 78% in its July issue of 1989, bemoaning the similarity to previous Freescape games as its biggest downfall. The reviewer, Gary Barett, concluded, \\"Do not misunderstand me, though, Total Eclipse is the best of Freescape games, but the originality has gone\\". Zzap! awarded a higher score of 84%, praising the game's moody music and claustrophobic feel, and stating that \\"Dark Side comes close in terms of realism but to my mind Total Eclipse has a lot better atmosphere\\".

It is remarkable for the two ancient sphinxes that were brought from Egypt to Russia at the height of Egyptomania in 1832. The quay was completed in 1834.  History  The acquisition of sphinxes at the University embankment in front of the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg is credited to Andrei Muravyov, who in 1830 was going on a pilgrimage to holy places. In Alexandria he saw the sphinxes, which were brought for sale. Ancient sculptures made him so impressed that he immediately sent a letter to the Russian Ambassador, in which he proposed to acquire them. From the Embassy the letter was directed to St. Petersburg. There its receiver, Nicholas I, redirected the message to the Russian Academy of Arts. In the end, such a purchase was deemed expedient, but by the time these bureaucratic complications were resolved, the owner had already sold the sphinxes to France. Only because of the French Revolution they at last arrived in Saint Petersburg in 1832. The first two years they spent in the courtyard of the Russian Academy of Arts. This time was spent on the creation of a pier at the embankment nearby, which was designed by the architect Konstantin Thon. The sphinxes took their places on the waterfront in 1834.  Description  The Saint Petersburg Sphinxes are about 3500 years old. They are made from syenite and initially were in front of a magnificent temple, which was built in Egypt near Thebes (Luxor) for the 18th dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III. Their faces are portraits of Amenhotep III and the shape of their headwear (crowns \\"pa shemti\\") indicate that he was the ruler of two kingdoms‚Äîthe Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. The sphinxes weigh about 23 tons each.

Section 331 of the Gambling Act 2005 forbids all countries, territories or jurisdictions that are not part of the EEA and are located outside the UK and Gibraltar to advertise their gambling services on the territory of the UK. An exception is made only for those jurisdictions that proved that they meet the requirements set by the Gambling Act 2005 and listed in a special guidance document,Whitelisting criteria issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. According to this document, the government or other authority of those countries, territories or jurisdictions that wish to advertise their gambling services in the UK, have to submit representations to the Secretary of State. The latter assesses the representations considering the criteria listed in the guidance document and decides whether to allow the country to advertise on the territory of the UK (adding the country to the whitelist) or rejecting the application.Gambling: Ad Ban These rules came into force on September 1, 2007 and, according to James Purnell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport at that time, introduced \\"one of the most rigorous regulatory regimes anywhere in the world.\\"Written Ministerial Statements, 16 July 2007 : Column 3WS Whitelisted jurisdictions The whitelist currently includes: *EEA countries *Alderney *Antigua and Barbuda *Gibraltar *Isle of Man *TasmaniaGambling Commission: Do I need a license ‚Äì remote?

Requirements for inclusion The guidance document is also used to inform the potential applicants of which information they have to provide to prove that they have an appropriate gambling regulatory regime, i.e. regime which achieves the objectives indicated in section 1 of the Gambling Act and under which the UK gambling regime operates. It means ensuring that: *gambling is conducted in a fair way *gambling is not a source of crime and disorder *gambling is not used to support crime *gambling doesn't affect children or vulnerable persons *gambling operators are subject to rules on money-laundering and financial probity.Ban on Gambling Advertising All jurisdictions that wish to be on the white list have to provide evidence that those gambling products that will be advertised will allow the players to: *access the game rules (including rules in English) *claim their winnings within a long enough period of time *easily get in contact with the appropriate authorities to resolve any disputes arising from using those gambling products Opponents In 2007, the Royal College of Psychiatrists made submissions to the Gambling Commission and the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport regarding the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 saying that the regulation of remote gambling, advertising of foreign operators in particular, was not compliant with objectives set by section 1 of the Gambling Act 2005. The representatives of the College asked to postpone the deregulation of the advertising of gambling.Royal College of Psychiatrists: Submission to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport In 2010, Steve Donoughue, management consultant specialising in gambling made a submission to the UK Gambling Commission, requesting the information about the procedure of checking the applicants that wish to be added to the whitelist. The Commission responded that the members of the Commission never physically visited the jurisdictions before whitelisting them. This information led to further criticism from Steve Donoughue, as he insisted that insufficient research was conducted by the authorities responsible for adding the countries to the whitelist. The white list system is being disputed by the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt who wants to stop non-UK licensed companies from promoting their activities in the UK. Hunt said that he would rather work towards creating conditions for gambling organisations to move their businesses to the UK.Session of the Select Committee: Transcript of Oral Evidence References External links *Gambling Commission *Remote Gambling Gibraltar *The Alderney Gambling Control Commission *The Gambling Supervision Commission ('GSC') - Isle of Man Category:Gambling in the United Kingdom ","title":"Whitelisted gambling jurisdictions"},{"id":"33614705","text":"George Fitzroy Seymour (Witley 8 February 1923 - Thrumpton 12 May 1994) was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1966 and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, volume 2, page 1887.

His diplomat father had been posted to La Paz in Bolivia and George's mother went too. Her brother-in-law was the 10th Lord Byron. Although he moved back to his family when they returned to London 18 months later, he spent his holidays here. At the age of 13, he was writing school essays about life as a squire - or a squarson. He fought in the Second World War between 1941 and 1942, with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (60th Rifles), and was invalided. After his uncle's death in 1949, with heavy death-duties Seymour was compelled to buy the house he had expected to inherit and, in a country auction, as many of its contents as he could afford. He borrowed ¬£50,000, (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) and by selling the majority of the estate, paid it back within the year. He held the office of High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1966‚Äì67. He was a Justice of the Peace for Nottinghamshire for over 30 years. He had been the longest-serving member on the Council of the Magistrates' Association and between 1975 and 1978 he served as chairman of the association's Juvenile Courts Committee. He also held the office of Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. He was a great supporter, benefactor and President of Thrumpton Village Cricket club from 1949.

He is notable as one of the first landscape park designers in Russia. Neelov served as a court architect in Tsarskoye Selo and worked with Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli on the construction of the Catherine Palace. Neyolov was the author of albums with plans of facades of buildings in Tsarskoye Selo (known as \\"Neyolov Albums\\"). Neyolov was one of the first architects of Russian origin working in Tsarskoye Selo.  Biography  The Marble (Palladio) bridge by Vasily Neyolov in 2008 Neyolov was born in 1721 in the family of a sergeant. He studied architecture with Savva Chevakinsky and Mikhail Zemtsov, who worked with Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli since 1744. In 1748, Neyolov was appointed a deputy architect and sent to help to design the plans of the Catherine Palace and Catherine Park in Tsarskoye Selo. In 1760 Rastrelli retired, and Neyolov became the chief architect supervising the creation of the Catherine Park. In 1770, he visited England and became strongly inspired by the English park building school. In the same year, he completed the plan of the park, which was subsequently used for the creation of the park. The role of Neyolov was not only to design bridges and pavilions, but also to choose the location of the pavilions designed by other architects, including Charles Cameron. Neyolov created the landscape part of the Catherine Park with famous romantic pavilions such as the Pyramid (1770‚Äì1771), the Admiralty and the Hermitage Kitchen (1774‚Äì1776), the \\"Chinese\\" Small and Large Whims (1770‚Äì1774, together with Johann Conrad Gerhard), the Marble (also known as Palladio, or Siberian) bridge built in the spirit of Andrea Palladio (1772‚Äì1774). To produce the Marble Bridge, Neyolov first created a wooden model of the bridge, which was sent to Yekaterinburg in order to facilitate the choice of the marble pieces. The Marble Bridge became the first classicist building in the Catherine Park. Two of his sons, Ilya and Pyotr, helped him during the creation of this park. Neyolov died in 1782 and was buried in the Kuzminsky cemetery in Tsarskoye Selo.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Park House was built in about 1717 as a town house for Elizabeth Booth. It was extended in the late 18th century, and in 1818 was converted into a hotel named the Albion Hotel. At this time the of parkland behind the house were converted into Chester's first public pleasure gardens. The gardens closed in 1865 when the Grosvenor Park was being developed, and working-class terraced houses were built on the site. At some time the name of the hotel was changed to the Talbot Hotel. The house later became used as a library, and later as a licensed premises and shop. Alterations were carried out in the 20th century. Architecture The building is constructed in brick that is rendered on the front. It has stone dressings and a grey slate roof. The architectural style is Georgian. The building is in three storeys with a semi-basement; it is symmetrical with five bays. The central bay contains a projecting porch with Tuscan columns. Seven steps lead up to the main entrance. Four steps go down to the north semi- basement, and two to the south semi-basement. At the sides of the building are rusticated quoins. Each bay on all storeys contains a sash window. The interior includes a ballroom.

Since the subordination of the monarchy under parliament, and the increasingly democratic methods of parliamentary government, there have been the questions of whether parliament holds a supreme ability to legislate and whether or not it should. Parliamentary sovereignty is a description of to what extent the Parliament of the United Kingdom does have absolute and unlimited power. It is framed in terms of the extent of authority that parliament holds, and whether there are any sorts of law that it cannot pass.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 51. In other countries, a written constitution often binds the parliament to act in a certain way, but there is no codified constitution in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, parliament is central to the institutions of state.Bradley in Jowell, Oliver (eds). p. 26. The traditional view put forward by A. V. Dicey is that parliament had the power to make any law except any law that bound its successors. Formally speaking however, the present state that is the UK is descended from the international Treaty of Union between England and Scotland in 1706/7 which led to the creation of the ‚ÄúUnited Kingdom of Great Britain‚Äù. It is clear that the terms of that Treaty stated that certain of its provisions could not be altered, for example the separate existence of the Scottish legal system,Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty of Union and formally, these restrictions are a continuing limitation on the sovereignty of the UK Parliament. This has also been reconsidered by constitutional theorists including Sir William Wade and Trevor Allan in light of the European Communities Act 1972 and other provisions relating to membership of the European Union, and the position of the Human Rights Act 1998 and any attempts to make this or other legislation entrenched. These issues remain contested, although the United Kingdom has since ceased membership of the EU. The terms \\"parliamentary sovereignty\\" and \\"parliamentary supremacy\\" are often used interchangeably. The term \\"sovereignty\\" implies a similarity to the question of national sovereignty.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 55. While writer John Austin and others have looked to combine parliamentary and national sovereignty, this view is not universally held. Whichever term is used, it relates to the existence or non-existence of limits on parliament's power in its legislative role. Although the House of Commons' dominance within the Houses of Parliament is well attested, \\"parliamentary sovereignty\\" refers to their joint power. Almost all legislation is passed with the support of the House of Lords.Bradley in Jowell, Oliver (eds). pp. 26-27. History The Statute of Proclamations of 1539 gave the King wide powers to legislate without reference to, or approval from, Parliament. At the same, it recognised the common law, existing statutory provisions, and excluded the breach of royal proclamations from the death penalty.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 52. It was repealed in 1547, but Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth both relied on royal proclamations. A review by Chief Justice Edward Coke in 1610, the Case of Proclamations, established that Parliament had the sole right to legislate, but the Crown could enforce it. The concept of parliamentary sovereignty was central to the English Civil War: Royalists argued that power held by the King, and delegated to Parliament, challenged by the Parliamentarians. The issue of taxation was a significant power struggle between Parliament and the King during the Stuart period. If Parliament had the ability to withhold funds from the monarch, then it could prevail. Direct taxation had been a matter for Parliament from the reign of Edward I, but indirect taxation continued to be a matter for the King.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 53. Royal powers were finally removed by the Bill of Rights 1689. The Bill of Rights also removed the ability of the Crown to dispense with (ignore) legislation and statutes. Such a right had culminated in the Declaration of Indulgence of 1687, which had ushered in the Glorious Revolution.Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 53-54. That led the Earl of Shaftesbury to declare in 1689, \\"The Parliament of England is that supreme and absolute power, which gives life and motion to the English government\\".Bradley in Jowell, Oliver (eds). p. 28. The Act of Settlement of 1700 removed royal power over the judiciary and defined a vote of both houses as the sole method of removing a judge.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 54. Core theory It was the view of A. V. Dicey, writing in the early twentieth century, that Parliament had \\"the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and, further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament\\". He refers to \\"England\\" but his view held for the other nations of the United Kingdom, with slightly different details. This view however side-steps the issue of the limitations formally placed on Parliament when the United Kingdom was first established in 1706/7 and the English and Scottish Parliaments surrendered, or perhaps more correctly pooled, their sovereignty into the new state. There are at least three suggested sources for this sovereignty. The first is sovereignty by Act of Parliament itself. One response, put forward by John Salmond was to reject this idea: he believed that \\"no statute can confer this power on Parliament for this would be to assume and act on the very power that is to be conferred\\". An alternative is to see sovereignty conferred by way of the repeated and unchallenged use of sovereignty through the promulgation of laws by Parliament.Bradley in Jowell, Oliver (eds). p. 29. The second possible source are the courts, that in enforcing all Acts of Parliament without exception, they have conferred sovereignty upon Parliament. The third alternative is the complex relationship between all parts of government, and their historical development. This is then assumed to be continuous and the basis for the future. However, if sovereignty was built up over time, \\"freezing\\" it at the current time seems to run contrary to that.Bradley in Jowell, Oliver (eds). pp. 29-30. A group of individuals cannot hold sovereignty, only the institution of Parliament; determining what does and does not constitute an Act of Parliament is important. This is considered a \\"manner and form\\" requirement.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 65. In the absence of a written constitution, it is a matter for the common law to make this determination. The court does not consider any procedural defects of the bill if they are present; this is called the \\"enrolled Act\\" doctrine. For example, the case of Pickin v British Railways Board was dismissed because it relied on the standing order process not having been fulfilled.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 66. However, the status of the Regency Acts is not so clear. In them, a regent acting during the infancy, incapacitation or absence of the monarch can assent to bills but cannot do so if they relate to changing the nature of monarchical inheritance or amending the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707, which protected that church in Scotland.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 67. If a regent did assent to a bill of these kinds, it may not be held to be a valid law even if it gained the approval of both houses and royal assent. Parliament may also bind successor parliaments as to their method of election and their constituent parts. For example, the Reform Act 1832 radically altered the distribution of MPs and subsequent parliaments were bound to follow the new rules or secure the agreement of the new house to change them. Similarly, only a reconstituted House of Lords could pass a bill reversing the changes of the House of Lords Act 1999 if its consent were required (unless the Parliament Acts were used).Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 63-64. However, the whole system of government could be abolished, and the next parliament would not be bound if it were not considered a successor.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 64. Application to Scotland Some jurists have suggested that the Acts of Union 1707 place limits on parliamentary sovereignty and its application to Scotland. Although no Scottish court has yet openly questioned the validity of an Act of Parliament, certain judges have raised the possibility. Thus, in MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, the Lord President (Lord Cooper) stated that \\"the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law\\", and that legislation contrary to the Act of Union would not necessarily be regarded as constitutionally valid. Also, in Gibson v Lord Advocate, Lord Keith was circumspect about how Scottish courts would deal with an Act, which would substantially alter or negate the essential provisions of the 1707 Act, such as the abolition of the Court of Session or the Church of Scotland or the substitution of English law for Scots law. The establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1998 has implications for parliamentary supremacy. For example, although nuclear power is not within its competence, the Scottish government successfully blocked the wishes of the UK government to establish new nuclear power stations in Scotland using control over planning applications which is devolved. While it remains theoretically possible to dissolve the Scottish Parliament or legislate without its consent in relation to Scotland, in practice such a move would be politically difficult. Development =Parliament Acts= The accepted rule is that the bill must be signed by both Houses of Parliament and has been granted royal assent, unless the Parliament Act procedure has been properly enacted.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 67. The Parliament Acts create a system of passing a bill without the consent of the Lords. That system does not however, extend to private or local bills, nor bills extending the length of a parliament beyond five years. However, despite the granting of the Speaker's Certificate, certifying the act to be valid, the validity of an act passed under the Parliament Acts may still be challenged in the courts. In Jackson v Attorney General, the judges decided by a seven-to-two majority that an Act that extended the life of a parliament would be considered invalid by the courts if it had been passed under the Parliament Act procedure.Le Sueur et al. (2010). p. 592. =European Union= From 1973 to 2020, the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union and its successor the three European Communities. The European Communities Act 1972 gave Community legislation the force of law in the United Kingdom:Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 71. section 2(1) reads: \\"All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties... are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed\\". The case of R v. Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame is considered decisive as to the superiority of EU law over British law. It judged that the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and section 21 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (which prevented an injunction against the Crown) should be disapplied. Alongside R v Employment Secretary, ex parte EOC, these two cases establish that any national legislation, coming into force before or after the European Communities Act 1972, cannot be applied by British courts if it contradicts Community law.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 72. The Factortame case was considered to be revolutionary by Sir William Wade, who cited in particular Lord Bridge's statement that \\"there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in areas to which they apply and to insist that... national courts must not be prohibited by rules of national law from granting interim relief in appropriate cases is no more than a logical recognition of that supremacy\\", which Wade characterises a clear statement that parliament can bind its successors and is therefore a very significant break from traditional thinking. Trevor Allan, argued, however, that the change in rule was accepted by the existing order because of strong legal reasons. Since legal reasons existed, the House of Lords had, instead, determined what the current system suggested under new circumstances and so no revolution had occurred. Section 18 of the European Union Act 2011 declared that EU law is directly applicable only through the European Communities Act or another act fulfilling the same role. Parliament legislated in 2018 to repeal the 1972 Act,European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 section 1 and in 2020 the United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU in accordance with and by virtue of that Act (albeit amended by further legislation of Parliament), demonstrating that the previous Parliament (of 1972) had not bound its successor with respect to leaving the EU. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 further declared that \\"It is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.\\"European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 section 38 =Human Rights Act= The Human Rights Act 1998 confirmed the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 72. In a white paper, the government expressed that \\"to make provision in the Bill for the courts to set aside Acts of Parliament would confer on the judiciary a general power over the decisions of Parliament which under our present constitutional arrangements they do not possess, and would be likely on occasions to draw the judiciary into serious conflict with Parliament\\". According to the theory that a parliament cannot bind its successors, any form of a Bill of Rights cannot be entrenched, and a subsequent parliament could repeal the act. In the government's words, \\"[It is our tradition] to allow any Act of Parliament to be amended or repealed by a subsequent Act of Parliament.\\" However, it would have been possible to apply human rights rules to previous (rather than future) legislation. The government also confirmed that it had no plans to devise a special [entrenchment] arrangement for the bill. Instead, it would be for courts to interpret legislation consistently with the Convention, if such an interpretation were possible. This system confirmed the formal authority of Parliament, while allowing judicial oversight. A court cannot strike down primary legislation.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 73. =Jackson v Attorney General= In Jackson v Attorney General, the appellants questioned the validity of the Parliament Act 1949. There were various arguments put forward by the appellants who were represented by Sir Sydney Kentridge QC. All nine judges accepted that the court had jurisdiction to consider whether the 1949 Act was valid.Le Sueur et al. (2010). p. 592. They looked to distinguish the case from that of Pickin v British Railways Board, where the unequivocal belief of the judges had been that \\"the courts in this country have no power to declare enacted law to be invalid\\". The judges believed that whereas Pickin had challenged the inner workings of Parliament, which a court could not do, Jackson questioned the interpretation of a statute.

It is located 167 kilometres northeast by road from Pweto, to the west of Lake Tanganyika. Location Pepa is in Moba territory in the southeast of Tanganyika province. The village is surrounded by high plateau grasslands. It was the home of the Belgian-owned Societ√© Elgima Pepa until the 1990s, a huge cattle farm that employed 1,200 local people. War During the Second Congo War (1998-2003) the region became a battle zone between government forces and rebel groups. Most of the people fled to Zambia and almost all the cattle were taken. The area between Pweto, Moba and Moliro has been called the \\"Triangle of Death\\". In 2000 the town was held by RCD-Goma forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). In April 2000 a Rwandan airforce Antonov An-8 crashed on take-off from the Pepa airstrip killing the crew of four and about 20 Rwandan soldiers including a Rwanda army major, two captains and two lieutenants. Other reports place the death toll as high as 57. In October 2000 Pepa was captured in an offensive by DRC government troops and their allies. The RCD-Goma and RPA forces counter-attacked and recaptured Pepa in November 2000. In October 2000, 10 000 AFDL troops (including Hutu, and Zimbabwean) assaulted at Mutoko Moya (west of Pepa) against 3000 Rwanda/Burundi/RCD forces, forcing them to retreat to Pepa. Zimbabwe Air Force bombers were used. 6000 RCD reinforcements crossed from Burundi across the lake to counterattack. For two days, and hundreds of casualties, there was no result. Then a light battalion was sent on a long outflanking manoeuver, which led to success. The AFDL retreated to Pweto.

By the end of the war buildings that had been used by the military were dilapidated and the community was littered with unexploded and abandoned ordnance. Pepa was an old Belgian commercial farm, in 2010 there were 200 cows left. Pepa changed hands three times in 2000, during the Second Congolese War. The Mai Mai finally occupied Pepa from 2003 until a village strike (collectively refused to work for them) forced them to leave, in 2006.Ben Rawlence, Radio Congo: Signals of Hope from Africa's Deadliest War.

She worked on Barack Obama's presidential campaign during the 2008 election, traveling as far as Montana to work for the campaign. Davidson announced her candidacy for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives after longtime Republican incumbent Mario Civera was elected to the Delaware County Council. Civera eventually resigned his state House seat, and Davidson defeated Republican school board member Maureen Carey in the general election. She is the first Democrat, first woman, and first African American to represent the 164th district. Davidson assumed office on January 4, 2011.  Controversy  On October 28, 2016, Davidson was evicted from her campaign office in Lansdowne, Delaware County. The landlord filed suit demanding $2,796.77. He was awarded the judgement by a district judge in Upper Darby. Davidson filed a countersuit that was ultimately dismissed by the court. Davidson was charged in 2018 for two accidents while using a taxpayer- funded vehicle. The story went national after yc.news announced charges had been filed against Davidson for crashing her taxpayer-funded vehicle while leaving a political fundraiser February 3, 2018 in Concord Township, Delaware County. After further investigation, yc.news discovered Davidson was involved in a second accident one month prior on January 11, 2018 where Pennsylvania State Police informed the media outlet that Davidson had fled the scene of the crash. Shortly after the news broke, it was picked up by Philly.com and distributed nationally. According to the Associated Press, Davidson was driving under a suspended license on all accidents involving the taxpayer- funded vehicle. On April 10, 2018, Pennsylvania State Representative Brad Roae and State Rep. Kristin Phillips-Hill proposed legislation to rid lawmakers of all state-lease vehicles, citing the two accidents Margo Davidson was involved in that year. Following the two accidents in her taxpayer-funded vehicle, yc.news released leaked documents on August 3, 2018 that indicated the Office of the Attorney General paid $12,000.00 to victims of a third accident but declined to make the documents public until after the primary election.

They manage and maintain a distributed computing grid across the UK with the primary aim of providing resources to particle physicists working on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN. They are funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council. The collaboration oversees a major computing facility called the Tier1 at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) along with the four Tier 2 organisations of ScotGrid, NorthGrid, SouthGrid and LondonGrid (formerly LT2). The Tier 2s are geographically distributed and are composed of computing clusters at multiple institutes. As of 2012 the GridPP infrastructure spans 18 UK institutionsUK sites displayed on CERN's GridMap Retrieved 2011-11-02 and is major partner in the UK's National Grid Initiative as a part of the European Grid Infrastructure. Background The original GridPP plan was drawn up in late 2000GridPP History to provide the UK's contribution to the LHC Computing Grid and the EuropeanDataGrid project (now the European Grid Infrastructure). The drive behind these projects was to provide researchers working on the LHC experiments with suitable computing resourcesLCG Website and to extend the use of the technology to other communities. The first GridPP proposal was accepted by PPARC, at the time the UK funding council responsible for funding particle physics related projects, and the collaboration officially began on 1 September 2001 with ¬£17m of funding. During this first phase of GridPP (2001 to 2004) the collaboration built the UK testbed, a working prototype for a grid that was linked to other similar systems around the world. In preparation for its use as a production infrastructure it analysed real data from a wide variety of experiments being run around the world in different institutions. In 2004 it was extended till September 2007 to bring it up to the proposed LHC switch on date. By 2007 GridPP was a fully functioning production service but the LHC switch on was still a year away so in September 2007 it received a further extension from STFC, receiving ¬£30m of funding until March 2011.

It was published in Canada and the United States at the end of 1971. The British newspaper The Sunday Times reproduced excerpts from the book and it was published in the United Kingdom in January 1972. Reception and criticism According to Sandra Martin of Toronto's The Globe and Mail, The Revolution Script can be seen as a \\"Truman Capote-style novel\\". Ian McGillis, for the Montreal Gazette, described it as \\"a kind of docu-novel that places the reader in the middle of the October Crisis with an immediacy that makes it feel like this morning‚Äôs news\\". Kirkus Reviews felt that Moore's attempt to \\"make the characters less than 'faceless'\\" fell short but praised his portrayal of the \\"foolhardy, insurgent enterprise\\"'s \\"catalytic tension and instantaneity\\". George Woodcock said: \\"When he is describing settings... he writes vividly and evocatively. When he reconstructs action, he is almost invariably convincing. The coating of verisimilitude, however, begins to wear thin when he tries to create dialogue between the terrorists. The Revolution Script reads then as if it were written, not by Brian Moore the novelist, but by some rather clumsy imitator of Roch Carrier, and the terrorists shape themselves in our minds as incredibly ignorant, na√Øf and pathetic, which I am sure is not Moore's intention\\". Jeanne Flood said that it was \\"the most flawed and disturbing of all Moore's books\\" and described its \\"explicit concern with media\\" as \\"nothing less than obsessive\\". She criticised as \\"unethical\\" Moore's \\"projection of the deeply personal onto public events involving real persons\\" and argued that the subject matter of the book \\"demands the scrupulous impersonality of the journalist, not the private emotional energies of the novelist\\". However, Moore's biographer, Patricia Craig, described it as \\"a compact thriller, a perfectly creditable and engrossing reconstruction of a striking sequence of events\\". Legacy An untitled film script, based on his novel and dated July 1972, is held in Moore's archives at The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The house takes its name because it stands near the site of the old Shipgate, which has been moved and rebuilt in Grosvenor Park. History The earliest parts of the house date from the 17th century, but most of its remaining fabric is from a rebuilding in the middle of the 18th century. In 1963 the house and an adjoining cottage were bought by Cheshire County Council with a view to demolishing them and building an extension to County Hall. However this was successfully opposed by the Chester Civic Trust. The house was substantially restored between 1971 and 1974. Architecture The basement is constructed in coursed sandstone, and probably dates from the 17th century. The rest of the house is in red-brown Flemish bond brick. The dressings are in stone, and the hipped roof is in grey slate. The building is in three storeys plus the basement, and has three bays. There are three steps leading down to an entrance doorway in the basement. Leading up to the entrance on the bottom storey is an L-shaped stairway of five and four steps. Over the door is a fanlight, and it has a fluted pilaster on each side. Above it is a pediment supported by modillion brackets. Each bay on every storey contains a sash window with a stone sill below and a keystone above. Between the storeys are stone bands. The projecting eaves are carried on a stone cornice beam. The interior is notable for its open-well oak staircase rising through all the floors; it has square newels, and two barleysugar balusters on each step. The house is listed at Grade II* because of its fa√ßade and its oak staircase.

It is similar in appearance to Psilocybe pelliculosa and P. silvatica, and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between them. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith in 1946. He collected the type specimen in Olympic National Park in Washington in 1941, at an elevation of . Mycologist Gast√≥n Guzm√°n classified it in the section Singeria of Psilocybe. Description The cap is obtusely conic to convex, and does not expand to become flattened with age; it reaches in diameter. Its margin is bent in slightly at first but soon straightens. The cap surface is smooth except for a faint fringe at the margin from a rudimentary veil, sticky, hygrophanous but opaque when moist, deep brown in the center and somewhat darker brown near the margin. As the mushroom matures, it fades slowly in the center to a dull cinnamon color. The pellicle rips into shreds when peeled. The pliant flesh is thin, 2 mm in the center of the cap and tapered evenly to the margin. The cap surface is covered with grayish fibrils; underneath the fibrils the color is initially the same as the cap, but becomes blackish-brown in age at the base or over lower parts. The gills are slightly darker than the cap in color, broadly adnate, but develop a slight decurrent tooth in age (when the gill separates slightly from the stem). The gills are broad (about 3 mm), with a close to subdistant spacing. Roughly 24 gills reach the cap edge from the stem; there are additionally 2 or three tiers of lamellulae‚Äîshort gills that do not extend completely from the stem to the cap edge. The stem is long by 1.5‚Äì2.5 mm thick, and equal in width throughout its length. It is attached to its substrate (wood or sticks) by a grayish mat of mycelium. It is not known if the mushroom contains psychoactive compounds like psilocybin or psilocin. The spore print is purple-brown. The spores are ellipsoid to slightly egg- shaped, smooth, and measure 6.3‚Äì7.5 by 3.8‚Äì4.5 Œºm. The spores have an apical pore, but it is small and inconspicuous. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, narrowly club-shaped to somewhat cylindrical, and measure 18‚Äì24 by 5‚Äì6 Œºm. P. washingtonensis has scattered to abundant pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) that typically measure 38‚Äì56 by 9‚Äì12 Œºm. There are two forms of cheilocystidia (cystidia in the gill edge): one is fusoid- ventricose (distinctly enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with blunt to somewhat sharp apices, often covered with mucilage, and measures 26‚Äì38 by 7‚Äì11 Œºm; the other is broadly club-shaped to capitate (with a distinct spherical tip), and measures 26 by 10‚Äì12 Œºm. =Similar species= Other than differences in spore color, P. washingtonensis is similar in appearance to Kuehneromyces vernalis. Stamets has noted a resemblance to Hypholoma udum and H. dispersum. P. washingtonensis may be distinguished from P. pelliculosa by the presence of pleurocystidia. Habitat and distribution Psilocybe washingtonensis grows scattered or in groups on decaying conifer wood in forests. The species is only known from Washington state and from northern Oregon, near Welches.

While in school she played for the girls' basketball team. When Love was a sophomore in high school she was determined to build up her endurance for basketball and decided to pick up boxing as a cross-training tool. The gym she began training at was Ring Sports United, owned by four time boxing/kickboxing world champion Kim Messer who began mentoring Love, which is when she says she fell in love with the sport. Before Love took on boxing as a full-time endeavor she worked for the City of Bellevue's Parks and Recreation Department coaching youth sports. She was also attending college where her interest was focused on a possible degree in Criminal Justice. Her other passions include playing guitar and hiking. Love received the silver medal at the Golden Gloves, her first championship fight. In 2010, she defeated the Polish World champion Karolina Michalczuk. It was her closest fight ever, 17-16. She has also been the recipient of the outstanding athlete award at the Woman's International Dual.

Set in Belfast during the Second World War, it tells the story of 17-year-old Gavin Burke who, admitting ‚ÄúWar was freedom, freedom from futures,‚Äù defies his Nationalist and Catholic family by volunteering as an air raid warden with the largely Protestant ARP. The novel takes you through Gavin's journey as he realises that there are those on the other side of the city's bitter communal division whose friendships offer a wider horizon. Based in part on Moore's own wartime experiences, he described it as the most autobiographical of his novels. Moore left Belfast in 1943 to join the British Ministry of War Transport and worked himself for a period with the ARP in London. The book is dedicated, as were all of Moore's subsequent novels, to his partner Jean, who became his second wife two years after its publication. Its title is taken from Wallace Stevens' poem \\"The Emperor of Ice-Cream\\". The book was dramatised by the Northern Irish actor, playwright and theatre director Bill Morrison; the play was performed at Dublin's Abbey Theatre in 1977.

It was found around 1915 in a gravel bed on the left bank of the Waal river, near the Dutch city of Nijmegen. The helmet would have been worn by the √©lite Roman cavalry. The head portion of the helmet is made of iron, while the mask and diadem are of bronze or brass. The helmet has a neck- protecting projecting rim, overlaid with a thin bronze covering plated with silver. The diadem features two male and three female figures. The helmet sustained oxidisation. Several other Roman sports helmets have also been found in or near Nijmegen. Description The remaining portions of the helmet consist of three main parts: a head-piece with face mask, a brow band, and ear and neck guards on either side. It would have originally had an iron skull cap, of which only fragments remain. The head-piece, made of silvered bronze, depicts a youthful face. The eyes, mouth, and nostrils have openings, and the lips and eyelids are gilded. The face extends outwards on the sides to cover the ears. These are covered by a separate piece of silvered bronze to protect the ears and neck. On the dexter cheek is scratched a name, suggested to be \\"Marcianus\\". The brow band, or diadem, of the helmet is attached to the head- piece by a single horizontal hinge; additional straps would likely have originally been used to hold the helmet in place over the wearer's head. At the top and bottom of the brow band are beaded lines, between which five raised busts, three female and two male, are depicted. The band is silvered, and the beaded lines, like the busts' drapery, lips, eyelids, and hair, are gilded. Discovery The helmet was discovered in a gravel bed on the south bank of the Waal, under a railway bridge and below the Dutch city Nijmegen. Inside it were found two cheek guards, evidently from a separate helmet, and several melon-shaped blue glass beads. It was published in 1915 and described as \\"a recent addition\\" to the collection of Roman antiquities of Gerard Marius Kam, also of Nijmegen. Kam displayed the helmet in the self-built Kam Museum (nl), opened in 1922, which he donated to the government; the museum closed in 1998 to merge with the Commanderie van St. Jan (nl) museum and form the Valkhof Museum, where the helmet is now displayed. In 2011 the helmet was displayed in England, at the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery in Carlisle Cumbria, marking the first time it had been exhibited in the United Kingdom and only the second time outside the Netherlands. The Tullie House Museum had the year before raised ¬£1.97 million in an attempt to acquire the Crosby Garrett helmet at auction, but was outbid; the helmet was purchased by a private individual for ¬£2,330,468.75. Typology The Nijmegen helmet dates to the first century AD, or early second century, as indicated by its hairless brow and the shape of its eyes, lips, and chin. It is broadly classified as a cavalry sports helmet‚Äîtype D, according to the typology put forward by H. Russell Robinson. Type D cavalry sports helmets are distinguished by two features: a horizontal hinge that attaches the face mask to the head piece, and a head piece made to resemble a decorated helmet.

Tao avoided sentimentality, his concentration drawing us into the composer's spare and witty work as few virtuosos of any age can do.\\" Of his 2012 performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, Catherine Reese Newton of The Salt Lake Tribune commented: \\"Not only did Tao demonstrate prodigious technique and a decisive attack in the ... outer movements of the concerto, he showed reflective musicianship in the slow movement. [His] encore [was] a dazzling performance of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6.\\" Of Tao's Prokofiev Piano Sonata No. 7, Justin Davidson wrote in New York Magazine: \\"No 17-year-old should be able to do justice to one of the most bleakly adult pieces in the literature, yet he played it with aggressive charm and flashes of genuine wisdom.\\" Lawrence Johnson of The Detroit News reviewed Tao's performance the same year of Saint- Sa√´ns' Piano Concerto No. 2: At the 2012 Aspen Music Festival, Tao \\"delivered the most arresting performance, attacking [Gershwin's] Second Rhapsody with a lethal combination of power, rhythmic thrust, technical perfection and sheer joy.\\" The following year, on less than three days' notice to replace an ailing pianist, Tao played Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 \\"with insouciant ease and apparent enjoyment ... flair and musicality\\".Miller, Sarah Bryan. \\"Pianist Conrad Tao dazzles in early SLSO debut\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 2, 2013 Of Tao's performance of all five of Beethoven's piano concerti that year, David Fleshler commented in South Florida Classical Review: \\"The mastery he displayed was more than the predictable brilliance of the grown-up prodigy, it was a performance that brought out the nobility, the eloquence and the dramatic power of these works.\\"Fleshler, David. \\"Pianist Tao, 18, shows deep and mature artistry in Beethoven\\", South Florida Classical Review, April 16, 2013 Larry Lapidus of The Spokesman-Review called the five concerti \\"a richly rewarding ‚Äì indeed, unforgettable ‚Äì musical experience\\" noting, that \\"Tao played the lengthy and difficult Concerto No. 1 ... without a flaw: not a missed or imperfectly struck note, not a careless or routine phrase, not a poorly voiced chord.\\" Richard Todd of the Ottawa Citizen termed Tao's Piano Concerto No. 19 by Mozart, with National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, Canada, \\"almost startling in its clarity of sound and purpose.\\" =2014‚Äìpresent= In 2014, Matt Dixon wrote of Tao's Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3: \\"The level of precision on display was beyond impressive, and the closing minutes of the third and final movement revealed an energy that was simply exhilarating. Tao's ... approach to the music itself was dynamic, unusually expressive, and engaging, with the technical mastery always serving to aid in the interpretation.\\" Margared Sandresky of the Winston-Salem Journal commented of his Rachmaninoff Rhapsody: \\"Tao ... realized with ease both the prodigious technical difficulties and the many varied expressive demands of the piece, leading the orchestra players on a merry chase as the difficult passage work streamed from his fingers like mercury.\\" Scott Smith of The Baltimore Sun stated of his performance of Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 1 that Tao possesses \\"an ability to communicate clearly, no matter how thorny a score may become ... Tao brought remarkable spontaneity and colorful phrasing. ... There was always musicality, not just virtuosity\\". Of his Rachmaninoff Rhapsody, Gregory Sullivan Isaacs of TheaterJones judged that Tao \\"displayed impeccable technique ... clean and crystal clear, bordering on brittle. Some warmth throughout, not just in the lush melodic parts, would have been welcome. ... This is not to say that his performance lacked nuance, because there were many lovely turns of phrases. However, it left the impression that he was impatient to get through the slow parts and back to the flights of virtuosity. ... But there is no denying Tao's brilliance and technical mastery. All of the above reservations about the performance are the sins of the young.\\" In the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 21 in 2015, according to Matt Palm of the Orlando Sentinel, \\"Tao's energetic work blended seamlessly with his fellow musicians to create both elegance and exuberance.\\" Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News called Tao's Aaron Copland piano sonata \\"gripping ... finely timed and layered, but the rhythmic quirks of the scherzo would have been set in higher relief at a marginally slower pace\\", and thought of his Rachmaninoff √âtudes-Tableaux, Op. 39 that \\"the F-sharp minor felt a bit pressed, and the D minor was pushed and pulled about too much. The A minor ... was ravishing, though, and the D major was genuinely exciting\\". Steven Kruger of New York Arts wrote that Tao's \\"was the best performance of the Rachmaninoff Paganini Variations I have ever heard, on or off disc. Tao was so vivid, he might as well have been Gershwin at the keyboard. Every note was electric. And the last movement of the Prokofiev Seventh Sonata, offered as an encore, simply made everyone's jaw drop.\\" Peter Dobrin of Philly.com wrote that, in Saint-Sa√´ns' Piano Concerto No. 2, Tao \\"kept his monstrous technique on a leash [and] used it for sincerity and wit ‚Äì waiting a split second in certain entrances for a flash of humor, or holding back for emphasis. The opening was moving, and the way he paced mounting intensity in the last minutes uncovered the best in this work\\". In a performance of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in 2016, John Shulson of The Virginia Gazette commented that Tao's \\"performance ... was one of the most thrilling to be heard on stage with this symphony. ... Tao was the master of the Rachmaninoff and its many moods, offering inspired lyricism and ponderous power.\\" John Pitcher of Nashville Scene wrote that, in the Grieg, Tao \\"emphasized the concerto‚Äôs showy side [but] there was more ... than mere razzle-dazzle. He was an imaginative tonal colorist who used the piano‚Äôs sustain pedal to create a wash of prismatic overtones.\\" He also commented, of Tao's encore, Carter's \\"fiendishly difficult, cerebral\\" piece, \\"Cat√©naires\\", that \\"the audience listened with breathless excitement. In the end, they roared their approval, giving Tao a sustained ovation.\\" In the Ottawa Citizen, Natasha Gauthier judged that Tao \\"brought an original, modernist sensibility\\" to the Schumann Concerto and Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. She noted: > Tao has a trick of subtly emphasizing bass lines and syncopations in a way > that sounds fresh yet organic, never forced or overblown. He has huge > technique and facility, but it's his relaxed, almost jazzy approach to the > music that stood out. The Schumann was all restless energy and shifting, > interior light. The Beethoven had a lively, prancing magnificence, vivid as > a film. An encore of \\"Cat√©naires\\" ... had both meticulous control and lethal > attack. Of Tao's performance of Schumann's piano concerto with the Pacific Symphony, Ken Iisaka of San Francisco Classical Voice commented: \\"With clear, articulate lines, Robert Schumann's passionate ardor towards Clara was expressed with determination, through deliberate tempos. Rather than letting the music be overly sentimental, rendering it a torrent of rage, Tao illustrated its volatile, bipolar personality with an unusual level of clarity and dryness. It almost felt as if the music gave a third-person account of the composer, rather than the music being by Schumann himself. Tao‚Äôs fresh perspective laid strong emphasis on the music‚Äôs architecture.\\" Another reviewer thought that, in his rendition of Rhapsody in Blue, Tao \\"bent the rhythms at times, showing his mastery of jazz style without disturbing his rapport with the accompanying [Asheveille Symphony] orchestra. He found connections and bridges that I had been unaware of, observed pauses that emphasized the importance of silence in the midst of music, and generally convinced the audience that this was a performance to remember.\\" Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times reviewed one of Tao's \\"Crypt Sessions\\" recitals at the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, New York (Tao substituted on two days' notice for an ailing David Greilsammer), writing: > In the crypt, the sheer volume of Mr. Tao's sound during frenzied climaxes > [of Frederic Rzewski's \\"Which Side Are You On?\\"] was near-deafening, yet > exhilarating. ... It was fascinating, though, to hear Mr. Tao draw out every > dissonance-statured, vehement element of [Copland's piano] sonata while also > bringing affecting tranquillity to the pensive conclusion of the last > movement.\\"Tommasini, Anthony. \\"Review: A Pianist Brings American Rage to a > Church Crypt\\", The New York Times, April 7, 2017 Of his 2018 performance of Gershwin's Concerto in F with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Mary Kunz Goldman wrote: \\"Tao has a fine percussive touch. He hammers away at the piece with flawless staccato energy. ... The end of the first movement was so tumultuous and perfectly calibrated that the crowd burst into illicit applause. The Andante movement had a bluesy, bittersweet quality. The concluding Allegro brought Tao back to attack mode. ... The snap-bang ending brought the listeners to their feet ... happy and shouting.\\" Mark Gresham, writing in ArtsATL called Tao's performance of Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 1 \\"brilliantly virtuosic\\", and he joined the critics who have particularly remarked upon Tao's playing of his encore, \\"Cat√©naires\\", calling it \\"perhaps the most adventurous encore to be heard on the ASO stage in a long, long time. ... It was by far the ear-opener of the evening.\\" Reviewing Tao's 2019 debut with Cleveland Orchestra, Zachary Lewis commented: \\"Technique? Tao had it in spades. He [found] warmth, nuance, and haunting expression where many see little more than virtuoso display. [Besides] a ferocious but still sparkling third movement ... the highlight was the Andantino. ... Tao ably guided his listeners through the eerie, twisted thicket that is a set of variations, conversing gently with his colleagues all the way.

Phoenix and Natalya first began teaming together when the latter was Divas Champion and was feuding with LayCool in late September 2010. In August 2011, both women turned villainous and developed the character of anti-Divas, who were violently opposed to the acceptance of \\"cute\\", \\"perky\\", \\"Barbie doll\\" women in the company. Their slogan of \\"Pin-Up Strong\\" was also the name of their submission maneuver. Phoenix retired from wrestling in 2012, but came out of retirement in 2019 to reform her tag team with Natalya, now referring to themselves as simply \\"Beth Phoenix and Natalya\\", and challenge for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 35.  History  = Original run (2010‚Äì2012) = In late 2010, following the split of Natalya's stable The Hart Dynasty, Natalya set her sights on LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) and the Divas Championship. After coming up short twice due to LayCool's machinations, Natalya finally defeated the duo in a handicap match for the Divas Championship at Survivor Series. She was attacked after the match by LayCool, but Beth Phoenix, returning from an injury she'd suffered in May which was credited to LayCool, made the save and then congratulated Natalya. From there, the two formed an alliance against LayCool, and at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in December, Phoenix and Natalya defeated Lay-Cool in the first Divas tag team tables match in WWE history. The alliance quietly ended a month later when Natayla lost the Divas Championship to Eve Torres at Royal Rumble, and went back to competing exclusively on the Raw brand. On the August 1, 2011, episode of Raw, both women competed in a battle royal to determinate who would receive a Divas Championship match against Kelly Kelly at SummerSlam. Phoenix won the match, then turned villainous by attacking Kelly, and stated \\"[her] days as the perky, cute, blonde little bimbo are officially over.\\" Four days later on SmackDown, Natalya defeated her prot√©g√© AJ Lee, and afterwards attacked AJ before pledging an alliance Phoenix, telling her that she agreed with her in that \\"the days of the cute perky little princesses are over\\". Phoenix and Natalya officially debuted together as \\"The Divas of Doom\\" on the August 12 episode of SmackDown, defeating AJ Lee and Kaitlyn, who they continued to assault after the match. Natalya then accompanied Phoenix to her Divas Championship match at SummerSlam against Kelly Kelly, who was accompanied by Eve Torres, but she failed to win the match. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Phoenix defeated Eve Torres to earn another title shot at Night of Champions, where she again lost. On the September 19 episode of Raw, the Divas of Doom lost a tag team match to Kelly Kelly and Eve Torres after Eve pinned Natalya for the win. On the September 26 episode of Raw, Phoenix pinned Kelly Kelly in a tag team match to earn another title shot at Hell in a Cell. On the September 30 edition of SmackDown, Natalya lost a match to Kelly. Following the match, Phoenix jumped into the ring and delivered a Glam Slam to Kelly, then Natalya applied their new submission, Pin-Up Strong, making Kelly Kelly scream and cry in pain. At Hell in a Cell, Phoenix defeated Kelly Kelly with help from Natalya, winning her first Divas Championship. At Vengeance, Phoenix defeated Eve to retain the Divas Championship. At Survivor Series, Natalya accompanied Phoenix to a successful lumberjill Divas Championship match against Eve Torres. On January 29, 2012 at Royal Rumble, the Divas of Doom competed in an eight-woman tag team match alongside The Bella Twins, and defeated the team of Eve Torres, Kelly Kelly, Alicia Fox, and Tamina. The next night on the January 30 episode of Raw, Phoenix successfully defended her Divas Championship against Eve. At Elimination Chamber, Phoenix successfully defended her championship against Tamina. On the March 22 episode of Superstars, Phoenix and Natalya appeared on opposite sides of a tag team match in which Phoenix teamed with Eve Torres against Natalya and Tamina, with Phoenix's team winning the match. Afterwards, Phoenix and Natalya would not team up again until the July 12 episode of Superstars, where there were defeated by Alicia Fox and Kaitlyn. At Money in the Bank, they teamed up with Torres, being defeated by Layla, Kaitlyn and Tamina. On the September 28 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix and Natalya faced each other in a match, in which Phoenix came out victorious. After the match they both shook hands, but Torres, who in-storyline was by then was in a position of authority, appeared to suspend Phoenix accusing her of being the mysterious attacker of Kaitlyn, since the attacker was blonde. Phoenix in turn accused Natalya, saying that she was also blonde, and Phoenix and Natalya ended up arguing in the ring. Soon afterwards, Phoenix left WWE. = Reunion (2019‚Äìpresent) = The Divas of Doom in May 2019 The team had a brief reunion when Natalya inducted Phoenix into the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame, and again at the 2018 Royal Rumble, where Natalya eliminated Phoenix in the first ever 30-woman Royal Rumble match. On March 10, 2019 at Fastlane, Phoenix was attacked by Tamina and Nia Jax, after which Natalya came to defend her, but also ended up being attacked by the duo. On the March 18, 2019 episode of Raw, Phoenix announced that she was coming out of retirement; she and Natalya reformed their team and challenged The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 35; however, later that night Tamina and Jax once again ambushed Phoenix after a distraction from Jax during a one-on-one match between Natalya and Banks. On the March 25, 2019, episode of Raw, it was announced that Phoenix and Natalya would compete in a fatal four-way match at WrestleMania 35 against The Boss 'n' Hug Connection, Jax and Tamina, and The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), but they did not manage to win at the event, being the latter team the winners. The Divas of Doom doing matching sharpshooters on Liv Morgan and Ruby Riott Natalya and Phoenix did the 2019 Raw European Tour together as their tag, The Divas of Doom. The pair went against The Riott's Squad, Ruby Riott and Liv Morgan. They won all of their matches and usually ended them with matching sharpshooters. The pair reunited once again at the 2020 Women's Royal Rumble, which saw Phoenix enter at #19 while Natalya entered at #23. Both women reached the final four, after which Phoenix eliminated Natalya before she was eliminated herself by Shayna Baszler.

This field promises to open up whole new chapters relating to human genetic and cultural development, including cuisine, medical practice, architecture and other crafts over the past 4 million years and more. Investigations of ancient dyes, foods, beverages, and other organics First came the chemical attestation of the earliest Royal or Tyrian Purple, the famous dye of the seafaring Phoenicians, demonstrating that ancient organic compounds (specifically, 6,6'-dibromoindigotin) could survive over 3000 years.P.E.

Amphora and vat sherds with purple residues on their interiors were recovered by a Penn Museum team at Sarepta (Sarafand) along the coast of Lebanon, the first homeland site in Phoenicia to be extensively excavated. Piles of molluscan shells of two of the three Mediterranean species (Murex trunculus and M. brandaris) yielding Purple, preferentially broken to extract the glands with the dye precursors, and kilns for heating the extracts, together with the chemical evidence, argued strongly that the sherds derived from an ancient Canaanite Purple dye factory. In the early 1990s, the laboratory identified the earliest chemically confirmed instances of grape wine and barley beer from the Near East, viz., from Godin Tepe in Iran, ca. 3400-3000 B.C.R.H.

Research at the start of the new millennium focused on the Neolithic period of ancient China's Yellow River valley. At the site of Jiahu, the laboratory discovered the earliest alcoholic beverage in the world dating back to about ca. 7000-6600 B.C.P.E. McGovern, J. Zhang, J. Tang, Z. Zhang, G.R. Hall, R.A.

McGovern, 2007. Chemical and Archaeological Evidence for the Earliest Cacao Beverages.

The fruit's sweet pulp contains about 15% sugar, which naturally ferments to a 5 to 7% alcoholic beverage. This beverage might have led to the domestication of the tree. In later Mayan and Aztec times, the chocolate beverage was made from the beans (seeds) with additives including honey, chili peppers, fragrant flowers, etc. Like grape wine, rice wine, and barley beer in the Old World, chocolate \\"wine\\" went on to become the prerogative of royalty and the elite generally, and a focus of religion in the New World. No additives were detected in the early Puerto Escondido vessels, so it is likely that the chocolate beverage then was made only from the pulp. Archaeological Oncology The laboratory has embarked on a recent initiative (\\"Archaeological Oncology: Digging for Drug Discovery\\") to discover herbal and tree resin compounds in ancient alcoholic beverages that have anti-cancer and other medicinal properties. Alcohol readily dissolves organic compounds in botanicals, and provides a ready means to administer them by drinking or applying to the skin. Ancient humans had a huge incentive in trying to find any cure they could, and over millennia might well have discovered empirical solutions, even if they couldn't explain them scientifically. Superstition might well creep in, but in certain periods, like the Neolithic, humans were remarkably innovative in the domestication and probably the discovery of medicinal plants. They have been lost to us when the cultures collapsed and disappeared, but can now be rediscovered using Biomolecular Archaeology. Archaeological Oncology can help speed up the drug discovery process and recover some of these lost remedies. For example, a biomolecular archaeological study of a liquid contained inside a tightly lidded Shang Dynasty bronze vessel, dated to ca. 1050 B.C., indicated that a Chinese wormwood/mugwort species (Artemisia annua and/or Artemisia argyi) had been dissolved into a rice wine.P.E. McGovern, M. Christofidou-Solomidou, W. Wang, F. Dukes, T. Davidson, and W.S. El-Deiry 2010. Anticancer activity of botanical compounds in ancient fermented beverages (Review). International Journal of Oncology 37: 5-14. http://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/wp- content/uploads/2010/03/InterJOncologyarticle3.pdf In vitro studies of the active medicinal compound in the plant‚Äîartemisinin or its synthetic derivative artesunate‚Äîhave been shown to be remarkably effective against a whole range of cancers, including Lewis lung carcinoma, colon cancer (adenocarcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma (connective tissue), uveal melanoma, hepatoma, ascitic liver tumor, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, neuroblastoma, and myeloid leukemia. Analyses of some of the earliest wine from the tomb of Scorpion I at Abydos, Egypt Ancient Egypt, dated to ca. 3150 B.C., has revealed the presence of a host of herbal additives, including herbs‚Äîsavory (Satureja), Artemisia seibeni (a member of the wormwood family), blue tansy (Tanacetum annuum), balm (Melissa), senna (Cassia), coriander (Coriandrum), germander (Teucrium), mint (Mentha), sage (Salvia), and/or thyme (Thymus/Thymbra).P.E.

The gala re-creation of the feast was at the Penn Museum in 2000; other dinners have been held in California, Michigan, and Washington, D.C. A re-creation at the tomb itself was filmed for a Channel 4 special in Britain‚Äìthe beverage, made by the Kavaklidere winery, was served in and drunk from re-created vessels, and local villagers from Polatli prepared the stew by grinding the lentils in basalt mortars and barbecued the meat on open-fire spits. McGovern took his scientific study of ancient alcoholic beverages one step further by re- creating them, both to learn more about how ancient humans accomplished what they did and to bring the past alive. His collaboration with Dogfish Head Brewery led to the commercial version of Midas Touch, the brewery's most awarded brew in major tasting competitions, Chateau Jiahu (based on the earliest alcoholic beverage from China), and Theobroma (an interpretation of the ancient cacao beverage and named after the tree). Maize or corn chicha was a non-commercial experiment, following traditions of the ancient Inca empire, in which native Peruvian red maize was chewed to break the carbohydrates down into sugars; pepperberries and strawberries were also added. A re-creation of an ancient Egyptian brew (Ta-Henket = ancient Egyptian \\"bread-beer\\"), which is based on archaeobotanical and Biomolecular Archaeological evidence dating between ca. 16,000 and 3150 B.C., was released in early December 2011. =Publications= McGovern is well known for his book on Ancient Wine: The Search for the Origins of Viniculture (Princeton University, 2003/2006),P.E.

He ran only six times in a career which was restricted by chronic injury problems. He was the outstanding British colt of his generation, winning The Derby and the St James's Palace Stakes in 1922. He retired after winning his only race as a four-year-old in 1923. Background Captain Cuttle, an exceptionally good- looking chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and three white socks, was bred by his owner Lord Woolavington. He was from the first crop of foals sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making him a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Apart from Captain Cuttle, Hurry On sired the winners of seven Classics including the Derby winners Coronach and Call Boy. His most influential son was the Ascot Gold Cup winner Precipitation, who sired four classic winners. Captain Cuttle was named after the character in Dickens' novel Dombey and Son. Like his sire, Captain Cuttle was trained throughout his career by Fred Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire, and was ridden in his most important races by the leading British jockey of the era Steve Donoghue. The colt was particularly devoted to his trainer, following him \\"like a pet dog.\\" Racing career =1921: two-year-old season= Captain Cuttle was a slow-maturing colt and was not highly tried at two. He made only one appearance on the racecourse, finishing second in a minor race at Doncaster. Captain Cuttle's heavy physique and immaturity put a strain on his forelegs, leading Darling to treat him very carefully, riding the colt himself in most of his exercise work. =1922: three-year-old season= Captain Cuttle began his three-year-old season in the Wood Ditton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, which he won by six lengths. He became ill after the race and had not fully recovered by the time he ran in the 2000 Guineas. He finished third in the Newmarket Classic, beaten a total of seven lengths, behind St Louis and Pondoland. There were doubts concerning the colt's stamina, and he started at odds of 10/1 in a field of thirty for the Epsom Derby four weeks later. Captain Cuttle missed the parade for the Derby after a delay caused by a shoeing accident. Allegations were later made in the Daily Express that Captain Cuttle had been illegally injected with cocaine, to combat lameness caused by the incident. Lord Woolavington responded by instituting legal proceedings against the newspaper for libel. Ridden by Donoghue, Captain Cuttle was prominent from the start before moving into the lead entering the straight. He was soon clear and won easily by four lengths from Tamar in a race record time of 2:34.6. The colt was reported to be lame after the race and there were rumours that his career was over but he appeared to have recovered in time for Royal Ascot where he won the St James's Palace Stakes over a mile. He then suffered a tendon injury which forced him out for the rest of the season. =1923: four-year-old season= On his 1923 debut, Captain Cuttle won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Kempton. He was being prepared for the Ascot Gold Cup when his tendon problems recurred and he was retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Captain Cuttle the seventy-third best British horse of the 20th Century and the second best Derby winner of the 1920s .Randall, J and Morris, T. . Portway Press, 1999, p. 128 Stud career Captain Cuttle retired to his owner's stud at Lavington, West Sussex. He had some success, siring the 1000 Guineas winner Scuttle but did not live up to expectations and was sold for a reported ¬£40,000 to stand in Italy in 1927. He died at the Mirafiori stud, near Turin in 1932 after breaking his back in a freak accident. Pedigree Name The name \\"Captain Cuttle\\" was taken from a character in Dombey and Son by Charles Dickens, Captain Edward Cuttle. It was subsequently applied to an LNER Class A3 locomotive, No. 2745 (BR number 60091), many of which class were named for racehorses.

Established in 1957, the award is presented annually, with winners selected by the readers of Bravo magazine. The award is presented in gold, silver and bronze and, since 1996, an honorary platinum statuette presented for lifetime achievement. The award was originally presented only to actors, however, in 1960, additional categories were created to recognize musical artists. Over time, various categories have been expanded while other categories have been merged or phased out altogether. As of 2011, the Bravo Otto is presented in a total of 11 competitive categories; Male Film Star, Female Film Star, Male TV Star, Female TV Star, Male Super Singer, Female Super Singer, Super Rapper, Super Rock Band, Super Pop Band, Comedy Star and Internet Star. From 1957 to 1972, The Bravo Otto award ceremony was presented at the beginning of each year. Beginning in 1972, the date of the ceremony was moved to the end of the year, resulting in the awards being presented twice for the 1972 calendar year. Since 1994, the ceremony has been presented in a one-hour annual show called Der Bravo-Supershow ‚Äì Die Gold-Otto-Verleihung (roughly translated as The Bravo-Supershow - The Gold Otto Awards) and is broadcast annually on German television. The Otto awards are also presented in other European countries where Bravo publishes regional versions of the magazine. The most notable of these countries include Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland. In Hungary, the awards are presented in an annual ceremony which is broadcast on television, similar to the German ceremony.

CMAL is a wholly owned public corporation of the Scottish Government, with Scottish Ministers as sole shareholders. History Until 1 October 2006 Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, which was wholly owned by the Scottish government, provided the majority of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and owned the associated vessels and a number of the ports and harbour facilities that the vessels used. These services required an annual revenue deficit grant from the then Scottish Executive to maintain lifeline service levels. To comply with European guidelines on State Aids in Maritime Transport, an open public tender was deemed necessary in respect of these ferry services and the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services (CHFS) was tendered as a single bundle, with the exception of the Gourock-Dunoon service. In recognition of the uniqueness of the fleet and to ensure a level playing field for all bidders, on 1 October 2006 Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd was split into: * An asset-owning company, Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL). * A new operating company, CalMac Ferries Ltd (CFL). This was done by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd transferring its operations - but not its assets - to CFL. The operation of the lifeline ferry service was then put out to open competitive tender. CMAL now owns all vessels, the majority of land based assets (ports, harbours etc.) and the Caledonian MacBrayne brand, and makes them available to an operator through an open tendering process. CFL continues to operate the services after winning the tendering process and holds the Public Services Contract (PSC) until 30 September 2013. Under the terms of the tender CFL is bound to use the vessels of CMAL. Business CMAL's responsibilities include: * Maintaining, improving and enhancing assets such as vessels and the land and property around piers and harbours * Seeking extra investment to invest in ferries and harbour facilities * Working with stakeholders within Scotland and the wider maritime community to be acknowledged as the principal provider of the most cost-effective, innovative ferries and port infrastructure to the benefit of local communities Ferries Finlaggan passing the Paps of Jura, May 2011 CMAL currently owns 36 ferries, of which 33 are operated by Calmac Ferries on routes to the islands and peninsulas of the west of Scotland. In April 2018 it was agreed that the three vessels operated by NorthLink Ferries on routes to the Orkney and Shetland islands would also joint the fleet. A further two vessel are chartered, also for use on the Northlink routes, where they serve as freight transporters. Many ferries are specially built for the ports they serve yet are still interchangeable and able to serve different crossings and can carry from one to 143 cars. The total fleet value was estimated at ¬£130m in 2017. and ceased operation with Caledonian MacBrayne in early 2018, and are now no longer part of the fleet. =Hebridean and Clyde ferries (Caledonian MacBrayne)= =Northern Isles ferries (NorthLink Ferries)= Harbours Port Ellen pier on Islay was officially opened by CMAL in August 2012 CMAL is Harbour Authority at 24 locations across Scotland and owns the associated port infrastructure and properties at each of these locations. Additionally, CMAL owns and leases a number of properties at various locations associated with the delivery of Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services. As Statutory Harbour Authority for a number of these harbours, CMAL's responsibilities and duties include: * A duty of care to all port users * An obligation to conserve and promote the safe use of the harbours * Responsibility for efficiency, economy and safety of operation, in respect of the services and facilities provided Current Projects Launch of Hallaig Hybrid Ferry in December 2012 Hybrid ferries project - On 17 December 2012, the world's first seagoing roll-on roll-off vehicle and passenger diesel-electric hybrid ferry was launched by CMAL on the Clyde. incorporates a low-carbon hybrid system of diesel electric and lithium ion battery power. The 135-tonne ferry is nearly 150 ft long and can accommodate 150 passengers, 23 cars or two heavy goods vehicles. She came into service between Skye and Raasay in the summer of 2013. A second hybrid ferry was launched in May 2013 and operates on the Tarbert-Portavadie route. A third, to be named was launched in spring 2016. In September 2015, it was announced that CMAL would order two 'dual-fuel ferries' from Ferguson Marine Engineering (FMEL). The vessels will be able to operate on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and marine diesel, future-proofing them for tighter sulphur emissions regulations. They will be the largest commercial vessels to be built on the Clyde since 2001. The first, named , was due to enter service at Ardrossan in 2018, with the second yet to be named by online vote following a few months later. Both vessels have been delayed, with the shipyard going into administration in August 2019. Sustainable ferries study - CMAL has been commissioned to carry out a feasibility study for Scottish Enterprise that will evaluate the technical and commercial possibilities of using hydrogen fuel cells to enable the development of zero emission ferries. Brodick Terminal Redevelopment - CMAL completed the redevelopment of Brodick ferry terminal. The redevelopment included an entirely new pier with linkspan and airbridge, a second berth with concrete ramp, a new two-storey terminal building with bus station and car marshalling space. The old linkspan was removed and the causeway transformed into an outdoor seating area. Footnotes References * Clyde Pleasure Steamers - Ian McCrorie, Orr, Pollock & Co.

Description Corosaurus is known from the holotype UW 5485, a partial skeleton which includes the skull. Later, the referred specimens YPM 41030-41068, FMNH PR 135, FMNH PR 1368-1369, FMNH PR 242-246 and FMNH PR 1382-1383 were described by Glenn William Storrs in 1991. All specimens were collected in Jackson Canyon, Natrona County, from the Chugwater Group of the Alcova Limestone Formation, dating to the late Olenekian stage of the late Early Triassic, about 247.4-245 million years ago. After a revision of the holotype and referred material of Corosaurus, Olivier Rieppel found Corosaurus to be the sister-taxon to a clade comprising Cymatosaurus, Pistosaurus and Plesiosauria. Etymology Corosaurus was first named by Ermine Cowles Case in 1936 and the type species is Corosaurus alcovensis. The specific name is derived from the name of the Alcova Limestone Formation, in which the holotype was found. Corosaurus was placed in its own family, Corosauridae, which named by Oskar Kuhn, in 1961.

La Milpa is located between the sites of Rio Azul and Lamanai. Currently, La Milpa lies within the nature preserve owned by the Programme for Belize, a non-profit organization.Norman Hammond, 1991 PfB acquired land for the preserve from the Coco-Cola Company, who purchased land in Belize in 1988 with the goals of tearing down the rainforest to create a citrus plantation, however donated the land to conservation and management project in 1990 and 1992. Following Caracol and Lamanai, La Milpa is the third largest site in Belize with the Main Plaza alone covering 18,000 square meters, making it one of the largest in the entire Maya region.  Research History  This site was first discovered in March 1938 by Sir J. Eric S. Thompson.Norman Hammond 2001Norman Hammond et al. 1998 Thompson‚Äôs work at La Milpa entailed mapping and excavating the Main Center, recording a total of 12 different stelae. Thompson noted that there was a line of stelae along the Great Plaza, however they were badly weathered. These stelae were made of a soft limestone that came from the bedrock within the PfB area. According to Nikolai Grube, the composition of this material accounted for why the stelae were so eroded.Nikolai Grube 1994Nikolai Grube 1998 Nonetheless, Thompson was able read a date on Stela 7 of 9.17.10.0.0. (November 30, 780).Norman Hammond 2001Norman Hammond et al. 1998Norman Hammond, 1991 Thompson‚Äôs work was short lived at La Milpa however, due a bout of dysentery that cut his season short. After Thompson, La Milpa was not explored again until the 1970s, when David M. Pendergast and Stanley Loten conducted a field project at the site. Their work largely centered on adding to the existing map of the main plaza. After Pendergast and Loten, two archaeologists in 1979 from the Department of Archaeology in Belmopan went to La Milpa to confirm reports of looting.Norman Hammond,1991Norman Hammond et al., 1998 Their surveys confirmed that the site had been heavily looted. In 1985, the Department of Archaeology revisited La Milpa again because of reports of looting and additionally due to the speculation of the presence of marijuana fields. On this expedition, they confirmed both reports, noting that all the main structures within the site center had large trenches revealing older constructions and/or tombs. Archaeological research continued at La Milpa in 1988 when two different groups each with different objectives started investigations. The first group, The Rio Bravo Project, went to sketch the site center. The second group, the PfB, went to research the site for the potential ability to contribute to the archaeological record.Norman Hammond et al.,1998Kerry Sagebeil,2005Norman Hammond et al., 1996 The mapping done during these investigations showed the Main Plaza, the outlying courtyards and the location of stelae, as well as the trenches from looting. Thomas Guderjan, who was part of the original exploration by the Rio Bravo Project, returned in February 1990 to continue mapping the site and the outlying areas. Within this field season, Guderjan produced maps of four plazas, 20 residential courtyards, and 85 structures. While all these occur within a 1 km by .5 km area, Guderjan inferred that site could have had as many as 24 to 30 different courtyards. Guderjan also renumbered the stelae, however LaMAP and other scholars have since utilized Thompson‚Äôs original numbering.Kerry Sagebeil,2005Norman Hammond et al., 1996 In February 1992, Boston University and the La Milpa Archaeological Project (LaMAP) started extensive excavations and mapping of the site. = LaMAP = The first field season in 1992, under the direction of Dr. Norman Hammond and Dr. Gair Tourtellot, utilized multiple different fields of study including epigraphy, mapping, and excavations, to gain as much data as possible. The LaMAP project only holds a permit to excavate within a 6 km radius from the site center. Consequently, the excavations outside of this region were part of a different project directed by Dr. Richard E. W. Adams of the University of Texas at San Antonio and later by Dr. Fred Valdez of University of Texas at Austin, under the Programme for Belize Archaeological Project (PfBAP).Kerry Sagebeil,2005Norman Hammond,1991 Research within the first years was conducted at four main areas. The first being the La Milpa Center (LMC), second the three radiating radial transects from LMC, the third area consisting of four minor plazas, and finally, the fourth consisting of 15 random 250m by 250m survey blocks. Additional research has been research conducted by the Ancient Maya Land and Water Use Project, which has investigated the water drainage from the site center outwards.  Site Layout  The site is situated on a ridge roughly 1 km across, running from North to South, with the drainage going to the western side. There are no natural water sources within the site, however there are two large aguadas that would have held water through the dry season. While there are no other permanent water sources, in 1992 Vernon L. Scarborough investigated the possibility of two other reservoirs which were initially stone quarries thought to retain water. The site is structured with the Pet√©n-centric site plan, meaning a northern grouping of buildings surrounding the main plaza (Plaza A). This plaza is over 18,000 square meters and could have held upwards of 17,000 people. On the eastern side of this plaza are the construction of three large pyramid temples surrounding a fourth in the center in the middle of the plaza. The southern part of the plaza consists of a range of building while the northern part contains low walls that make up the northwest corner of the plaza. South of the Great Plaza, lies another group of buildings, which consist of three open plazas with enclosed courtyards. This area had only one pyramid and no stelae or altars. This area was not of interest until later in the project when research goals did include the southern region of the site center as well as the hinterlands that were within the 6 km radius from the center.  Site History  = Late Preclassic/ Early Classic 400 BC- AD 500 = During the Late Preclassic and Early Classic La Milpa was a small site located on a hilltop consisting of a few pyramids, one reservoir, and a few stelae. Excavations within Plaza A revealed a few monuments that date to this period indicating a growing population and therefore a need for increased space. The northern plaza was also occupied during this period. It was the foci of funerary monumental construction, which has led to the interpretation the dead were buried near the main population. The only other signs of occupation during this time can be seen in the alteration of the surrounding landscapes, such as construction of terraces. These changes may have occurred to do that advent of kingship and elite classes during the Late Preclassic.Kerry Sagebeil,2005 In addition, the archaeological record suggests that the Maya divinity controlled the population and therefore, the population was concentrated around the center monumental constructions. While these changes occurred fairly rapidly, the population and site stayed small and concentrated. During the Early Classic Period La Milpa saw significant growth in the production of monumental constructions the site center. The stelae also reflected change, indicating a shift towards political states with institutionalized royalty and a strong stable political system.Kerry Sagebeil,2005Norman Hammond et al. 1994Nikolai Grube 1994Nikolai Grube 1998 These changes reflect the growing political complexity as resource management became a tool of the state due to the increasing population density. In particular, power was negotiated by rulership through the ability to control the agriculture and the environment. Despite the growth of the site population and density during the Early Classic Period, La Milpa was able to sustain a large population; however, there is a marked pause in the culturalism of the Maya within this region during the Middle Classic Period. = Middle Classic AD 550 - 700 = The Middle Classic Period is marked by a decline in culture and populations within La Milpa and the other Three River sites. This change can be attributed to the population shift that occurred within the Three Rivers Basin due to the ongoing conflict between larger cities such as Tikal, Caracol, and Calakmul. The region saw a decline in both in populations and the controlling elite power. This ‚Äúcultural pausing‚Äù can be seen in the archaeological record due to the lack of new monumental constructions and elite artworks. Stelae dedications ended with the advent of the Middle Classic Period and did not resume until the Late Classic Period during a cultural revival. = Late/Terminal Classic 700‚Äì850 = At La Milpa during the mid-8th century, there was a steep upward climb in the construction of monumental architecture and the dedication of stelae. This increase in activity can be directly related to the change in settlement patterns outside of the site core. The Pet√©n-centric site plan became the site pattern for the main plaza of sites within the Three Rivers Basin. With this Pet√©n-centric site plan, there is a regrowth in populations and elite centers. Along with the change in site plan patterns, there is also the construction of two ballcourts within the site. These ballcourts were designed with a specific layout that would orient them from north to south and west to east. While there was a cultural revitalization and a burst in population, the revitalization only lasted for a short while.Kerry Sagebeil,2005K.C. Schultz 1994Norman Hammond et al. 1998Norman Hammond et al. 2004 Following the revitalization in the Late Classic Period, La Milpa and the surrounding sites experienced decline and eventually collapse along with the rest of the Maya realm. The collapse at La Milpa appears to have been rapid as indicated by the partial completion of monumental constructions along with other signs of sudden abandonment in the archaeological record. The site of La Milpa was occupied from the Pre-classic and Early Classic into the Late and Terminal Classic, reaching its peak during the Early Classic Period. La Milpa had intensive agriculture as indicated by extensive terraces. The site had a number of monumental constructions and other elite artworks, indicating centralized power. While the site has been subjected to numerous archaeological investigations, La Milpa remains largely unexplored.

Originally formed in Bristol, England, in 2002 by bass player Ed Grassby and featuring his brother and sister-in-law on guitars, the band started to gain momentum after Ed relocated to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire and recruited new guitarists Robert Walker and Simon Cardwell. The band played extensively around the UK for the next few years gaining a reputation for solid live performances; and intelligent and often witty lyrics.Sandman Magazine Issue 09 ‚Äì 5 DecemberKaleidoscope Magazine ‚Äì Issue 20 ‚Äì Winter 2005/6 The band's profile rose as they acquired support gigs with bands such as The Damned and NFD as well as playing with a number of bands who went on to form the base of the contemporary UK Goth Rock scene. A string of self-released EPs (Rat City, 2003, Attention Seeker, 2004, The Closing Time EP, 2006) led to their music being added to club and alternative radio playlists around the world. In July 2007, the band put out their first full album. Remembrance Day was released on CD and digital download through Resurrection Records. The album was well received gaining solid reviewsTWF magazine issue 9Hard-Wired Magazine 7 December which led to more club and radio play, bigger gigs and a support tour with NFD. The album featured a number of guest artists including female rock singer Mya and musician Ian Grinn, both of whom had originally met Rhombus at the band's first gig when Rhombus supported The Sisters of Murphy, a Sisters of Mercy tribute act. Shortly after the completion of the album, the band asked Mya to join full-time adding a well received extra dimension to the band's sound. At this time the band started to put more effort into their stage appearance and to take their business a little more seriously. In June 2009, Simon Cardwell quit the band. With a string of high-profile dates already booked, the band approached Ian Grinn to ask if he would step in as second guitarist so that the band could honour the bookings. After a positive reaction, Grinn was asked to join full-time. Grinn was better known as a punk, hard rock and folk singer-songwriter though he had been involved in gothic rock as a long serving member of The Sisters of Murphy. With the new line-up settled and a new rockier sound, the band set about writing and recording their second album. The addition of Mya and Grinn as both experienced songwriters and recording musicians to the fold allowed Ed and Rob, hitherto the creative force behind the band to raise their game further and the result was the album Open the Sky which the band completed recording at their own studio in October 2009. However, unhappy with the initial mastered mix, the band took the decision to stop the pressing and drafted in Stephen Carey of This Burning Effigy, Adoration and The Eden House to remix. The band played a main venue set at the Whitby Gothic Weekend on 1 November, where they issued a free CD-R named Monked Up the Sky to fans by way of apology for the delayed album release. The remixed and remastered Open the Sky was eventually released through Resurrection Records in the UK and digitally on af-Music worldwide in January 2010. The album received a raft of excellent reviews and the band's profile raised another step. In January 2011, Rhombus released The Anywhere EP, a four track release composed of the song \\"Anywhere\\" and two new tracks \\"Timeless and Elegant\\" and \\"Nowhere\\". Carey was once again given mixing duties and produced an extended remix of \\"Anywhere\\" to complete the EP. 2011 saw the band pick up their first European dates, their debut being in Berlin in support of former Skeletal Family and Ghost Dance lead singer Anne-Marie Hurst.

It dates back thousands of years as many Navajo people have relied on traditional medicinal practices as their primary source of healing. However, modern day residents within the Navajo Nation have incorporated contemporary medicine into their society with the establishment of Western hospitals and clinics on the reservation over the last century. In addition, medicine and healing are deeply tied with religious and spiritual beliefs, taking on a form of shamanism. These cultural ideologies deem overall health to be ingrained in supernatural forces that relate to universal balance and harmony. The spiritual significance has allowed the Navajo healing practices and Western medical procedure to coexist as the former is set apart as a way of age-long tradition. Health and traditional belief =Illness= Illness is described as the manifested mental or physical consequence brought on by a disruption of patient harmony. Some causes of this disruption include taboo transgression, excessive behavior, improper animal contact, improper ceremony conduction, or contact with malignant entities including spirits, skin-walkers and witches. Breaking taboos is believed to be acting against the principles devised by the Holy People that withhold personal harmony with the environment. There are some cases in which illness is merely the result of accident. Personal injury or illness can be the error from lack of judgment or unintentional contact with harmful creatures of nature. Illness can also be brought on by malevolent practitioners of negative medicine. This belief in h√≥chx«´ÃÅ, translated as \\"chaos\\" or \\"sickness\\", is the opposite of h√≥zh«´ÃÅ and helps to explain why people, who are intended to be in harmony, perform actions counter to their ideals, thus reinforcing the need for healing practices as means of balance and restoration. Those who practice witchcraft include shape shifters who intend to use spiritual power and ceremony to acquire wealth, seduce lovers, harm enemies and rivals. Ill health is also believed to be brought upon by chindi (ghost) who can bring about a kind of ghost sickness that leads others to death.Davies, Wade. Healing Ways, Navajo Health Care In The Twentieth Century. Univ of New Mexico Press, 2001. Occupational roles =Medicine men= Navajo medicine man Nesjaja Hatali, 1907 Navajo Hata≈Çii are traditional medicine men who are called upon to perform healing ceremonies. Each medicine man begins training as an apprentice to an older practicing singer. During apprenticeship, the apprentice assembles medicine bundles (jish) required to perform ceremonies and assist the teacher until deemed ready for independent practice. Throughout his lifetime, a medicine man can only learn a few chants as each requires a great deal of time and effort to learn and perfect. Songs are orally passed down in traditional Navajo from generation to generation. Unlike other American Indian medical practitioners that rely on visions and personal powers, a healer acts as a facilitator that transfers power from the Holy People to the patient to restore balance and harmony. Healing practice is performed within a ceremonial hogan. It is common for medicine men to receive payment for their healing services. In the past, healing was exchanged for sheep. In modern times however, monetary payment has become a widely accepted form of compensation. Women can also play the role of healer in medicinal practice. =Hand tremblers= Hand tremblers act as medical diagnosticians and are sometimes called upon in order to verify an illness by drawing on divine power within themselves as received from the Gila monster. Typical services can be provided in the form of songs, prayers, and herb usage. During a diagnosis a hand trembler traces symbols in the dirt while holding a \\"trembling arm\\" over the patient. Movement of the arm signifies a new drawn symbol or a possible identification to the cause of illness. Once a solution has been found, the patient can be referred to a herbalist or singer needed to perform a healing ceremony. Mechanisms of traditional healing =Ceremonies= A number of healing ceremonies are performed according to a given patient situation. Some chants and rites for curing purposes include: * The Blessing Way rite is usually done over pregnant women or any person for promoting good health and prosperity. The ceremony is the most frequently used one and resembles how the Holy People acted to create the world and establish harmony. * The Enemy Way rite is done as an exorcism to remove ghosts, violence and negativity that can bring disease and do harm to host health and balance. * The Night Way is a healing ceremony that takes course over nine days. Each day the patient is cleansed through a varying number of exercises done to attract holiness or repel evil in the form of exorcisms, sweat baths, and sand painting ceremonies. On the final day the one who is sung over inhales the \\"breath of dawn\\" and is deemed cured. =Herbs= See Navajo ethnobotany for a list of plants and how they were used. Navajo Indians utilize approximately 450 species for medicinal purposes, the most plant species of any native tribe. Herbs for healing ceremonies are collected by a medicine man accompanied by an apprentice. Patients can also collect these plants for treatment of minor illnesses. Once all necessary wild plants are collected, an herbal tea is made for the patient, accompanied by a short prayer. In some ceremonies, the herbal mixture causes patient vomiting to ensure bodily cleanliness. Purging can also require the patient to immerse themselves in a yucca root sud bath. Any distribution of medicinal herbs to a patient is accompanied by spiritual chanting. The Navajo people recognize the need for botanical conservation when gathering desired healing herbs. When a medicinal plant is taken, the neighboring plants of the same species receive a prayer in respect. Despite this fact, the collection of medicinal herbs has been more difficult in recent years as the result of migrating plant spores. Popular plants included in Navajo herbal medicine include Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), Wild Buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.), Puccoon (Lithospermum multiflorum), Cedar Bark (Cedrus deodara), Sage (Salvia spp.), Indian Paintbrush (Castilleja spp.), Juniper Ash (Juniperus spp.), and Larkspur (Delphinium spp.).Roebuck, Paul. \\"Navajo Ethnobotany - Din√© Nanise and Ethnobotanical Analysis of Early Navajo Site LA 55979.\\" . N.p., 2007. Web. 16 Dec 2011. [drarchaeology.com/publications/earlynavajoethnobot.pdf] =Sand paintings= Sand painting is the transfer of strength and beauty to the patient through various drawings made by a medicine man in the surrounding sand during a ceremony. Elaborate figures are drawn in the sand using colorful crushed minerals and plants. Many sand paintings contain depictions of spiritual yeii to whom a medicine man will ask to come into the painting in order for patient healing to occur. After each ceremony, the sacred sand painting is destroyed. U.S. government influence during the 20th century =External aid and reliance= As prompted by the Meriam Report in 1928, federal commitment to Indian health care under the New Deal increased as the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Medical Division expanded, making medical care more accessible, affordable, and tolerated by the Navajo populace. Increased demand of BIA medical care by Native Indians conflicted with post World War II conservatives who resented government funded and privileged health care. Growing interest in Indian termination policy in addition to unaided medical attention called for a transition of medical affluence by both native and non-native parties. Under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, funding was provided for the United States Public Health Service to gain a \\"Division of Indian Health\\" which would help provide a stronger federal commitment to health care. This division would later be renamed the division of Indian Health Service. Despite its initial successes, the Indian Health Service on the Navajo Nation faced challenges of being underfunded and understaffed. In addition, language barriers and cross- cultural tensions continued to complicate the hospital and clinic experience. =Preserving tradition and promoting identity= Expanding Western medical influence and diminishing medicine men in the second half of the 20th century helped to initiate activism for traditional medical preservation as well as Indian representation in Western medical institutions. With the coming of the 1970s spawned new opportunities for Navajo medical self-determination. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act 1976 aided local Navajo communities in autonomously administering their own medical facilities and prompted natives to gain more bureaucratic positions in the Indian Health Service. The gained presence of native people in medical institutions also helped ease many who regarded non-Navajo medical providers with mistrust.Schwarz, Maureen Trudelle. I Choose Life: Contemporary Medical and Religious Practices in the Navajo World. Univ of Oklahoma Pr, 2008 Community medical care that relied less on government involvement also took root in Rough Rock and Ganado, both towns that administered their own health care services. Navajo Nation Health Foundations was run in Ganado solely by Navajo people. In expressing identity in the medical community, the Navajo Nation took advantage of the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act to create the Navajo Health Systems Agency in 1975, being the only American Indian group to do so during that time.

The difference between the two lies in their scope and approach. Chemists and physicists are trained differently, and they have different professional roles, even when working in a team. The division between chemistry and physics becomes diffuse at the interface of the two branches, notably in fields such as physical chemistry, chemical physics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics/chemistry, materials science, spectroscopy, solid state physics, solid-state chemistry, crystallography, and nanotechnology.  Scope  Physics and chemistry may overlap when the system under study involves matter composed of electrons and nuclei made of protons and neutrons. On the other hand, chemistry is not concerned with other forms of matter such as quarks, mu and tau leptons and dark matter. Although fundamental laws that govern the behaviour of matter apply to both in chemistry and physics, the disciplines of physics and chemistry are very distinct. Physics is concerned with nature from a huge scale (the entire universe) down to a very small scale (subatomic particles). All physical phenomena that are measurable follow some behaviour that is in accordance with the most basic principles studied in physics. Physics is involved with the fundamental principles of physical phenomena and the basic forces of nature, and also gives insight into the aspects of space and time. Physics also deals with the basic principles that explain matter and energy, and may study aspects of atomic matter by following concepts derived from the most fundamental principles. Chemistry focuses on how substances interact with each other and with energy (for example heat and light). The study of change of matter (chemical reactions) and synthesis lies at the heart of chemistry, and gives rise to concepts such as organic functional groups and rate laws for chemical reactions. Chemistry also studies the properties of matter at a larger scale (for example, astrochemistry) and the reactions of matter at a larger scale (for example, technical chemistry), but typically, explanations and predictions are related back to the underlying atomic structure, giving more emphasis on the methods for the identification of molecules and their mechanisms of transformation than any other science.  Approach  Although both physics and chemistry are concerned with matter and its interaction with energy, the two disciplines differ in approach. In physics, it is typical to abstract from the specific type of matter, and to focus on the common properties of many different materials. In optics, for example, materials are characterized by their index of refraction, and materials with the same index of refraction will have identical properties. Chemistry, on the other hand, focuses on what compounds are present in a sample, and explores how changing the structure of molecules will change their reactivity and their physical properties. The two sciences differ in the role that theory plays within the discipline. Physics can be divided into experimental and theoretical physics. Historically, theoretical physics has correctly predicted phenomena that were out of experimental reach at the time, and could be verified only after experimental techniques caught up. In chemistry, the role of theory historically has been a retrospective one, summarizing experimental data and predicting the outcome of similar experiments. However, with the increasing power of computational methods in chemistry, it has become possible to predict whether a hypothetical compound is stable or not before experimental data is available.  Training  In a typical undergraduate program for physics majors, required courses are in the sub-disciplines of physics, with additional required courses in mathematics. Because much of the insight of physics is described by differential equations relating matter, space, and time (for example Newton's law of motion and the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism), students have to be familiar with differential equations. In a typical undergraduate program for chemistry majors, emphasis is placed on laboratory classes and understanding and applying models describing chemical bonds and molecular structure. Emphasis is also placed in the methods for analysis and the formulas and equations used when considering the chemical transformation. Students take courses in math, physics, chemistry, and often biochemistry. Between the two programs of study, there is a large area of overlap (calculus, introductory physics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics). However, physics places a larger emphasis on fundamental theory (with its deep mathematical treatment) while chemistry places more emphasis in combining the most important mathematical definitions of the theory with the approach of the molecular models. Laboratory skills may differ in both programs, as students may be involved in different technologies, depending on the program and the institution of higher education (for example, a chemistry student may spend more laboratory time dealing with glassware for distillation and purification or on a form of chromatography- spectroscopy instrument, while a physics student may spend much more time dealing with a laser and non-linear optics technology or some complex electrical circuit).  Careers in chemistry and physics  According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (United States Department of Labor), there are 80,000 chemists and 17,000 physicists working in the United States as of May 2010. In addition, 21,000 chemists and 13,500 physicists teach in high school. Chemistry is the only science that has an entire industry, the chemical industry, named after it, and many chemists work in this industry, in research and development, production, training, or management. Other industries employing chemists include the petroleum, pharmaceutical, and food industry. While there is no industry named after physics, many industries have grown out of physics research, most notably the semiconductor and electronics industry.

He also founded The Red Maid's School. Life Whitson grew up in Clearwell in the Forest of Dean, and came to Bristol to start his career. Apprenticed to Nicholas Cutt, a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1570, he lived in a house on Corn Street.McGrath, P, John Whitson and the Merchant Community of Bristol, The University of Bristol, 1970 Cutt died in 1582, and it is presumed Whitson continued to work for his widow, Bridget, whom he married in 1585. They had their first child 8 months later. Following the wedding, John Whitson became a wealthy merchant in his own right. Whitson was a merchant and alderman of Bristol. He was Sheriff in 1589 and became Lord Mayor of Bristol for the first time in 1603. Whitson had shares in two ships, the Maryflower and the Seabrake (which would later give their names to houses at The Red Maids' School), that brought home enemy prizes in the 1590s. Whitson decided that the prize cargo had belonged to poor sailors attempting to supplement their income with extra trade, so rather than stealing from the poor, he sold his share of the prize and gave the money to the almshouses of Bristol. In 1605, he was elected Member of Parliament for Bristol in a by- election to replace Sir George Snigge who was raised to the Bench. During this time, Whitson also helped to re-establish and govern the Society of Merchant Venturers which had become moribund in the later sixteenth century. Whitson‚Äôs first wife died in 1608 and he remarried within the year to Magdalen Hynde, the widow of a London merchant, William Hynde. He was re-elected MP for Bristol in 1614 and he was Mayor of Bristol in 1616. Whitson married his third wife (and third widow), Rachel Aubrey, in 1617, she outlived him. In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Bristol. He was elected MP for Bristol again in 1625 and 1626. In 1627 he gave a charity of ¬£500 to be divided between five young men being \\"meer merchants\\", and an unspecified number of handicraft tradesmen and freemen of Bristol. W R Williams Parliamentary History of the County of Gloucester Whitson was hurt by a fall from his horse, his head hitting an upturned nail by a Blacksmiths, which was the supposed cause of his death at the age of 71. He was buried at St Nicholas' Church on 9 March 1629 and, as he was Captain of the trained bands of the city, they attended his body to the church and the musketeers fired three volleys over his grave. His monument in St Nicholas described him as \\"a worthy pattern to all who came after him\\". Whitson‚Äôs will gave specific instructions for provision for \\"one woman ‚Ä¶ and forty poor women children\\" who were to be taught English and sew, to attend church, and were bound to their teacher for eight years. Each child was to \\"go appareled in red cloth\\", as per the boys educated at the Queen Elizabeth's Hospital school, thus founding The Red Maids' School as the oldest girls‚Äô school in the country.

Gameplay Amstrad screenshot The player is trapped within the three floors of a subterranean maze. Their task is to search for the missing keys whilst avoiding the monsters guarding them. Each time that the player finds a key and returns to the starting point, a bomb is activated and must be defused within a limited time. There are 5 skill levels, level 5 being the hardest. There are seven keys to be found. Key one has to be found first, then returned to the players starting place. Immediately after returning the key the first bomb starts ticking. If the player does not find the bomb in time then they will lose a life, if they find the bomb in time, they will then have to return to their starting place. Now the player must find key one and key two before returning to their starting place. Immediately after returning a new bomb begins ticking. The sequence repeat with a new key being added until the player has collected all seven keys. At the top of the screen there is a radar screen which shows the players position as a solid white dot and the monsters positions as flashing white dots. The player starts the game with a limited number of grenades, which if used at the correct range will destroy a monster. The number of grenades remaining are shown on the top left of the screen. The three floors are named Zeta, Alpha & Delta. The player starts on Zeta floor. The keys and the bomb can be on any floor. When they are wandering around the maze they may occasionally see a key with a higher number than the one they are looking for. The player can only pick up the keys in numerical order. To change floors they will need to use lifts. A red coloured lift will take the player down, while a blue coloured lift will take them up.

The $19.4 million reservoir opened May 7, 2005, is deep and has a capacity of 1 billion gallons. History The reservoir is constructed on the site of an abandoned gravel pit, the authority purchased the property in April 1996 for $810,000, which was mostly funded through a 30-year lease to a communication company for a cell phone tower. To prepare the former gravel mining site for use as a reservoir existing buildings and debris were removed, including approximately 33,500 tons of steel slag and 7,000 tons of Kaofin, a legally dumped by-product from Marcal Paper corporation. An additional 1,000,000 cubic yards of overburden material were excavated and removed from the site. At the time of the reservoir's construction it was only the second fully lined reservoir in the United States. The reservoir's design is based on an existing lined reservoir in Colorado. The reservoir's liner is 40 mil think and covered by 18 inches of soil with a narrow rock breakwater surrounding the shore line to protect against wave erosion. The design life of the reservoir is anticipated to be around 75‚Äì100 years. Recreation There is a public perimeter trail which encircles the reservoir.

Description Clancy Sigal, writing in The New York Times, described the novel as a study of faith under pressure: \\"Almost in thriller form, it is also a wise and illuminating meditation on the labyrinthine forces at work in a Roman Catholic Communist country like Poland (where Mr. Moore served with a United Nations relief group after the war).\\" According to critic Jo O'Donoghue, The Colour of Blood deals with the problem of how the modern Catholic Church \\"is to live in tandem with the secular authority\\". In her biography of Moore, Patricia Craig describes The Colour of Blood as a protest against intolerance, \\"with fanatical Catholicism presented as a destructive force. At the same time the Cardinal himself stands for another kind of Catholicism: moderate and incorruptible, and not unaccommodating of theological uncertainties\\". Awards It won the Sunday Express Book of the Year award in 1987 and was also nominated for the Booker Prize.  References  External links *Clancy Sigal. \\"Cardinal Bem on the run\\".
